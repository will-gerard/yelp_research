Such a gem of a place in the heart of town. We were looking for a place to go to for a celebration dinner and while driving down 7th Street we chanced upon Coronado Cafe.   The cottage feel about the restaurant appealed to me immensely. And to add to the appeal was the 'limited' menu. They took ages to prepare our order but the wait was well worth it. The bourbon and cherry BBQ chicken was oh so delicious! My husband ordered the roasted pork tenderloin, it was a little too rare for his liking but he voraciously devoured it nevertheless.   I must admit that it was a little difficult to read the dinner menu because the only thing illuminating it was candlelight. Our only disappointment was that we never got to taste the creme brulee because they had already sold the last one when we ordered it. We have been on the look out for good creme brulee in Phoenix and we will ask Coronado Cafe to reserve one for us the next time we drive down to Central Phoenix.

I quite like their pizza.  This tiny little shop on Northern Avenue has a seating facility for approximately 16 people but they have quick turnover during lunchtime and the place is exceptionally well run for a small business.   When I went there I wasn't very adventurous with the toppings, just stuck to plain old pepperoni and mushroom. They prepared the pizza right in front of us, the service was quick and the huge slice was so hot that I could hardly hold it with my fingers. They seem to be making changes to and improving their business every week.  My colleagues and I are definitely going back to Stumpy's to try their subs and more.

When he moved to Phoenix my husband did a thorough search of all apartment rentals in Southeast Phoenix and the Chandler area. I commend him for the meticulous job that he did in picking out this lovely gated community for us.   Although it looks the same as a San Brisas or a San Montego it is still much better that any of these places. One of the reasons could be because San Melia charges a premium for the same floorspace. Besides, the neighbourhood is good, in fact a little bit of research on the internet revealed that it falls under the 'low-crime' zone of Phoenix police.   During the summer months the pool gets a little crowded with the residents and their acquaintances but recently the office sent out a communique limiting the number of guests that can be brought in.   I have read mixed reviews about the office staff at San Melia on different websites ... to be honest I have never had a bad encounter. Living by the 48th street or next to the tot-lot might get a little noisy at times but apart from that this place is convenient, safe and enjoyable.

If you see my rating do not be under the impression that I disagree with Renee P. However, I must say that there were quite a few good experiences at this place that compensated for the broccoli side-dish that never arrived.  The 20 minute wait during the peak dinner hour was spent in observing the flurry of activity in the kitchen. They have an open kitchen floor-plan that keeps the restaurant abuzz.   I have to mention Keith in this review, the recent import from New York who is still getting used to the lack of public transport in Phoenix. He along with his fellow waiting-staff members seemed to be full of good cheer. In fact one even sang a little Italian opera for the birthday girl at the next table.  They started us off with Tuscan bread and Italian butter (olive oil, ground pepper and parmesan cheese). The Penne Rustica was average but the Chianti Steak was absolutely delectable. For dessert the Italian sorbetto is a must try.   I'm certainly going back for the other stuff that looked interesting on the menu. I hope I get my broccoli side the next time I am around.

What an amazing family run business that serves no fuss food. They get brisk business and most people come in for takeouts. Both the chicken and the meat gyros are fresh, served on warm pita bread, daubed with tzatziki sauce and some interesting onion-tomato seasoning. The fries are hot and without any trace of staleness. The flaky, syrupy, nutty baklava is a must try- get it for take out, microwave it for 10 secs and enjoy the goodness!!!  Derek r. has compare the place to Spices but I feel it is difficult to compare uniqueness, love Niro's for its own reasons and the same goes for Spices.

My life in Phoenix would be incomplete without B&N. This store is just round the corner and over the last year it has been there ~ when I needed a break from everything (I believe that books can transport you to a world beyond everything) ~ when hubby and I bought movie tickets (at the theatre next to it) and had to keep ourselves occupied until the movie started ~ when my in-laws from India wanted to venture out by themselves and I had nothing else to suggest within walking distance  ~ when I needed to read up the latest business magazines ~ when I absolutely had to check out the John Grisham my friends were talking about ~ when I felt like indulging in a tall cappuccino and some red velvet cake etc I could sit around for hours at this B&N, when I'm retired I probably will.

Situated right beside the awesome Cornish Pasty Co., at first glance this place comes across as a curio shop. There are show windows decorated with Islamic art pieces and carpets. This restaurant scores points on the ambiance. Unlike other dingy South Asian places that I've been to, this one has a sealed-out kitchen to keep their customers from a smelly experience.   Since the menu is predominantly Pakistani and Mughlai it is best for vegetarians to skip this place unless of course they are happy with a couple of paneer dishes, Indian breads and appetizers. It is also useful to be aware of the slow cooking that goes into Mughlai food that makes it flavourful in a different way. People who visit this place expecting a mish-mash of spicy curries might be disappointed.   When we went there we found that a young fellow was managing the show. We went ahead with the lassi, palak paneer, naan, sindhi chicken biryani and the lamb curry. Satisfied with the first three courses we wanted to round up our dinner with phirni. The young fellow (presumably the owner's son) wanted to pass off kheer as phirni but since we knew the difference we cancelled the order.   Overall it was a good experience and we'll be going back for more.

I didn't want to write a review for this place because my husband loves it and I love my husband. However after a recent dose of South Asian food in New York we believe that Phoenix has a lot of catching-up to do. The more we condone the production of greasy fare on dirty plates the more we fall behind. Pull up your socks buddies because soon my newly educated husband will also fall off your patron-list!

Sunny yellow paint with bright pictures and a curio cabinet makes for an interesting country theme and The Good Egg displays it well.   Personally, I am not a big fan of breakfast places because I feel that there is nothing exceptional that these restaurants hash out apart from greasier versions of items that one can easily prepare at home. That is why I pick and choose being careful not to overspend on unexciting breakfast.   The Good Egg came as a pleasant surprise. They have crepes, frittatas and gravies on the menu besides the usual pancakes, omelettes, bacon and sausages. The crepe-egg called 'light one' was served with a buttered English muffin and a bowl of fruit. The biscuits and gravy was scrumptious.   I think we are going to drop I-HOP in favour of The Good Egg when my hubby gets into his occasional eat-out-for-breakfast modes.

This place is rightfully in Paradise Valley. The 125-acre sprawling resort located on Mummy mountain is a little piece of paradise on Earth. Their customer service is stellar and the suites are grander than anything I have experienced before. It is an experience to just hang around the property. Nothing like playing a game of golf, getting a spa treatment in the lap of luxury and eating a light lunch at 'Sprouts'. Since we all know that luxury comes at a price it is advisable to visit this place on a special occasion or get someone to fund your visit. I've been to Camelback Inn on several occasions for business so in a way it is a "free lunch" for me everytime!

The secret to some good shopping at UO is to make a trip to a store (like the big one on Mill Ave.), try on the clothes, check the size that fits you, examine the material, colour and the accessories, come back home and order over the internet.   All too often there is a substantial difference between the marked price of their store merchandise and the list price on their website. And this was mentioned by their own staff.   There are just too many things in the store that you'd like to own so it is good to know the best way of going about the purchase.

This store looks like one of those thrift stores from the outside but it takes seconds before you realise that they have an exquisite collection.  My mom-in-law stays away from dark coloured garments because she is dark-skinned herself. Banning 'dark' makes it even more difficult for us to find appropriate swimwear in stores that revel in gloomy spandex. After rummaging through the over-priced tacky swim suits at Nordstrom and Macy's I breathed a sigh of relief at WWWS.   The lady in the store, probably the owner, assisted us as soon as we stepped in. After assessing our requirements she directed us to the right racks. My mom-in-law pulled out atleast 10 good ones in her size and fit. We walked out with a fabulous swimsuit is olive green and red.

This is a humble eatery, a pleasant surprise in the midst of a sordid neighborhood. The restaurant is choc-a-bloc on a weekend evening. So it is best to arrive around 7 pm, not later than that.  As indicated on their menu they start preparing the food only after the order is placed leading to a considerably long wait (45 mins to one hour). However, during the waiting period their customers have quite a few occupations like looking at the paraphernalia on the walls, sipping margaritas, devouring the crunchy tacos, listening to the loud Spanish music or looking at what other people are eating.   Whatever their clients choose to do, there comes a time when the waiter places the hot plate on the table, they pick up the fork, take a mouthful and then there is calm in the din of Los Dos Molinos. In fact there is a near- Nirvana experience with every bite of the carnitas or enchiladas.   At the end the brusque manner of the waiting staff is forgotten, so is the long wait and restlessness.

I see that people have spoken at length about this place. Here are a few pointers that I thought will be useful in addition to what has already been said...   I'm a bit surprised that no one has talked about the rice noodle rolls yet. I would highly recommend this Cantonese stuff (filled with beef/ pork/ shrimp). As opposed to the steel bowls that they use in serving the other steamed items, they serve the rolls in an oval plate and they pour sweet soy sauce on it right before serving.   Be sure to order some green tea with your food because the hot liquid cleanses your palate and is sure to make the glutinous food more enjoyable.   With respect to the desserts it is foolish to order western pastries here. I observed that the Chinese were ordering sweet tofu and mango tofu. We tried the latter and found the taste and consistency to be similar to custard.   You might encounter a couple of waitresses with heavy Chinese accents but do not hesitate to ask someone else for help. There are plenty of people to explain the grub to you.   Visiting the place on Sat/ Sun is especially important because on busy days the restaurant is bursting at the seams and the kitchen is turning a great deal of fresh food all the time. Between 11.30 am and 12.30 pm the wait could be 20-30 mins but there is no waiting for the food after you get a table.   Caveat: please do not turn up in the evening be it any day of the week.... the dim-sum is served only between 11am and 3pm. Of course one can order the other stuff off the menu in the evenings.

My advice to the owners is that they should separate the snackery from the grocery store.   South Asians flock here for finger licking chaats (N.B: the word 'chaat' literally means 'lick') and Little India serves up some great tangy blends. The seating is a little cramped and the tables are not always cleaned on time but the food hits the spot in a way that makes you want to come back for more.   One important point to note is that none of the items on the menu bring the heat quotient and therefore may also work wonders for foreign taste buds.  This is an Indian place that I sincerely wish could market itself better and make a name for itself in the valley's restaurant scene.

We live very close to AMC Ahwatukee and visit this place often.   Although the facade is neat and tidy and slick bars embrace the movie hall what lies inside is a different story. I totally second Earl's comments on the cleanliness of the place...   In addition, the popcorn that they serve is not as crunchy as it should be. If you make the mistake of adding butter to it you might have to discard the whole thing... believe me when I say that that butter smells like coconut oil (I'm Indian, I know what coconut oil tastes like)   I'm not sure who runs the place but sometimes they make strategic mistakes like running a relatively new movie in one of their smaller halls. Recently we had to watch 'The curious case of Benjamin Button' in a tiny theater. The old lady beside me was probably suffering from flatulence and when we couldn't bear it anymore we came away..   So people, if you have a choice.. STAY AWAY

This place makes me realise that there is tremendous business potential for another Indian grocery store in the Chandler area. The owners hit the jackpot with the location and that is why they take every liberty to dole out substandard groceries.   The expiry date is never mentioned on the packaging and if it is, it is usually wrong. The other day we bought some chapatis (Indian bread) with 22nd June '09 expiry clearly marked on it. When we opened the packet for dinner we found nothing but green fungus. On another occasion we bought some solidified pickle. There have been innumerable disappointments but we kept going back because there was no other option nearby.   The first lesson that we learn in a Marketing class is that 'the customer always wins' and for now I have decided to shift my purchases to another store in Tempe.

All I remember of this place is a glum-faced family acting as greeters, waiters, cashiers and probably as the chefs. I don't know whether they were having a bad day or we went there at a bad time (Sunday dinner) but this experience was probably the worst that I have had in the valley.   The Mourgh Challow was good but the Koufta Challow was in no way pleasing to the palate. The baklava was cold and as hard as stone. When we couldn't finish the food and asked for boxes, they handed us only ONE box for both the rice and the gravy. I was quite startled by this move...   The enthusiasm that I had built up about this place after reading all the glorifying reviews has been dampened by the horrible service that we received in an empty restaurant with average food. However, instead of swearing by this one-time experience I am still prepared to give them the benefit of the doubt.

The happiest Vietnamese place that I have been to in Phoenix. The accompaniments like the Sriracha and Hoisin sauces are neatly arranged on the table, the decor is warm and welcoming.  The Pho is probably the best in the valley and the Bun is good too. Among the beverages, the Thai ice-tea is especially good, better than the tea at the Thai places that I've been to. Average price of the entrees is approximately $8.29 and the helpings are huge.   The reason I give it 4 stars is because we had to change places as the back area was a little smelly.

It was hard for me to believe that a non-American convenience food (similar to the Indian samosas) could become so popular in Phoenix. This restaurant gives me a new perspective, and I think that a fast-food nation could in fact get elegantly poised over a hot plate of Cornish heaven. Such is the power of this convenience food.   The bangers and mash is the closest to the original recipe of the pasty and therefore is a must try. 'The Italian' is scrumptious but is not the smartest thing to go in for at a British eatery. For a more wholesome meal a side of mushy peas seasoned with salt and pepper is a good order.   The decadent mix of colonial English interiors and ultramodern music weaves magic on Pasty Company customers, making them want to come back time and again.

This is the one and only place where you can get good coffee at the Anthem outlet center.   After a day-long shopping expedition and lunch at the limited food-court we required a coffee break. Since there are no coffee retailers around that place (like Starbucks) we enquired at the customer service kiosk and they told us that we could check at the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory.   The franchise owners were extremely friendly... Although there is no sitting place in the tiny shop, they seemed to be serving their customers just fine.   The quality of the chocolates cannot be compared to Godiva or even Lindt but the quaintness of this place and the smell of fresh cocoa makes up for it.
