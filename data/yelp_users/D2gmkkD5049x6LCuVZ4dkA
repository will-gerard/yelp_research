Just to make this clear on how bad this place sucks for karaoke, I am on my iPhone right now while I am here to right a review. I got off work at 10 and came by here for the first time cause I heard this place was awesome for karaoke. Little did I realize HOW wrong everyone was. I walk in and my ears start to bleed. The singers were a collection of the worst singers I've eve heard. The crowd was mainly made up of people twice my age, and I'm 26. The drink specials were decent but the bar was SMALL!  There are MAYBE 10 tables in the whole bar. I will NEVER come back here unless for some reason I really want to feel better about myself.

This is the only review you need to read. I will not be biased on my experience, but I'll shoot it straight.  Lets start with Barry, because honestly, he's the only reason why you wouldn't buy a suit from Men's Apparel Club, because the suits are amazing and his prices can't be beat.  Barry is from Chicago originally. Born from in an era where being politically correct and having a verbal filter was an option at most. He's also retired. "Then why does he own a suit shop if he is retired", you may ask. The answer is simple. When you retire, you have a plethora of time on your hands and not much to do with it. He owns a suit shop because he ENJOYS it and he is doing what he loves. He doesn't do it for the money, because frankly, he makes $40 off each suit regardless of how expensive it is. He's not in it for the money, and the lack of f@ck$ he gives about selling or not selling a suit can't get any lower. He's going to tell it how he sees it. He's not going to sugar coat anything. If he doesn't get a good vibe from you, or doesn't like you for any reason, he'll make it very clear and you'll be promptly told to leave. Now, with that being said, if you come in and are respectful, understanding that his knowledge on the matter at hand far exceeds yours (as he does this for fun and has been for over 20 years), and you are sincerely apologetic if you do something that might send you packing, you will have not only an amazing experience buying a suit, but you will also get some great advice and entertaining stories. At Men's Apparel Club, the customer is almost never right, so don't come in here with your inflated sense of entitlement. Check your ego at the door and be prepared to bask in the wisdom he offers and the radiance of how suave you'll look after he helps you find the perfect suit.  Now, on to the suits. I went in expecting to get one, maybe two suits. I left with $685 worth of gear. 3 suits, 6 shirts, 10 ties, some cufflinks, and a couple stories he shared with me that I will not soon forget. He did not push any sales on me at all. Didn't heckle me to buy anything, but just showed me how friggin' slick I looked in the suits. The suits are what sold me. They are top quality at prices that made my jaw drop. I worked at a law firm downtown and would go into JoS. A. Bank on occasion and find cheap (quality) suits starting at over $1,200. I went to Men's Apparel Club and found a better looking and better quality suit for $185. WOWZERS! Honestly though, my favorite suit I bought was on clearance for $69!! Now his tie selection is second to none. There are nearly 300 UNIQUE ties on his wall, all of which are color coordinated. I could easily have spent an hour just going though each one. He knows exactly what he has on his tie rack, and was able to grab a specific tie from the back center section instantly that matched my shirt/suit combination so perfectly that I was in awe. The funny thing is, I would never have grabbed that tie in a million years, because I normally hate ties with flowery looking designs, but I was stunned at how that combination just POPPED!  As with anything, when you go shopping for something and have little to know expertise on the item it is your shopping for, it's almost a guarantee that you will walk out having bought a stinking pile of manure. At least this is the case with me when I try and buy clothes as I am an I.T. guy with about as much fashion sense as your average programmer. You'd never know it now having the pleasure of purchasing from Barry. I could go to New York and dine with the Wolves of Wall Street and no one would think twice that I didn't fit in there at first glance. My wife on the other hand has forbade me to wear these suits for anything other than job interviews as she said, and I quote, "I have no desire to follow you around with a bat while I swat at the 'birds' (not the original word she used) trying to hit on you like they are fruit flies going for your ripe banana." Okay...okay...that isn't exactly what she said, but I knew what she was thinking when she looked at me after trying them on for her and her eyes quickly lit with the fires of hell when she thought of what it would be like when I walk around in public looking so gosh darn handsome.  Now, any good review must have more than raving compliments. So here is the ONLY con that I can come up with, if you can even call it a con. Barry is not a tailor. When you buy a suit from him, you will need to have it professionally tailored someplace else. For me, that wasn't an issue as one of my in-laws is a professional tailor, so I was okay with that. If you ask him nicely, he can tell you of a few local tailors that have been in business for a few decades, but he will preface it by saying that it is not a recommendation as he does not know them or their quality of service. Your best bet is to hit up Yelp again for something that might fit your needs.

I had to go back through my previous reviews, as I was unsure if I had already reviewed this business or not. I was shocked to see that I hadn't. Rachel, the owner, is a great gal and is incredibly friendly and helpful. Since she is a custom florist, you would tell her your price range, and she would arrange something for your needs. Be descriptive on what the occasion is for, and you'll be pleasantly surprised at how perfectly she captures the moment with her arrangements. I bought from Rachel a few times now for my wife. I bought when she gave birth to our son, and again shortly after when we had our anniversary, and a few other times for different occasions. I called this morning to get an arrangement only to find out that she has closed Flora Unique.  I don't know if she will ever open it back up again, but I sure hope she does. She is the best at what she does, and I would always prefer to support small local businesses like this. My prayers go out to her and her family, and I hope that she will someday reopen for business!

First off let me preface by the fact that I am extremely lazy and don't normally review places, no matter how good it is. With that being said I took the time out of my extremely unoccupied day to make this review. That is how awesome this place is!  I have been here twice now, and the first time I ordered the green chili pork and short rib enchiladas. The second time around I got both short rib. The short rib has an amazing flavor, it just pops in your mouth!  The cotija cheese and habenero lava sauce are both fantastic. This last time I even tried a side of the herbal ranch, which was, you guessed it, great! I also tried a side of their cornbread this time around and was glad I did. With actual corn and a hint of spiciness to it, it was a great addition.  To top off this great meal, they even have alcoholic beverages. Pacifico being my favorite, I got that my first time through. After which I realized he had a cream soda on tap, and boy do I love cream soda! So this time around I got the cream soda, and my wife asked if they made margaritas. Which they did, so she got one. A pink grapefruit Margarita is what they served her, and it was very delicious! A little too strong for my wife, but I didn't mind finishing off for her.  For under $30 for a family of three and one alcoholic beverage and one soda, I will gladly be coming back here on a regular basis! I highly recommend this to anyone in the area or even if you have to make a bit of a commute. Every Phoenician should try this place at least once. Unless it's on a night I choose to go, in that case, go a different night. Parking is very limited and I'd rather not park across the street... ;-)
