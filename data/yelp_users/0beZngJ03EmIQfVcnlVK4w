Wow, I love this place on Sundays! The patio and the music make me feel like I'm on a beach in Cali! Great mental escape.   The sangria (3-stars) was not the best I have had but was still good. The bruschetta (5-stars) was really unique and really good. I also had a sandwich and soup. Both were about 4-star quality. Our server was AWESOME! 5-Stars to him! He was hilarious. I don't think he was trying to be funny but he just was. Great personality and he seemed to really like his job. The live music....5 STARS! The musician was talented and he played for about 2 hours. From Bob Marley, Jack Johnson, to Dire Straits. All summer type music, and all very well executed.   The place was busy so it did take a while to get food, but I was relaxed, had my sangria, and had good music so all was right in the world:) The parking could be a problem but I got lucky and was able to pull right in. The bathrooms are unisex....eeeewh....but clean. As long as they remain clean I will keep my rating at 5 stars, the minute that changes....it will be 4 stars.

The price is GREAT! Mom and I went there for Pedi's and for 2 of us it was $37! The pedi was 45 min, it was clean, and both techs were men (doesn't bother us in the least). They have all the standard colors in OPI. Pretty much it was your basic pedi. Foot soak, trim cuticles, buff, callous removal, foot massage, spa style massage chair, add color to toes and out the door. I have had the color now for almost 2 weeks and only minor chips are visible. All-in-all I am absolutely satisfied. The only down side, and it is a bit sad....but I think they live at the nail salon. If anyone has questions shoot me an email and I will elaborate, just be prepared if you go in there and have to use the bathroom. I don't want to give them less stars for doing what they need to do to survive, but I also don't want readers of this post to be unprepared. I will be going back with my friend when she comes to visit! Her peds usually cost $40+ so she will be very impressed that I found such a reasonable place that does such a good job.

I had lunch here today. I love the owner, he is awesome. Always friendly and he tries so hard to make everyone happy. I had the raw beef pho and it was very good. Not the best I've had but definitely up there. I also had the spring rolls. A little too much mint for my liking but they were fresh. All of the veggies were beautiful. Fresh and lots of flavor. My beef was pretty good too. The fat had been trimmed completely so I was thrilled. I hate fat. It hit the spot with me and I will continue to go back. The service is great and fast. Overall a nice experience.

Had dinner here last night and it has gotten better! Everything was super fresh and yummy! The food is totally authentic and reminds me of my travels in Asia. I think I will be going here more and more now that it is fall/winter for the Pho. The bbq is also REALLY good!

Ya, not the best golf course I've been to. The grass needs lots of work, and there are tons of pigeons! I hit 2 with balls! I felt really bad, because they would get hit, lose feathers, and fly away scared. I am not into animal cruelty and I have no idea why I had the luck of hitting 2 of them, but toooo many birds on the range. I will go again because it is close to my house, but I have been to much better courses for sure. Sorry Dobson! I have to say it like it is.

Great service, good food and felt great after! I really enjoyed my dinner her. The food wasn't too spicy and the margarita was really good! We even had the man with the guitar sing to us and he was awesome! I will definitely go back! Best part of our meal was that I felt great after. The last time I had Mexican food that I didn't make I felt horrible the entire night. The quality of the kitchen and the ingredients must have been very high!

I don't love the coffee at Starbucks, but this place is getting 5 stars for their service! They are quick, ACCURATE, friendly, and they always remember my drink even though I only go there about once a week! Amazing! The staff is great and I thought I should leave them a nice little "Good Job" on Yelp!

I am always on the look out for reasonable $$ spa pedicures that still keep the quality fairly high. I found Rose Nails when I had to mail something at the Post Office next store and I was happy that I did. I was running late to my go-to place and therefore got bumped. My fault, not theirs:) I didn't leave work on time. :( I remembered that I saw Rose Nails on Dobson and Guadalupe and decided to give it a try. It was much bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside. They had an opening so I quickly grab a polish (didn't like the color once it was on.... but oh well) and sat my booty into the spa chair. They have a range of pedicures on the "menu" from basic ($18) to deluxe ($60). The basic is what I usually get since I go about once a week. I am very hard on the "peds". The technician was one of the owners and he was pleasant and just let me read my gossip magazine without needless chit-chat. The "basic" includes a foot soak, polish removal, file, cuticle work, light callous work, foot and lower leg massage and application of polish. The pedicure is supposed to last about a half an hour, but he really took his time and my pedicure was about 45 min. Nice! Thanks!!! I think he gave me a little extra in the massage department. It was much needed. Over all it was a great experience. The reasons I didn't give it 5 stars were as follows: 1-the place could have been a bit cleaner (the shop seemed cluttered and unorganized), 2-a basketball game was playing on both TV's and didn't really give the "spa" atmosphere, and 3-my callouses are still pretty rough. I still really like my go-to place but this one comes in at a close second.

So here's the deal. I walked in the store, a person greeted me (good) and asked what I needed (also good). Here is where it gets bad. Now I have to admit that I just got done working out at this new and might I add awesome place ..... I will write about that later, so I was a little "un-kept". Hair a bit messy, workout clothes on, slight smell.....but anyway, the sales pitch began. Right off the bat I could tell that she worked off of commission. Do you really need to be THAT desperate? What kind of plan do you have, I can up-grade you, blah, blah, blah, nothing she said was really that bad or unexpected, it was just the condescending way in which she was saying it. Like I said, I didn't look like a super model, BUT I have been into other ATT stores and have been treated very well wearing a similar gym inspired outfits. Basically the lady hated her job and was trying to get me to spend mega $$ on something I didn't want or need and when I told her what I really wanted and needed....i.e. a phone that has just the basics (I'm not that tech savvy and I am constantly breaking them) she just became rude, as if she had something better to do than show me a couple of freaking phones. Now I could have been a little understanding if the store was busy, but it wasn't. Only myself and one other customer were there. That was the point where I just walked out with no phone in my hand:( I will just order it online. It boggles my mind that in this economy sales people can afford to be rude to potential clients. I'm sorry but I went in expecting service, choosing to go to their physical location to purchase a phone. I should have just stayed at home and ordered it online.

Simple! 1) Rude Staff 2) High Prices (Double in some cases) 3) Pretty much no return policy, which really pisses me off. When you go some where specifically to get fitted for shoes, and they do it incorrectly, then you can't return them! Really! BAD BUSINESS ALL AROUND!

This place has everything you could want or need for Halloween! Just got done shopping and had a great experience. The staff was nice and helpful, the store is full of costumes and all the accessories you could want. Considering it is so close to Halloween they still had a great selection.

I have been here a couple times now, so I thought I should review it. The ticket prices are a bit higher than other theaters, but the drinks are cheaper....a wash I guess. I saw the Mechanic there this week and had an overall pleasant experience. Usually I hate going to the movies because of all the sick people coughing on my head but this time the theater was relatively empty and I had a blast. The sound system in the theater we were in was great. Clear and crisp. The movie quality was also good. The concession stand was quick, in and out with my food and drinks. Yep, definitely one of the better theaters in the valley.

Had a great coffee there this morning. I really liked the location and the open-air feel of the place. It was very comfortable and easy to find. The coffee was good. I had the vanilla latte and it was a bit too sweet for me but the texture of the drink and the taste of the coffee was pleasant. The service was a bit slow considering it was not busy, but overall I had a very positive impression. I will definitely go there again, however, it is a bit pricey.....FYI.

My friends and I had a great time at Happy Hour last night! The drinks were good and the food was great. We had almost every appetizer on the menu and all of them were fantastic! The staff was a bit slow but very nice and friendly. The manager came over to our table and was quick to ask how everything was. All-in-all it was a great experience:)

I had the most spectacular toffee nut frappe! Seriously, I was in caffeine heaven. I think they gave me a large by mistake, but I didn't mind. My friend ordered a tea and that was really good as well. I have been here a couple of times and will definitely continue to go back. The service is good and the drinks are consistently excellent!

The staff was soooooo nice! I was looking for something specific and inquired with one of the many associates working. She said that they had run out of their inventory, but thought one of the mannequins might have been wearing my size. Sure enough, that mannequin had my pants on:) To make a pleasant shopping experience short, I pretty much bought out the entire store and was extremely happy with my purchases. They are a bit pricey, but the quality of their clothing is worth every penny, plus my new perky butt looks amazing:) !!!

I went to the wellness fair yesterday and had an interesting experience. Some of the vendors were a little pushy, some had a hard time explaining how, or why something worked and some were awesome. I had a lot of fun at this event. It was open to the public and seemed to have a very good turnout. There was a little bit of everything....toe readings, massages, facials, waxing, herbalist, life coaches, chiropractors, artists, natural cosmetics, energy readings, teeth whitening....and the list goes on. It was a good way to check out the facility and see what they and the community had to offer. Additionally they held a silent auction. I didn't stay around till the end but things were going for reasonable prices. Over all I really like the facility, the vendors and the atmosphere. I will definitely go again next year, but I will plan to stay a little longer.

This place was GREAT! I had lunch at Green yesterday and I have nothing but good things to say. The food was excellent! Much better than I expected. The staff was very nice. The atmosphere was fun and lively. The only things that I was not thrilled about is the seating. Basically you have to run to an empty table, bus it yourself, and if the table isn't empty you have to intrude on people that are getting ready to leave. I don't mind asking people if they are done with their meal but I felt a little awkward doing it, like I was rushing them..... The other negative is the way that the staff screams your name when your food is up. I think if they implemented a number system the whole place would function more efficiently. Overall, the experience was pleasant, the food was great, and the prices were reasonable. I will definitely be going back.

I am very upset with SRP and their inability to work with my new small business. I was charged $1800 as a deposit, $90 for "set-up" fees, and now I am additionally being charged a service fee of $60 per bill on top of the actual charge for electricity, which comes out to more than 20% of my total bill. I have called them 3 times during the 6 weeks I have been in business and no one has been able to work with me on any of these issues. The staff is friendly but completely ineffective. From my experience, I am dealing with a monopoly that is blind to the current recession. I am doing my best to establish a thriving working business but with all the additional fees and charges I am spending on electricity, I am being nickel and dimed into debt. I am not asking to not pay my bill I am only asking that my service fees be reduced to a more reasonable rate and not 20% of my total bill. This to me is an unfair practice that preys on people working hard to stay afloat. The only option that was given to me is to let my account go into collections. Again ridiculous! I should be able to pay my bill on time without being over charged. All I am asking for is a fair rate!

Another $1500 deposit! Really! I hate all of you! Might I add that I DO pay my bills in full every month and have never been late! .......but yet I am still considered "high-risk"! Did I mention I have perfect credit!?! Someone needs to take this monopoly down. If there are any other power companies out there please let me know I will switch my service in a heart beat.

I will definitely go back here! The prices are a bit higher than the other nail places around this area, but overall a good experience. My massage chair was broken:( but these things do happen. I had a great pedi and they totally up-sold me on callus removal. Not sure if I really needed it but I think I might do it again once summer is over. The staff is friendly and the place is CLEAN! Also the hours are great! They seem to be open most holidays and the place is always packed.

I have to say that I hate "big-box" gyms, but I had a really pleasant experience at this 24 Hr. Fit. The staff was really nice and not pushy at all! I appreciate that a lot! It is really big, and has lots of equipment and space. The bathrooms are clean BIG PLUS! and the TV's are up to date with good resolution. Over all this is the nicest 24 Hr. Fitness I have been in.

I LOVE Trader Joe's. I don't really like the other customers since they always seem to leave their carts in the middle of the aisle so that no one else can pass.....you know who I'm talking about! BUT the staff is always awesome, and the place is immaculate. It is easy to find things (except for olives) and the food is sooooo good. I always look forward to my shopping trips:) Thanks for being Awesome Trader Joe's!

I had a really nice time at PCL. My drinks were very good and the staff was awesome, very attentive, and polite:) The DJ was ok, nothing to write home about and the clientele were mediocre at most. Total sausage fest, and not in a good way. The bathrooms were CLEAN! That is why I added the 4th star. Overall, the management must be doing something right, because the place was packed and the staff was awesome. I will definitely go back.

Service was great but both my boyfriend and I ended up with a touch of food poisoning. I think it was from the chicken on a stick appetizer. We both ate that and it was the only common thing we ate. I will not be going back to the Pink Pepper:(

Not good at all. My experience in a nutshell.  1) The place smelled like meat that had gone bad.....hope they aren't selling it!!! 2) Over priced....big-time, almost double for some items when compared to the other Asian markets in town.  3) Small selection of everything. 4) You have to have at least $10 in merchandise to use a credit card/debit card. Really! This is 2010, I haven't carried cash in years. Pretty much a bad experience over all. I have been there twice now and pretty much had the same experience both times. I will not go back anymore.

I have only have one service at True Harmony, but I am definitely going back for more! I was having some severe sciatica on the left side of my lower back and leg that had been going on for weeks. A friend of mine suggested I go see one of their massage therapists since she was awesome. I booked my appt and went in. I CAN NOT remember her name.....sorry, but she was awesome! She took the time to ask about my pain and history, and what I have been doing to try to correct the problem. Then she suggested that I get a Cranial Sacral Massage. I loved it! Yes it did hurt a bit because I was already in pain, but she was able to give me additional mobility in my lower back and helped to reduce the pain I was in. She also gave me some tips for where to ice my back and for how long. The staff was very knowledgeable and helpful. I purchased a gift certificate for a different girlfriend who also has some back issues. She hasn't used it yet, but I'll report back when she does:) My next appt will be another massage and a facial! I'm so excited!!!!

I am a boba tea enthusiast! This is the BEST place that I have found in the Phoenix area. The prices are about average and the tea was not too sweet. The boba is the best! I think it is the one made from taro root. However...the Asian market a couple doors down was sub-par, do your best to avoid it if possible.

Pretty good! The Boba wasn't my favorite, but the tea was very tasty and made specifically as I asked. I like the milk teas best. My friend had the slushy version and she said it was pretty good too. The staff was fast and the atmosphere of the place was clean and lively! Nice place!

I went to Su Vino on a Sunday. It was totally empty. I really liked the decor and the atmosphere. Here is my break down: 1) Flight of Wine - 3 stars. The wine was just OK. Not great, not good, just OK. The blended Cab is the only one that I felt was truly good. They do let you bottle your own wine if you would like, but I would be embarrassed to give one as a gift since it wasn't that great. Anyway.....back to the breakdown.  2) Service - 5 Stars. The service was excellent and the staff was very friendly. That goes very far with me! The pourings were prompt, but not rushed, the food was nicely prepared and brought to us quickly, and the server was very bubbly! :) 3) Food - 5 Stars. The food was excellent! We ordered the large cheese plate and the stuffed strawberries! Both were heaven! I love, love, loved the strawberries. Amazing. If you go there you have to try them! I will definitely go back. Thanks Su Vino!

I had a great lunch at Whole Foods today! I went looking for something they do not stock anymore :( and ended up eating a surprise lunch. I had an "ok" sandwich but my significant other had a chicken teriyaki bowl and it was AMAZING. I probably could have eaten 3 of them! I was pleasantly surprised. It was good, fast, and not too expensive!

Great little place that makes you feel like your in a city, not the Valley. We had pretty good service. I had 2 tea-tini's and they were supposed to be the same but they were drastically different. I'm not sure what I got, but both were good. The waiter did take one off of our bill, which I thought was sweet. I also had the house salad which was very good and FRESH! For my entree I chose the salmon. It was fantastic. I literally cleaned my plate. There was NOTHING left when the waiter came back to remove my plate. I'll admit I was very hungry, however I am picky when it comes to fish and my salmon was cooked perfectly. It was also seasoned nicely. Not too salty or with other overwhelming spices. Yummy, my mouth is watering just thinking about it:) I am going back again and I will probably order the same thing. I'll let you know how it is the second time around!

Fantastic Humus! Yummy! I had a great experience at Pita Jungle the other night. My group and I were sat at a table promptly and our drink order came out quickly. The service was just ok, the waitress forgot one of our appetizers and it ended up come out after our meal:( eeek. But other than that mishap, everything tasted great! The prices are moderate and it had a good atmosphere. I also checked out the bathrooms and they were clean and tidy! Thumbs up for that! Next time I'm craving humus I will go back:)

I have been to this location a couple of times now and it is just not that good. The sushi is pretty expensive and twice I have receive pieces that didn't look quite right. I never eat "ify" sushi. The rainbow roll was pretty good but the sashimi was questionable. The Miso is awesome and so are soy beans. Over all the service is always pretty good, however I did have one crappy waitress. She was rude and slightly condescending. I was not dressed to impress.... had a impromptu lunch date with a girlfriend and apparently I did not belong there. FYI I'm not ugly or a slob, but my hair was in a pony tail and I wasn't wearing makeup! So shoot me! Point is, she was rude and I didn't feel welcome. The hostess was very nice though. I think I am going to avoid this Ra location from now on.

Ok, so I don't do crafty things, but today I decided to check out JoAnn's. The store was very nice over all, lots of new goodies, but the section I was in near the fabric was a complete mess. I called prior to going to make sure they had what I needed, but once I was there, they didn't have what I was looking for. Ugh, I was so pissed. The store was totally out of my way, a big waste of time. I ended up getting something else, but it needed to be measured. NO ONE WAS AROUND. This other lady and I waited and waited.....nothing. Finally I went up to the front of the store to have the checkout person measure my material. She was very pleasant and quick to apologize for no one helping me. The staff that was around was nice and friendly, but the lack of organization and poor management was really upsetting. The management at this location definitely needs some retraining. Do they have store auditors????

Oh Boy! Just found out that the extensive work performed on my 4-Runner many months ago was likely done to another vehicle. This could explain why my transmission is being "clunky". Ugh! So frustrating. I should have read the previous Yelp reviews before taking my car that was perfectly serviced in perfect condition here. I have always taken my car to the dealer to get serviced and have never had a problem until Riverview. I just emailed the manager to see how they would like to proceed with my complaint. I will update you all as soon as I know.

I walked in with very high hopes and walked out very disappointed. It really reminded me of one of those weird grocery stores in London where all the food is pre-packaged and icky. All I really wanted was a head of lettuce and some nice produce. I walked out with nothing. EVERYTHING is packaged. I had know idea!! This place is anything but Fresh. Easy yes....fresh no. I will stick to Trader Joe's.

Thank you for an awesome quick meal In-N-Out Burger! I used to eat here all the time in college, but now it is just an occasional "treat", need to watch the waistline. Last night there was no food in the house, I got home from work late and I was too tired to go shopping. In-N-Out Burger Saves the Day! The usual long line of cars were in the drive thru, but the line moves fast. We pulled up, placed our order, 3 minutes later I am eating the best burger I have had in a LONG time:) Ahhhh my tummy was happy! I don't like their fries, so I just got a cheese burger and a rootbeer. That was all I needed to satisfy my temporary starvation. My other half had the Double Double and 3 orders of fries (he like the fries, to each their own). Cynthia served us and she was too cute and very nice:) I'll be back in another couple of months! See you then!

Great quick service and a friendly staff! I had a nail in my tire and they promptly fixed it for no charge and I was in and out in 30 minutes with no appointment. The last time I went to Costco for a tire fix, it took them 2.5 hours! Really Costco! I will definitely go back to Mike's for other repairs as they come up. It is close to my house and from the other reviews, it looks like they are the only fair priced mechanics in the area. I'm so glad I found them:)

I met my girlfriend at the Living Room the other night and we had a blast. The food was really good and the drinks were AMAZING. The staff was pushing wine but I wasn't in the mood for that so I tried one of their "skinny" cocktails. I was a blueberry martini and it was soooooo delicious. It was the perfect place to relax after work. The decor was very nice, similar to that of a large living room:) Leather couches, long drapery, dark wood furniture, etc.They also have live music. Usually I'm into it but not that evening. His amp was up way too loud for an acoustic performance and we had problems having a conversation, but other than that it was a pleasant experience.

I have only had the tea here but it is pretty good and they are open late on the weekends! This is the only boba place open till 10 pm which is about the time I find myself craving a tea:) The staff is awesome! The place is clean and newly remodeled. They have a new expanded tea menu which is nice. The boba has never been "perfect" though, it is always a little too chewy and somewhat over cooked. A couple of times I have gotten teas where the boba was in a big solid lump at the bottom of my glass. Not optimal. BUT over all it is a good place with a great vibe.

I was SOOOOO disappointed with the aquarium:( I had really high hopes and was very excited to go and it was just blah. I don't think I would call it an aquarium as much as it is some fish in smallish takes swimming around in circles. The kids seemed to like it but it doesn't hold a candle to the Monterrey aquarium. It seemed to be some-what educational and the animals seemed healthy, but almost all the plant-life and corral were fake. In fact the tanks of fish they have at Cabala's are much more fascinating. Anyway, my advise to you is to save your $$. It is not worth the price at all. I hope the AZ zoo is better.......

4.5 Stars!  I went the Canteen with a small group for happy hour and was very Happy! The happy hour was great! About half of the food menu and a third of the drink menu were included in their happy hour! BTW: where ever you see HH = happy hour:) It took me a minute to figure that out;) Their HH items are half off.   The service was good. The 2 servers we had helping at our table were nice and fast, I just wish they had come to our table a few minutes before HH was over to let us know. I would have ordered another margarita!   The food was really good. I had the fish tacos. Yummmy. They went perfect with my margarita!   The restaurant was nicely decorated and clean! We sat outside and loved it! They have heaters if you need them and one of their outside tables can fit 8 people very comfortably without sitting crazy far away from each other.   The damage: 5 margaritas, 2 orders of tacos, plus tip = $35 Not too shabby:)

The Single slices might be cheap but if you order one of the big pizza's it's crazy expensive. I ordered one of the meat combo pizza's in the "Big Jimmy" I think that is what they called it and it was $45! No Joke! Now if the pizza was amazing I would still think it was expensive but worth it. I did not find the $45 value in the pizza I received:( It was SPARSE on toppings and the dough was under cooked. We brought it home to eat but literally threw away 1/3 because it was just crust no toppings...... The photos someone posted are very accurate. Stick with the slices if you eat here.

Same Day Service! Donny from Swimming Pool Butler saved my swamp of a pool after that crazy dust storm. He was very friendly, located close to my house and fast. My pump wasn't working. I had done the backwash a couple times and cleaned the filter and nothing. By the time I had Donny come over the pool was a green muddy mess. BTW I am a renter and know that the pool equipment is old, but was not looking to spend a fortune to fix it. $80 later and I have a clean, swim-able pool again:) Oh almost forgot. He will answer your questions via phone. He is very personable and friendly.

I tried XO Nails with my mom yesterday and they were great! The price for a basic spa Pedi was $22 +tip. My tech was ok, but my mom's was awesome. I think he was the owner. The space seemed clean and well taken care of. I didn't give them 5 stars because they kept trying to up-sell me. I was like, "no", and "no thank you" at least 4 different times. My Pedi was $22 my moms with the up-sells was close to $40, almost double the original price. The staff was friendly but the selling was a bit overboard. Mom still enjoyed it though, so all is well.

Loved this theater. It is really far to get to from my house but I will go back. The staff was AWESOME! The place was really clean and the seats were comfortable. I didn't order any food because we had just come from dinner. But we want to try the food next time. Thanks for the comfortable movie watching experience.
