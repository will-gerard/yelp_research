LOVE THIS PLACE. It is not pretentious but rather a great place to grab a bite with people who are glad to see you. Friendly staff, sometimes Wally will actually greet you and get your drinks. Great menu with salads and typical pub style fare but also awesome salads. Always recommend you ask about the special of the day. There are some great ones.   I have not been for happy hour, but I will admit, the beer on tap and whiskey selection appear to be enough to satisfy any happy hour need.   By the way, Tuesday is Ta-tor Tot Tuesday & the sweat potato fries can make it a toss up. So check it out...you will be back.

One of my most favorite places! We happened along this place by accident while enjoying a "stay-cation" at a local resort. We were starving and not looking to pay resort prices for dinner. A quick little drive and we saw a sign that said pizza. The best accident we had!  Location is in a strip mall and not terribly inviting, but go anyway because once you hit the front door it's like you walked into a friends house. Great smell from the kitchen and a small little bar with plenty of good beverages and cold beer.  So take a look at the menu, ask for suggestions. The sausage is homemade and fantastic. My favorite crust is the thinner "crispier" crust. and there is no expense spared on toppings smothering edge to edge. So if you like to actually enjoy your toppings & sauce not just get a mouthful of dough this is your place.   Word of warning, everything is big! The small salad easily feeds three & do try the garlic ranch dressing. The spaghetti is good, with homemade meatballs and the sauce...well let's just say the sauce is more of a sweet sauce full of taste and not just tomato paste. So our favorite pizza has quickly become the peperoni & sausage. We like to add sweet peppers too. But really you can go wrong. And even the Margarita pizza is outstanding.   We have dined in & they deliver. Just got to the website & place a web order. Pizza was here in no time.   I love taking out of town friends & family here because it is local owned & operated. A great family place and reasonably priced!

ONLY GO IF YOU ARE HUNGRY! We just moved to the area and were intrigued by the sign & the fact the place always seemed packed. Plus we have an affinity for locally owned joints. I ran into to get a couple of cheese steaks one day for lunch...the "WHOLE" cheese steak is like a loaf of bread. Totally worth it, but we ate them for like 3 meals. Very very good.   So decided to dine in the next time. The large pizza is plenty...really. The wings are above average. We will order them again, but not the best I have ever had. Beer is cold & the soda refills just keep coming. Lots of people having a good time both times we have stopped by so far.   Staff was very friendly & very efficient. They move you in & out quickly.  It is a bit pricery than I expected, but good food & great service.  We will be back.

It was love at first bite. Great location, great urban hip vibe. And the food rocks.  Ok, first things first the fries. Sweat potato is not usually my thing but these are fantastic with the Cinnamon & sugar. The garlic & rosemary are fantastic as well.  Always ask about the specials cause there is something good cooking in the kitchen's.  The FEZ burger is a great layered combination of meat, aoli, pear (yes pear) and BBQ. All very good.  If you are headed in for lunch, get there before noon on a weekday, the place fills up quick. Sitting out side is great for 7 months of the year.

Love this place.  Ok don't let the exterior fool you. Yes it is a strip center. Yes you are in North Scottsdale. But for a pint of Guinness happiness...seriously get out of your car.  So this place is cozy and relaxed. Great for lunch or to relax after hours.  If you get a burger, be hungry or share.  That is all I'm gonna say.  And the fries...awesome.  They are crispy shoe strings of goodness to please your taste buds. The ruben is pretty good and sloppy. Will say, what the fish sliders.  The tarter sauce is...different?  Get close to the bar and check out the rotating seasonal beers if you are deviating from Guinness. (but really who does that in an Irish Pub?)  There are plenty of great whiskeys to taste.  Basically, this is your great hang out pub to enjoy and not got to the run of the mill.  Great mix of beverages to please one and all.  Enjoy!

After a long day we wanted something good and we found it. Great relaxed atmosphere, full bar service (the Margaritas looked fantastic). The menu had great choices and our server was extremely helpful with recommendations from appetizers to full meals, steak, fish & even vegetarian dishes. The chips were fresh and the salsa was a great puree with a smoke chipotle spice. Very good. I highly recommend the chicken lettuce wraps, even though this is a Mexican food place, they were AMAZING! The guacamole is made on site and excellent as is the queso. We ended up with appetizers which were perfect for the 3 of us to share 3 different plates. Next time thought I may have to try the black bean & corn enchiladas or one of the chimi's or the fish tacos...yeah I will be back because there is a lot to try.

Great menu. I had never had middle eastern food and this was a great first experience. I had the Chicken kisara. EXCELLENT   We were on a fast time frame for lunch in between meetings and using Yelp with previous reviews, we choose Fattoush, reviews & location where driving forces. I will definitely be back and more adventurous with each visit.

Don't...really Don't...keep looking, get satalite, GOD FORBID don't do interenet.  The service is slow, if you call in the folks are as depressed as you are.  And goodness knows if you have to move out of the service area it is a huge disconnection fee.  Their excuse, will it's a contract.  REALLY! You don't service where I moved to.  That is the best you can do?  UNBELIEVEABLE! So if you are moving to the area, do yourself a favor, steer clear of Cox.

Great kicked back location. We usually hit it at least once a week from our office for lunch. Fantastic Fish & Chips. Like fish not too deep fried with a heavy coating. The sweet potato chips are quite good, only complaint, no cole slaw...not that you need it with this hearty helping...but it is a routine I have gotten used to as a fish & chips fan. Burgers are disappointing as they are just average for the price. Good beer selection & the hot wings are fantastic! I haven't been on the weekend, but during the week it can become a busy place at lunch. Lots of TV's that make it look like a great place to catch the game.

The food was just meh, and my stomach still hurts. The beef was gristly and salty in the orange beef.  The orange rind was too much in the dish. Truly the dish was straight up awful.  The crispy green beans - normally a favorite were just less than mediocre. I am a fan of PF Changs, but this was terrible.  A true reminder that not all chains are created equal.  Stay away from this store. I was not feeling well at all later.  Kudos to staff, attentive great and trying hard.

What a great find! Located off of Yelp after a business meeting in the area & we were hungry before we hit the road. Very comfortable space, lighting is good so you can see each other & your food which is not always the case. The decor is not overwhelming but extremely comfortable, some TV's, Thai decor & more pop music on the overhead. The staff was extremely attentive from the moment we walked in through out the meal. My Jasmin iced tea never got to the bottom. The menu has great variety. The pad Thai was excellent as were the vegetarian rolls. The Tom Ka soup was excellent. Every member of our group got something different and they were all extremely happy. We will be back. Pricing was very reasonable. There is patio seating available. Check it out.

What a great little place.  We happened in on a lark & were very hungry.  The menu is very suprising with lots of good options to check out.  The staff was extremely helpful.  The look is a bit more modern or industrial which seems to be all the trend.  The food for the price, very good & well worth it.  And we will be back.  Besides I love the open kitchen so you can see what's going on with your food.  And any place with an option for buffalo...well enough said.  See you there soon.

James was fantastic, he was easy to work with as far as scheduling. He was on time & got the job done quickly. The quoted price was right on and the quality of work was outstanding. I was so pleased with the way the floors looked after he finished. I highly recommend, you won't be disappointed!

The quintessential local spot that is hip, excellent food & service. But like an eariler review states it is cool but "not trying to hard".  A great place for groups or smaller parties. It definitely gets busy, and parking is vallet.  Just a great sense of style, taste and casual place to just hang out.  Excellent food, a great combination of different flavors and styles.  Service was excellent, prompt and attentive.  Full bar, excellent wine menu and beer selection.  The salads are excellent, very generous portions,and combinations of flavors.  Make sure you always ask about the specials.  Absolutely incredible.  Generous portions, you will be happy you popped by!

Ok this place is HIGHLY OVER RATED! I really would pass. The food was mediocre are best, slightly cold when served. Asking for refills on coffee or ice tea was like waiting for Congressional Approval...   The menu looks enticing overall, even gives one hope, but seems to fall desperately short of combining what promises to be really good combination of flavors.   Unfortunately the service was just as abysmal. Nice people, sweet, like molasses's about the same speed.  There are so many great places in the Metro Phoenix/Scottsdale Area.  Don't stop, keep on driving or go to Einstein Bagels next door. You will be much happier.
