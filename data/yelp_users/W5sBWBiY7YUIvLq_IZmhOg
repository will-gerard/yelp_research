Gotta give it 5 stars.  I wouldn't change a thing about it, from the ambience to the server to the food quality.   To start, like a reviewer said before me, the valet parking does seem to be for the actual Vincent restaurant, rather than for the Bistro.  And yes, there is parking in the back.  **Another note**:  The Market Bistro only takes reservations for parties of 5 or more.  Two of us went at 7:00 on a Tuesday night and were seated immediately.  What we ate that we actually ordered:  Lobster bisque, salmon quesadillas, coq au vin, seafood skewers.  What the server brought-- for free for us to try-- which we ate but hadn't ordered:  The butternut squash ravioli, mini pumpkin chocolate brownie with ice cream on top.  (And of course the mini croissants at the beginning of the meal.)  Everything we ate was beyond fantastic, with one exception-- the seafood skewers were a little bland.  Not "bad" by any means, just not as flavorful as seafood can be.  The real standout was the butternut squash.  Our second favorite was the salmon quesadillas.  EXCELLENT.  Even better:  our entire bill, including my friend's glass of wine and my soft drink, was $48!!  I will go back again and again.  (And to all you thriving young bucks, this would be the perfect place to take a first date-- classy and unique, yet unpretentious, with amazing food and a manageable cost.  Score!)

Won't be going back.  I am always looking for a good Mexican place-- on a specific search for the best guac in greater Phoenix--, and one of my coworkers thought we should give it a try.  The one good thing is the decor inside- it really is nice.  Now on to the "no bueno" portion of our program... In summary, the food was bland, the food was cold, the service wasn't that great, and the salsa and the guacamole were just plain WEIRD.  No need to overexplain bland and boring food (I had a chicken burrito, and I added cheese, rice, and sour cream), but I do want to point out that I ate GRISTLE in my chicken... which is what finally made me stop trying.  Other items to note:  1.  The server would barely glance at us, and when she came to ask for our order, she hadn't even asked for a drink order first.  Also, we had to ask twice for more tortilla chips.  I will say, though, that our main dishes came out fast... but mine was ice cold.  2.  The flavor of the salsa was okay, but the texture was-- as another Yelper has described-- exactly like ketchup.  Bizarre.  3.  The guac.  Oh the guac.  Horrific.  The first question was the pale green color.  My friend and I spent at least 4 full minutes trying to figure out what one would mix with avocados to get that exact Lawrence Welk-era seafoam color.  There was no onion, no peppers, no lime, NO flavor.  After a few additional samplings (more out of morbid curiosity than anything), I came up with EGG.  Yes, like hard-boiled egg whites.  Color and texture.  Bweck.  To my food-loving compatriots out there:  don't do it.  Not worth your time or money.

I dig this place.  I have only ever eaten here for lunch, but I have been here a kabillion times, and I love it.  The only 2 negatives are the parking and the SEMI-cash-only situation.  Meaning, this place DOES take credit cards if your order is over $25!  A lot of other Yelpers have complained that the male owner is a little rude, and his wife (I think?) is the other owner, and she has always been okay.  I guess I am from the east coast, so they seem totally fine to me, but I can see where AZ people think they're a little gruff.  Whatever... I am not paying them to be nice-- I am paying them to cook me some awesome grub.  The best sandwich, to me, is the Italiano because it's the best prosciutto I have ever had.  The texture and quality makes it melt in your mouth.  Also, you can have this sandwich on focaccia (my friends usually choose this option) or the homemade Italian bread, which is my choice.  It's soft and that dusting of flour just makes me all Italo-happy.  It's served with uber-fresh basil as well.  There is a balsamic dressing that is usally served on top, but I ask for it on the side, as I don't like my bread to get mushy.  Finally, the sandwich is pretty big, so it's worth the $10.  (It's gotta be $10 worth of primo prosciutto alone!)  The other key choice is the pizza.  I departed from my beloved Italiano one day (but only because I had already eaten it 2 days before) and ventured toward the pizza.  I am suprised to say that it's really great!  The crust is perfect, and it's just the right amount of doughy.  My advice is to try it.  Get there at 11:30am or 1:00pm for lunch.  Carpool.  Bring cash.  Smell the air when you walk in.  Order the pizza.  Make plans to go back and try the Italiano.  ;)

Katie's is great.  They listen to what you say, and they can even fix ingrown toenails.  Wait time has never been more than 15 minutes.  Also, Katie remembers everything about everyone!  I have tried almost every other nail salon within a 3-mile radius, and Katie's truly is the best.

I would have written a 5-star review about Spinato's anyway, but after an experience this weekend, I had to Yelp about it ASAP....  I drove from Mesa just to pick up pizza for my family (yes, it's that good), and when I was getting in my car to leave, I was holding the pizza and the box caught the corner of my rear-view mirror.  The entire large pizza spilled in the front seat of my car, all over the console, gear shift, seat, floor, etc.  It was a mess!  I tried to clean it up, but I really needed soap and water, so I went in to ask for some napkins.  The manager, Tim, overheard me ask and asked what happened.  When I explained, he immediately got me wet towels to clean up the mess and made me a new pizza, free of additional charge!  He obviously didn't have to do that, as it was not Spinato's fault in any way.  Plus, the place was packed (as usual), but he bumped my pizza to the front of the line.  If I wasn't convinced before that Spinato's is the BEST-- not just for food taste but for customer service-- I would be sure of it now!  Things to get:  the Sicilian pizza.  It's thick and awesome.  Order jalapenos on top.  They are a nice balance to the sweet sauce.  Also, get the starter salad and the raspberry vinaigrette dressing-- it's tart and perfect.  Something unique:  the spaghetti-filled calzone.  Yep, you heard me-- carbs baked inside of carbs!  :)  The servers are great, the management is great, the location is great (easy parking and plenty of it, including street parking), and the food is SO WONDERFUL!  Try one of their multiple locations throughout the valley-- you won't be disappointed.  Tip:  they don't take lunch reservations, but if you get there earlier than your appointed time, they have no problem pulling together multiple tables for larger groups.

I almost gave HOT three stars, and the only reason why I didn't is because I had a better dining experience last night than I had the previous few times I have eaten at HOT.  I want to be clear and say that the only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the food really is very good... and that's basically the point of eating at a restaurant, right?  And the service was amazing.  Our server was friendly, helpful, and attentive.  And I really do love the ambiance.  (Great date spot!)  My main issue with HOT is the price of the food, especially because the portions are quite small.  Here is what we ordered and how my friend and I felt about it: 1. The "Bloody Mary" Salad, which is tomatoes and a lot of other fresh goodies.  Delicious. 2. The seared scallops over cauliflower puree.  The scallops were good, but there were only 2 of them, and they weren't that large.  Also-- and this may be a personal preference-- but the cauliflower puree was very smooth, but such a viscous and thick texture that I wasn't a fan of it.  Also, I truly love cauliflower, and it tasted nothing like cauliflower. 3.  The mussels (which is one of HOT's signature dishes).  They are technically a starter, but I ordered them as my main course.  Honestly, I did not love them.  They were a little cold, which does no favors for mussels' texture.  Also, I don't like a creamy sauce for them-- I would rather something more wine or stock-based.  (Again, this is a matter of personal opinion, but I don't think mussels should be in something creamy.)  The flavor was good, but not great. 4..  The beef tenderloin with butter whipped potatoes and bacon demi-glace.  We ordered it medium-rare and it was PERFECT.  One of the best bites of meat I have ever had.  Basically, I feel that HOT is hit-or-miss... and that would be okay, if it weren't for the price.

I go to Andreoli's a lot for lunch because it's very close to my office.  The sandwiches and desserts are great... and the side salad that they serve with the sandwiches is so fresh with a light and simple oil and vinegar dressing.  Yes, most of the employees at Andreoli's have an Italian accent, and YES, this means that sometimes their personalities are lost in translation... but I personally love it!  The ingredients are always so fresh, and I recommend the Sempronio sandwich, especially if you are a fan of prosciutto.  I did not give the place 5 stars for three reasons:  1. it's a little expensive.  2.  Not a lot of parking.  3.  Not a lot of seating-- it gets crowded quickly.  So if you are going for lunch, make sure you are there by about 11:30.  Also, I have to add that I have been to Andreoli's at night before, and there was an opera singer... which was super cool!  **Slight amendment to original review.** I wish I could give 3.5 stars for this place.  I just got lunch there and was charged SEVEN DOLLARS for one slice of cake.  And the portion wasn't large, and the cake is dry and not very good.  Also, my friend bought some of their gourmet chocolate, and it's *ridiculously* expensive.

I wish I could give 3.5 stars.  I do love the flavor of the food, but the portions-- particularly on the tacos-- are pretty small for the price.  However, they make the guacamole for you right there at the table, and it's $9, but it's totally worth it.  I am a guacamole fiend, and I would say it's the best I've had so far in Scottsdale.  That being said, I have to say the bad:  1.  Parking not great.  2.  When we showed up, they gave our table to another couple right in front of us, even though we had reservations.  3.  They had run out of menus, so we had to wait for them... for over 20 minutes.  4.  I was most looking forward to trying the Texas grits, and when they didn't show up, I asked our server about them, and he told me he was sorry, but they were out of them.  That's fine, but I wish he had told me sooner.  However, again, the personality of the server was nice and accomodating, and the flavor of the food at The Mission is delicious.

I finally got to try Moira yesterday, which I found via Yelp, and which I had bookmarked for months.  I work in downtown Phx and really wanted to like it.  The decor is pretty, and the building it's housed in is pretty awesome, but that's about as far as the positives go.  Let me say first that the sushi isn't "AWFUL"..... but it's not "good" either.  It's meh.  And it's definitely overpriced for "meh."  (Compared to most places in Phoenix/Scottsdale/Tempe, it's at least $1 more per item.)  I will say that the spicy tuna wasn't even remotely spicy.  What sucks:  the service.  I went with a coworker for lunch, and we were not greeted, nor were we seated.  We finally went to the bar, where a server came up to us after 10 minutes, only to tell us that she would be right back.  The place was NOT busy at all.  The server came back, took our drink orders, dropped them off, and that was it.  We didn't see her for the rest of the meal and had to flag her down to get our check.  I asked the sushi chef about lotus-- I wanted to know if it had a strong flavor.  He thought about it for a minute and then said "not really."  How about "NOT AT ALL."  Which is fine-- they basically just use it for crunchy texture.  It just struck me as odd that this wasn't his immediate response.  Normally I wouldn't mention the chairs, but I have read other Yelp reviews and they are right-- they are the most uncomfortable chairs that my butt has graced in a long time.  Bottom line is that if you are in downtown Phx and want reasonably good sushi for a good price, go to Ichi-Ban on Central and Thomas.  The decor isn't as hip, but the food and service are FAR better.

The actual service is good, but the main difference between New Romantic and other nail salons is that the employees actually clearly enjoy working there.  The manager is a very, VERY nice guy.  My nails always look great and they listen to what I'm saying.  I would have given it 5 stars, but for 2 things.  First, I do not readily see how they sterilize their equipment.  Second, twice I have waited over 30 minutes, even though I had an appointment both times.  I find it best to go in the morning, as they have a tendency to get backed up by around 4:00pm.  Finally, I have read some Yelp reviews that say that this place is a little on the pricey side.  I disagree-- $20 for a complete spa pedicure that includes sea scrub and foot and leg massage is not a bad price!  Also, there have been a couple of times that I have been in a rush, so I told them no massage, and they took $3 off my total.

This is a great little place to eat.  There are three reasons that I didn't give it 5 stars:  first, the parking.  (But everyone knows that it's not easy to find parking in the heart of Old Town.)  Second, while all the food is definitely good, there hasn't been anything on the menu yet where I would say, "That's the best ____ (insert awesome food here)____ I have ever had!"  Third, the place is loud.  It was already rather loud, and then a guy started singing and playing the guitar (he was actually surprisingly good), so then patrons started speaking even more loudly to be heard over the music.  My bf and I needed a quick place to eat in Old Town before going to see a band on Saturday night.  As we left our house, I went to Yelp and booked a reservation at 5th and Wine through OpenTable, which was convenient and perfect.  We got in right away, didn't have to wait.  We didn't want to eat food that was too heavy, as we were on our way out.  So we split the butternut squash soup (pretty good), strawberry gorgonzola salad (wonderful), and the the glazed salmon (pretty good as well).    One thing I do have to mention is that the service is always GREAT.  Our server was totally cool and nice, and he split everything on 2 plates without our asking and without charging us a split plate fee.  Again, the food was very good, but I can't really rave about anything.  However, I can honestly say that if you are looking for a great place to eat that is quick, courteous, and has a lot of options, 5th and Wine is a pretty good bet!  (Especially if you like to sit outside-- their outdoor dining space is pretty and quite large, which is convenient.)

Yelp helped me find this place, as it's close to where I work.  It was great, and there are some amazing specials... 10% off a pedicure on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.  And also if you go on Mon, Tues, or Wed and you get a mani + pedi, they will give you a free eyebrow wax!    The best thing about the place is the "family" atmosphere.  I think the whole family does-- literally-- work there, and they all talk and hang out like you are in their living room with them.  I told them that I really wish I could understand Vietnamese so I could be in on the jokes.  They laughed at me and slapped my leg like I was the jokey-est jokester of all time.  It was charming.  The owner gave me my pedicure herself, and I LOVED her.  (Maybe it's because she A) rested her boobs on my feet every time she laughed and B) burped with gusto.)  However, she is part of the only reason why I gave Top Design Nails 4 stars instead 5.  She speaks zero English, so when I tried to explain that I like my nails mostly square but with rounded edges (complex, I know), she nodded her head like she understood and then proceeded to file my nails completely round, which I do not like.  I could have corrected it, of course, but I was so charmed that I decided to be "that customer" on a future visit.  I decided to get my eyebrows done while I was there-- even though I usually get them threaded elsewhere-- and the job was totally fine.  The best part is that my pedi + eyebrows was a total of $23 ($15 pedi, $8 eyebrows)!!  One more random/interesting thing to note:  the owner also does clothing alterations on-site.  Apparently, she will hem a pair of pants for $4!  I know that must of us are in codependent, long-term relationships with our tailors, but I might have to give it a try some time, due to the ridiculously low price.  All in all, I highly recommend this place.  It is definitely unique!

I won't be going here again.  I can honestly say that I didn't like anything about it.  Our server was somewhat friendly, but that's about it.  And there is a good amount of parking, given that the hotel is right there.    The bad:  1.  Server only brought one set of silverware for me and my friend, and took about 20 minutes to bring the second set.  2.  My Coke was very watery.  Found out that the syrup line wasn't working, so they went to replace it, and then came back and told me that they were out of Coca-Cola... like it's some rare thing for a restaurant to have.  3.  The spinach con queso was very runny and had very little flavor.  4.  The steak in the skirt steak taco was VERY dry and very salty.  5.  The sopapillas come out with some weird butterscotch-tasting flavor added to the honey.  When I asked the server what it was, she went back to ask the chef, and then returned to tell me, "Yeah, it's something different, but we're not sure.  Maybe it's just a different kind of honey."  What?!?  One word:  Nope.

H + M = no bueno.  It's not that great.  Seriously.  I started going to the H&M in San Francisco years ago, and I would only maybe give that one 3 stars.  H&M is great if you want something cheap to wear out for only a couple of nights.  It actually reminds me of The Limited years ago.  (Hello?  Outback Red?  Anyone?)  I will say that the men's clothes are more worth the visit than the women's clothes.

I cannot say enough about Children's Dental Village!  Even the décor is suited to children with bright colors, books, a beautiful fish tank, and even a built-in play house.  The office staff, the hygienist, Dr. Padilla, and Dr. Lepetich really made my daughter's experience a good one.  My 5-year-old daughter had high anxiety from the start, and she went in to get cavities filled.  Everyone was extremely understanding and patient.  It was easy to see that they had done this many times before and that they really understand children's behavior.  The office staff were also extremely professional, in that they called to confirm appointments, make sure I understood all of the steps (my daughter had to be sedated), and they gave me a cost estimate before I left the consulting appointment so that I didn't have sticker shock on the day of the procedure.  Finally, the day after we left, Dr. Padilla called me personally to see how my daughter was feeling.  On a side note, before the actual appointment, Children's Dental Village called me beforehand to tell me that the dentist who had originally screwed up my daughter's x-rays had, in fact, billed my insurance for them.  So CDV told me that I should check that out so that they wouldn't double bill me.  I am an educated consumer and a conscientious parent... and I will definitely be taking my daughter to Children's Dental Village until she grows out of it!

This place deserves a rare 5-star rating from me.  The food is great, and so is the service.  Price is about what you would expect at the Biltmore.  Great service points:  1. The hostess asked for my friend's last name upon entering, and referred to him as "Mr. _______ " and to me as "Ms. Hughes" for the entire time we were there.  2.  Upon seating us, the hostess looked at my black slacks and replaced the white linen napkin in front of me with a black one (SO AWESOME).  3.  The first thing the server asked us is if we were under any time constraints to get back to work, etc.  NICE TOUCH for a business day luncheon.  Things that have been said so far about Seasons 52 but deserve repeating:  1.  It definitely looks like Huston's inside, but it's a great vibe.  2.  Every item is under 475 calories!  There is no butter or deep fryer in the joint.  Therefore, the little dessert "shots" are a clever way of keeping dessert also under 475 calories. ;)  Additional items:  1.  They take reservations.  2.  There are multiple rooms for private parties and/or large groups.  If I had to change only one thing, it would be with the goat cheese ravioli that I ordered.  For me, the dough-to-goat cheese ratio was a little out of whack.  Meaning, far more goat cheese than dough.  I know that this execution of the dish is in keeping with the theme of decreasing carb intake, but it was A LOT of goat cheese.  The flavor was amazing, though, so I do need to state that this part of my review is based more on personal preference than on the chefs' skills.  I do need to mention that they have a great-- and surprisingly varied-- soup menu.  Especially now that the weather is getting colder, I am definitely going back.

Yelp sent me a note that I have eaten at Beckett's a few times and had neglected to write a review.  I am surprised, since I have been to Beckett's multiple times, and I have pretty much wanted to Yelp about this place literally as I was eating the chocolate-covered bacon S'mores for the first time... which was when the restaurant opened over a year ago.  ......So it's pretty obvious what my favorite (espcially for uniqueness and flavor) food item is at Beckett's.  But I have to say that the ribs are ridiculous as well.  I try to order other things, but I always go back to the ribs.  However, I have tried the chicken and dumplings and the pan-seared chicken too, and I have loved both.  There are only two items I haven't loved on the menu and that is the mac-n-cheese-- I think the cheese is a little runny-- and the cheddar biscuits.  They are very bland to me.  Other good things about Beckett's: 1.  The cocktails. 2.  The ambiance (it really is warm and inviting).  Personally, I love the decor a lot. 3.  The service.  The wait staff is knowledgeable and extremely personable.  They are always happy to give a recommendation, and they never seem rushed to get to another table, even when it's busy. 4.  The location and parking.  Relatively centrally located, not off a major freeway, ample parking.  **Speaking of service, I want to mention a situation that happened between me and Beckett's Table this summer.  I had reservations for a Friday night dinner, and I received a call from Beckett's on that Friday that their electricity had gone out, so they had to close down for the day.  (In fact, the electricity had gone out for all the businesses in a 2-block radius that day.)  The manager then offered to squeeze us in either the following day (a busy Saturday) or any time later in the week... at 50% off our total bill!  Not only did this display exemplary customer service, but I was even more impressed that Beckett's provided this service when the electricity problem was definitely not through any fault of their own.  If I could assign the perfect rating to Beckett's, it would be 4.5 stars, but Yelp doesn't have that option.  I usually only reserve 5 stars for "true" perfection... which I have given to only 4 restaurants in Arizona throughout my Yelp career. ;)   However, the customer service (which is really a huge part about eating out in the first place) kicked Beckett's up to a 5-star rating.  Just go there.  Just do it.  Take friends from out of town.  Order an awesome old-timey cocktail.  Sit outside by the unique and cool fireplace.  Eat the S'mores until your stomach is going to explode... and then go home happy.  :)

I almost gave this place 5 stars, but I really only give those out for "perfection."  I have to say that Citizen's Public House serves the best scallops in the city-- which is somewhat of a surprise.  They are never overcooked, and the grits they are served on are delicious as well.  The prices are a little steep, but I will say that the quality of the food and the cocktails is very high.  Also, the serving staff is AMAZING and always very friendly.  Also, you can make a reservation through OpenTable, which is always quite handy.  I take out-of-town guests to CPH, and they have all really loved it.  Again, if the prices were a little lower and if the menu had just a few more choices, I would have given it 5 stars.

Found this place via Yelp because I was specifically craving pasta, and I am a picky Italian cook.  My toddler daughter and I met 3 friends there around 6:15pm.  It was not too packed, and they immediately had a high chair waiting for our table.  The 4 of us ordered 4 appetizers (the squash ravioli, the carpacchio, the artichoke heart risotto, and the fried gnocchi), and every single one of them was truly great.  (If I want to get really specific, I will say that the fried gnocchi was a little bland, but gnocchi is bland on its own anyway, so I wasn't expecting otherwise.  Also, I will say that I have had better carpacchio... not in terms of quality, but in terms of presentation and flavor.)  Even my daughter loved all 4 appetizers!  For dinner I couldn't decide between the pasta with clams and the capellini (angel hair with tomato and basil), so Joshua (BEST SERVER!!), suggested he would split the entree in half for me so that I could try both... which was totally awesome.  Both entrees were so good!  I have to mention here that the pasta with clams is the best I have ever had-- it was NOT in a cream sauce or a red sauce.  Instead, it was in a light herb/oil sauce with fresh garlic cloves... perfect!  My friends got the veal and the chicken marsala, which were also truly wonderful.  Total bill for the 4 of us with 4 appetizers, 3 entrees, soft drinks, and 4 alcoholic drinks was $99.  Great!  For service, vibe, and food quality, you really can't go wrong with this place.  I am so excited to finally find a great Italian restaurant-- that doesn't cost a million dollars-- right by Old Town Scottsdale. :)

Great little place to eat in "old town"  Chandler.  The meat and cheese plate is pretty good-- certainly one of the best I've had in Phoenix-- but definitely not one of the best I've ever had.  Everyone else really loves the tomato bisque soup, but I don't because of the texture.  The bruschetta was definitely great, and the wine selection is good.  The only real negatives about the place are the following:  1.  The servers didn't come around very often, and the pacing of the delivery of the appetizers to soup to entrees was a little long and a little off.  (We got our soup long after our entrees, which was a little odd.) 2.  It's difficult to get a reservation, and when you do, sometimes you are not seated on time. 3.  Prices are a little high. 4.  The place is quite loud.  All in all, though, I would definitely eat here again, and every person I've eaten with at Vintage 95 loves it.  Just wish they could feel a little more "organized," for lack of a better term.  There are little things that aren't perfect, but the food is pretty good!

Let me first say that all of the food was delicious and of the highest quality.  Our table of 6 had the following: 2 ordered the flat iron steak (which was cooked to perfection, based on one person ordering medium and the other ordering it medium-rare), a salad (very fresh), 2 of us split the Bolognese (very delicious, and they split the order to 2 plates for us without charging a sharing fee), and then the burger with a duck egg.  The burger was the clear winner.  The flavor was AMAZING.  Special mention must also be made of the slice of heaven that is their starter bread that the servers bring to the table before you order.  It was some sort of blueberry/cinnamon scone-bread that is served warm with butter.  It was like dessert, and I want to eat it every day of my life.  I want to also say that the décor and ambience are beautiful.  However, here is why I did not give it 5 stars.  There are 2 reasons and one is bigger than the other.  First, the small reason.  Due to location and size of the lot, parking must be valet.  On principle, I always have an issue with this.  The second, bigger reason is that there was a hair in my piece of scone-bread, and it was baked into it, so I know it wasn't one of my own hairs.  I nicely pointed it out to the server, and the manager appeared at our table right away.  He told me he would comp us a dessert to the table for it, which was fine. ....But then my entrée arrived, and there was another hair beneath my slice of garlic bread.  I wasn't as okay with that one, because I was pretty hungry at that point.  The manager appeared again, and I could tell that he was extremely upset.  It is important to state here that they did absolutely comp my entrée.  I will go back again at least one more time because the quality of the food itself was pretty darn great, so I am hoping that the hair was an anomaly.  At that time, I will provide an updated review.

I almost gave this place 5 stars, but a few (very tiny) things held me back a bit.  First, it's in the Esplanade.  I have always found it annoying to park there and to find anything.  And yes, they do validate your parking- up to $6.  (*In case it helps any old-school Phoenix dwellers, this place used to be Nixon's.  Which I LOVED.)  Second, the food was really, REALLY good, but there just weren't a lot of options.  While I truly believe that it's better to do only a few dishes extremely well than to do 30 dishes half-cocked, I just wish there were more than 5 entrée items.  That being said, we had the pot roast and the salmon over yellow rice -- which was on special -- and both were pretty darn good.  Also, my friend and I told the server we were going to split both dishes, and the chef brought them to us himself, equally split and beautifully presented on 2 plates.  Now, again, the food was "pretty darn good"-- I had hoped that this was one of those places where I rave about the food to my friends and have a craving for something that I can specifically eat at Ten... but that wasn't the case.  Well, maybe the pot roast.  :)  Anyway, I do want to mention that since I had said it was my friend's birthday, they did comp us the 2 glasses of wine we ordered.  All in all, I really wish that I could give 4.5 stars, but you can't... and I try to reserve 5-star reviews for those places that I want to revisit about 2 minutes after I walk out.  *Ten also takes reservations, which I love.  Oh - one more random thing ---- I am a music snob and the music choice was AWESOME.  It definitely contributed to the atmosphere of the place, which was very "industrial/Thomas Edison" and great!
