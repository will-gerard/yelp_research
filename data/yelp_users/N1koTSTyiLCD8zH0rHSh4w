I had some questions about my S Corp paperwork and Michael took a look. He explained what everything meant and which was like taking a Greek language lesson but understanding it immediately. He pointed out the important parts of the documents that were there and why they needed to be. He made some suggestions but was not pushy about additional services in anyway. I would highly suggest Michael for any and all Business, Estates, and Trusts law matters.

used this as a dinner spot before heading to the symphony for a little opera and it was a perfect fit. we ate early enough to miss the crowd, place is a little cramped as noted in other reviews.  my gal and I are both vegetarians(most of the time, unless there is good eggs benedict) so we got the two veggie entrees -  Roasted Vegetable and Chevre Rellenos, shallot polenta, tomato reduction 13.5 Penne Pasta, green chile cream sauce, toasted pine nuts, parmesan 13. Both were friggin delish and wonderful and tasty and great and really really good.  service was slightly confused with who was working what area but other than that it was fast and accurate.  if you want to be romantic this is a great spot. watch out for the crowds and try to get a reservation. they wont do reservations after 6pm cause its their busy time.

This shop is located close to my house and Eric and Eli are hilarious and also know a thing or two about bikes. They also do a great job of supporting the riding community.

gotta say that this place failed on the majority. service was slow and rude. the hummus was almost all tahini, no lemon juice, and no seasoning. lentil soup was like chef boyardie chili gone bad.  i dont recommend this place at all. lots of choices in the area.

I had been researching getting a new DSLR for months for shooting video and pretty much knew that the Canon 60D was what I wanted. Went to Foto Forum to see how prices were and was surprised to find that they were selling the 60D for $100 less than BH and Amazon. Also Greg the salesman took an hour to talk with me about various cameras and lenses. He has decades of photography experience and was great at giving me feedback on what I was reading online. I bought the 60D with the 18-135 kit lens and a number of other items that will help me get started with getting serious about taking pictures and video. I hope they are around for years to come.

Eating Review of Rokerij  I want to like this place. Its a great setup and well done environment. The setting is stylish and dark so you want to sink into a booth and get down to eating some food.  Unfortunately my first experience has left an impression that is less than stellar. My girlfriend and I had been wanting to try it out a few times. We got a booth by the fireplace and settled in for a nice meal.  The specials are written up in chalk on the wall as you walk in which is a great method for displaying specials. We are both vegetarians that will eat fish and were excited by the plethora of fish dish choices on the specials board. This tends to say that a place can do fish.  Our server was nice enough but when we asked for some recommendations he stared at us blankly and grabbed the menu like he hadnt eaten there in a while. This is a huge pet peeve for me. If a place is gonna charge $20 or more for an entree the staff better be trained on the dishes and be ready to give some recommendations. Show some passion and knowledge and sell me the good stuff.  We ordered the White Bean Bruschetta to start. It was edible but lacking in flavor, maybe some salt wouldnt have hurt, but something more than just beans and toast please.  Next was the soup of the day which had a lot of smoke flavor going on, not impressed.  Finally we went with the sesame crusted fish with a melon salsa. This dish started off a disaster and just got worse. First of all the server brings it over holding it with a towel. As We shift plates around to make room he starts yelping a bit in pain. Not a great sign. Once he gets it set down we move to dig in but my lovely date brushes her arm on the plate and comes away with a pretty solid burn.  This is just plain stupid. There is no need for a plate to be 200 degrees. Cook the food and then bring it out. Dont cook it at my table on the plate!  Unfortunately the fish was not edible, at all. The melon salsa was horrid. We sent it back and still got charged.  Rokerij I want to love you. There are a lot of folks on Yelp that love you but I have to say that for food you have not impressed me.

Its always good times to find an all vegetarian spot in the valley of the sun and Vegetarian House is a supremely awesome spot indeed. I was a little worried when I first opened the menu and there were Chicken, Seafood, and Meat entrees. Then I was assured that they were all meatless.  I had the Ginger Duck and it was like eating duck! Unreal!  The decor needs some help but the food is why I am there.

Yeah for Dive Bars! A good Dive Bar to me is one where you can come in and feel completely at ease no matter who you are or what you are wearing. The bartender is super relaxed but helpful and can make a mean cocktail. The lighting is dark and moody and the jukebox has good tunes.  Dizzy's is pretty much a solid bet on all these items except for all the damn country music that some patrons think is listenable.

Great company with excellent service. They dont commission their techs so you dont have to worry about being upsold just so the tech can jack his truck up. Had an issue with our AC and they fixed it quickly. Highly recommended.

i have been practicing on and off at inner vision since jan 2008. i had to stop running due to knee pain and decided that yoga would be the way forward. i did a 6 month unlimited package and was not dissapointed. two of the owners Jeff and Michelle are some of the best teachers i have ever had. the other teachers there are great as well especially Josh who likes to get really philosophical and pulls it off without sounding pompous.  michelle's sunday afternoon yin/relax class is like dessert at the end of a weekend. you will never be as relaxed and ready for the week as when you take this class.

Was feeling rough this morning and figured I would head over to the herbalist to see what they might be able to help me with. Vicky was very helpful in recommending a few things and took her time to diagnose my condition and give me something appropriate. Its only been a few hours since I started taking what she gave me and I already feel miles better.

this is a good sushi spot. get to know the owner, yoshi, and he will treat you like royalty.  regarding the comments on price: hello! this is sushi not a hamburger, you should expect to pay for good quality. its raw fish. you dont want to be getting bargain fish when its raw. the prices are in line with the costs of good quality fish and service.  regarding portion size: this is sushi not a big meal. the portions here are correct.

I love beer so I started brewing beer. For something like brewing beer I figured and heard that it is worth going to a local homebrew store and getting the down low. What Ales Ya is the closest store to my house about 30 minutes each way. The drive is completely worth it as all other posts here point out.  We were greeted as we came in and once I let them know I wanted to start brewing beer their excitement level grew. They walked me though every aspect of brewing the brew kit I wanted to do (Hop Nog 2010) and even talked me out of going glass.  I posted about my first brewing experience here and will update as the process continues. http://bit.ly/eN44JU

this is a great museum. the temperature is always 72 degrees which is key in phoenix in the summer. the art selection is very good as well. i agree with other reviewers that the layout can be somewhat confusing. they could work on a better sense of flow through the building.

Service is suspect but hang in there its worth the wait. Had the Moo Daeng and daeng it was tasty! Started with the Goyosa potstickers and a thai iced tea. Got there at 7:45 and there was another rush of folks around 8:15, crazy! on a Tuesday too! Maybe its all the homes in the area getting hail damage insurance to upgrade their homes. We sure took advantage. Great prices too. Eat it up!

Great service, excellent food, down home setting, and filling everytime.  I suggest the turkey dinner for a win-win situation. Also the prime rib is tasty. The salad bar is well varied and yummy.  If you want fancy this aint your spot. If you want a good filling meal then get some.

I find out that Saturn has stopped making Roof Racks for my 2003 Saturn Vue which means I cannot get a Roof Rack for my Bikes for road trips, bummer deal. Then I remember how hitch racks have gotten really awesome and that I can get a hitch installed. Well who do you go to for a hitch installation? Google results show that Uhaul is the masters of the hitch install and that being that I call Uhaul. This is where the fun begins, and by fun I mean something akin to stabbing my eyes with a pencil.  There is a Uhaul, to my chagrin, very close to my house, so I figure it will be most convenient to call them. After numerous rings I get to talk with Robin. It doesn't sound like Robin is having the best of days, or years, or perhaps longer. I tell her that I would like a hitch installed on my car and we go through the make model year routine to determine what I need installed. She wants to know where I want this done, which is an odd question since I called a specific location. We get through that and she gives me the price of $179.95 for parts, labor, and warranty. She lets me know that it may be more depending on how the wiring configuration is done but I let her know that I will not need that since I am putting a bike rack on and that will be it for the foreseable future. I get a confirmation number and she emails me the receipt. I am also told that someone will contact me to setup the appointment. This is June 10th.  On June 12th, Friday, I still have not received a call so I decide to give the Uhaul location a call back to see whats up with the appointment. I offer my confirmation number but the gentleman just wants my name. He says that the appointment is set up for Wednesday June 17th. I am surprised by this since no one ever called to set that up. I ask if we can get it done on Monday June 15th instead. The gentleman says yes that will be fine and to bring it in at 8am and that it should only take 30 minutes. I enter this into my calendar and go about my weekend.  June 15th rolls around and I go to the Uhaul for my scheduled appointment for the hitch installation. I am greeted by a gentleman walking away from me to talk with another Uhaul employee, or rather Manager/Owner James Flake. After an awkward minute of me standing at the counter 5 feet away from these two gentlemen talking about their work I finally am greeted by the younger one. I let him know that I am here for my scheduled hitch install which causes him to look over my shoulder to James and laugh. He then lets me know that James will be doing the install. I ask if I should bring the car around back and he thinks this is a good plan.  As I pull around I see another customer waiting on James and can see that things are going to be moving slowly today. I wait in my car for 10 minutes until James comes up and asks if I know that this appointment is set for Wednesday. I tell him that yes I am aware that originally it was set for that that but that I had called on Friday to reschedule. He lets me know that its going to take a while as he has deliveries to take care of but that I will be his priority. I am okay with this since I have brought my book along and have no appointments till the afternoon.  10am rolls around and James Flake comes in to let me know its all done. We saddle up to the register and he tells me the total is ~$220 which I inform him is incorrect. I tell him that the total parts, labor, and warranty was quoted to me as $179.95. He snickers at me and wants to know who told me that. I explain that it was Robin to which he responds that Robin does not work there. I let him know that it is irrelevant as I was quoted $179.95 and that is what I will be paying. Another Uhaul employee comes over to see what the fuss is about and they start discussing that I was quoted the online price for the hitch which is cheaper than their price. I stand and say nothing to this.  James is still not willing to offer the price I was quoted so he lets me know that he can take the hitch off. I let him know he is welcome to do so. He then tells me that I will have to wait since he has other customers. This cracks me up because there is nothing better for your other customers than to have one who you are trying to Bait and Switch standing in your store raising hell.  Another Uhaul employee comes over and his name tag says owner as well. By this time I have found the email and let them see it. They agree to honor the price and I am on my way.  Clearly Uhaul has some communication issues between its stores and the central call center that my initial call was routed to. The first issue this caused was that I never got a call back for when the installation would occur. Second when I called to setup the installation time I talked with the store where I was apparently talking to someone too busy to actually write down the appointment that we set up. Third was the price issue.

Medizona My girlfriend and I were out for the afternoon in Scottsdale and had stopped in to SkyBox, at the Mondirain, for a cocktail when Yelp pointed out Medizona as a good dinner option. It was just a few blocks up so we heel-toe expressed it over to our destination, enjoying the pre-nightclub streets of the Dale and a spectacular show of color from the Arizona sunset. The sky oozed romance with reds and yellows flowing overhead guiding us to what was building to be a nice romantic evening out.  Medizona is located inbetween Old Town and Fashion Square Mall on the East side of Scottsdale Road. It is slightly buried in an older office area and the building itself seems to be a pastiche of what used to be multiple office suites repurposed for the culinary experience. The setting is subdued with low lighting and minimal decoration. There is a large room to the right that seems to be more for nightclub action, though we were there too early to see any such action.  We were waited on by a very comforting and professional gentleman who had the air of being the owner or manager. We choose a couple of glasses of Shiraz from Annies Barn and it was suggested we go with the sampler starter which consisted of a Rabbit Fig Baklava, Lamb in and Eggplant Taco, and Grilled Shrimp with Risotto. The Lamb and the Shrimp were tasty though not quite spectacular. I have a feeling that sampling them all together diluted the experience. I would recommend going 2 times and trying them seperatly. I say 2 times because the Rabbit Fig Baklava is not worth its own trip. The sweetness of the Fig here is out of place and conjours the flavor of a Grape Tootsie Roll Pop, which is not a good flavor for a rabbit dish.  For the entrees I chose the Lamb as I am always curious to see another take on a classic dish and my girlfriend went with the Salmon which we were told was going to be a featured dish in the upcoming issue of Gourmet Magazine. Both dishes were very good and I would recommend either to anyone anytime.  My overall take on Medizona is that its a very nice restaurant with a different take on things - crossing Mediteranian with Southwestern dishes - and I would recommend it for both romantic and small group dinners. The themes create a unique and memoriable experience without being too overdone or cliche.

On Sunday and Monday they have a Raw menu and I highly suggest you give it a try. The prices are a tad higher but the resulting flavors are awesome. Check out the dehydrated crackers and cinnamon rolls!  The owners are really friendly and helpful as well.

Found this place because it is close to Changing Hands Bookstore where Gary Vaynerchuk is speaking next monday Oct 26 2009 and I want to bring a group to yoga first. This is the closest place.  I dont do a lot of Bikram but do enjoy it every so often and the studio setup at BYT is really good. The heating system in the room is setup so that you get consistent temperature the whole class. The teachers are all top notch especially Reba and they do a really awesome deal for $25 if you are new where you get 2 weeks unlimited for free.

Espressos and cocktails. For the win how about that? Jeff is a gentleman and a scholar and has created something that Phoenix needs more of: a stylish place for hanging out and being creative. There is a hipster vibe but it's not clicky. Be comfortable with who you are and be ready to interact with other people and you will have a great time here. Wifi is good and if it seems slow try one of the other two access points. I hope to one day get the password to the internal network. Rumor has it that Jeff knows the google fibre guys and is secretly testing it out for the Phoenix area.   Finally if you see a hairy guy having a blast with his wife and the bartender buy him a drink. It's the desert by the way. Hydration is important.

drip is a very apt name for this place. its got the heart but the actual follow through and execution leave a lot to be desired. my first cappuchino was horribly burnt and undrinkable. i sent it back and the owner made me another. it was equally as bad but i didnt want to make a scene out of it and drank my girlfriends iced tea, after we had to ask for the ice part. the breakfast was decent but nothing to get me out of bed to come and have. i am giving it two stars because they were playing the portishead live album and that gets my heart strings everytime.  i know it seems harsh to judge a place on one experience but if i am going to spend money at an establishment they better make it the best experience everytime i am there. i gave drip a chance by sending my first coffee back and it came back to me just as ruined. this is not a case of accident, this is a case of not knowing how to make espresso. this is actually very common at most restaurants unfortunately no one seems to either complain about it or know when their espresso has been burned. (ie - its not supposed to taste bitter and make your face scrunch up in pain).  for a coffee shop this is just unexcusable and grants no second chances. i hope that the owner is reading this cause i do want to see them succeed and i hope that she sees this as constructive criticism.  in the meantime i have been introduced to LUX who have made me 3 caps on 3 seperate trips and each one has been perfect.

super chill atmosphere with nice rolling door to open it all up to outside, perfect for fall to spring in phoenix! coffee is top notch and bagels are huge, baked not boiled so deal. lunch is great the curry chicken sammy is a delight and ice tea gets free all day refils. this is my new office away from office. and to the guy that likes to put his shoes on the couch: please stop, its pretty lame.

Set in a very unassuming building is this treasure of a restaurant. The first time I visited about 8 months ago I got a bit tipsy on the sangria, so go easy with that stuff. The problem was that it made me forget what I had eaten.  This time I was much better about the sangria consumption, just one glass. We did three dishes between the two of us, the Tortilla, the Spinach with Garbonzo beans, and the special that night of Eggplant layers.  The Tortilla is like a Quiche of Egg with Potato and is okay. The Eggplant was very good, but the winner of all was the Spinach and Garbonzo beans.  I have just recently in the last 4 months gone vegetarian/vegan and am saddened at times by the removal of Pork from my diet. When I started in on this dish I was concerned that I was violating my culinary discipline because the taste of Pork fat was very prevalent. Upon talking with one of the wait staff I learned that the magic ingredient was Smoked Paprika. Absolutely delicious!  There were some people complaining about the noise which is hilarious to me. Guess what its a Tapas bar, its supposed to be noisy and boisterous. Go to Lola's if you are ready for some conversation and good food!

Found Bunna doing a fast search for coffee in Tempe and the reviews all seemed nice enough that it just made sense to give them a shot. Located in a non descript strip mall, like everything else in phoenix, Bunna is a super chill atmosphere with lots of tables and free Wifi for hanging out and getting stuff done.  The Wifi speed is just over 1Mbps when i tested it, not awesome but not bad either.

beers are so so. it has been hit or miss in my experience. some batches are tasty, others are awful.  the food is pretty much terrible here, even for bar food. i would recommend zipps over this fare anyday.  the ambiance is great and the glasses are nice, but i can go to disacca down the road for that, and take the glasses home!

i am working in north scottsdale again and wanted to find a nearby yoga spot to stay in shape and try to heal my knee at. i found sumits and while i am not a fan of heated it can be good for toning up a bit. the first two microphone blaring instructors were tolerable the third one (David) was an outright jerk/ass.  i get there tonight at 5:30 and start signing in and right away start getting harassed by this guy: "are you new?" he asks.  "31 years new i guess." is my reply.  (blank stare) he gives back. "are you new?" he asks again.  "to yoga, or this studio?" I ask back.  (stares at me) he replies.  so i smile and offer my hand "i am roger" i say and he goes for the death grip  "david" he replies. "we are gonna get started here soon"  "well i hope i dont ruin everything being a few minutes late" i reply.  "its just rude to show up to yoga late" he snaps back.  wow! what a professional attitude to take with someone who is trying out a studio that you are a substitute at. what a yogic attitude to take with someone who is going to be your student for 70 minutes for the first time. peace be with you my friend.  this is unreal to me and seems very opposite to what yoga is. however i guess the microphone should have given it away. this is not yoga. this is an aerobics class masquerading as yoga. and the combative attitude that David showed me today is typical of a GYM not a yoga studio.  so i left. i may go back a few more times cause i have a week left on the intro program that i am doing for $20, but after that this place wont see another dime from me.  oh and i love how up till the two negative reviews showed up today the only other review was from the owner himself.  try yoga village across the 101 or head to chandler and tempe for innervision or phoenix for gravity center yoga. all of which i have reviewed before.

"Best Coffee I have ever had." This was the remark from a friend whom I took to Cartel for the first time today.  The place has attitude and is willing to call a customer out. Something I would love to do more than I can. If you want Caramel, or Vanilla, or a Milk Shake, or a Burrito, or Cotton Candy you need to go somewhere else. This is a Coffee shop.  They roast their own beans so they are fresh and tasty.

just found aromas last night, really good stuff all and all and helpful staff was great. the only reason i cant go 5 stars is because of the setting and the plate presentation. if they made it a little more comfortable and presented their dishes to be a little more pleasing to the eye i would go 5.

Went for lunch with a coworker. The food is good and relatively inexpensive. I had the eggplant with basil and was happy.  Decor is pleasant but I am unsure why they use up 30% of their space for a deli style counter when its all wait served.  Another gripe is with price and vegetarian spots in general. Usually meat is the most expensive item in a dish. If there is no meat then the restaurants costs are lower (not to mention storage and handling savings) so this should be passed on to the consumer. If they offered a $5 lunch menu they would clean up.   Overall I recommend this since it is healthy and quick.

Maizie's Cafe & Bistro My girlfriend had just finished auditioning for the Phoenix Choir so I wanted to treat her to a meal. We like to try new things and especially local venues and since we go to Lux occasionally had noticed a few new spots just north of there. One of them is Maizie's Cafe & Bistro.  I should have gotten a sense that something was strange with this place when I called to make sure they were open. The woman on the other end seemed taken aback by this simple question. I then asked if they were any good and once again there was a hesitation.  We arrived at around 645 to a fairly packed restaurant which is always a good sign especially on a Monday night, right? However i was immediately surprised to see Three big screen televisions on each wall save the back one, presumably because this had a wine rack on it... I dont know about you but when a room that is at best 20' X 20' has three 42 inch TV's in it I call that a Sports Bar, and they had American Football on one and what the rest of the world call Football on the other. To offset this they did have the third TV set to the Food Network.  Our table was somewhat sticky and when our drinks arrived the coaster for the tea got stuck to the table and eventually peeled away. Troubling but I wanted to keep positive since this was a celebration. We ordered wine and a cheese plate and almost immediately were approached by another waitress wondering if we were ready to order. Very confusing.  The cheese plate was straight out of Home Economics. They could have gone to Safeway and put a better selection of cheeses together. I would go easier on them except that the ambience and prices are asking for the quality to be better than presented.  My girlfriend ordered the Tuna Salad and I got the Fresh Basil Pasta with Marinara. Now I know that one of the hip things to do is have eclectic dinnerware to set your restaurant apart from the rest but serving salads in mixing bowls that dont match the decor is very awkward. Throwing a few veggies in said bowl and then a heaping scoop of tuna mix is not an entree, its a lunch item. Same goes with the Marinara dish. This cacophony of salad items sauteed up and mixed with pasta and a decent Marinara sauce is once again lunch fare, not a $12 dinner entree.  Throughout the course of this dinner we had both waitresses coming up to us about every 5 minutes to make sure everything was okay. A little hint to good serving: if someone is in the middle of a sentence dont ask if everything is okay. This became very annoying and when I mentioned it to my party we were approached once again, as if they were trying to push the point.  Another feature of Maize's is that it has Free Wifi and posts this fact on its doorway. So we are also trying to be a Coffee Shop/Internet Cafe. So to add to the glow of Plasma screens all around a group of students sit next to our table and launch up three laptops, very romantic indeed.  The piece de resistance thought was when the florescent lighting from the outside awning kicked in halfway through the entrees and we were bathed in a brilliant glow of blandness. At this point we both broke down into laughter at the whole spectacle. The effect was a perfect way to end this experience.  Overall Maize's is a horribly confused concept with incredibly schitzophrenic tendencies. It wants to be everything to everyone. The look says it wants to be a wine bar, but the TV's confuse that aspect. The menu talks gourmet but the reality is that they are serving lunch fare, which has its place. The free wifi means you will be getting non diners which will only make the diners more uncomfortable. I get a sense of what they are trying to do which is a Cafe/Bistro, but in order to do that you need to scale down the ultra modern look of the place. From the outside it says dinner but the reality is that its a hangout.  To its credit it was close to full on a Monday evening so there seems to be some appeal.

Thai House My new iPhone is becoming a great tool for finding new places to eat. The combination of being location aware with GPS and the Yelp Application mean that I can find places to eat nearby very quickly. Last night this happened when I was leaving work and needed to get a bite to eat before heading home. So I brought up Yelp and hit Restaurants and Filtered them down to within 1 mile of my current location, having a maximum of $$ for price, and being open(a critical factor often overlooked with most online restaurant finders). the result was an Ice Cream Shop and Thai House. Being 31 I opted for Thai over Treat.  Thai House is located in the Sonora Village shopping center just south of Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd and west of the 101. Its near Rays Pizza and just north of Best Buy. The setting is straight forward diner style with tables and three booths. One nice touch is the mirrored walls on each side of the dining room making it seem three times larger and lightening everything up.  I ordered the Rad Nah and some hot Green Tea. I was served in less than 5 minutes to a steaming bowl of Tofu, Broccoli, and Noodles in a delicious broth. I had asked for Medium spice and that was good but still burned my throat a bit. the dish was delicious but a bit warm. I suggest letting it sit for a few minutes, or eat with someone else and share your dishes. This will help to cool the items and give you the opportunity to connect.  Overall I recommend the Thai House for a nice quick meal. They are Vegetarian Friendly and will substitute Tofu for any of the meats.

If you like good food, nice people, and really good food then you have to goto DD's. I heart Double D's too and you will once you eat here. I had the Caprese with Salami and Orzo salad with a Dad's Orange Soda. Perfect.  They gots tons of salads and take home dishes. One huge cheese case and another for the desserts. They also have spices, wine, and beers. The best beers are the ones in the cans BTW  Apparently they will be opening a kiosk at the airport in a bit with some other local restaurants. Good food at the airport.

This is the place to go for some good tasty Mexican food. The staff is always happy to talk about the various items on the menu and makes great suggestions. We had the Ceviche, Vampiro, and Two Tacos and tried both Margaritas. I would no suggest the Jamaican Margarita but some people like it.

Kathryn, my girlfriend, loves True Food kitchen and I am a skeptic of anything done by the FOX group especially when it aligns itself to a single philophers idea of eating well, in this case Dr. Weil. I am also a pretty critical person and enjoy critiquing most everything especially eatieries and restaurants.  One issue we have is that we are Vegans and while they do have a number of items listed as Vegan on the menu there are a few things that just seem silly. The first one is that they have no Salads listed as Vegan and the second is that they do not offer Vegan Mayo. The last time we mentioned the Mayo thing our server gave us a reason why they didnt but that we are welcome to bring our own in.  Today has been a fun day so I thought going to True Food would be a good treat for Kathryn and maybe distract me from other events occuring recently. Our server, Chris, has waited on us before and is always very nice. When we mentioned the Soy Mayo thing she offered to go talk to the chef and managers. When she returned the reply was that "at some point we have to draw the line." To which I explained that by offering Vegan/Soy Mayo they would lower costs, increase shelf life, and even start substituting it with real Mayo without anyone noticing. She thought these were valid enough and again went to talk with the chef and managers. To which Kathryn and I exchanged glances and began eating our soup.  To our surprise our next visitor was none other than Michael Stebner the Executive Chef of the restaurant. We began a 10 minute conversation about their philosophy and methodology for creating the menu. He explained that they are not a health food restaurant but rather a restaurant with a health focus. He also pointed out that they are happy to modify anything on the menu to accomodate a number of eating requirements. This was really cool stuff.  He then went further and talked about his history as a chef and what he has seen work and not work from a practical perspective. This was a real conversation and I appreciate his engagement with us both. At no time was he demeaning to us and he never brushed a point of ours off. While I disagree with the philosophy of their menu I respect their methodology and see that they are interested in doing something more than just sell as much food as possible.  Overall this was a great experience and while it did not result in everything I wanted I am more than happy to refer anyone to eat here and will be back again!

The Trailhead Bike Shop and Cafe is a new bike shop and cafe born from the efforts of local Kiel Marley. The concept is pretty simple: have bike shop add cafe and let the results happen. The execution is going well so far. The location is on 16th St and Glendale in the Basha's shopping center on the SE corner, so its easy to find and get to. It also sits right on the canal route that is paved from the Biltmore to 75th Ave so you can stop in while cruising all over town.  When you immediately walk into the shop you are in the bike shop part of things. Its a pretty traditional setup of new bikes all lined up and shiny. They seem to be a Felt shop which is cool. If you need a new bike this is a good place to go.  The food is simple and good. Pastries are coming from a local bakery and are very good. They make the Quiche in-house and it was very filling. I also had a Latte and Kathryn had a Hot Chocolate which went down well on a chilly December morning ride.  Overall I will be back to the Bike Cafe and recommend that you stop by soon!

Very cozy spot to hang out at and enjoy your coffee. Friendly staff and reasonable prices. Lots of shaded outdoor seating. Free wifi and some indoor seating if you need to work on the laptop.   Since it's a coffee shop I don't expect them to have a huge variety of food options. However it would be nice if they added hummus as an option for the bagels. Not only would this be vegan but a nice hearty and healthy option to cream cheese.

Found Hegel while I was searching for places to have the initial Yoganite.com event. I wanted something central and near a good after party spot to hang out at. Hegel came up on Yelp in Tempe and I gave them a call to see if it would be okay to bring a group for yoganite.com. Tish called me back a little while later and was happy to have us and felt it would be a good time.  To test them out I went to a regular Ashtanga class on Saturday morning and Tish kicked my but. I practice yoga often and a good Ashtanga class always works me into a dripping mess of bliss. Tish is a really strong teacher and knows her stuff.  For Yoganite.com's first event I wanted a pretty easy class so that beginners would feel comfortable. The turnout was great and even had a few folks show up that I had never met before. Tish was awesome and very helpful with the beginners.  I would recommend anyone to Hegel Yoga. The studio is very simple and comfortable, and its right next to four peaks brewery!

Great place with good trainers. I spent 3 months using this gym as a preparation for a 300 mile bike ride down the coast of california. I had a great time and definitely got in great shape for the ride. If I lived closer I would probably still be going there.

Went to Loving hut with my GF for a Vegetarian Society Meet Up.  Food is pretty simple but good and service is fast. If you are in the west valley this is your spot. if you are not in the West Valley check out Vegetarian house for a similar setup.  We got the steak sandwich which was not bad, but nothing to write home about either.  The Supreme Master TV stuff is funny and entertaining.

Excellent Trailhead into the Superstition Wildernesss if you want to get away from people quickly. After 3 miles we saw no other people until the next morning, 9 miles away.  Showers at the marina public restroom are not the highest quality, but after a few days in the wilderness it was like a spa. March to Mid-April and October to November are most recommended for having water sources available.

Great Service, Excellent Food, Good Beer, Great Coffee, and its falling distance from where I live. Its hard not to just love the hell out of this place so I don't.  Walked in for lunch and was greeted warmly and quickly. Asked for recommendations and the Tacos came my way with Chips and Guacamole. The beer was deliciousness and I see that Cartel provides the coffee.

This place is just plain great. If you want fancy its not gonna work out. If you want service to kiss your butt it aint gonna work out.  If you want great food then its gonna be a ok.  Have tried many versions of the Pho and all are great. The spring rolls are a delight, and the coconuts are a treat.  Its Pho-tastic!  Only complaint is that they close too early. If this was open till 2am on the weekends I would be there every Friday!

Really cool place. Great music. Free wifi. Tasty coffee. Vegan soup and beers on tap. Great service. Local company.  Apparently Yelp feels this review is shorter than most so I will add more words to appease the Yelp gods into thinking this is enough content. Now they are happy

They got me in and out before I even knew I was there. The technicians were very expedient, helpful, and personable. They got me through all the test in record time. The techs and the doctor were also very knowledgable about my insurance and how to best utilize it.  Their selection in frames is also pretty impressive and I found a stylish pair that I am happy with.  I would recommend them to anyone and everyone.

walking distance from my home = good stuff inexpensive good food  = happy tummy with no regrets multiple healthy options  = leaner roger with no regrets  from the outside rigatony's is suspect, heck even once you get inside it looks suspect but the service and food is solid. i generally get pasta and either marinara or pesto sauce. always comes with a salad and bread. everything else i have had there is delish too but heavy and i am trying to stay lean.  pass on the wine, its just too cheap to be drunk.

Krav maga  Got a coworker who has been doing the Krav Maga stuff for a few months and he is always talking about it so I had to try it out. There are 4 locations inthe PHX valley and two are pretty close to home. I have read about Krav Maga a few times and of course heard about how it the method of choice for the Israeli Defense Forces because its about brute force used to defeat opponent quickly and allow for escape.  The gym is pretty straight forward, mirror at one end and a firm but padded floor. The class before mine was a 'Bag' class meaning they were not doing Krav Maga but were instead doing physical exercises with hitting bags. It was an intense mess of running around punching, lying down, getting up, and all sorts of craziness.  The health sogn off form and waiver were pretty extensive and pretty much cut me off from suing them if I got injured in the gym at all. Hey I am going there to learn to defend myself I better keep my head up. Manni was the guy running the counter and I found out later is one of the top instructors there. The nice thing was that I didnt even think he was a trainer at all till they said something. Super nice guy and laid back which is a nice change from the majority of trainers that I know at other gyms.  Class started off and Lisa was leading it. She took care to address me as the new guy to make sure I understood what was going on at all times. This was done in a very respectable way so that I felt priveledged to get the attention and not talked down upon which I feel at a lot of places, even yoga studios. This was all about respect and no nonsense.  We went straight into warm up with jumping jacks, then high knees, then heel kicks, and quick feet (all of which I am pretty sure I hadnt done in over 12 years). Got the heart racing big time. Then it was into sholder taps with random partners throughout the gym. This was a great method of snapping your head into hitting and being hit though it was light and on the shoulders. Then is was partnered situps and pushups. Having a partner made you push yourself and then push them to go faster and harder. We finished off with some Bear Runs and more pushups and then back to some steps.  A short break and we were right into hand heel strikes with a partner and hitting pad. I have never been a fighter and never really trained on how to hit. After a quick demonstration from Lisa it was straight into going at it and I have to tell you I got right into it. I put all the bad calls and frustrations from the day into that pad and took it out on it. The cool thing is that you get just as much a workout when you are holding the pad. I learned quickly to breath out when they are hitting the pad to help absorb the blow.  Next up was low kicks and then Knees with a hold. Once again the instruction was precise, quick, and easy to pick up. They contextualized it with real world situations so that you could vizualize why and how you would use the technique. Once the threat is realized you become aggresive and you put everything you can into it until the threat is over. I particularly enjoyed the Knee with Hold technique. I hope my partner's neck is okay today cause I was throwing him around a bit.  Then we started working on arm grabs and how to react to that. Basically if a stranger grabs you then you immediately punch them in the face until they let go. Obviously you want to use some level of common sense and not punch a cop or someone trying to help you. You stand still with eyes closed and whatever way they pull you use the opposite hand to go at them and hard. The partner brings their other hand up in front of their face to act as a target, if they forget to you need to remember to pull the punch. No hitting in the face in class - a fair rule.  The next drill involved a group of three where the third person is holding one of your arms back while you remain focused on hitting the other who is holding a pad. This is the most exhasting drill and almost lead to me spitting up my lunch a few times.  By the end I was a sweaty mess and more relaxed than I have been in a while. All aggression and frustration was gone. So I signed up for a year.

At 34 years of age I decided to learn how to play a music instrument. After searching the valley for a teacher I found Phoenix Music Lessons(PML). I started off by going to their offices and learning from Aric who is a great teacher and I progressed very well but after a few months I decided that being able to learn and practice at my house was what would work best. Aric said that was not a problem and that is when Erica started teaching me piano. She is a really great teacher and has helped me progress very well. She is a master of the piano and realyl knows how to teach you how to play. I highly recommend Phoenix Music Lessons and Aric and Erica as teachers.

Cannot say enough about this place. The Food is delicious and all dairy free. The staff is really nice and helpful. Did i mention that the food is delicous? Sunday brunch is a treat and they seem to be super busy. Go support local vegan business.

Had dinner with the wife last Thursday and wanted to try the new vegan spot in town. Very exciting that we now have 3 vegan restaurants within 10 miles of our house in Phoenix. Tediberto's seems like its still getting its feet at this point. We enjoyed ourselves and will return. Hopefully they refine things a bit more.  Food: 5 Stars. Very tasty stuff for sure. Perhaps a bit over dependent on Soyrizo which makes things super spicy. The table next to us was melting under the heat of their dish and that was just a regular order. So we asked things to be as mild as possible and it could have stood to be even a bit more mild. We had the nachos, the quesadilla and La Borrachita tacos and ate everything on our plates. We finished with the tiramisu. Like I said we ate everything off our plates but the spice was a bit overwhelming.  Setting: 3 stars. Very cool spot with fun lights and art. However the nightclub lighting does not help make the food look good. With the table light coming from under your plates the food its pretty much dark the whole time. I highly suggest getting more regular lighting over the tables to show off the wonderful, but spicy, food.  Service: 5 stars. We had the new server help us and he was a delight. It was his second day but his enthusiasm out shined and made the dining experience that much better.

Omg this is the place to get your soap on. You can feel the joy that Tracey puts into everything that happens at this shop. Besides just buying her stuff, which you should do (did you know there is a soap of the month club? You should join it. All the cool kids are going it. Don't you want to be cool?), she also hosts workshops on how to use her products and make your own.   What kind of business owner teaches people to make her products? A mad genius who is gonna save the planet one bar of soap at a time, that's who.   Seriously though you should check this place out. The products are amazing and it's a local business so you get double bonus cool factor points for shopping here.
