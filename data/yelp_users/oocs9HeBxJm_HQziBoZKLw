Its hard to find good places to eat and/or party in this area...Please steer clear of this one.  We've went there before with about 5 minutes before opening, and they would not let us in and chill with a drink.  Guess you don't want money?  Additionally, the food is far from authentic or properly prepared.  Fun story.  We sat at the bar once just to have some saki-bombs, there was a fancy bottle of whiskey displayed that I thought I would try...Why not?  It was my birthday and I wasn't driving.  He poured what was left of the almost empty bottle for me in a shot glass...It was dish water/swill that the owners had put in the bottle over time to dilute it and reduce having to buy another bottle.  (Since rarely would people purchase expensive whiskey)  I almost puked.  They realized that I noticed and replaced it immediately with beat red faces.  LOLZ.    Drive further (out of Tolleson) for better Sushi/tempan.

PLEASE clean up your parking lot.  I was approached by 3 different people for money on my way to the car.  A crackhead with the "out of gas" story, a funeral of which seems to be needing funding every week, and children selling old candy.  Customers shouldn't feel unsafe and anxiety when putting their groceries in their cars.  Do something about it.

Thank you guys for being courteous and helpful...not to mention fast and precise.  I always have a good experience here.  Different stylists each time, but it has worked out great.  Appreciate it!

Used to love this place...cool environment.  But, the staff of amber crombie frat boys are beyond terrible. Never have I ever been treated so poorly downtown than I have here. Worst moment: valet guys tried to pick a fight with me and flicked me off as I was leaving...I did nothing to provoke. Advice: get staff with customer service skills not a bunch of pompous frat boys.

Om Ink Gallery and the artists/owner there have been the most professional, courteous, talented group of artists I've had the pleasure to work with.  I've been going to Duane and Taija for over 6 years now...This is due to a great first impression...no big ego's, no uncomfortable exchanges...Just great ideas, thoughts and art.  (That is how you run a business)    I appreciate them and tell ANYONE I know to visit the shop to brainstorm ideas for great tattoos.  I have work from both Duane and Taija, and the line work, colors, and durability over time is noticed....Thanks guys!
