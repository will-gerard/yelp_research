My favorite Indian food in Phoenix. The menu is huge, the takeout is quick and always fresh.  The only Indian restaurant that does "Indian spicy" correctly.   It is a little quiet, and could do with more ambience, but the quality of the food more than makes up for it.

I am here at least 2-3 times a week.  The staff is amazing, the draft beers are always fun and often obscure, and only $2.50 during happy hour.  The food is excellent.  And, they play a great selection of old school hip hop.

For the number of staff at this Starbucks, I am at a complete loss how it takes so long to get coffee. I regularly have to wait a few minutes before a cashier takes my order, and they have given me the wrong size or blend of coffee on multiple occasions.  The drive-thru is typically 5-10 cars deep, and it takes an inordinately long time compared to other Starbucks .  I'm not sure if there are staffing problems or are just disorganized.  Great location, but disappointing service.
