Sooo delicious! Definitely a place for a great lunch  - soup and an egg roll is included which is a PLUS! Their fried tofu is to die for, I just wish they would add more to the dishes. However, definitely worth to stop in!

Ordered delivery here last night - the delivery was fast and hot which was a plus! However, the only good thing out of my whole order was the crab angels. My fried shrimp was super dry and unflavored and my boyfriend's orange chicken was dry, dry, DRY. Such a shame because they are super nice, fast delivery and good pricing. Might give this place a try again but not in the near future.

So delicious!!!! I've had the pizza, salad, and pasta and have never been disappointed.  Super fast service and I have never, ever had a bad time here. Plus if you're looking for authentic olive oils, cheeses, sauces, and balsamic vinegars this is also the place for you.

Yes, yes, yes!!!!!! Looking for an Asian inspired cuisine? This is THE place!!! I love how any option can be made vegetarian and their tofu is out of this world. My boyfriend and I absolutely love this place and I refused to eat at any other Asian style unless it's Tott's! Try the Hawaiian style tofu and vegetables you will not be sorry!!!

First off the service here is amazing! The two waitresses were so nice to the group of us when we went there on our lunch break and there service was excellent. The food came out fast and was SO delicious. Plus the whole vibe of the place is chill and modern, definitely a place I'll be visiting more. The fresh basil on my margarita pizza was the topping to an excellent lunch. Thanks Gelato Spot for an awesome and fast lunch experience!

I usually love Wendy's but i have had an encounter with the manager and he was straight up rude. And today I went around 950 am to get some food and according to their website Wendy's open at 7 am and I sat in the drive thru for 5 min and no one said that they were closed or asked me if I want anything. There was 4 cars parked out front so I am sure there were people in side. Now i called later in the day to get clarification on when they open, and the phone rang for 2 min... At 130 in the afternoon. I am very disappointed.

Love, love, love this place! Super cheap rolls but totally delicious. I do wish they had a larger menu but there is no place that beats these prices. I highly suggest spicy crab, asparagus and Las Vegas rolls. It can be definitely addicted and it doesn't break the bank!

Soooooooooo GOOD! Plus the happy hour is the best! If you go - I highly recommend the Philly roll and the Las Vegas roll. This is a place you crave afterwards and can't wait for the next time I will be eating there.

Just in Time Moving is FANTASTIC! They showed up on time and hustled! They were done moving early and even helped me with other items that I had. They are cheaper than any other movers and the guys were super nice. I will use them again when I have to move. Awesome job! I highly recommend anyone use them over anyone else!

Definitely the best place I have been to this far from grooming. My dog is an Australian cattle dog mix and she sheds so much. They shaved her down so nicely and now she is much cooler. Thank you so much for the wonderful groom on Emma, I will be back for sure!

Amazing service! My nail technician was very friendly and nice. Plus they have an array of great colors to choose from. She took her time and really made it her mission to make my nails perfect. She shaped and cleaned up my nails and took her time with the gel. I will definitely be going back and might make this my new favorite spot. I highly suggest making an appointment or going earlier in the week, they can get very busy.

SO DELICIOUS! I suggest the tuna sandwich on sourdough. It was so fresh and flavorful that sometimes I dream about it. This place is very modern and stylish but with a nice twist on Mediterranean food. I can't wait to try more on the menu, this might become my weekly go-to place!

Love this place! I stop by almost every morning before work to grab an iced kicker with almond milk :) I am so happy a coffee place offers almond, coconut, and soy milk. Definitely a bonus when you can't have dairy! The staff is always super friendly and I love that no matter how long the line is their service is quick and always tastes amazing!

I waited one month before I wrote this review and my gel mani is still going strong! This place was super awesome and the woman doing my nails was very nice. Instead of doing a color that would be too streaky, she told me up front and offered another color which was close. I loved that they were honest about the color selection and was focused on providing me an awesome gel mani. Definitely recommend but make an appointment first!

So delicious! The beet salad with tofu, quinoa, sweet potatoes and kale salad and any of the juices are to die for! I just wish the place was a little cheaper. I suggest the slim squeeze with a beet and tofu salad, makes you crave it for days.

Janette is SUPER sweet! I was nervous to go to a salon and have a stranger cut my hair. I showed her a picture of how I wanted my hair cut and she did exactly that. She definitely makes you feel comfortable the minute you  walk in. She is worth the wait too. Janette gets booked up pretty fast but I highly suggest her for anyone that is looking for an awesome hairdresser. She also worked so well with my busy schedule and made sure I could get in for a haircut. I am also going to try her dry shampoo recommendations! I can't wait to go back :)

First time eating here and it was delicious! My boyfriend and I were excited to learn about the excellent pricing and unlimited toppings! We ordered and picked it up within 15 minutes. Another bonus is how fast the service was. Not only was the pizza delicious but it was easy and quick to get it ordered. We will definitely be trying other pizza combinations in the future. Great job Fired Pizza!

One if the best gel nail places in Tempe! They last forever and the color stays bright. I will never go to anywhere else. I highly, highly, highly recommend this nail salon for anyone who wants a good gel manicure that doesn't break the bank!

Fantastic salon!!!! I bought the Groupon in desperate need of a haircut and some sort of style to my long hair. Jen was amazing and cut my hair EXACTLY like the picture I showed her. She was super nice and worked fast!  I will definitely be coming back for another haircut :)

This was my first time ever trying this place but it took 2 hours to deliver to my house. When I called to ask where my order was, the woman on the phone told me the driver should be arriving soon. It took another 30 minutes until he arrived. By this time, we were starving. As we removed our food from the bag it was ice cold. The fries were soggy and not even a hint of warmth, our burgers were ice cold as well. I called back and the manager on duty place me on hold for a while and then asked if I wanted him to remake the food. Honestly, I told him I didn't want to wait another 2 hours for food. He offered to credit back my account which was pretty cool of him but I have yet to see the credit applied. I don't think I will give this place another try due to the disgustingly cold food.

Soooooo delicious. Everything on the menu is prepared in such a beautiful way and each roll is fresh. You can't go wrong here, it is a tad expensive but totally worth the price. I highly suggest the Samurai and Las Vegas. The service is a bit slow when they are really busy but besides that, definitely a delicious place for good sushi.

Secure Real Estate is the best in town! Charlotte is by far my favorite. Her knowledge of available homes, pricing and locations were exactly what I needed in order to find the perfect place. I needed advice and her willingness to help made my whole home buying experience better. If you are looking for a home in the Scottsdale/Chandler area, Secure Real Estate is the best!

BEST PLACE FOR SPINNING. Tuesday at 5:30 with Jessica is my favorite part of my day.  It's totally affordable and the staff is so nice. I take everyone who is interested in cycling here. Don't hesitate. It's totally worth it.

Omg! Best Asian Vegan food I've had! I highly suggest the veggie pot stickers and the orange tofu. Out of this world delicious. Plus the servings are nicely portion so you can get a few dishes and share with friends. I suggest getting there before the dimmer rush, the place is small and can fill up fast.

Sooooo delicious! I've had the Mad Caesar, Health Nut, and the Hummus Trio Plate. All of it is AHMAZING! I always get the tofu and medium dressing for my salads. You can also substitute and add whatever you like. They also offer fresh juices, I highly suggest the Mint Cooler over ice. Definitely a nice place to eat out but healthy too! Lots of options for any kind of diet.
