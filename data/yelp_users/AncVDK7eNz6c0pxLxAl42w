Im not sure what the hell people are smoking before they come here to give this place anything more than a 0 star... I literally hated this place. I usually go to the one in Tempe, which is very nice.. Okay so this place blows... the staff is running around like animals not tending the guest and its just chaotic... so we start and the lane isnt work, its not starting the balls dont come back when we throw them and the gates are randomly coming down before we throw the ball, or before the ball hits the pins? WTF? The food is expensive... as expected since the others are.. but seriously we paid for unlimited bowling for 2 hours and stayed for like one hour. Also all the balls... well unless you have little kids thumbs, or giant hands, they wont fit the balls.. which in my opinion is like the # 1 thing when bowling... having a ball that fits... oh well. The lanes are oiled to hell and you feel like youll slip every time you go down to bowl.. thats awesome.. pay 15.00 to fit my fingers into smaller holes, break my neck while bowling, have the ball get blocked by a gate, and not get served? wow.. i know ill never go back to this one at least.

My chicken was so plain. I was upset with it. It was just teriyaki chicken. Hard to mess up. I doubt ill be back. It is a relaxing place tho. Just dont go for the food.

This place is so awful.... I walk in with a Droid 2 Global I had just gotten in the mail because my last 3 messed up.. This one as well did the same... It wasnt making calls 100% the time like it should... So i go in and tell the salesmen what was wrong with the phone... he looks at it and says... OHHHH I SEEE... there is lent in the head speaker... REALLLY!? LENT!? come on dude... then i said i doubt thats it... he comes back to say its a combo of the lent and holding the phone cock eyed... OMFG. I was raging pissed off. But he made a call and it worked (this time) so I couldnt say anything.. Later that night it does it again... But really for them to even say that was whats wrong? wow.

If you want to get away from the standard burger from chains, this is your place. Fries are crispy with good seasoning. Burger I got was the country. Upon the first bite I was actually not impressed, maybe because my mouth didn't know wtf I was doing steering away from the usual quick nasty bullshit. I then dived in more and found its actually quite delicious. Prices is same roughly as a McDonald's or whatever. They actually cook their meat, that actually taste like meat, that's a nice change. Overall good and whatever. If you know Spanish ordering is a simple task, but they know English too so don't worry. Enjoy!!

Okay so based on the food... Nope. The service was awesome.. I walked in around 1 or so and the workers jumped up. Im pretty simple and asked what their best sandwich was. It was a Georgetown they said. Alright good enough for me. Then I got the sandwich and started looking at it... well it was so skimpy on the meat I was confused as hell.. It looked like 1-2 oz of meat.. Literally one piece of turkey and 2 pieces of bacon.. I understand it was a small.. But still for 6 bucks i think it should fill me up. It was more bread than meat.. I worked at a few sandwich places before and all load em up better than here.. I recommend Firehouse Subs. May pay a $1 more or so, but when you get 4x the meat its so much more worth it.

Ive been twice now and my first time was better than my second. I got the same nice nurse to poke me so that was good.. I think it was Rebecca? not sure. All the staff jokes around and has fun so thats good, makes you feel more relaxed.. I take a long time to donate for some reason... around 1 hr 15 mins, so i enjoy the movies when im there making some extra money and saving lives!

Certain place on the patios you literally cant here yourself talk none the less your friend. The slushies are pretty awesome. (Strawberry and Mango) Get a shot in it for $1 more and it helps you drink it faster :) No cover also which is sweeet. Dance floor is usually pretty empty for some reason. More of a chill bar I guess.

I was loving this place. It has the old feeling type barbershop you see in the movies. The conversations are great and genuine. He did a great job with the haircut too despite me not knowing what I even wanted haha. Give this place a try. I believe it was $17 when I went. Normal price of course. Will be back!!

The walls and the one dolalr bill thing is cool. but when i asked about it they said its a long story and walked away... WHAT? Also i checked in on yelp and got free fries... well was supposed to.. the cashier even marked it as used on my phone then we never got the fries. I order a chicken cheesesteak.. Literally chicken and cheese. Wow even being intoxicated it was bad. My brother also ordered a ROAST beef.. and they have gave him regular beef and cheese.. thats a hell of a difference. This place is literally to sober up at... not enjoy.

Nothing special, but not short of a homie kind of place. I got a regular burger and fries. Im not a huge fan of fries, but these ones were pretty good. The chili burger is the same as the regular burger, same as the fries i believe. Pretty good deal there. Id go back if passing by for sure.

Not really busy ever. But they got karaoke, fun bartenders, and its a cool environment. They got $1 PBR's which is cool cuz anywhere else beer is 3.5-5 a beer. We had stopped in once and then the next day the bartender let us in like we were regulars.. Thats what made me really like this place. PLUS BEER PONG!!!

Ive been twice now and this place is pretty good. Never so busy you waiting forever. So thats a good thing. I have had the chicken and the burgers both now. I definitely like both but their chicken is pretty magnificent. lots of items you can add or subtract from these sandwiches. But it does not come with cheese.. thats a bummer. 50 cents and you can add it thou. They are pretty good on asking if youd like to do it. I also got a milkshake when i went the 1st time and they are quite delicious as well. You can easily spend $10 here, but thats everywhere now days so no sweat. Ill be back.

Okay, so this place is legit. Dance floor is usually/always cleared for the dancers (my brother and I). We do get irish drinks such as smittys, guiness, bombs, and such. The waitresses are very friendly (and not to mention cute). A few things i will say I dont like.. right when you walk in the front door, the bathroom smell is pretty strong with either urine or puke.. Not good.. also on the thurs-saturday I believe they only do plastic cups for guiness and such.. Not good again. This stuff is ment to be drank as a pint sized GLASS! But regardless its one of my top places to go, as well as the other 200 people there.. ahah

Waitress/ bartenders are cute. We didnt eat. We just got a drink and left. Only like 5 beers on tap but no worries. They even gave one of my friends a band-aid lol. Their mix drink prices are a bit outrageous tho.. 3 beers for 10 or so.. 15 alone for a double of jack and coke.

first car wash ever! other than myself cleaning it lol. I do feel like this is a bit unorganized tho.. i just needed a quick wash.. literally the 2.99 one. so thats what i got.. i pulled around but it was like wth? idk i MIGHT be back.  UPDATE: Came back and got the big kahuna. The car looks fantastic now, and smells great. (cherry). I just hope it doesnt rain now. haha but they were much more aware of what was going on and had no problems this time. took roughly 1 hour. but its worth it.

Check in offer WOOT WOOT! got a free margarita for checking in 5 times here, ILL TAKE IT. This is a place nice to go to when finishing up a Firday or Saturday night, its usually pretty calm with a little dance floor if you want to get down. they do do a minimum 10 charge for cards which means your probably paying for someone else or leaving it with them.. meaning you might forget your card there :/

I was thoroughly impressed with this sandwich. The girl behind the counter was awesome in helping us on our first time. Ill be back for something a bit different next time.  EDIT: I have been back three times now. 2nd time was AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but then the 3rd and 4th time was not so good.. little meat, not such a great choice of the sandwich on my part.. I still give it a 4 because the awesome customer service (even with a new guy.) and the amazing sandwich i had the 2 times.

This place as always is delicious.. I reccommend the cake batter for sure. Last time I was in a company was getting some ice cream so it took awhile.. The girl working by herself ( poor thing ) offered to buy me a waffle cone because of the wait.. I declined 1. because it didnt bother me. and 2. I dont like waffle cones lol.. But i swtiched it up and got some strawberry.. pretty good also.. only thing i will say is.. a bit pricey if your looking for  a cheap date!

walk in and BOOM you know your in an authentic Detroit run place. The manager or maybe the owner (im not sure) was ringing people up and you can tell he is definitely from Detroit. They have a cool map of Detroit and some push pins with a sign saying "put it where you come from" I dont think he would of liked it if i asked him to pull out a map of Ohio haha. O-H. but moving on. The place is small but has good seating and pretty good prices. The food itself was AMAZING. I got 2 Detroit Coney Dogs -onion. Simple i know but its easy to mess the chili on it up, and they sure didnt. The guys were awesome who were making the food. Very polite and everyone seemed happy to be there. I live right around the corner and ill absolutely be back. oh and btw they have a 10% check in marked off your bill. I just threw the difference in the tip jar. I consider this to be a nice hidden gem. I hope they expand and get some more recognition.  Thanks guys.

I am currently at store. It's been an hr for a pickup of two pizzas. Only two people are working. One on register one making pizzas. When u have $2 pizzas you expect this to be a busy time. Why only one person? It is only $6 total with 2 pizzas and tax. But holy cow be aware you'll be busy. And this has nothing to do with the food because I haven't even touched it yet.
