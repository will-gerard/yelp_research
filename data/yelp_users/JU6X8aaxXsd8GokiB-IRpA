My last visit at Home Depot. I'm so confused as to why they didn't put me the customer first. This is my second visit to resolve an issue. Instead of providing a solution for me they were rude and unaccommodating. I had to find my own solution. I will be shopping Lowes where me as a customer will be treated fairly and valued.

Been going to Hot Bagels for a long time. Love the food, never had anything bad come from here. Today I tried their burritos the salsa didn't taste home made tasted like it came from a jar. At the very least create a relationship with a filiburtos nearby and get their salsa or make your own.

This place is horrible it is not first come first serve. I've been here for two hours and they've only taken 2 people back. The receptionist should be fired for her ignorance. Do not come here if you need urgent care!

Rating this visit a 1 star. Typically I love Lowes because they go above and beyond to help. Not this time. My faucet is leaking that I bought 7 months ago. They cannot look up my purchase without date of the purchase and part number. I go back to kitchen and bath to ask how to look at my faucet to get a part number and am told I don't know. Super fustrated about this leaking faucet and lack of help. Lowes is always better than Home Depot though. I guess I'm just a bit confused why register my number and name to get e receipts if they can't search for them.

First time being here I just had a bad experience. I won't be back and wouldn't recommend eating here.

My wife and I have had a couple of appointments with Trudy who is one of the counselors here she is great really enjoy her thus far. As far as the office staff goes in my opinion from my experience they are disorganized and insensitive or just don't care about me. There has been three scheduling mishaps within a small time frame. I've was billed for a missed appointment that I did not miss. I spoke with the office manager, he cleared it up the bill and made special arrangements for their mistake by scheduling an appointment after hours only to have the appointment they made special arrangements for cancelled. There was no sympathy from the office staff for my loss of time, or driving down there for multiple times.

Been a while since I've been to an Oregano's. Took my wife since we've both been wanting to come here for a while. To start with the food it was okay. Both my wife I thought the food had a bacon taste which for me was okay, there was no bacon in what I ordered. My wife being pescetarian disliked her food. Service was absolutely horrid. I swear our server forgot about us. No refills, no friendly service. First time here (at this location), last time here. Don't recommend. My server was Jake and he just cost you our business.

Logan and Ann are super helpful. I've been going to pet club for the past few years and every location I go to is always a great experience. Whatever your doing with training and your mission statement is working. Again great service today by Logan he was very informative and offered additional products. Thank you.

Darrell and Brandy are awesome. Always happy to shop at a family owned store and support the local economy. So many things at great prices. I will continue to come here and check them out on Facebook see the latest posts and be the first to grab that awesome item. We've gotten great deals on pet food and supplies, toys for the kids, and home and garden essentials. Also because Fresh Start has a full online store on Amazon I can purchase and have items sent to me and not have to drive. #AreYouGettingAGoodDeal? #FreshStartSaves
