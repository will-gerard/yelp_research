Perfect teeth provides excellent service and is always professional. The girls at the front are super nice and accommodating. I just had my fourth appointment, and feel so confident in my smile! Definitely recommend this office to anyone who is looking for a dentist. You won't be disappointed. :)

Taylor and Tammy sue took great care of us! This was my first time at Oreganos and I will definitely be back, the food was great but the customer service was exceptional. I work in hospitality so it's nice to go out on a Saturday night and receive good service! Very impressed!

Unimpressed with this Starbucks location. I go to Starbucks daily and this particular visit is making me question why I even spend my money here. Maybe I'm just cranky because I just paid 5 dollars for a coffee that was poorly made and NOT what I asked for. I ordered my usual iced caramel macchiato with extra caramel and there was almost no ice, coffee was Luke warm, and the caramel was glopped around the straw. This barista put no effort/love into my coffee and when I asked for extra caramel she snapped back "yeah it says extra caramel" well, I don't know why that would annoy her so much seeing as though she still couldn't follow a simple order. No extra caramel!!! Grrrr...I work in hospitality and never complain and if the barista hadn't given me attitude I would've drank my lukewarm macchiato and went about my day. But here we are...  Sincerely,  A very pissed off Coffee-less regular

My review is based mostly on the excellent service I received from Jenn the bartender...she was absolutely delightful! I came here with my friend (both new to the area) and we had a lot of fun joking around with her. She was both professional and fun...I've been working in the service industry for 5 years...I know great service and I'll definitely be back! We ordered 4 specialty rolls, all of them were delicious...this place was not disappointing in any way. Overall wonderful dining experience, can't go wrong here.

This place gets 5 stars from me. This was my first time ever getting a Brazilian wax and I'm so pleased with the results. Not only do I love the way it turned out but Jessica was awesome and made me feel completely at ease. I was so nervous and thought it was going to be extremely painful. She talked to me the entire time and the pain was tolerable and honestly not that bad. I will definitely be coming here again, this was a wonderful first time experience...the girls at the front were very nice and explained all the packages they offer without being too pushy. Do yourself a favor and book your next appointment at this location with Jessica!

Scheduled an appointment this morning with Stephanie for a haircut and I was so excited they could get me in so quickly! The customer service was wonderful and my hair Stylist- Stephanie, did and amazing job! She made me feel so comfortable about cutting so much of my hair off. I was a little nervous to do such an edgy haircut but she rocked it! I honestly could not be happier with the results, I have gotten so many compliments already! I will definitely be returning to see Stephanie. Do yourself a favor and book an appointment with her ASAP! She also took some before and after photos which I thought was awesome, I forgot to ask her for them so hopefully they will post them on here! Overall one of the best experiences I've had at a salon!

Ashley P. was awesome! Me and my sister were having lunch here on Saturday and she took great care of us, she told us to head over to bottled blonde afterwards! We had a lot of fun!

I just moved here about 3 months ago and after several horrible nail jobs I FINALLY found a place that actually knows what they are doing...They literally "Nailed" it with these coffin shaped nails! I'm so pleased and I will definitely be back, everyone here is so friendly and accommodating! This place is affordable and the customer service is outstanding! Make sure you make your next appointment here, you will not be disappointed! Tracy and Leon both worked my nails!   Sincerely,  A Very Satisfied Customer
