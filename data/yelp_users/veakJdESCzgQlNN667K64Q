Usually come here on Saturday days and the bartender is Dalice. I sit and watch her work.  She greets customers even when she's busy,  tells them she will be right with them.  That in my opinion is great customer service.  She's efficient and friendly.  That makes a great bar.  Obviously the food was good and drinks even better.  Great service,  keep up the good work.

Very slow service.  The steak was over cooked, asked for medium and it was medium well,  no pink at all. Had a Groupon tried to use the remainder balance and it was a choir to use 10 dollars.  The waitress didn't explain the problem with the check, dropped it off and ran.  The manager sat at the bar off duty and complained about Sunday's with the bartender.  Overall not satisfied  The only good thing was music

I rented Jet limousines for my mother's 60th birthday and what an amazing job the company and the driver did.  I got the stretch limo and fit 60 balloons inside along with my parents and 5 friends.  Plenty of room.  The driver drove to where we wanted and waited and stayed out front so the driver was on time and ready to go.  Excellent service. . Thank you jet limousine and the owners.

I went to hair by Marcel and had some highlights added.  They turned out perfect,  she didn't cut to much off, just a nice trim. She washed and styled my hair with cute little clips. Now if only I can do this myself in the morning.  Thanks for a job well done.
