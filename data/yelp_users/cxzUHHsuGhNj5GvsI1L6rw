Taco Bell is quite possibly my favorite fast food restaurant but I've never had a good experience at this location. My order is wrong 50% of the time and they are less than enthusiastic about fixing it when you bring an error to their attention.

This is our favorite restaurant in Phoenix. My wife and I eat here probably once a week. The food is outstanding, reasonably priced and the staff has always been more than friendly. Give it a shot and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
