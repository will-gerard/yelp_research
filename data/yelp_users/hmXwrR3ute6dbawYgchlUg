We have eaten here many time and the food is usually good. Today it was horrible. Everything was cold. Cheese was not even melted in my sins burrito. My food was very greased and cold.

This Outback is below average. I had 10 oz Ribeye I ordered it rare came out 20 minutes later well done . The front door hostesses were too busy talking to each other to actually take our name to be seated. Finally interrupted them and asked to sit at the bar and wait for a table. Bar tenders were just like the hostesses to busy to acknowledge us. Customer service is horrible.

Very nice church in the west valley. If your in the area it's a great place to stop by and visit. Very large parish and school.

Good location but the hotel needs to be updated and the rooms need to be remodeled.  I think that the hotel is over priced and would most likely chose a different spot next trip,

Good location but the hotel needs to be updated and the rooms need to be remodeled.  I think that the hotel is over priced and would chose a different spot next trip.  Day 1 checked in the room was dirty and had to  be re-cleaned. Sat on the bed and the room lights went out....hotel took forever to fix.  Day 2 the  bathroom bathtub  drained exploded with back flow....called and no one came  up....Day 3  the AC quit  11pm called the front desk  again  and again and  again  and again...finally someone picked up and they told me the hotel uses a call center and that  they were not allowed to escalate calls.    Stay clear or here..............

Super service. David saved us a ton of money. This is a great store. Dave took the time to help me, my wife and my daughter find the perfect package. We bought 2 new phones and added a line. My daughter will save over $100 dollars a month moving to Sprint from T-mobile.  I plan to add my son and my parents to our plan. We will then save over $300 a month.

Seating is not very good. If you go before sundown be sure and get a spot that does not face the door.  Every time the door opens you will be blinded by the sun. Food is ok. Always ask for fresh ground wasbe it is very good.

This use to be a nice place. This trip the service was very bad and a cockroach ran across my wife's shoulders. The manager came over and killed it.  Employees were dirty. We won't be back.

The problem is they never have enough staff on hand at their restaurants. We watch people complain about this all the time but the managers never respond.  The players club is even worse. Long lines and unfriendly staff. No help available today to pay or fix slots it's a holiday.

Wow....good food and a lot of it!   Share your meal with a friend.   The spot is very  much worth going to and is a great value  for the Las Vegas Stripe.  The only negative we saw was the  hostess on arrival...everything else is A#1.

I purchased a complete living room set .  La-Z-Boy  brand thinking I would pay more for quaility.    I bought the extra  insurance too...boy what a mistake the product is  junk  and the warrenty is only good is you ship the furnature at your expense back to the factory for repair or pay an outragouse service fee.  Do not shop at La-Z-Boy  in Goodyear.....JUNK JUNK JUNK  that is expensive!

$18 dollars for a med size black coffee small bottle of water and a cinnamon roll that was at least 3 weeks old.  I wish I could give negative star rating. This place is set up just to exploit hotel quests.

We ordered 2 med burger meals and it took 30 minutes to prepare the staff is extremely unfriendly and could care less about service or quality.  The casino knows they have captive audience.

Not worth the drive from Phoenix. Food and drinks are way over priced. No real comps and the casino is in need of update. Slots seem to be at 80% payback..,, bad. They need some competition. Do not do the way over priced buffet. They have s captured audience and they are taking advantage of them.

16 bucks for a 99 cent pizza :(.   Way over priced. We would not go back. Service was very slow and food was over priced. We did like the wings. The pizza was horrible and way over priced.

The restaurant is very easy to find in the SLS hotel. The decor and atmosphere is fun and very well done. The food is excellent but very expensive.  Loved the suckling pork and the steak tartar.

I have now purchased to vehicles at this location. Sales staff is very friendly and knowledgable. Forget the service contracts you will wait forever and even an oil change can take hours.
