I've lived in the area for over 4 years and only recently discovered this place (too many great Mexican restaurants to choose from!) I've been twice and have enjoyed the food both times. Only giving 4 stars, though, because it's a little pricey for what it is. The sopapillas at the end are a nice touch.

I can't believe I hadn't heard of this place before.  I've gone 3 or 4 times now, and it's been consistently good.  Standard lunch price for a pizza place, good greasy pizza, and I enjoyed the boneless wings.  Next step is for me to become the FourSquare mayor, 'cause I'm all Web 2.0 and stuff.

This place is like home (not home away from home, literally home.)  I left for a year and a half to California (to do some prospecting or something), and this little brewery was top on a very short list of places I actually missed.  You know how nothing ever tastes quite the same as the way your mom made it, even if the food you're eating is much better than your mom's cooking?  No, I'm not saying something bad about your mom's cooking - I'm making a point here.  This is how Four Peaks beer is for me.   My resolution this year is to spend 4 days a week here in November when pumpkin porter is out.  I think I can pull it off - I -generally- show up for work 5 out of 5!

A coworker took a few of us here last week.  Honestly, it's probably not the BEST cheesesteak I've ever had, but I'm giving it a good review for 2 reasons:  1. They're as authentic as you're going to get in AZ.  Cheez Whiz is the only acceptable cheese on a cheesesteak. 2. I feel like every time I go into a place midday that's packed every weekend at 3am, I'm disappointed to find that the food is gross unless it's 3am and you're sweaty, drunk, and trying to impress someone (because let me tell you, cheez whiz stuck in your teeth really works).  In this case, it was not 3am, I was not drunk, and I was only the usual amount of sweaty, and the food was still good.

$4.00 for a lunch special in Tempe is pretty good, if you ask me.  If you're eating two slices of pepperoni pizza for lunch, I don't think you can complain that your pizza is "greasy."  (That's what they invented napkins and dabbing for.  Actually, napkins were probably invented for wiping your face, but they can be used for soaking up grease from pizza too.)    I don't know that I'll go out of my way for this one, but I won't complain about it either.  If I could give 3 and a half stars I would, so I'll be generous and round up (Barro's, if you're reading this and see my generosity, feel free to return in kind with free lunches for life.  I think that's a fair trade.)

Why are there so many of these self serve yogurt places?? And why did they all pop up around the same time, 4 or 5 years ago? Is the government tracking us through these places? If so, where did they get the technology to track people through froZen yogurt?  Anyway, this place is good, just like all of the other ones you've been to on every major corner in Maricopa County. It's yogurt and toppings. Kind of hard to screw up.

Strongly recommend you look elsewhere. I made the mistake of going here for my annual physical last fall, since I missed the onsite sessions at my employer. This place made me wait for hours (literally) for basic blood tests, and added unnecessary procedures to a basic physical to plump up the bill. To make matters worse, they billed to my insurance using the wrong diagnosis codes, so things that should be fully covered weren't. They were unwilling to change the codes even though it would cost them nothing. Oh, and their phones often don't work, so you can't even call to deal with them.  There are plenty of other good places to go - don't waste your time.

The food was fine, or just as fine as I found it before. The issue is the concept. Swiping a card everywhere I go? If you have to have a ton of staff just to show people how the restaurant works, you're doing something wrong. I watched our "guide" bump into two different people as he showed us around, which goes to show that everyone else was just as disoriented as we were.   Keep it simple!

Been here twice now and, overall, I'm a fan. They do a good job getting the pizza out quickly but at the right temperature (smart that they use thin crust only). They make sure to know in advance what you're going to put on the pizza so they don't overload it. Price is good.  I do agree with some of the reviews, though, that their system for keeping track of everything needs work. I've only been here when there aren't many people, but I can't imagine that having the cashier write down everything on your pizza as you order it is the best way to go.  As an aside, when I was here I overheard the owner/manager talking with someone who seemed like a regular. At one point one of them commented: "This is pretty smart. If you don't like your pizza, you only have yourself to blame." I have to say that I kind of agree.
