It's a snowboarder's toy store if you ask me. From soft/hard goods unavailable elsewhere to the rad advice from the staff, you'll be covered before you even hit the slopes. Thanks to the crew for bringing the chill mountain culture back down to the valley!

The service, the hospitality, the atmosphere and the food. Amazing!

If you want to deal with a bunch of kids who got picked on their entire lives and are finally getting a shot at retaliating by being a dick, go for it.  You gotta ask the right questions and even then, only get one word replies. No help, no guidance to beginner hobbyists.  I give everything three chances and all three generated the same experience and they've even changed their answers, putting me in a loop.
