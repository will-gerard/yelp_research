Sooooo delicious! Great experience even if you're trying Indian food for the first time. The service was fantastic, and our server was very helpful and patient with the whole party.

I've never received anything less than perfect service and a perfect meal. The appetizer combo is a phenomenal deal especially if you don't eat meat. Falafel, dolmas, hummus, babaganoush, tabbouleh, greek salad, pita bread and tsatsiki sauce. I'm full for days but I always want more!

The guy who works nights here is a real piece of shit. He just spent 5 minutes lecturing my friends on how American love is shallow and based on "fucky-fucky" and men should be worshipped by their wives "like Jesus Christ".

The clouds parted, and sunshine illuminated my path, I was able to follow all the wonderful fragrances to find my way to Lush!  Real talk: the staff was lovely. Very patient and helpful with any question I had regarding their products (it was my first time ever exploring their stuff) without being pushy. They were able to sell me what I needed and nothing I didn't.  Sure, their products are more expensive than what you can pick up at Walmart, but with natural, mostly vegan products ad a company that fights animal testing so vocally you are choosing to vote with your dollar. And honestly my products last forever, because they are QUALITY!  Some of their skin care items have completely changed my complexion, and I'll never go back!

I can't tell you how glad I was to quit this joint. No spin classes available was kind of a downer when I signed up, but I made do. Equipment was always overcrowded or broken, staff was always pushing personal training and would try their best to insult me into signing up. P.s. Not a great tactic guys.  The final straw was inquiring about adding my boyfriend to my account, we had been told one price at a different location and when we went to the 91st location to sign up Chad told us that was impossible and that we were ridiculous for coming in and wanting to haggle with him. When we didn't want to sign up for twice the price we were quoted he said "You can do what you want, I don't care!" Before walking away from us.  So thanks Chad, now we're both signed up for Gold's Gym

I've had a very positive experience with Gold's Gym, I'm only one week into my membership but so far everyone on staff has been very helpful without being pushy.   Dan was super helpful when I was picking out a plan and even though I wound up signing up online when I came in to get my card my boyfriend was so happy with the gym, classes and the staff that he signed up too.  I have my own training program that I'm following so I was apprehensive to ask the trainers for a body fat percentage check without getting the standard sales pitch on personal training. I spoke with CJ who said he could schedule me for an orientation at a different time if I was interested (since he was with a client) but if I wasn't looking to purchase personal training I could just check in with a trainer at any time to have a body fat percentage check and they would help me out. I've never seen trainers so approachable and willing to help; even in the women's weight room someone stopped a trainer walking by for advice on a particular machine and she was more than happy to stop and help.  I have friends who have been members for a lot longer and state that things have really improved since a change in management. So far I can happily say, these are not LA Fitness people. The administrative staff and trainers alike don't reek of the desperation of commission nor do they treat you like complete crap if you're an independent gym-goer. The positive attitude actually has me willing to consider the other perks they offer even if I'm not interested at this time.

I came here for lunch with a few friends on a Saturday, and we were all pretty disappointed. Overall, Picazzo's seems pretty full of themselves. When one of our drink orders came out wrong (diet coke instead of regular) the server looked at us like we were nuts. Sorry? Really didn't think that should have been such a big deal.  The food was not worth the price, it seems like this restaurant thinks they can get away with murder because they are all over organic ingredients and gluten-free crusts. Gluten-free or not, the margherita pizza was bland and tasteless. Covered in a thin sheen of olive oil (for flavor?) and skimped on the tomatoes and basil, it was dolled up cheese bread. The fruit and brie appetizer was okay, but the attention paid to presentation made it nearly impossible to eat. The pear-half and strawberry that came with our hunk of melted brie were really just incompletely sliced and that was supposed to look frou-frou? We had to remove the fruit to slice it completely so it could actually be eaten by more than one person; sort of the point of an appetizer, right? They also threw two heads of roasted garlic in the brie. While I can't deny that a whole head of roasted garlic is a beautiful thing, papery garlic skins mixed in with your melted brie are not. Neither is having to squeeze scalding hot cloves of roasted garlic into your brie. I was the only one in my group of friends who has roasted my own garlic so I had to wrap it in my napkin and squeeze it out onto a plate, again so more than one person could actually eat it. At this point we were all laughing at the ridiculousness of the restaurant and it's prices.  I hate to rate it so low, because I really think there could be potential here! Italian food gone organic and accommodating to dietary needs? Could be great, just seems like they've got no soul and there is no real attention paid to the quality of the food, which comes across as just profiting from the bandwagon.

So delicious! The amazing spices are going to haunt my dreams!  Unlimited chai, mango lassi, matter paneer and garlic naan... I almost died. Stole some of my boyfriend's raita that came with his lamb biryani (which was enough to feed two hungry people very happily) since my matter paneer was so deliciously spicy!  We were one of two guests on a Thursday night and waited for nothing, service was amazing, our server had great suggestions for both of us.

Our server seemed annoyed that we were there, I know realistically this means there was probably issues in the back that we're just being brought to the front. We ordered the caprese as an appetizer, 4 slices cost $8.Our pizza was pretty forgettable as well.  I guess I had really high expectations from people I know who have gone in the past, but I'm definitely not going back.

Rose & Crown.. we had a good run guys. But the last 4 times I've gone here service, food and even the beers have been terrible. I've had to make sure that I tell anyone I previously recommended The Rose & Crown to that I have to regrettably revoke my recommendation so that they don't disown me; it's gotten that bad.   The last four times I've been here I've been forced to drink St Mary's Pale Ale since none of the other beers I want are in stock, our service is always incredibly slow, no matter how many/few customers are there, and the food (which I honestly never loved) has gotten greasier, chewier and less delicious.

AMAZING! The staff was super helpful on my first trip out and I wound up climbing for 4 hours that night. I may not invest in a full-blown membership yet (climbing for one day had me sore for a week!) but I'll definitely swing by on Ladies' night (Wednesday) for half-priced climbing.

Delicious, decently priced vegan food. Now that they've taken down the Supreme Master TV broadcast the joint is even classier.

Hold up. Ima let you finish, but Cheba Hut makes the greatest sandwiches of all time!   It is my greatest earthly regret to have purchased a home juuuuuust outside of their delivery area.  Then again if I lived somewhere that could receive Cheba Hut deliveries I'd be 600 lbs and broke as a joke.  The staff is always super helpful! I'm an annoying vegetarian and they've got tons of options for my people. Magic Mushroom 4 Lyf! And their munchies are no joke!

From the beginning the service here was so-so, the boutique is open by appointment only and whenever I attended appointments for my friend who was the bride we ended up waiting for our consultant to arrive. The store in itself is limited in selection and not in the greatest shape. I tried on a few dresses myself which were stained, had broken zippers etc... When one of the sample dresses was too large I had to be "clamped" into it (taking in the excess fabric from the back with a spring loaded clamp). Unfortunately this took with it a chunk of my flesh. I understand mistakes happen, but seriously... Ouch!  My experience as a guest of the bride was mediocre but my friends experience as the bride in question has been horrific! I've encluded her side of the story.  "I picked out my dress in January 2012 and got measured for it in September. I got a phone call a month later that they can't find a manufacturer to make my dress. Ok,disappointing, but I was offered a refund or the opportunity to pick a new dress. When I arrived at the salon again, there was the dress I picked out, still on the rack (and not the rack designated as sample only; the rack of dresses available to be ordered.) I asked about it and got something of a brush off answer, no real explanation. A lot of questions I asked needed to be directed to the owner, who was not answering or returning phone calls. I ended up requesting a refund as offered, but no one seemed to know how to issue one and, again, no response from the owner. I was also told they had no record of how much I needed to be refunded as my receipt was with the unreachable owner. Fortunately I had my copy with me, but still walked away with no refund. It's been a week and still no word from anyone at Iris D. Unacceptable."

I've only been here once myself, and I wasn't impressed. The service was great, staff was very friendly and helpful, we waited for nothing, even though they were pretty busy with the game 6 crowd.   We got chips and salsa right away, the salsa was fresh but kind of boring, we asked if they had any hotter salsa which they brought out right away. This honestly seemed less spicy than the original and tasted more like ketchup. Stick to the original.  My boyfriend ordered the taco grande which was huge and tasty by his account. another star. As a vegetarian I didn't have many options, the only beans they use are refried with lard, so I ordered the veggie fajita burro, enchilada style which sounded pretty great. Food came out quickly but I have to say my burrito was a little... Taco Bell? Sauce was bland, the burrito was a lot of puffy flour tortilla and the veggies were too large to be consumed. I ended up ditching the tortilla and chopping up my vegetables with lettuce and the house salsa. Would have been a pretty average experience if I hadn't gotten violently ill on the way home. Not sure if even the veggie burro is safe for vegetarians. Sorry Popo's, I really wanted to like you, but I'm not coming back.

Eff this place. I paid 92 dollars for 2 tickets, 65 dollars for the two drink minimum which included well vodka tonics, and 12 dollars for parking because the show started over an hour late.   For that price I would expect phenomenal service and a great atmosphere. Instead, we all got crammed in to the most dangerously packed tables I've ever seen, and were treated like cattle by staff basically just looking to fill our 2 drink minimum before the end of the night, and that was the only service that we got. Our server walked down our table that was easily 40 people long taking drink orders for the whole table at once only to return over an hour later to deliver everyone's drinks at once. Same deal over an hour later. The server was sweet, and it obviously wasn't her fault.   This place is just run by the Montgomery Burns of comedy clubs.

Update:  the owner did reach out to try and offer me a better experience, which I think says something positive about the business. But honestly, I can't bring myself to go back, my experience the first time was that awful. Just thought I'd share, maybe service will improve?

I'll never use another cheapy online tax program again after coming here. These guys are awesome and did you know paying to have your taxes done is deductible on your taxes next year? I didn't know that! They helped my girlfriend and I figure out our complicated taxes and ended up getting us back several hundred dollars more than if we had done them online like we usually do. They've earned a customer for life.

I always dread coming here, I see Janee Bell and she is lovely but the office staff is what makes this yearly visit a real exercise in torture.  There's no one that answers the phone, any communication is made through a series of voicemails and callbacks, this means it is usually a couple of days for me to get scheduled.

The reviews so far are spot on. The biscuits and gravy are phenomenal and the staff is kind and attentive. What you may not notice is the amount of love and care that goes into this place. There is such an incredible amount of attention and love in every piece of the Coronado, do yourself a favor and forego another picture of your food on Instagram and look around yourself and take in the soul of this place, it's exceptional.
