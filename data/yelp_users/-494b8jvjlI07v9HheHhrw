I had been wanting to have barbeque for awhile. This was the only place that was close to me. I had read the bad to average reviews, but still decided to give it a shot.  That was a mistake. There was no other customers inside and the food was incredibly bland.   I decided to go with the 2 meat dinner combo. It ran just under $15. I went with pork ribs and sausage. For my sides I had Mac & Cheese and baked beans. The thing that had the most taste was was the baked beans and they tasted like they came straight from a can.    I would not recommend going here to anyone. I personally will not be going back.

Love Los Betos!!! It is nothing fancy, but after a night of drinking it definitely hits the spot. You don't have to be drunk to eat here, most of the food is good all the time. Personally I stick with their breakfast burritos and have never had an issue with it not being hot or cooked right.

It is a pricey place to eat, but it is very tasty.

I have had nothing but great experiences at this restaurant. I have only eaten wings here, but they have a large selection of other food. The selection of sauces for the wings is large. My personal favorite is the spicy garlic.The wait staff is good. Good prices on drinks. I definitely would recommend to others.

I have not sat down to eat here, I have always got it to go. The food here is just bland. How people give it four stars just blows my mind. The food seemed like it was sitting around for awhile in the kitchen before beeing served. I live 2 blocks from the place, so it didn't happen because I had to drive home.   I have given it multiple tries to make make sure it wasn't a one time bad mealI would not recommend this place to anyone.

Went here for lunch. They were very fast with the preparing the food. It has been a long time since I had a gyro and this one did not disappoint. Small sitting area for dining in. It cost $8 for a gyro, fries and a drink. I will definitely be going back here.

I have never eaten a regular meal here. I usually go for the reverse happy hour from 10-12pm. Cheap drinks, good food and a good atmosphere. The servers here are good. I don't eat sushi myself, but everyone I go with loves the Crunchy Crab Rolls.   They have three different pizzas, pepperoni, BBQ chicken and cheese. I have had the pepperoni and BBQ chicken. Both were extremely good. I definitely recommend that someone looking for a good time, cheap drinks, and good food.

This place has pretty cool rooms. It is about a block or two off of the strip. The two bedroom suite with the living room between is huge. We stayed here for a bachelor party that included 7 guys. More than enough room for all of us. There were two regular beds and two pull outs. The hotel connects to the Planet Hollywood Casino through a series of shops. Definitely worth staying here if you are with a big group of people. I would stay here again if I came with a group.

Went with the gyro combo meal, which has a gyro, fries, and a drink. The gyro was pretty good, but could probably use a little more sauce. The fries were also pretty good, some of them were a little undercooked. Everyone that worked there was nice. The person that I assume is either the manager or the owner offered me soup while I was waiting. The seating area was basically empty, so either it was slow or they don't have a lot of business. I would recommend other to it, I will be going back to give it another shot.

All they have here is chicken fingers. That being said, they are pretty good. They are nice and tender. I was not a big fan of the Cane's sauce. To me it tasted like one of the Hamburger Helper sauces. The Texas toast was very tasty as well.  I got the Cane's box combo meal which is 3 fingers,fries,a piece of toast, a cup of coleslaw, and a drink. It will run you just over $8. Like I said before pretty tasty overall, as it should be if you specialize in only one type of food. I would recommend it to others. I will go back myselfs as well.

This restaurant just opened 10/21/11. Went here with a couple of other people. I split the an Arizona style and a Glendale style burger. Both were pretty good. The Arizona burger was definitely the better of the two. We had a side of fries with one and onion rings with the other. The sides were okay, but they were nothing to write home about.  The staff was new so they were a little slow, but it was nothing to complain about. One of the owners was walking around talking with people to get feedback. I like to see that, it shows that they actually care about how their product turns out. Will definitely go back at some point for another round.

I have been here twice since it just opened. The first time I had the Original Italian, which has provolone,ham,proscuittini,cappacuolo,salami, and pepperoni. You can add the veggies and topping that you like. This sandwich was pretty good, but it didn't impress me that much. The second time I went I got the Big Kahuna Cheesesteak which has steak, grilled onions, peppers, mushrooms, jalape√±os, and extra cheese. Now this what was quite tasty. It is one that I will definitely go back for. Overall this place is pretty good and is definitely a nice break from places like Subway.
