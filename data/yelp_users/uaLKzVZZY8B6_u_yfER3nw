This place sucks, like really bad! But, the kids love it and this review is in honor of them. The food is awful! Only half the games work, the other half eat your tokens and doesn't dispense tickets. Chuck E and his friends couldn't be more "cheesy", the birthday show is lame as all get out, Chuck E can be terrifying (just ask my near 2 year old), and the prizes are totally lame too. All in all, a great place to bring the kids to give them a great time!   Personally, I believe Peter Piper is way better, only problem is their pizza is actually pretty decent and that coupled with the decent lunch buffet, prepare to defend yourself against an army of seniors looking for a cheap meal and a large place where they can all gather and elbow our darling kids out of they way in their pursuit of the last slice of desert pizza. You don't ever have to worry about crowds or flocks of seniors at good old Chuck E's! When the children are polled and Chuck E is the resounding reply, Chuck E it is!   The way I see it, the kids, they are never able to make too many decisions at this young age, so let us empower them and take them to DINGY Chuck E Cheese's when they request it!

Liberty Market is great. Like all the restaurants in the Joe chain, it is fun and unique in decor. It's neat to stand in line and watch the oven where the pizza's are made. They also have a wide variety of options here, one would be hard pressed to find something they did not fancy.  The place is typically packed so be prepared to wait and be in close contact with others.

I have been here a few times and went in today to fill some propane bottles. These guys are much cheaper than any of the other places and on top of that, if you have a rewards card, you receive a further discount off their already cheaper propane.  One of the guys took my bottles back for me and even though their tank was in the middle of being filled, they filled mine right up and I was done in no time.  The other times I have been there I have experienced nothing but knowledgeable staff whom are more than willing to help.

I try not to golf here because the course is kind of boring (in my opinion) and it's never in that great of shape. I have never had a relaxing experience because it's seems like there are people all over the place and a lot going on other than just golfing.  The only reason they are 2 stars and not 1 is because they do have a decent sized course and the price is pretty accurate and they'll have coupons every now and again.

Southwest is as good as it gets as far as getting from point A to point B effectively and efficiently. Of the literally hundreds of flights I have taken with them over the last 12 years, I can count on one hand the instances of unpunctuality, they are always on time, even when combating the airports that are notorious for delays, like SFO.   Southwest seems to do just about everything right, from their free bag checking (up to the first 2 bags I believe and under like 50 pounds, I rarely do anything but carry on) to no fees for flights changes, which comes in handy, especially when other air lines typically have a $20 minimum fee for such a cause. I also appreciate the staff on each flight. Most of the time, you'll get a slight comedy routine during the announcements and all you have to do is ask for the full can of soda and they gladly give it.  My one complaint, and this is why I don't recommend Southwest for especially long flights, the flights are typically very uncomfortable. I have only ever been on a handful of flights that weren't "standing room only", if you will. Which is great, this is how they are able to offer great prices and not charge to use the restroom, (you think I'm joking, just wait and see, it is coming from the other airlines soon...) they fill all of their flights and don't pass costs on to us, so it okay.    Also, the no assigned seating, no big deal, just set a reminder on your phone as I do and check in exactly 24hrs prior to the flight or if booked with less than 24hrs before the flight, check in right then and you have a much better chance of boarding with the A's.   All in all, Southwest will continue to be my airline of choice for any and all state side travel.

Ha! This place is a joke, but hey, what's one more one star review? They could care less; you would think after all the one star reviews they would do something about it but they just keep coming. The best part is, they advertise with Yelp, they pay Yelp to plaster their horrible reviews every where for all to see, they really have it together over there at mark kia.   This is simple, I called and asked for some information on a car and they never got back to me. Had they gotten back to me with the information I needed, I would have been walking off the lot with the car that same day. Tell you what mark kia, call me back and I'll update the review. But chances are, you have way too many calls that are waiting to be returned to ever get to mine so I'm sure this one star review will remain until the end of time.

I think this place is great. We'll jump on the light rail, head down for a game, and it's all relatively painless. The ball park is always nice and clean and you can get some pretty good deals on tickets. The whole family loves going and we are certainly not avid baseball fans.  I don't think anybody could go wrong coming to a game and checking it out.

Went on a Thursday night and was able to get in without a wait, unheard for this place.   Ordered the pablo picasso salad and an order of chicken wings, the medium golden kind.  Salad was, as always, very good. The wings were good as well, however, I would not ever get them here again because there are more unique items I can get here that I can't get elsewhere and wings are pretty common at most places.   My major beef is that I could not mix the type of sauce I wanted on my wings, all 14 wings had to be the same. I understand they probably have their reasons, and I asked as to what these reasons would be and the waited didn't know, but that doesn't mean they are legitimate reasons for not doing it. Any who, I don't care as i would never get the wings here again but I figured I would give them a shot.

We lived here for almost 2 years and were pretty satisfied overall. The apartments are pretty nice and priced about right. The pool was really nice because it is well maintained and very big. They also have propane grills down at the pool for any to use and they did a decent job of making sure the propane tanks were always full. They have a fitness facility and it's pretty nice but kind of small. The grounds are always kept pretty nice and there was never too much riff raff as far as the tenants go.   The front office staff was always pretty pleasant and the maintenance guys were pretty good. One time our AC stopped working late at night and they were able to get over pretty quick to fix it.   Another aspect we really enjoyed was the location. Within a mile or so, you have Target, Wal-Mart, Fry's, the mall, movie theater, cost co and a lot of different places to eat and close proximity to the freeway. The location is what we loved most.  Over all, not a bad place and would recommend to just about anyone.

Just when I think Joe's couldn't possibly be any dumber....they go and do something like this and totally redeem themselves!!!  This something I speak of would be the fabulous dinner partaken of by myself and my family this evening.  You see the first thing that must be done to fully enjoy Joe's is to arrive before 5 so you don't have to wait in line that is soon to pour out the front doors and into the parking lot. Tonight we arrived just before 5, placed our order, got drinks, sat down and were literally eating in 5 min.  My wife and I had burgers with garlic fries and the kids had pizza. My Burger, as always, was very big and accompanied by all the fixins. The beef patty was succulent and the onion ring added the perfect touch. My wife especially liked the bun, slightly toasted with a hint of butter and oh so fluffy.  The kids had plain cheese and peperoni pizza. The kids loved the pizza and the sample the wife and I had, confirmed the pizza's tastiness. The pizza's were large enough to save a portion for lunch the next day.  Our two youngest were able to adequately share one of the child's pizza's as well.   Tonight, being a true night of indulgence, we ordered a round of milkshakes. We had the vanilla bean and strawberry. Joe's milk shakes have always been second to none and tonight was no exception. They even split the strawberry one for us so the kids could share it in their own cups, that was great.   Believe it or not, the great food is simply an added bonus to the true intent of our visits to Joe's; The grounds create the most compelling lure for our active family (to put it gently) of 6  to come and enjoy a meal. You see, you can go to Chick-fil-A and brave and play area, but I have heard the horror stories of children going in, but never coming out...Well at Joe's, get food, sit outside and the kids can run a muck in the closest thing to the wild you will encounter in Gilbert. We will often plan to spend an hour/hour and a half at Joe's just eating and then enjoying the grounds. We will, on occasion, walk through the farms behind Joe's. I have even noticed they have a community garden back there, that is awesome.   To conclude this novel of a review, I close with this, tonight I noticed something at Joe's I have not previously observed and that would be the presence of some type of managerial figure on the premises. Typically, it seems that the youngsters working the registers and what not are the ones also left to hold down the fort. Well tonight there was a gal making the rounds and checking to ensure all was well. She came and talked to us seeking honest feedback on our experience to make sure it was the best it could be. This was much appreciated! Plus, she commented that my wife resembled the wife of a celebrity so my wife was loving that.    Any who, Joe's seems to back in the business of providing a 5 start experience each and every visit and for this, I salute you.

Reading the reviews for this place cracks me up, mostly because they are all true, the 1 stars and the 5 stars...too funny.   Yes, the biz operates in a very counter intuitive manner, I mean come on, cash only (they do now have an ATM at the front, after 70+ years in biz...), no restroom, the employees are anything but friendly, even when they call your number, they say "24", not even "number 24" or "now serving..." just the number, and in such a disgusted tone. And nothing but outside seating in the scorching heat (although they do have misters)?   But really, would any other tactics do this place justice? The place is nasty, in a nasty part of town, what, should they have spent some money unnecessarily, given the place a little spit shine, made it pretty, trained the staff to be more chick fil A like? No across the board, their biz is perfectly in line with the totality of their circumstances.    Now, where I do disagree with the 1 star reviews is the food. It may be nothing more than "glorified fish sticks" accompanied by "watered down ketchup", but dammit that watered down ketchup has el pato sauce in it and the fish sticks are much larger than the kind you buy at the store, plus they are deep fried. So five stars for the food!   My wife gets so angry because this is my chosen place for birthday lunch each year. I must admit, there is a component of nostalgia to my five stars and that would be due to the re-enactment of cherished moments of my youth (as I shed a lone tear...) because Pete's was one of the few strong holds that continued to offer Dr. Slice after many others stopped. Anyone remember Dr. Slice? How they ever stopped making that, I will never know.   Any who, should I ever find myself on death row requesting my last meal, Pete's Fish and Chips will lay claim to that honor!

Right to the point, everything here is 5 starts, except for one thing...which I will address at the very end. Service was great, got there with about 40 million people there and waited less than 5 min. to be seated. Ordered our food and was eating within 15 min. After we ate and paid, went outside to see if there was going to be live music that night. There are already many details regrading the grounds for this place so I will not go into that. The band was setting up so we just walked around waiting for them to start playing so we could then dance the night away.    My wife order a steak and loved it. We also had an order of their fried pickles and we loved that as well, they were a little spicy so that made it even that much better. Salad bar with my wife's stake was good as well. My burger on the other hand was three stars. I'm not sure who is at fault, me for not indicating or the waitress for not asking, but the way in which I would have liked the burger cooked was never discussed and it came out well done and I would have ordered it med. rare. Anyways, I really didn't eat but a few bites as I was pretty full from the appetizer and saved the rest for later. When I later ate it, it was way too cooked and not good. Had I eaten that much at the restaurant, I would have sent it back for sure. Anyways, everything else, 5 stars, even the price. Oh, FYI, potato cakes are pretty rank, don't get them as a side.   Would not hesitate to come back but would stay away from the burgers.

I wish I had a better explanation for the low rating but all I know is each time I eat here, I get sick. It's crazy because the place seems clean, the food doesn't taste bad or seem gross so I'm not sure. My wife and I ate here tonight and were walking out asking each other why we had because we know we'll feel ill afterwards.  All that I can think of is that they put some sort of filler in the food and I'm no conspiriest (besides that I know for a fact we have not ever landed on the moon and that area 51 will soon be fully exposed for what it truly is).  Not sure what the deal is but besides getting sick each time, $11.95 for a salad buffet, sounds a little redonkulous if you ask me, throw in some flippin meat and maybe I would reconsider the price.

I am not much of one for a stiff drink (as I am trying to quit), but I do come here to indulge in the fine selection of obscure soda pop. The conventional stuff (the pepsi and coke products) are not worth buying here as the are over priced, but turn the corner and there is a whole wall full of soda and soda flavors you would only dream of. If you fancy a deviation from the run of the mill carbonated drinks, hit up this selection and you will not be disappointed. Last time I was here I got a peach pie flavored soda to give you an example, it was nasty as crap, but still fun to try!

What more can I say that has not already been said in other reviews...This place is by far the best as far as fast mexican food goes and in fact, I will take it over most sit down chains as well, like mi amigo's.   Senor Taco is much better than Filberto's (and I do like them as well) because the prices are pretty much the same and Senor Taco seems to just use better ingredients. The burrito's are huge and I have never had a less than superb one. I like the shrimp burrito and my wife salivates over the mere though of their bean and cheese burrito.  I have also had the fish tacos and it is in fact, something to write home about. I also really like their chips. For under $2 you can get a decent sized bag of really good chips and their salsa bar is a million times better than filly b's.  All in all, you can't go wrong here, 5 stars for sure.

Oh my flip! Had the California surfin burrito tonight, it was crazy good! One of the best burritos I have ever had. As always, this place is excellent. In fact, we were in the area for a b-day party and intentionally burned about two extra hours so we could hit this place up for dinner.  One could never go wrong eating here!

Ate there last night and this was our first time at this location. Decoure and atmosphere aren't as neat as the phoenix location but the food and service was great. Had me some chicken and waffles with a side of grits, the Mrs. had the chicken strips and loved them, espcially the seasoned fries with ranch. I'm not a huge fan of the kool aid but got the blue kind last night and it was really good.You can never go wrong with a little (or a lot) of Lo Lo's!

Had to get me some new boots for my sports car (chevy cobalt, metallic orange baby!) and we typically come to discount for tires, although we have never been to this location.  I had a flat and wanted to see if they could repair it. I knew the tire was in pretty bad shape, but I tend to live life a bit on the edge, especially when it comes to pushing the life of my tires to the max. I was fully prepared for my rebuff for when I knew they would inform me I really should just get a new tire.   They came out and looked at it and of course said "sir, you're going to need a new tire". Then he showed me where the sidewall was all blown out and it really couldn't be repaired. I asked what is the absolute cheapest I could walk out of here with a new tire and he told me a very fair price so I told him I would take two and he agreed.  A few months prior I had replaced the other two tires so I was curious to see what the difference in price would be. These guys were a hundred+ bucks cheaper and these also included a warranty.

I rarely review chain restaurants for food quality because it is pretty much the same. So...this is based on service. Steven was great! We had a large party (16 to be exact) and were never left wanting for anything, Steven was all over it and very professional. There was also another server that helped out with drinks and anything else we needed and between the two, we felt about as much like royalty as one could feel at a simple Olive Garden. One in our party had asked for light sauce on here pasta and the dish came out not quite as light on sauce as she would have liked. The server offered to replace it but the individual decided it would be okay. Well, as we were about to leave, the server came out with a new dish, with less sauce, to take home insisting she receive the dish in a satisfactory state, even if it was to enjoy later. The manager even come in and checked on us. Now that I think of it, we probably just looked like trouble and they wanted to make sure there was not cause for any type of commotion, I guess, or they are just a great Olive Garden, my bet is on the latter.

Ahh Steve's! It doesn't get much better than this as far as a good ole sandwich goes. Potbelly, you can take your fancy $12 sandwich and go rob someone else blind! Subway, you can take your bland processed everything and bore someone else to death! Jimmy johns, you can take your weird sounding guy on your commercials and be freaky fast on someone else! I love Steve's! Great bread, great selection and it is as cheap as it comes. I always get to poorboy and love it every time. My wife loves the turkey and provolone and the kids love the pizza boat. Good stuff!

Came here to have my 20 month old get her leg x-rayed. The place was packed but the waiting room has comfortable chairs and is nice and clean. It would be nice if they had some magazines in the waiting room, but this does not factor into my review, just a suggestion.  After waiting 45 min. we were called up to the front desk where they informed us they aren't going to be able to proceed because the x-ray request from the doctors office is missing the word "ankle". Apparently they needed exact specifications that the x-ray was to take place from the knee to the ankle, it did not suffice to simply have from the knee down....  They tried to call the doctors office to get clarification but they were going to be gone for the next hour for lunch. Luckily, we were able to get our doctor on her cell phone (yes, our doctor is so awesome that we have her cell) to confirm that the x-ray was to proceed to the ankle.  Now, I can understand making sure you do exactly as the Doctor's order but two of the staff members were bickering about whether or not to just proceed. It was very aggravating and what if we had not been able to contact our Doctor? It would have been a huge waste of time, use some flippin discretion for crying out loud!  But what can you expect, this is how all medical facilities operate and that is why they get 2 stars, just under par for the course.

I have eaten here several times and for the most part, dinning in seems to be a solid 3 stars, maybe 4 if I'm feeling particularly generous. However, I will never be a customer here again, in any fashion. Why? Because of their utter failures in the take out department. 2 flippin times these clowns have ruined our night by butchering our take out order. I would call to express their liability for the screw up and no responseability was ever taken. Were it not for the decent dine in experiences  we have had, this would one star for sure.

I have been here numerous times for dinner, and what can I say, I always come back, partly because it's about the only choice real close by and I really can't complain too much about the food. Love the chips, red and green salsa and the bean dip. The servers have always tried their best to make sure we were well taken care of. I typically get the stuffed relleno and it's not the best but satisfying at the same time. My wife will often get the quesadilla and she really likes it (the one with chicken and gauc).   Now, the other morning we went here for breakfast and it was pretty good. They have a nice selection of both American breakfasts and Mexican. I would come back for the breakfast for sure.

We have been eating Barro's for years and they have never disappointed. I don't know that I have ever actually eaten in, I have always had delivery or pickup. We typically look at the online specials and go from there. Tonight, we ordered an ex large 1 topping pizza with 24 wings (tommy like wingy) totaling just under 30 doll hairs.  There were 3 adults and 3 kids and there are plenty of left overs so I like to believe it is a good amount of food for your buck, but most important, the price and quality coincide very complementary. We are huge fans of their wings and in fact, I have formed a pretty special bond with their medium extra crispy ones. I also really like the amount of cheese used (heavy) on the pizza's and they don't spare on the toppings either.  Over all, it's always a great eat!

What can I say, Chipotle is Chipotle and I will continue to eat here until the end of my days. However, this location is exceptional because of service from the employee's. The line is continually out the door and they always handle the mad rush with great composure. I believe Paul is the manager on most occasions when I visit and he really knows how to rally the troops and keep things moving making it a much more enjoyable experience for the lunch rushers. Come here for your typical Chipotle meal but with a guaranteed satisfactory experience with the staff.

I always had mixed emotions about this place, it seemed as if Dr. Werther was so hit and miss, one appointment he would be fine and the next I would question the validity of his medical training in all aspects, especially his bed side mannerism. We also had a family member that went here who concurred with our sentiments.  We had been wanting to switch doctors for a bit but the process was expiated after this experience.... one morning our 16 month old daughter woke up and could not walk and her knee was very swollen. I immediately knew this was a much more serious situation than just a swollen knee. I told my wife to get her into the doctor ASAP with the caution to demand testing and actual proof of whatever opinion the doctor held.   My wife went and the brilliant Dr. Werther didn't even have to see our daughter, did not need to examine the knee, check her out in any other way and was able to skillfully conclude it was a simple viral infection and would go away soon. Protest and suggestions to exam her and run tests where shot down in the sometimes (remember, depends on the appointment) demeaning manner. I would recommend Dr. Werther start doing appointments over the phone as examining the actual patient is not even required for his brilliant diagnose.   Well my wife and I wasted no time seeking a second opinion and were blessed to go to a doctor that was willing to listen to the uneducated swine that pay the bills of these fancy doctors like Dr. Werther. Turns out the poor little thing has JIA, youngest diagnoses any rheumatologists in AZ has seen. Our rheumatologists has repeatedly told us how lucky we were to catch it so soon, had we not, our daughter would be in a wheel chair right now and would have undergone several joint replacement surgeries.  Now, I understand that people make mistakes, but one must consider certain standards pertaining to their patciular field. The garbage man, sure I'll give you plenty of screw ups without being too harsh, but mess with my kid, no dice! Dr.'s have to bring their A game day in and out and Dr. Werther didn't seem to display behavior consistent with any type of A game on most visits.

I went here once, but that was all it took, apparently. My feet had been hurting me so I went in to see what was up. This place is right by the hospital in San Tan Valley so it's a great location to those in this little more of a remote area.   The Doctor, can't remember which one, came in asked some questions, did some tests/x-rays and gave me the skinny on what the felt was going on, I was there for less than a hour. Doc gave me a prescription and my feet have not bothered me since and I have stopped taking the medicine.  The only thing I didn't like and I didn't factor it into the review because I know it can't always be helped was that they billed me after the appointment, I hate receiving a bill in the mail because of an unforeseen cost the insurance won't cover, but like I said, I did not factor that into the review because it is a very common occurrence with many medical offices.

Would I ever really oppose to eating here, not really, especially when the majority is ruling, like the other night. The food is three stars. However, I was in the vast minority compared to the rest of the large group with pretty much all of them proclaiming this as their last meal should they ever find themselves on death row.  I had the honey bacon club with the chicken chop salad and my wife had the Wisconsin cauliflower soup with the chicken chop salad as well. My wife loves the soup and I tired some and it was not bad, but I'm also the furthest thing from a soup guy as can be.  I like the sandwiches much better than paradise and the salads may be just as good were it not for the dressing, it was like this watery crap and I'm pretty sure blue cheese dressing should contain at least some blue cheese, in most countries anyways.   So we paid about 20 doll hairs for 2 combos and one soft drink. It is pretty expensive but I would not say a horribly bad buy because you get a piece of bread and the chocolate covered strawberry so you can walk away pretty satisfied, I guess.     Overall, I have bumped it up to 4 stars because I took into account the staff, who where very pleasant. But remember, 3 stars for the food. I'm sure I'll be back but I think next time I'll get a lone sandwich.

This review is going to basically follow suit with many of the others...doubt I will be back and here is why:  1. They take forever and do not give accurate predictions as to how long it will take for your food to be ready 2. We order pizza and it was not the best. Hardly any cheese on the pizza and especially greasy.  3. The staff seems less than attentive. I sent my 6 year old up to get something and she stood there as employee after employee walked by and didn't notice her, I finally had to get up and intervene. Now, this has little impact on the review, I would hardly hold that against them but was kind sad, poor little gal. 4. The place is too small. Not enough seats and crowds quickly.  I have partitioned the other Geno's I know of in Gilbert and that one has never had any problems so I'll tell you what, message me when you are up to par with the flagship and I'll swing back by and update review if I find it to be true.

We have been coming to Healing Hearts for over 3 years now and could not be happier. Now, there is no such thing as a perfect business but the business's held to a higher standard should be medical facilities, especially pediatric ones. Dr. Wilcock is our primary pediatrician but when she has been away we have seen many of the other doctors and have been to all of their locations and have been generally satisfied.   Dr. Wilcock really could not be more wonderful! She takes time to make sure each visit is conducted in a completely satisfactory manner. Dr. Wilcock is very thorough and makes sure everyone is on the same page. Dr. Wilcock also makes sure there is a game plan, when necessary, before we ever leave. We know what we need to do, who we need to contact,  and everything in between.   This comes in handy as our 4 year old has a autoimmune disease that requires a lot of correlation with her other specialist. Worthy of noting, Dr. Wilcock was the one able to diagnose our daughter when our previous pediatrician was so disgracefully unable to do so (yeah, i'm talking to you Dr. Werther).  We have also been completely satisfied with the front office and appointment setting. Wait times have always been minimal as well.

The theme is pretty hip and cool, if you will. Place is nice and clean with a bunch of friendly workers. There are plenty of options to choose from as far as what type of pizza you would like. It's similar to subway where you go through the line and can indicate what you would like on your pie. You can also pick a pizza with pre - determined ingredients if it's not one of those thinking days. I got the 11" island pizza and it was pretty good. The place was very busy but the order came out pretty quick (even with the line out the door, I was still able to order and eat in under 25 min). I also got a side salad for 2.99. I would not get the salad agian. It's not that the salad is bad, but it is nothing to write home about and the pizza is more than enough for a typical eater. I got a drink as well and the grand total was 10 bucks or so, a pretty good value. I would come back for sure.

Fact of the matter is this, there is no such thing as a 4-5 star traditional fast food place, in fact, I refrain from reviewing them because guess what, I would give no consideration to what others have to say about a "Burger King", "Wendy's" or "Taco Bell", I would never even look them up on Yelp, you pretty much know what you are going to get. I have yet to encounter that special "Taco Bell" that just hits it out of the park with their version of the taco, the crap is all the same. And oh no, someone was rude to you at the fast food joint??? The nerve!!! Alert the authorities! Who cares, not I. I can handle someone with a crappy attitude as they hand me my number 1 (as long as I don't suspect I'll find a fat loogie in the food anyways).  So what of In-N-Out? In-N-Out is special, we all know this. Most fast food places would be likened to a distant relative that would barley receive a hello in casual passing. But not In-N-Out, not at all. In-N-Out is the beloved older 1st  cousin, in your youth, that made or broke a family get together. The older 1st cousin that helped you determine that getting your ear pierced as a boy was not only acceptable, but pretty darn pimp. The older 1st cousin that had a flippin girlfriend and would hold her hand and what not in public, and not even bat an eye at it. The older first cousin that helped you light and take a drag of that fateful first cig. That older 1st cousin that gave you the courage finally verbally proclaim your first profanity!  In other words, In-N-Out, I'm in love with you and I don't care who knows it! Yelp, you are my roof top and it is on this roof top that I yell for all the world to hear, "In-N-Out, I LOVE YOU!"  Thank you.

I have to agree with many of the other reviews claiming this place to be over priced. So what gives? Why the 5 stars Clint??? Because, this place is better than any of the other bakery/cafe/sandwich places around and I typically grade on a curve on almost all reviews, a curve that is relative to the specifics of a particular biz as they relate to similar businesses and specifics.  So, as far as bakery/cafe/sandwich, I would take this place over Paradise or Zupas any day. But they are a pretty penny.

We had been meaning to come to this place for a bit and finally did over the weekend. I was leery about the wait we would most likely encounter, both for a bay and if we ordered food (as that seemed to be the reoccurring theme in reviews, takes forever to get a bay and food/drinks), which I will address as the review goes on.  We went with two other couples and got there about 6 o'clock. When you get there you encounter an array of employees that seem to be present for the sole purpose of greeting people and seeing if the can assist in anyway. Although I didn't really need any guidance or direction to determine I needed to go wait in the clearly present line, I guess it was the though that counts.   We got up to the counter and they gather various personal information, some of which I was reluctant to give, I was there to merely hit golf balls, not to refinance my home. But whatever, no big deal. There were some problems printing off our "life time membership cards" and that took a bit long, which was no biggie, unless it is compounded by all the people in line and that could create a very long wait, so I hope it is not a regular occurrence.  The total for one bay, for one hour, between 3 couples was $26 per. This did include a one time fee of $5 per person for the "life time membership card". Not a bad price I would say, it will about the same as a movie on the next visit because there will not be the $5 fee.  They told us we would have about a 45 min. wait. With this in mind, we decided to eat there because we didn't have time to go elsewhere and come back. I told everyone we may have to be a bit assertive because Yelp reviews suggest slow service for food. We went and found a table in the restaurant and waited. Well someone came by after just a few min. and we never felt neglected the rest of the night. Food came in a very timely manner, and the place was packed, and drinks were always refilled quickly. Look like they have been able to work out some of the kinks other reviewers had experienced.  This is where the star deduction comes into play. We had finished eating and still had not been called to a bay. We were told 45 min. and that was over an hour ago. Now, I would have been fine waiting for 2, 3 hours, had that been the given estimate. I can not stand being told an appeasing wait time that is more than 15-20 min. off and we waited for over an hour and a half.  So we got to the bay and the gal there was great. She stopped by regularly and made sure we were doing okay. Now for the only reason I really liked the place, the golfing. It was a lot of fun to be able to play the different games and to be able to track each shoot, as the balls have sensors in them.  Overall, it was really crowded, long wait times, but the crowd was not obnoxious, the venues is superb, and anyone from old timmers to teeny boppers could have a great time. You do not have to have any experience golfing or even really like golf.  The only thing that rubbed me the wrong way was the somewhat audacious mannerism of the business. They seem to take a lot of liberties in assuming they will simply just say give us this or that and that it will be done without question, like them wanting my birth date and address, which is fine, but please ask for that, nicely, don't assume everyone is okay with just giving it. Same with the credit cards while ordering food, I understand you have to do that as it would be very difficult to keep track of people and could be subject to dining and ditching, but please, ask nicely. And who says I even want to be a lifetime member? Or have this fancy card with my name on it.   I know I am being nit picky and no one else would really care, but doing these little things would be a 5 star biz and not 4.

Went here with a party of 15+. Because of the large group, we received a dollar off per person. It is a pretty typical trampoline park, however, they do have a little rock climbing area the kids love and a ninja, as they call it, obstacle course. So that is pretty cool and not something I have seen at other parks.   The staff was pretty good. It's places like this were martial law is typically exercised by the rowdy, at times, ruthless prepubescent whippersnappers bouncing off the walls. The staff kept everyone in line and were not afraid to make sure safety and the rules are observed.   We ended up paying $50 for 2 adults and 4 kids, all under the age of 8 for an hour of jumping. Our group ended up being divided into to two different jumping hour increments, giving the other group a whole half an hour of jumping when we started jumping just minutes apart. Well they were more than understanding and gave the portion of the group whose time had expired an extra half hour so our group could remain together.  The crowning jewel to this place and the feature that bumps it up to 5 stars is the Steve's Krazy Subs located within the building. I love Steve's (see my review for them)! It is a great combination.   We will be back for sure, but next time we talked about doing it as a date night so we could enjoy all the features unencumbered by the wee ones.

The kids had spring break this week so we hit this place up. We had a blast! And I'm not sure, but I think the basket ball hoops are new. They also have those smaller foam pits you can jump into and do tricks and what not. We had a little mix up that caused us some frustration but the staff, in particular, John, went above and beyond to stress our importance as individual customers. We will be back for sure, probably even this week.

This is a nice little place all the way around.   My wife and I could appreciate the effort put into the decor of the restaurant and making it nice atmosphere. They try, and succeed, to put on a real nice evening from top to bottom regarding the dinning experience.  Service was good. The waitress helped us navigate the menu and even alerted us to the fact that we had ordered a decent amount of food and throwing an order of soup to top it all off, may prove too much to handle. I could see this as coming across strange to some, but for me, it was appreciated as we had not idea what the portion sizes were.   We ordered egg rolls to start. There were 5 mini ones and they were veggie. They were pipping hot and they were pretty good; not bad for a 4$ appetizer. My wife ordered the chicken pad thai, at a medium hot level. She really liked it, and I, who am not a huge pad thai fan, found it pretty good as well. I ordered the phanaeng curry with chicken at a medium hot level too. I really enjoyed it. It was really good and the spices was perfect. The medium heat was almost perfect for me, maybe just a little too hot, I would say it was about 2 notches above that of a jalapeno.  We will be back for sure to try some of the other dishes.
