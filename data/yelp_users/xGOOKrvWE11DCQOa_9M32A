So far not a great experience. . Was left standing up the front waiting so I called the store so someone would come to the front. We get seated, waitress ask about drinks, no smile, takes our order still no smile...hmm hopefully the food is good.

So 4 month and yet again visited not on a busy night. Greeted nicely directed to seating. Drink orders and food taken immediately,  However that's it.. they forgot drink.. something about had to do something got tied up..some reason. Food took forever and when it did arrive not even look close to the picture.. says topped with ketchup, mustard, and pickles. No sir no its not. Also says made with 100 beef, hashbrown this is true and tomatoes, onions and cheese. .. hmm well has browns where inside ... before yes. Over cooked and greasy.. none of the other items. Half a slice of plastic American cheese made into two triangles..beef and some tomatoes of. Top. Now when delivered I asked for ketchup and hot sauce. Was told just a moment.. again no mam.. I sat there looking good and then the server said oh yeah you asked for ketchup. Yep what should have been on the omelet already.. really very very disappointed. Wow  I miss my IHOP in Avondale they were awesome. Very disappointing

I come here way to often and always have an awesome experience. Tonight was a mess, nor only did it take an extremely long time for the food, when mine came out it was uneatable.  It was burnt on edges, crisp amf soaked in strawberry syrup. In the time I was waiting a table of 8 left,  the ladies behind me changed theirs to go and my three year old was starving. The servers were amazing as ALWAYS, BUT NOT ONCE DID I SEE THE MANAGER COME ON THE FLOOR TO CHECK ON THINGS, APOLOGISE OR ANYTHING. Until I asked for him, even then  I got he had to help in the kitvhen. I get it but when your losing business,  people walking out,  oders changing to Carryout...you make it your business to check the floor even if it's one round.  The servers were more apologetic then the  manager, which then I felt bad for them add they are awesome.

I understand the place is busy, we were seated and then waited...waited...wIted..finally we had to grab a girl walking by just to get water. We then met our waiter who took our order, our bead and salad came out, we ate, our soup came..all while my 4 year old was still waiting for her food, finally I got up and went to the front waited for  a mansger, made a complaint.  The manager did take off the child's meal which I was thankful. .. I want to do a SHOUT OUT THOUGH TO SOMEONE WHO WENT OUT OF HER WAY FOR US A SERVER BY THE NAME OF TAMEKA ..I might have spelt that wrong, she checked on us, and took care of us EVEN THOUGH WE WERE NOT HER TABLE.THANKYOU!!!!!

Another awesome visit... amazing customer service by Christina. .. Ihop is lucky to have some amazing employees... I asked about employee recognition how to submit something. . However I was told there really isn't any. .. cone on Ihop value those who keep your business going. .. who set your reputation, who are the face of your business. . The food us ok, but I come die to the service and the people who work here. .

Friday I had the pleasure of recieving a massage at the Moon Valley Location, the front desk assisted me in making 3 reservations, which on a Friday isn't easy this was the third location I called. Brandi C. Was my therapist and she was amazing, she took the time to find out what areas I needed concentration on, encouraged me to stretch and drink lots of water. It wasn't fake she genuinely cared. The massage was relaxing, as well as lossened up my neck area... my headache was lessened. When I came out the front desk where sweet & polite, while also two off the managers checked in Pedro & Darren to ensure my visit went well. Amazing customer service,  thankyou for my experience it is one I WILL share.

Just checked out adding to this review... worst expetience EVER. Franchised owned.. Dorothy was AWESOME while upset she went above and beyond to make me feel better. Thankyou Dorthy!!! Prior to checking out the actual customer service is disapointing. Yesterday I went down stars for breakfast half the food was there,  it was not so great. The eggs had hard bits in it... the girl who was over the food section was not attentive. Last night I mentioned to the front desk I had difficulty with the Honors WIFI, I asked for help. . I got a answer that was wrong.  My room was not fully cleaned. It was disappointing.

Unbelievable $6 for chicken bowl had less then 1/4 of a chicken. When asked how much for a side of chicken we were told $9 to $10. Now a manager cannot come cause he's cooking...REALLY!

First time here flew in early, my server was Hellena who exemplified excellent customer service and was very attentive. My food was bought out nice and warm, fresh and well presented. It was quick service as well. When your ready to order you flip s little egg to yellow and they come to help you. Would definately come back. Place is clean, has booths and tables or you can sit up at the bar..

Why 5 stars? So first I am in town on business so I went by myself last night and sat at the Sushi bar.  This is were immediately I was greeted by Scott & Alex. Great smiles, attentive in their service, I ordered a roll, miso soup. and a glass of plum wine. I hate going out by myself, but Scott & Alex talked with me the entire time and it made it a amazing experience.  So while the food is great, the service by Scott  in particular and Alex is why I would definately  return here.

I was very impressed when I walked in to the location, it was bright an fresh. I saw Heather who made the entire experience both painless and as comfortable as waxing can be. I highly reccomend her if you ate looking for someone to feel comfortable with. The tables were very comfortable, sufficient time was taken to give a WOW experience. This was my first time with soft wax.

First we spent over a hour waiting which on a Friday is normal, we were seated and our server was Sisavanh who she walked by and said she be with us, 5, 10, 15 minutes pass nothing finally we grabbed another server Lexy who was amazing!!!!.  The food situation came out stanggard, while it tasted amazing we didn't get our dinner roles till about 30 minutes or longer in our service. We saw Sisavanh once to order sausages and 10 or so minutes after we ordered she came back to confirm the order. ..really?  All I can say is my experience at the Tempe location..Amaxing..Westgate not so.. but thank you Lexy for making our experience better...

You want not only a clean wax. But a pleasant, friendly, customer centric experience? Then you have to ask for Heather, she is passionate, experienced, well versed in the craft of waxing, that no hair will evade her technique!!!  So call mow..ask for Heather!!
