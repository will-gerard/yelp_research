Growing up in NY I had Lincoln Center and in AZ we have The Phoenix Symphony which is phenomenal!!!  Such an amazing group of talented musicians!  We have seen many many shows here and they are always super.  The acoustics are great, there is not a bad seat in the house and even the concessions are reasonable.  Taking light rail from Tempe is a breeze as it drops you within a .2 mile distance from Symphony Hall, so you dont have to deal with parking!  Many places to eat before or after the show as well.

Got a great deal on a membership and I really enjoy walking around the garden. We attended Dog Day in the Garden and it was a blast.

Have driven by this place for years never been in, until now. We decided to try it out during restaurant week.  The restaruant has been around since 1986, decor is older but rustic, it is family owned.  We all ordered off AZRW menu, starting out with the hot antipasti, which included a veal and spinach stuffed zucchini, crab stuffed mushroom and shrimp scampi, the sauce on the scampi and zucchini was made for scooping up with the hot bread for sure.  One person at our table had the goat cheese bruschetta and the goat cheese was delicious.  For the main entree 2  out of the 4 got the squid ink lobster ravioli and shrimp dish, I got the Dover Sole and the other person got the Chicken Rollatini.  The food was amazing and the service was top notch even on a very busy Saturday night.  Dessert was Tiramisu and the Black and White Mousse, both were large servings and amazing!  During dinner we were discussing this restaurant and a couple of others we like, we found out that the owners of Christos are the same as Alexis in Phoenix, which is another restaurant we like.

Locally owned and the food is fantastic and also locally sourced.  The cedar plank salmon is one of their best sellers and is delicious and the beef short rib just melts in your mouth.  The other really good dish is an appetizer that you can share and that is the The Original Griddled Corn Cakes.  Layered corn cakes with black beans, chicken and cheese, it is awesome.  Give this place a try and you wont be disappointed.

If you are in Terminal 4 you are in for a lot of shops and dining both before and after security.  Using the Sky Train is also an easy way to get in and out of the airport.

Ive been a a couple of locations but this one is the best by far!  The food was so delicious. The service was good, attentive but not annoying.  The Chefs Board was really good, had enough to share with 4 people.  We also had the pork wings, who knew pigs had wings, I am sure glad I know now, they were amazing!

Although this place seems like a tin box from the outside and yes you can hear everything from the outside, let yourself get past that and go inside, the staff is great and helpful and will get you feeling great out on the range!

This was my first time at Texas Roadhouse, my family wanted to go for an early dinner.  We were greeted and seated promptly.  Our server was sweet and patient. They give you these hot rolls when you are seated with a sweet butter, they are good but dont eat too many or you wont eat yer supper ;)  There are also buckets of peanuts to snack on as well.  The sirloin was recommended and I was leary because sirloin tends to be chewy and dry, however, I was very happy when it came out and was perfectly pink and delicious.  The other diners with me had the roasted chicken which looked good and sweet potato as a side dish which was tasty.  I had lemonade and the server was quick to bring another at the sight of mine being 3/4 done which was great, it tasted homemade but I didnt ask if it was.  Overall a good experience

If you have not been here, you need to go!!!!  If you dont live nearby, take the drive, its worth it!  They carry everything from every country it seems.  The produce is great and they have things you just cant get at the grocery store.  There is a bakery with lots of yummy items. I came in for fresh lychee and chili sauce and I am glad its close to home.

Great food so be prepared for a wait at lunch and on the weekends.  The cinnamon bun is HUGE so get one to share with the table, tons of frosting on top and hot....yumm.  Everything is delicious and they have great lunch specials.

Found this place on Yelp while searching for places that have good cannoli. Was heading to a family dinner and was needing these but they had to be great because we are all from back east, where baked goods are amazin!  This is a real family place, owner and his wife and children all work here, its a small deli and it is a CASH ONLY place!  They are very kind people and really appreciate your business. The cannoli looked great but it wasnt until later that evening that we realized these are TOP NOTCH! The shell was crispy and even after having the filling inside they were crispy, no sogginess to be found! They were fully filled and super delicious.  They also make steak sandwiches and a yummy chicken salad we were given a sample of.  Thanks again Joe!

Really disappointed in the food and the service.  I have been to other locations and they were really good.  I had a shrimp trio and the shrimp were very small and lacked flavor.  The asparagus had huge trunks and were very hard.  The service was mediocre, we were a party of 6 and all felt the same about the food and drink.  Scratching this place off our list.

Such a great find!  Horseback riding, jeep tours, cowboy games, check out the stars at night, since you are so far out of the city.   Come for a BBQ, the food, especially the grilled chicken and ribs!  This place is great for private parties and corporate events. The staff is great too! Kind and generous.  Consider this place for a party in your future.

So the last time I was here was July 2006 and now I know why.  The place itself is cute in a very dated way.  The service was very good but the food is nothing to rave about at all.  We ordered a house salad that came out almost as a soup because of how much dressing was on it, same went for the Chicken Marsala, drowned in sauce you had to search for the chicken.  Ordered a side of penne with oil and garlic, there was so much garlic you could keep vampires away for a lifetime, deeming it inedible, and the pasta was not cooked well either to boot.  The others we dined with seemed to like their food but all complained about things drowning in sauces and lack of real flavors.  With so many options in Tempe and the surrounding area, just go somewhere else for Italian food.

Had a lot of family in town for the holidays, some of us wanted Mediterranean food but not fast Greek food or the like.  I looked at reviews and got recommendations from friends and we decided to try Byblos.  Most of the family had never eaten Middle East, Persian, Greek etc so I was a bit afraid they wouldnt like it.  After they brought out the dolmas and the babba ganoush I knew this was a good place.  They were both delicious and I wish the portions were slightly bigger.  The soup was a tomato soup that was like pizza in liquid form, sooo freakin delicious, even people that dont like tomato soup will like this one!  The lentil soup was also tasty.  We all either had lamb or chicken dishes and everyone enjoyed their dinners.  Dessert was good, the baklava was small but the Honey Pudding was just something that I wish I could have every day!

I dont usually dine at chain restaurants but was with other family member that wanted to eat here.  I liked that I could put our name on the list using my smartphone. Luckily it wasnt busy so when we got there we were seated immediately.  Our server was fantastic, his name was Michael, so personable, helpful and genuine, I want him as a server if I were to go back.  The food was good and the bread was fresh.

Love the food and the people!  Great to come with a group of people and just get huge platter to share.  The lentils, potato and cabbage and collard greens are so tasty.  They even offer gluten free injeera and a gluten free chocolate cake that is amazing.  The ethiopian coffee is sooo delicious I can never pass it up even though it keeps me awake all night.  Its smooth and doesnt need any sugar or cream.  They are opening a store next to the restaurant and you can buy some of their food at Whole Foods.

SOOOOOOO GOOOOODDDD!  Cant say enough about this locally owned gem.  It was super busy both dining in and take out and they close early 8pm and it was already 7pm but we decided to wait anyway.  While waiting I browsed the store and found so many things I wanted to buy! Things that I havent seen since living in NY, like sugar coated chick peas (think Jordan Almonds) and Rose Water which I use to make lemonade and you can order direct off their menu!  So yummy.  The food was fresh and the prices super reasonable. The hummus was fresh and tasty and the chicken kabobs with salad and rice delicious, the dressing on the salad was awesome.

I used to go to Fuddruckers back in Texas in the 80's when they still had the butcher and you could even get bones to take home to the dog.  This place is always busy and the burger is good but the customer service is so awful it is not worth the aggravation of coming here when  you can get a good burger elsewhere.  They got my order wrong then basically argued with me when I wanted it corrected.

I think this place was built in the 70's and never redone.  Its kinda dingy and lacking equipment but is close to home.  Needs a total makeover but I dont see it happening, even though they raised their rates saying its so the clubs can be worked on.  Staff is nice enough

Not sure if they changed bakers but I used to come for their scones, they were HUGE and flaky and for the price just GREAT.  Went there the other morning and they were small, heavy and barely edible, in fact so much so that I threw mine away.

This is an old 1913 bungalow in downtown Phoenix and has a great patio. I can't say enough about this place, the food is amazing and so is the service.    The fresh burrata is so light and creamy, the fresh savory zeppole OMG, lets just say I could just eat those and burrata and be happy.  The homemade pasta and pizza are very tasty with great sauces and toppings.    Make sure you are prepared for on street metered parking or using the complimentary valet as long as its not full.

Was an impromptu dining visit and did not have a reservation but we were greeted quickly and told of our seating options without a reservation, we opted to done outside on the patio since it was a nice evening, we were given a table along the canal and it was perfect.  Our server was also fantastic!  We decided to do the AZ Restaurant Week menu as the options were just perfect for what we were looking for.  The fresh bread and pesto that were brought to the table was delicious.  The bacon wrapped dates were amazing, and not a small portion  either. I had the white bean and kale minestrone and it was also very good. For dinner we had seared scallops over a sweet corn and asparagus, and bacon wrapped pork tenderloin with fingerling potatoes and swiss chard.  The scallops were cooked great and the corn and asparagus very tasty.  The pork was cooked to perfection, moist and melted in your mouth with the smokiness of the bacon just yummy.  For dessert we chose the chocolate mousse and apple crisp.  The mousse was a perfect size and not too sweet.  The apple crisp was a bit disappointing, it was extremely soupy, which our server also recognized but said there was no manager to tell.  Over all a great evening.

This is close to home and was here once before so decided to try it again.  This time was not so great.  The food was super salty, the onion soup had so much salt it was almost inedible.  The fish sandwich was not good, fishy taste and loaded with so much sauce had to scrape most of it off.  Most likely wont go back.

Came for NYE, it was very busy and we sat a little later than our reservations but we were able to sit at the bar for a bit.  Once seated the service was outstanding, it was a crazy busy night and the staff all worked very well together.  The food was very good, although the ceviche appy was very small and in my opinion not worth getting, the others dining with me had the soft shell crab and they were delicious.  The Hot and Sour soup was a bit spicy but so tasty.  The entrees all great as well.  We were all given $20 to return in the next few weeks, we will go back for sure to take advantage of that.

Terrible....you can never see the actual doctor, the turnover is incredible and makes you wonder why.  I arrived at 220 for a 240 appointment, people who had come in after me had been seen and by 3pm I went to the front desk to ask what was going on. When she came back she said the MA was having computer trouble!!! Seriously?  You make me wait bc your computer isnt working?   I went in trying to see the person I had been seeing only to find they had left and I was seeing someone new.  After sitting with me for about 6 minutes she basically said I cant help you and to find another doctor!!!!  WTH

This place needs a MAJOR remodel!  The seating area is just gross, benches and seats ripped and dirty.  No one to clean the tables, the night we went it was a mess!  The food was ok but if the dining area isnt clean, it makes me think the back area isnt either! Table next to me had an issue with their food and had the manager refund them.  I used to be a big fan and I do like other locations, this one needs work.

Being from NY I have an attitude towards pizza I get ANYWHERE else.  Im not tawking about artisanal pizza, but unadulterated NY pizza, big slices that you fold over and let the oil drip off of type of pizza.  This place has the best NY style pizza in the valley as well as very humble and gracious owners who welcome every single person into their establishment, ask your name, how did you hear about us and here try our food!!!!  Who does that?  My answer to that is EVERYONE should do that but they dont take the time.  Even on a busy Friday or Saturday night you are still welcomed because they care.  When you return they remember you, even if its a couple of weeks later.  They have great lunch specials too, that include: pizza, pasta, sandwiches for a very reasonable price.  Try this place you wont be disappointed.

Been coming here since they opened and were just a small coffee shop, now they have a great variety of things to shop for while you wait for your food or drink.  The food is so good, you cant really go wrong with anything you order.  The breakfast burrito is tasty and HUGE.  The pastries are yummy too.

Found this place on Yelp so decided to give it a try.  You can easily see the noodles being made through the window from the dining room, looks like fun :)  Had read about the pot stickers (aka dumplings) so ordered those and I have never seen dumplings this big before, full of delicious meat filling. Also got the green beans which were crisp and fresh cooked with garlic.  The Hong Kong buns are like having a little dessert before the meal, lightly fried pillows of dough dipped in a sweet sauce, so good.  For the main dish and trust me after all the other stuff hardly had room, but ordered the stir fried chicken and wide noodles.  Very tasty big portion.  Have enough leftovers for another full meal for 2!!!!

I would give this 0 stars if it would let me.  Office staff is terrible,  nasty attitude and a general don't give a crap. Arrived at 1pm with forms already completed,  50 minutes later i find out he is running an hour behind,  and I can choose to wait or leave. If this doctor didn't come highly recommended and I hadn't already waited a month for an appointment I would have left.  Hopefully the other offices aren't this bad.

Great service, great food!!!  Cant say enough good things about this place. They have a nice bar area, with music each night and a happy hour from 4-7p. It can be a loud place so if thats not your thing you may want to skip it.  Dining room wasnt as loud and we were able to enjoy the music from the bar in the distance. We ordered fresh oysters first, then had crispy shrimp and lobster bisque both of which were very good, the shrimp had a nice crunch and slightly spicy. For dinner it was a Chilean Sea Bass and the Florida Grouper, OMG the serving size of the sea bass was incredible and it was cooked to perfection in an amazing soy broth that I could just drink up!  The grouper also cooked perfectly and was just as delicious.  Dessert was the butter cake with bananas flambe and a fresh raspberry sorbet with homemade cookies, the sorbet was great but had a ton of seeds which was a slight turn off. The peanut butter cookies were amazingly light and delicious.  The butter cake is very sweet and should be shared!

The great thing about this place is the food, which is why we keep going back.  The Pho is really quite good especially with the grandma sauce, the rolls are very fresh as well. The not so great thing here is the parking and the service is severely lacking.  This place is small, so even when it is busy, it shouldnt be un-manageable. Yet, we wait to get our order taken, the servers forget you are there, forget you ordered a drink, need more water or even a spoon! Will we go back, yes but we already expect poor service.

A beautiful Saturday late morning in Tempe calls for patio dining! Wanted breakfast and NCOUNTER was still serving, even got parking across the street, so it was meant to be!  Step inside to a very crowded restaurant, but the line to order moved very quickly.  My dining partner and I were having trouble deciding between the benedict, omelette and just plain ol' bacon and eggs.  We both ended  up going with 2 eggs over medium, bacon, toast and potatoes.  We found a great seat on the patio and waited for our food to come while enjoying the perfect weather and people watching. When the food came my dining partner had burnt toast, but that was quickly remedied and all was well.  It was a lot of food and it was delicious, eggs cooked perfect, I realized I should have ordered crispy bacon but it was good nonetheless because cmon its BACON!  They have a bar and offer Bloody Marys and Mimosas which I saw plenty of people enjoying.

Had family that was going to a show at the Chandler Arts Center, so we wanted something close by that was nice. Chose this place off of Google Map and so glad we did.  The hostess was friendly and had our table ready and waiting with ice water already set up.  Our server Axel was very friendly and helpful with choosing drinks and food.  We started with the happy hour brie for $5 which is very small but very good, I would say only shareable if you are getting something else. We also tried the bruschetta board which almost every restaurant has these days.  The toppings we chose were delicious and the bread was good but a little too thick for my liking. For dinner I had the Ahi Tuna topped with a homemade kimchi over what I can only describe as rice patty heaven!!!  I also tried one of the salads which had pistachios, banana chips and dried papaya I think, either way it was also really delicious.  Its a great place to sit and have some bites and wine or for dinner.  They have a small patio with a long table that looks like fun with a larger party and cooler weather.

This is the place to go for wings.  That is all they do here and they do them well. Its a walk up and order or call in kind of place.  The people who work here are very nice and helpful and will let you try the different sauces, tell them is your first time and they give you a couple of wings to try. Their  signature rub is the ATL and is very good.  Now these are not cheap wings you pay a little more but the size of the wings are worth it.

The owner/manager of this so called Spa is awful, lacks basic customer service skills.  Cares only about the money, and if you dont become a member treats you like crap.  Even after meeting me MANY times, acts as if she has seen me for the first time when I come in.  Cancelled my membership, this is just another Massage Envy but WORSE. Some of the front desk staff are very nice, too bad the manager is NOT.

What a cool find, stopped in after dinner and was pleased to find live music, coffee, tea and a full bar too!  There are some sofas to relax on as well as tables, there is also a patio and a drive thru.    The drink options are plenty, ranging from coffees to smoothies to tea.  I chose the Mexican Coffee which was really tasty.  Another person in our group got a frozen drink called the Grasshopper which was like a liquid thin mint, YUMMM.  We found out it was open mic night and there was a lot of people waiting to perform. There were some great performances too.  We originally sat at a table and we were in the mood to chat which got us some pretty harsh looks so we moved outside to the patio.    Will definitely come back again

Love that there is a healthy drive through/walk up option for a quick salad, smoothie or soup.  They have breakfast options as well which is handy if you happen to be near a location and need to pick something up.  The summer menu has gazpacho which is very tasty! They always have a Strawberry Kale Smoothie on the menu as well as a special smoothie and salad.

Mondays is Ladies Day, so it saves you money on the lane rental. You can try as many guns as you want and all you need to buy or bring is ammo, ear plugs and eyewear or you can buy there. The range masters are good, they are there to help you and dont mind giving you pointers.

Came here because I had a gift certificate.  It is in a location that you would normally pass right  by while driving but dont! This place has a great patio, it is dog friendly too, the staff was nice and they have great specials. Monday night was a bottle of wine and Smores for $20 which is a great deal.  We had a bruschetta board and while it's kind of annoying that EVERYONE is doing these boards now, I have to say it was very good.  We also had a Madera Burger and this was NOT just a burger, it was cooked perfectly, the toppings all delicious and even the bun was good.  This is a place we will definitely come back to with the dog for brunch on the weekend.

So disappointed....Been to the location in Phoenix and it was so great, everything from the staff to the food, not here in Gilbert.  Went in late last night about 10:40pm the posted hours are open until 12am so figured we had plenty of time.  We were greeted and sat immediately. While we were given water and had drink order taken at 1045 pm we were told it was last call for the kitchen and to hurry and order. We ordered Guacamole, and each ordered 2 tacos, we also requested pico since the salsa that came with the complimentary chips were too spicy for our taste.  The pico was awful it came out warm and tasted off but since we placed the order we have not seen our server, he was cleaning and getting ready for closing, plus it wasn't busy. The tacos were good but that's really all I can say.  Had I never been before it would be my last, its my last time at this location, I may try Phoenix again but not anytime soon.

When looking for healthy dining options, this is always a go to. I try to order a different thing each time but the Thai Chicken Bowl is just too great.  Get it with the sweet potato hash and you get a great meal.  They offer breakfast options as well as salads and sandwiches.  They also offer fresh juices and protein smoothies as well as fresh lemonade and iced teas.  The seasonal lemonade yesterday was a blood orange lemonade but it was very sweet.  I also love the coconut chia pudding as a treat!

I am mixed about this place.  The manager was very nice but the service was not good, on a Thursday night there were only 2 servers and we had to constantly go seek out the server.  The food was good depending on what you had, the carnitas dip was very tasty, the pig wings also very yummy. The pretzel was not so good and the Caesar salad was not good either.  Almost every beer that 3 people at the table tried to order was out and thats pretty bad when you are saying you are a brewery.  The atmosphere is neat, with birds in cages around you.  There was a good Jazz group playing as well.

Love this place!!!  The service and the food and the drinks are top notch!  The Fig & Ginger mule is one of my favorites, with Spring 44 Vodka, figenza fig, lime, pomegranate and ginger beer!!!  The food is just as great too with many choices.

I live close by and was looking for a new groomer, there was also one of those deal discounts so I thought we would give it a try.  The staff is great, very friendly, and communicate well.  I love that the dogs are not locked in kennels when waiting to be groomed, they can be outside and playing. My dogs LOVED being there, they also have daycare which is very affordable and they will send you pictures of your four-leggeds playing.

My first time here,  was craving healthy and Greek/ Mediterranean food, searching Yelp led me here in my own backyard so close yet never been here.  It was pretty busy at 630 pm on a Sunday night and only the owners working as their only employee had the night off  (I told them that is why they were so busy) anyway after looking at the menu for a few minutes I chose the chicken kabobs, which came with a salad and rice or hummus, pita is extra .99c  The wife was cooking a ton of food by herself and when mine came out it was cooked perfectly.  The salad dressing tastes like a dill vinegrette so darn tasty I could have drank it. The homemade hummus and tzaziki were also delicious.   The owner gave me a dessert on the house because of my long wait, which was so kind and not necessary.  Overall great experience and I'll be back to support this mom and pop.

Been coming to La Famiglia since 2004 they recently moved to this location and maybe they are now too big because the service was AWFUL and the food not nearly as good as it was when they were a small local place.  Very disappointing

We came here as a recommendation from a friend. We were not disappointed,  JD was great,  he was friendly and very funny,  We even got to watch movies while we sat in the massage chairs. This place has 6 nail stations and 6 pedi stations. The prices are very reasonable too.

I've been a fan of this place since 2008, I moved away a couple of years ago and missed the food. They just opened this new location close to home. I'm surprised it wasn't busier although it was a Monday night. The food is still very good but prices are higher but they are everywhere these days and I say it's worth it for fresh healthy "faster" food. The staff is friendly and helpful. I hope this place does well and stays in the area fire a long time. Download their app and get free items.

Locally owned, this family knows how to make someone want to eat oatmeal.  They have so many varieties, but my favorite is the protein powerhouse mixed with warm coconut oil.  Ask for a sample, they give great suggestions on what to get and you must try a pancake made out of their mix.  Not only a breakfast place, you can get some pretty tasty burgers too, these are not just any veggie burger, they put their mix in the burger along with other yummy items. Try the Islander with grilled pineapple.  They have a nice area to sit and enjoy your food. I always sit at the bar and chat with the owners and staff, they are so friendly and make you feel welcome.

AWFUL!  Nice atmosphere although very dark.  Had a nice band playing Thursday night and that was the best part of this place. We came here because we had a gift certificate, more on that later; We walked in and there is no one to greet you, we walked around the restaurant to seek someone out and we were told to just find a place to sit, well the table we chose was filthy, so we sat and waited for the server to come. When the server came over we showed her the table to which she said oh Ill get a rag to clean that up and asked for our drink order, the drinks were priced around $12 so I can see why happy hour would be more popular.  The food menu is so small that I can't imagine anything filling you up here.  Apparently this place is just for drinks and small bites NOT A MEAL.  We ordered the brussel sprout appetizer, the fish and chips and a wedge salad, but we wanted a protein on it so we asked for chicken.  What we got was fish that was so covered in batter I had to take it apart to see if there was any fish inside and how can you mess up fries?  The truffle fries were awful, the wedge salad came out and was drenched in dressing and not even a wedge, the chicken we asked for were 2 small fried pieces of chicken.  We also did not have utensils to eat with so the server comes over to say she forgot to put the brussel sprouts order in and that she will buy them for us and bring them out soon, she asks how everything is and we say well we dont have anything to eat with, she says Ill bring utensils over, she turns away and instead of immediately going to get us utensils she goes to the table next to us then proceeds to have a lengthy  conversation with them and even sits down! We got the timer on our phone out to time how long it took to get eating utensils, and it was 5 minutes! My dining partner tries the salad and it really was bad, by this time we have had it, she comes over we tell her this food is awful, we have this certificate and we just want to know what we owe you because we are leaving, she says dont worry about it, keep the certificate and come back another time to which we said, heres the certificate keep it, we will never be back.  We ended up at the Cafe Forte next door which was wonderful.

Came in to try the new evening menu. Tried the Truffle Mac and Cheese for $5.95.  It is pretty good considering where you are getting it from but it is on the small side.  Good for a snack along with their other new items on the evening menu.  The place was very busy and the service was good.

It was my first time here, it was a quiet Monday evening inside the restaurant.  The atmosphere is nice, and the menu is a mix of Quesadillas, Salads, Sandwiches and Soup.  They had a pretty good drink list, I ordered a Riesling that was $6 and was pretty good.  They had 3 soup options, we ordered 2 of them, a vegetable beef and the Bean and Ham, both were very tasty and a bowl was $5.  For dinner they have Soup and Salad options, which is nice, I ordered the BLTA and it looked great when it came out however the foccacia bread it was on was pretty bad, I ended up with a BLTA salad.  My dining partner had a Tinos salad with beets, hazelnuts, goat cheese and chicken which cost an extra $3.  We will likely go back but I wont order the sandwich again, they have pretty interesting salads, so I will go with that and the soup.

First time here and I was very happy I stopped.  Its kind of like Chipotle in that you order while you go down the line adding the items you want. You can add anything for the same price.  I tried a wrap with rice and lentils, hummus, chickpeas, tabouli, cucumbers and chicken, it was huge and I could only eat half but it was very good. They have fresh juices as well.  Ill be back for sure

First time here, the decor is nice, but the service left much to be desired. Our server seemed less than thrilled to be there, and basically had no personality.  The food was a bit overpriced for breakfast.  The breakfast came with 2 eggs, potatoes and toast, but only 1 slice, for 8.25  The potatoes were spicy, cubed potatoes with poblano peppers.  I asked for jelly for my 1 slice of toast and what came out was a delicious real berry jam of sorts, it was very good.  They have a coffee and pastry area too for walk up and take out.

Came in for HH with a friend. Got there about 430 and was able to find 2 seats at the bar.  They had 1/2 off wine and beer and sides. We were able to sit for a few hours without being bothered even though it was getting busy, which was nice. We did order a turkey burger and a side of loaded fries that were ridiculously good!  The service was kind of slow and the bartender was hard to get a hold of but overall it was a good experience and we will be back!

The Tempe location is my favorite, food is consistently good and the service is just as good.  The pretzel and provolone fondue is a MUST have, I like the selection of meats and cheeses, the fried chicken and the wings are fantastic.  So many drinks to choose from, I had the classic mule and another one with bourbon and cabernet, yes BOTH and it was delish!

Brand new and looks great! Great patio!  Start with the Pancake Flight and share with your table.  Try the pineapple upside down pancake for sure.  The breakfast sammie "sandwich I am" is on a fresh pretzel bun and they will prepare to your liking if you are not in the mood for it as is.  The variety of eggs benedict are extensive and they are tasty, the best part is you can mix and match them so that makes decision making a bit easier.  Try the Chili Verde and the Late Harvest.  No bike racks yet but there are some down the street. If that is something you are interested in, tell the management, the more demand the better.

I am not going to sugar coat this review, it was an awful experience. I had been going to their former location for many years and loved it, decided to try the new place out on a Sunday afternoon and here is how it went: We were greeted by a young man and told it was a 20 minute wait, although there were many open tables. We took a look around at the new digs, not bad. We sat on a couch and waited about 8 minutes for our table to be ready, when our name was called we were taken to a 2 seat table in the middle of the restaurant by the front door, we asked if we could take a table further back and we were told they were reserved, ok fine, not 5 minutes later a couple and a baby came in and asked to be seated and were seated in the booth we requested with no reservation.  Our server was also not good, not attentive at all, we sat for a long time before he took our order and then again waiting for water and waiting for the check.  The food is ok at best and overpriced, the salad ended up being $17 because we wanted chicken added and it was not worth it at all, just a bowl stuffed with lettuce and not much more.  It is a shame that the service is so poor and the price for salad pretty outrageous, as this is a FORMER favorite and we will not be back.

First time here was on a Wednesday evening during happy hour.  I was lucky to find parking close by which was a great start to the evening.  Upon entering you cant help but notice the sunken bar and the great light fixtures, which made it bright but not in a bad way.  They have tvs everywhere and when you are sitting in a booth you always have a great view.  The patio is large and dog friendly and with tvs so you can watch the big game.    The Happy Hour is really quite amazing for an Old Town Scottsdale location.  $5 Burger and a side, 1/2 off all appetizers AND salads, $3 beer and well drinks from 4-7!!!  The menu has a great variety of bar food and also healthier options which I really appreciate.  We tried the popcorn which is made with bacon fat and has crisp bacon pieces throughout, OMG so good.  The house made red pepper hummus and veggies was delicious, slightly chunky and really fresh veggies.  The wings looked good but I didnt try them.  I had a Bevvy Salad which had chicken, goat cheese dates and the freshest pieces of avocado I have ever had at a restaurant.  It was large enough to share and at $7 a real bargain and very yummy.  They offer weekend brunch with mimosas and bloody marys and a variety of dishes for $10 each, I am looking forward to trying it out.  There are 2 large Jenga games, a large Connect Four, a mini shuffleboard and a photo booth in the back of the restaurant as well.  The owner, Lauren, is very kind and you can just tell she loves her restaurant and cares what each patron thinks good or bad, so say hi when you go in!  Looking forward to coming back many more times and bringing friends.

I am a huge fan of Boba and always looking for a great place. Tea Street opened a couple of months ago, I got a coupon in the mail so I decided to give it a try. They are from California (they know boba) and they have a huge menu of drinks including their signature top 10 which only comes in a large size for $4.68 and that includes toppings so thats a great deal.  I have had the Pink Rose (Rose petal drink with strawberries, basil seeds and rainbow jelly) which is just so darn good with a lot of toppings included, although the first time I went the owner put boba in at no charge and the second time I went I was charged, (different person and not on the menu) I am guessing it was a kind gesture.  I have also had the Like! Green which has Matcha Green tea and sweet red beans and boba more like a meal, and the Sunshine perfect which is very light refreshing.  My only complaint is that the first few times I went the boba was very fresh which I love and this last time I went I knew it was not fresh which is disappointing.  They offer a buy 10 get one free using the Perka app.

Been going to see Tai and Q for over 3 years now and that says alot.  When you are someone who gets their nails done religiously you have expectations and requirements that are non negotiable.  I want someone who wont drill my nail beds until I bleed, I always prefer hand filing but that is super time consuming so if they must use the drill they MUST be gentle and these guys are super gentle. This place is clean and it is not just a chop shop.  These guys are SUPER SUPER talented in nail art, so if you like to have designs and such these are your go to guys.  Their prices are on par with other salons in the area and remember, you get what you pay for.  Check out their IG pages and see for yourself the talent they have, qt_nailsbymales and tq_nailsbymales   I would suggest making an appointment over just walking in as they get busy.

Love coming here for my fish taco, fried clam fix.  The fried clams are just so good, not all batter and its a big order.  I also ordered the fish sandwich this past visit.  It was HUGE! It can be shared with another person for sure.  The fish tacos, shrimp tacos are excellent and the staff is really nice.  Dining inside is sometimes hard because it is a small space, but worth the wait.  They have a nice patio with a fan and misting system, so its not to bad to sit outside.  They also serve alcohol, I tried the sangria but didnt care for it.

I really like having fast healthy places to eat on the go.  This is a great addition to the Tempe Marketplace.  They have a ton of options for salad, soups and juices. You start by walking to the front and telling the staff what you want, you then go down the line adding or taking away things you want. Ask to taste dressings or spices, they have a lot to choose from. It can be a little pricey when you add larger sizes, drinks, soup etc. but at least its healthy.  They have all natural soda and a variety of fresh brewed iced tea.  Call ahead and pick up for an even faster trip.

This is an update from my first review back in July.  I have gone now 3 more times and I think it may be my last :(  They just are not consistent, especially if I go on  weekend.  This last time I ordered a salad based on the ingredients such as figs, I ordered it, they started to make it, and it wasnt until we got to the toppings part that they told me they dont have figs!!! Well had I known that when I ordered I would have changed my order, my point is, is that the staff should know what they do and dont have so when someone orders they can make a decision on what they want.  They also dont really listen when I asked for the dressing on the side, the girl was so busy worrying about the line of people that she just threw the dressing ON my salad!  I said, I wanted it on the side!  I took it anyway.  Ordered another salad that was supposed to have chicken on it, they forgot to add the chicken!  These are some of the things that will make me not go back.

I had been waiting to try this place since before it opened as I love poutine.  it was a Thursday night and this place wasnt at all busy.  We wanted to try different things so we ordered Pork 3ways, Original, Chicken Fajita and the Beef and Crispy Onion.  The frys were good but there was not much cheese and it had a lot of sauce on the original, the pork 3 ways was tasty as was the chicken fajita but the beef and crispy onions didnt have much beef and the beef was COLD to boot!  When asked why I was told you have to request the beef be hot, well that doesnt make sense to me, I am ordering HOT fries and gravy why would I want cold meat on top!  there was not much beef on top either.  The prices are somewhat high in my opinion for what you get.  I would not go out of my way to come back, but may go back if I was in the area and wanted poutine.

New location opened in Tempe at Rural and Baseline, its actually located in a former McD's but you wouldn't know it by walking inside. They have a nice long bar area and the dining area is large and open. The menu is huge and varies between chinese, thai and other asian fusion.  They have lettuce wraps that are delicious and the Pad Thai, Pork Lo Mein and Shrimp in Lobster sauce are all good choices.  Go in for Happy Hour or on Saturdays when the menu is $6 from noon - 3!  Such a deal.

Had been meaning to try this place and so glad I did.  They have a great sausage and pepper sandwich that I get each time!  The onion rings are so tasty, crispy and not greasy.  They have chicken sandwiches, Halibut sandwich which is also good.  They also have extensive salads and the best thing is that when you get one to go, they package the toppings separately so the salad doesn't get wilted.  Reasonably priced with a drive through, so what are you waiting for!

Love the drinks here but the food is also very good, I know this is a seafood place but you have to try the brisket at least once.  It is not at all dry and is fall of the bone good.  The staff is friendly and they have a great patio area.

Went in last night about 8pm, place was pretty empty but I just dont think many know this place has opened yet.  Staff was very friendly and helpful being our first time.  Everything looked fresh and it was hard to decide what toppings to get, since you can have them all if you want at no additional charge!! We decided on pepperoni, mushrooms and olives and red sauce. It was actually very good.  We also got the cinnamon sticks which is the same dough used for the pizza but smaller and has cinnamon and sugar on top, with your choice of chocolate, strawberry and cinnamon dipping sauce. We didnt have a drink but did look at the homemade lemonade and the Marion Blackberry Lemonade along with regular iced tea and a carmelized pear tea that I wish to try next time.  They do offer salad.....but why ;)

I really enjoy the food although the service is always hit and miss.  Today I had the Anaheim Scramble which is eggs, cheddar, bacon, tomatoes, green onions and avocado.  Comes with potatoes or fruit (I had fruit) and toast for $7.69 +tx.  It was very good and very filling and the fruit was very fresh.  I also had  a mini bundt cake and Hibiscus Lemonade.  Its too expensive to get every day but worth it as a once in a while treat that is tasty too.

I have been a huge fan of Hawaiian Poke for years and always anticipate the next time Ill be able to enjoy the fresh tuna.  My wait was over today when Ahipoki Bowl opened in Scottsdale.  It is a build your own bowl type of place, you start by choosing your base of rice(white or brown) or salad or a mix of half and half.  I chose half white rice and half salad. The greens looked fresh and the rice was hot, although I didnt like my fish on top of that hot rice, next time Ill ask for it off the rice.  Then you choose your fish, there are many choices such as tuna, spicy tuna (which is chopped) salmon, albacore, shrimp, and yellowtail for $1 more, the you choose from 4 different sauces (house, house spicy, creamy spicy and a sweet citrus) I went traditional house spicy which had a nice amount of flavor and a touch of spice. Then you add toppings, they allow you to get every one if you like, I got it all! They are brand new today so be patient with them. Everything was fresh and tasty, I look forward to going again soon.

Can't say enough good things about this place. The atmosphere is cool, the patio is great!  The food is awesome! We came with a large group and the service was phenomenal. Looking forward to coming back and trying the smoked trout appetizer along with some other dishes.  The food was fresh and if this menu doesnt do it for you then try the sister restaurant Becketts Table, also amazing!
