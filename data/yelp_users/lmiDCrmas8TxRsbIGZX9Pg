Awesome sports bar- and this coming from a girl who doesn't even like sports! Came here before a D-back game, and on a couple of Pub Crawls. Each time, the place was packed, yet each time, still got excellent service. Very friendly waitress and bartenders. Drinks came fast and good times were had. Decent menu, similar to other sports bars, lots of burgers and wings. Great choice when your downtown.

Really, really, really, ridiculously good pupusas.  Those of you who have never tried one before, for the love of all that is holy man try one!   Tip- rough neighborhood, may want to strap on a bulletproof vest before coming down.  Tip- entrance is in the back

TexAZ Grill is a low key hidden gem in Phoenix.  It's location is modest, its decor is eccentric, very Texan inspired, and the size of the restaurant is fairly small.  The portions however are not so small.  I went for Brunch and of course I had to try the chicken fried steak everyone raves about. I was not disappointed in the CFS, just as the man other yelpers state, it is Indeed very good. Not made of the usual ground beef type of meat, it was more of an actual deep fried thinly pound steak.  What also came as a surprise, was how much I enjoyed the side dishes. The gravy was amazing, as were the biscuits and if your thirsty, may I suggest the Turlingua Sunrise. I cannot wait to come back and try a big juicy steak.  God bless Texas!

This was so much fun! My girlfriend and I called last minute, and they were able to squeeze us in for an ATV tour that day. We met up at Four Peaks location, got the rundown, signed the forms & threw on our helmets and off we went into the desert.  The location was gorgeous, and we were free to drive the atvs at a good pace, we had such a blast I'd highly recommend this tour if in town and looking for something fun to do. Fun for all ages. Good spot for camping too.  Be careful out there though.  There are people camping in the area, and I also saw a random guy shooting in the desert right by the atv trails.

It's like a non-country, trendier version of Cracker-Barrel. Cute, cozy, filled with nicknack's and plenty of charm. On the downside, it can get a bit crowded, and there is not much parking, but overall- it's a nice local spot  with plenty of delicious goodies to try.   Tip- lots of good wine to choose from!

Wow, looks like this makes review #700 for Postino's! I'm sure by now you all have heard of the great Monday night deal which includes a bottle of wine and their yummy bruschetta, and it doesn't really matter what kind of bruschetta you get, because its all delicious so they are all good choices. Other than the good monday night deal, this is simply just an overall cool little quaint spot to spend a couple hours, especially great for a date. It's dark, and intimate, nice baby-making music playing in the background...   Not too many drawbacks I can think of other than parking being limited, and since it is a fairly small location, it can get crowded quick. Oh, and I must confess I did find it just a smidgen on the hipster side, but not enough to keep me away thats for sure.

Very efficient and quick way to keep your car clean. I got the fast pass from groupon. The deal I got is gone, BUT check in with Yelp app, and unlock a FREE 1 month pass for unlimited exterior car washes!  Start up was a bit long, but once I was set up, its been a breeze to pull in and access the car wash. And did I mention this location has a Dunkin Donuts inside? Score!!!!!

Excellent service. Even though the guy working out front is a lil youngin, he thoroughly explained their services and prices (which are very affordable) they offer fast service, did a good job on my clothes, and I even got a phone call thanking me for trying their service and gave me a coupon to use for next time. Now that's customer service ya'all! Only drawback is that I was hoping the do alterations which they dont, but they did recommend a nearby place that could help me. I found my new dry cleaners!

Went last night for ladies night, and very pleasantly surprised. First of all, you can't beat 50 cent drinks and no cover. It's not as scary inside as it looks outside. The staff- so awesome, and friendly! Good music, but then again I'm a GINORMOUS country fan, so I'm a little biased. They also make it fun with contests and giveaways. I really can't find anything sucky about this club. There was a good amount of hotties there too!  Oh, and did I mention-50 cent drinks!  5 stars for you Whiskey River, you got yourself a new regular!

One word sums this place up. GHETTO! The other reviews were right on the money. I'm not gonna lie, I was scarred! So I suggest buying your tickets ahead of time to get the best rate. I also highly suggest paying the extra 5 bucks to get priority seating and sit up front. And watch your seat- if you leave it empty, you will get jacked. Be forewarned- people stink! Apparently other passengers don't believe in showers or deodorant. A can of Lysol may help. I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because the bus did arrive to destination on time both times I used the bus, and the second driver was very cool and funny.

Used to live & work right by this place, so I would come regularly. Sometimes the food was a bit garlic-y, but other than that, I was never disappointed by the food here. The service was fast & friendly. The portions were just right, and it seems like their food is made healthier than other Thai places I've been to. I LOVE hot spicy food, and they actually challenged my palette a time or two. So let it be know, if you ask for something very spicy, they will give it to you!

I feel like they try to "up-sell" way too much here.  My boyfriend was quoted almost $300 for a pair of glasses that were seriously a fraction of the cost when we went somewhere else. I got an overall very unprofessional vibe here, the staff was rude and a bit on the ghetto side. Sorry, but not a fan.

Not a fan for the following reasons:  1.  Overcrowded, and difficult to find decent parking, and long lines/wait time 2.  They would not seat my girlfriend until I arrived.  It was just the 2 of us having dinner, I found this SO rude! 3.  Dirty,  and not in the "eat your peanuts & throw them on the floor" kind of way, our table only had a quick wipe down, and the booths were a mess with food and crumbs all over the place, I had to wipe down myself with a napkin before sitting.  4.  It would be nice to be able to order some drinks when you are seating instead of being told "oh, you can order drinks when your waitress comes, not from me (super annoyed by this point).  5.  They "ran out" of the dish my friend ordered.  Had to choose something else.  Salad had too much dressing on it.  My prime rib was just ok.  Nothing more nothing less however I did not like the prime rib au jus tasted like it had barbecue sauce in it or something.    On a lighter note, here are a couple positives: 1.  Fair prices 2.  Good portobello chicken- very juicy and flavorful. 3.  Good early dinner specials, 11 choices for 9 bucks  That is all.

Had a great time at Kona last couple times I've gone so am updating my review. Service was very friendly, and got good feedback from waitress when I asked for suggestions. They have a new coconut Mojito that is to die for. There was no wait, we were served promptly and the food got to our table surprisingly fast. The food was really light, and healthy, veggies cooked just right.  Seems like a great place for happy hour too. Good job Kona!

I've lived in the area 4 months now, and today I saw a different side of Scottsdale. I hadn't realized what a family friendly area it is. I came to the park to walk my pup and found this park full of families, bbqs, bday parties, teenagers playing volleyball, parents playing with their youngsters on the playground, a group of smiling children riding a train, a carousel, just enjoying the beautiful day with their loved ones.  It's almost enough to make a girl want to run out and start a family of her own!  Seriously though, like the other Yelpers stated, this is a very nice and inexpensive  way to spend the day with your loved ones. Really reminded me of my own childhood- before we were all glued to our electrical devices and actually had human interaction.

You can't really go wrong with Flemings. Very romantic, and dark inside. You get what you pay for, and here, you pay ALOT. Portions are small, but thats kind of a good thing if you ask me. Service is top notch and so is flavor. Came with my mom & we both had the Restaurant week specials. I went with the Chicken & Mom got the Steak.  Both were incredible.  My only regret was not getting the Chocolate Lava cake. This is a must at Flemings- Deelish!

This is a lovely place to stay in N. Scottsdale. Its very quiet & peaceful. The rooms are very spacious and you can tell right off the bat, these are condo's not hotel rooms. Has a sink, fridge, large bathtub, lots of extra pillows, 2 tv's, a separate bedroom area, and a patio. All that for 70 bucks a night (from hotwire) What a steal!  The staff here gets 6 out of 5 stars. They all go out of their way to provide the best service. The only negatives here would be that there's no sit down restaurants on the resort, and at night, its so dark by the golf area- kinda spooky. Tip- in the summer, go to pool at night. It's really pretty full of lighted palm trees.

Oh Handlebar J's where have you been all my life? This place is very authentic- real country, very unique. There's not a lot of places like this in Scottsdale. Good live music, there's a lot of two stepping going on. It's very warm and friendly, and humble yet it's nicer than a dive.  So we got here Friday at midnight, and were very warmly greeted. It was late,  yet they still served us food. (it's no 4 star dining so don't expect a fancy menu). I just loved our waitress who was very down to earth, funny & very attentive.

Nice little local hole in the wall authentic Thai restaurant. Good lunch specials that run around $7.95 to $9.95. Our waitress was a total sweetheart too. I recommend the Pad Se Iew, the Thai Iced Tea, and any of the fried rice dishes.   Tip -don't ask them to make your dish "spicy" unless you can take it because they are not messing around with their chile!

I love Goldies! Its like the "Cheers" of Scottsdale, but everybody doesn't know my name there yet.  Gotta try the Goldaritas. Great place for happy hour, and to watch a game. Can get crowded, hard to find a seat at the bar.   Tip- pretty decent buffalo wings

Dang- worlds strongest margarita here! Most people don't know they even serve Margs here. I always thought they were wine margs but the guy who made mine says they are made with actual tequila. I ordered 1 and I thought I got roofied it was so strong. Anyhoo- good service, good food, good prices and good chill location- not too many people at all.

Word on the streets was was that Lox Stock & Bagel was a really good local breakfast/lunch spot, so when I saw a groupon deal I though I would give it a try.  Upon entering, I was happy to find there was   not a long line, and the inside was larger than I had expected, you can actually sit and have a nice comfortable lunch here.   Unfortunately the groupon for some reason was not working, nor would they honor the deal, but I will let that slide because the service was fast and friendly. There was a large variety of bagels, cream cheeses, and fillings. I opted for the cheddar jalapeno bagel with ham, eggs, and cheese.  It was large, with a good portion of ham, a soft tasty bagel, all put together very neatly so was not difficult to eat.  I was also pleased to find decent hot chocolate here, not too watered down like I find at other places, and I requested it with caramel- YUM YUM YUM.  Had to update to a well deserved 5 stars after trying their breakfast burrito.  Came with eggs, cheese, potatoes, bacon and ham.  It was like I died and went to burrito heaven.  Hands down best breakfast burrito in town.

Pretty dayum good pizza. Not very fast but i thought the food was worth the wait. Try the itallian sausage. I also suggest the Bellini. I was debating giving 5 stars because I found the place quite charming, nice chill outdoor patio, but my date was upset the bathroom was out of papertowells and I didn't like the fact there was only 1 stall in the ladies room in patio. But overall, I will definitely love to come back again.

To say I was excited to see a Ray's out here for the first time would be an understatement. It's not as good as the Ray's in Manhattan, but it's damn close enough for me.  I love these "pizza-by -the-slice joints. I hate when I'm craving pizza, but I don't want a whole pizza. So it's a good place for lunch, or to grab a quick slice if pizza. Fair prices and it's run by some real New Yorkers.  Tip- go with the freshest looking pizza

Felt a connection with this lively, positive-energy filled Church since the first time I went about 5 weeks ago. Haven't missed a service yet. Couple weeks ago the Pastor mentioned that listens to 2 types of music, Country & Western- haha, now that's my kind of Pastor! Lots of opportunity to volunteer and serve in their ministries. The sermons are honest and give you that unbeatable wholesome happy feeling when you leave. Great community to be a part of.

Very cool location, awesome views, awesome service, and I actually didn't pay for valet so not sure why others stated they did.  The drawbacks.... It's expensive, drinks, food and portions were good but not spectacular, and the bar table we sat at was way too small and barley fit our three plates of food.   Tip- chorizo nachos!  Tip- steer clear of the cucumber Marg. no bueno!

I really hate giving bad reviews but between the disgusting floater in the restroom, the view of a bum outside my window, and the food that seemed to all come out of a can or a package, there was no getting around giving a 2 star review. I'm all about checking out hole-in-the walls and mom-n- pops shops, you can find some great gems out there, but this not one of them. It's also odd that you think your going o eat a "country" breakfast, and you see egg rolls on the menu.  I will however, give props to our sweet waitress who was very nice and gave great service. :) other than that- the experience was not so nice

The food here is super good. I recommend the carne asada nachos.  My other main recommendation would be the blended/frozen margaritas. I like coming here for some daytime drinking. Great open patio makes you feel like you are on vacation in Cabo.

Authentic old school saloon. I liked it a lot here. Its a very small bar, but Its got stools, and whiskey at a fair price- thats all I need! Its right in Old Town & when I went, there was more of an older-tourist crowd as opposed to the college young'ins. I swear I also saw the worlds oldest cowboy here- had to be 142 years old.  So if your in a Cowboy chasin--whiskey drinkin kind of mood- check this place out.

I am also surprised at the not too good reviews, I was pleasantly surprised to find an absolutely charming large and inviting patio.  The wait was not too bad for a Saturday night (20 minutes), and the margaritas were quite good (though not on the cheap side).  I love how they have different and very unique flavored hand made tortillas, and oh man, the guacamole? YUMMM! We all went with the steak tacos, and they were really good, loved the marinade they use for the steak. The only downfall I would say was the limited parking but other than that, I am a fan!

Giligans Bar is the spot you want to visit when you feel like partying in Old Town, but lay low at the same time. Girls, no need to break out the 5-inch heels or spend an hour getting ready to come here. Feel free to come COMFY.  Giligans possesses all the benefits of a good dive, like cheaper booze, (in big bottles), comfortable atmosphere, jello shots, games, karaoke, beer pong, a midget bar, lots of funny drink specials(for cougars and people with a breathalyzer in their car)  and an interesting crowd, but it's not a scary dive like the ones filled with Hells Angel bikers. Good happy hour specials too- lots of munches for 3 dollar which include taquitos, fried pizza rolls, and fried zucchini.   Tip- don't drink & drive!

So I made it in to this charming restaurant today, and had to order the famous Stetson salad, and yes, it was very good. Personally, I actually preferred the Testosterone salad, and I think that salad doesn't get nearly enough play. The steak strips were like a little piece of carnivore heaven. So tasty, juicy, and ridiculously tender. Prices were a bit steep. 50 bucks for 2 salads, a glass of wine and an iced tea. Regardless of price, next time I go, I'm SO ordering a big juicy steak.  Great people-watching spot right in Old Town, and the place had cute character.  Nice place to take visitors from out of town.

Bleh, sorry Denny's but I'm not a fan. The food is awful. More times than not, so is the service. I only came here two times for breakfast because the other nearby restaurants had a wait and I was starving. But next time, I think I'd rather start gnawing on my own arm.

So there I was, on a Saturday morning, 8am looking for someone- anyone to take my mangy but adorable Yorkie Miley who was WAY overdue for her grooming/haircut.  I tried 5 other places that morning who were too busy, closing early or wanted her papers (which I didn't have on me at the time). I finally tried Canine Preferred, and they took her in right away, worked with my short timeframe, even had her done an hour earlier than anticipated.  When I came to pick her up, she looked better than she had from any other groomer I've taken to her.  I knew I found my new regular groomer. I was not charged any extra fees, in fact the fee was almost $10.00 less than the other places I was looking at. I won't be going anywhere else. Well done Canine Preferred, I am one happy customer!  Tip- take cash, they did not accept atm when I went, so had to make a run to the bank.

Martini Ranch reminds me of a club in TJ. Its fun, but in a dirty kind of way. Its very large, and great place to dance, there is live music, and a DJ. I've heard everything here from rock and country, to booty-rap & house. So... ya, theres something for everyone.

I'm giving Don & Charlies 5 stars because it is an all around solid steakhouse. Everything I've tried here has been really good, from the shrimp cocktail, to their salads, and of course their big, juicy, tender steaks. But it isn't just good food, management,  servers, and even their valet guys understand what good service is. The owner/managing partner I  met was super sweet, and seemed very down to earth, in fact this whole restaurant is very cool and unpretentious. The prices are not low, but well worth a splurge. Well done Don & Charlies!

I've only been here during Christmas season, the place is so lit up with Christmas lights you can see it over a mile away. It definitely has an old dive-y atmosphere, but who doesn't like a comfortable, quaint little charming bar that serves cheap booze right? Its small inside, but has a good size patio full of heaters, and this place pulls in a decent crowd too. I hear it's the oldest tavern in Scottsdale, I really hope it lasts many more decades.

Holy frijoles- this place lived up to the hype. I'm surprised how how good the pizza is here in Arizona. Very tasty, and definitely some of the best pizza I've had in the valley. The only downside is that there is usually a long wait to be seated, and then once your seated, it takes a longer wait for your pizza. The prices are average, the service was so-so, but the food was excellent! Nice location too, right in Old Town so you can have a drink at a nearby bar while you wait for your table. Cool place for date-night, or to have dinner with family. It's fairly casual, but charming at the same time.

Came with hubby for a romantic weekend getaway and had a great time. Nice grounds, large pool- good for laying out with a margarita in your hand.  Friendly helpful staff, relaxing vibe. The room itself was old fashioned, and could use a little updating, but not a big deal and the rooms are good size.  I'd love to come back again. There are also a lot of restaurants nearby.

This place is cool. It has a lot to offer compared to just a regular restaurant. It's an old western little town with a dirt road, shoppes, and a steakhouse which has live country music. There is also a straight up saloon that makes even the biggest city slicker feel like Clint Eastwood. But wait, there's more! Cowboy sunset cookouts, gunfighter shows and Bull riding! Thats my kind of fun, and still very family friendly.  1 downside- the rocky dirt parking lot. No heels or flip flops- way too much dirt so pull out those Cowboy boots & have fun.

As soon I walked in the door, I was in honky-tonk heaven.  This is a real country bar with great live country music, well sized dance floor for 2-stepping, indoor & outdoor bars, great crowd that is a mix of bikers, cowboys, and locals both young and old just looking to have a good time, and of course the live bull-riding. Yes, anyone with $40 bucks and a death wish can sign a waiver and ride a live bull (Wednesday evenings) For those of us less-adventureous folks, we can watch from the bleachers. Top that off with food sold for $10.00 a pound, and you got yourself one heck of a good time Y'all!   Tip -It's a bit of a drive to get here, as the saloon is located in the city of Cave Creek, so make sure you assign a designated driver.

I just laughed so hard when I saw someone gaVe this place 5 stars. I haven't laughed that much in weeks.Should be called the Crappy Inn.  WOW, ok, so I can honestly say this is by far, without a doubt the worst, ugliest, scariest place I have ever stayed. On a busy 3 day weekend, we were roaming the streets of vegas trying to find a room, anywhere at like 4am, everything was booked, And thats when we found the Happi inn. It seriously looked like a jail cell with brick walls, no window, what appeared to be blood stains on the floor, and a wall air conditioner that shook all night & appeared to be on the brink of falling over right on top of the bed. You couldn't PAY me to stay here again, and this is coming from one cheap woman.  To this day, my friends and I still sit around and laugh at our night at Happy Inn.  Stay away your better off getting arrested & staying the night in jail.

Durants is a great option for a nice dinner or to celebrate a special occasion. I have to say that I enjoyed the look and vibe of this old school, romantic, mobster-ish joint a tad more than I enjoyed the actual food.  Had to go with the prime rib, which was good and large so come with an appetite!  You definitely want to make a reservation but luckily I was able to get in same day (during spring training) So that was much appreciated.   Tip-have a martini!

A small taste of the tropics in North Scottsdale.  A lovely place for dinner, happy hour, or a business lunch. Located in the nice outdoor Kierland Mall. The food here is scrumptious and if you are thirsty, I recommend the Mai Tai.  2nd story is awesome. Top notch service too.

I can't believe I just recently discovered this place.  I just love the outdoor patio bar area. Really good service from the hostess, bartender and wait staff,  our eccentric and energetic waiter sounded just like Joe Pesci.  People this place has happy hour everyday from 4pm until closing! Can't beat that. I suggest the orange chicken. Oh, and take advantage of the Yelp deal when using Yelp App. Ya, you're welcome!

Good carnitas, guacamole, and margaritas. I loved dining on the patio.  Prices are a tad on the higher side than what I am used to paying for the average Mexican restaurant, but overall I give it a solid 4 stars.    Tip- you may want to make a reservation

Can't even count how many different hotels I've been to in Vegas, but this is my very favorite hotel. My numero uno! It's absolutely gorgeous. Has that wow factor. Very luxurious, very romantic, ... very expensive! lol but its worth it. Large rooms, good service and location. Venetian, you never let me down- never disappoint. People, make sure to stay here next time your in vegas. Great for anniversaries, bachelor party weekends, or weekend getaways with your friends.

For a small club/lounge, there sure is a whole lot of hookin-up, and getting-drunk going on in here!  Not gonna lie, I always end up having a great time here (from what I can remember) but it may not be for everyone. Crowd is a bit younger, but worth checkin out if your in the area.

Been wanting to come here since it was featured on Food Networks Diners, Drive-Ins& Dives. Guy Fieri knows good food so this was the first place I thought of when my parents wanted to grab breakfast in Phoenix. Luckily, on a Monday afternoon, we avoided the rush, and only waited 5 minutes! Score! Now on to the grub.  A lot of the food here is locally grown, they use cage-free eggs, and they even make their own jam/preservatives. I loved everything we ordered. Pancakes were different- they are very sweet- no need for any syrup. The hash browns were very good, but very heavy- and a bit soggy (which I actually prefer). The toast is large, freshly baked, and served with real butter. (nothing beats real butter!) My pork chop was very tasty and seasoned just right. Also, our server was a sweetheart, very helpful and patient.   Tip- try the homemade berry lemonade if available Tip- call ahead to find out about the wait- avoid the rush!  Tip- as mentioned in almost all other reviews, this place is very tiny- not a good for large parties or the claustrophobic.

You can't go wrong with Chipotle. This location gets crazy busy at lunchtime! Steer clear at 12pm. I've been going closer to 1 to avoid the zoo.  Parking is limited but it's a nice location.  Tip- order online and skip the line!  Tip- try one of their margs

Too bad I can't bring my dog along- very cool trail. Good workout, lots of people, lots of parking, very central location- super easy to get to.  Bring lots of water, and bring your camera or some great shots.

Love, love, love me some Hawaiian food! I usually go for the trio plate that comes with beef, chicken, and pork, the most delicious macaroni salad and white rice. Bring your appetite when you come here.  Tip- great for lunch- they have 5 dollar plate lunches! Aloha!

One of the good things about living in N Phoenix is being close to DRM. Lol- (half kidding) it's huge. So many options for dinner. My usual spots for HH or dinner are Sandbar and the Keg.  Other usual spots are Target, Khols,, and Total Wine.  Geeze they really do have everything here. It's a bit much though. It's overcrowded with people and cars especially on weekends, but at the same time, I've never had to wait for a table at any restaurant here, which I totally appreciate as patience is not one of this Yelpers virtues. Tip- use your Yelp app to check-in and get specials or deals

This dog park has alot to offer. It's large and spacious with 2 gated sections -one for  "active" dogs, where I see larger pooches,  and one for passive dogs where I see smaller dogs, but some larger ones too.  it's clean, well kept, and inviting. Also a really great place to meet fellow loving dog owners. Even if you just want to walk your dog, there's a nice walking path and desert garden area. I never have an issue with parking either. Just a very pleasant way to spend some quality time with your furry friends.  Tip- make sure to clean up after your pet, or you might get mauled by a group of angry pet parents!

I liked this hotel overall. There was a little room for improvement.  The pros:   great pool with good vibe, good eye candy and good drinks. So if your single, ready to mingle and enjoy laying out, check this place out. The spa was also above average, I had a fairly decent massage. The room is nice, and trader vics was superb!  The cons. This place is as old as Hugh heffners balls, yes yes yes, it's well maintained but its from the 70's and looks like an ugly old motel from outside, Also, some of the staff was complaining about how bad management was, I found this unprofessional and it just doesn't look good when staff isn't happy.  My tip is to check out the website, I bought some package deal for 2 nights, 2 drinks upon arrival, a nice dinner at trader vics,  free breakfast both days and 2 massages at the spa. I forget the exact cost, but it saves lots of money.

Not my favorite spot. It looked promising walking in, there was live music, but too loud so decided to eat inside. Each food and drink  item we ordered was disappointing. This included wings, and some kind of Asian tacos, and a handful of mixed drinks.  Service was pretty bad as well. Our initial server never came back to check on us after our order was taken.  We  had to flag down other servers walking by each time we wanted something. Probably won't be back anytime soon.

This place almost makes you want to BE a dog! The little furry guys seem so happy and joyous jumping into the water fetching balls, running around freely and making new friends. The people here are very friendly and kind. Very family friendly, large, clean, and efficient dog park. Was very fun just to sit back and watch the pooches have the times of their lives.

The Butterfields waffle Sunday made my jaw drop when I saw it. Pretty sure it was love at first sight. So,  I've tried a few different items here, and have not been disappointed by anything. The OJ is good too. This is one the my preferred breakfast joints in Scottsdale, it's cozy, I usually get seated right away, and the service is friendly.   Tip- I like the cheese blintzes

Most Fry's that I have been to are pretty similar to one another, I am giving 4 stars because last time I went, I decided to try some food from their deli, not really expecting much. The lady at the counter was scary. Looked so mean & was quite short, but after I got home & had my first bite of chicken I could have kissed her face! it was effing good.

My first thought when I came here was, I hope the food is worth the wait. And It was.  My fellow yelpers never do me wrong, so I had to go with the California Club and Breakfast Buzz.  Both lived up to the numerous good reviews.  I just loved the Breakfast Buzz's hint of peanut butter flavor. I am pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food considering they have a drive through.  This place is most definitely not your typical fast food restaurant.  If you have not come here yet, give it a try you won't be disappointed.

This place is cool, its not the ritz carlton or anything, but i've been here a few times already and its been a good experience each time. Friendly staff, cute rooms with nice modern decor, soft comfy bed, flat screen tv, they have a pool and its in a decent location. All this for 50-60 bucks- great deal. I get those prices when I use hotwire. One time a called in for a rate & it was like over 130 a night so while this is a cool hotel, I wouldn't pay more than 80 bucks a night.  Also- its right by the park, makes for great sunrise & sunset jogging. :)

Cool little place, very quaint, intimate and relaxing. Perfect place for that glass of wine after work. Nothing fancy or over-the top. I recommend this place for lunch if you work in the area. They have 5.95 lunch specials. The buffalo chicken sandwich is finger-lickin-good  Wine is also half off Monday's- check out the website for other daily specials. I think they also have live music too sometimes.

Cozy, home-like atmosphere, but a bit crowded on weekends which made me feel a bit claustrophobic when I ate inside. Outside seating is good if weather permits. The food was good portion- not too huge, and I found it lighter than say, IHOP or Carrows. I didn't have to unbutton my pants after my meal, so that was good.

Morning Glory Cafe has quickly become my new favorite breakfast spot.  Mainly because of its outdoor, fresh air, country feel.  The grounds make you feel like you are eating right smack in the middle of a working farm.  You can walk around the different areas, even check out gift shop.  There usually is a wait, but luckily it has never been more than 10 or 15 minutes. The tables are wobbly and the ground is hard to walk on in many areas (don't bring your heels or wedges here), but adds to the unique, agricultural yet homey atmosphere.   As far as the food goes, I have tried a few different dishes from the french toast, pork omelet, eggs Benedict, and American breakfast.  They are all delicious, I haven't had anything I did not enjoy. Love the lemonade, and the muffins are house-baked.  Try this place out on one of our many beautiful sunny Arizona mornings.   Tip- bring your furry friends, this is a pet friendly patio. Tip- good location for different group events, from yoga to weddings.

This is a great clothing store. Trendy, and affordable. This is the kind of place you stop by on a friday afterwork to get your outfits for whatever you got going on that weekend. Lots of cute accessories too. I've never come here & left empty handed.

Can't beat the location. Right in old town, walking distance from a ton of great bars/restaruants/clubs so you can easily stumble back to your room after a night of bar hopping drunken-ness. I got a great room rate using hotwire- SCORE! Service- funny & friendly Parking- close to entrance, and free of course (Love you Arizona for that!) Cleanliness- very clean Ambience- very cool, modern, trendy, fun & relaxing. workout area- nice, each elliptical & treadmill had its own tv. They even provide headphones, water, towels, and hand sanitizer. Also had free wifi.  Overall- doesn't suck...doesn't suck at all. I'd love to come back here.

Absolutely amazing hamburgers. Amazing garlic fries. Amazing shakes, fried zucchini, and onion rings. I can go on, or you can read the other five hundreds reviews on this place, its even been featured on Food Network.  Joe's Farm Grill is a great, original, retro, family-friendly restaurant serving fresh organic quality food.  Beautiful outdoor picnic area type seating surrounded by large mature trees, even an outdoor soda machine and condiment station, which is great since so many of us Arizonans just love eating and being outside!. Surprisingly enough, it is not nearly as crowded as I thought it would be. Its not exactly close to home, but there are a few places I always like to swing by when I am in the area- and best believe this is one of them.

Pretty, serene, relaxing and quiet. It is right next to the Zoo & Botanical Gardens. I especially like it during sunset. There are easy novice trails, so I suggest this for those who want more of a relaxing hike or bike ride as opposed to a hardcore workout.

I get the whole "dicks" theme that this place is trying to pull off, and that's why I went to check it out. Expecting the staff to be jerks, but funny jerks.  I am not uptight and can take a joke, but the staff was not funny, just mean, arrogant, rude and gave really bad service. First we were ignored at the bar for 11 minutes, then other bartender didn't even know how to make a simple drink! I didn't mind the bartender referred to me as "titty's" but I was offended I paid 10 bucks for a half-ass drink!

So, I will start by saying that I was expecting the fair to be much much worse.  Mind you, I went yesterday, the day following the big teenage riot. The area does look very scary.  It's a rough neighborhood so be careful where you choose to park. We found close parking for $10, other places were charging $15. There was hardly any line to get in (pleasant surprise #1), we were literally inside within just a couple of minutes. Ladies do need to have their purses checked, so leave your weapons at home (half kidding).    There may have been added security following the violent night before.  Plenty of po-po's all over the place, as well as a specific gang unit, so at no time inside the fair did I feel unsafe. While there was a good amount of people inside, we never had to wait in a line more than a couple of minutes for food, beer, rides, or bathroom (very pleasant surprise #2).  Oh, and let me touch on the bathroom-  I don't know the term for it, but it was so much nicer than a standard porta-potty, it was larger, had lights, running water sink, and get this- an air conditioner! Yes, that would be pleasant surprise #3.   As far as the food, we had to try at least 1 fried item, and decided to go with the deep fried Reese's peanut butter cup, which was interesting. Not bad at all.  Chili cheese fries, beer, and a polish sausage dog with peppers were also on our shameful menu for the night (no judging please).   The fun night ended with a kick-ass country concert (Justin Moore).  The admission is actually free with standard fair admission, though we bought tickets for better seating (only $20). It was well worth it, and the crowd was great. I had heard so many negative things about the fair, and am very glad we decided to come check it out for ourselves.   Tip -take a ride on the ski lift once the sun goes down for a great view!

Came to this hot mess last weekend, and was NOT impressed.  Waited way too long before we received any service. Drinks took forever, ordered a Mai tai and received a glass full of sweet & sour. Not a great crowd, and very rude, disrespectful bouncers. Luckily there is a Saddle Ranch right across the way that ended up saving the night.

So there we were on a Sunday afternoon, knowing I was hungry but not quite sure what I was in the mood for.  So pulled out my handy Yelp Ap on my phone to see what was in the area.  Forefathers quickly grabbed my attention.  Meat & Cheese yes! So there we go, I had the beef with cheese wiz, my BF had the chicken with marinara.  Both were loaded with meat/chicken, they were not stingy at all with the meat.  The lady at the counter was so friendly and helpful too.  I was able to get 2 cookies as a side, and OMG those cookies were the best! Make sure you try them, they are homemade, fat, and soft with chocolate chips. And normally I don't consider myself much of a french fries enthusiast, but they were so good I ended up eating half of my boyfriends order. I also loved the American theme, and felt like the place was a family business, I could be wrong but thats the vibe I got.  Overall, a very pleasant surprise.

I'd give the sushi a 3, atmosphere and location a 4, and service a 4- however I went during the week, and it was not busy at all. Seems like a very cool place for sake bombs and embarrassing karaoke nights.  Overall, not bad at all!

Oh, Patties, I just have one question for you- Where have you been all my life? One of my favorite dives in Old Town.  Great place for day drinking, or  weekend shenanigans.  It's big, it's fun, and the beer is cheap! I faintly remember some live music and dancing as well. All good things if you ask me. So if your in the mood for a good dive- check this place out! And if you see me here- buy me a drink!

This is not only my very favorite bar, but one of my favorite places period. Great live country music, a campfire, beautiful Arizona sky above with lots of stars shining. Plus you have  your choice of sitting in the lounge or restaurant area. I recommend those little fried beef bites- I like mine with ketchup.  This place is out in the middle of no-where, and every time I'm in town, stopping by is a MUST. This place would be heaven on earth for me, but stops just shy of perfection because i have to knock off a few points for the lack of eye candy.

Pretty good grub. The atmosphere is quite festive, the prices are fairly low, I've never had to wait for a table, and the service has always been friendly and attentive. Yes, I am mexican so I know authentic mexican food, and I've even taken my parents here, and my own father who is the king of Chile had a hard time handling the heat from their Hatch chiles. Man those things have some kick to them! if you like spicy, give them a try!

So far, my favorite place I've hiked. Probably because it's been the easiest hike I've been on. It's very scenic, great views right from the start. Love the area, not too short, yet not to long. Gorgeous wild cacti that are amongst the tallest I've ever seen.  No dogs on this trail- Crowded on weekends

When I think of authentic mariscos (mexican seafood), I think about this place. Its not fancy, but its definitely the place to go for ceviche, whole fried fish, shrimp cocktails, 7 mares, and shrimp prepared about a dozen different ways, as well as margaritas & micheladas.  I took my parents here while they were in town & they wanted to come back the very next evening.

FINALLY got to try this place, after I heard so many great things about it, and seeing it on the Food Network. First time I came was on a Monday a couple months back & they were closed. (SHAKING FIST AT YOU IN ANGER) But now they are open on Mondays. Yesterday I went in wanting to try the honey blue cheese but they were out, determined to try something odd, I asked for the bacon ice cream- but they only have it on weekend. :( So I ended up trying a few less-odd options, and you can definitely taste the pure simple yet delicious ingredients & quality in this ice cream. Very natural, full of flavor. I recommend the Strawberry.  I did have a taste of the bacon brittle which had a very strong bacon flavor, personally, I would not recommend it. But the ice cream and regular brittle was very good. Can't wait to go back & try the horchata flavor.

Outdoor malls are poppin up all over the place, heres my pros & cons on this mall -looks a little different than other malls, very modern- kind of dark and gray, but in a cool wayl -very family friendly, totally got a good, positive, wholesome vibe here.  -you know what to expect (all the usual suspects, American Eagle, Banana Republic, Bath & Body works, Foot Locker, Forever 21, Sephora, ect) -A good amount of restaurants to choose from -Last time I went they had live music   Cons-  Too hot in summer to be walking around

This is my favorite Chinese buffet I've been to so far. The variety of food, and the value are as big as my stomach is when I walk out of here.  Tip- try the chocolate cake- so moist Tip- try the Chinese cheesecake (or egg tart if available) Tip- cream cheese wontons! Can't get enough

Unexpectedly stumbled upon the Riparian Preserve while driving around Gilbert, and just so happens I had my lil fleabag Miley with me, so thought we'd stop by & check it out.  As we followed the paths, we passed a bee garden, a hummingbird garden, as well as a butterfly garden. We enjoyed the shaded bench areas where you can rest & admire the stream, the views of the water. Very relaxing and perfect for a walk, or jog, or family time.  Was not super crowded, plenty of room to walk around and explore.  I even found a couple turtles laying around. Going to come back to check the observatory, and to do a little fishing.  Tip -please pickup after your pets

You know how some people say that those little mom & pops "hole-in-the-wall" restaurants make the best food? Well, this is THAT place. Seriously, words can't express how much I love pupusas, and choices are limited here in Phoenix, but this place does it right. For those of you who have never had one, it's like a thick homeade tortilla stuffed with cheese and pork- or whatever you choose as the filling, then topped with this pickled cabbage/onion/carrot mixture. Amazing. Pupusas are only around 2 bucks each, and you only need 2 or 3 to fill you up.  Come check this place out- I know I'll be back soon.

Came here with my fellow Yelper Miss Lisa E, and very much enjoyed this upscale, fun, trendy restaurant.  Located within the W Hotel, makes a great spot for happy hour with friends, or a date night. The way the food is prepared, makes typically "scary" sushi a lot less intimidating for sushi rookies like me who don't typically eat things like octopus, eel, etc.  Everything I tried was quite delicious. I would suggest the fillet wrapped asparagus, and pretty much any of the rolls. The service was impeccable, its almost as if they knew we Yelpers, but seems like they are just that good! Looking forward to coming back.

This is one SEXY resort. Nestled at the foot of Camelback Mountain, this hotel has class and a very romantic ambience. What I love about this resort, is that it stays true to it's beautiful desert surroundings, instead of trying too hard to be something its not. It's not over-modern, or over-retro, like other nearby hotels. Montelucia boasts a great pool area with lots of events throughout the year(especially summertime) It's not the most affordable option, but a nice quality resort in a relaxing area while still being close to nightlife, shopping and hiking trails. Great place to stay for out-of-towners and locals alike.

Had a very nice experience here. Try the blood orange Margarita, its outstanding.  Cool location, friendly attentive service, tasty food and fair prices. I tried the Guacamole (YUM), the fajitas & the Tres leches cake (DOUBLE YUM) It is definitely not your typical mexican food, but that is what I liked about this place. Check it out if your in the neighborhood. And did I mention to try the blood orange Marg? Mmmmmmm!

Out of all the 984539845720398457 bars in old town Scottsdale, The Lodge has always been one of my top 2 choices. It's the best place to start the night, and I say this because after midnight there always seems to be a faint smell of vomit in the air, or aggressive & sloppy drunk girls in the bathroom.  Anyhow, this place is pretty solid all the way around.  Good stiff drinks, cool friendly staff,  and real hearty grub. From the humongous Sasquatch burger  (a hamburger that replaces the buns with grilled cheese sandwiches, which is big enough to feed Bigfoot) to some really tasty soups (I suggest the tortilla soup).   During the week The Lodge has yummy dinner specials for about 9-11 bucks, as well as pretty good lunch specials, and happy hour from 3-7pm.  And if you want to watch a game with some tasty wings and beer, this is your spot!   I mean, where else can you go to a bar in Old Town that makes you feel like your in a warm cozy cabin, have some drinks, play pool inside, corn hole outside, and molest giant Sasquatch statues while your at it?

Great hotel- though it's more of a condo. Got a room for my mom this past weekend and she liked it so much she didn't want to leave the resort. Our room was very large. Had s dining room, living room, fully stocked kitchen, 2 patios, and a large bedroom and bathroom. There's like 3 or 4 pools in the resort, a nice restaurant and bar with live music. It's  Close to Desert Ridge, and the Quarter so good location for out of own visitors. Got an amazing price through hotwire. Service was also outstanding. Nice job Xona!

Best club ive been to in years. Beautiful place, large outdoor area, and it's like a hottybomb exploded in this place, There were gorgeous women all over the place. Just like any hot Vegas club, this place can get quite crowded and too often you find yourself surrounded by people invading your personal space. They also play good music so if you find a spot, dance and drink the night away!

I agree with all the other reviews. love how it's not crowded at all, love the views, love the location, it's a good workout.  Getting to the top is harder than it looks. First time I went, I totally failed! My out-of-shape butt threw in the towel before getting to the top.  Some parts were hard to follow as I wasn't sure if I was still on the trail, but there are a few different trails to choose from. Parking has never been a problem, and this place is really fun.

The Green Belt makes me wish so bad that I knew how to ride a bike. I used to fall of my tricycle as a kid, but thats another story. This place has an awesome relaxed, peaceful vibe. Great for a jog, for walking your pup, or for a picnic date. It goes on for miles, and makes for great sunrise/sunset views.  I've seen a couple creepers here & there, but nothing that would keep me from coming back.

Cool place to grab a drink if your staying at the Luxorl or waiting to get into LAX nightclub. Open & airy, dark romantic vibe going on, and they have video poker at the bar. Tip- you get free drinks if you'r playing at the bar! hallah!  Tip- try the Vodka tonic w/ lime

This hotel kicks ass. It's so new, modern, luxurious and affordable. Terrific service at check in, we all won money gambling, great restaurants, lounges/club all in the hotel. Also right next to the Belagio and New Cosmo hotel. It took me and my 2 girlfriends like 15 minutes to figure out how to work the lights/automated curtains/video and audio, but hey... Girls and technology just DON'T mix! I loved this hotel, I am SO coming back here again next time I'm in town.

Would have given 4-5 stars if not for the unacceptable, rude, and appalling service here.  I've never wanted to punch a bartender in the face more than I did here. I have had bad experiences in the bar a couple times before, but this last Saturday takes the cake!  first I get a completely different drink than I ask for, when I kindly ask for the correct drink, Miss witch-bartender gets upset with me, cuffs the biggest attitude and even yells at me telling me she gave me what I asked for, stomps off, tosses my correct drinks on the counter, and on top of that, overcharges me!!  By far the poorest excuse for a bartender I've ever encountered. It's a shame too, because the place is gorgeous, one of the nicest spots in Old Town, and pretty good eye candy.  I have come here 7-8 times and always bring out town visitors here, but nothing will compensate the way you are treated here. Unacceptable!

Toby Keith Bar & Grill, where shall I start?   It's my kind of place, just walking through the front door puts a bit smile on my face. It ain't too far, come as you are, I love this bar.  If you know these lyrics, then you will most likely enjoy this bar just as I do.  There is good country music playing, large beers served in a mason jar, and did I mentioned the deep fried Twinkies? There is plenty of room, an nice little outdoor patio, decent country crowd, and lots of 2-steppers getting down on the dance-floor.  The drawbacks? I would have given a solid five stars if not for the way the rude bouncers started kicking us out when it got close to 2am. I am not used to being treated that way, and I could not believe that is how management has their bouncers treat their customers. That did really leave a bad taste in my mouth, but I still have love for Toby Keiths. I will come back every chance I get!  Tip- Toby's has pretty good concerts. Check out the website to find any upcoming performances!

My fave location, which is strange because it's a smaller "active" gym. But I love it because: 1.  It's clean. And so are the people that come here. No one stinks or makes weird noises when they are working out next to you.  2.  Good location  3. Very friendly and knowledgable staff that seems to actually be happy to be there. 4. The number of groupX classes are more limited that other "sport" gyms, but they are great quality classes. like they say... quality over quantity!  Tip; try the bootcamp class. I was sore for days!

This place was recommended by people at work so checked it out yesterday, and I was not disappointed. I started off with the richest, most moist Red Velvet cake I've ever had. Was so rich, that I only was able to eat 1/3rd of the slice. I went with the "Betty-Boop" plate which consisted of 1 breast and 1 waffle. Perfect portion.  I'm no master chef, but I believe I tasted a bit of cinnamon or some kind of spice in the waffle- it was very delicious. The fried chicken was my favorite part if the meal. I took advantage of the Chile vinegar as well as the Louisiana hot sauce.  I also love they serve Kool-aid here. The prices are decent- not too cheap, not too expensive.  Overall, I would love to come back and would recommend this place to anyone who likes some good fried chicken.

Been on the hunt recently for good pizza joints close to home. Drove by this place, but looked more like a sit down place, so I called to see if the sell pizza by the slice. They do! I had to wait like 6 minutes, but no biggy. It was so good too, especially because it was really fresh. It's a chill place, but I totally recommend this place for pizza.

Really good breakfast joint. Was going to go to the Phoenix location, then found out there was a closer location over by Bell & the 101 in North Scottsdale. As, I am an avid fan of the Food Network and Guy Fieri, I had to try this place as its been on both DD&D, and BTIEA. I tried the featured Waffle Dogs as an appetizer and found them to be really good. The sausage is very good quality, large and juicy. The batter was light and airy. They are served with syrup, though personally I would like to try them with ketchup instead. I then decided to satisfy my sweet craving with the half order of caramelized banana and pecan french toast. I enjoyed the dish very much, neither the bananas or the syrup was overpowering, it was a very nice balance, and the bread was soft and warm and just delicious. Next time I go I am going to try the chicken fried steak & eggs! Oh ya.

Love this spot. Parking never seems to be a problem in this part of Old Town. Walking in, we were greeted warmly by the hostess.  My girlfriend and I chose to sit in the lovely outdoor patio to enjoy the perfect weather that night. Our server was very helpful and recommended some pretty fabulous red wine. My girlfriend who brought me here used to work there so she recommended the bruschetta as an appetizer followed by the  amazing 5th and Wine burger and ending with the cheesecake. Umm... Yes total foodgasm! I need a cigarette. But seriously, I loved my burger, the fries, the salad - everything we had was delicious. Best believe I'll be back very soon!  Tip- $5 glasses of wine during HH

This place is hot dog heaven. Chili dogs, Philly dogs, Hebew dogs, Chicago dogs, even burrito dogs! Ive been eyeballing this place everyday when I pass by for work. I finally made my way in last week. The prices are fair, and they even had my favorite soda- tamarindo jarritos (don't judge) if you ever find yourself craving a hot dog, you want to come check this place out.  Tip- be naughty and order a dog wrapped in bacon

Been here a handful of times now, and it's always an all around great experience. I love the decor, the fabulous chandeliers, the oversized chairs that make me feel like Alice in Wonderland in the tea party scene. But what I love the most is the food. Oh the glorious, tasty, want it in mah' belly-right-now food! Doesn't matter what you order, it's gonna be good. So far, my favorite place for dinner in the area. Tip- try the caramel custard desert Tip- pretzel bun turkey pastrami Tip- fried chicken n biscuits Tip- Acai mojito  That is all

Stellar club/lounge. This place has everything I look for in a club. Great service, good management, great drinks, great crowd, sexy ambiance, dance floor that's not overly crowded & clean bathrooms. ;) the music was a lil old school but I didn't mind it- though it wouldn't hurt if the threw in some more music from this decade.  Well done Mabels, well done!

Really really really ridiculously delicious. I tried the fried chicken eggs benedict- it was UNREAL & so was the portion. The line sucks, and this restaurant is inside the Imperial Palace, but who cares- the grub is worth it. Stay away if your trying to eat healthy or watching your weight. I walked  out probably 5lbs heavier than when I walked in. This place totally lives up to the hype- got to try it next time your in Vegas.

Cool place. It's never been ridiculously crowded anytime I've gone. Plenty of room to shake your rump on the dance floor without bumping into anyone. And personally, I find that the bartenders here are much friendlier and attentive as opposed to any other Old Town club I have been to. Bathrooms and music here also were pretty sweet.  Tip- ladies be on the lookout for their promoters, they give out free drink tickets. Sold!

Yes, I'm a fan. It's great that they take walk ins, I didn't have to wait at all, I was in & out in 20 minutes.   I was credited half the price since I was a new client, plus I got another $5 credit for my next appointment. Score!  It can be quite embarrassing dropping trou for a complete stranger, but Alexa, my esthetician was professional, and made me feel comfortable. I also really dug the waxing technique they use- it's a blue warm wax that hardened quickly, and is pulled off. I did find this to be less painful, and less messy than the standard strip method. Skin was left very soft, with no irritation or ingrowns or spots left behind. So what are you waiting for? Bikini season has officially arrived- time to wax it off and have some fun in the sun!  Tip- refer friends for another discount!

Seriously? Ruuudddde! Gawd, who stands outside of their store (which was empty by the way) to tell people who park by the store that they need to move their car?? There's no assigned parking spots  but apparently this guy thinks he's the parking police.  Cigars make great gifts for men, but I'm going to Cigar-king when it's time to do my Christmas shopping-sheesh.

Perfect example of sexy meets trashy laid out in a country/rock dive in the heart of Old Town. Indeed very reminiscent of Coyote-Ugly. Lots of hot skinny chicks showing lots of skin shaking it on a bar and poles, no wonder this place is jam-packed with men of all ages. I like the place and all, but hey, owners- if your reading this- how about some eye candy for the ladies? Because that picture of Naked Burt Reynolds in the restroom just isn't cutting it!

I prefer the sushi here above most other sushi places in town like Ra, or Kona. Tastes fresh, creative rolls, tasty drinks, great environment for happy hour with coworkers, or a fun date. Good deals for happy hour, though the rolls I like the best never seem to be in special- boo! Tip- duh- sake bombs! Tip- the lollipop shaped sushi

Love this spot- especially for weekend breakfasts. Not to sound like a pervert or anything, but the staff is quite good looking, and very nice as well. I've been here several times, and always received excellent service.   Good people-watching spot, but the food is also very good.  Everything I've tried here has been scrumptious and fairly priced. Try the protein pancakes. Also, as others have stated, come here to take advantage of the bottomless mimosas.

This is the place to go when you need to pick up a last minute gift for your mom, your sister, friend, cousin, niece, ect. You get the picture. Its mainly pretty girly sparkly accessories, but they also have some clothes, shoes, lots a purses, hats, sunglasses and wallets. Seems like every time I come here to pick up a gift for someone, I end up getting more things for myself. You ladies know what I'm talking about.   Anyhow, the prices are good, and they have pretty amazing specials/sales on clearance items. The girls that work here are very nice and helpful too. Great place to go for Christmas shopping.

If pigging out at casino buffets is wrong, I don't wanna be right. My favorite casino in the area, there is a really good buffet called Wandering Horse, a swanky lil piano bar, and of course, the pool club. Fun for all ages, and great for out of town visitors.  I literally had to pry my parents away from the penny slots- they just love it here.  Just a couple of downfalls.  I have recently attempted to come for the breakfast buffet, but to my dismay, it ends at 1030am, and I came right around 10:37, so I was out of luck... TWICE! Grrrrrr.... Also,  the crowd can be a bit iffy sometimes. Other than that, It's all good!

I really like this place. Good happy hour, pretty good crowd- I didn't see a bunch of D-bags like others mentioned. I did get a rude bartender once but no biggy. They have live music, and it's a good size place so you don't feel claustrophobic or have people invading your personal space. Cool decor too, I found it kinda romantic.  Tip- try the mojito with coconut rum.

I have been to Lucky Strikes a couple times, it is located on the second floor of Cityscape in downtown Phoenix area.  Unfortunately, last time I came with a serious beast-like hunger and I had every intention  of shamelessly stuffing my face with lots of delicious bar food as soon as I sat down. I  ordered the nachos and the mini bacon cheese burgers. Lets just say both dishes were mundane and anticlimactic at best. The nachos left me extremely unsatisfied and wanting to run to Filberto's on my way home!  On a more positive note, the place looks very cool, modern trendy and pretty large.  It does seem good for parties and bigger groups. If bowling is your thing, I'd say this place is worth checking out but don't come for the food. just saying.

Drive thru donut shop? Genius! Love the concept, but knocking off 1 star because the variety is a bit limited. I've gone 3 times already and they never have my favorite donut- whats a girl gotta do to get a pink frosting cake donut?

Really liked this place. Great big outdoor patio, decent crowd. Its not too casual, but not too dressy. Took a bit long to get my drinks, but hey- it was a Saturday night. I'd say overall, one of my top 5 places in old town.  Tip- check in & get specials Oh, and they are also open late, Friday night they still let me order food at 3am! How cool is that?

I came for lunch last week and they have really good specials, not too crowded and good service.  Great place for taco Tuesday or happy hour pretty much any day. Casual chill yet fun vibe early but come a little later for more of a party vibe. Its worth checkin out if your in the area and remember... Tequila makes her clothes fall off.

Oh ya, me likey. Large store with lots of shoes. Good deals like buy 1, get 1 half off. Large selection, and its not that busy, so you can shop in peace without having to fight off crazy shoe loving women from getting the last pair of your favorite shoes.

Looking for good authentic pair of boots? This is the place to check out.  Large selection (larger than the Scottsdale & Shea location) of boots, belts, clothing, and hats!  The employee helping me went out of his way, and even got on his his knees and showed me how a boot is supposed to fit. I get compliments on my boots every time I wear them. Thanks Saba's, I will be back.

Been here a couple times. It came highly recommended. The guy up front is very friendly. My check engine light had been on for a week. I came in, he helped me right away- didn't try to take advantage, or oversell me like other mechanics do when they see a single girl. The first time, I actually had to leave my car here because it was totally dead- (needed new spark plugs) he worked with me and gave me a discount which I appreciated as times are tough! I feel safe leaving my car here, I feel like this is a good honest local shop.

A truly great movie experience. I went yesterday for the first time, and it exceeded my expectations. It looks more like a nice modern lounge as opposed to a movie theatre. Shoot, the bathroom was nicer than half the clubs I've been to. There is a nice bar called Salt connected to the theatre- try the mojito with Malibu! So here's a few of the perks Ipic has to offer: -Buy tickets online, and choose where you want to sit. -Become a member free, and get discounts on tickets and food/drinks. -If you upgrade your seats you get reclining chairs - pillows and blankets available upon request. Though regular seating was very comfy as well. -there's a wine vending machine! -lots of food options. -they even sell buckets of beer. Located right smack in the middle of the Q in N. Scottsdale- if your a movie buff definitely check this place out!

I applaude The Green Room for being environmental friendly, and I hope this trend catches on with other salons.  The service here is very nice and unpretentious andI just love the look of this place, it's very modern, trendy and fun. Eric is the quite the hair guru and will not disappoint!

Tanzy is in a real cool spot at the Q, right next to ipic, Salt, and Narcise. The look of this place is gorgeous, very modern and elegant, and feels like a lounge as well as a nice restaurant/bar.  The drinks are very delicious, and original. I'm not a huge fan of the food- overpriced salads and unsatisfying appetizers. They do have a Sunday  brunch that is worth checking out. Seems like they always have open seating, and they also have nice views.

Finally made it to Narcisse on Friday night and found the place quite fabulous. With it's glam decor, comfy seating, and pretty views I was a happy camper. I got served my drinks very fast each time I ordered,  the music was pretty loud but still enjoyable, and the crown was attractive, friendly in the late-20's to early 40's age range, which is just right for me.  It's nice enough to wear heels and a little dress, or even jeans and a cute sweater. It was not overly crowded, nor did we have to wait in line to enter so nice job Narcisse! I shall be back for Sunday Brunch to take advantage of your $10.00 endless bubbly's!!

I'm still pretty new to the area, but so far this is one of my favorite places ive been to.  But then again, theres few things I enjoy more than laying out, having some pool fun and drinks with friends. Personally, I found this place very chill- especially in comparison to the crazy Vegas pool clubs. I kept hearing that is Douchebag central, but no one bothered me, I drank my Bud Light Limes in peace. I went Sat. No hassle or line getting in, bar was open and never had to wait long for a drink- so I was one happy lil camper. Love the concept- nice job Spanish Fly! I'll be back again soon.

Not a very well run establishment. Came here twice and won't be back.  The service was less than mediocre. I had left something behind on my last visit, went back for it, was told they didn't have it but I left my number just incase it came up. I got a call in the middle of the night from someone's cell later that night telling me they found it. Then I got a few butt-dials from the same person around 3 am! Not very professional.  And when I went back days later to pick it up, was told they didn't have it. No apology, no explanation- nothing. I asked for manager & told her what happened and even gave her number of the employee that had called me. Manager never even got back to me. What a joke.

While the food here was good, I am just not a fan of the long line, the packed atmosphere, and the tight quarters. Just don't feel like I had any personal space, and made me feel a bit stressed out, and rushed. I would suggest coming here for breakfast, however I highly recommend to avoid the busy hours.

The pros: cool place, nice decor, not too loud, comfy seating, great outdoor patio areas, Yummy drinks, nice crowd but not overcrowded. The cons: tip was added to bill, and when I paid, waitress never brought me back my change. Very tacky.

I finally made it out to Cholla Steakhouse on my last night I was in town. Spring Training had just started, most restaurants were booked but luckily Cholla had availability so I booked and had a fantastic experience. The casino itself may be a bit of an eye sore, however the restaurant is charming and really nice.  It had an upscale feel without being stuffy. The prices were great, my rib eye was only $20! This is a steal compared to most steakhouses in Scottsdale.   The restaurant is small and quaint, nice white linen on the tables, and very attentive service.  I really appreciated all of the small details, like the yummy sorbet which was the 1st course, and oh my goodness, the chocolate truffles we received after we ate- all kinds of yummy!  My only suggestion/constructive criticism is that the tables are too close to each other. We could hear the whole conversation of the people in the table next to us. Other than that, everything was really great.  I will absolutely be returning.

Need to lose a quick 15-20 lbs? This is the place to do it. I've been looking for a place like this since I moved to AZ almost a year ago. They don't tie you in to some BS 1 year contract, they don't waste your time with in-house workouts and meetings to go over food journals, there is always a nurse or nutritionist here to answer questions if you have any.   It's simple and effective, and very affordable. So if your like me, and already know what you need to do (eat healthy and exercise) then this place will get you to your goal.  I go with the basic energy plan, it's 25 a week. Just remember, there is no magic pill that will make you skinny while living an unhealthy lifestyle. But if your committed to getting in shape, the medication you get here is a HUGE help.

Boyd's Blinds and Drapes is definitely the place to go for shades, shutters, or blinds. They do fantastic work, and provide a high level of customer service that you just don't find anymore.  Boyd actually answers all your questions, provides color samples, and makes sure the product will match. The prices are good, and the quality is even better. Oh, and did I mention the lifetime guarantee? If you want your shutters done right, done fast, and not have to worry about being over-charged, check out Boyd's!

OK, can I just say that this place actually exceeded all the hype I had heard? You may have driven by this gas station/ car wash/ market/ restaurant if you were in the WestWorld area, and not even know you were missing out on the best tacos ever.  Trust me, I'm Mexican, and my family ran a restaurant growing up so I KNOW GOOD TACOS. While BBQ tacos are not typical at your average taco stand, they are truly delicious. I mean juicy, and the perfect combination of sweet, salty, and spicy.    I had heard it was really nice inside, and I was still pretty taken back when I walked in.  The dining area had a chandelier and linen tablecloths!  Who knew a gas station eatery could be romantic and classy? Such a pleasant surprise to come across this place, y'all seriously gotta check it out.

So first off, giving Sol a star for the food- they have good solid tacos.  Tried the carnitas, grilled fish, and breaded fish tacos, as well as the guacamole.  I would recommend all 4 items, and word on the street is that the ceviche does not suck at all.    Giving 1 more star for the service... and the studly eyecandy (I'm talking about our 2 hot bartenders)    Another star for the cool vibe and look of the place, awesome location in the Scottsdale Quarter.  Good for an after work happy hour, a hot date, or even lunch if you work in the area. Didn't have to wait for a table and there was even open seats at the bar.  One more star for the delicious margaritas and the five dollar off deal for checking in on Yelp!  Knocking off 1 star because happy hour ends at six p.m.  Boo, really?  And, lastly giving one more star because they do have a good taco Tuesday which goes on all evening, and consist of good deals on tacos and margaritas.    Long live taco Tuesday's!!  Tip- come by and check out the Sunday Brunch

It's a pool bar! You can't go wrong when you mix a pool, margaritas, friends and food in Scottsdale- you just can't!  Loved the look of this place, it's very large and they do have a restaurant side as well as the awesome cantina side. The cantina side has a resort-like pool area, large bar, cabanas, several tables and outdoor seating. Granted, our unpleasant waitress seemed to hate the world, but other than that, very cool spot.  Decent tacos, pretty good Cadillac Margaritas, and really good Micheladas (bloody-beer as the gringos refer to them). I very much look forward to spending many hot Arizona summer days and nights here! El Santo, you got yourself a new regular.  Tip- OMG try the ceviche! You cant beat this deal, good quality & it's only 5 bucks. HH is M-F till 7pm.  Tip- shoutout to our awesome bartender Maddy! (sorry if I spelled that wrong)

Ok, so let me start by saying, I used to SWEAR by discount cab. Used them so often I had them on my speed dial! That is NO LONGER the case.  In fact, I used to absolutely refuse to take anything other than a Discount Cab.  That was before tonight  though.  So, tonight...i waited BY MYSELF as a single female... IN MESA... FOR AN HOUR... to get picked up from a ride that never came.  I called for a cab, and I gave them my name however apparently, if someone else gets to the cab before you.. your just sh#% out of luck.  I called again and they said they would send another cab out.  ( I received this response at least 4 times).  20 minutes later- no cab in sight. Called again... and again...and again.  Manager was no help.  The Manager's supervisor was no help.  I got attitude stating I was calling during "their busy times".  Eventually the guy that I got on the phone actually complained that I had been "calling every 10 minutes". The nerve! I can hardly recall ever experiencing such horrible customer service from anywhere before. I was appalled and offended and highly disappointed. Shame on you Discount Cab!   I waited OVER AN HOUR.  Called 6 times.  No help from supervisors, managers, or anyone.   Needless to say, I will never use this cab service again. EVERRRRR!!!  That is all.  Suck it Discount Cab.

I am so glad I found Shayne- she was just awesome. She worked with my schedule when several other CPA's I contacted only made appointments during business hours, so if you are like me and work business hours, it creates a problem! Shayne took her time with me and was very pleasant to work with and helpful. She may be young and cute, but don't let that fool you, she knows her stuff! I went in to her office feeling stressed, nervous, scared, and uncertain.  I left feeling confident, relieved and in good hands. 1 more 5 star review for my new CPA.

I know what many of you must be thinking -how can a Filly B's have 4.5 stars? Well I'll tell you how, It's not your average Filibertos. There is a hostess when you first walk in.  The bar is on the left.  Yes folks I said a bar! There's a big screen, music, pool table and full service bar! Boom. You sit down at a table, there is a waitress and you are given actual menus.  The staff is so cool, friendly, and humble. Everyone I bring here is surprised its a Filibertos, yet the same good food and low prices as all the other chains.  Foods I would suggest would be the carne asada tacos, nachos, steak ranchero, chorizo con huevos, ceviche, bean & cheese burritos & most importantly the deep fried ice cream.  Can I get an amen? Come down and bring some friends.  Tip- the drive thru is now open but I highly suggest foregoing the drive thru & stepping on in!

Best donuts in town!  Good selection, and especially love the cake donuts.  I highly recommend the buttermilk bar, and vanilla cake donut, just some of my personal favorites. They also serve breakfast bagel sandwiches and fantastic sausage, egg & cheese croissants. Oh, and did I mention the smoothies? OMG gotta try the coconut flavor.    There is a convenient drive-thru window as well, however if you want to order a dozen, and choose each donut, you may want to go inside instead of using the drive-thru. I WOULD have given a solid 5 stars if not for the drive thru-window post asking for tips! Sorry, but thats just tacky.

Man, this place is run like a well oiled machine for sure, almost military style! I had been dreading coming here as I am not a fan of crowds or lines. There are always crowds and long lines here, but don't let that discourage you, they really do go fast. From the items I've had I would recommend the Italian beef sandwich, the cheese fries and the chocolate cake shake. Not so much the chili cheese fries, or the croissant beef sandwich- they were OK, but I think the portions are on the smaller side, and the meat lacks some flavor. But don't get me wrong, its good grub and all. Its just all the crazy hype holds it up too high, and its hard to meet those expectations.   Tip - they ship their food all over the US- how cool is that?

I do love a restaurant that has happy hour every day (including weekends). Especially when duck fat fries, honey rosemary fried chicken and pork belly tacos, and deviled eggs on are the HH menu. The live music, tasty cocktails, and good service makes this a top choice for date night, girls night, or after-work cocktails.

If you are looking for a good place to do some country dancing during the week, I suggest coming to Moonshine on a Wednesday night.  It's not too crowded and they have a good size dance floor, so you can dance the night away without worrying about getting kicked in the face by a fellow two-stepper.   The bartender that helped us (don't recall his name, but early 30's dude) was super cool, not-douchey  or bro'ey, and gave great service. The location is a tad hard to find, as it's kind of tucked away but it's right off of Mill, and there was a good amount of open parking nearby just steps away. I have not been here on a weekend, as I try to avoid the younger (early to mid 20's) crowd, but I heard it can get pretty packed. Overall, I had a very good time here and would love to return.

I was lured in one early Saturday morning by a guy waving a sign advertising a bacon & egg breakfast special on the corner of Scottsdale & Shea.  Whats a hungry girl to do? I see the word bacon, and I come running.  I was pretty surprised that they were open so early in the morning, so I went on in to check it out. What I found was a super cool bar with crazy decorations and colors and pretty damn good food too, at very reasonable prices. I was told their chicken fried steak is a must try, so I'll have to get that next time. The bartender and cook were very friendly. Also came back one night for drinks with a girlfriend and once again had a very cool bartender, and we opted for some asian dishes which weren't bad at all. Really cool place for drinks with friends, will come back for sure.   Tip- this place opens up like at 7am on weekends!

I actually visited Maya this past weekend and was pleasantly surprised there was no cover, my girlfriend and I walked right in (score). I was then surprised at how nice it was, and the size of the place which was very large, no lack of personal space at all (double score). The drinks were good though if you ask me, they were too small, and seem to somehow finish way too fast. Had a blast and look forward to spending many hot sunny summer days here.   Note to self- make sure to starve for 2 weeks prior to my next visit.

Checked out this place for restaurant week, and found it to be a lovely restaurant.  Not very large, but pretty classy, with several specialty drinks to choose from.  I highly recommend the Thai margarita. The service was also top notch.  The original chopped salad did not disappoint, though it was pretty much the same as the stetson salad at Cowboy Ciao.  Also tried the chimichuri chicken, which was not bad however next time I will definitely go with the grilled filet mignon with asparagus dish, it looked amazzzzing!

So I decided to stray from my usual gym & try something new. Planet Fitness was the closest gym to where I live so my boyfriend & I signed up.    Here's a few pro's: Very quick and easy sign up process.  Very low cost with no commitment.  Clean facility, they have wifi, and it's never too busy so there are always machines available. If you upgrade your membership you also have access to unlimited tanning and a few other cool machines I have yet to try. You can also bring a guest to work out with you.  Lastly, there's no annoying "personal training" or membership upgrading sales pitches from employees. You can come and be left alone to workout without being bothered.   Cons: No swimming pool/sauna/steam room.  No group classes like yoga, spin, Zumba, ect. If you get the basic plan, you can only go to that particular gym and no other locations.   That's about it, overall very worth the price! I have not found a better deal at any other gym.

Saw that this location recently opened, so went to check it out this weekend, and so glad we did.  The place looks and feels like a somewhat retro diner but its all new, modern and clean.  You order at the counter, and seat yourself, and you get your own drinks.  I liked this because you end up getting your food faster. The prices were normal, but they do have good lunch specials with soup, salad & half a sandwich for around 8 bucks or so.   Each item we had, from the hash browns, to the eggs, to the chicken fried steak & even the pancakes were all really good, hearty, and tasted fresh. Large generous portions, and our plates came with a big ol' chocolate covered strawberry. Bring your appetite and definitely try the cinnamon bun!

I've come here a handful of times, the $5.00 all you can pizza slices for lunch is a deal hard to beat, whatever toppings you want.  The slices are so big however, I've never been able to eat more than two.  There is large array of toppings to choose from, from the standard pepperoni, sausage, peppers, onions, mushrooms, to buffalo chicken & bbq pulled pork. All of which I thought were pretty damn good.  We have even ordered food from here for all whole office a couple times, with no complaints.

Vaqueros serves monster sized burritos. 1 burrito is big enough for 2 people.  And the burritos are always served super piping  hot. Let it cool down for 5-10 minutes or you'll burn all your taste buds off and won't be able to taste all of the deliciousness.  I recommend the ham & egg, the bacon, egg, potatoe n cheese, and the shredded beef burritos.  The food is good, cheap, and plentiful. The service however really sucks.  Tip- grab a large horchata.   You're welcome.

Received shockingly rude service here by some guy named Steve. Pizza was very late, and when I called in, was given attitude instead of an apology. I ended up canceling the order after waiting almost 2 hours.  People that rude should not be working in the service industry. Worst pizza hut ever.

So this was the old Mondrian Hotel. While you can tell the place is on the older side, it's very well kept and has that modern- retro mid century vibe going on. Good location, right in Old Town and the staff seemed friendly enough, while I didn't like that there is no public or visitor parking. You have no choice, you have to Valet- it costs 5 bucks. I suggest parking in one of the parking lots right outside of the complex if you don't want to valet your car. My friend paid about 100 bucks for the room, which I thought was very fair.  I also passed a lovely area by the pool with a hammock, I am tempted to sneak in and send a couple hours there with a good book and umbrella drink!
