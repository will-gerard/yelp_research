If you're visiting Cave Creek in the Phoenix area, you must visit this store. One of the members in our group always stops in when visiting so we wanted to see what it was all about.  The store is pretty tiny but there is a lot of inventory. Lots of specialty dipping and marinating sauces and great gift items.   The gal working was very friendly but borderline a pushy salesperson. If you picked something up to look at, she'd instantly sell you on it. I get turned off by that so after her doing it 5 or 6 times, I didn't bother picking up anything in fear I'd get 25 reasons why I can't leave without it.   In the end, we purchased a mango habanero sauce and also a few gag gifts which were great. My favorite was, "Wake The F#$@ Up Coffee".    If you can get past the pushy sales antics, you'll enjoy this store.

The Rio is not one of the hot spots in Vegas but for the purposes of this trip, it served its purpose and served it well.   This was the hotel that my husbands team stayed out during their most recent hockey tournament in Vegas. The rooms are all suites so the single guys were able to bunk up and the couples had enough room to spread out away from all the stinky hockey gear. Plus, they provided discounted rooms for just over $100 a day so perfect for those on a budget. The rooms and the facilities aren't all that bad either so if you can get past that, you'll be ok.  They do have a work out facility but you have to either pay for a treatment at the spa OR spend $25 to use the gym. You also have to pay for wi-fi. The spa is ok but don't expect anything super luxurious - just comfortable (http://www.yelp.com/biz/rio-spa-and-salon-las-vegas#hrid:LOKuIdrMxaY8xiUAvHcGug). There are two Starbucks (http://www.yelp.com/biz/starbucks-las-vegas-44#hrid:CvJgGgBFtQitf0q6XDbKZA)and many restaurants to chose from. I actually realized we didn't eat at any of them, although, I did order a cobb salad to the room one night and it was pretty decent.   If you stay here, don't expect anything fancy but you will at least be comfortable. Our main focus was the hubby's hockey tournament (http://www.yelp.com/biz/las-vegas-ice-center-las-vegas#hrid:6v6HbPaPwAOLW6aWR3gR-g) so I wasn't really planning to spend much time on the Vegas strip and was ok with this hotel being off the beaten path.   I give the Rio 4 stars for the price and for meeting our needs during this Vegas trip.

Ann Taylor is one of my favorite clothing shops for work attire. I have purchased many of their suits and lots of their sweaters and tops and they've really held up over the years. I don't wear suits very often these days but I've still managed to find tops and accessories here and this recent trip in Vegas was no exception.  I picked up a long sleeve canary yellow sweater (http://www.anntaylor.com/ann/product/product%3A292080/AT-MHL-Graphic-Black-%26-White/Spring-Cardigan/292080?colorExplode=false&skuId=13384692&catid=cat1270002&productPageType=search&defaultColor=3221) that I saw in the window and had to have it. Unfortunately, my husband didn't really care for it so it'll be going back. boo hoo. In addition, picked up a really light weight scarf (http://www.anntaylor.com/ann/product/AT-Accessories/AT-View-All/Pen-and-Ink-Paisley-Scarf/300682?colorExplode=false&skuId=13218638&catid=cata000025&productPageType=search&defaultColor=9192)  that I could wear in San Diego - even during the summer months.  I've actually already worn it and I love the way it feels against my skin and it's the perfect accessory for any outfit. I'm so glad I purchased as it will be getting lots of use this season.  I also picked up a lightweight blouse (http://www.anntaylor.com/ann/product/AT-Petites/AT-Petite-Blouses-Tops/Petite-Paisley-Brocade-Blouse/302152?colorExplode=false&skuId=13381806&catid=cata000026&productPageType=search&defaultColor=3221) in the same pattern as the scarf I purchased. It won't be worn together but on their own, they're great!  It's a super comfy blouse that can be dressed up or down.  I usually don't buy things in the same patterns but I couldn't pass either of them up.   Thanks Ann Taylor for the successful shopping trip!

My friends were able to get the 4 of us a 8:15pm reservation on our first night in Vegas - which happened to be a Thursday. I was super excited to try this restaurant as I've had the Yountville location bookmarked for some time now--and of course, Thomas Keller is one of my favorite celebrity chefs.  I'm still working my way through his cookbook but to this day, several items in there are my go-to recipes and are my most favorite.  We were lucky enough to get a booth on the back side of the restaurant. I was pleased with this seating arrangement because the tables in the center did not look as cozy and the bench seating provided us a lot more room to spread out and get comfy.  It's probably not so "french bistro" but in the end, It proved to be more private and much more intimate for our group.   For starters, the Epi (branch leafed bread) they immediately deliver to your table is irresistible and clearly made in house.  It was so fresh. We cleared both loaves before our appetizers were even out. The warmth of the bread, the crunch of the crust and perfect center -  along with the creamy, room temperature butter left me with no self control. It must've been obvious because the bus boy brought another loaf and even gave us an entire bag of bread on our way out along with a little wink. Cute.   While we all ordered our own dishes, we all kind of tasted each others plate so i'll give you the low down for each item ordered and what I tasted:  * Bone Marrow Appetizer (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bouchon-las-vegas?userid=rCx7tb3toOJUsvdOeqYY0g#IFq8fcrtUt9SsxQm6DbpQg): We ordered this for the table to share (minus my hubby since he doesn't do what he calls,"weird" food).  He missed out because this was so rich and full of flavor, I could've had this as my meal. We licked that plate clean. I could not get enough and craved more!  ORDER IT!    * Endive Salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bouchon-las-vegas?userid=rCx7tb3toOJUsvdOeqYY0g#sfV5ar3nyCDXMd2dYIRn6w): Since my hubby didn't indulge in the marrow, this was his appetizer. It was very tasty and the presentation was beautifully done with the endive leaves placed strategically on the plate as if a house of cards. The vinaigrette was not at all overpowering.  With the roquefort cheese and the nuts, it was nicely balanced.   * Smoked Salmon Appetizer (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bouchon-las-vegas?userid=rCx7tb3toOJUsvdOeqYY0g#kaFzihNKLmZyvcT5RR92Bg): Good things come in small packages. Presentation was simple - served in a small glass canning jar along with baguette slices.  I actually stole an endive from my hubby's salad and the salmon actually went really well with it. This appetizer was tasty but if I had to choose between this or the Bone Marrow, this wouldn't stand a chance.  * Trout (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bouchon-las-vegas?userid=rCx7tb3toOJUsvdOeqYY0g#2xOHkIxvWabr3zIB1ITElw): Seriously...this dish was off the hook! My friend also ordered this dish and we both agreed it was unbelievable.  We were both full but we kept going until every last morsel of fish was in our belly. The buttery croutons sprinkled on top were an unexpected addition but couldn't have been more perfect. I might have to steal that from him next time I prepare fish at home. Also, loved the presentation with the head on. It made my husband squirm but hello...he married a Filipino!  Get used to it!    * Roasted Chicken (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bouchon-las-vegas?userid=rCx7tb3toOJUsvdOeqYY0g#CijX0I2eVnH2eXejPOrk4A): Hubby ordered this one. I got a bite and the skin was nice and crispy, the meat was tender and had lots of flavor. He loved it and I enjoyed the bite I got.  * Short Ribs (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bouchon-las-vegas?userid=rCx7tb3toOJUsvdOeqYY0g#dmhLzxDCxt-KbyYgkG1FSg): My girlfriend ordered this and loved it. I was so stuffed, I couldn't take another bite of anything else. She was very pleased with her order.   * Dessert (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bouchon-las-vegas?userid=rCx7tb3toOJUsvdOeqYY0g#VZNaOGdvtZbpA2dw-8gmjw): Our awesome waiter wouldn't let us leave without dessert and insisted we get one that wasn't on the menu; Mini chocolate cakes with zest from a blood orange. This was served with a generous helping of vanilla ice cream on top, slices of flesh from a blood orange as well as several julienne candied orange zests. If you really like orange flavored desserts, you'll enjoy this.  The dining experience here was fantastic and I just think Chef Keller is a genius with how he approaches his menu. Everything we had far exceeded my expectations and made me one happy and full girl.  I look forward to coming back and trying their brunch next time...and of course, dinner (again).    Great job, Team Keller!

We stopped in for lunch and I have to say...seriously impressed!  We had to wait 15 minutes for a table but I'm glad the wait didn't deter us from eating here. We just took a short stroll along the water area and by the time we came back, our table was ready.   I LOVED the ambiance of this restaurant.  Very rustic decor, open kitchen, large dining and bar area and near the entrance; a section with bench seating with low coffee tables where patrons seemed to be enjoying cocktails and appetizers. I later discovered this was part of the bar. Very chic.  Even with high ceilings and openness of this restaurant, it was still very welcoming.  We were seated near the entrance to the outdoor patio so while we didn't sit outdoors, we felt like we were dining el fresco. This time of the year in Scottsdale is wonderful so we could not be any happier with where we were seated.   I ordered a Bloody Mary extra spicy and a margherita pizza (err flatbread) for lunch. The cocktail was made PERFECTLY and had a nice little kick to it...just how I like it.  The margherita pizza was absolutely delicious as well. The crust was thin, light and had great flavor and the toppings just made it that much more irresistible.  I didn't think I would be able to finish the entire pizza but I somehow did. I just could not stop myself, it was that tasty.  After complimenting our waitress (which I forgot her name (sorry!) on how great the service and food was, we discovered this is owned by the same company that manages True Food Kitchen, one of our favorite restaurants. We would come back here in a heartbeat....but since this is in Scottsdale and not in San Diego, it will be tough to get back here when we're craving you. So, can you please open an Olive & Ivy out here?

Our hosts for the weekend took us here for lunch and I'm so glad they did. GREAT food!  We were all starving so before our hostess could seat our party of 4, we had two orders of chips and guacamole and a round of top shelf margaritas ordered. The drinks were delivered right away and the chips and guacamole shortly followed. Chips and guacamole hit the spot and so did the margarita!  We all ended up ordering the same item; chicken enchiladas that came with spanish rice and black beans.  A pretty standard and typical item on a mexican restaurants menu but I have to say, it was very tasty and was prepared well.  The chicken was not dry at all. We all over indulged in chips and guac so finishing our entrees would be next to impossible. We had lots of leftovers, for sure.   We came on a Saturday afternoon right during the lunch rush hour but it wasn't busy at all. This allowed for our meals and drinks to come out rather quickly. We were in and out in an hour. Pretty quick lunch, I'll say...

Gosh, I can't believe I haven't written a review of this place. I've been here off on for my husbands annual hockey tournaments for the past 13 years. We used to come here with his teammates in San Jose many years ago so we have lots of history with this place. Good times and good memories for sure.  The hockey tournament they put on from a spectators stand point is done really well and seems very organized.  There aren't a ton of families in the stands because let's face it, men use this hockey weekend in Vegas as a boys weekend and the families are usually left at home. Fortunately for us hockey wives, it wasn't this case this year because with the exception of a few, we all came.   The rink itself is well maintained. The stands are pretty clean and comfy but wish they would put heaters up above to keep fans warm. Most rinks are doing this now. There is a snack bar in the center of the building joining the two rinks that serves the usual junk food but with the bar across the way, I think these snacks are tailored to the kids that come for the ice skating.   One of the games we had on Friday night we walked out from the ice rink and this placed was storming with lots of young, loud teenagers...so beware.

oh dear!  An outdoor fanatic could spend an entire day here and do some serious damage. This place is HUGE - over 165k square feet. I came here more for the experience and not to purchase anything in particular but had a few items in mind in case I came across them.   The camping selection is awesome and I loved all the different portable smokers and BBQ units that they had on display.  They have everything from basic camping needs to the more extreme prepping. They even had lots of food prep/processing items such a dehydrators, meat slicers and even sausage makers. Seeing them all displayed was actually pretty cool.  I was hoping to purchase hearing protector (preferably Browning) since I have been using the cheap styrofoam ones at the range but was disappointed when they didn't have any in stock. They had the high end 100+ dollar ones and some other models but none of them were appealing enough to take the leap.  They also had very little Browning branded items. I am looking for a pack to tie around my waist when i'm out there shooting trap and skeep and didn't find anything either. Perhaps they aren't a big dealer but was expecting a little more inventory than they had so was disappointed in that but if they're not a big browning dealing, I shouldn't be too hard on them.   These two sections were the two that I spent most time in but they have anything imaginable for the outdoors. It was definitely a fun trip to make outside of the usual vegas shenanigans.    Oh, I loved the huge fish tank they had in the middle of the store and all the mounted animals throughout the store. The Lions on display by the camping section was great as was the huge giraffe.  I want a pet giraffe... = )

My girlfriend and I stopped in here while we were waiting for our table at Gordon Ramsay BurGr (http://www.yelp.com/biz/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas#hrid:8hu0T6Fy6UXkQRU87KVAoQ). I have to admit, I don't do much shopping here because I don't wear too much make up and the make up I do purchase is usually bought online from Saks. I use the same old product each time so it's easy to purchase what I need and when I need it.   I've been running low on my tinted moisturizer and I was very pleased to find out that this store actually carries the Laura Mercier make up line that I use. I'm not sure if it's typical for them so this is how out of the loop I am. LoL  I've also been looking for a foundation with a little more coverage so sought out help by one of the associates. I'm pretty lame when it comes to make up so was a little worried when a gentleman came to my aid.  But, he ended up being great and helped me select a foundation that matched perfectly.   I picked up both products and put the foundation to use later that night.  The foundation was a little heavier than I'm used to but it provided great coverage and didn't make me look too made up. I'll probably use this for going out and not every day wear but something I'll definitely use.   The service was so great here that I might do more shopping at Sephora's in the future.

Don't do it!  My husband decided to get gelato here and was horribly disappointed with the service and the product. The guy working the counter on Saturday, 4/16 at around 4pm (they don't use name tags) could use a refresher on customer service. He did not crack a smile or even make eye contact - he also had no sense of urgency so the one person in front of us felt as if there were 20. When we approached the glass counter to place our order, everything he said was under his breathe and you can barely hear him over the noise from the shopping center.  He ordered two scoops of gelato and was told that he had to select the same flavor for both. WHAT?!  He wanted coffee and vanilla but was forced to choose one. That should've been a red flag for us to turn around but we stayed the course. It killed my husband to see him place once scoop of coffee on the cone...and for the guy to then place another on top. I don't understand why they can't have two flavors. Who picks the same flavor when they order two scoops?  To make matters worse, the coffee gelato was horrible. He should've gotten a sample of it before he ordered it but it tasted very artificial. I love coffee flavored things and I could not wait to take a sip of water to get rid of that horrible taste. I wouldn't recommend stopping here. It looks good from afar but this is not the real deal!

3.5 stars overall.  My girlfriend and I stopped in here for lunch while the hubbies were off playing hockey. Located right in the center of the Venetian shopping plaza, you have great views to do a little people watching and even watch the show they randomly put on throughout the day on the nearby stage.  I liked the outdoor seating area. Very cozy and very European. It was nice.   For lunch, we decided to share the Tuna salad and the Margherita pizza. For the salad, the menu read, "Tuna Roasted Tomato Artichoke Caprese Burrata Pesto Cherry Tomato Salad", a lot going on so I was a little intrigued at what the salad would look like.  It could also use some punctuation too.  The salad overall was a 3. A little too tangy for me to rave about it but nevertheless, it was tasty and enjoyable. I think they if they can simplify this salad, it would really go a long way.   The margherita pizza is what made this lunch for me. The crust was nice and thin, very tasty and had the right amount of cheese on it. I know it's pretty authentic to just place the whole basil leaves on the pizza but I never understood why restaurants do this because you can't get the taste of the basil in every bite. I prefer cooks and chefs to chiffonade the basil and then sprinkled on top. That way, the basil goes a long way.  The service here great. Our waiter was very attentive as well as the rest of the wait staff. We didn't have to ask or wait long for anything. My first visit to a Mario Batali restaurant and while he's in between a 3.5-4 stars for me, I'd definitely come back and try other things on the menu despite the mixed reviews here.

This Starbucks is located inside the Rio and actually there are two in the hotel. One by the elevators in the Ipanema Tower and one by the convention hall and spa. I visited both and found the one by the Ipanema towers were always packed but the one by the spa was always quiet and had no line. It's a little bit of a walk but I preferred this location better. Not only was it not busy but it also had a lot more seating and was away from all the chaos of the casinos and a bit less smokey too.   Service at both locations I found were great and employees were nice and friendly. Prepare for the higher prices though. Comparable to airport prices but I suppose that's the price you pay for convenience. And since you're ok with paying $15 for mixed drinks in Vegas, I suppose $5.50 for an iced coffee is about right. lol

The shopping district this restaurant is in seems to be the place to be on a weekend night. Driving through, I had an urge to walk around a bit but we utilized the valet parking for Dominick's which allowed us to unload right in front. This did not allow for any sort of window shopping.  Boo!  We were seated in the back of the restaurant which was a bit elevated and gave us a great view of the piano and bottom dining area. It was pretty cool set up. Lighting was pretty dim which seems to be typical of these fancy restaurants. If you've ever been to a swanky steakhouse, Dominick's menu is pretty much the same.  You have a choice of steak, chicken and even lobster. And all sides are ala carte...and pricey. Each range from $9-13   I went for the 8 ounce petite filet mignon medium rare and the table ordered practically all the sides; brussel sprouts with crispy bacon, mashed potatoes, sauteed spinach, creamed sweet corn, au gratin potatoes, au gratin cauliflower and the shoe string fries. In our defense, there were 4 couples and lots of left over sides. = )  I thoroughly enjoyed my steak and even had half of it left which I had the next day for lunch.  My husband ordered pasta with mixed veggies since he's not much of a meat eater and was really satisfied with his dinner. He indulged in plenty of our sides to not feel like he was missing out.  Our waiter was great and super attentive.  Drinks were refilled and refreshed regularly which made the table really happy. Dinners are a lot more entertaining when the alcohol is flowing.  The price of dining (or drinking for that matter) here is not cheap but if you're prepared to shell out some cash, it's a nice place to dress up and dine. For us, it was a nice little treat and date night. Overall, we had a very enjoyable time and if we're ever in the area, we will likely be back.

During my recent stay at the Rio, I decided to get a manicure and pedicure downstairs at the spa.  The spa itself is ok - not super luxurious but does the trick. You can use the steam room, sauna or hot tub if you purchase any of the services so my girlfriend who was getting a facial went down early to enjoy some of these amenities. The sauna was super hot and while I can usually stay 20 min. in one, I barely lasted 15. It felt good but seemed warmer than the sauna at my gym back home.  The relaxing area was dim and had ample seating but I wish they had stools to kick your feet up. I brought my Nook and was able to read a bit but couldn't really get super comfortable because the chairs were too upright.  Do they do this on purpose so we don't overstay our welcome?    The mani/pedi services I received from Crystal was great and she alone deserves 4 stars. She was very easy to talk to and made my visit fun and relaxing. The only reason why I couldn't give this spa higher marks is because the guy checking us in (Sammie) was not very friendly at all. He is the first person patrons comes into contact with when they come in and he was stone faced and not very warm and welcoming at ALL.  It was very off putting. If it weren't for him, they would've gotten another star. I'll get on my usual soap box rant with people who choose a profession that interacts with the public but aren't pleasant....If your job is to welcome guests into your establishment and you can't be friendly or even pleasant....CHOOSE ANOTHER LINE OF WORK!  I don't want to spend a $100+ to deal with a cranky ass receptionist.

After our hour long wait, I must've been cranky or something because I was really disappointed with the overall experience here. I was debating between 2 or 3 stars and after much debate, I finally landed on 2 stars...here's why.  The restaurant itself is pretty cool and I love the open kitchen concept. Having a little iPad to play with and peruse the menu is also very cool but the darn thing ended up being more of a pain than useful. It was difficult to get from section to section and the novelty quickly wore off.    Aside from our long wait, the visit actually started off great. We had a friendly, super sweet and upbeat waitress who was fantastic. We ordered the jalepeno poppers as an appetizer to the share amongst the 4 of us dining here.  They leave the seeds in one of the six poppers in to make it fun for those dining and sadly, I didn't get it - I love spicy. The poppers were nice and crispy on the outside and inside was stuffed with creamy cheese.  The dipping sauce it was served it was fantastic!  I wish I could get the recipe to that baby because it was one of the highlights of the meal.   For my entree, I ordered the farm burger which came with duck breast bacon, a fried egg, and sharp cheddar cheese. And for the table we ordered the famous truffle fries. As expected, I loved the truffle fries and the dipping sauces that came with were very tasty. The problem that I had was with the burger. I had asked for it to be medium but when I got it, my fried egg was way overcooked.  The waitress was kind enough to have the kitchen remake it but when I got my burger back, the egg was still more done than I would've liked as well as the burger patty itself. Remember, I ordered it medium and it ended up being more well done.   Gordon Ramsay is an internationally renowned chef who has trained alongside greats such as Guy Savoy and Joël Robuchon and he opens a burger joint??  Some of his restaurants have received 3 michelen stars but yet....here, his staff could not get a fried egg, nor a burger done right?  This makes me believe that this restaurant is purely a money maker for him because I felt ripped off and was disappointed that I bought into the hype.  Clearly, I wasn't impressed.

OMG! I wish we had a TopGolf here in San Diego. Please....come to San Diego!  We stopped in here while we were visiting family in Phoenix as a fun little day outing. I'm a big golfer so was a little hesitant on what this "Top Golf" was all about but it turned out to be SO MUCH FUN!  If you're not familiar with Top Golf, it's like a driving range on steroids. No, on crack! First off, the facilities were gorgeous and very well organized. You are greeted right when you walk in, there is an area to the right to check in and get your clubs if you don't have any--and then you're escorted to your private section. Each station has a terminal/computer where you enter the player names and the games you wish to play.    What I loved most was how each area was under a large covered patio to protect you from the elements and each had a very comfortable seating area with tables where you can sit, relax, order appetizers, drinks and even have a full blown lunch/dinner if you wanted. While everyone was ordering cocktails, I was so grateful they had an all natural Ginger Ale. I was going to town with those babies.   We had 4 people in our party and we all had different skill levels so the pre programmed games were perfect. I can't recall the names of the games we selected but random targets were given and each of us had a certain amount of balls to hit each one. The closer you got to the target, the more points you got. It was an absolute blast. I also had limitations because I'm preggo but it could not have been a more perfect outing for us. We were having so much fun, we played for hours.   The table service was fantastic and they're on it. As soon as our drinks or appetizers were getting low, they replenished quickly. We thought their prices on the food were pretty reasonable too. We thought we would only be there for an hour to play one game...we ended up spending hours there.   I'm sure we'll be back again during one of our annual trips out to Phoenix.

We stopped in here during our recent trip to Phoenix visiting family. Being from California, we are huge Peet's coffee fans and if your local to North County San Diego, Lofty Coffee (best coffee in SD) fans. We go out of our way to frequent either of them when we are looking to get our fix.   The two gals that were working on this Sunday morning were really sweet and thankfully, they just had a huge rush so we were the only ones in line. They took their time to tell us about their coffee and how they roast their organic coffee beans etc. It showed they really cared about their job and the art of making coffee. We really appreciated that and it was very cool to see.  My husband got a 2% latte and since I'm prego, I got a small skim decaf latte just to sip as I was slowly weaning myself off of coffee at the time. My husband absolutely loved his latte and because I was just sipping, he ended up taking mine too.He never does that because I always do skim milk and he says skim milk makes the coffee taste watered down so I was surprised.  Luckily I got a few sips in before it was stolen but we were not only happy with our drinks, we were thrilled with the service we received.  We've since told our Auntie and Uncle who live around the corner from this coffee shop to give this place a try--and they've come to love it too. They're still Starbucks loyalists but hopefully they'll see the light soon. ; )  When we're in town visiting family again, we will definitely be coming back.
