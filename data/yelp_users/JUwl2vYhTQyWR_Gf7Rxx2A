Fast delivery and good food! I ordered from Dragon Bowl on August 7th, 2015. I ordered at 4:30pm and in ten minutes the delivery girl zoomed over wearing a Superman shirt! :D I had the sweet n sour chicken, egg fried rice and crab puffs. Contrary to a few reviews on here, I wasn't overcharged, which is a good thing. The sweet n sour chicken was yummy, as were the veggies that came with it. I was so full that I had leftovers. The egg fried rice was pretty good. The crab puffs were okay. I would definitely order from them again if I'm in North Phoenix again. :)

I went to this Filiberto's this morning. I ordered a breakfast burrito with ham, eggs, cheese, onions and potatoes. Everything seemed okay until I was halfway through the burrito and found myself chewing on pieces of eggshells. I continued eating, avoiding the general area where I had found the eggshells, but found a little more a couple minutes later. I couldn't finish the rest. Also, the eggs weren't that good. I won't be coming back to this Filiberto's.

This place is great - a bit pricey, depending on what you're ordering. The food is yummy! I had their California rolls - they were so good I asked for seconds. I also had their pork egg rolls, which were also good. My friend ordered these fried shrimp things and he liked them too. I also had their Choclitini, basically their chocolate martini - it was yummy and strong - I'm a lightweight, so it only took me one to get me buzzed. To top it off, I had their fried banana with ice cream and that was very delicious! I would definitely come back!  :)
