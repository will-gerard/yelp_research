I used to go to the LA on Power and Germann and genuinely liked it.  I recently moved to Scottsdale and this gym is only a mile from my house.  I'm having a hard time getting to like this place.  It smells most of the time, people constantly don't re rack their weight (this is honestly such a big problem that it pisses me off to the point where I rage lift and have made some legit gains.  That's the only reason I gave it that second star.), there's only 3 benches and 3 squat racks that some idiot is doing curls in, and there's always sweaty paper towels littered all over the free weight section.  If I didn't have an $80 deactivation fee, I'd leave and go to Independence Gym.

I live right around the corner and needed a quick cut.  Walked right in and let Justin do his thing.  He gave me a nice fade and a beard trim along with some nice conversation.  He's had the shop since the 70's and definitely knows what he's doing.  I'll definitely become a regular here.
