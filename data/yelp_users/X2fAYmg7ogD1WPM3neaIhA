Today I went in with my younger sister and her friend because we were gifted free drink cards from another Jamba Juice. After ordering our drinks we handed the cashier the cards and she ran with out saying anything to her manager, then after coming back the manager told us the cards had been expired for 4years? Which completely made no sense because the cards were just given to us from a separate Jamba Juice and has no expiration date. She just sorry these don't work and walked away. What terrible service, didn't even apologize for us driving all the way to this location and offered no compensation. Just made us feel like idiots with her condescending attitude.  I will never come here again  You'll be disappointed with the lack of respect the employees give you.

My experience with this salon was not a fun one to say the least...  Called them at 10:00 AM and asked when the best time to schedule me in an appointment and the woman on the phone said 4:15 PM  So I walked in at about 4:13 and no one even noticed I was there, as well as there was no where to sit, so I kind of just stood awkwardly in front of the door since the place was packed (good sign). I finally got someone's attention who was with a customer and told them I had an appointment at 4:15 he called a woman over to me and she said they were running a little late, it'll be about 10 minutes  That was fine until 10 minutes turned into me waiting until 4:55 and just walking out.  They let people who had scheduled appts after me go ahead of me and that was a slap to the face. I really wish someone could have been honest to me or paid attention to me. BUT I went to Pretty Little Nails right down the street and they did an amazing job so it definitely turned my whole day around, they had such a nice salon!

If I could rate this experience lower than one star I would. I went in because I was experiencing an extremely sore throat for over a week, my right tonsil was covered in white spots and my right ear felt large amounts of pressure (tmi I'm sorry) I had a fever of 102 every night and I was in bad shape. I explained all of this to the nurse practitioner I saw, I do not remember her name but she was short and had short hair like a guys haircut. She then proceeded to look at my tonsils and my ears. While she was doing so she kept saying " yep you got the crud I'm sorry to tell ya" then said "you have food stuck in your tonsils that is why they are so enlarged and look that way"  I told her that I have never heard of food being stuck inside the tonsils. I asked her to give me a strep test, so another lady came in and swabbed my throat but it wasn't your normal throat swab she jabbed the Qtip into my mouth, with an attitude like she was upset to be doing it!(very awkward experience) So 10 minutes later the original practitioner came back in saying it was just a viral cold and sent me off saying there was nothing she could do. I decided to go to a different urgent care that was down the street and the man I saw was shocked by my tonsils and my ear was filled with fluid and come to find out, I have a severe case of tonsillitis and had to rush to the hospital! I couldn't believe 30 minutes earlier some lady told me it was a virus and that I had FOOD in my TONSILS.  If you care about your family, your children, your friends, just people in general, DO NOT GO HERE. You will be told ludicrous  statements and have your sickness/pain swept under the rug, so they can shove "viral infection" down your throat.  I will never go here again, and I hope to god that the woman who told me I have food in my tonsils reads this and gets her license taken away because she absolutely does not deserve to be a practitioner. I am also giving her the benefit of the doubt, that she is actually ignorant and doesn't know better. I really don't want to think she purposely lied to me.
