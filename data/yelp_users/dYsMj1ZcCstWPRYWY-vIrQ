Love the drinks, love the happy hour! 99 cent house margaritas could you go wrong with this? They also have large drinks you can share. The food is always awesome. Service could be better but it's not bad. We are frequent diners here.

GREAT DEALS- both for selling and buying. I think people don't realize these items we bring in are used items. After you buy anything the value of the item greatly depreciates-and by selling to a third party who sells our items the profit margin is very small. But it's still much more than you get from donating or simply throwing out these items. I'd recommend buying and selling- you WILL ALWAYS get more for in-store credit than simply taking cash. They tend to fill up on infant clothing the quickest I would recommend bringing it in right before the change of the new season to have the best luck. They store sells items in great condition some things are still new with tags which is always a steal! They have great equipment items and they're very knowledgeable about the items so it's easy to have your questions answered.   If you're not sure what to bring call the store. They can let you know the seasons and big items they need so you have better luck selling. I don't live close so I always call before making the trip to see what they need.

Well won't be back, apparently on Mon-Wed it's league day so the public can't bowl after 4:30 PM. Maybe you shouldn't send me so many advertising emails if you block at your entire bowling alley. Or put a note on the door. The front counter guy basically said tough luck, that's fine. Tough luck we won't be back. There are other places that actually want business from the public.

So very pleased with this dentist office! Went in today, for my first consultation it's run my a family and a very small, calm, and professional office. The staff was knowledgeable and helpful and made coming to the dentist a wonderful experience. I would give 5 stars, however there was an issue with my insurance and the front staff misquoted me by $300 the total bill. This was quickly resolved and upon realizing their mistake agreed to take a payment at a later date. I was referred my a friend and would definitely refer them to you!

And it keeps getting worse. Still not impressed with Texas Roadhouse. Food was not cooked correctly again. And the service was simply awful. Again I asked for a medium steak and it came out completely rare. Not one ounce was pink, instead it was bright red and clearly not cooked to a medium preference. I had to search for our server after 15 minutes post food not checking in to send it back. When they brought it out, it wasn't hot but warm but at least it was cooked. Service and food seem to be going down hill hopefully it will get better soon. Until then, I don't plan on visiting for awhile...

My  last stop before donating my clothes, I go everywhere first and then stop here. Don't expect to get much for items the in-store credit is mildly decent but if you take the cash it will be 50% less than that offer. Again, I'd recommend trying somewhere else first and taking the items they passed on to this location. It is always dirty and the racks are stuffed making it near to impossible to look at anything.

Pretty awful, so glad I was the visitor and not the patient I couldn't imagine having to stay in this place. The hospital looks very old and dirty. The staff is flakey and very difficult to get a hold of. When you do finally get to ask a question, they forget to come back or ignore the question. Nursing assistant chomped on her gum the ENTIRE time she was taking my mother's vitals. I would never elect to go to this hospital. My poor mother had no choice I would strongly urge against going to this hospital for care if at all possible.

Amazing words don't describe the food! First time here and it didn't disappoint. The restaurant is quaint and unique. None of the settings match, which adds to the appeal. Although the service wasn't the best, the restaurant was extremely busy and I think that has a lot to do with the quality of service we received. I recommend checking it out, it's well worth it.

SO much fun! I went here last weekend and had a total blast. The staff and crowd are beyond friendly. If you're looking for cheap well made drinks, and a great environment check it out! There is a cover, which doubled as a drink voucher so no big deal. The Drag show on Friday's rocks!! Worth stopping by.

Hotel is beautiful, however not impressed with this restaurant- mediocre  food, slow service, took forever for someone to finally take our order. Food was cold, I personally wouldn't recommend this restaurant or eat here again.

It's all about the therapist. Find one that is a good match, and I guarantee you'll be very happy! I see Hector about once a month and have a membership there. You can use your credits at any location, I've used them in Flagstaff and other states while out of town. However compared to the other locations Moon Valley is by far my favorite. The front staff is pretty consistent, I've only had one issue that was quickly resolved; and have not experienced anything similar since.

Not happy at all...my therapist left and I only found this out by calling into Massage Envy to reschedule my appointment. My appointment was in just 2 days...when I asked when they we're planning on letting his clients know they explained "they were busy" and we're getting to it. I've been a faithful goer for nearly 18 months but don't like being informed last minute of major changes. Trying to find an appointment for the same time as planned was also nearly impossible-I specifically asked for that time with my work schedule, I understand that people leave but that isn't my fault as a client and telling me that you can no longer do my appointment time after I moved my work schedule around it is simply unacceptable. I will be canceling my membership tomorrow after I use my last prepaid and will be looking for another company.

Talk about a complete 360...Brittany the Sales Manager and Aaron a therapist are the ONLY reason I didn't cancel my membership. I went in this afternoon with every intention of canceling my membership, Brittany offered a sincere apology for what had happened and offered to make it up to me. Aaron was wonderful not only was he professional but he was wonderful at his job and I left feeling like I could run a marathon (I won't) but I feel like I could... Why five stars? Because having a great therapist means nothing if you're not valued as a client. Brittany ensured I felt appreciated  as a customer and made this  by far the best experience I've had thus far.

What's not amazing about this place? The food is amazing, drinks, and servers are usually great. Had a less than pleasing server 1 of the 5,000 times we've been there so can't take off for that. They have alternatives for your less than adventurous friends. Try the Med. Chicken Pita-- one of my favorite dishes!

Never had such a poor experience. Took nearly 2 hours for a delivery order. After being quoted 35-45 minutes called in an hour later to find out the pizza was ready and should be on its way. Called back 30 minutes later to find out there was an entry error and it was never sent out. Due to the pizza inedible from being so cold the manager had to have the pizza remade. Now almost two hours later hoping our pizza will arrive soon....   Can't say we will be ordering from Papa John's again.

This is our favorite location, we've always had wonderful and attentive service and the food has been great. It's Chili's we don't expect a five course meal but it's a great spot to catch dinner or lunch. The bar drinks are inexpensive and usually pretty yummy, the bathrooms are kept clean and if you have any problem the managers are very quickly at your table to address it.

I recently stayed at the pointe and went to Rico's for a birthday dinner. We had David as a server he was fantastic. Personable, attentive, prompt, overall we had a wonderful time. I would highly recommend the Pasta Del Mar it was delicious and the kiddos liked that a cookie came with the kids meal.   We were not impressed with the hostess she wasn't very friendly but everyone else throughout the evening was excellent.

The overall experience was great, the artist was personable and relaxed. Decent pricing, shop minimum is based on the work which I completely agree with. My only concern is with the healing, took care of the tattoo like the said. However, it began to fade after it healed and my once all black tattoo now looks like it has been shaded instead. Although their staff is great as well as the artwork the actually tattooing, wasn't the best quality. I think it was more of the artist not the shop.

I will never go back here again! Went here to celebrate my birthday, they refused to let one of our guests in stating his out of state license was a fake- with no proof and couldn't give us any explanation. The bouncer was rude and our guest had to go to back to our hotel to get his passport which clearly states the same information and come back to Old Town Scottsdale. I say stay clear it's not worth the hassle.   The staff is on a HUGE power trip!

SO very impressed with the student stylist I had, Chelsea is great! I got a relaxer, trim, blow dry, and straighten. I have had my hair done by various salons, and stylist however, this BY far is the best experience I have had. It's a little noisy (the students are young and having fun) but the work was great. I'll definitely be back!

Such a cute shop! I wish I wasn't so far away though, the staff is always friendly and the drinks are great! I you don't like coffee they have a great variety of alternatives the staff is knowledgeable and it's an overall "hip" vibe. If you're near the Arcadia area check it out!

Meh.   Basically describes it. Food, service, and drinks are all mediocre. I tried a Daiquiri and it was disgusting, I'm pretty sure it was just rum with  a few strawberries and NOTHING else. The computer chairs are terrible to sit in and awkward if on a date, I'd recommend booking online or going early to get the lounge chairs with trays. However, even those are not the most comfortable. I go back purely because they have a lot of Groupons, probably to draw in more business as I see and agree the reviews aren't very good. I'd recommend AMC Esplanade over Studio Movie Grill or even IPic if you are looking to dine while you watch a movie.

I wish I could give more stars this place is amazing! The cupcakes taste like heaven, tried the key lime cupcake which is seasonal and was impressed. The service is fast, staff is awesome. Very accommodating and patient, if you're just not sure what to order.

Hit or miss, it's has a great selection in smaller sizes. Sometimes lacking in size large, but again it's a hit or miss sometimes they have a better selection near the season change it tends to be slimmer pickins. Staff is almost always friendly and they frequently do contests/giveaways on Facebook or Instagram.

I can't give five stars purely because I haven't physically been there, I've only had take out through work. So I can't say how the service is but the food is amazing!! It was very Chipotle style but with enchiladas. I love that you can do call ahead orders very practical for being in downtown phoenix next to a ton of business. I recommend checking it out, ASAP I loved it!!

Great product- terrible customer service. Why have a friendly "child" atmosphere of you're not equipped to handle children! After passing this on the way home we decided to make this our first outing as a little family (we have a brand new baby). Walked in weren't greeted when there was no one else at the front counter. Didn't explain how anything worked, couldn't figure out where the sample cups were. Thank goodness the yogurt and toppings were delightful otherwise it would be 1 star worthy. After finishing our ice cream it was time to change our newborn. Come to find out both bathrooms and no changing table. Why even have kids chairs and tables when you have no place for me to change my child. Disappointed, it's 2016 get with the program. We won't be back- unless your staff becomes friendlier and you get a changing table.

I thought the service was fantastic, one of the girl's who works here is super friendly. I didn't have a donut go figure but my family did and said they were amazing. Wish they had a bigger selection. If you want a good selection my advice is go earlier, they sell out quickly. I have to agree with some of the others posts which is why I took off a star, great donuts terrible coffee. The coffee was overly sweet, but also bitter and gave me  an upset stomach. I would say eat the donuts pass on the coffee.

Used Posh Rides, LLC for a birthday party. Driver was prompt, reliable, attentive, and personable. Would highly recommend this service to anyone in the Phoenix area we were very pleased with the service. The pricing is very comparable to Uber XL and definitely worth every penny!

I love this place! I found a brand new Michael Kors bag for just $199.00 which is a steal considering that these retail for twice that much! Great brands, great selection, and the owner, buyer, and staff are always very friendly. They have great sales and have new merchandise constantly going through their racks. They feature sizes XS-XL in Women's and similar clothing sizes for Men. I am always able to find both me and my husband great deals. The store is always clean and well organized, and the overall experience is fun. I definitely recommend checking it out- you can literally save up to 80% off the retail price.

So impressed with this new location! It's much roomier than the other locations, you have room to paint, look, and shop without feeling cramped. The staff is very helpful- I ended dropping my piece and rubbed off/smeared the majority of the BLACK puffy paint. Grayson helped me scrape it off and it ended up looking like it did before the mess up. I would highly recommend the classes, very informative, fun, and a great deal. If you're looking for something fun to do I would definitely check it out!

I wish it was possible to give more than 5 stars. We were that impressed with Rebecca. She was our doula for the birth of our son February 2016. She was patient, kind, and willing to answer every question we had. (Which trust me was a ton). She is so incredibly comfortable to be around and prepared us for the birth of our son. She assisted in writing our birth plan, offered birth photography, and placenta encapsulation. Which I highly recommend! As a first time mom placenta encapsulation saved my life.   Not only is Rebecca easy to be around she truly cares. Our birth by no means followed our birth plan. But Rebecca made it possible, she was there to get us through labor and got us trough needing a c-section  as well. Highly, highly recommend setting up an interview with Rebecca. You will not be disappointed! She was such a blessing during the birth of our son.

AMAZING! Introduced to El Jefe through a friend and fell in love with my first class. If you're looking to challenge yourself this is the place to go. The coaches are encouraging and give you the drive to want to finish the workouts. I've done things I never imagined I was strong enough to do. Just started on the journey with them and they have me more than excited for the results. It's truly for any fitness level, they teach you the workouts and work with you. Everyone there has been incredible and so nice.
