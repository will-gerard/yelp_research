A favorite date night place.  I had a hefe, the corn fritters and the deep fried artichoke.  Heaven in my mouth.  The only problem was our server was a tad spacey and repeatedly forgot my husbands salad.  Management ended up comping it since it didn't arrive until well after we finished eating, so NBD.

The hubby and I have decided to branch out and try new places, so when i saw that Woody's BBQ offered a deal on Groupon, I thought "Perfect! A new place AND a deal!" I wish I could go back and slap myself. It was THAT bad. We had high hopes upon first entering. The establishment was clean and the kid manning the front was friendly and took us to our table. Our waitress came out and took our drink order and was back in less than 2 minutes with our pitcher of beer. We decided to try the Family Feast for 2, which included brisket, ribs, chicken, BBQ beans, grilled corn on the cob, fries, coleslaw, and Texas Toast. Our waitress wrote down our order and told us it would be up in about 15 minutes. We didn't see her again for the entire 25 minutes it took for our food to come out. She, along with the rest of the staff, completely disappeared from view. No one came by to check on us, ask if we needed a water refill, etc. When our waitress finally came back with our tray of food, I was instantly disappointed. It just didn't look good. The coleslaw was runny, the ribs were tiny, the chicken was BRIGHT pink, the brisket was dry, and the "Texas Toast" was 4 pieces of soggy white bread. We tried to eat it. We really did. And anyone who knows my husband knows he will eat pretty much anything. But after ten minutes of trying bites of each thing, we ended up just sharing the basket of fries. Another thing that bugged us was before our food arrived, we couldn't find anyone who worked there to save our lives. But while we were eating there were at least 5 employees standing near our table just WATCHING us eat (or should I say, trying to eat). It was like they wanted to gage our reaction with each bite we took. It was unnerving to say the least. After asking for the check, we gave the girl our Groupon, some cash and left. Once we got home, maybe it was that we had psyched ourselves out on how bad the food was, but neither of us felt good and we both went to bed with stomachaches. Or maybe it was just that we were still hungry since the food was inedible.

My hubby and I came here tonight for our weekly date night - and we will definitely be back!  The service by Vann was awesome!  His knowledge of the different beers was vast and he did not steer us wrong with that beef stew (mmmmm)! The beer battered cod was divine.  The hubs is extremely picky about his Fish n Chips - he said they were the best he has ever had.  I will highly recommend this establishment to everyone we know!!

Cheap drinks, great bartender, close to home - gets a thumbs up from me.  The bands that have played are pretty good as well.  The only complaint? Get a bouncer or someone who will kick out the creepers!  When I say "no" to dancing with you, it means "no" not "come back in 15 minutes and try again".
