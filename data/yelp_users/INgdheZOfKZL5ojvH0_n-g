Authentic Japanese Service is great: quick and friendly! I have been here a few times and the fish always tastes very fresh especially for being a sushi place in the valley.   I always enjoy getting a seat at the sushi bar so I can talk it up with the chef. for the adventurous: Ask the chef to make you their own specialty dish, my taste buds have never been disappointed!

One of my favorites places to grab a delicious Cheeseburger and practically any type of hot dog.  Don't be scared if there is a line it moves quickly and its well worth the wait! Their milkshakes and cheese fries are pretty tasty aswell!

I Love this place. It is by far the best Italian deli in AZ. I have been here numerous times and never once have I had a bad experience.  The guys who work there are always very nice and helpful.  They have lots of food  and beverage options!  I recommend the caprese salad and any of their sandwiches. SO delicious   The only down side is that when they are busy, the long line can also mean a long wait before you actually get your food.

Service was great, servings are large and just about everything is delicious! If you're a hummus lover then you'll love this place!  The only bad thing I have to say about Fez is that we were seated outside and there was only one heater and it was located at the opposite end of the patio. Burrrrrrr!

I had the lamb and it was ever so tasty- came with a great plum sauce. We also tried- Lobster mac&cheese (kind of oily but still good) Spinach (tasted a little too charred and bitter...) French onion soup (a solid good soup)  Our waitress was very nice but once we ordered our appetizers she did not return for at least 25 minutes and even then we had to tell her we planned on ordering actual entrees.. I don't know if she assumed we were only getting appetizers because we are young and maybe the clientele is typically ritzy old people (there was a couple celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary next to us). Granted I underestimated how classy this place was and came dressed in jeans and converse shoes but that is still not a reason to assume anything.   Waiting a long time to put our order in meant waiting even longer for it to be cooked and served to us we managed to order,eat, and pay the bill just under two hours...

This place was OK. I walked in on a Thursday night and it was just about empty.  The idea of it sounds better than the actual place.  The outside decor looks kind of neat with all the bottles.  Seated ourselves and eventually the bartender/acting waiter came over to take our orders.   They have a happy hour which is nice but it was for bottom shelf liquor... I want to spend money on a decent drink, not  a below-average drink that is usually already cheap to begin with.  ATTENTION PATRONS: $4 Drink is now $3 Drink!   I ordered the chicken tenders with what I think was their house Ranch. My boyfriend ordered fries and something else...  I didn't like any of the two entrees nor the appetizer from this place.  (Tasted stale and over breaded)   Definitely Skip this place if you are hungry and want some good food.

I highly recommend this place!   Service was phenomenal! everyone was super friendly and gave good food recommendations!   I went here with a girlfriend, we order some bruschetta appetizers, Riesling, and I was so glad that they offer Frambroise Lambic Fruit Beer because I am not a typical "beer" fan in anyway shape or form.   Food is tasty, Drinks come in great assortment, & Vibes are slightly intimate, but very chill!

The only reason I am not giving them ONE star is because our waiter provided excellent service. The place has an unpleasant fish aroma... the swordfish was good compared to the over cooked and bland Ono fish I ordered.   our tuna appetizer took 20 minutes to finally get to our table but at least our waiter offered us bread while we waited.   The best thing about this restaurant was the YELP offer ( $1 for your first drink if you check in on Yelp)

I went here with a group of 7 on a Saturday night.  We we're greeted as we walked in and told to sit where ever we'd like. The wooden architecture is really beautiful and creates a cool vibe in the restaurant.  I loved this place because you don't have to yell over the music to hear each other : )  It also happened to be Acoustic night, there was a gentleman playing a guitar and singing some good popular tunes. Both of the appetizer dips (hummus, Cheese) were really tasty and their pizzas tasted fresh and yummy!   My friends and I are by no means savants when it comes to wine or beer but they seemed to carry a good selection of both.  I would recommend checking out their menus on their website to know if they carry what you like. I was slightly disappointed that they were out of two of the four desserts they carried. I ended up getting the honey orange mousse, which tasted a little bland once the drizzle of honey was gone... The service was very quick and all of the employees were super polite. I would definitely Dine and Wine here again!

I have been here multiple times and usually it is Grand - inviting hostess, friendly & informative staff, yummy food, etc... but the last time I went there were only two servers working that night and right as the server/hostess was seating us another table broke a glass so she just dropped the menus on the side of the sushi bar and said she would be right back.  Granted, a broken glass does require immediate attention and could take a few minutes to clean up but then the server forgot to come back to us for about 10 minutes.... We ended up asking the sushi chef for a pencil to mark what we wanted and flagged down the waitress to take our order, which we had to bring up that we wanted something to drink and two miso soups. She brought the waters and then she announced "here is ONE of your miso soups". The other soup eventually came out after our first sushi order did.   We had to stop the waitress for some chopsticks then realized we didn't have napkins so called for her again and then realized we didn't have any plate or sauce dishes so we called for her again, and then realized we didn't have any soy sauce and called for her yet again...at this point I felt like we were bothering her and did not dare ask to get a refill on our drinks.    It was just very odd because the waitress acted as though they were super busy only having two waitresses but there were only three other tables seated while we were there.   The good thing is that they have HAPPY HOUR (ALL DAY, EVERY DAY) unfortunately, we did not know this since they still keep their happy hour menus with specific times at the table... whaaa whaaa  The food is good (I recommend the surfer roll) and the chefs are cool to talk to.

stopped in for something to eat before a concert.  Their fried pickles were almost just batter with the slightest bit of sliced pickle...  The meatloaf was recommended to me by the waitor... it tasted as if they bunched together a bunch of meatballs and put some marina on top.  green beans were very stringy and tasted as if they were straight from the can to the microwave to my table.   My 3 friends and I did not care to finish our food even though we were hungry because it tasted pretty bad...  However the workers were very friendly and nice.

This place was pretty chic. I went here with a gal friend and both our feet and nails looked great afterwards. (my nail polish stayed perfectly intact for a solid 4 weeks!)  I went with the root beer float pedicure but also added a few more services on top. you're able to enjoy refreshing root beer, margarita, water or beer whatever your preference.  As a surprise bonus, a neighboring restaurant brought in cupcakes samples- YUM! The lady who did our nails is the owner/creator of this modern boutique lounge and she was very nice. They offer a great deal of 50% off found here on yelp!   The downfall- 1. There is only one chair for pedicures and one for manicures, so me and my friend had to take turns waiting for the other one to finish... however I guess that shouldn't matter if you have the time to kill.  2. The nail polish color choices are very limited.
