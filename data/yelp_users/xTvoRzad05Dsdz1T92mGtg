The lines are absolutely terrible for the mediocre , way to sweet coffee drinks. The staff is nice but know nothing about personal bubbles. They basically become an extra passenger in the car and it's annoying.

Took my boyfriend there for his first Pho experience. He was a fan. The staff was so friendly the food was amazing and they were very accommodating to me as a vegetarian. The prices were great too. They prefer cash since they are a small business but take card. I'll definitely be going back.

Awesome helpful staff! Very messy but very delicious. I wish there were plates and utensils handy but I think that's part of they Louisiana feel they're going for.
