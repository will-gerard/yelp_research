We had a group reservation for The Old Town Tortilla Factory, that was great. The problem was that was about all that was great about the place. The credit card machine in the bar was down for the time we were waiting for our table, chips and salsa was $7 and the food was not really good at all. I had asked our waitress about two items and she suggested the restaurants signature dish Pollo Margarita, stuffed chicken breast with chiptole mashed potato cake and seasonal vegetables. The chicken was extremely dry the stuffing was bland and the mashed potato cake was the same bland and dry. The only thing good to eat was the freshly made tortillas.

I was in town with a group of friends and had a reservation on the recommendations for The Keg Steakhouse by friend of the groups. I believe that not a single one of us was disappointed. The decor is modern and sleek. The wait staff were on top of things and extremely knowledgeable of the menu and recommendations and the food spoke for itself.   I had a blue cheese wedge salad and the NY strip with the blue cheese spread and the three mushroom mixture. Cooked perfect to my request, the blue cheese and mushrooms were a great add, via the waiter and the salad was prepared in the classic manner.   Great experience especially with a group of 16 people!

The aloft is great idea and progression in hotel design. If you are a fan of modern design you should check out this hotel. Plus In-N-Out is across the street and they start serving at 10am, not a bad breakfast after a night on the town!

Well you can say that I'm a little biased but this is one of the best spring training facilities around. The tickets were decent price for great seats. There were many concession stands, bathrooms and services in the stadium were amazing. the make up of the complex was well thought out and having fields that are exact replicas of Dodger Stadium and US Cellular Field will help out the Dodgers and White Sox in there development. Just a great place to spend a spring at! Go Blue!
