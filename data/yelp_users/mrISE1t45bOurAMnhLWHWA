I have seen three different doctors at this office and each one has been fabulous!  Dr. Francyk is amazing, intuitive and really takes the time to listen to your complaints.  I really appreciated how much time he took with me.  I've had doctors that took a rushed 5 minuted to "listen" to my concerns and then just wrote me a script and sent me on my way.  Dr. Francyk was different.  He looked me in the eye when I spoke to him and I knew he was really hearing me.  He spent quite a bit of time explaining possible treatment options and I finally feel like I have a doctor that cares and knows what he's doing!!!  I've seen a lot of complaints about the admin fee of $49/year....but if I need to pay a small fee to have a great doctor and staff on my side, I'm okay with that.  I know a bit about health insurance and primary care doctors really struggle to stay afloat.  No wonder most of them treat their practice like a factory, churning out patients every five minutes.  If the stupid admin fee helps give me more time with my doctor, I'm all for it!  Thank you Dr. Francyk for all your help!

I just love this place.  The food is like real sit-down mexican but you can get it pretty fast on the go.

My boyfriend and I ordered dinner to-go last night and it was pretty terrible.  They said our order would be ready in 20 minutes, but by the time we got home it occurred to me that it was probably ready in more like 5 minutes and sat there for a while and everything got cold and dried out.  My boyfriend's new york strip steak was thin and gray.  My chicken was cold and dry and my loaded mashed potatoes were dense and cold all the way through.  I realize that take-away food will never be as good as if you order at the restaurant, but even if we had eaten it there, I'm pretty sure it would have been mediocre at best.  This place is gross and we will never go back.

I've been to numerous Valle Luna locations and the food is consistently good.   This is a reasonably priced, casual place to get some mexican food.  I went last night, though, and all the bus and chip boys and girls were too busy playing grab-ass with each other to refill our chips.  Just thought I would throw that out there in case management is reading.  I thought it was entertaining if anything. Waitress was excellent though.

These guys just painted my condo (interior) and I couldn't be more impressed.  The price was fantastic and the work impeccable.   I used a variety of accent colors and they did a great job on the seams.  I couldn't be happier.  Thanks, guys!

I am writing this review based mostly on how terrible your on-demand menu is.  All your menus are terrible and antiquated.  Your on-demand menu in particular looks and functions like it's from the early 90s or it was built by effing idiots.  You can't tell what episode is what in the menu, what season it's for, when it originally aired and there's no information on what it's about.  Epic fail cox.  Netflix can do it, itunes can do it, HBOgo can do it...the list goes on.  WTF Cox?  Fix your s#!t.

I chipped my front tooth pretty badly when I was only 13 and it has been a constant issue over the years.  I've had 4 different dentists do bonding on it (it needs to be re-done every couple of years) and have had mixed results with shape and color.  I've never been really happy with the results.  I was recently referred to Dr. Peck by my orthodontist to have my front tooth bonding repaired, yet again.  I am absolutely amazed by Dr. Peck's work!!!  This tooth has never looked so beautiful since it has been chipped.  The product he used is high quality and life-like, the color is a near perfect match and the shape is beautiful.  He even took me outside to examine the coloring in real light to match it as close as possible to the neighboring front tooth.  I am blown away by Dr. Peck's attention to detail and skill.  The staff was very friendly and went out of their way to get me an appointment when I needed it.  I highly recommend Dr. Peck and his team for restorative dental work.

George did an amazing job on my carpets and sofa.  He was super nice and punctual, which I appreciate.  Also, the price was very reasonable.  I waited for my carpets to dry before posting this so I could really see how they turned and and they look fantastic; almost like new.  I would definitely recommend Paradise for your carpet and upholstery cleaning needs!

The cheese course and dessert are on point.  I love coming here (both locations) and have been many times, having lived in the phx area all my life.  I do have to say that the entree has always been disappointing...the meat is mostly flavorless and the sauces aren't very good. The terriyaki marinated beef is really good tho...because it was marinated and actually has flavor.  You can do better melting pot!  Marinate your food...2 minutes in a flavorful broth isn't enough time to infuse flavor into meat.

I come here over and over for my pedicures.  They have a ton of colors to choose from, very clean, and they do a nice job.  The tech I stick with most often is Tuey.  Also, if you pay in cash you get a discount.

Possibly the worst service I've ever received, which is surprising given the incredible number of humans walking around that really appear to work here despite the glazed over looks in their eyes and lack of any kind of attempt to offer service.  I sat at a table with an empty drink gor 30 minutes and nobody ever game over to see how we were doing.  The young cocktail waitresses are just walking around slowly, taking breaks to chat with one another... not making any eye contact and having no sense of urgency.  I will never come back here.

Great ambiance, excellent wait staff and the food was amazing.  I got the chicken and the portion was huge.  I think it was an entire half chicken.  I will say that the ratio of veggies and potatoes to chicken was a little low.  My party and I had a great experience overall.

I would give this 5 stars if they had a french toast for purists.  The deep fried stuff is not good...it's too crunchy and greasy.  I know people rave about it in other reviews...but I can't be the only one to not enjoy the french toast here.  Just make a regular soft, eggy grilled on the flat top in butter french toast, please!

Came here for the first time last Thursday.  The place is a lityle hard to find but that's not a big deal to me.  The meet and cheese plate was amazing.  My friend and I also split a burger with fries and a pizza.  She has a hollow leg, I swear.  Anyway, the food was great and everyone was really friendly.  Aside from the meet and cheese plate (to die for) I think the fries were my fave...super golden and crunchy on the outside...thin but not shoe-string...and I don't even like fries that much.  So there you have it!
