Went here for the first time and this is the best Italian restaurant I've ever been too..  Small family business that cares about making sure your visit is the best it can be

Nice job on the car today and as always can't beat the price!  And now that I had my windshield replace somewhere else they can't harass me about wanting to replace it  My only complaInt is they allow people to smoke out by the waiting area

Great office staff and top notch maintenance crew!  Since the current management took over a couple years ago it's been a great experience.

Bought my first car from Sanderson tonight.  My salesman, Mike Gilbert, was fantastic.  This was the most pleasant auto buying experience I've ever had.  Reached out to Mike through the Internet on Friday.  Told him what I wanted and and the obstacles we might encounter.  We had a deal in place on Saturday and I picked up my new ride tonight.  Great experience and I would recommend Sanderson to anyone looking for a car.

This McDonalds is the worst I've been too.  They're rude most of the time.  Something is always broke.  Can't make coffee....can't make ice cream.....they don't provide anything like napkins, straws, ketchup or anything else unless you ask.  And if you ask for more than one they want to charge you additional

This McDonalds is awful.  Not sure why I continue to go there.  They are either always out of ice cream or their machine is broke.  Drive thru is ridiculously slow especially late nights.    Order is often wrong....they don't always give out commonly used things like napkins, ketchup, straws unless you ask

Love the coffee and service here.  My only complaint are the customers who think it's a playground for their kids and dogs

Great coffee and service as usual.  The customers here continue to amaze me with their idiocies!

Food was mediocre at best.  Service was average.

I originally complained about this place a few months ago and the manager actually contacted me.  He offered to buy my next meal along with some other perks and I told him I would prefer he feed a homeless vet which he did.  I have since been back several times and had great service.  My only recommendation is to get there early on Sunday's because it gets packed quick!

Really good food.  Went there for lunch and it was enough food for two meals!  Great service too

I've had multiple problems with this office through the years.  Today was just another problem.  Douglas, the carrier, is the stereotypical postal worker.  Does the bare minimum and offers not help and plenty of attitude.

The chips might be the best I've ever had!  The mild salsa is also very good.  Not as chunky aa I like but not runny, which is good  The tacos have a great taste to them although there was too much cilantro for my liking.  I liked the chicken more than the carne asade.  The beef quesadilla was very good.  The tortilla was crisp and the inside was filled with goodness!  Location is kinda tough.  Luckily someone told me about this place.  I hope it survives!
