Imagine a Filliberto's sized menu selection, even larger, without the searing stomach pains post-meal. Throw in authentic southwestern Mexican dishes served quickly and a great bakery with a huge variety of fresh Mexican sweets and this place deserved five stars hands down. The menu selection is huge and won't break the bank.  My favorite items are the tamales (pork)with the green sauce, gorditas (gf's favorite), nopales (that's cactus and any self respecting southwestern Mexican restaurant will serve these) and the Mexican sweet breads (not brains, yuck). The food comes fast and my orders have always been right. There is a salsa bar that's always stocked. It's a dine in or take out establishment with no servers. There is also a small butcher, or carneceria, inside for finding cuts of meat for making fajitas or other tastey things at home.  Not a date place but perfect if you're looking for something with a couple of friends that will fill you up and not break the bank. It's on 12th Street and Van Buren so be aware of the area. I've lived in Central or South Phoenix my whole life so I'm used to it (aka my hood). It's open for bf, lunch & dinner. I've only had the latter two but they were muy yummy.   Oh and also I've seen that Super Burrito and it would feed a small village ... seriously. Also, even if you're taking it to go, wander over to the dining side while you're waiting the murals on the wall are funny.

Having passed this place more than once while driving around, I'd always wanted to stop by but never made it much of a priority. Well I stumbled across reviews here and due to the raving about the papusas I HAD to stop in.  My partner in crime was kind enough to accompany me and as soon as we did we too joined the pupusa bandwagon, mmm pupusa bandwagon (drools). We had the appetiser sampler which is good to share but might leave you wanting the another pupusa. I'm a fan of the chicken soup you get, but just wish the serving size was slightly bigger.  The appetizer comes with 3 different items and all are equally tastey (ref. pupusa). They also give you some cabbage salad and a tomato sauce to accompany the items, yum.  My gf ordered the recommended chicken dish and lurved the hell out of it, I agreed and actually was wishing I'd gotten that instead of the Salvadorian marinated steak, which was good, but paled in comparison to the chicken.  Sidenotes: Try the ensalada drink, it's a sweet fruit based drink that comes with slices of apple. Sort of reminds me of drinking a melted otter pop, which as far as I'm concerned is off the proverbial chain. Also served with appetiser and as a sidedish with the food was a bean soup which was good and great for dipping the tortillas in. Oh, and the tortillas are Salvadorian style meaning thick and sort of along the lines of a Mexican gordita, I could eat these for days.  Pupusas (drools) "give me a towel boy" (drools)

First a note, avoid during First Friday! Now I say that for two reasons. First, because it's overflowing with art-walkers, and not just kind of overflowing, I'm talking like Rush Limbaugh in an extra small halter top overflowing (uhuh, shutters). Also, maybe if enough people stop going I can start going. Feh I can wish can't I.  On all other nights it's perfect. Only bottled beer and wine by the glass/bottle so be aware no mixed drinks. Still though that shouldn't deter anyone. The house is a little hard to find but that just adds to the quaintness. The crowd is really laid back and age ranges vary which I like. It makes for better people watching. No Dos Gringos bruhs in Affliction shirts.  They have some neat niche beers and are usually throwing something new and different into the mix. The bartenders are nice and the prices are very fair. The music selection is good, no top 40 stuff. The atmosphere is nice and dark with exposed brick walls and good art from local artists.  Side note: There's a lock up area for bikes in front although it's limited, it's nice if you live in the area and want to bike for beers.

"Two words, iced mocha. They do it like your momma did pancakes. Well not like my momma, because that would be black and dry, and that just wouldn't make sense here at all.  Seriously, this has become my favorite coffee destination for the past half a year or so. I'm obviously a fan of the iced mocha but the hot beverages are just as tasty. The owner John, is always great to talk to and really inviting to anyone who steps in the door. The other baristas are very nice as well. Oh and the prices are really affordable. Which means more money to buy some of the cool things in the store with.  The shop is a co-op for artists to sell there goods so while you're waiting for your coffee there is plenty to have a look at.  It's a hard to find because it's right smack in the middle of an old historic area but well worth the search. There's not a lot of places to sit and seems more of a place to grab and go or grab and shop. Not really a watch me as I work sort of establishment (ala Starbucks).  Side note: The place is nuts during First Friday being that it's right smack in the heart of the art walk so be warned."

Let me preface this fact: I have eaten what could amount to a family of cows (that would be daddy cow, momma cow and 2.5 child cows) in carne asada during my life. Needless to say I like it. This doesn't make me an MD in C.A. but I've had really good (i.e. Yeah, I loved it so much I'd marry it.) and really bad (i.e. Truly thought I'd die.) and everything in between.  That said I'd place America's Taco shop squarely in the middle. Again, it's just my opinion but it was really nothing special. Maybe, and I say MAYBE, I was slightly thrown by the hype and was expecting too much.  That alone though wouldn't have merited my two stars. I eat at plenty of places with just-okay quality of food but I go back because of the atmosphere or service. But the fact that the wait was over 30 minutes for two tacos, a vampiro and a burrito was part of it.  Also, the help was less than, um, help. Two teenagers with that wonderful teen-approach to service. Example, not knowing exactly what an item includes. Lastly, the prices. A vampiro at most places is the size of a good portioned tostada. At A.T.S. however everything down to the burrito was half the size of what I expected, and pricier. I understand the tacos being small as is traditional for carne asada tacos but don't price them $3 a pop. I could get the same quality and half the price at Food City (no joke).  The seating was really limited so this place would probably be best for a pick-up order to avoid the wait.  The positives were that that the food came exactly as I'd ordered it and also they served elote (corn) traditional style which you don't see much outside of late night taco stands. Also, the place was clean and the small house it was built into was neat.

After reading a few reviews I was really tricked into thinking the portions would be minuscule. Like french-modern-cuisine tiny, but luckily I was wrong.   I erred on the side of thinking the portions would be small so I ordered us two starters but we could have just done with one. However, they were both drool-worthy. One was the baguette with creamy garlic, it consisted of  6 slices of bread with a whole garlic cooked until it's spreadable covered in olive oil and spices. Basically you scoop a clove out and spread it on the bread. This was good, like drool-on-you-keyboard-good (DOYKG). We also ordered the Nosh plate,a typical melon, meat, cheese and nuts plate. Everything on that was tasty and both would have been great alone, but I'm glad we tried both.  For main courses my gf ordered the mac and cheese with prosciutto and breadcrumbs and liked it. I had Vovo's special which is a rotating special. Last night it was the tamale and tortilla soup. We both liked our dishes and were stuffed. I was a little envious after seeing another couple's dish. They ordered the chicken and waffles. It wasn't your typical soul food style but it looked tasty regardless. We both had wine. Gf had the Rose which she thought was a little dry and I wasn't too fond of either. I had the Tempranillo which I liked but wasn't amazing. That's probably the only gripe, I wish their wine list was deeper.  All in all the place was awesome and a great date destination. Romantic lighting and original decor and architecture, good for conversation starters.  The crowd was older that I expected, not a negative just an observation, although it was a Thursday and that might change on weekends. The service was nice and the free after dinner snack. Chocolate covered cookie dough was like pastry crack and also (DOYKG).  Side note: The prices aren't cheap but they won't break you. Especially if you go to other establishments in the same area. My tab for this meal was $60 which is good I think. Two sides, two glasses of wine, one main course and one small course. Not bad as far as I'm concerned.

Is it me or did this place sort of just pop up without much promotion? Hm, just like most places downtown. Well, that aside, after passing it a few times and sticking my head in once I finally made it inside. It has an interesting, in a good way, atmosphere. dimly lit and well laid out with modern furniture and ample seating, not table seating but the comfy benches serve just as well.  The prices were on par with anything else in the Central Phoenix area and the selection was fine although there were some really low end wines that surprised me. I understand wanting to appeal to all crowds and not seem pretentious but with the semi-hidden location and the decor, it's sort of too late for that.  The crowd was mainly the after work happy hour group, but the ones too hip for Macayo's or Uno's. You know black rim glasses (guys) mod-retro clothes (girls).  It was decently busy but with plenty of open seating. My gf and I were able to find a nice place for some people watching. Mind you it was a weekday. The bartender was nice and everyone seemed to be having a good time. I'm curious to see what it's like on a weekend now. Definitely worth a try.  Come to think of it the place sort of reminds me of a swankier more grown-up version Shady's  (26th St. & Ind. School) even as far as the DVD's playing on tvs throughout. Sidenote: The Besame (Kiss me) wine was goooooood.

Hands down my favorite coffee shop in town. They used to be located inside the Conspire art collective but have now moved into the old Hood Rides digs up the block and it's awesome.  Plenty of seating room at the bar and also a really cool little room next door  where you can pull up a seat and hang out. From what I understand there will be seating outside too.  Most importantly however is the coffee. They use a special mix roasted specially by Cartel. I'll be the first to admit I'm no coffee connoisseur but I do know this, every drink I've had, no matter who's behind the bar has been perfect. Not burnt, not too sweet, and not a hint of pretentiousness.  Sooooo, why go to S-word Bucks when you can get a better cup of coffee up the street. Oh and for those of us who burn the midnight oil on more than a few occasions, they're open until 12am EVERY night.
