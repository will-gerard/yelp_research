How long can a ball roll downhill before it reaches the bottom? On the border has always been one of my favorite restaurants, but over the last couple of years it just keeps getting worse and worse. I walk through the door with a friend of mine and see an empty host stand. I wait for what felt like five minutes of seeing employees checking in on their tables and looking at me just standing there until finally someone shows up to seat me. Please take note and make sure someone is ALWAYS waiting to seat your guests. The service once we got to the table was amazing. Our server was very sweet and constantly checked in on drinks and chips and salsa, which was really the best part of the experience. The thing that absolutely pisses me off is that every single time I come in, I have to send my food back because the kitchen does not understand the concept of what a burrito is. The burritos here look like taquitos, small and skinny, with open ends.   Corporate America is downsizing portions everywhere, but it gets to the point where it's downright disrespectful to charge people for such an embarrassment. I really miss the days when I used to come here and get a large burrito, or even something that could be referred to as a 'burrito' for that matter.

Alas, it's finally over. It's the night where you have that final blowout fight with your significant other and you realize it's just not worth it anymore. We had the Steak and Chicken Fajitas and the portion size was enough to starve a small child. After calling over the manager, I realized that this location is doomed. He proceeded to argue with me over portion sizing and couldn't level with me that having a Fajita portion so small that you could only make 2 small tacos out of it was just not right. His only solution was to not charge me for the "extra" portion they brought out, which was also laughably small.   I've been going to On The Border since I was a little guy, and truth be told this experience just ruined it for me forever. Every time I go back the portions get smaller. The good news is that there are plenty of other locally owned places here in the area offering reasonable portion size, and care for their customers.   On The Border, R.I.P.

I walked into this place, sat down and then left after sitting there for about two minutes. The place is small, stuffy and void of any music, just dead quiet. I noticed there were about 10 orders in the window and no one appeared to have food. The menu was ratty and beat up with only a few items on it, none of which sounded great. I never even got a greeting. I'm actually grateful about it because I didn't feel so bad when I made a dash for the front door.   Not for me. Oh, not really sure how the reviews are so good, because I went to this place based on the 4 star rating. An Awkward deception.

I'm not sure how this business was able to muster a four star reputation when 75% of the staff is rude, incompetent, and has a "why are you bothering me, condescending attitude". Now, I will give the apparel department five stars because the seamstress and several of the other gals over there have been awesome. But my experience with parts and rentals was nothing more than rancid. I hate writing 1-star reviews, but when you continue to drop the ball and show no regard for poor customer service, you really have it coming.   For the parts department: expect to never get a call back when your parts are in. It took me 30 days to get a simple issue fixed with a short in one of my running lights because allegedly they ordered a European part, then on the second appointment the mechanic went home sick, delayed another few days, third appointment misquoted on pick up time and delayed the entire rest of the day.   For the rentals department: a friend of mine came in from out of town to visit and wanted to rent a Harley so we could ride and take in some views. We found the rental guy smoking a cig on the bench outside with a very unwelcoming look. As he showed us around and informed us that nearly every bike my friend wanted to rent either wasn't available for rent or they didn't have at this location, it became clear that we weren't going to get very far. Mid sentence the guy actually rushed off to help other customers without even saying he would be back or apologizing for just jetting. How rude. After giving these guys multiple chances, it's over for me.   Come here if you like rude staff and terrible experiences, again and again.

I found this place on Yelp! Let's be honest, there's really no other way you could find it. This little gem is tucked behind a Home Depot just off of country club nearby the interstate. The service is great and everything on the menu is amazing. I've been here many times since finding it with family, friends, and the girlfriend and we will continue to come in the future. The breakfast skillets are really good and you can never go wrong with the pancakes.   The only downside is that the way the tables are laid out in the restaurant does make it a little cramped. Especially be prepared to feel like people are super close to you if you come during breakfast time, as they tend to be quite busy!   Keep up the good work guys!!

A late night snack attack got the better of me and I wish it hadn't. Not because I felt like a shitty, horrible person for downing a thousand calories at night, I hadn't really eaten all day, but because "The Baconator", a so called premium sandwich, was blandanator. No flavor at all! My drink had flavor, however, just not the right flavor... I ordered a Sprite and what I got tasted like a mixture of Mountain Dew and a shitty explosion of limes.   The finale was being given drinks and no straws, as well as never being asked if I wanted any sauce to go with the chicken nuggets I ordered.   Note to self,  When you drive up and employees are screaming and acting a fool inside, keep on driving.

I hate writing one star reviews, but please be advised that if you come here you will wait forever.   This CVS is either understaffed in the pharmacy or its miserably slow, maybe both. Every time I come here the pharmacy is overrun and calling up to the front for help. To the manager, if you are not reading this and taking immediate feedback, you are going to lose a ton of business.   Tonight I had to wait over 2 hours for my prescriptions. I was told two hours and then when I called 2 hours and 10 minutes later they told me that it would be another 15 minutes. Seriously how long does it take?! And if it wasn't bad enough, the guy on the phone was copping serious attitude when I asked if they could just call me when they're done. I came in the other day and had to wait 30 minutes for them just to punch in my new insurance information. It just seems like every time I come in whether it is busy or not, the estimated wait time is an hour or two. These are countless hours of my life I will never get back. I don't care what your excuse is, that's just obscene to waste that much of people's time and then be rude to boot. Unacceptable.

This place was pretty clutch. My girl and I came here for some bomb Mexican food and we found just that! They start you off with a sexy little plate of chips, salsa, a white sour cream sauce (amazing), and some bean dip ( also amazing, especially when mixed with previously mentioned white sauce). We ordered the carne asada quesadillas, which were amazing, although a little on the overly cheesy side. If everything wasn't amazing enough, our entree came with free sopapillas! These come in either cinnamon sugar or plain. Always go cinny-sug.   Will be back to try the rest of the menu!

In and out. No, not the burger joint, that's how my experience went. Came in for lunch on a weekday with my parents and the first thing I noticed was the dead silence. No music - just the sound of clanking plates. There were only four tables and one of which was taking all of the attention of the two employees on shift. There seemed to be some issue with the bill with these folks so no one bothered to stop what they were doing to greet us or bring any water. Oh wait we did get a greeting, awkwardly on the way out as I told the owner we were leaving because it was too hot. He just stood there dumbfounded, as if he couldn't tell the temperature inside the restaurant was about 85 degrees.   I used to come to this place all the time when I lived in queen creek a couple years ago. Man has it gone downhill. Must be new ownership or something, because I've never had an experience like this here. And I'd also like to note that this is a prime location right on the corner - no reason for this restaurant to be empty. There's obviously something wrong going on here.

Houston's is as good as it gets! My favorite is the Hawaiian Rib Eye with a loaded baked potato. I always start with the spinach dip or the artichokes, sometimes both if my party is big enough. I always top it off with the ice cream sundae, which is just out of this world. Hot gooey fudge that you can pour on yourself and candied nuts.. mmmmmm...   My most recent experience was nearly ruined by a loud mouth wearing a T-Shirt and dining with a rather trashy looking gal. He was telling lude stories about his recent trip to Vegas and the volume of his voice was less than appropriate for the dimly lit, laid back atmosphere Houston's provides. I flagged down a server nearby and she kindly relocated me to the other side of the restaurant.   I really wish they had a dress code here to keep scrubs like that from ever ruining classy folk's meals. Thanks again though, to the staff!

I wanted to like this place but every time it's something different. Either they are out of cups, or out of the normal size tortillas, or they didn't put cheese on the Steak, egg, and cheese burrito. It's always something. This time I come home to find that one burrito is tiny and the other is normal. I just can't take the inconsistencies anymore. How disappointing.

This place is great! I was looking for an entry-level longboard and my girlfriend recommended this place to me. After checking out the reviews I decided to give it a try. I called and they didn't answer, so I decided to shoot on over since I wanted to browse in person anyway. The guy there was extremely helpful. I told him I was a rookie just looking for something to get started on and he pulled down 2 options for me. After testing them out I decided on one. I was super happy that he didn't overly inundate me with options and just kept it very simple. He helped me find a helmet and I was on my way. At the register I noticed there was a little wear on the board and he even gave me 10% off. For anyone looking to grab a longboard, or even get some wheels or trucks, I highly recommend Scottsdale Sidewalk Surfer! Thanks guys!!

I love this place! The environment is a total blast from the past - fun pictures on the wall, fun music, and a staff of enthusiastic employees. The food is great and the dessert is even better. Chocolate chip pizza cookie holds a special place in my heart!

This place has really gone downhill. It's so sad because it was my little treat to myself to be pampered with drinks and food while I enjoyed a quality movie. I came here last night and there were about 6 or 7 very awkward and impersonal employees behind the bar. My girl and I opened a tab and we're just hanging out until our movie started and at least 4 people in a row asked us if we wanted to close our tab. After telling 3 previous employees we wanted to keep our tab open, we finally decided on the 4th ask to close out. How annoying! Do you not understand the concept of an open tab? Everyone here looks frumpy and ungroomed. The whole staff needs a shower and a haircut. I also noticed the crowd is now a bunch of scummy looking people.   Now for the food: $8 for 5 boneless chicken bites. Ru fucking kidding me?  The theater: giant dividers between each row made it very difficult for me to see the screen.   In theater wait staff: Slow and incompetent.   We purchased tickets online for the 2d version of Star Wars and of course we show up and they tell us it's 3D. We were offered a refund but we had waited long enough to see the movie.   Conclusion: This theater is no longer worth the amount of money they charge. The wait staff is unpleasant and boring, you are no longer treated as high class to match the ticket price, crowd is a bunch of skanks.

A two and a half hour wait is enough to make any man or woman forget the agony from whence they came and realize the hell they're in. After suffering nearly two weeks with chest congestion, a full blown sinus infection, and terrible coughing, I decided the medication wasn't quite enough to quell the beast that was my sickness, I headed to the ER. HGTV and my girlfriend were really the only thing that got me through the long wait. I was really frustrated when I finally saw the doctor because although he was nice, he was in and out before I could even blink. I never even got to ask a single question. I wish they would work on this. I get that you're swamped, but don't forget that we sit and wait for hours just to get a second of FaceTime and then pay thousands of dollars in bills. You don't have to set up camp, but at least take the time to let us get some questions in.   The staff here is great. The business model, not so much. Mercy care has it set up that they'll get you back quicker than most places (most of The time) but you have to sit in the waiting room in the interim. This means that you don't get a bed in the back to rest in while you wait. You can decide whether you'd like the longer wait and s bed or somewhat shorter wait and no bed, but I just think it's weird.

Jason's deli is the bees knees. I always get the beefeater and the broccoli soup and leave feeling like a king. The best part is the free unlimited ice cream you get while dining in, so bring the kids! Or better yet, just leave them at home and get more for you!   As for this location itself, it's pretty solid and the food usually comes out pretty quick.

This place is one of those little gems that when you find it, you know you've struck gold. My friend and I found this little shop this past Monday when hunger struck us in the AM and we needed to grab a quick bite. The staff is extremely friendly and the prices are crazy cheap. You can get a breakfast burrito for about $3 and they are huge! They'll even give you free chips, and you can head over to the salsa bar and indulge as much as you want.   So far I've tried the Sausage, egg, and cheese b-fast burrito (add potato) and the Carnitas burrito, which has provided comfort given the ongoing Chipotle debacle and their nationwide shortage of "Properly Raised" pork. Will be back to try more :)

Love this place. It's clean and there are a ton of cardio machines, so you'll never have to wait. However the free weight area is always jam packed (as is with most gyms) which leaves me waiting for quite a long time to finish my routine. They often hold challenges such as the 90-day challenge, which I can't recommend, as it seems to be more about them making money on nutrition counseling and pushing personal training. Though they can be salesy, it's nothing like LA Fitness, where you are treated with total disrespect and find yourself amongst pure heathens. Life Time is a solid gym, slightly on the higher end price wise, but well worth the 15 minute drive for me.

The customer service here was awesome. Everyone was super nice and the interior space was huge, so you won't feel smothered. This was my first time trying this place and my lady and I called in some carry out. Be aware they won't let you apply the check in offer to carry out (to be expected). The food was mediocre at best. The naan was burned and the the chicken tikka masala tasted like it had a Ragu sauce. We had the lamb korma and it was just okay. The worst dish we ordered was the tandoori wings which are my absolute favorite. They were tasteless and bland. Nothing more than just plain chicken wings. Even the Rita didn't quite taste right. Overall I was pretty disappointed.

I discovered this restaurant in another life and it has been a part of me ever since. I used to live in Scottsdale and I would come at least once every week. The food is unreal - truly. I've tried nearly every Indian restaurant in the valley and while others may be good, they just don't compare, so I drive from Chandler to get my fix.   My favorites: -Tandoori chicken wings -Chicken Makhani -Lamb Korma -Garlic Naan  Do yourself a favor and don't settle for less. Come to Tandoori times. Nom nom.

Location no longer exists! I wasted time driving over here based on reviews written Five months ago. The parking lot was deserted and post apocalyptic, with garbage blowing in the wind. There were hooligans in the parking lot shooting dirty looks at my sweet whip. What can I say? Haters want to be me, hoes glad to see me.

Man, I've really gotta say that Papa Johns has gone downhill. My once favorite pizza place has hit rock bottom. Ordered a couple of pizzas the other day only to get home and find that my pizza hardly had any sauce and barely any cheese. It was basically bread pizza. What a pathetic excuse for pizza. Sad times.   Won't return.

Almost paid too much by going to fast fix jewelry and watch repair. Luckily, I saw two friendly sales associates standing near the entrance of this business and thought, "What the heck? I might as well ask their price to put in a couple links and a battery before I spend the $60 the other place quotes me to do both". Sure enough they were way cheaper. I mean $10 for the links added, as opposed to $20 at the other place, and only $17 for the battery as opposed to $40. Come here. End of story. Unless you want to pay more.   Oh and P.S, ask for Michael, he's the man.

I love this place! I've taken my girlfriend here before. But last night was a really special event - her birthday. I decided to get us a private booth this time, which has a $120 minimum spend, but most likely you'll end up doing that anyway. We starting out with the nosh board which was an assortment of meats, dates, and cheeses. She had the chicken, I had the sirloin steak and we both got the mashed potatoes. The chicken was savory and practically melts in your mouth. As for the steak, I've had a ton of steaks in my life but this was by far the best, I mean, it was so tender that I was literally able to cut the steak with a fork! The green chili mashed potatoes were off the hook, great flavor and a huge portion.   The service here is amazing. Our waitress was super friendly, and what I liked best is that she never over talked and almost floated in every time she stopped by to refill our champagne. Quickly in and then back out, so we never broke our conversation. After dinner we went to the patio and enjoyed a view of the city with the comfort of some heaters and even a fireplace.   I will be sure to revisit this place for any special occasion!!

I found these guys using Thumbtack and I've had the worst experience imaginable. Before being contacted by them I had utilized 2 other companies who did a great job the first time, then did about half the work and collected their pay on future visits. Needless to say, I was very nervous hiring a new company having been burned by laziness and dishonesty in the past. JC was the one who came to my property for my initial quote, and he promised me the company was very professional and would take care of all of my trees, palms, bushes, and weeds. However, when I came back into town after agreeing to have them come out I noticed that they had cleaned up my weeds and leaves, and trimmed my bushes in front, but did no work to any of my other trees, any of my palms, and various other plants on my property. I have a total of about 15 various plants and trees and they took care of 1 thing!   In my frustration I reached out to Roman Galas to resolve the problem. Roman assured me that they would send a crew out to trim everything that was missed. The crew came out and trimmed two more trees and left my property without taking care of any of my palms or other plants that were promised to have been taken care of in the initial clean up. 2 times a crew came to my property (unsupervised) and they still couldn't do an entire job! How dishonest!  Now they are trying to charge me for an initial cleanup and for a maintenance visit! Unreal! I told you that continuing to work with you was contingent on you FIXING THE PROBLEM. Instead, you send a crew out and STILL DON'T complete a full job and then try to charge me for it.   I also requested a call from the owner and have received 0 correspondence. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.

What can I say about ATL wings? These guys are the shit. They know how to do wings right. My only grievance is that every time you order for pickup they'll tell you that the wings will be ready in 10 minutes and every time, and I mean every single time, you'll get there and notify them you're here to pickup your order and then they'll drop the wings. I can't complain cause the wings are always fresh, but it is kind of annoying because you have to wait an extra 15 minutes or so unnecessarily.

What more can be said about a local legend? When I think of Shaving Grace I think of the hilarious banter between barbers and clients, I think of consistently perfect haircuts, and I think of how nice it is to not have to constantly be looking for someone who knows how to get it right.   I found Boris a couple of years ago through a friend and then verified their awesome reputation on Yelp. I had probably gone through about 4 different hairstylists before coming in because I could never get the same consistent quality in a haircut. Needless to say, the first time I stepped foot into the barbershop was the last time I stepped into a new one.   If you're looking for a barbershop in the Scottsdale area, come to Shaving Grace. Hell, I moved to Chandler and I still drive to see Boris - he's worth it. He'll remember exactly how you like it done, and if you're ever unhappy he will do whatever it takes to make sure you're 100% in love with your cut. By the way, same goes for any barber on his staff, they all rock.

How disappointing. 20 minutes of sitting at stable and not a single soul ever came by to take our  order. The only reason we were able to even try some of the beer from this place was because we walked up to the bar before the hostess found us a seat.  When we got up to leave, the hostess told us to have a nice night.. How do you not realize a table that you sat hasn't been attended to? Especially when your hostess stand is literally right next to where I'm sitting.  My final beef with this place is the clientele. Nasty hipsters and people who look like they haven't showered for weeks.

Came in here after a long night of drinking one morning and I was extremely impressed. The wait is a little long, but there is an upfront disclaimer that reads "Please be prepared to wait as everything is prepared fresh", yeah I'm down with that. I got the steak quesadillas and a sausage, egg, and cheese burrito. The steak was marinated with lime and was so delicious I could have eaten three more. As for the burrito, it's rare that a place can throw potatoes in and have them be light and fluffy, but these guys pulled it off.   Were it not so far from my house I'd be in more often, but maybe that's a good thing for my waist line. If you're in the area give it a try!   Ps, it's kind of tucked away in the back of a little cluster of buildings, which made it hard to find. And the Yelp pin drop may be off a bit.

Josh was the man! The employees here are so friendly and all of their recommendations are perfect. The food was great, the atmosphere was classy, overall it was a dream. We had the Big Blue van beer , which was infused with blueberry, but very subtlety. As for the food, we went for the burger and the chopped salad. They have bottomless mimosas for $15, which is a steal!!   Will def return! Great food and drink and amazing customer service!

This location just opened up the street from me. I'm super excited to have one so close now. Best thing is, the wait was maybe about 10 minutes tops. The waiting area was clean and pleasant and the doctor took no time getting back.   Will return next time I'm sick! Hopefully not soon !

The customer service is friendly and the portions are pretty reasonable considering how most chipotles are very light handed. The problem here is the awful smell of some chemical lacker of some sort when you walk in the front door. The aroma is awful and very overwhelming. I reported it to the cashier and he just said he couldn't smell anything (great help). I also get very annoyed about how you order salsa and they'll only fill the cups halfway. HELLO, two half cups of salsa costs you more in product cost than a full cup of salsa.
