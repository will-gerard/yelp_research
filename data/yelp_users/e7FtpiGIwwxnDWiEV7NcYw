This forever 21 he a wide variety of clothes but their employees suck. Every time I go there they are rude, and not helpful at all.

Great food, service is pretty fast! My family loves going here because of the outdoor patio. There are both indoor seating and outdoor with shade or in the sun! I love the sauce dispensers, where you can get your own ranch, mustard, ketchup ect! Also be sure to check out the bathrooms they're hilarious!

No matter what time I go there, or what I came there for, there is always the longest line. I'm usually there around 2-3 hours at the least and I pretty much give up my whole day to be there. The employees aren't the nicest and over all I don't have a good experience. I will say this particular mvd was faster than one I went to in Mesa, BUT still very slow.

Acai bowls at thrive are my favorite! Especially the peanut butter one! I love that they have gluten free options too! I love this place. Sometimes service is a little slow but it's worth it
