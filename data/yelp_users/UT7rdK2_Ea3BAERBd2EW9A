This place is so clean. They engage you and talk directly to you and no cross talking. The owner runs a tight ship and you can tell. I really like coming here and always leave satisfied. They do such a good job. A spa pedi is only 22 and its amazing. Go here!

This place is not very clean at all. And instead of talking to you they talk to each other the whole time. I had flies buzzing around and landing on me. Just a bad feel all together. I expected more for the area . I should have gone to my regular place or Nails 101 right down the road. They don't accept tips in debit or credit card form which is weird. I had an unpleasant experience

I love this shop. I learned to play the guitar here when I was a teen and my brother learned the clarinet/sax. The owner Monty, is the most knowledgeable and helpful person you could deal with in town. For over 15 years I have not once been disappointed or let down by this little Gem. I fully intend to bring my soon to be five year old here for guitar and piano. You want to support a hardworking high quality yet competitively priced local business? GO HERE! :)

Excellent and authentic. This is he best sushi in town. I have tried many places and none have topped it. You walk in and the setting is softly lit with perfect modern music playing. Its very hip and a perfect date spot. The food is so fresh. They have the best eel here. Its deliciously crisp and never too fatty. Go here !

This little place is right around the corner to my office. I previously had been here one other time and ordered a breakfast sandwich with a bagel instead of a croissant. It was good and I paid like $5.50. This morning I called ahead and when I went in to pick up the order the woman who was up front was rude to me. I was taken back by this because the previous visit was pleasant and it was with a younger lady. This time I had ordered the sandwich with avocado on the side. The total came to $8.00. Which is nonsense. I left thinking that I'd better have a whole darn avocado for the $3 extra I spent. When I arrived at work and opened up my box I found 4 small slices and a burnt bagel. I felt like I should let them know about my experience today because it really bummed me out. I normally don't complain but this was an exception. I called and spoke to the lady who sold me the sandwich and told her that I needed to make a complaint, that the bagel was burned and she began yelling at me! Lol! Telling me I was lying to her and that I can bring the sandwich back and she'd give me all my money back. I'm seriously blown away by how rude, over priced and unkind this establishment is. Please don't go here.
