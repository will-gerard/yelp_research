If you are looking for a good Mexican restaurant, this is the place to go!  El Charro has been at this location for many years. My husband used to go there as kid and he's in his 30s. I'm not even a huge fan of Mexican food but I do get a craving once in a while and El Charro is one of two places I like to go.  The price is right and food is even better. Everything I've had is delicious and their guacamole is one of the best. Lots of flavor and generous portions too. Their tamales is definitely one of the best ones.  The service can be really crappy. Their dining room and bar is completely separated by a door. The regular waitress in the bar is fantastic and never had a problem with her. The dining room however has been a disappointment many times. They're slow and don't like to come by very often. Last time we were there, we waited 20 minutes for a refill and container but never got them. We had to go ask someone for a container and just left. But it seems pretty consistent that we end up waiting a long time for any service once food is out.  They do close every summer for couple of months so be sure they're open if you go July-September.

This place has been in the same location for 24 years with original owners. That tells you something, doesn't it? It is a hole in the wall but more often than not, its those places that has the best food. Not to mention amazing price.  You will most likely be greeted and served by a middle age woman - she's the owner. She is great! She'll remember you even after one visit. As you eat and watch people come and go, you realize she remembers most of them, even snowbirds. A tasty restaurant that makes you feel welcome? Yes, please!  The buffet is fantastic. It has limited selection but when it's that tasty, it really doesn't matter. They cook everything in small batches so the food is always fresh. They never skimp on any ingredients so you get lots of veggies and meat. The egg rolls - oh my. I'm not a huge fan of most egg rolls as they tend to be greasy and flavorless but they have one of the best egg rolls in town. They make their own dough and it is never dripping with grease. The filling is seasoned and tasty on its own.   We only had a couple of things off the menu that isn't part of the buffet and while the veggie egg foo yung was great, I wasn't too fond of the lemon chicken.   The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because couple of times I went, I had to swap out of silverware for a cleaner one. But this is definitely in my top 3 choices for Chinese food. (at least Americanized Chinese)

I will never return to Tao Yuan ever again, which is a HUGE disappointment. I've returned many times with family and friends and their food was always delicious and consistent. However, my last visit couple of weeks ago has me warning others.  My husband and I went for a late lunch and it was the only thing we ate that day. By 2 a.m., I was hugging the porcelain throne and my husband was in the other bathroom, miserable himself. We were both hit with food poisoning and suffered for days. Since it was the only thing we ate, there is no doubt it was the food from Tao Yuan.   This was the first time we both had food poisoning and can't say it was fun. Since all our other experience was great and the owners are fantastic, I can't rate one star but after that experience, there is no way we will be returning.

I love Arizona's beer culture. AZ has numerous amazing craft breweries and Papago is on top of the list for me.   They're probably best known for their orange blossom. It's a delicious vanilla orange wheat beer that just hits the spot. It's so smooth and full of flavor. Their coconut joe has a hint of coconut with strong coffee flavor. They used to have another stout that was Irish cream base and I'm very sad to report they no longer offer it.  They offer a good variety of draft beers from other craft breweries (local and non) and they have multiple fridges stocked with cold, delicious beer you can purchase and drink right there.   Inside is spacious and has lots of table options. Service can be slow but only during peak time and even then, you won't go long without another cold one in your hand.  The food is actually delicious. I am a huge fan of their caprese flat bread. The balsamic reduction is so good! Their pizzas are a good size for the price and always consistent in quality and taste.   They now have the steel growlers, along with their glass, so be sure to pick one up too. The steel growler is the coolest steel ones I've seen so far in local breweries.

This is a great place for oyster craving and beer. They're open late which is a huge plus for me. It's near campus so the crowd is younger. It has a good atmosphere and it's cozy enough for a date night.  The food is good. Oysters are fresh, great clam chowder and other items on menu I've tried are tasty. The price for oysters are fantastic as well. I could easily eat a dozen and be happy.   Another huge plus: Right around the corner from Cartel!

Best salsa ever. It's blended beautifully with a nice prominent cilantro flavor. Seriously couldn't get enough. They need to jar it and sell it.  I had the carne asada fry bread. Price is great and it was very tasty. The carne asada itself had a good flavor and the fry bread was delicious. It's a good size and piled on with beans, meat, lettuce and tomatoes and also came with side of sour cream and avocado. I couldn't eat the whole thing and took 2/3 of it home where my husband promptly ate the leftovers and he liked it very much as well.   It's a tiny little hole in the wall and a stand alone building. I can see parking being a big problem if there's more than 5 people there. It's truly a family restaurant that's been handed down from one generation to the next. Very friendly and great service as well.

For a shop that was featured on Cupcake Wars, how disappointing. Then again, have you watched Food Network lately? Being on the show does not guarantee good food. Lesson learned, again.   I got the peach berry cupcake and rosewater cupcake, both flavors being featured on Cupcake Wars (or something like that).   Rosewater cupcake - the scent of rose and floral taste was prominent in the frosting. The cake was overly moist to a point you couldn't hold it. It literally just crumbled in your hand. Not good. I like my cake moist but I would also like to actually hold it and be able to take a bite. My hands were a mess. The frosting was too sweet, perhaps too much sugar to make up for the insane amount of rose water put in it. I could smell the roses from 2 feet away.   The peach berry cupcake had peach corn cake with berry compote and tarragon. The tarragon was nowhere to be tasted. It just did not exist. Their website said it came with shortbread on top, which mine didn't have, and maybe the shortbread had tarragon? Either way, my soul was a little crushed due to lack of tarragon. The cake definitely had the corn cake texture and it made the cake a little dry. What an opposite from the rosewater cupcake. The frosting was well done, not overly sweet but not much flavor. Tasted like they went a little overboard with the shortening.   It was an experience but not one I would repeat.

I went to Jason when he used to own the shop across the street. My very colorful tattoo is now 8 years old but still looks new and very vibrant. He's not the best artist in the world but he's good and even better tattoo artist.   My husband actually got a few tattoos from Jason as well, all colorful, and it's still vibrant. Some tattoo artists have no idea what they're doing and your tattoo can fade after a year or even less. Jason touched up the husband's tattoo that was done not quite right by a shop in Scottsdale for free.  My friend was visiting from AL earlier this year so of course I took her to Jason. The only day she was available was one of his days off so we had Brandon tattoo her. She changed her mind couple of times of what to get but he didn't mind at all. She's very happy with her tattoo and it still looks fantastic as of couple of weeks ago.  I'm not sure if there's a room in the back or not if you have to undress for a tattoo but in the front is a little waiting room where you can browse through their portfolios and through the door is a big room with 3 chairs for your tattooing pleasure. It was very clean and kept up to date. They let me stick around in an empty chair while my friend was getting hers done and Brian actually kept me company. He even offered to hold my very pink purse while I got a tattoo haha.   They only take cash so be sure to have yours ready (don't forget to tip!). All 3 has great portfolios so be sure to stop in and take a look.

Kabuki isn't a place I go for sushi often. I have my favorite places for sushi but I was at Tempe market place and it seemed like a good idea at the time.  The food itself is okay. It isn't great but it isn't horrible. It's the same quality as other chain Japanese restaurants. I had spicy miso ramen, which lacked in spiciness but had a good flavor. It lacked in substance though. They could really dress up the ramen other than few strands of seaweed, little bit of sweet corn tossed in and handful of bean sprouts.   The rolls were okay. Spicy albacore left a lot of spicy to be desired, salmon was fatty and good, just lacked a lot of flavor. The eel was tough and overcooked, not to mention there were still bones so I had to be careful with it.   Service was good. The waitress was fast and very polite. Definitely good service.  I sat at the sushi bar with my boyfriend and let's talk about the sushi chefs. There were 3 working while I was there, Oscar, Sam and Josh. Oscan was hispanic and Sam and Josh were Korean (I promise this will matter in just a minute). I was so offended and disgusted with Josh's behavior. I'm Korean myself and speak the language fluently. I guess Josh assumed I didn't because he and Sam were speaking in Korean and Josh REPEATEDLY cursed and called Sam a derogatory name. Oscar of course did not speak Korean and when he said something to Josh (nothing bad, just about the food), Josh called him another derogatory name in Korean. I could tell from their interaction Oscar was used to Josh saying something to him in Korean and not knowing what it was. Josh just kept talking like that to his coworkers, even going into his dislike for the current job. I came to enjoy a nice lunch. Did I have to sit there and listen to this? I don't care if you think I don't speak Korean. The fact that the chef can stand there in front of customers and belittle his coworkers and talk like that is completely disrespectful. Not to mention there was another couple at the sushi bar and he talked about them as well.   An employee was refilling my drink and he was not dressed like the wait staff so I asked if he was the manager and he said he was. I told him I didn't appreciate having to eat my lunch in an environment where the chef is cursing throughout my lunch and he said he will talk to them. He didn't even ask me which chef it was and instead, right in front of me, asked to see Sam. Sam went behind the curtain with the manager and within seconds, Josh followed Sam. They all came back less than a minute later and that was it. Sam and Josh was smiling and laughing when they came back to behind the bar.  This was truly an absurd lunch. I will personally never return to Kabuki but if you do go, be sure to sit in the dining room, not the sushi bar, especially if you speak Korean!

I've been going to Mido for years. Not sure why it took me so long to write this review but better late than never!  I've tried more sushi places than I care to count and Mido is by far the best. They have the best fish in town. Their all you can eat for 20 bucks is very attractive as well. I did find Sunday dinners are the freshest.  I always do the all you can eat because I get the sashimi plate. The chefs are great. If you're lucky enough to know the owner (like me!), you'll get all sorts of perks. Sashimi, items not on the menu, experimental items, it's a great perk.   The rolls are delicious, sushi is fresh and food ample. Restaurant is clean and servers can be slow when its busy but they are attentive. They used to have high turnover but for the last year or so, they've had consistent staff so good on them!  All meals come with edamame, sesame salad and miso soup. If you do all you can eat, they give you ice cream for dessert as well.

Tried this place on a whim. I wasn't sorry I did.  The service is okay. It's the family operating it and they take your order at the counter and bring the food to you. You get drinks refill but they keep it behind the counter so you have to bug them everytime.   I got the red chili beef and honey and sugar fry breads. The red chili beef was good, I liked the flavors but it was very greasy. It's a good size and my boyfriend and I shared one. The fry bread is flaky and has a good flavor on its own. The honey and sugar was delicious too. They're generous with their portions. I shared the dessert as well and we both walked out stuffed.   It's a good place around the corner for a quick fry bread fix but if I'm really craving it, I think I'll head to another place.

Another establishment I visited after reading the amazing reviews and it did not disappoint.   Interior is small but clean and there was only a group of 6 that was there when I arrived so it wasn't busy. The group was placing their order before mine but despite the large order ahead of mine, service was quick and prompt.   I got my order to go to share and ordered the red chili meat, beans & cheese deluxe style and powdered sugar and honey fry bread for dessert. They are very generous with their portion. I ate half of my fry bread and was so full. The dessert fry bread was delicious and very large.   The fry bread itself had a decent flavor and it is fluffy and delicious. The overall flavor was a great mix, nothing too overpowering and a great mix of ingredients. The only thing was I wish the red chili meat had more flavor on its own. It's very subtle and couldn't really taste the red chili too much.   I'm definitely going back to try the philly cheese steak fry bread!

Candies! Who's not rating them a 5??   Its a family owned giant candy store filled with any kind of candy you could ask for, including some old school classics.  You go in thinking you'll spend $10 at most but walk out with a least double that. My goodness.. I'm looking at jelly belly and chupa chops from my latest visit right now.   This is not a store to go to for your average everyday candy like Snickers, Twix, etc. This is a SPECIALTY store. If you want a Snickers bar, go to Circle K. Go to sweeties for the ones you won't find there.  Now go away while I munch on buttered popcorn jelly belly, =)

What a fantastic place! I've been going to that location since it was Lazy Q's pool hall but haven't been back in a long time. I'm sure glad I went!   We went on a Saturday night at 8 p.m., what is usually one of the busiest hours for any establishment. Despite the hour, we were given a table immediately and our waitress came by many times that we lacked any need. I think she might have been flirting with my friend too haha.  The place is split into 2 sections - the large room with endless tables and another smaller room designated for smoking. I have no idea how they got through the loophole with the smoking ban but I'm sure smokers appreciate it. I was in the non smoking room but I didn't smell any smoke emanating from the other room. There are hourly and quarter tables and prices weren't too bad either. For the busy time we went, we paid $10/hour. Weekdays are cheaper of course. Tables are very clean and we didn't have any problem with ours. Sometimes you can get a table that leans or is bumpy but not here. The cues were all decent too. On our first try we got a balanced cue with good weight. They had couple different weight cues.   Now the ever important bar - what is it about pool halls and alcohol that makes them so great together? They have a great bar selection. They had around a dozen beers on tap and a good selection of bottles as well. They had drink specials, which is rare for a Saturday night, and we definitely took advantage of that. For Saturday, only thing I can tell you is that from 7 p.m. - 9 p.m., it was $3 off pitchers and from 7 p.m. to closing, they had $2 kamikazes. We had a few kamikazes, 2 pitchers and a bottle and the total was around $30. Sorry, I can't give you definite price as I didn't look at the itemized receipt. But for all that, it wasn't bad at all. And it wasn't just all American ale on tap either. We had Blue Moon and O'dell's cutthroat porter but they definitely had a good variety, including couple from San Tan brewery.   Another plus for the place - Groupon! I was able to find a Groupon Now! deal for them, a $10 for $20 deal. My husband couldn't find it for some reason but I found it on my phone and was able to use it that night without any problem.   Being a pool hall, I was a bit concerned that maybe it would be too loud but not at all. Even on a busy night, I had no problem conversing with the boys and we didn't have to scream in each other's faces. Huge plus there. I hate when they have to shout and spit in your face. =)  All in all, I'll definitely be back. My husband needs to work on his game a bit more haha.

This is the 3rd worst cupcake store I've ever been to and trust me, I've been to my fair share of them.   The staff was okay. They weren't very knowledgeable but they were friendly enough. Not very personable, just a quick hello and thanks were exchanged.   The cupcakes are just over $4 with tax for standard size. At least in other places, it's for the large cupcakes but for a good cupcake, I don't mind paying the price. Except here. Is it too late to get my money back??  I got the salted caramel and I'm thoroughly disappointed. I've spent my life with pastries and this was a huge let down for the reputation they have. The frosting was the worst. It tasted and felt like nothing but shortening. It's supposed to be buttercream, not shorteningcream. There was no real flavor to it either. I understand using shortening in moderation with butter but this was all shortening. The only flavor I got out of it was from the drizzled salted caramel on top. The cake was okay at best. They had little tiny bits of random salted caramel in the cake that provided the flavor but otherwise, it was a plain cake. Nothing special. I expected the whole cake to have a caramel taste to it too.  I should probably try another one but after that, I'm not expecting any other frosting to be better. I think I'll save my money and try another place. There are plenty of others, that's for sure!

What a waste of gas and money.   I made the drive from Mesa and I was utterly disappointed. The shop is small, hot and not up to my standard of cleanliness. But I was there and I had to try them.   We order the mango mousse and pistachio macaron. The mango mousse is layered between cake and has mango gelee on top. The cake was flavorless and dry, the mousse lacked flavor and could barely tell it was supposed to taste like mango and it was dry. How do you get dry mousse??? Ask Eorupean Bakery, they should be able to tell you. Mango mousse? Mango not.  The macaron was a disaster. It was over baked and the shell was nothing but a giant air bubble, being hollow inside. The filling wasn't spread out and only had some in the middle. My biggest issue with the pistachio macaron was that it was not pistachio! It you're going to make a pistachio macaron, you are supposed to use pistachio meal, not almond meal like traditional macaron. You can't use 90% almond and 10% pistachio and tint it green and call is pistachio. No, just no. How do you sell macaron so sub par to your customers?   While "enjoying" our sweets, we observed the staff with couple of other customers and their cake orders. The cake looked good on the outside but what is it with their packaging?? If someone orders a large sheet cake, can you provide a little more than just a flimy box bottom? Use a cardboard and a real box that's actually big enough for the cake please. The service was slow and their napkin holders were out of napkins and I brought it to their attention but they never refilled it.

The famous Churn ice cream. They are attached to Windsor restaurant and a fun establishment. They have old time toys and candies to browse through while you wait for your ice cream.  We went right after they opened so we had to wait about 15 minutes for them to put out all the ice cream but the employee engaged us and looking through the toys killed the time.   I had the pineapple sorbet in a cake cone and my boyfriend had the Vietnamese coffee. The Vietnamese coffee was very sweet and uses real coffee ground. Delicious! It was perfectly creamy and just like drinking a cup of Vietnamese coffee. The pineapple sorbet was very refreshing and crumbly. Delicious.  The reason I took a star away was lack of preparation before opening and the only bad thing: stale cone. My cake cone was so stale that I took 2 bites of it and threw it away. Yuck! Being socked in the sorbet didn't help at all.   I'll be back but next time, I'll just get it in the cup.

When it comes to little restaurants owned by hard working people trying to make it in this economy, Esther and Martial seems to understand just what it takes to be successful. They've got it all: good food, good service, clean environment and good dessert. (Dessert is a whole separate food group in my opinion!)  Let's talk about the place and people first. It's what I'd call a hole in the wall. It occupies a space at the end of a small strip mall. It has a little designated outside area with few tables and inside isn't too terribly big either. But it's nicely decorated without going crazy and makes you feel cozy. It's clean and they keep it up. When I went, it was only the owners there, Esther and Martial, tending to their customers. They have a good rhythm together and they're both very sweet and friendly. They make you feel very welcome. They patiently teach you how to eat something I've never even heard of and explained the menu items and some options. They even taught me different styles of African cuisine. I could tell they were happy to do what they did and glad to share part of their world with a newbie.   And the star of the show: the food. Oh my gosh. Delicious. I tried 3 dishes. The egusi, fried tilapia and yassa. All three were delicious. Egusi, also known as fu fu, is made with goat meat and served with pounded yam. They help you wash your hands and you take the dough (yam), shape it, dip it in egusi and eat it. Very different. Egusi had a great, strong flavor and wasn't overpowering. I couldn't get used to the texture of the pounded yam but it did have a good flavor. It melts in your mouth. Fried tilapia is a whole tilapia! It's served with the entire fish, head and tail included. You'll see its eyes and little teeth. It's served with jolof rice and some sort of cucumber relish side that complimented the fish very well. Yassa is served on a bed of rice and red beans. It reminded me of curry quite a bit. Even the beans had a lot of flavor on their own, which is hard to accomplish. Everything was delicious and smelled as good as it tasted.  There's a reason they were named the best donut of 2012 by New Times. I don't care how full you are. You must order their pof pof and try it while it's still warm. Oh my delicious. They were soft, doughy, sweet but not overly so. It looks like plain cake donut but much, much yummier. I got 2 orders of it to go to share with people so I can convince them to try this place.  Oh and Martial was my bartender. I had their fela fruity and ginger mint. He definitely does not skimp on the booze and they're tasty. The fela fruity is a mix of fruity alcohol and mixers. Very tropical. Ginger mint. Oh boy. Martial asked what kind of alcohol I wanted and I knew spiced rum would go perfectly and boy, was I right. The spiced rum was the perfect compliment to ginger mint. They make their ginger mint juice from scratch with fresh ingredients. The rum helped with the ginger kick and it was absolutely delicious. They offer their mixed drinks in virgin form so you don't have to worry about getting drunk. I would suggest watering down the ginger mint a little bit. It's a strong drink.  Is it obvious I loved this place? It should be. If not, go up and read my review again. No wait, better idea. Put some clothes on, grab some friends and just go to Fu Fu. You won't regret it. Can't wait to go back!

My husband and I have our favorite Italian place but decided to give Christina's a try. What a mistake that was. Since I had suggested we try there, I felt terrible and apologized to the hubby. Yes, it's that bad.  Upon reading the menu on their website, it looked promising. We already had a few things in mind we'd like to try. This place is a hole in the wall. It looks like an old building someone just moved into. Not a problem, some of the best food I've ever had was in hole in the walls. Inside was clean with outdated everything. The tables are possibly the cheapest things they could find and cloth chairs. Uncomfortable but okay, I can deal with that.   We were seated within minutes upon arrival and noticed only Michelle was waiting tables. There were 2 other tables but they left as soon as we got there. From the time we ordered our drinks to the time we got our check, we were the only table. It took her more than 5 minutes to come get our order so she was slow but that's okay, no big deal.   We ordered fried ravioli to start, he had the stuffed haddock and I had the chicken primavera. Let's talk about drinks. Happy hour beer price is great, alcohol price is comparable to any other restaurants. I had water which tasted like it came straight out of a tap and hubby got a soda, which Michelle kept forgetting what kind it was despite the fact that we were the only one there. I felt the food was a bit pricy for the restaurant but if its good, I wouldn't have cared.   My meal came with a garden salad. They call THAT a salad? It was ice berg lettuce, 3 strips of bitter green peppers and 2 chunks of tomatoes. I got it with their homemade ranch which was really runny and warm. I never use a lot of dressing but I had to pour the entire little cup just to get some flavor with my lettuce. I only ate half of it as the bottom was swimming in ranch of course but still no flavor.   The ravioli. The homemade pasta was good and used good breading. The inside however, was nothing but ricotta and parsley. It would be okay if they used some spices but nope, just those two. It lacked flavor like the ranch dressing. It came with their marinara sauce for dipping and hubby and I took one bite and that was it. Their red sauce tasted and looked like nothing but can of crushed tomatoes, sugar and little bit of garlic. Red sauce is staple of good Italian eating. Hubby and I ended up talking about what kind of jar sauce we'd rather have. (I make my own so that's saying a lot)  Michelle brought our food and she actually got my order wrong so had to send it back. She checked her notepad and she had written down the right dish but somehow she told the kitchen the wrong one. I'm certain it was her mistake, not the kitchen. (will explain in a bit) His stuffed haddock came with two sides so he got the sausage and sauteed spinach. The sausage was swimming in the red sauce so he had to scrape off as much as he could. It was very tender, great texture but again, lacked any flavor. I tasted meat, that's it. The spinach.. Oh dear goodness... It was swimming in lemon juice and butter and when he took a bite, he made a really bad face. I took a bite while saying, "how bad could spi..." and stopped talking. I've never had such bitter spinach. His haddock.. It was small, thin and swimming in sauce that looked cloudy and had developed a nasty skin on top. He said the crab stuffing was okay but like everything else, just lacked flavor. The haddock itself wasn't fishy which is good but again, no real flavor.   When he got done, I finally got my right dish. The veggies were small and thinly sliced and alternated between okay bite and bitter bite. Judging by the bitterness and how soggy they were, I'm certain they use frozen vegetables, which is NOT okay. The white wine sauce was just butter with splash of wine. It's been nearly 3 hours since I ate and I can still taste the butter.   Small restaurants are better than chains but not this one. It is completely unacceptable to use frozen vegetables, especially for the price they charge. When our meal was over, she brought the check and there was a 20% gratuity added onto it!! I asked her to take it off as there was no way I was giving her a 20% tip. But I had to go up front to ask her to do that as after she dropped off the check, she didn't come back for 20 minutes.   Oh and how I know she screwed up my order - when we were done, another table came in and one of them ordered a sauvignon blanc but she brought a cabernet. She admitted she heard sauvignon and brought the cabernet. She doesn't pay attention basically.  I feel like we completely wasted our money on this place. I'm all for trying new places but experiences like this makes me want to just stick to my usual Italian place. So, RUN, do not walk, AWAY from Christina's!

Dear Matt's big breakfast. I dreamt of your waffles last night.    Big, unbelievably fluffy, waffles. Delicious waffles. Best waffles. The sweet cream butter and maple syrup makes this amazing waffles out of this world.   The thick cut bacon is perfectly crispy on the edges but chewy too. So good. The hash brown is perfectly crispy without being burnt and tasty. The scrambled eggs were so fluffy. The blueberry jam that came with the toast was not overly sweet and just so full of ripe blueberry. And the freshly squeezed orange juice. I'm salivating just writing this review!  The wait wasn't long. We went around 8:30 a.m. on Saturday morning and waited maybe 10 minutes for a table. Service was fast and great.

I went to Republica Empanada after researching local places. Their fig, mozzarella and dulce de leche empanada caught my eye so I grabbed my partner in crime and went for lunch on a Friday afternoon.  The place is tiny but very clean and nicely decorated. Not ideal with children. Inside it has one long table (bar) with bunch of chairs and about 8-10 small tables with 2-4 chairs each. They do have an outside seating area but I didn't go out. The place was rated A by health department as well.   I went just before noon and it was already busy. By the time 12:30 hit, it was packed. But they are very fast and lines moved quickly. The food didn't take long to come out and in the meantime, you get the enjoy the delicious smell.   We got 6 empanadas total. 4 meal and 2 sweet. We had the buffalo chicken, mushroom chicken, pernil, boricua, Ruiz's pieces and fig cheese & caramel. The savory ones were filled and generous. The pernil was tender and flavorful. The boricua is pernil with rice, peas, etc. and it had a tiny bit of spice and even better than the pernil. The buffalo chicken wasn't overpowering buffalo flavor and mushroom chicken was savory and moist with good spices.Ruiz's pieces was nutella and peanut butter. It was generously sprinkled with powder sugar and inside was warm and gooey. The star of the show for me was fig cheese and caramel. Dried fig with melted mozzarella and dulce de leche. What an interesting combination of flavors but it worked wonderfully together. It also came generously sprinkled with powder sugar.   It's a great local hole in the wall. We both loved everything about the place but the food is definitely worth the trip. It's a bit hidden but look for a red sign, it's hard to miss from the corner. Definitely a great find!

I've already written a not so flattering review for the Tempe location and now, I'm sad to write an even worse review.  I've never been more disappointed with a macaron in my life. But we'll get back to that.  Inside is bright and clean with friendly employees. The parking is a nightmare. The back has a small lot with about dozen spots. An employee was standing outside "working" the traffic for the lot but he just stood there against the building. Unbelievable. I had to look for myself to see if there was a spot as when I asked, he said to go check. Okay, thanks for doing your job.  Order process was fast and simple. End of that.   The brioche. What the heck happened to their brioche loaf? In Tempe location, it was fluffy and light and delicious but in Phoenix location, it was at least a day old, too eggy and dry. Their brioche was the best thing but wow. I hope the Tempe location hasn't change.  The macaron. Seriously?! The shell - too many air bubbles, cracked, uneven, hollow and spread too much. The filling - too runny and curdled. The filling is only in the center instead of spread out entirely. Majority of the flavor is supposed to come from the filling that soaks into the shell but when the filling is only in the center, the flavor can't spread. You get the filling in the middle but the rest of the macaron is just eating the shell. As a pastry chef, those are the shells that would have never seen the light of day. It is an insult to be served those inadequate macarons, let alone pay for it. Who cares if its big? It's just more flavorless shell to eat. I would rather have macarons from AJ's fine foods. I saw worse macarons in the case so I hope they never sell those to their customers.   Absolute and utter disappointment.
