Flat, old tasting soda. Burned cheese crisp. Watery salsa. Congealed re fried beans. Hair in rice. Peeling paint on walls. Half assed service. No Cholula sauce.  Pass. Do not enter. I should have read the reviews first, but thought the outside looked retro and fun. That's Yelp karma...

This location has gone above and beyond in customer service for me. Employees are phenomenal.  Clean store, ample parking, great sale prices and a huge selection - and whatever you can't get on site you can order online and have shipped to your home address or pick up in store.  Truly superior management - stop by if you're in the neighborhood.

Most unremarkable below average place I could imagine.  80's decor, flat soda, bland food (burger, chicken tenders, Chaparral sandwich), slightly high (but not preposterously so) prices, blah service. Really just quite a depressing sort of one notch above Denny's establishment.  Two stars are for the friendly and personable manager who was the only bright spot in the joint. Hope he finds a better gig soon.

Nice, clean, well stocked.  Not enough cashiers working, lines way too long.  Friendly employees, great produce, awesome bath and body selection.  Parking lot way too dark. Very uncomfortable.  I'll stick with Camelback and Miller.

I've never reviewed a store before, but I had such a nice customer service experience the other day I have to. This store always has an amzing sale going on - I would never pay full price for anything. I bought a few pairs of jeans for my daughter and when we got them home realized the gigantic security tag was still on one of the pair. I returned to Kohls a few days later to have it removed and the lady working the register gave me an extra 20% my new purchases for my trouble...who still does things like that? They actually appreciate and value their customers. I think thats fantastic. Kohls cash is great, also. Store has always been clean and orderly when I go in - lines move quickly.  No 5th star because returns are only accepted in the back recesses of the store.

Consistently good food - but I consistently order the petite chicken Caesar salad. Always comes with two huge hunks of bread that I vow not to finish and always do. I think the chicken they use in their salad is amazing - perfectly seasoned, thin and tender.  I hate the prices ( $10 for my salad and a small iced tea,) and the noise level/seating area is insanity during peak lunch hours. Employees are friendly and service is fairly quick, especially considering the crowds they have to contend with.

I want to be able to leave 5 stars, but watching the melee that occurs every day at lunch, you wonder why this store isn't better prepared to deal with the volume they get daily. While waiting almost TWENTY minutes to get my to go order, I witnessed  up to 19 plates waiting to be delivered at once, multiple to go orders double boxed because tickets weren't pulled and a line of customers grow to 13 while the only two available cashiers had to take phone orders and help others in the bakery.  Good for Wildflower for having an excellent product, but it really is time to step up the ratio of staff and maybe get some more organizational procedures in place.  I won't be back until you do. My lunch break isn't long enough...

Clean, great location, well organized, amazing array of phenomenal soaps that I find myself addicted to. Great bakery and sushi selection.  Produce and deli are fantastic and well stocked.  Compared to the north Scottsdale store - this one is a lot more laid back and small, not nearly as overwhelming or fun to visit, but a lot better than your neighborhood Frys.

Perfect flight, competent and caring staff, smooth take offs , landings and flights. My carry on was too large for the overhead and quickly valeted for me. It's a budget airline and they get you from point A to point B.  I have to laugh at a lot of the reviews where people didn't make their connecting flights. Book flights accordingly and allow for incidentals. Why is this a surprise to people?  Also, if the door is closed, please stop complaining they didn't let you board. Those are the rules and they are there for everyone's safety. Just because you're traveling with 4 kids and couldn't make it to the gate on time shouldn't be everyone else's problem. ALSO - the $25 checked baggage fee is all over the airlines website and check in desk. Please don't act insulted during your whiny yelp review and complain. Do 5 minutes of research before you book your flight and maybe you won't be so caught off guard by the information that is readily available to you. That is all.

Best green corn tamales around. Great for takeout - small indoor and patio seating for dining in. Super casual ambiance, fantastic lunch specials, extremely good food and beyond reasonable prices. Fresh hot chips are always included with your order and beer/margaritas are available here as well. I understand they do a large amount of catering and have always wowed customers with exceptional service. This location had been in the heart of Old Town for as long as I can recall and I've never been disappointed. A must for anyone in the area.

Funny thing. When you peruse all of Yelps "non recommended" reviews for this place - most of them are pretty bad, and all say the same thing.  Lousy service (check) In attentive /rude/uncaring staff (check again) Dirty menus and establishment (ewwww) Sub par ice cream and food (yup) A sense of disarray and no organization (saw it) I think the only thing this establishment has going for it it's kitchy pink decor, history in Old Town and the long ago reviews of "the way things used to be"...apparently you can only ride that for so long. This place is just awful now. Too bad. Bill Keene would be disappointed.... Even the owner himself was unfriendly. Shame.

I should have known better. I went anyhow, more for the landmark quality of the place and the quirky architecture than anything else. That is what the two stars represent.   The food was horrid. What happened to the authentic Mexican that use to be served here? Everything was bland, obviously under a heat lamp too long, lacking salt, spice or taste. Apparently anything can go out to a table if 2 lbs of cheese is melted over the top of it. Burned beans, cheese crisp swimming in grease and tacos with a hair baked into the shell.   This place really needs to pull themselves together and make some changes - too many other options these days.

Enjoyable dinner at the Cove. Great pizzas, fantastic salads and superb service. Our server, Anthony, was top notch and went above and beyond in his customer service skills. Ambiance, decor and cleanliness all above average also. Nice place to catch some happy hour deals and the lunch specials they advertise are worth heading back for. I would not recommend the calamari, but have heard the shrimp verde is phenomenal. Will be trying that next.

Both employees we dealt with were friendly and helpful. Nice selection of stuff. Prices were more than fair and we got a discount as well. Shop is in a nice area of South Scottsdale with ample parking. May not be the biggest square footage or selection - but I'd rather have quality over quantity. We'll be back for sure.  Awesome blu ray/ DVD section, game systems, tools and audio visual stuff.

Amazing prices - outstanding customer service. Don't let the little storefront in a sort of ghetto strip mall fool you. Superior quality  on lenses, also. Renee helped me and is fantastic. I came here after being told my buy one get one deal at Visionworks would cost me over $600. Walked out of here with FOUR pairs for less than that. Awesome.

Amazing customer service. Top notch, quality attention to detail. We were lucky enough to get paired with Mike Conway and  I would highly recommend him to anyone. He took the time to explain the steps in detail, was flexible when we needed him to be, and walked me thought the entire car set up even through the lot was closed and it was getting late. Prices were extremely reasonable and the whole process of buying a used car was friendly and pleasant. I'm sure there are going to always be unhappy reviewers who didn't get what they want, but I can honestly and without hesitation recommend Mike and the guys in finance for a painless experience at a dealership. Am now the proud owner of a beautiful 2010 Mazda 3 (manual, please).  Thanks again Mike!

Interesting concept - dining within a market. You order your food at the counter and once you find a table your order is brought out to you. Friendly employees, efficient service, quirky concept, good food, decent prices and wine.  What more could you ask for? My party tasted the meatball sub, cheese ravioli, veggie sub and pizza. All very tasty.  Shopping after eating - it's a win/win. Great location in South Scottsdale with ample parking. I'll be back to try the fettuccine  alfredo. Heard good things about it.

Awesome dog park. Grass and sand areas with tunnels and tires, water fountains and lots of benches provided. There is an "active" and "passive" area  - two separate sides, which really translate to "big" and "little" dog sections. The park is well lit and beautifully maintained - it's a shame more owners don't pick up after their pets with the bags supplied by the park. It really is a mess. Most of the people I see hanging out there spend more time with their iPod than there dog, pretty sad, but  it is a fantastic place to get your furry friend some playtime and exercise. Open til 10:00 at night which is nice also.

I love the Scottsdale library. Solid little used bookstore, serious DVD/Blu ray selection, awesome coffee shop, great teen center (check out their website for lots of free summer activities), fantastic kiddie section and overall general book nerd paradise. The staff is always pleasant and helpful, I love that I can self checkout (do miss the "THUNK" of the old timey due stamp they used to use...) and the views are phenomenal. Covered parking and drive thru return bins are an added bonus.  My only gripe is the petition people that seem to be hovering around the front 2nd floor entrance constantly - just a go and different route to avoid them!  Make sure you bring a cute carrying bag when you visit because you'll definitely need one when you leave.

Warm, scented towels, amazing lower leg and foot massage, hot stone rub, phenomenal callous removal....I almost fell asleep. My toes look fantastic and I'm completely relaxed. What more could you possibly need?  The only thing I didn't care for was the white trash talk show on the tv and the massage chair was difficult to work. Small price to pay for such a great service!

I tried to forgot my experience and bury it - let it go - I can't. I had the worst facial experience of my life here.  1. If you're going to book me with a male aesthetician - ask me first. Make sure the guest is alright with it.  2. Know your product ingredients and benefits at all times. Don't bs your way around my questions. 3. If you're going to use a barber wrap on someone's face - leave an opening for their mouth/nose. It's best not to suffocate guests. 4. Don't leave the room when someone is "masking". I'm paying for your service - not to be left alone for 10 minutes. Some pampering or massage would be nice.  The facility is lovely, the front desk knew I as leaving unhappy and didn't bother to follow up. Poor customer service in my opinion.  There are many better options near by. Do a yelp check and pass this up.

Nice place. Great indoor/outdoor seating. Large menu with lots of sizing options. Customizable burgers or Mac and cheese - lots of salads as well.  We tried a few different things - really good chicken and basic cheeseburger sliders - the pb&j was tasty as well, but the most interesting thing we tried was the "exotic" selection of rabbit. That's right. A bunny burger. Quite tasty. Service was excellent, food came out quickly and refills on drinks were plentiful. One star off for having to order the fries and tots a la carte and the music selection should be a bit more family friendly when it's early and there's lots of kiddos in the place. We will be back for sure!

This Ross is definitely one of the more ghetto stores I've shopped in. Parking sucks, lines are super long and the disarray in the aisles is never ending. Clothes piled on the floor, shoes strewn all over the aisles, toddler Spider-Man pjs mixed with women's knits, hoochie leopard print lingerie next to preteen skater t shirts ...you get the idea.  Good selection of housewares, bedding and knick knacks though. This is also a good Ross to visit if you're bilingual - I rarely hear English here.  Could use a good clean up crew for sure.

Friendly employees, clean and organized store, fantastic selection, great prices, unbeatable customer service, fun jewelry, tasty edibles, awesome beer and wine options... You can't go wrong at this location.  This store is run and managed like a lot of other places should strive to be. Amazing management and employees help this particular World Market stand out.  Always greeted, welcomed and made to feel special here. Kudos to whomever is in charge. Love your Tempe Marketplace team!  Love the membership discounts and specials, also! Be sure and sign up - it's worth it.

Tasty pizza. Really good meatball appetizer. Impressive service. Quick refills. Friendly employees.  Couldn't hear each other talking across the table it was so loud. We actually left to have coffee elsewhere so we didn't have to shout.  If this is just me that's had this experience I will definitely try again - I just can't stand dining in a place where you have to yell at the person across from you. This was on a Wednesday evening around 6:00 - maybe I'll try again on a Mon or Tues or go a bit later when there aren't so many big families or kids - idk. Weird no one else mentions it.

Wandered around for 22 minutes before someone offed to help me - not a busy time of the day, not a lot of customers in the store. At this point I was irritated since I was trying to buy a decent laptop and had a dozen questions.   Six days later returned and this time I wandered for over a half hour and watched employees take selfies, check Facebook, have pow wows, got shoulder checked by one guy and felt like I was interrupting a male bonding session when I needed to go and ask for assistance. Worst customer service imaginable. In this day in age you REALLY need to make sure you're taking care of the consumer - not making them feel bothersome. This store falls way short. There was one decent employee out of the bunch who took care of me after I griped to him. I'll look up his name and do an edit.

I should have read the reviews before choosing this place. Shame on me.  I felt like we were at a day care facility that happened to serve awesome burgers. Crying babies, unruly toddlers, older children literally running down the aisles, inattentive parents and unbelievable amount of NOISE. Unfortunately no matter how tasty and reasonably priced their burgers are, we will never return to this locale.   Not slamming the establishment, just letting others know.

Really fun experience. Took a gourmet cooking class here and we'll probably be back again. Wonderful instructors and staff, amazing food, all you can drink beer, wine or soda. They let everyone participate and there are plenty of professionals on hand to help out. Extremely knowledgable, fun, courteous and helpful.  Beautiful kitchen stations and dining area as well. Dinner is served after you take part in the preparation (dessert also) and there is more than enough to go around.   Highly recommended!

Impeccable. Everything was absolutely phenomenal.  Gorgeous setting - we were lucky enough to be sat in the courtyard and it's breathtaking.  Service was top notch, timing was perfect, management was gracious and the food was utterly amazing. I honestly don't think I've ever had such a pleasurable dining experience.    The menu changes weekly and you can view it online before you make reservations. Its fairly costly, but worth every penny. Best restaurant Scottsdale has to offer in my opinion. Definitely check it out.

Next time I'm 22 years old, sporting a Mesh truckers hat, cliche tattoos and a bikini top I'll jump on here and give expert reviews.  If you want a decent family/couples restaurant and a place to go without hearing the f bomb dropped every few minutes by kids - look elsewhere.  Food was mediocre, prices ok, crowd and atmosphere unappealing.  Apparently the Sasquatch burger is the thing to order. If you are under 25 and don't want to live past 50 this place rocks, if not - do yourself a favor and move along.  That being said service was great and food was tasty - just head over before 7:00 to avoid the DB crowd.

Best burger I've had in Scottsdale. Period. Perfectly juicy, hot, tasty, ooey cheesy goodness with awesome fries - consistently delicious. Where else can you get such an amazing burger (double) for $8 - especially  in Old Town? Cute diner setting, super friendly wait staff, great music and bottomless fries. I always recommend David's when asked where to get a good burger. I have heard delivery is rather slow, but we opt to dine in - there at least once a month - definitely give it a try!

Always clean, bright enough to hurt your retinas and well stocked. This location is always busy and it seems as though the throngs of customers cant follow the designated flow of the Yogurtland path to happiness and a cluster always ensues.  Great selection of ever changing flavors (I'm partial to the tart) and more than ample choices for toppings. Complimentary tasting cups are available as is refreshing, fruit infused water.  Wish there was additional seating, better parking and a dimmer for the lighting.

It's becoming more obvious to me that these reviews fluctuate not as much from each persons experience, but from some peoples attitudes. I think some reviewers enjoy being constantly disgruntled. That being said - beautiful decor, very unique art on display, friendly and attentive staff, quick service, HUGE portions and the food itself was phenomenal. Fried tofu, pad Thai, vegetarian fried rice, cucumber salad and spring rolls were all ordered and absolutely everything was top notch. In the cooler months I would love to dine on the patio - tons of lush greenery - doesn't even look like Arizona. Awesome happy hour specials on drinks and appetizers as well.

Super cute place. I love supporting non corporate places such as this.  Great selection of food, beer, wines, coffee, smoothies, pastries, etc. Free wifi and some eclectic furniture to get comfy on. Nice patio out front, open late and a drive thru to boot. Community board, local art and complimentary reading material as well. Employees are super friendly and service was quick. Prices are a tad on the steep side but other than that I really love this place. Also got a $1 off deal when I did a Yelp check in. Awesome. If you're in the area please stop in and support these guys instead of Starbucks!

I have a new favorite place. I love it here. The ambiance, decor, location - all phenomenal. Great happy hour specials. Bruschetta options are amazing - wine choices are abundant - I love them all. Sangria is excellent - give it a try for sure.  Service is top notch, there is more of a crowd than you would expect mid week and I've seen live music listed for weekends. It's everything a nice Scottsdale wine bar should be without the douchey factor - how can you beat that?  Love the artwork, patio, water presentation and comfy couch area. Meatballs are a must order and there are different dinner specials offered nightly.  I already have a follow up date planned here - and many more to come. Definitely on the new "go to" list.  They have a Yelp deal for checking in as well. What's not to love?

If this review was based solely on the food, I would have given it 4 stars, but the entire experience, unfortunately ruined my view of the place.  Waiter was new - thats fine, I understand that he brought the wrong wine and wasn't sure what my sauces were when I inquired.  My problem is that bringing in a $25 off coupon from restaurant.com cost us an extra 15 minutes waiting for someone to figure out how to apply it, then doing it for the wrong amount, and then fixing it and applying it again.  Four days later and I've still got two charges for the cost of dinner pending on my account.  I called and spoke to a manager who informed me "this is how the payments have to be done with coupons".  So I assume if I had brought cash and owed $35 I would have had to leave $70 and could go pick up half of it after 5 days?  Whatever.  Honestly without the coupon I think $16 - $20 is way too much for a plate of chicken and rice, no matter how tasty.  Shame.

Quite awful. Greasy. Beef and broccoli was 80% broccoli and the pieces were HUGE so they took up most of the room in the bowl. Hardly any sauce at all. Ordered egg fried rice by #, got home and some nasty looking fried rice with cubed meat, jumbo shrimp and huge raw onion chunks were in it's place. Crab puffs were all dough - maybe 1/4 teaspoon filling. I really have nothing positive to say about the place. Not cheap, either for what you get. Tried it once and I will never be back.

So disappointing. We don't go to the movies very often so this was an outing I had high hopes for. No star theatre, no D box, no 3D, just went to a plain vanilla old fashioned movie. Unfortunately, we were in a theatre that smelled of mildew and where the back of the seat in front if you took up the bottom 1/3 of the screen unless you sat on your feet like a 6 year old. It was freezing the entire time.   The snacks were literally the worst I've ever had. I considered returning the soft pretzel since it was hard enough to yield as a weapon. Not sure how long something has to sit in a heater to get in that condition but it's not a good sign. The popcorn smelled amazing and tasted like old packing peanuts (not that I've actually tried those), and when my daughter opened the fruit chews in the kids pack they were old and dried out. Had that white crust on them.  Maybe we hit on a bad night, because other reviews are positive and upbeat - I'll give it another shot but won't pay for that sort of snack bar disaster again. I'll be the crazy lady returning her pretzel  for a new one. If you see me be sure and say hi!   Poltergeist was pretty weak, just as an added note.

Worst customer service I've ever seen. Last time it was just the food and interior that were bad. Today it's cash only because their credit card machines are down - no one is here, it's like a ghost town, and since I don't have enough cash for tickets and snacks I wanted to use my Groupon. They actually told me I couldn't use it because the movie is a special engagement!  Terrible management, terrible decision, I will never step foot in this dying theatre again.  Good riddance to ultra star.

Fantastic place right on the canal. Perfect shaded patio with umbrellas and greenery everywhere you look. Service was good, food was amazing - (the pear Gorgonzola flatbread and Korean cauliflower are must tries -  skip the avocado love) phenomenal ambiance and decor. Make sure to check out the market downstairs before you leave and pick up a pastry or coffee before you tackle a waterfront stroll. This place really announces "hey - I'm in Old Town - let's check out a segway tour." Can't wait to come back and try the sweet potato tacos.

AMAZING! Loved everything. Fantastic happy hour outing - the drinks we sampled blew us all away. ( try the black cherry, pink panther or green tea adult lemonade- two thumbs up for all!) They really have some fantastic cocktails.  We tried the potato skins, tacos, calamari, corn fritters and green chili Mac and cheese. Everything was phenomenal, fresh and delicious. Good portions, great happy hour prices and super tasty! The patio and inside are both comfortable and cutely decorated - noise level was average and we noticed that the crowd was perfectly eclectic -  little bit of every type. The service was great (special note that all the male servers are pretty easy on the eyes - love it)! We came early and by the time we left, there as a full house and things were getting a bit more hectic. I would suggest hitting the place for happy hour and going from there. Planning a return visit for next month already!

Everything a thrift store should be.  Cheap, vast selection, hidden treasures and one of a kind gems mixed in with garbage. If you're in the mood to hunt - there are great bargains to be had. Extra kudos for the book section - love it! This location is safe, clean, well managed and abundantly stocked. Employes are friendly and helpful. Balloons color indicate the color of the tags that are marked down even lower for that given day. Good stuff.

After reading the way the owner rips other reviews and their writers apart, I'm glad I have a false name on my Yelp account.  No signage anywhere indicating where Tranquil Massage was in the array of suites.  I've had multiple massage experiences and Rene was ok.  Not great, not terrible.  Having a coupon made this ok - full price would be a huge waste and not worth it.  Entire operation seems unprofessional and disorganized.  Again, seeing the owner tear apart any bad review is in poor taste itself.  Don't waste your time here.

Best customer service I've received in ages. I took up a lot of these employees time and I watched them greet, acknowledge, help, and ring up a dozen people without missing a beat.  Personable, attentive, knowledgable and efficient. I honestly believe this store fell from a different place and time.  Travis was tasked with assisting me in changing over my phone plan and did a phenomenal job with something that could have been a huge cluster. Thanks again to the Saturday May 31 shift. You guys seriously rock!

I was told about this place from a friend and boy am I glad she filled me in. I popped into fashion square mall and found Intimacy on the West upper end. Small store packed with many options. My "bra fit stylist" was Sotar, and she was amazing. Took what could have been a horribly uncomfortable and awkward experience and made it educational, fun and simple. She was extremely knowledgable and had me fitted in a few different styles, listening to my likes and needs and taking everything into consideration. She truly was phenomenal.   I left with a superior bra that cost over $100, (it's lace is infused with aloe vera for gods sake), but for something you use everyday it is so worth the higher price tag. I already have my eye on a few others.  The store has awesome specials, sales, referral incentives and a donation program. It is worth every penny to stop in and check this place out - and make sure to ask for Sotar - she's delightful.

This place is nuts. For students who are looking to score a position at a high end salon when they graduate - best of luck. There is always a huge cluster of students smoking right by the front door, (I've seen some light up right in the doorway)the level of incessant giggling on the floor rivals that of my daughters 6th grade birthday party, saw a student sleeping on a couch in the lobby today, girls dance, run around, swear and gossip to no end.  Why do I go here? I was lucky enough to find one of the elite students who actually cares about her future and does a stellar job every time I go to see her. When she leaves this summer, there is no forces in the universe that could get me back in that place. They need some babysitters/room moms/counselors to start keeping things under control. One Direction Zayn at the front desk needs to work on his charm and smile technique, also.

Great little shop in Old Town. Super friendly instructors, great vibe with music and a little bar set up. Cute shop area up front with boutique type stuff. Good prices and a huge  selection of stuff to paint. Everyone was helpful and wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. Will be back for sure!

Great location - super friendly staff that is there if you need but they don't stalk you throughout the store. The place is always well maintained, clean and nicely staged.   The products are, of course, wonderfully indulgent as at all the locations, but this one is a bit smaller and more friendly. I go out of my way to come here as opposed to Fashion Square or Tempe Mktplace.   There is always a sale or coupon to be had  and hand washing station is stocked with the latest seasonal offerings. Love this place.

Wouldn't honor an in store coupon that I left at home that they told me they knew was valid, then informed me they couldn't take an online coupon that I presented on my phone from a reputable coupon site. Suggested I make my purchases then return with my receipt and coupon to receive my discount. Thanks for making things convenient. I'll do my shopping online from now.

Ok. I had a bad day. The store is still super, clean, well organized, run by friendly and helpful staff and chock full of wonderful smelling products. I love the sales on seasonal products and the candles in this place are incredible. Great deals on signature products and hand soaps for days. Make sure to try out the new merchandise at the sink set up before you leave!

Cancelled both tours I booked and when I attempted to make a third, was basically told to just get my money back from Groupon. Extremely disappointed and had been looking forward to this for quite some time. Spoke to me on several occasions and didn't bother to write down my name or information. Poor communication and lacking in the customer service skills department. Will be booking with Destination Food Tours in the future.

I was really looking forward to a pedicure, relaxing, getting a bit of massage and pampering. What I got was thrown in a chair, a 30 second foot soak in room temperature water followed by a 28 minute treatment and rushed out the door. A party of 6 had an appointment and my guy had to switch from me to them and I really feel I got shafted. Maybe this isn't typical of their service but I was extremely disappointed and will not be going back. The owner who took my payment at the end didn't even ask how everything was or I would have spoken to him directly. What a lousy experience.

So I received a gift certificate for a pedicure here after I vowed not to return. Boy does the tech make the difference.  I had Tina this time and experienced a relaxing, pampering massage, a lot of tlc and attention to detail unlike my previous visit. Really nice service that completely altered my view on the place. I will be back (only with Tina) and hopefully a few of the other techs take note of these reviews.

Oh my god. I cant believe how amazing I feel. I only popped in for a quickie and received a 30 minute chair massage because the tension in my shoulders and neck were disrupting my shopping expedition - but I will be returning next week for reflexology and to become a member.  Clean, attractive facility in a convenient location in South Scottsdale, serene music and peaceful atmosphere, competitive membership pricing, family owned and very customer keen. My massage was given by the wife of the husband and wife owner team. She was incredibly gifted and knowledgable. What's not to love?  This isn't a day spa, so if you're in the market for a lot of fancy fluff go elsewhere and leave the place open for people like me. I'm so glad Yelp led me to this neighborhood gem.

Im really surprised at how many raves I've heard about this place.  The food is unremarkable.  Cornbread is dry, lots of gelatinous fat on the pork, brisket was tasteless.   Service was terrible.  Wrong drinks, no napkins, got our own silverware, asked for ranch and catsup twice before it came.   Super expensive and VERY noisy.  Still hunting for a good bbq joint to rival Kansas City.

The menu looks wonderful, but I think the actual food falls short.  Prices are pretty high for what you get, as well.  We had a groupon and tried it out, but don't think we'll ever be back.  The place is nice inside, somewhat sterile, the servers were friendly, but a bit confused and seemed to need a bit more training.  I don't think they'll attract much of a sportsbar crowd with their healthy options menu - but maybe things will turn around and they'll work out their kinks.

Awesome customer service - super fast cashiers - clean store -  fantastic meat counter - above average beer and wine selection - nice displays and arrangement of produce.  They always have a great sale going on for one thing or another and I have never seen any of their items that had turned or gone bad.  I adore the quirky guy who patrols the supplement section. He's chock full of information and always ready to answer any questions you may have. My only gripe is parking sucks (not their fault) and the lines have been known to snake so far back I end up buying a bag of bulk gummi bears when I hadn't planned on it.  A good tip is to avoid the store between 4:30 - 5:30 if possible. And bring back the lemon hummus Sunflower used to carry!

Not impressed.  Rude woman taking my to go order. I say "hi there - I'd like -" and I am interrupted with an abrupt "for here or to go?" No hello, no thank you, no come again. No personality. Just fired questions at me. This was not a busy time, for the record.  Filthy floors. Food, trash and napkins all over.  Egg roll was so amazingly greasy I took a photo and dumped it in the trash. I have never seen anything that weighted down with oil. It actually broke in half.  Low mein was unremarkable. Sort of bland and extremely light on the chicken. Maybe 4 or 5 small pieces.  I'll give this place one more try because previously I had a coworker pick up pad Thai for me it was quite tasty, but they need to step a lot of things up a notch here. Hope they pull it together.   And how hard is it to be pleasant to your customers? Sheesh!

Excellent all around experience. Friendly, super fun staff, qwick service ;), free wifi, phenomenal food, great prices cute decor and pleasant ambience. I'm so glad they put out a groupon or I wouldn't have thought to try them. Our waiter was super personable and lots of fun. Delicious moo shu, fried rice, walnut shrimp and crab puffs.  When we received our check at the end of the meal, it came with extra fortune cookies, high fives, lollipops for the kids and a 10% off next visit discount. A lot of higher end restaurants in this North Scottsdale neighborhood could learn a lot about customer service from Gary and his staff. Loved it!

I honestly have no idea how the food is at the Blind Pig - but the butcher shop inside, Hobe Meats, is awesome. I had a groupon for $40 worth of meat and was helped by Quinn. In this day in age Im not accustomed to dealing with someone who is friendly, helpful, amusing, courteous and seems to truly enjoy their job. Quinn was all of these. He helped me pick out the cuts of meat and even explained how they should be seasoned and grilled. I left the shop feeling like I had left another dimension - one where customer service still mattered.  Oh, and because of my wonderful experience, I now have plans to check out the actual restaurant - lol. Hopefully they match up

Everything was stupendous. The outdoor patio seating is cozy and comfortable - it's nice to see there is a place in Scottsdale that doesn't offer a "dog friendly" patio. I don't always want to be subjected to someones well dressed, stroller pushed, dander shedding, drooley "fur baby" while I'm enjoying a nice meal.  Service  from Erica was perfect - she is one of the best servers I've ever had. Friendly, helpful, perfect timing without lurking. She even took our late night coffee order with a smile on her face even though she had to get it from the restaurant next door. THEN there is the food. Oh my. Everything was delicious - first time in a while I didn't leave someplace with a box. The house rice, shrimp and corn tamale and chicken taquitos deserve special mention, but everything ordered was fantastic. The pineapple sorbet is actually served in a hollowed out pineapple. Tee hee!  It probably says something when you're looking forward to your next visit within 24 hours of your first. Check this little spot out for sure. No happy hour and pretty pricey wine options.

Best facial I have ever had in my life from Shana.  Amazing neck and shoulder massage include - soooooo relaxed and pamperd.  I paid extra for the peel (worth it!)   I will be going back for sure - no need to spend my money elsewhere when the prices are so great. Keep up the good work!

Martini and manicure night is definitely a hit here - the place was packed with ladies from 5:30 - 7:30. All the servers and staff were extremely friendly, service was spot on (thanks Sara!) and timing was great with everything. We had the risotto balls, mushroom pizza and meatballs - all were tasty. Great happy hour deals on food and drinks. The restaurant itself is super cute and aesthetically pleasing - patio and interior are both awesome. My only negative was the music was extremely loud - especially for a Thursday night before 8:00 pm. It was a nice intimate atmosphere before then, but we jumped ship when we had to shout across the table for a dinner conversation. Honestly - the guy playing was really good, just too loud for the time and place. I will be back again for sure!

Cute place hidden away in a strip mall on University. Love the look and feel, and the ambiance is nice but casual - great patio as well. Service was awesome - they leave green glass bottles filled with cucumber water at your table. Everyone we interacted with was helpful, accommodating and super friendly. Amazing happy hour deals on food and drinks - healthy pours on the wine were appreciated as well. They serve terrific Moscow mules in copper mugs also. Acoustic entertainment was phenomenal, not overbearing or loud and really nice to listen too. Hummus nachos, quinoa fritters, salut burger and stuffed avocado were all tasty. Too much good stuff to try for just one visit. A return trip is needed for sure!

First time here - just wanted to pick up some smoothies.  Awesome selection of combos, clean establishment, super friendly staff, I was served quickly and offered a punch card. Prices are a bit on the high side ($7 smoothies / $10 boxed meal) I would love to become a regular if it were a bit more affordable. Was hoping for better pricing. Healthy and tasty, just uber expensive. Parking sort of sucks if you hit the peak hours as it does for everything else in this plaza. Good for a once in a while place for me.

Really friendly, helpful employees. Amazing food - super fresh and delicious. Decor and outdoor area are fantastic, restrooms are clean and cute. Bakery has a small but tasty selection of homemade goods. I would visit often if I lived closer.  Love the community seating and carved pumpkins on the patio. Really nice lighting and ambience. Service was top notch. Definitely stop by when you're in the area - it's a hidden gem.

Visited mid week so small crowd and lots of room to walk and and enjoy the atrium. Fun because it's different  - not your normal way to pass the time.  Friendly and knowledgable staff, clean facility, organized exhibits and  centrally located right off the 101. We had no idea we would be able to touch the manta rays, watch ants farm and check out some bees and fish on top of the butterfly experience. It's pretty much a one time visit for me - but I'm glad I knocked it off my list of things to so. My favorite is the "butterfly body check" you need to undergo leaving the atrium. They search for stowaways. Lol

I adore this place. It's quirky location, secret entrance, phenomenal views and superb beer selection. I love the decor, happy hour deals, the amazing service and one of the top 3 cheeseburgers I've ever had. I cannot wait to return and have told so many people about this place Ive lost track. It's on the smallish side so definitely not looking forward to winter crowds - I'll be back before the birds descend. Do yourself a favor and check this place out. And don't get a salad. This is the spot for cheat night. Best pretzel bun I've tasted on the Ivan. The bruschetta is also fantastic. Think I'll be back sooner than expected...

Wait staff is awesome. Friendly, helpful and efficient.  Atmosphere is really cute and the lighting is perfect. Happy hour has phenomenal deals and the food is superb! We had arancini, poutine and bruchetta appetizers. All so good that we couldn't fit in the delicious looking pizza we had been eyeballing all night. You can watch it come right out of the oven while you're dining. Great wine selection and tasty after dinner coffee drinks as well. This is on my return list for sure.

The spa itself is clean, beautiful and relaxing. Amy at the front desk makes the most lovely fruit water drinks ever, and the facial with Shayna was hands down the best I have ever had. I have followed Shayna from another spa and this place is just amazing. She can get me in a relaxed, blissful happy place like none else can. Go for the serenity 90 minute facial - scalp, shoulder, neck, hand and foot massage are all INCLUDED - FANTASTIC! Also, everything smells incredible. I'm now a member and will be there monthly - cant wait to take my complimentary yoga class! Had lunch at Wildflower next door when I was through - what a day!

Go for the 90 minute service with Shayna you will not be disappointed - amazing facial - (try the dermafile upgrade) - phenomenal scalp massage - fantastic spa with superior customer service and truly gifted service provides. They carry great skin care products as well and be sure to check in with Yelp for your free aromatherapy upgrade. Trying the couples massage in the deluxe  suite next month!

Amanda and Jay Z were the most friendly, pleasant and helpful helpful staff I've ever had. Super clean establishment, quick and efficient service, amazing hot, juicy burgers, and ample parking make this my favorite Smashburger to visit. Love the sweet potato fries with smash sauce as well!

Already planning another visit here. Love this spot. Super friendly and helpful staff, comfortable, well done decor, amazing selection of coffee, craft beer, cocktails, pastries AND food. We were overwhelmed with options so this is most definitely a place you need to return to again and again. The patio is lovely and it looks right out onto Scottsdale and Goldwater.  They will be hosting morning yoga here soon. Try the Kevlar coffee. It's fantastic. Oh - and the Bavarian soft pretzel - delicious. OH! crumb cake - amazing! Vanilla latte - best around. Please check this place out and spread the word.

Looks like they have an awesome food menu. I just come for the drinks.  Fantastic late night bartenders / super friendly and knowledgable - they really take pride in their craft cocktail presentation. Seriously - this place can satisfy the most high maintenance of bitches. I love the patio and the overall ambience if the place - seems like a lot of service industry people favor the place and that's always a good sign. Best Moscow mule in town.... hope they replace their copper mugs that were stolen soon - hate drinking those out of glasses. Keep up the great work guys!

I like the pillows in the booths.  I dislike the length of time it takes to get a shot of wheatgrass. The juices and smoothies taste amazing and fresh. The prices are ridiculously high.  Clean, great decor, aesthetically pleasing. No patio or outdoor seating.

Fantastic food - perfectly spiced paneer and chicken tika masala. Excellent naan and paratha. Service was friendly, prompt and efficient. Prices were extremely reasonable - portions nicely sized. Hopefully beer and wine will be coming soon! We will be returning for sure.

Plus side - huge beer selection( they let you sample which is nice), awesome dog friendly patio, people watching is phenomenal, pretty extensive food menu, nice vibe - not too loud or sporty - all ages, genders and persuasions. Service is quick, unobtrusive and low key.   Negatives - too many beards. Employees are all guys in hipster street clothes, so any random bro in an American eagle t-shirt, faded flannel and two day old stubble can pose as your server.  Sort of odd.  I'll be back for sure.

Had become disenchanted with the Waterfront location so I wanted to give a different shop a try. Went in with a groupon and was all set for a five minute scalp massage, hair treatment mask and a fantastic blowout (as advertised) . I've had many before and have come to expect a pretty decent standard. I walked away with a 90 second scalp massage, no treatment mask, unconditioned, wet hair that was a tangled mess and finished hair that had no style and frizz. The girl doing my hair couldn't manage to get a comb through it once she had me in the chair. I informed her that conditioner would help and she told me she used spray conditioner - kept yanking the comb through and had to take brushing advice from the stylist next to her. The worst part of the experience was the customer service. Front desk knew I wasn't happy and let me walk out, so I took it a step further and emailed the store. Still no response days later. What a disappointment. If you're going to advertise specifics on a Groupon, adhere to them. I feel like corporate chains are really losing out to small businesses when it comes to customer service. These places just don't care anymore.

Worst spa experience I've had. If you're going to offer a specific set of services in a deal you should actually do most of them...  No in room music or sound machine. Bright lights left on. Table warmer had to be fumbled with for five minutes after I was in the room. I was booked with a male therapist and not asked if this was ok. Was told later it was my responsibility to ask. Cold towels left on back during the massage and more poking and pushing then fluid massage movements.  Facial starts with cold water. Was left alone in the room because esthetician needed to get tools that weren't where they should have been. Steamer issues and none of the extras listed were done. Sugar scrub on feet? Lip plumping treatment? Wild berry eye treatment?  I went in on a $128 groupon deal and 75% of the services listed on the deal were not done during my treatment.  I never call a place to complain but this bothered me all day. I called to let someone know, since they didn't bother to ask my opinion when I left, and I was brusquely put on hold and then offered a complimentary service in a month. No one wanted to hear my concerns, just shut me up. What a terrible way to do business. I'm extremely disappointed. My apologies to Naiomi who didn't want to deal with me and my call.  I won't be bothering you again.  Was told a spa director would be reaching out to me. A month has passed and still nothing. It's a shame you can't give a minus star for lack of caring and negligent customer service.

I have to laugh out loud that the first 3 bad reviews I read were all in regard to a salad. A SALAD. Who goes to Portillos Hotdogs for a stinkin salad? I don't know about their rabbit food, but if you're craving a greasy tasty burger, awesome chili dogs, perfectly cooked cheesy fries or loaded up big beef sandwiches, this is your place. Super busy, loud, ample seating and a pretty efficient ordering system are all expected on each visit. The one time I had my order screwed up multiple times, they apologized profusely and gave me cake.  Chocolate cake. On the house. Really? How can you beat that.  I can't judge their salads, then again, I'm not heading to Pita Jungle to try out their burgers, either.

Hey. Guess what. There's another place with wine and bruschetta in Scottsdale. They have happy hour, small plates, fun lighting and a salad with goat cheese. They have "up cycled" furnishings, exposed fixtures, gorgeous servers and kale on the menu. Extremely loud. Very pretentious - like 753 other places in town.Overdone and nothing new. Also - terrible parking and music is insanely turned up. Time to think outside the organic, gluten free box and try something new.
