So I have heard of this place from co-workers and friends and finally today I decided to go for it. I was not disappointed. I can eat.. A lot in one sitting and I enjoy tasty food. The amount of food you get for your money is awesome and the dishes are amazing.   Jerk rice, refried beans, and jade chicken in a quesadilla, with Diablo chicken was outstanding. Will definitely be coming back here and for sure going to tell everyone I know how great this place is.

Sushi is delicious and the choices are outstanding! The decisions so hard because everything on the menu looks great and they have all day happy hour Fri-Sat..... The combos on the happy hour menu were such big portions and they are really well priced. We decided to share two different combos, Sonoran and pacific combos and they are just really unique! I have eaten a lot of sushi and this place is a must try..

Their policy on asking for my ID for an energy drink is ridiculous.  I am 27 years old and in no way look under 21,  if you pay your cashier. 10¢ per ID request for my energy drink of course he will ask me for it....  But make a judgement call.  The manager there was sticking up for her cashier which is nice but make a judgement call as a leader and realize he was wrong.  I work in the mall and was in walking distance and just had my debit card on me.  No need for my ID of I'm just buying a Xience.  I have been there before and never asked for my ID but good old Greg at the checkout who makes probably $7.50/hr wanted his dime in his paycheck so he clicked ask for ID on my $2 energy drink.  Get real Total wine.

I have been to Thailand and had Thai food all over the U.S. and this place is absolutely amazing! Everything on the menu..(I've had like 4 different things ) but every single one is excellent!

The shawerma was amazing,  and the cucumber lemonade was so delicious!  I was skeptical about the lemonade but tried it and was sooo glad I did.  New favorite pita spot

Oysters on the half shell have become one of my favorite things as of late... They do not disappoint and the size of these babies are magnificent!!! The gumbo was divine and the shrimp pot was amazing.. 4 out of 5 mostly for price... A bit up there for what you get

Let me start off by saying that my score in no way reflects the service.... The cashier was not very friendly for it being my first visit. It was not busy so it wasn't like we were keeping her from helping other customers but for being our first visit, she seemed disinterested in answering questions about the menu. Ultimately I ordered what I thought would be good and when it was all said and done, the juice was delicious and I will definitely coming back! I tried the toxin flush and will try every juice they have on the menu

This place.... I don't have words to describe the beauty that is Zinburger.... Great atmosphere, amazing staff that is knowledgable about the menu and the product. The food though, is phenomenal! Great concept and I love me a good burger but I am not easily satisfied and this place has burgers down to a science. The French fry selection is amazing, we went with the spicy green chile fries and they exceeded all expectations. For the burger I had the El Diablo, while my fiancé had the weekly special and we loved both of them and even the dessert menu had amazing choices. If you haven't tried this place it's a must for locals and visitors alike!

So excited they opened this place right next to our house! We love the Val Vista location and this place is right on par! We had the Beef Panang, and my wife had the massamun curry (I obvi ate some of hers) and they were both delicious.  we will most definitely be eating here often!
