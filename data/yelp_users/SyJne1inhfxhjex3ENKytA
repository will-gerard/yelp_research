Good pies and simple but good food. While I rarely go to chain places this is where we came to get classic pie that is not on a diet.

Great food, great wine, great service, and the celebrity chef is entertaining as hell.   If you have ever been to a restaurant where the food is made with care- and each dish balanced to the palate so that you can have the full experience of taste in your mouth -then you know what this restaurant will serve you. The food is thoughtful, modern, well balanced.   We were at a wine dinner for Red Stitch - an exclusive winery that crafts wines for those who have great taste- and that Chef Beau was able to get them to Elements is a credit to his sway as a chef. Their wines- if you can get them (and they have them at Elements) are amazing.  Scallops- perfectly seared and cooked, combined with a freisse salad with a bit of mustard provides a perfect balance of the richness.   Dishes I would never eat other places, I would eat here - scallops, fillet - simply because those are foods many restaurants do ok, but here the bar is much higher.   The view- my wife and I love it.   If you want to impress a business associate, client, wife, girlfriend, boyfriend- if you want an amazing  meal - with a view, and a world-class chef -- this is the place.

They made me believe Kale could be served as a salad. They have the perfect ending to the meal, with a chocolate cookie sprinkled with salt - sweet and salty to end the meal. They have valet parking, because it is a busy place. Here are some things to try: The burgers: made with fresh ground beef, you can feel safe in ordering a medium-rare burger (as they are meant to be cooked). They have versions of this depending on your taste, or your sense of adventure.  The tacos: wife likes fish, I like short ribs. Wife likes lettuce wraps, I like the tortillas. Brunch on Sunday: amazing eggs, and brunch dishes - and if you like mimosa - well, they seem to not run out of those. HAVE THE SUNDAY: really - it is made the proper way, you won't be sorry because you ate the kale salad - its all about balance.

Fresh food, great flavors, deftly made, impeccable service. @Tarbells I accidentally wandered into this restaurant when it first opened in December of 1994 and have been a customer ever since.  The atmosphere is "cool" and allows one to feel comfortable arriving in a suite and tie or in jeans and a tee shirt.  The staff is welcoming and attentive to detail. There are seasonal dishes that are interesting, amazing and rare - and standby dishes that we love to order.  Things to try: House pulled Mozzarella with tomatoes - yes, it is a standard in many restaurants until you try this one, and this will become your new standard. The chicken fennel sausage with broth is one of the most incredibly complex broths that tastes like it was made with incredible care and precision. Pan roasted chicken is never dry, perfectly crispy skin. The vegetable plate is amazing, almost enough to inspire me to become a vegetarian. Fish of the moment - always fresh, flown in daily, prepared well - my wife loves the halibut. My son has gone there since he was born - he is welcome there, fussed over, and they always have noodles ready for him (home made). I cannot recommend this place enough

They pay attention to detail: The service is attentive without being intrusive. The food is delicious: Freshly made for each person - you would think this is a new concept, but apparently it is rare these days Decor is hip: Even my wife loves it -- Think of this place when you want a great breakfast Think of this place when you want a salad - and get one of theres Think of this place if you want a cocktail (and get a designated driver). Its a great place - put it on your list

It begins with a great cocktail and ends with salted caramel.  The bartenders have some unique variations of favorite cocktails that provide a perfect refreshment for the hot Phoenix sun. Artisanal cocktails are rare as snow in July in Phoenix and this place has them. Perfectly balanced bitters, liquors, and herbs.  The dinners provide variations of taste for any- from those who want fresh and light with tuna to a heavier short rib. But the squid ink risotto makes an atheist believe in a higher power. Tart, tangy and rich the balance in the risotto is rarely achieved today.  Desert- just do it

Pre-made food, poor quality, worse service If you think these steamed dumplings are amazing - then you have never had great dumplings. They were too thin, they were overcooked, and they were clearly pre-made. In fact, we were told as much.  The noodles were soggy and not quite as good as those you get from Kraft. The Steamed Buns- their fusion item - was thick, doughy and taco like- but without the flavor.  The duck was overcooked in the buns, the noodles, and the dumplings. The service was as slow as one could imagine. Sorry- but when you have had great Chinese food in China, this place ranks below any chain American Chinese restaurant (PF Chang's has better dumplings).  Hard to imagine that people would really like this place, when there are other places that have freshly made food. Atmosphere is nice- I imagine the next owner will improve on the service and the food

Decor is lovey and the food is average. The Moscow Mule should have stayed behind the iron curtain. The corn beef was "aged and cooked for half a day" translated it was too salty and had not have time to develop flavor. The fried chicken sandwich was as flavorless as a chicken breast could be. Service was good. Waiter nice. Kitchen slow and the bar tender needs an education. I would gladly have them decorate for me but not feed me.

In 50 states you come here to get Bbq. It is amazing, delicious, savory- moist. Care to every detail. Make time to come here if you like food.

Simple food done well. You might look at the menu and think that these are common American food, and how much better could the appetizer of shrimp and grits with sausage be than anywhere else -- the answer is, quite a bit. You might wonder how hushpuppies could get five stars, especially from someone like me who thinks that hushpuppies are from a bygone era when people began the road to obesity -- eat these and you will beg for more. You might think the chicken sounds like something mom made, until you eat it and realize that you have not lifted your head to speak to anyone in the crowd because you are hoping that no one will ask for a sample. You might think - ok, another steak place on the Camelback corridor - and then realize that this is amazing. Or you might think that the chicken soup could not be that great, until you taste it and realize that the next time you catch a cold you will be asking for a gallon or two of this. Then there is the peanut butter and jelly dessert - which people will cut you for if you try to sneak a bite.  The root beer (alcohol) float is not too sweet and perfect. The cocktails- oh just try them - hand crafted and delicious. Do not be fooled by the menu - go here, enjoy it.
