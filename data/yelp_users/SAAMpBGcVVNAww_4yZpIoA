Can't believe I've lived in Phoenix for 15 years and have never been to Herberger! Intimate, clean, well-maintained--not a bad seat in the house! Will definitely be back!

Wonderful (WONDER-FULL!) place for kids and adults alike. I don't mind paying full/adult admission for this place as there is just as much to do/learn/experience as with the child's experience.  I'm so glad I waited to review this place until today (we went Friday, July 13th) because I remember my husband and I thinking  that, aside from the wonderful Body Works and Grossology temporary exhibits, some major improvements, additions and renovations were in order... And I was SO impressed with all the nice changes since we last visited with our kids (then age 3 and 7; now 6 and 10) a few years ago.   ONE CAVEAT: If you live in the Phoenix Area, definitely opt for the membership, as just TWO VISITS make it worth the cost. (3 or 4 visits, which is completely reasonable just for the summertime will make the price even more attractive). Another complaint I have is the check-in time for non-members (20 minutes on line just to step up to a cashier; all the while my kids had to endure the taunting view of the outdoor water/balls exhibit and I had to subsequently endure, "Why is it taking so long?!").  Other than that, this place ROCKS! We look forward to going back and buying the family membership!

Okay, now that I've been here three times, I feel comfortable with a 4 star review.  Went for breakfast once and lunch twice. Everything I've had was deelish and the prices are very reasonable. The Croque Madame was a great satisfying breakfast sandwich (open face) that was a bit tricky to cut/eat but the Gruyere, Ham and tomato on whole-grain is top-notch. A sunny-side-up egg tops it off and you won't be hungry for a few hours... ...too bad because you'll want to save room for any one of the amazing cookies, bars, cakes and scones in their enticing bakery case. I highly recommend the red velvet bar and the old-fashioned chocolate cupcake (with white curly q's ala hostess).  The chicken salad sandwich is moist and tasty and served open-faced, while the hot pressed Cuban sandwich is wonderful on a cool day. Served with fresh pineapple on the side, each item is in the $7 range (very good for the serving size, IMO).  About the only downers were lack of parking and having to wait for a seat (when it's busy, which is pretty much ALL the time).

Artichoke Chicken Pita is SO good! Love their fries too--halfway between steak fries and shoestrings...never soggy...nice. Have had their burgers, gyros and Chicago-style hot dogs and everything is tasty, especially for its affordable fast food standards. They get really busy at lunchtime but you can call ahead. Staff has never been anything but friendly and efficient! A definite semi-regular goto spot for our family!

I really enjoy Nello's. Never had a bad experience. The food is always good, the service very friendly and knowledgeable, and the prices are reasonable. The problem is that my husand never wants to go there. He says that there are other pizza places that he (and admitedly, I too) prefers so we often skip it, even though it is just down the street. Panninis and salads are very good, in addition to their pizza, btw.

Sometimes months will go by and I forget about Rubios. Then I'll have it and I'm reminded how good it is!  The salsa bar rocks. Chips are free with every meal. Prices are reasonable. Oh, and they have some healthy options as well (the HealthMex tacos/burritos are really yummy!).  My husband LOVES their fish tacos--the original AND the grilled versions as well.

Okay, the name is bad (what were they THINKING?) but the fact is... this gelato is SOOOO Good.  When my brother visits from out of town, he drives out of his way to go to this place for dessert EVERY DAY. If we're out at a restaurant anywhere near this place, he always chooses to skip dessert at the restaurant just so we can have Angel Sweet instead. He's a chocolate freak too and he and I agree that the chocolate offerings at Angel Sweet are second to none. Unlike Gelato Spot, who doesn't always have a pure chocolate offering (usually they have hazelnut or almond in them), Angel Sweet usually has two pure chocolates that can be mixed with something else of your choice.  I love the fact that I can get two flavors of my choice even in the small size. Yay! So if you're craving chocolate-covered strawberries, go for the Super Dark Chocolate with strawberry, raspberry or any other similar fruity flavor--the pairing is wonderful! Also, if they have the Chocolate Cake Batter, that's a winner with Coconut.  And while I won't say that it's THE BEST gelato I've ever had--that goes to Glace Faite Maison in Ille. St. Louis in Paris--but I WILL drive out of my way to indulge.

Great place to come and sit outside for an after meal dessert with coffee/tea--or your morning coffee/tea and pastry. There is something for everyone.  Fruit tarts, brownies and pretzel bread are my personal faves. My kids get a FREE cookie when they come with me! Coffee and tea is full-service and the staff are always accomodating for special requests. Patio is lovely; service (counter only) is efficient and amiable.

I realized yesterday, eating breakfast--my favorite, the Feta & Roasted Veggie Frittata--that I've eaten here so much that I can honestly say, I've tried the ENTIRE menu!  When I worked full-time, I ate breakfast/lunch 3x a week at the Deer Valley location and since I'm in Ahwatukee, my location of choice is The Chandler Mall.  Love this place. The setting is warm. The food is consistently good and I'm always happy with the service as well. They also get major kudos for putting "build-your-meal" style nutritional info on their web site. That way, you can deduct the bread or the butter or whatever you don't want to eat (to fit your dietary restrictions) and still have an accurate calorie/fat/carb/etc tally. Love that! Wish Paradise would do that...

Went there twice this week for Happy Hour. Once to the Chandler location and once to the Scottsdale Mall location. I've eaten at both locations a few times over the past year as well.  Food: Very good. Always good flavor with being gratuitously spicy. Mushroom enchiladas are my favorite meal. I've tasted EVERY appetizer and they are all very satisfying. Good portion size for an app, which makes the happy hour prices all the more attractive!   Drinks: Happy Hour Drink prices are quite high compared to other HH's. Otherwise, I guess they're pretty much in line. The Chambourd Frozen Margarita is delish!  Service: Never had a bad experience with the wait staff. Friendly, attentive, and knowledgable. Seem to be perfectly okay with their tables ordering off the HH menu (some servers don't like the small tabs and it's reflected in their performance). Like I said, not a problem here (IME).  So this place always was one of our favorites and will continue to be until something changes.

Fantastic place for kids! Especially for young boys who love trains, like my two.  If you go for the "free stuff" like the playgrounds and the park, you won't be disappointed because what's also free is the model train museum that's been recently rebuilt (and developing every week as the create the new layouts). Such a nice place for a weekend get-out-of-the-house thing to do.  Of the paid stuff, the train rides are great, as is the carousel for this little ones. Check the hours though--not always running so you don't want to disappoint the kids if they see it and it's not open.  Hartleys is great for ice cream or a float and the toddlers can play at the Thomas Wooden train table while they lick.  If you like history, check out the Pullman car, used by FDR himself back in the day. Good stuff!  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!

So much more than a gym! When my sister or brother visits from NJ they are SO envious of my LTF membership!  "it's like a country club!" they say... Anyway, I joined in 2005 when I was pregnant with my second child and I've been a happy customer ever since. My kids (now 6 and 10) don't want to go to the Child Center anymore, but I can't complain--they went for 6 years and it gave mommy a much needed break several times a week! Thank you Lifetime Fitness for a great facility.

Saw Brian Setzer and his band years ago and the acoustics in the Ikeda Theatre were great; setting: modern and clean. Enjoyed a smaller production at the intimate 500-seat Piper Theatre and it was an equally ideal venue. Helpful, friendly staff all around (I'm assign volunteers?). Will definitely be back.

Spring rolls, egg rolls and Pho are just as good or even better than the best Vietnamese in other cities (San Jose, NYC and Denver, to name a few)...but the building, service and drink offerings are lacking. There's water and juice and...water... Kinda sucks to waste a nice Date Night outfit on this drab locale. So don't bother. T-shirts and flip-flops abound. The Lemongrass Chicken isn't quite as spicy as my husband remembered from "the old days" but he still enjoyed it.

My husband and I have been to the Tempe Improv many times, but after this last visit, I just can't justify the expenditure any longer...  Worst margarita I've ever tasted. At $11 each, with a 2 drink minimum, they're the most expensive house margaritas I've ever had as well. Yuck.  No belly laughs from me or my husband (or anyone else in the house, save the relatives of the warm-up acts populating the audience) for the entire hour and a half...  A few chuckles, an hour wait sitting in uncomfortable seats in a too warm room with bad food and drinks is NOT worth the $100 or so we spent on the evening. I think they should have to PAY US $100 to come back...

We tried them when they first opened in Ahwatukee. Did carryout. Ordered one of each style crust to see which we liked best. The answer was NONE. Bland crust and overly sweet sauce just did not appeal to any of our family members.  First time we ever threw leftover pizza in the garbage, rather than bag it for the next day... (I mean, who doesn't like cold pizza for breakfast?)

I've eaten at HOT for a holiday party as well as for dinner. Filet mignon was perfectly cooked on both occasions. The warm bread with "special" butter is a great starter.  Patio setting is great. Pretty garden with overgrown trees.  Excellent service.

I teetered between 1 and 2 stars...  I'm not sure what turned me off more: the guy (the cook, the owner? one in the same) who greeted me at the door in a white tee-shirt and sprouting chest hair (ala Simon Cowell, but decidedly NOT the pec-proud Idol Judge), the wobbly chair I was worried might break at any second, or the fact that it took more than 10 minutes to receive our drinks!  Not a good start, to say the least.  The pizza my friend ordered (the "Greek") was cold and "uninspired" and my calzone's crust was equally cold and bland--absolutely NO FLAVOR to the crust that supposedly cooks in a wood-fired oven, No burn marks, no crispness, nothing even approaching my favorite calzone from Cibo or Bianco in Downtown Phoenix.  Unfortunately, the prices were as high as those other establishments, which seals the coffin on this place for me. Put it in the ground and bury it!

No. Not even close to what a croissant should taste like. Very bland. Texture was all wrong--no flake! Yuck. The vegetables with the egg and cheese were cold as well.  My husband didn't have as bad of a reaction but we both agree we have no reason to return.

My sister and I had lunch here in Scottsdale on her recollection of us enjoying the TB in Orlando so much a few years back... I'd actually been to the Scottsdale location a few times for dinner since that first time in FL so I was totally up for it if she was paying. Another great experience! Long, leisurely lunch on the patio on a beautiful day... The warm bread with cinnamon butter was a great start with crisp mango iced tea. Then we had the Scallop Sliders and they were just as good as the first time; not too spicy and so juicy! Also tried the coconut shrimp--huge shrimp; sweet dipping sauce (might've benefitted from a bit of spice...) Absolutely LOVE the Crab Bisque!  And the Grilled Chicken Salad was much like you find in many other places (with Gorgonzola and Granny Smith Apples and bacon) but the homemade croutons add a satisfying, sweet crunch. And you simply CANNOT leave without trying the Piña Colada Cake! So light, not too sweet...and they offer a half portion so NO excuses. Try it, you must (as Yoda would say...)

Great patio. Been here twice now and the Crostini Boa is SO, SO wonderful--such a lovely array of flavors and textures! Ideal for a lunch/light dinner/late-night-nosh/appie ($15) with wine. I'm sure I'll be back soon!

After having waited for 2-3 hours for the "privilege" of eating at Pizzeria Bianca (on more than one occasion), I am SO glad that a friend got me to try Cibo instead. The food is just as good (similar, rather limited menu, so make sure everyone in your party is up for pizza & salads & wine), but the wait to get seated is MUCH shorter and the patio setting is LOVELY. Even the indoor seats are preferable to Bianca's open room brick box.  My husband and I get so excited for the cooler weather in Phoenix because we know that Cibo's patio is now an option for Date Night. Try the calzone and one of their great salads (i'm partial to the Omero but the Pear Salad is wonderful as well). A glass or two of the house Chianti makes it complete.  Oh, if you have room, the Crepes are delicious--share them with someone you love for dessert. Service has always been attentive, but not overly friendly (it's not that kind of place).

My first time at Sushi Eye was for a book club meeting for Happy Hour back in July. I mostly ordered cocktails and a couple of appie specials, which were okay but I wanted to go back and eat a full meal before I reviewed the place.  I stopped in for lunch on a Friday recently and was very surprised to see that between 12 and 1pm, there was NO ONE ELSE at the sushi bar and only two tables taken. Never a good sign.   The service was friendly and attentive, but what else did she have to do?  Since a lunch sashimi combo would've cost me $18 ($3-6 higher than most other sushi places for lunch), I opted for an Atkins roll ($9; pretty good; never had a roll sans rice before) and a $10 lunch combo with yellowtail sashimi (fine) and some Japanese dumplings (which came fried, yuck...would've liked to have a steamed option...and the sauce was tasteless). The miso soup and small salad was included and they were pretty much like all the other places.  Overall, I left wishing I had stopped at RA or Sushi Ken for a less expensive, more satisfying lunch special.

Honestly, I wait in line for the bacon.  Matt's bacon is not for everyone, that's for sure. Vegetarians, look away! 'cause this stuff is fatty, medium-rare, meat candy! The pepper sounded off-putting to me until I tasted it, and oh, how I enjoy it. Been there many times and whenever my Foodie brother is in town, he takes me there so he can get 2 or 3 orders of bacon. Great on the side of their Griddlecakes, which taste like a combination of a corn muffin and a pancake. De-lish. Worth the wait. Oh, and remember: this is a Divey Diner in an undesirable section of Downtown Phoenix--so SNOBS BEWARE! The rest of us will continue to enjoy the homemade goodness.

My hubbie and I LOVE this venue. It's one of the only places in the valley to see independent films and the location is fantastic, as there are so many great restaurants, not to mention the Fashion Square Mall, nearby.  Once a month, this place is a Date Night staple.  Only issue I've had over the years is the seating. It's "old school" auditorium, not stadium seating, so--as I'm a "shorty"--I often end up having to shift seats to find a clear view of the screen. Sometimes I'm tempted to get a child booster seat, but I'm not sure my butt would fit (kind of embarrassing if it got stuck, huh? LOL)

My husband and I finally tried O & I a couple of months ago and we enjoyed it so much that we returned last weekend and asked for the same server, who was excellent! The patio is gorgeous. Service impeccable. Food is great too. I really love their Focaccia Bread with Pesto that comes FREE when you get your drinks. Yum. We've tried a large sampling of their flatbreads, salads and appies and all were delish. My favorite was the bacon-wrapped dates and the butternut squash soup (I think it was a special). The server recommended a dessert on our first visit, which was exquisite, but I can't remember what it was...I just know we vowed to come back soon, which is always a good feeling when you leave a restaurant.

After a long workout, I was ready to EAT and craving a place that could offer up a tasty lunch and some special sweet treats to bring home with me (my favorite kind of place, I must admit).  I agree with some of the other reviewers that the atmosphere is nothing to speak of and the wait time is long--I went at 10:45am on a Wednesday; short line, mostly empty dining room/patio but I still waited 24 minutes for my meal. Inconceivable. If I was on my lunch hour, I would've made a stink with management. But because I was not in a rush and it was a rather mild day, I let it go. And for, that I was rewarded with a nice cup of Tomato Basil Soup with croutons (not quite enough basil) and a good (but certainly not great) Tuna Melt on whole grain and wonderful side salad with couscous and carrots on a bed of spinach (my favorite part of the meal). I left fairly happy...  But what really put a spring in my step was the Caramel Macaron that came in my little "Box of Treats". The rest of the items in said box (4 mini cookies and a mini brownie) were "meh" but the Macaron was to die for. I WILL BE GOING BACK--very soon, in fact--for some more of those. They had many different ones to choose from. I'll also try the breakfast next time as well. Hopefully, it won't take so long to be served!

Had a British friend give us a couple of these to try a couple of months ago (via take out) and even heated up at home they had us with that delicious crust. The "Oggie" and the Italian were loaded with lots of meats and each had it's own sauce to go with. Decided to try the place for lunch on Friday and the wait was a bit long, especially considering we were the first ones in the door at 11am. It got crowded really fast and ended up waiting over 20 minutes for our Bannoffee Pie dessert (which was SO, SO sweet but very tasty, taken in small bitefuls). Either way, the Rueben Pasty was very good but I wouldn't order the chicken pesto one again. Too heavy on the mushrooms and artichokes, not enough meat. And something about these pasties beckons for MEAT! My husband and I are both Cornish Pasty Fans.

I had been to their Happy Hour last summer and loved it. Appies and cocktails (extra pts for having "skinny cocktails") for $5 each. You simply must try this place!   Then...come back for dinner sometime when you feel like throwing down some serious cash for some seriously good eats.  I took a friend there last night as a "thank you for watching my dog while I was on vacation dinner" (her choice but I was totally IN) and she was SO happy! We started with cocktails: the Mango Mojito was nice but expensive but I REALLY enjoyed the equally pricey Coconut Frappe off the "Lifestyle--Under 150 calories" Menu. That little taste of cinnamon was inspired! And the sweetness really set off the salted/garlic edamame which is complimentary (such a nice alternative to bread, which always fills you up too much to enjoy your meal, no?).  We then proceeded to taste everything on each other's plates so I can personally attest to their 3-course Prix Fixe menu (app/entre/dessert for $37)--she chose the Pan-Seared Trout over Black Couscous (not fishy at all, a bit dry for my taste), the Dim Sum (which was nice but I needed a bit more of the Shiso Herb Purée, which was deelish), and of course the Chocolate Souffle (perfectly rich!). I opted for the Trio, which was on a Yelp special for 30% off ($24 instead of $36, yay! more $ for cocktails!) and featured a sampling of 3 of their most popular fish dishes: the Teriyaki Grilled Salmon (yum), the Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi (double yum!) and the Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish (triple yum!!). I can't believe I ate it all! And that's after splitting a Grilled Pear Salad w/ spicy walnuts and blue cheese (dressing was divine!)...whew!  In addition to all this gastric happiness we experienced, our service (from greeter/hostess to waiter to table-busser) was wonderful. Attentive, prompt, suggestive and friendly.   A wonderful evening!

For affordable, no-frills sushi, we always choose Sushi Ken. My husband works for a Japanese company and when the Japanese come to town, that's where they go for lunch; they say it's the most authentic for them. Now I know all you Hipster Foodies on this site (especially those who have expense accounts and don't mind paying $100 a person for "Trendy Sushi") will look down on the lack of ambience and menus with photos ("the horror"; so kitsch!) but I'm saying the Shashimi Combo (lunch or dinner) hits the spot every time.

I always forget to review this place! I've gone for dinner 4 or 5 times in the past 3-4 yrs which makes it about once a year...definitely good enough to return (we went last Friday night) but I think the reasons I don't return more often are: a) a bit pricey ($5 for a side of mushrooms is kinda crazy) b) menu is pretty limited and nothing is spectacular or even unique c) there are so many other restaurants--especially in that Chandler Mall area--that something else always wins out  That being said, I've never had a bad experience. Steaks/Prime Rib have always been cooked exactly as I ordered and the Salmon is wonderful too. Wish the dinners came with a vegetable or salad as well as the potato but, alas...  Service has always been attentive and the hosting staff never snotty. Like the dimly lit lodge look of the place as well.  Yes, I would recommend this place but with price/menu caveats mentioned above.

A while ago I was in for a lunch salad and I remember that it wasn't very...well, memorable. I drive by this place every day and I've never been enticed to come back and try their breakfast.   Until recently, that is...  Wonderfully hot, healthy and very tasty,--not to mention reasonably priced--breakfast wrap (happily made with my requested egg whites)!  Owing to the fact that I was "in and out" in about 8 minutes, AZ Bread Co. is now on my list of places to stop once a week for my "breakfast out" treat.   I also appreciated the friendly smiles from all employees!

REALLY love their pizza because it reminds me of what I grew up on at the Jersey Shore. When my family comes to visit, we always order NYPD (although they do balk at the prices--don't expect $5.99 for a pie at this place; but if you demand a better quality pizza, give this place a try!)  For lunch, they have a variety of pies for per-slice sale, which is great when you wan to mix it up. Their cold cut sub has tons of meat and is SO much more substantial than what you get at Subway! And the Pepsi from the fountain is the best tasting fountain soda in the Valley! The perfect amount of carbonation and syrup (I don't know why some places seem too heavy on one or the other; and Pepsi is so much harder to find at restaurants).   I love the garlic knots with a side of red sauce. Lots of garlic and butter. Yum!  I've tried all of their salads and my favorite is the Soho, which comes with a pizza crust base (very clever), so if you can't decide between pizza or salad, you don't have to with the Soho! The dressing is a very tasty combination of ranch and vinaigrette and it works SO nicely with this meal. Never disappoints.  The pizza is my favorite. My kids' choice too whenever we go for pizza. NY style crust and you can put anything you want on it. The Bianca and The Brooklyn are the adult's favorite and my brother favors bacon and pineapple. Always delish.  The zeppolis for dessert are my favorite. Hot, sweet and enough for the whole table!  Recently, I tried the calzone and I wasn't impressed at all. I'll be sticking with pizza/salads from now on. Oh, and we had a bad experience with their pizza cookie (rock hard!) once and never ordered it again.  Service is also always good, from the people who greet you at the door, to the counter help and the wait staff--consistently helpful and attentive.

My tooth broke--turns out it was a filling that came out, when I called, they got me in next day. Very courteous and efficient! Able to download and fill out paperwork ahead of time so my wait was minimal. Dr. Patel was friendly and efficient--and gentle! Very good experience overall on this first visit. I am very glad to have a new dentist close to my work. Highly recommend!

Pleasant young woman answered my call to this family-owned business. Her father Gene called me back same day with honest appraisal--no hard sell, no talking down to a woman driver (all of us have had to deal with that at some point). Gave me exactly what I asked for at a fair price (saved me hundreds over the dealership) and in a timely manner. Highly recommend!

Very good, very consistent quality pizza. Huge pies. Nice variety of toppings! I can personally recommend the "Top 2" on the menu (The Company Combo and the Chicken Pesto; so different that we split our 24" between the 2), as well as the BBQ and The Popeye. Have ate there and taken out 3-4 times now and NO COMPLAINTS. We will definitely go back but unfortunately, we have a few other closer places (Oregano's and NYPD and Vincent's) that are my family's "go to" favorites...

Finally got to try this place. Living in ahwatukee it was never quite convenient since I was in Gilbert on a Friday at lunch I knew there'd be a line, and there was... so expect to wait at least 30 to 40 minutes before you actually get your food. Is it worth 30 or 40 minutes? yes! Friendly, helpful service. The BBQ Chicken Pizza was smoky, tangy and sweet--deelish!

This is their new(er) location in the old KFC freestanding building, next door to their old location that got torn down and replaced with a Walgreens.  Hadn't been here in 10+ years (had a bad experience; sometimes that all it takes for me to avoid a place...even though I pass by EVERY day and see the parking lot full of cars). Really glad I gave them another try because my Chicken Chimi was super-yummy, with melted cheese, a side of sour cream and tomatoes, as well as rice and beans. I also got a side of chips and guacamole. Good stuff. Good prices. Efficient service too (in other words, the cashier spoke English, rang me up (complete with special instructions) very quickly, and the order came out exactly as I intended. Yay!  I'll definitely be back with my Mexican-food-loving-husband soon.

WARNING: If you bowl here, you may never want to bowl anywhere else again! We drive 20-30 minutes to bowl here, rather than the "other", closer places. We're not in any leagues but my family likes to bowl for fun 5-6 times a year and this is always the place we choose. Took the kids yesterday and did the $15 special for up to 3hrs bowling/shoe rental/personal pizza/soda/$10 game card--great deal!! We bowled/ate for 2hrs (kids lose interest and want to get to the arcade) and spent over an hour in the game room. The BUMPER CARS are the BEST! Especially since other bumper cars at theme parks/boardwalk piers often have a height restrictions that my 6 yr old doesn't meet and this one doesn't so he has such a blast spinning and slamming into his brother and his father ("watch that back, Daddy!") for $2 a turn. Even when we've gone to this place with adults, the setting, equipment, and service has always impressed. The food is even pretty decent for bowling alley fare (not quite Lucky Strike level, but good for the price). I filled up on the pretzel appetizer for my lunch while the kids ate pizza/fries (good fries; lotsa cheese on the pizza).  Anyway, for all the love I throw at this place, I do have a couple of complaints: Prices are high (roughly $4/game; $4/shoes) but if you're not going during peak evening hours, there's always great coupon/bundle deals you can take advantage of, so this is only a half-complaint. Also, they don't post their league times online so occasionally we've shown up and they've had leagues going and therefore, we had to disappoint the kids (after that long drive, it's very frustrating!), so call ahead! While we love the arcade, I have to admit that many of the games are out of order and that can also be very frustrating for the parents/kids.

My husband hates the Fair because his mom hated(s) the Fair. He's gone with me and the boys for the past 10 years because I've always wanted to go. I like the atmosphere, that it only comes three weeks a year...and I love the idea of traditions. Plus, the kids LOVE THE RIDES and I loved rides when I was their age so I enjoy seeing the smiles on their faces. This year I suggested a different plan: Mom will take the kids. We'll go on a day that's NOT a Saturday and NOT a wristband day. I'll be prepared to spend $75 a kid on rides (I spend more than that at Disneyland). We'll eat before we leave the house so that we only buy drinks and a snack ($20 limit). We will enjoy the FREE exhibits as much as possible, although admittedly my kids are not into animals--or the smell; oh well). We will go when Fair Admission is $1 or less and we'll park in the $5 lot. That day was yesterday: Opening Day. Great weather.  No bitching about prices (I set a budget, remember?).  No lines (we got there at 1pm and left at 5:30pm).  Had shady places to sit.  We found bathrooms and ticket booths with no waiting.  The kids were happy. I was happy.  We ate something deep-fried. We made a memory.  Me and my boys.

Returned here last week with my husband and we both agree with many Yelp  reviewers that, while expensive, the barbecue is tasty, the atmosphere is inviting and the service is friendly. We go back whenever we're up for sit-down, smokehouse flavor served up with Southern hospitality!

Had a great time! Bought some cool, unique, artsy goods from some talented friendly people (okay, one vendor was surly, but his stuff was so cool that I bought it anyway). Weather was cool and crisp and it wasn't too crowded so we weren't bumping into people all day. Parked a few train stops away in Phoenix and took the Metro in--much more fun for the kids!

Very cool place for kids under 10, better for kids age 3-8. There's a climbing maze on the first floor that--unless they've just unloaded a busload of kids--is a whole lot of fun for the kids to "get lost in" and explore" (parents are welcome to go with, but be warned: it's rather cramped even for this 5ft 2in mother so you may wish to wait "on the floor"...which is so enjoyable in that you can look up, walk around and admire the creativity that was employed putting this play structure together. The flying bathtub is genius! My boys especially love the "Bike Wash" with tricycles, the "Noodle Forest" and the "Racers" (cleverly built from roller-skate wheels and PVC pipe). Always enjoyable as well are the make-believe ice cream cart, pizza cafe and grocery store, as well as the "Ball Room" with umpteen pipes, ramps, and funnels for rolling balls of various shapes, thereby resulting in a cacophony of chimes, bells and gongs... All kids enjoy the vacuum pipes that push/suck/blow fuzzy balls and bundles of cloth in/out. Fun! While my kids are not interested in the Art Studio, we have walked through and it seems like they have some neat projects happening at scheduled intervals throughout the day...  THE ONLY WARNINGS I'LL ISSUE ARE THESE: It's expensive. When my kids were younger and I had one that wasn't in school full-time, we got the year membership for $135 (not sure what it is now but it paid for itself with just four visits with me and the 2 kids at $30 per visit) since we went at least 6 times a year... But now that the kids are both in school full-time, we only go a few times a year. $33 for the three of us is quite steep (I absolutely insist that only my husband or I go with the boys because they charge $11 for EACH ADULT as well!) and only worth it if you bring a lunch/snack and plan to stay for 2-3 hrs. Also, as other reviewers have noted, this place gets CRAZY CROWDED, especially in summer, and that can really ruin your/your child's enjoyment. Best go right when they open or 2 hrs before they close. One last thing: This is meant to be a Parent/Child experience. Those mommies/daddies that want to plop on the couch, set up their laptop and immerse themselves in work or social media should STAY HOME! The museum aides WILL tell you to stay with your kids and they will stop your unattended children and ask where their parents are.

LOVE the food here. Been coming for years but was prompted to write a review after my recent visit. LOVE, love, LOVE the setting at this unique little organic farm in South Phoenix. Wonderful place to bring out of town friends and family or visitors in the workplace.  Food is expensive but everything tastes so fresh and just a bit different than what you get everywhere else (such as Dates on the BLT and Butternut Squash in the Creme Brulee)..and all that greenery! Even in summer.  One of my Favorite Spots in Phoenix for sure! Bring a blanket. Bring the kids...enjoy!

I'm always willing to drive out of my way NOT to go to this place. The subs aren't bad but i'd so much rather have a Jersey Mike's sub. Something about the bread and those wonderful spices... Went to the Warner Rd. location today because my son insisted and the service at 11:30am was friendly and efficient.  The Turkey & Provolone on wheat was kinda bland, but I do love that they have Coke Zero (J.Ms doesn't...Boo!).

Where do I start? The instructors are great, but go a bit too easy on the kids, especially with regards to earning their belts... Otherwise, my main objection to this place is the cost. The first 6 months are $100/mo for each child (no discount for the 2nd; but the rest of the family is free after that) and every 8 weeks your child graduates (whether you think they really deserve it or not--let's face it, you can't "hold them back" if the rest of the class, including their brother, is moving on) and each graduation carries a $50 - $80 fee (for each child). Oh, and then there is the gear that is required: $40 for gloves; $40 for foot gear; $50 for a foam bat that can be made for $5 (but are not ATA approved, so you can't use them in class). All of this times 2 for my two boys. Then, on top of that, they are strongly encouraged to switch from the "basic" $100/month class to the "weapons" training $150/month class with even more weapons and gear to buy and tournaments to enter (don't forget those belt ceremonies every 8 weeks!)  Unbelievable that anyone could truly afford this. I'd rather put that $400-$450/month into their college funds. It will do them a whole lot more good in the long run.  Until then, we'll keep hiking and biking and swimming. Total cost: $0/month.

I met up with a friend yesterday for lattes and crepes. Perfect place for just that! This was my third visit but I hadn't been to CnC in about a year because I keep forgetting it's there!! I definitely won't forget next time I'm craving crepes 'cause they make 'em tasty here! The "patio" is just a sidewalk facing a parking lot but when it's nice outside, who cares? Our server was friendly, efficient and non-intrusive (thankfully, as we were definitely NOT in a rush). My latte was prepared exactly as I asked (special instructions that Starbucks often gets wrong somehow) and the servings are just the right size. I can personally recommend the Banana Nutella (just like the ones at Cibo!), the Strawberry Cream Cheese, and the Turkey Pesto. My friend loved her Strawberry, Kiwi with Honey.  Also, very reasonable prices.

My husband and I really enjoyed our first visit to Blanco last night.  Service was great (he even packed us up some salsa and chips to go!) and the ambiance is nice.  We started with the Crab and Shrimp Ceviche (big chunks of seafood; nice and crisp) and the Shrimp and Corn Cheese Crisp (grilled sweet corn complemented the sharp cheese SO nicely! Yum)  Our main meals were Tacos (Machaca, great flavor! and Roasted Chicken, which was way too salty; only bad note of the night) and we barely finished everything. No room for dessert but we were feeling fat and happy.  Will definitely return!

Too bad I don't live nearby, this would make our list of regular haunts for sure.  Fantastic Caprese appetizer with fresh, so soft mozzarella, crostini, tomatoes (I would've preferred more) and a pesto/balsamic glaze, enough to sop up with the pizza crust (much better than licking the bowl, which you'll want to do!).  Light and crispy calamari made the hubby happy, and if course he snacked on my Caprese--WHY didn't we get the large?!  The Roasted Mushroom Pizza was deelish. Piled with various mushrooms and quality cheeses. The crust is just that: crusty but soft, just as I like it. I split it with a friend so as to save room for dessert...  A Pizza Cookie, Red Velvet Cake or Mini Donuts were the main choices but when I saw that they had chocolate ice cream (yay!), I had to go for the cookie with that on top. BJs is the only other place that does that! Hot cookie, very sweet with the chocolate and caramel drizzles. Just what I wanted.  The patio would've been very cramped and I'm sure that the service wouldn't have been as attentive if it hadn't been 3:00 in the afternoon but our threesome had a great linner (late lunch/early dinner) all the same.

Didn't try the the hot dog cuz there was a "Willy Wueben" on the menu. It was darn good! Had a unique, homemade thousand island dressing and Dublin cheese--yu-um! So nice to have a cold Dad's Cream Soda out of the fridge with it! The place has a warm, kitschy feel with all the Steelers paraphernalia but don't let that scare you! ;) Very friendly staff. Attentive service. I'll definitely be back. Cooler weather makes me ache for home-cooked Pennsylvania grub...

Not good. The choices for salad are slim to nil. It's shredded lettuce, onion and cabbage with a few soybeans thrown in. My order took 18 minutes because I ordered the grilled chicken salad (even though they told me it takes 8 minutes to grill the chicken, which was so grisly I couldn't even eat it). What happened to the other ten minutes that I sat there watching all the other orders come and go? One saving grace: the shrimp was good, but it was cold since it sat around waiting for my salad. Ugh. Basically, it's about what I expected for the price. I may go back, but only if I'm NOT ON MY LUNCH HOUR...and someone else is paying.

All I can say to the people who think this place is expensive: You have never actually BEEN to a theme park that's expensive. Granted, we are Phoenicians so coming back on a season pass is obviously an option but even if you compare the other stuff to, say Six Flags Hurricane Harbor in NJ (we went a few months ago while visiting the family), this place is a WHOLE lot cheaper and so much easier to get around.  Lockers: $7 here vs. $20 at SF Unlimited fountain drink wristband: $7 (our family used one and we all shared) vs. not available at SF (but they DO offer a $10 souvenir cup that's refillable for $1) Parking:  $7 vs. $25 at SF (no, that's not a typ-o; and you'll feel like you walked to Philly by the time you get to the actual entrance) Food items were in line with SF but not as high as Disney/Universal.  My sons, age 7 & 10 had a blast today!  Also, I couldn't belive how quickly we got back to our car! Other places like SF and Disney you walk forever! Granted, they're a lot bigger, but I feel like there's so much wasted space around the entrance/exit points at those places.. Great park layout. Very clean as well. We'll be regulars now that the kids are old enough to enjoy all the rides.

Used a Groupon. Otherwise, never would have found this place (even though they are near the movie theater, they close before most evening movies get out so no post-movie-viewing treats...sigh)  I picked a half dozen cupcakes but I was disappointed to learn that they were "completely sold out" of cake pops on a Saturday at 1pm (they'd only been open for 2 hrs and I somehow doubt that they "ran out"...do they just not make them every day or what?)  Anyway, the 6 cupcakes that I tried were each VERY good overall: moist cake with chocolate chips in the chocolate ones and frosting that is not too sweet, My favorite was the Toasted Coconut and The Dark Vader. I'll be ordering more of these for a party next week, mainly so that I can try the rest of flavors--GREAT SELECTION that I look forward to sampling in the future.  And hopefully, they will have Cake Pops for me to try.  I probably would've given them 5 stars but the service was bland (not nasty, just not particularly friendly either) and the they really should have Cake Pops available on a Saturday afternoon.

My first few visits here would've earned them 3 stars but this recent visit really prompted a review (and a 4-star one at that).  Just wanted a quick bite before my movie started and was SO glad to see that this place hasn't gone out of business yet. Being from NJ, my preference will always be "mom & pop Italian" over Mexican or burgers or Asian...  Anyway, I know their lunch specials are built around the drink (that being where you save money) so I shouldn't have been surprised about the $4.65 charge for just ONE "Specialty Slice" of pizza (I had a water in my purse and didn't want to fill up on soda, so I opted for no drink). Sitting there, waiting for my food, I had utterly convinced myself that this slice could NO WAY be worth the price I just paid and after it was placed in front of me, the size of it did nothing to sway that belief. But OH, the taste! Now, obviously taste is HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE but my oh MY! That ham & pineapple slice was so dang good that I may never order from NYPD again! It's the day after and I'm still drooling over it. Crispy crust (again, this is MY preference over soft, chewy crust) with just the right amount of "crunch" when I bit into it), sweet tomato sauce and lots of cheese that stretched out before me and literally pulled me back in! Just the right amount of toppings was the icing on the cake.  I have found My Perfect Slice in Arizona.

Yup, it's as good as the ratings suggest. My husband and I fell in love with this tiny little gem from the get-go. Intimate but not stuffy setting, reminiscent of a European cafe. Staff was friendly and we got seated right away, despite not having reservations - that's because we eat early! (5:30) As for the food-- SO GOOD. We had a wonderful turkey soup and the scallops were perfectly cooked, and the preparation was so unique. Love that we'll go back again and have a different menu to choose from. Yes, we ARE going back. SOON.

Like other reviewers below, I waited it out for awhile before reviewing Hillside Spot. My husband and I were SO happy when they went in after our beloved Coffee Plantation left that we really wanted to give them a chance...  And now that we've been there separately, together, for take-out, sit-down, breakfast and lunch... I can honestly only give them 2 stars. It's horrible that I can't run over there for a salad when my kids insist on McDonald's because I know I'll wait forever and that my nearly $10 (with tax) salad won't have bacon or will be so small in its plastic to-go container so as to make me say "never again" and "I'd rather pay $5 for the Grilled Banch Ranch Salad at McD's. Ugh, I hate that I just wrote that! But at least they have my food ready right away and NEVER forget the bacon.  My first experience was way back when they opened and I loved their pancakes with bananas and creme fraiche and peanuts, but the side of bacon wasn't quite cooked right (I should be able to request "fatty bacon" and not get snappy-crisp bacon, right?) but since then, every time I've had them since, it tastes like the batter wasn't mixed thoroughly and I taste the egg... if I wanted eggs, I'd order them. And I have. The farmer's veggie omelet has always been to my liking and the coffee is fine.  The croque moiseur is quite good as well.  But overall, I'll agree with many of the reviewers in that the quality does not quite justify the expense, especially when you consider the wait time (25 minutes for a to-go salad and there was no one ahead of me on line!) and the generally indifferent staff.  I don't plan on trying them for dinner because I'm assuming I will come away with the same "meh" feeling. Sorry.

I loved 'em when I lived in Jersey and I love 'em here in Arizona!  Friendly, capable, conscientious crew at this location, as well as the ASU/Rural Rd. location.  Some people will have a problem with their bread but I've always preferred it to any of the other sub places around.  LOVE the Big Kahuna Cheesesteak (ask for them to make it with chicken to save on fat/calories) and I love the refillable Breast Cancer Cup, which makes it a bit more affordable. Also, coupons are everywhere nowadays so even though they are a bit pricier than other places, with a coupon it's a bit closer to their prices--yet SO much tastier!

This is my kind of place! A place where you can indulge but not feel bad about what you just ate... You certainly don't have to sacrifice flavor, presentation or quantity, as each menu item offers plenty of each. Had breakfast at PC on a different day and the front counter was VERY SLOW, despite there being no customers ahead of me. Courteous employees to be sure, but slow. TIP: Arrive between 10 - 11 am for a late breakfast or an early lunch. FAVS: The Mediterranean Wrap and The Scones are TDF! Overall, the food is wonderful but the prices are high ($5 for a glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice--where are we, Alaska???) and the service is slow.

Recently returned to Zinburger with my Foodie brother and felt prompted to write this review because he insists that the Kobe Burger is one of the best (if not, THE BEST) he's ever tasted...and he's been EVERYWHERE. Granted, he orders it rare, with a strange mixture of mozzarella, swiss, bacon and extra tomatoes but to see the look on his face when he's eating it (we've been here a few times now), it's well worth the $15-18. As for me, I've been here MANY times since they first opened and I absolutely love their Turkey Burger (I get it with avocado, bacon, cheddar and BBQ sauce) or Clint's "Almost Famous" Vegetable Burger - $9 with Smoked Mozzarella, Tomato Marmalade (but I hold the mayo; not needed). I love them both. Always perfectly prepared.  Oh, and a word about BUNS: they are placeholders IMHO so I don't like them to overpower the burger. In other words, they shouldn't be too thick or heavy and the taste shouldn't draw attention to itself and Zinburger's buns don't. They look thick but they're actually light and squishy so I can get my mouth around the burger with no problem. All the fries are great, I rotate between the sweet potato and the zucchini style. The banana cream pie is wonderful, as long as it comes out READY... Unfortunately, on more than one visit, we were given a pie slice that hadn't had time to set-up and was running all over the plate. Yuck. That should never happen. Management and wait staff should know better. The only disappointment I've experienced with Zinburger is their shakes. I think the ice cream they use is awful. My family has tried almost every one on the menu (with vanilla and chocolate variations) and not one has gotten ordered a second time. That's a shame, but in a way, I don't mind because I really don't need the calories anyway...especially if I'm saving room for Banana Cream Pie!

Seriously, no Chocolate or Red Velvet? Come on!!! Second time I've been here when they've had neither. Yogurtland had Chocolate Malt and another Chocolate variety. I'll stick with them from now on.

Finally saw their truck at The Willo Home Tour event. And I was hungry so I got two dogs: a regular wiener with coleslaw, Swiss and thousand island dressing. The other was called the "Bear" and seemed to be named a "7th inning stretch favorite" since it included peanut butter, Cracker Jacks and nuts. both very good but would've been better with melted cheese. The warm flatbread is a great touch and allows more toppings to surround the dog.  Service was friendly and efficient. I'll be keeping them on a short leash in the future...and look forward to trying more of their concoctions!

Been to LS in Phoenix a few times. Everything from a party of 25 (with kids) to a group of 4 entertaining out-of-towners.  Each time was a success but that success comes with a price.   The bowling  is expensive. $40 per hour for the lane plus shoes; we dropped $60 before we even ordered our first drink. That being said, you're paying for atmosphere and the decor is great, as is the service. Very attentive and they seemed nonplussed by the children running around. That's always nice (sometimes you just have to bring them along and kids love to bowl, right?)  Their menu is impressive as well. When my foodie friends come to town and decide against bowling because they hate "bowling alley food", this is a great option because this is definitely a few notches above typical alley fare! My favorite items are the Pretzel Dippers and the Chicken Pillows. Burgers are quite tasty as well. My husband had a salad that was spicy and satisfying. Food and drink prices are reasonable.  I've never been to their happy hour, but am planning an outing in the near future!

Stopped in to this charming little bakery a couple of weeks ago needing something chocolate, stat! The service was prompt, friendly and helpful and therefore, I didn't mind the slightly high price for these sweets. I tried the mini pistacio macarons (the French style, not the American coconut style) and they were very good since I waited for them to be "room temperature" like the counter clerk advised. But that really wasn't what I came in for... Let's get to the cupcakes: The red velvet and the chocolate peanut butter were good: frosting very light yet flavorful (light with respect to the texture/flavor, as opposed to the amount; I always scrape half the frosting off of a cupcake as I do not care for too much but I NEVER condemn a place that puts too much on as I realize that some people love a lot of frosting!) and yet, the cake portion was just a TAD too dry for my taste. The salted caramel actually disappointed me:   a.) I appreciate more salt and b.) I prefer a chocolate cake with my caramel My FAVORITE (and this one was so good, I would definitely return for more, despite living 30+ minutes away) was the BOSTON KREME cupcake. This one was very moist with chocolate icing (not fluffy frosting) and a small dab of custard? in the center. YUM-ME!!! Gotta' get me some more of those... ...now, if they could just make one of those with chocolate cake and white cream filling, I'd be in a More Cupcakes of Chicago Kind of Paradise!!!

Arrived at the tail end of Happy Hour on a Friday. Confusion at the hostess stand when we arrived and more confusion as to who was actually serving us.  Scallop Poppers were yummy and sweet but my husband had to pick too much "bad lettuce" out of his Seaweed Salad (I would've sent it back).  Pomtini was deelish but the Iced Tea was from the fountain (not fresh-brewed; yuck); ice water was foul as well. Off the dinner menu, went with the Tiger Roll (pretty tasteless), Monster Roll (which was sitting in a heap of Chiptotle Mayo and that's all I tasted) and the Red Blossom Roll (spicy; best of the 3). Sushi was served without soy sauce dipping dishes and we had to wait 'til the server stopped back to get some; then, the soy sauce pots were empty. Ugh. We used a Groupon so the overall tab wasn't too bad but I'd never be tempted to drive out of my way here again. Sorry.

I've been to the North Scottsdale location and this one is just as nice. Friday night we sat out on the patio overlooking The Scottsdale Canal (sorry, can't quite get into calling it The "Waterfront").   White Chicken Chili was fabulous, not too spicy and I ordered a side of toasted ciabatta bread for dipping/sopping up the wet parts. Yum.  One of their signature dishes was The Roasted Chicken--DEElish; so many grilled flavors on one plate; worth the 20 minute prep time!  Not quite a fan of the ciabatta bread used as a hamburger bun for the Kobe Burger (and the burger itself was only "okay") and the side for said meal was a bit of a turn-off for my husband and I agree that he should have been offered a different side with it...  Otherwise, great service, great atmosphere.  Yes, we'll be back (again).

The Dream Jar for dessert! Amazing. Rich. Not too much so I left feeling full, not sick-full.  All the food was great but we only got to sample the starters: Chopped Salad was my favorite, Chicken and Waffles a close second.  Service was ideal: friendly, attentive (and "invisible" for the most part).  My husband and I look forward to another Date Night here. Next time, we'll just order Entrees.

Friday night HAPPY HOUR and we were HAPPY! $4 Mules (ginger lime, yum!) and $4 basket (yes, BASKET!) of pretzel bites with provalone fondue. DEElish. Market Salad was fantastic. Fresh ricotta, grilled corn and just the right amount of dressing. Turkey Pastrami on Pretzel Bread was a great as well, but a bit small for $12. Service was excellent. He advised us on parking, gave us plenty of time between apps and the main meal and even managed to get me an extra drink for the Happy Hour price (it was 15min. past 6pm). Overall, a great experience. We will surely be back!

This has become my go-to self-serve yogurt place because: a. It's close to home b. My kids love their yogurt and their cute orange chairs c. They have the best, most consistently good flavors for chocolate lovers...my most recent trip they had Brownie Batter, which was dee-lish (made me wish they'd had this on that night I ate a BOWL OF ACTUAL BROWNIE BATTER!).  And now that they offer chocolate covered-almonds for a topping (I only take 4-5), that is the final reason I choose Orange Leaf over the others.

If it had just been based on the burgers, I'd have given it 1 star. I'm sorry, but I don't like a "bun-dominant burger", and these buns are dry, tasteless and overwhelm the burger. So, yes, I got rid of the bun and tried to eat the rest, but I did not expect (nor appreciate) that "hidden spice" in my veggie burger and definitely did not like the chipotle in the BBQ sauce of my husband's BBQ burger. Not everyone likes spice so I'd have liked the option of sweet BBQ sauce instead. Ended up with a root beer float (okay, but the soda machine got stuck and sprayed me an my son; not cool) and fries gleaned from everyone else's plate. Fries were good! Just the right amount of crispiness, not too skinny, not too fat...and you put your own amount of salt on them. My son didn't like the dark deep-fried breading (Panko) of his Kids' Menu Chicken Fingers, so I ate them. Very fresh. Good for me; bad for him.... My other son did not finish his kid's cheeseburger so that's a bad sign (he ALWAYS finishes his burger). The staff was friendly and management was very gracious for taking the uneaten veggie burger off the bill but it was still too expensive and not a good enough first-time experience to return. Sorry.

Had to pay $1.50 for a parking spot out front. Not a good start...  12:30pm on a Friday and there was no line. Another bad sign...   The atmosphere was bright, urban hipster. That's cool. The service was prompt and friendly. Lots of goodies in the display case. Yay! Things are looking up.  The Blackberry Jasmine Green Tea was crisp and fresh. Only sat for a few minutes when my food was delivered and boy, did it look good!  Unfortunately, that's where the good part ends...  It may have been the prettiest Tuna Melt I've eaten in a long time but it was also one of the worst. I used five napkins--FIVE!--to sop up all the dripping mayonnaise from this tuna salad that was spewing all over my plate/side salad/table/lap. Yuck. When are restaurants going to learn that you only put enough mayo in tuna salad to hold the ingredients together??? I'm sorry, but if you hold up a tuna sandwich and it all drips out, you've done something wrong. Such a shame because it really did look pretty on the plate...   I was even more disappointed to find that they drenched the side salad in WAY too much balsamic dressing, so I abandoned that completely.  And the final nail in the coffin was the "Ncounter" signature dessert which is a combination brownie/oreo/chocolate-chip cookie. It was $4 and I only took one bite. SO DRY! Ugh.  I had wanted to try them again for breakfast sometime but I really doubt that I will.

Oregano's has been a favorite restaurant with our family since before we WERE a family (circa 1998). Even though we've never lived close to any of the locations, we've had so many great moments (and honestly, in 13 years, only ONE bad experience) at this local chain. We had our first date on University in Tempe and we had our wedding celebration party (after eloping to Australia) at the Scottsdale location. The front patio at the Mesa restaurant was the choice for my husband's 40th birthday party.   Always great service! Great atmosphere (friendly, fun) and great food. Our two boys now love to come with us to the newest location (near our home in Ahwatukee--thank heaven!) on Elliot Rd in Tempe which will surely be our new local hot spot, as it is near my husband's work as well. WE ARE SO EXCITED!  My favorite items on the menu (although I admit, I'm finally steering away from my usuals so that I can try the rest of their extensive menu):  Kick BUTT Garlic Bread (be sure to order it with cheese and a side of marinara)--YUM! Guaca Tony (I only recently tried this and am sorry that I've been missing out all these years)  Chicken Ceasar Salad (dressing is SO good, and there's never too much of it)   The Sproccoli Deep Dish or Stuffed Pizza - have a little salad, which comes out quick; then wait another 20 minutes or so for the Chicago-style pie--SO worth the wait! (and so filling, you'll have leftovers for lunch the next day!)

The patty melt and a chocolate malt. My favorite "cheat day" (or "cheap day") indulgence.

99 cent cupcakes on Sunday! They're a bit small but deelish! So much so that I'm officially moving my "Trader Joe's Day" to Sunday so that I can partake on a regular basis...  I've been in a few times now and everything is presented well in the case. Lots of variety. All their pastries--cupcakes, cake pops, macaroons, tarts and especially the eclairs--are VERY good. The eclairs had the perfect, freshly made custard filling and lots of chocolate on top. My favorite item so far.  The shop is cute; nothing special.  Prices are very reasonable. $1.99 cupcakes and cake pops, as well as most other items. Love that, 'cause then I can buy more stuff!  Service has always been friendly and apologetic for the wait (every time I've gone, there's been a line, which is good I guess).  As long as they stay open, I plan to be a regular.

Just like Jersey bagels! Love that I can get my old favorite, Salt Bagel with Veggie Cream cheese. I took a star off for not having Light CC and the drink selections are pretty lame.

The chocolate custard gets 5 stars. It's what keeps me coming back. And how awesome is that little "mini" size so I don't get crazy and eat a HUGE Chocolate Malt (which I can, but don't want to!). Lots of malt, rich chocolate flavor--YUM-ME!!!  As for their burgers, just okay for me. They're the flattened out, cube-steak style, which is Meh but I do love the big pickle and onion slices. 3 stars.  Shoestring fries are also not my thing so I'll pass on those next time and try the onion rings. Maybe a Patty Melt is in my near future...'cause I know I'm going back for that chocolate custard!

The kids wanted Five Guys but my husband and I wanted sushi... A bunch of restaurants are all clustered here at the corner of 7th & McDowell so we got to do both! Sushi wasn't bad. Staff was very friendly and helpful, even suggesting alternatives with our choices. The Slammin' Salmon was deelish with cucumber and strawberry. The Spicy Tuna was great with asparagus. Love the concept.  Not sure how quick the line moves when the place is busy but I'd definitely go back.

My husband and I have been going to ALL of Pita Jungle's locations for over 13 years and the consistency, friendly service and good food was always expected and delivered. Not once have we had a bad experience.  Love, love LOVE that Ahwatukee now has their own PJ with AMPLE OUTDOOR SEATING. Best place for fresh, crisp iced tropical tea or a glass of wine. Great art (often for sale) on the walls and delicious pitas... My fav's for lunch are the Chicken Philly Pita (ask them to add mushrooms if you like), the red pepper hummus plate, and the Lavosh Schawarma Wrap. For dinner, their fresh fish dishes are always prepared in some tasty, unique way...love the Mahi Mahi with Pita Chips and the Broiled Chicken Salad is huge and satisfying...yum! Desserts are very tasty too, if you have room for some Baklawa or Carrot Cake.

HOLY AMAZING BBQ! This is the kind of place that makes me think, "Thank God I'm not a vegetarian!" The smoked meats are terrific, namely the Brisket (moist) and the Turkey (who knew BBQ could be guiltless?! And SO delicious--only about 200 calories for a half pound), which is so juicy and flavorful it doesn't need sauce. My husband and I did Take-Out so we didn't have to deal with the lines and that went very smoothly...so friendly and helpful was the counter girl that he asked if he could tip her--she said "not allowed" (which was cool). We tried a little bit of everything on the side: potato salad was egg/vinegar style (no bacon or onions) and we both enjoyed it. The cream corn was rich and tasty but a bit too sweet for me (wasn't expecting that; almost thought it could be a dessert). The BEST side we tried was the Green Chile Stew which had a kick but not too much. Very nice! For dessert I was just going to taste the Peach Cobbler (I gobbled it all up!) and the banana pudding (with Nilla Wafers and whipped cream, nice but could've used some real banana chunks).  I'm from Jersey so my opinion on Texas BBQ carries very little (if any) weight but I can say that the smoked meats are wonderful and they allow you to put your own sauce on ("Original" or "Sissy") which I like because sometimes I don't want ANY sauce. I am already planning my next visit! Yay!

Yay! I finally got to try this place! I pass it every day but I never have the time to sit down...  Definitely lives up to the hype. I love the build your own and my Turkey, Gruyere and Mushroom was DEElish. One crepe is not all that filling (and that's true no matter where you get a crepe) so I had room for a sweetie to finish me off--the strawberry custard crepe with chocolate was Oh-so-good...and the beautiful cup of cappuccino topped it all off. Trés Bon.  Yup, I'll be back with the hubbie next time!

Music. Art. Food trucks! Woo-hoo! And we bought a robot! His name is Norton. He's made of tin cans and such... My husband and I had a great time!

Gosh Darn It! They had to be good. I was hoping, since they are so close to my home  and right next to where I shop for groceries most often (Fresh & Easy), that they'd be horrible. Then I'd never have to go again... But, alas...too good to not go back, that's for sure!  I've said it before, I'll say it again: if you don't like a lot of frosting, just wipe off the portion you don't want. Heck, if you're sitting next to me and my kids, they'll eat it for you!!  I didn't think I was much of an frosting fan either so I wiped off most from the Chocolate Chip Caramel, only to find that the milk chocolate frosting covered with a caramel drizzle was UH-MAZING! Scraped that heap right back in my mouth where it belongs! Yum. Equally impressive it the dense, moist cake (as opposed to light and fluffy texture; these puppies are HEAVY). The White Chocolate Raspberry was chock-full of white chocolate chips and the frosting was not too sweet. It was the prettiest one as well, with white sprinkles and raspberry sauce drizzle. Thoroughly enjoyed the two other chocolate selections (Texas Milk Chocolate & Midnight Magic) as well--Yes! I had four, but only cut them in half so I could save the rest for (my husband) later.  Bonus points for presentation (the box is adorable) and variety.

Great fun for a Sunday in February! Classic cars, classic homes, vendors and --the best part--FOOD TRUCKS! Gorgeous weather helped make it a fun day out with the fam.

First time at this chain. I love the Carrot and Raisin Salad--just like Mom used to make! And the Charbroiled Chicken & Fruit Salad was really nice. The Berry Balsamic dressing goes perfectly. Would've been nice if they offered some sliced almonds with it but oh we'll... Staff was incredibly friendly and efficient. I'll be back for something sinful next time.

You know it's bad when the leftovers don't get eaten. Actually, I didn't HATE the pizza. It was meh for me. The dough had a moist, dense, chewy texture, which I didn't mind but my husband and son were wishing we'd gone to Oreganos (actually, they would've preferred Pizza Hut for those prices!)  Tried the Mellowterranean pizza which was quite bland with very few toppings and the turkey & cheese hoagie on rye pretzel bread (completely devoid of flavor--how hard is it to offer mustard or mayo?)  The "pretzels" are just pizza dough twisted into pretzel shapes. Since they were hot and salty, I'd have to say that was the highlight of the meal.  Ambience is nothing special; don't quite understand the movie theatre theme as it's really only the entry area. The large booths are nice the back seating area is wide open to the kitchen, which can provide entertainment in the form of swirling pizzas and tossed dough but it also means we see that pimpled teens are cooking the food and not really caring if the dough hits the ceiling. Yikes.  A Groupon enticed us to try it but nothing will likely get us to go back I'm afraid....

Really like the Tempe location but LOVE THIS ONE!  We always go to Tempe because it's closer to home but many times we just do take out because it's so college-bar-dark-and-dreary...  Now we have the open air bar feel that is SO much more appropriate for Arizona. Yay!

We were fans of the Scottsdale location and now we go to the Biltmore Blanco at least once a month... My kids don't eat Mexican but they have burgers and fries in the kids menu so that takes care of that (I know, leave them home, right?). Love, love, LOVE the shrimp cheese crisp with grilled corn to start.  The chips and salsa are perfect because my hubbie and I both enjoy it (rarely do we agree on salsa; this has more of a smoky flavor than spicy). And I've now tried every style of street taco and I love them all so I just close my eyes and choose 3 different ones each visit; they never disappoint.  You can mix it up with sweet, smoky and spicy--all great and not too filling. My only complaint is the somewhat high prices and sometimes slow bar service...

4.5 stars. Three visits now! Still living this place... Friendly, helpful service. Cute, inviting interior with Cracker Barrelesque gifts available for purchase. Ample outdoor seating with parking lot views (could use some potted trees). Oh, and the food, can't forget the food! Their French Toast is fantastic. Thick homemade bread lightly dipped and served with sliced strawberries, whipped butter and caramel syrup--I was told it's unlimited but two slices will fill you up for sure! The breakfast sandwiches come standard in a croissant but we opted for the ciabatta bread and, while a bit big for the egg, bacon and cheese, it was so fresh and soft! So much easier to eat than the tough ciabatta bread at most places. The orange juice tasted fresh-squeezed and was an appropriate $3 versus the $4-6 they charge elsewhere. Took a couple of chocolate chunk cookies to go and they were soft and yummy! We are going back. And soon!

I could have sworn I had already written a review of this place but apparently not... I've been bringing my sons here for more than 10 years and I've never been disappointed. It's a huge indoor jungle full of trees to climb, tunnels to crawl through and slides the twist around and around. There's a mini zip line too. You've never seen your kids this sweaty (indoors)! They have a cafe with the usual pizza/salads/snacks (you can't bring outside food or drink) as well as a parents wi-fi lounge and an arcade. Overall, the pricing is reasonable ($21 gets me and the two kids in) but beware of the arcade; best to keep the kids away or you can easily drop another $20. The place has been painted/updated since the last time I was here; it's clean and the staff are friendly. I recommend MI for girls or boys but it can be a bit scary for kids under 6.  Best time to go: weekday afternoons!

Been to the Biltmore location many times but my wedge salad was drowning in dressing, the food took WAY too long to come out and I took a bite of my son's burger and almost had to spit it out. The banana cream pie was great but that graham cracker crust needs a hammer & chisel to get through. Love the wide open location! Overall, much too pricey for what you (don't ) get.

Get 'em - and eat 'em - while they're hot! Something for everyone, that's for sure!  Love the concept but even with the very clever ordering process (you see photos while waiting in line and use sushi-like ordering sheets once you've decided; good luck with that!), I can imagine it takes quite a long time to get your order if there's more than a few people in line. FYI-it took 10-15 minutes to get ours and there was only one family in front of us...  But that Bacon Bomb doughnut was pretty darn good.  So if you've got the time and you've earned a little treat, do give it a try!

DA Rocks! My husband and I participated in the Cozy Dinner for Two Class last night and had a GREAT time.  It's just enough hands-on so that you get the idea but not so much that you're exhausted at the end and and need a nap. Wonderful group of couples do in' "the Date Night Thang", everyone had a great time, got some good tips and the meal was DEElish! TIP: Get there a half hour early, go across the way to V95 Wine and Coffee Lounge, have a glass of wine (they'll even suggest something that pairs well with the class menu) and relax or get a bottle at 30% off that you can take to class and enjoy with the group! I have to give a shout-out to Chef DA's support staff; they were very helpful and took care if all the cleanup. Best Date Night in awhile... GOOD TIMES!

So happy they opened an Ahwatukee location! Always friendly, efficient service. Stores are bright and clean. Lots of awesome flavors and combinations for shaved ice--my son recommends the SourPatch Kids flavor - a tower of sour! I love their smoothies (working my way through the menu but the Colada is my fav). Nice alternative to frozen yogurt.
