Worst nail job I've had in my life. Didn't do what I asked and began chipping off next day. The actual nail not just the polish. Then even after I went back in and requested them to fix them my nails (it's been 4 days) have began cracking. There is bubbles in them. Horrible:( and a waste of mula to go here.

My favorite Mexican restaurant in Arizona and one of my top five favorite restaurants in general. Great prices, great staff, and amazing food. Need more locally owned places with this quality in Phoenix.
