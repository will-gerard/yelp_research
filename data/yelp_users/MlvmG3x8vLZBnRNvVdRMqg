The ice cream was delicious however I gave it one star for horrible customer service. The girl who works there made it seem like such a hassle to ask for samples. She has such a horrible attitude, I understand if it was super busy but it wasn't. Very disappointing experience especially after hearing all the rave from people about how good this place is.

I've read positive reviews about this place yet I've never actually stopped by, sad really because I live walking distance. I finally decided to check it out and I will definitely be back to get a taste of the rest of the menu. I had the refuge mixed green salad and it was absolutely delicious. The salmon bruschetta was also delicious and that's involving the fact that I'm not all that crazy about salmon.

This place is great! I can't get over how delicious the tortillas are. Most people think of a burrito and think of all the things that go in it but the secret to a great burrito is the flour tortillas. This place nailed it. Next time you order a burrito stop and smell the great smell of their hand made flour tortillas!
