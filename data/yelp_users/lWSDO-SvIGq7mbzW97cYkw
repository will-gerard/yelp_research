This museum is really interesting for adults and super fun for kids. We spent two and a half hours here, which is a long time to hold the attention of my three kids, especially with how small it is! It was very interactive and they had a very large play area for kids with lots of cool things to do, including a farm truck with crates, play food, and a place to "plant" and "harvest" the food, some dress up clothes, and a small stage with curtains and theatre seating so the kids could put on a show. A highlight is the music area that showcases the history of local musicians, it is also very interactive. And to top it all off, it's completely free! We all had a blast.

The guy who helped me was super nice, but charging me $1.50 plus the printing fees when I could've sent what I needed to print online for like .10 is ridiculous. Barely any box size choices and what they do have is expensive for what it is. Again, their customer service is fine, the policies and prices are terrible. I will be avoiding this place next time.

Beautiful views, nice trails, really fun playground equipment. They also have a neat discgolf course, a dog park, and an archery range. Don't listen to Cecil, this dog park you can definitely enter!

Really delicious flavors and mix ins, fair prices. I'd like to come back and try their local slow brewed and cold brewed coffee. Clean, well organized. Only reason I didn't give five stars is because the back row of mix ins are really awkward and difficult to reach underneath the sneeze guard for a tall person and the seating choices were not super great for children. No indoor tables and chairs, just couches and coffee tables.

I have three kids, six, five, and three years old and we had a great time. We bought a groupon deal and got an xl popcorn and five sodas and bowled two games in two hours. The customer service was really great, the alley is clean and looks great, great prices even without the group in deal.

The whole place seems filthy and sticky and smells like dirty bathrooms. It's like a nasty chuck e cheese but for bros. The food is so overpriced too and just not very good. I left feeling sick and like I needed to take a shower in antibacterial soap. Two stars because the servers were okay and I don't think it's their fault this place is gross, sorry ladies.

Filthy, too busy, horrible layout for the playground area, and there are bees and wasps everywhere. The train and carousel are overpriced. Not a fun park.

Really fun, huge, shaded playground area with a large variety of playground equipment. Many nice ramadas, benches, and huge grassy areas.
