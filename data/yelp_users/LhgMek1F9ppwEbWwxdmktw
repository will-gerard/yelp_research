Cafe Posada is one of Gilbert's best kept little secrets.  Its a great little restaurant you've probably driven by many times on the corner of Gilbert and Ray rd.   You've got to try the Carne Asada or the Pollo a la Parilla.  The never compromise on the fresh ingredients and you won't be disappointed.  Pleasantly Surprised!
