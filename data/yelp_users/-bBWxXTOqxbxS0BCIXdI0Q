This place is so unassuming and in a shopping center so you may never really put it on your list of places to go - but you SHOULD. The food is EXCEPTIONAL. The service is always wonderful. This is one of the places that could make it in a high traffic area/snooty location because of the food alone, but it's nice they are a neighborhood favorite. Seriously get the margarita pizza and the fettucini.

Okay if you are dieting then this place is a godsend! The buffalo chicken pita is under 300 calories and incredibly filling. In fact, they have all of the calories and nutrition listed on the wall. The service is always quick and friendly and the food is great. Perfect for a quick lunch bite.

The best OBGYN practice you will find in Phoenix. Dr. Hlavachek is caring, attentive, and a real person that connects with you as another woman, not just a patient.

I have always loved this place for red wine on the patio while listening to the live flamenco band during the fall. But I had their fancy brunch this past weekend and LOVED it as well! Unlike the other overpriced brunches in Scottsdale resorts, this one had attentive service and a good selection of lovely food. Skip the Phoenician, The Royal Palms, and the rest if you're willing to drop the coin and come here instead.

This was the best bodyshop experience I've had in Phoenix. These guys are professional, and quick, and courteous. They didn't pull the whole "well, we are waiting on parts" deal that most shops do, nor did they let my car sit on ice while they collected a storage fee while waiting for parts. My service writer was awesome and kept me up to date on all things and they actually delivered the car ahead of schedule.

I adore the new concept store, and not only because we work with this brand (our disclaimer - we work with them, but were not incentivized to write this - there you go FTC, happy now?)   You have to experience the interesting way that BR has taken the boutique format into one store - very easy to segment your shopping and really nice if you are shopping with your husband as he can go to his own side and you can meet up in the new, amazingly comfy dressing rooms.  If anyone is in this store - ask for Vincent. He's an amazing help and can find clothes to fit your body the right way. He used to help me at Ann Taylor in the Biltmore and I'm happy he has transitioned to this store.  The sales "room" in the back is a bit crowded and can be a beast, so be prepared to strongarm for the really good deals. But the rest of the store allows for good shopping room and the sales staff in generally helpful and nice to deal with.  Be sure to follow them on Twitter - some great secret deals can be found.

As someone who was a big fan of this place for years in California, I have to say that for many reasons, this would be the your worst choice for breakfast in Scottsdale. Our previous visits have always been filled with ridiculous waits for OK food and a very dirty table. This past weekend, we had the added bonus of a bitchy hostess/manager that actually mouthed off to one of our party and was completely rude and unreasonable. Please do not give your money to this establishment. (Besides, they only take cash...)

Holy waffle sundae! Love this place. The wait, as with every place in Scottsdale, sucks. But the food and service were outstanding. The waffle sundae was excellent as was the chicken wrap.

This place is amazing. I'm a very short person so i live at the tailor. This place is quick, reasonable, and super nice. I've had everything from sweatpants to a formal gown altered here with great success.

Amazing, amazing, amazing food. One of the Valley's best kept secrets. Seriously - I dine at the "top" places and the food here beats the heck out of fancy lunch anywhere. I suggest the custom salad - really fresh ingredients, and the California Turkey. The pizza is pretty darn good too!

I have to say that I'm a big fan of Sushi Brokers. I am what they call a pansy sushi eater - i.e. i think a California Roll made with soy paper counts as sushi, and the very smell of fish makes me nauseated. However; more than one time now, I have been able to try affordable sushi, that doesn't stink, and tastes really mild and yummy. And that to me is a total win. The service has been less than good on all occassions, but the happy hour pricing and great food makes it worth the try.

Seriously one of my all time favorites in Scottsdale. Consistently good steak (please tell me you'll never go to grain fed bland beef) and equally great people watching in the bar. If you get some time or are hanging with friends, grab dinner in the bar while the piano man sings. And you must simply get the mashed potatoes - they are amazing. Additionally, they have a great price on Caymus Conundrum.

This place is fantastic! I big puffy heart the red velvet pancakes and the orange juice was delightful! I've also dined there for lunch in the last week and split the kobe burger and the turkey wrap with my assistant and both dishes were flavorful, well-prepared, and really interesting. The fries are delicious and the service was amazing as well.

I adore this place. Not only do they use the freshest ingredients possible for those "make your own salads," but the team that works there is usually really incredibly helpful and hard working. The California Turkey sandwich is incredible.

Love, love, love this place. The food is excellent - especially the pork shoulder dishes. The services is quick and friendly. And the owner who we met at my birthday was a delight. I highly recommend this "hidden" gem.

This has become a consistent favorite for us since we had the baby. They are always accommodating - giving us seats in the back JUST IN CASE - and making alterations to the recipes because of my breastfeeding (TMI, I know...) The food is great. The prices are right and the chefs are really nice.

Being a fan of expensive and interesting cuisine, I have to say that this place is one of the few that in the food category get it right in Phoenix. The concept of the customized menu and course selection is pretty amazing and certainly something you should share with out of town guests, or a great date. The service was actually some of the best I've ever had in Arizona.   On the downside, the decor is lacking and doesn't match the level of the food or service - a flaw in design for sure. (For a $115 meal, I expect more than cafe decor and a a stinky bathroom with exposed plumbing issues.)

I found Fuzion well before they were a client and love them immensely. With my crazy travel schedule it was hard to find a gym that had some flexibility. Fuzion has been able to keep me on track through travel. I also adore the cleanliness and their "sweat in style" moniker - I hate large scale gyms with trainers that at meathead or kids that don't really know anything about overall health. The trainers at Fuzion customize your training to your needs and your schedule - and the pricing is incredible.  Amanda

By far the best service I have ever received in Phoenix - and I am a frequent high end diner. It was like being in the South where hospitality and a smiling face is like a law. And the food: fattening wonderfulness that truly delivers exactly what they promise. If you're looking to indulge (or find some authentic grits) I highly recommend this place.

I make terrible pancakes and could have done a better job than this place. After reading about this place in Phoenix Magazine touting the Reece's pancakes, I was stoked to find another breakfast place in the Valley to try. Boy was I disappointed. The overpriced pancakes were the consistency and dryness of microwave pancakes and instead of having the candies mixed in, they were just on top of the dry mess. The tomatoes were not fresh (for my tomatoes and cottage cheese) and the rest of our guests had similar dry and uninspiring food. The service was great and the lack of wait was really nice on a Sunday. Parking is horrific since it's near the Ice Den.

Just another overpriced Scottsdale restaurant where more money was spent on decor than food creation, and beauty in the servers is clearly more important than the service itself. We ended a progressive dinner here on my birthday and it was the worst experience ever. During our visit, the only thing they had to accomplish was taking drink orders - as the cold, bland, dry, gross cupcakes were already on the table in the gorgeous private room. We had an hour allocated and weren't served drinks until 10 minutes prior to our departure time. While the manager (or someone) did reach out via Twitter (a kudos) the bottom line is that the experience was so bad that no one in our group would even consider returning if it were free. Don't be fooled by yet another restaurant that is pretty, but sucks. Go enjoy overpriced dining somewhere that can deliver a whole experience. You owe it to yourself.

Right up there with Katz's deli in NYC. Amazingly perfect pastrami on a true reuben. Excellent choice for brunch - especially since the line didn't start until noon (a "miracle" around here.) For any reviewers chatting about the lines/format/menus - it's likely because you've never been to a real NYC deli. This place is that, exactly. And nails it. Great work!

Hands down the best salon in the world. I've been going to Kelly for over 10 years now (wow, that makes me old) and he has never, ever let me down. The experience in the salon is what matters: great cuts, amazing color, and an incredibly knowledgeable and fun staff that has a passion for making you as beautiful as possible. Amazing, amazing, amazing.

Terrible food that made me sick. Awful service. And oddly enough, I got the same interaction regarding "sides" that others have posted here.

I'm a pretty picky hair person considering I don't have amazing hair. Lauren is amazing and the salon is well-run. It's comfortable, stylish and the staff all knows how to do great hair. I love coming here. The customer service is amazing. They know my name when I walk in. The lather lounge with hand massage (which is complimentary) is amazing. I highly recommend this salon over all of the other she-she salons in Scottsdale that are all fluff and no outcome.

I am a very picky restaurant patron and this place won me over! It's a total hole in the wall where the chef is right in front of you preparing really amazing meals. The wine suggestion for me was spot on and the chef made some changes to help with foods I could eat. Don't expect a overly decorated Scottsdale like place. It's very much self put together. But the food is to die for!

I've been here three times now and have yet to have a bad meal, or walk away complaining. The food is consistent. The prices are fair. And the service is great. Nice hidden gem without stupid long waits at breakfast. Score!

Best grilled cheese with ham I've had in years. Service was amazing. I've heard that the breakfast is great, so I am going to try that since it was also suggested that the wait, unlike at every other place in town on the weekend, isn't painful.

Holy mother of salad goodness...I have finally found a replacement for the sadly now-closed Market Bistro. The sandwiches are interesting and have amazingly soft bread. The salads are fresh and generously portioned with dressings that are tasteful. The desserts are also yummy. This place is my new favorite and go-to at least once per week. And for $8 that gives you a FULL sandwich and salad (which you can easily split) - paradise bakery must be freaking out!

These guys are amazing. Brian has been with us for years and he is so professional and friendly. He knows my kids names and knows that I work from home so let's me know via text when he's coming as to not scare me. They also did our sealing of our house for scorpions and it was so helpful!
