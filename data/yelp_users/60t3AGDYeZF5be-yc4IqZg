Instead of writing a review, I'll just submit the letter I sent to the GM regarding my experience: Good morning Mike,   I am sending this email to you to inform you of one of the most outstanding customer service experiences I have ever encountered. As a consumer that is currently working to correct my not-so-great credit, you can imagine the struggle it has been to purchase a car.  I had gone to a few other dealers before finding a listing for the KIA Soul online linked to your company.  Needless to say, those experiences left me disheartened.  Even when visiting with the "alternative funding" department at one dealership, I was still treated in a way that left me feeling as if I didn't deserve to be respected by anyone because of the number on my credit report.   When I called on the ad listed, I was connected to Court Johansson.  The first thing I let Court know was my actual credit score, which has been my practice to each dealership I have contacted.  Court did not make me feel as if I was missing brain cells--he was compassionate, and I could actually hear the sincerity in his tone when he said he had a good feeling he could help me.  After the initial phone call, we communicated over email and on Thursday afternoon he let me know that what I was looking for seemed attainable.  At this point I still didn't have my hopes up, even though he was much more respectable than ANYONE I had spoken with thus far, I know that my "score" is not ideal.  He let me know your office hours, and that he would not be in at the time I was able to come by,  but Jim Rule would be apprised of my situation and ready to help. Thursday when I pulled up, Jim was already standing at the door waiting to greet me.  With a giant smile and a demeanor that made me feel comfortable, he immediately eased any residual apprehensions I had from my previous experiences. Jim and I talked numbers and budgets, facts and warranties and at no point did I feel this was his sales pitch. It was apparent that he was a good man that was honestly trying to help me attain a goal.   When he came back to me after speaking with Joey Graves and crunching numbers, there was not an ounce of pressure.  I made the decision to purchase because it felt right, and for no other reason.  Joey spoke to me about the financial information in simple terms--nothing overwhelming, he explained everything which left me, yet again, feeling confident I had made the right decision.  I settled in to sign the paperwork and was then astounded by the customer service I continued to receive, even after I had said "let's do it!"  Jim bought me dinner, cleaned my new car, emptied my trade (which I can promise you was a task in itself!),  brought me water and kept me feeling confident all the way until I left the lot.    Far too often people that deliver this type of service are not thanked or appreciated by the customer.  I haven't been able to stop talking about how wonderful my experience was at your company.  I have spread the word, I will continue to send as many people as I can your way.  You need to know what special men you have in those two.  They changed my thoughts on car 'salesman' forever.   Please be sure to thank them for me once again, and please recognize them for some outstanding service. They made it apparent I wasn't a sale to them, I was a person and they showed me respect from the get-go.    Sincerely.   Melanie Deuby A VERY Satisfied Customer

Let me start by saying I live in Central Phx - I drive to Gilbert to get my nails done by Apple.  She makes sure that you have exactly what you're asking for.  I had requested stiletto nails the first time I went to this salon and was pleased but not ecstatic.  I came back for a fill and was seen by Apple. She immediately knew my nails were not exactly how I wanted them. She said "I'll shape them for you and you will love them". She was right. I have gone back to her only for my fills. It's worth the 35 minute drive!

Fast? Check. Cheap? Check. Relaxing? Uhhh.. not even close. The entire 55 minutes of my manicure I had more then one person trying to upsell me on something. Gel nails, white tips, parafin dip, pedicure - you name it..  I just wanted a quick manicure on my lunch hour so my cuticles were looking healthy.   My nail tech was sweet as can be, the others and the atmosphere is a whole other story. They state they accept credit cards, however there are signs hanging all over stating if you pay with a credit card, the cost is higher.   If you are able to stick to your guns, and can tune out yelling - for $9.99 you can get a decent looking manicure.  Otherwise, I would look elsewhere.

Soooooooo. My friend and I came here because 1) it is walking distance 2) hello Mexican food and 3) it's always busy. I I don't know if they were short staffed or just the most unorganized bar?  When we sat down (at the bar) we were greeted promptly and given a water. We ordered our beers and then waited. And waited and waited. The main reason we went is my friend was starving. We finally found someone and asked for food menus. We were given A menu. To apparently share.  We then waited 15 minutes for anyone to come and take our orders.  Once our order was placed the food did come out promptly. I had nachos and they were covered with fresh cut veggies and totally delish. He had the Mac & Cleese with pork which he also loved.  Not once did anyone check on us.  Not once did anyone ask if I wanted another beer - my glass was empty for 10 minutes.  What if we were dead?!! No one would have noticed!  The manager maybe owner appeared to have possible ingested PCP intentionally and was skipping behind the bar hollering. Honestly, the food was good. That's why there are 2 stars...The service was horrific.  I won't even begin to describe the confusion on splitting our check.  Bummer about this. I was looking forward to  our ladies brunch here.

Best grilled cheese ever.. EVER.  It's super dark in here - like very almost uncomfortably dark if it was a first date, or someone you didn't really know. The entire room we were in was lit by only 5 votive candles.  The music was good, the food was awesome.  It was a good stop off the light rail  - only about a 6 minute walk.

A group of us went for a birthday dinner because of a Groupon that was purchased.  I am a FAN.  Two of us from the group went back for lunch less than two weeks later and the ambiance was just as accomadating for a conversation between the two of us as it was for a dinner with six friends.  The food is delicious. I recommend the Roasted Garlic, Goat Cheese and Arugula bruschetta.  They have 1/2 of glasses of wine during Happy Hour as well.  This is for sure becoming one of my favority cozy spots.

Here is the deal. I have raved about this place to everyone - forever. Great deals, fun atmosphere and being vegetarian I love the asparagus roll. The last 2 times I have gone there have been issues. Today was the final. I didn't see asparagus on the conveyer so I placed an order for the rolls. I waited 28 minutes. When I finally flagged someone down and asked about my rolls they said "they are making them now". Another 10 minutes and we finally ask for the check. When he is tallying up the plates I said "hey I don't want to be charged for those rolls cause I have been waiting 30 minutes" he shrugged. Someone in my party said "what happened why did it take so long?" The server responded with "I don't know sometimes they just don't feel like making it". My friend said "are we allowed to sometimes not pay?"  The server went to ring up our total - in plain site- and stood there mimicking and making fun of our table. When he came back with the bill I said "is that funny over there?" My friend said "were you making fun of me over there?" Here is the kicker - he said "yeeeesss".  After bringing us back our change he THEN said he was sorry. I said that should have been your first response. We let him know we will not be back, which bums me out because I really did enjoy this place. Granted, it's like a buffet wherein you serve yourself.  However, there are servers there to refill your drinks, take your special orders and so on- you should still have a sense of customer service.  I really hate to not return, but I'm not.

Everything about this place was sweet. The atmosphere, the service and the food was perfect. We went based off Yelp reviews and it was so worth it. I can tell you its not a quick jaunt from the Lightrail, especially in August.. but after eating we realized it was so worth it.

You want results fast? Do this boot camp.  Not only does Jennifer, the trainer, offer you your first 4 weeks for FREE - NO STRINGS ATTACHED.. you actually enjoy what you do.  You feel the difference after just 5 days.  I am starting my 15th day today and I can actually SEE the difference.  I am pretty sure I'm annoying everyone I know because a good 65% of my conversations start with "today at boot camp" ..  LOVE IT!

If I could give this place less than 1 star I would.  Intitally the salesman I spoke with on the phone was awesome.  I confided that I don't have the greatest credit, and was transfered to the  "alternative financial solutions" department.  This is when it all went down hill.  It was dirty, hot and disorganized.  (I had an appoinment and he couldn't find my paperwork) The sales/finance man I spoke with gave me metaphor after metaphor for having 'less than desirable' credit. When I stated I saw the car I was interested online he told me that particular car could have not exsisted.  I said the original salesman I spoke with even gave me details on this car.  At that time he stated 'salesmen lie to get you in the door'.   I went there interested in a  KIA Soul. He took me out on the lot in the 90 plus temps, pointing out cars that were NOWHERE in my interest, or even price range.   When I stuck to my guns, and all was said and done the offer that was presented to me for the Kia was something I would have expected at BMW dealership. During this verbal raping, the first salesman all of the sudden remembered the car I saw online and told me it sold over the weekend.  This is where it went from awful to worse.  The manager of the department came over to speak with me since I declined the 3 outrageous offers.  I must say I have never felt so disrespected and 'sold' by anyone.  It wasn't a shock that I had bad credit,  I disclosed it at the beginning of my call, and it was the topic of conversation during the entire appointment.  But this manager (who also kept calling me the wrong name) tried to make me feel bad about my credit score, and implied that I wouldn't be able to get a car.  It was a run-on sentence of verbal berating.  He actually said to me "don't you think if everyone could have a $300 car payment for a $25K car, we'd all be driving Benzos?" That enraged me. I again mentioned to him, the department manager, that I saw this car online and he said 'we would have never had something like that, it probably didn't have air conditioning"   I wasn't looking for anything over $16K and kept repeating that.    I finally left brow beaten and embarassed.  However, I found a wonderful dealership Freeway Chevrolet, where I purchased a Kia Soul, for the price I wanted without anything less than total respect and pure confindence in my decision.

Ok so the first time we came in this place they were closing. But decided to not tell us, we were the only two in the restaurant and the sushi was obviously end of day sushi.  However, we decided they deserved a second chance. Today was the day; my friend and I went in at 1pm. Once again we were the only people in the restaurant.  The server seemed shocked to have customers, and didn't understand why we were entering? There are about eight TVs. All were on. All were muted. The sushi was from who knows when.  You could hear a pin drop, again.  When two other customers finally showed up after we requested the tab, we tried making eye contact to warn them - no.. just go. It's not worth it.  Finally as we were leaving the server turned on some music.  We decided that it must be a four patron minimum for any ambiance to be initiated.  You can get the same quality sushi at Fry's in the deli than in this place.  We wanted to love it. We gave a a second chance. It got an F again.

We brunch monthly and have attempted to go to Snooze more than once. We finally decided breakfast instead of brunch this weekend and it was WELL worth the wait.  We got there at 9am on a Sunday and still had about a 30 minute wait, however, they send you a text when your table is ready - so you are able to actually leave the premises. The inside is soooooooo freaking adorable, and everyone we encountered was very friendly.  About 10 minutes after we place our order our server arrived with a complimentary Nutella Banana Pancake that was huge and for our table to share.  She just showed up with it! One of our brunchers is 7 months pregnant, and you would have thought she won the lottery.  I'm not a sweet breakfast person, but this was honestly delish.  Everyone enjoyed their meals, the prices are beyond reasonable, and we all decided we need to make this a regular outing on top of our weekly brunches.   OH and I love that they have so many vegetarian options.  Honestly - so happy they opened in PHX and are just around the corner from my home.
