SO delicious. my husband and i stopped by last night for dinner (after months of talking about coming down). first of all, the place is adorable. it was not insanely hot last night (finally!), so we were excited to sit outside and enjoy some awesome food. i ordered the pulled jackfruit po'boy, my husband ordered the chicken parm special, and we shared a side of fries.  wow. just... awesome. as a vegetarian, it's sometimes a bummer to eat a veggie burger or vegetable sandwich over and over again. nothing makes me happier than to find a menu that has something really cool (and vegan) that i can eat. the po'boy was not easy to eat (my only gripe!), but i definitely did my best and ended up using a fork to scoop up the jackfruit that didn't make it in the sandwich. the bbq sauce is awesome, just the right amount of salty, sweet, spicy, and tangy. the coleslaw was fantastic as well, and the baguette it came on was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. so yummy.  my husband really liked the chicken parm, but can't wait to come back to try the bumblebee biscuit. the fries were also awesome, nice and crispy with a really yummy herbed aioli.  service was great. beer was local and delicious. food was wonderful. music was fun and super loud. all in all, definitely worth five stars.

The best chile con queso outside of Texas! I always get the Border Chimichanga with black beans.   The staff is pretty knowledgeable about what is and isn't vegetarian, some more than others. For my boyfriend's birthday, we went with a large group (meat eaters, vegetarians, and vegans), and the manager was able to tell us what was and wasn't cooked in lard, what was and wasn't vegan, and basically, how everything was made (aside from the chips, which are sent to them bagged).   Some of the best Mexican food I had was while I was in Austin, TX, and when my friends from ATX came here, I took them to Nando's and they LOVED it. They said it was some of the best queso they'd ever eaten, and I think that is a great feat.   My boyfriend and I go here often. Even though it is out of our normal few miles of regular dining, we make an exception for their huge portions and delicious food! it's a little pricy, but totally worth it!

My first experience with Ethiopian food! I was hesitant, as it is a cuisine I knew little-to-nothing about, but holy moly - I was so surprised. Four girlfriends and I ordered the vegetarian exclusive (I believe it's called) which is meant for three people, so we also ordered the vegetarian platter meant for one. We hardly finished the exclusive, there was so much food! Everything is SO tasty. I was worried about the injera, as I have friends who don't like the consistency of it. I really loved the fresh sourdough taste of it, though, especially mixed with the flavors of the different wats.   After my first visit, I was so excited to take my boyfriend there - we made dinner plans with friends of ours within two weeks of my first trip! I absolutely LOVE Lalibela and it is quickly becoming one of my favorite stops for delicious vegetarian food!

My first time at Green, I was unimpressed.  My second time at Green? I fell in love. The employees are all friendly (and even helped me out immensely when I lost my phone in their trash can - it was the worst :( ) and when I asked them what I should get (I love actually being able to do that!), the Original G was recommended to me. And man, did I enjoy it. I love spicy food, and the Original G is mock chicken with spicy buffalo sauce, lettuce, tomato, and vegan mayo. IT IS SO GOOD (and clears your sinuses out!). The thyme fries are absolutely awesome, as well. I could eat them all day.  The crab puffs are also so yummy, and completely different from what I expected! The puff itself is crunchy and flaky and delicious, and the mock crab is warm and creamy and so good. But above all, the shining part of the dish? The sauce they serve it with. SO GOOD.   Overall, I am so glad I gave Green a second chance. My advice? Go for the mock meat sandwiches. The bowls are ok, but the sandwiches are where Green truly shines.

It really is as good as it gets at Spinato's. I'm originally from Chicago and have never had any luck finding good Chicago-style thin crust ANYWHERE in the valley. My boyfriend picked up Spinato's on a whim a week or so ago and I had to keep myself from eating the entire pie!  The sauce is amazing - completely full of flavor. The crust is thin and flaky on the edges, and they cut their slices in SQUARES - my favorite. We just got the cheese for our first time, because if a place has good CHEESE pizza, all of the rest of their pizza will be good.  This is the best Chicago style pizza in Arizona. Absolutely delicious!

I'll start by saying I've been going to the Yard House for nearly a decade now. When I lived in North Scottsdale, we'd trek over to the Desert Ridge location, but now I just make sure I have lunch at the Fashion Square location anytime I'm spending a day at the mall. I love their Gardein meat substitute menu - when I first found out about it, I was *so* excited and it's never let me down!  A few days ago, one of my best girlfriends and I had lunch there and I ordered the Gardein BBQ Chicken Salad, my favorite. The food came out super quick, but I noticed my food was definitely incorrect - there were noodles and the smell of soy sauce and sesame oil. I asked our server if maybe the order had come in wrong, that this looked (and smelled) like the asian pasta salad. He apologized, quickly took it back and came back to let me know that the order had somehow gotten lost in translation. No big deal! He was very apologetic and told me my correct salad would be out shortly. I said ok, no worries! A few moments later, their head chef came out and apologized and let me know that, because of the mess up, they would be taking care of my lunch for me. I was shocked, in a really great way. I hadn't made a scene by any means (I've worked customer service for 9+ years, I know mistakes get made and who cares? I was enjoying a leisurely lunch anyway), but they really had amazing customer service and I was so thankful for their genuine level of caring about the mistake made, even though I wasn't upset at all! My salad came a few minutes after that, while my girlfriend was still only halfway through her meal! No harm, no foul.   Basically what I'm saying is, for amazing customer service, awesome beers, and tons of options, Yard House is tops. I always *have* recommended it, and now, after that amazing and unexpected experience, I will always continue to do so.

Only place I'll ever get pierced. Got my septum done by Dana awhile back. The place is completely clean, reasonably priced, and just great overall. Dana was funny and made me feel completely comfortable. I love HTC!

Great location, terrible customer service. I know Forever21 isn't really known much for their customer service, but the associate I asked for very minimal help (to help me find two pairs of shorts I was trying to exchange) was incredibly rude about it.   I had asked another associate (at the register) if I could get some help finding them. She asked an associate who had walked up to the register. She rolled her eyes and walked over to me. When I asked her where the shorts was, she told me they were "uh, right there" on a rack next to me .... where they weren't. While I asked her about another pair, she looked incredibly impatient and annoyed that I had asked her another question.   I have been working in customer service (both fashion and other types of retail) for six years. Again, I know customer service isn't #1 in Forever21's list of importance in their stores, but I don't think it's necessary to be impatient and rude when a customer asks for two quick questions.   I have had great experiences with customer service at the Scottsdale Fashion Square location, as well as a better selection (even though it's a smaller store). The associates there are always helpful and friendly.

I can't count how many times I've been to Sauce and I've never ever been disappointed.   I really enjoy Sauce for a lot of reasons, but especially because they have more than one vegetarian option. Nearly half of their menu is vegetarian and on the non-vegetarian items, meat can easily be omitted from the dish without changing it too much.  EAT. THE. MACARONI. AND. CHEESE. If you eat meat, get it with chicken and broccoli. If you don't eat meat, stick with the broccoli. Holy moly. It is the best macaroni and cheese I've ever tasted.   The vegetable and caprese salads are my favorites; they're both really fresh and I love the dressings.  Now, I hesitate to call their pizza PIZZA. I'm from Chicago. I know real, good pizza. Sauce isn't classic pizza, and anyone who is heading into there thinking it is WILL be disappointed. Now, if you're looking for a new, fresher spin on a pie, then Sauce is your place.  I've eaten every kind of pizza Sauce has to offer (I said I've been there quite a bit!), but my favorites are:  Prosciutto and melon (damn my vegetarianism, I can't eat it any more!) - super fresh tasting; great salty/sweet. If you get it to go, ask them to pack the prosciutto and melon separately (as well as separately from the pizza). If not, you'll regret it - the pizza is a soggy mess otherwise.  Wild mushroom and truffled arugula - my tried and true favorite. To me, it's the one that tastes most like "classic pizza."  When my boyfriend and I went there a few days ago, though, he wanted to try something new; we tried the Rosemary Potato (with spinach, feta, and olive tapenade).  It was delicious. It was pretty greasy in comparison to their other pizzas, but still really tasty! The feta was awesome, as well.

The Rock - I love you. The bartenders and cocktail servers are so sweet and friendly and the drink prices are AMAZING ($3.50 long island iced teas? Yes please!). They treated us so wonderfully for my sister's bachelorette party - we went and saw the Barbra Seville show with Celia Putty, Diva, and more! We had the best time. I love the Rock and definitely plan on coming back - especially for the amazing drag shows!

Big letdown. My husband and I came here with friends a few years back, and the food was mediocre at best. I didn't write my review then but it would've probably been a 3 star review, maximum.  Last month, we originally planned on going over to Central Bistro for brunch but it was Labor Day and they were closed. We called Over Easy and they were open, with little to no wait! We drove over and they had a "Please Seat Yourselves" sign at the front. There was another group of two waiting ahead of us. It took about ten minutes before we got seated, which was fine. We had a chance to figure out what we wanted to eat so when our server came by, we were ready to order. I ordered a breakfast burrito (potato, egg, cheese and some veggies) and my husband ordered a malted waffle. During the 45 minutes we waited for our food, we saw someone send back their food twice, another group waiting for their food (when it did end up coming, only half of their food came) for as long as us, and little to no food coming out of the kitchen. The busser was working his tail off and you could tell the servers were super busy, but we still waited almost an entire hour for a burrito and a waffle. Our server popped by twice to tell us our food was almost out but we still waited 10-15 minutes after it. She did thank us for our patience, which I appreciated, but if I hadn't been so hungry I would not have waited that long.  When our food finally came, my husband's waffle was ice cold. My burrito was obviously microwaved (the tortilla was hot and the eggs were steamy and almost watery) and was missing the potatoes. Our server asked us how everything was and we did let her know the waffle was cold - she offered to reheat it for us but again, we were starving and just wanted to eat.  I know this place has been on Diners, Drive Ins & Dives and usually those places are pretty delicious. I don't know if it's just gone downhill in the past few years, but with all the awesome brunch options out in our neighborhood (with more opening up) like Postino, Central Bistro, and Snooze, we won't be back to Over Easy.

The food. Was. AWESOME.   I've been a vegetarian for a year, my boyfriend for over two years. After shopping at the Scottsdale Quarter H&M with my meat-eating best friend, we were absolutely famished. Because the food in that area is way too expensive for my pockets, my best friend recommended Fresh Mint to us. Because it was lunch time, we were able to get the lunch "to go" menu, which saved us a few bucks each.   We all shared the Autumn roll, which was delicious but definitely not enough food for how much it cost.  My best friend got the Mongolian Soy Beef - it was fabulous! I absolutely hate most soy beefs and, while the taste wasn't perfect, the texture sure was!   My boyfriend got the tofu curry - I am not a curry fan, so I didn't try it, but he loved it.  I got the kung pow soy chicken and dang, I was surprised. There was a perfect amount of food - not way too much; just enough. The consistency of the chicken was almost perfect (strings and all!), and the sauce was delicious. There were tons of veggies and the salad that came with it was awesome and light and fresh.  The owners are so sweet and friendly. I truly enjoyed eating there.  Oh, and one more thing - the BEST Arnold Palmer I've ever had! Fresh lemonade and fresh iced tea - deeelicious!

Ohhhh mama. Just thinking about Woodlands makes my mouth water. I know everything my boyfriend has ever had there he has loved. He tries out new things every time there.   I, on the other hand, just stick to what I know and love and crave: the vegetable manchurian. It's spicy, delicious, deep fried vegetables with a nice cold dipping sauce on the side. The price is great for the awesome amount of food you get (one order is usually two dinners for me, sometimes more!). Ambience is lacking, but we tend to take our food to go. I just wish they'd open a location closer to Tempe!

The food? Absolutely amazing.  And that's where it ends.  As a vegetarian, I am always looking for new places to eat. I work near Chakra and a co-worker and I decided to head over there on our (hour) lunch break. We walked in and saw a sign that said "please wait to be greeted!" so... we did. For almost ten minutes. A few employees glanced at us and didn't say anything. Finally, an employee told us we could "sit anywhere we wanted" - why did we need to wait to be greeted, then? Oh well.   The food isn't cheap. A tea and the Nutty Raw-vacado ran me nearly 20 bucks with tip. Our server was all right, but it took ten minutes just to get her over to get our drink orders. Another 25-30 minutes passed (we were looking at around 1:45 and we had to be back to work by 2PM) and our food was finally out.  And it was REALLY good. The plate was overflowing with greens and my sandwich was delicious. We stuffed our faces pretty quickly - I didn't get to enjoy my food half as much as I would've liked! My co-worker mentioned that last time he had eaten at Chakra, he had ended up having a nearly 2-hour lunch because of the slow service.   I hate to say it, but, for almost all raw food, what the heck is taking so long in the kitchen?  As delicious as the food was, I have to say - I probably won't be back to Chakra.

I waffled between 4 and 5 stars, but the 5 won! Here we go:  I made a reservation for a large party about a week before the date for our meal. When my best friend got to Gallo Blanco, the hostess said my reservation was nowhere to be found. On a Saturday. With a reservation for 9 people. YIKES. To put it lightly, I was pretty upset. The restaurant was packed and I was HUNGRY. I specifically had made the reservation so far in advance, had spoken with the person on the phone for quite a few minutes, where she got my name, phone number, we repeated the dates back to each other, etc. Needless to say, I was bothered. This wasn't the first time this had happened to me recently (but it was at another restaurant) and it just kind of bummed me out.  We ended up waiting 25 minutes for our table, which was frustrating. But luckily, one of the staff came over a few times to let me know that they were working on it and wanted to make sure my birthday dinner went as fabulously as possible, which I definitely appreciated. When we finally got seated, our server, Henry, was outstanding! He immediately got right in the game and got my appetizer orders (queso with veggies and guacamole, YUM) and came back for drink orders a minute or so later. He had great knowledge of the menu and our food came out quick, hot, and DELICIOUS.   I tried one of my fiance's veggie tacos and it was soo yummy. I had the Ensalada Cortada and loved it. The AZ Margarita was so delicious I had to have two! One of my girlfriends ordered the elote which was the best I've had, and everyone else loved their shrimp tacos, tostadas, and carne asada tacos.   But what really set them above the rest and made me want to write this review was that, as an apology for the lost reservation, they gave us some complimentary desserts. We ended up getting the orange cake, the lime tart (not on the menu, but recommended to us by our server), and the flan. Holy moly. All of the desserts were beyond delicious. I wished I hadn't eaten so much beforehand because I wanted to devour the leftover desserts!  What could have been a bad situation ended up being wonderful. Gallo Blanco really took care of us and I will DEFINITELY be back!

The prices may be high; but Smeeks is the best candy shop in the valley. It is absolutely adorable inside. They have an awesome, albeit small selection of sodas right next to the door, from orange to grape to a mid-west, childhood staple - Green River. They have all kinds of candy - retro stuff, vegan treats, taffy, bubblegum, 10 and 25 cent treats, as well as their own bagged gummy and chocolate candies.   They also have some of my favorite novelty items, always good for gifts - like World Wide Fred kitchen supplies, extra large moustaches, and magnets and key-toppers galore. There is always something you can find at Smeeks.   One of my favorite parts is their photobooth. It IS digital, but the photos don't come out pixelated - in fact, they look pretty similar to film photobooths. Smeeks even has a basket full of hats, glasses, and other props to truly enhance your photobooth-ing experience! The price is $5 for two sets (and two copies per set)! It's a really, really good deal on photobooth pictures - at the state fair, one copy of one set was $5!  My question to others who've said they found a better candy shop is - where?! I haven't seen a cuter, more unique candy shop in Arizona - ever!

Absolutely superb.   My boyfriend made reservations about a week ago for my birthday dinner last night at FnB. They called him earlier in the day yesterday (Friday) to confirm, which I absolutely love.   We arrived 15 minutes early but were seated immediately by Pavle. He pulled out my chair for me, called me all different terms of endearment, was incredibly attentive, etc etc.   When my boyfriend asked if they had lemonade, Pavle said "no, but I have simple syrup and lime juice in the back. How about a limeade?" It seems silly, but that was such a great touch. Also, the limeade was awesome!  We ordered the moz/leeks/egg dish and oh, wow. The leeks were cooked perfectly, the bread crumbs added the perfect crunch, and the egg mixed with the delicious, warm, gooey mozzarella was the perfect mixture of tastes and texture. Wow.   We also ordered the grilled spicy broccoli with pistachios. Perfect amount of spiciness - not so bland that you're questioning where the heat went, but not so spicy to where your mouth is on fire for minutes afterward. The broccoli was thick and cooked perfectly - grilled and still crisp.   Both my boyfriend and I are vegetarians and were told that we could order a specially made plate. Because we were so full from the two appetizers, we split a vegetarian entree.  And again ... wow. We were given a plate overflowing with food. It was a trio of dishes - broccoli with (we think) cumin rice and a tomato garnish/sauce, potatoes with pea pods and (I believe...) spinach, and beans with spinach, and an array of green leafies. Each bite was more delicious than the one prior. We hardly talked as we devoured the food. So good, so tasty - everything was seasoned perfectly and perfectly cooked.   I was so excited to have a vegetarian dish that wasn't just pasta with a vegetable thrown in. It is so nice to have an innovative vegetarian dish that truly felt like it was made creatively. Pavle told us he truly appreciated the assessment of the vegetarian food, and we let him know how absolutely wonderful it was.  He also let us know they have a vegetarian tasting menu once every few months, which trust me, we'll be going to.   Overall, one of the best dining experiences I've had in a very long time. We truly felt like we weren't burdening the (amazing) staff with any requests or questions. They were all so friendly and attentive.   We will definitely be back to FnB.

Zinburger's veggie burger has officially beaten my previous favorite (The Vig). It is SO GOOD. I love that I can get any of their burgers with the veggie patty - so far, the buffalo chicken burger with veggie patty is my absolute favorite combination. My husband has really enjoyed everything he's gotten as well, and their french fries are soo delicious.  The service is always awesome, the food is always stellar, and the milkshakes are amazing! Zinburger has quickly become one of our favorite spots!

After sampling Lee's Cream Liqueur at Yelp events, my boyfriend and I decided to try Lee's out in full-size. After dinner at FnB, we made the (incredibly short, two shop) walk to Lee's. First off, the place is adorable. Super small, but not cramped. Pink walls with a really fun mirrored wall - it has a very retro-modern look to it. I tried the gummy bear tequila - super good, but I wanted something chocolate-y. I chose the Mudslide Peppermint Shnapps. It was delicious! There was a tiny hint of alcohol to it most of the way through, though some bites were much more full of the taste than others. My boyfriend got the Apple Ala Mode / Rum and it was super tasty, as well. The ice cream scoopers were really sweet and helpful - I loved that they greeted everyone with their motto about every hour being happy hour. I sure left happy!

Saw Bree Lin for my first tattoo ever and she was amazing. We had a great time chatting and she made me feel so comfortable. The shop is intimate and small and all of the artists are so friendly. Morgan happened to be there tattooing while I was getting tattooed, and she was so sweet and chatted with us as well. I cannot say enough positive things about Golden Rule - it was truly the best first tattoo experience I could ever have. I even started planning out my next one (or two or three) while Bree was tattooing me!   I absolutely LOVE my tattoo. She totally understood what I wanted, and captured the personality of my sweet dog perfectly! Golden Rule is definitely my go-to tattoo shop, and I can't wait to get more work done by Bree Lin!

Awesome. Just... awesome. My boyfriend and I went here last night and fell in love. There are four steps to sub zero ice cream - choose your size, choose your base (premium ice cream, custard, yogurt, or soy), choose your flavors (as many as you want!), and choose your mix ins (one included). We were really excited to see soy on the menu, because most ice cream places don't really cater to the lactose intolerant or vegan.  I ordered the a small cake batter and mint yogurt with chocolate chips. The ice cream slinger poured liquid yogurt into the bowl, then squirted flavor in there, as well as the chocolate chips. Then, she sent it over to another ice cream maker, who put it under liquid nitrogen. The whole counter erupts into a mass of billowing fog. The kids who were in the shop were entranced, and I'm not going to lie - I kind of was too! The small was more than I could eat - soo much frozen yogurt! And it was absolutely amazing. It was the coldest frozen yogurt I've ever eaten, but it was never freezer burned. It still retained its' creaminess.  My boyfriend got a small premium ice cream with dutch honey and maple flavors, mixed in with walnuts and brownies mixed in. WOW. It was delicious.    It is a great place for kids, and the ice cream is amazing. There are also more choices here than I've ever seen at any ice cream place, from the mix ins to the flavors to the bases. The people working were also great and customer service is key!

VEGETARIANS! EAT HERE!   I've been a vegetarian for nearly 3 years, and the one thing I miss more than anything is a delicious deli sandwich. Capriotti's has filled that void oh so deliciously well. The vegetarian Philly Cheesesteak is delicious. The Veggie Cole Turkey with Russian dressing is killer. They use Morningstar Farms chicken and Worthington's Turkey - it is the best mock turkey I've ever eaten - and you can't buy Worthington's in AZ, so you've got to try it at Capriotti's!  My only annoyance was that I can't get a Vegetarian Bobby. The stuffing has chicken stock in it. What a bummer. You'd think, as veg friendly as they are, that the stuffing would be vegetarian too. Oh well. I'll stick with my Veggie Cole Turkey anyday.

Since moving to the area last year, I've had Central Bistro on my Yelp bookmarks. For some reason, we hadn't made it over until a few weekends ago. My husband, his parents, and I headed over there for Sunday brunch. We had a reservation for noon and were seated almost immediately.  We were told they had fresh doughnuts (espresso with coffee glaze) and ordered some. Holy moly, they were warm and delicious! I ordered the naked pancake (one of the best pancakes I've ever had - and holy moly, they were HUGE and I got three of them! I could only eat one!) , my husband got the club sandwich (which he loved), my father in law got the Cuban sandwich (it was a big hit), and my mother in law got a really delicious superfood salad. Food was seriously awesome, and definitely filling.  The servers are dressed so adorably - their "uniforms" fit the gorgeous restaurant perfectly. It was a super comfortable atmosphere. One of the coolest/most unique things is the underside of their tables are lined with carpeting! I know this may seem like not a big deal, but I can't tell you how many times I've worn tights or leggings to a restaurant and had them snagged by the underside of a wooden table. So that was definitely a nice touch.  Here's my only gripe: there were musicians playing fairly loudly almost the whole time we were eating. I know some people enjoy live music while eating, but I go out to eat to visit with friends and family. My father in law was sitting closest to the musicians (who were definitely super talented) and I had to basically talk into his ear for him to hear me. In the future, I'll definitely request outdoor seating for brunch (or near the bar) so the music isn't so loud.  Overall, wonderful experience. We will definitely be back - for brunch, lunch, and to try dinner!

I cannot say enough amazing things about Nook. My husband and I have been here at least four times now and each time is exceptional. We live within walking distance (which is both great and dangerous) and Nook is part of the reason we want to stay in this area!  Pizza is always awesome. Appetizers are SO GOOD (we went a week or so ago with my family and had the arancini and the artichoke special - we basically licked the plates clean!). Drinks are amazing - especially the specialty Mules. My favorite was the white pear, but each one has been awesome.  We got my brother in law hooked on the Pasta Crepe - and the four pepper cream sauce it comes with is one of the best things I've ever tasted.   Desserts are always amazing and unique and service is always great, too. And they take reservations, which we love. All in all, Nook is one of our favorite places in Phoenix!

The Clever Koi is it. The true 5 star restaurant. My husband and I have been here twice and we both agree it is truly our favorite restaurant in the Valley.  Location is awesome. While parking is not the best (most spaces are "reserved" for George and Dragon patrons only), we always have managed to find a spot fairly easily. If not, they always have valet available.   Ambiance is fantastic. Love how it's decorated, the interior design and lighting are great.  Service? Some of the best I've ever experienced. David has been our server both times and I cannot say enough wonderful things about him. He's so friendly, attentive, and incredibly knowledgeable about not only the food menu, but the drinks as well. He can explain every single ingredient of the drink menu to you, from chartreuse to Pimm's to anything else you may not know. If I've had a sweeter, more genuine server, I cannot remember when it was. He remembered us from our first foray in and made sure to say goodnight to us as we left (and let us know the new menu would be coming out soon, yes!). The general manager (who has been there both times we have) is always super friendly as well, running food and always making sure everyone's happy. The bussers are great too (waters were always kept full) and the place runs like a well oiled machine.  Drinks were awesome. My husband ordered one that ended up being fairly strong, so David came by and did a few revisions to it, making it absolutely delicious. I had the Temperance Trap (awesome), one of my girlfriends had the Paloma (also awesome), and another friend had the homemade Green Apple soda (a special for the night), which he loved.  Okay, so now onto the food.  Ohhhh, the food.  Blue Lake Green Beans. Every person at the table said the same thing (both times): "how can you make green beans taste THIS good?" Answer from David: the woodfire grill, of course. Apparently in the winter there are brussel sprouts instead of green beans, so I can't wait for it to get chilly again!  Things I didn't eat but was told were amazing: the chicken and waffles and  pork belly steamed buns, pork ramen, chicken ramen, and chicken chow mein. All six of us last night were "mmmm"ing through the meal.   Both times, I've ordered the vegetable chow mein with tofu. So. So. So good. The tofu is cooked on the woodfire grill, the vegetables (especially the mushrooms) are marinated in some blend of spices that are so delicious that one of my fellow diners had to try some out of another's bowl.   For dessert... well, we went a bit dessert crazy. David let us know there were a few new desserts: a chocolate pudding with a cashew nougat and a citrus soft serve, in addition to the bananas foster fritters. It was my husband's birthday so we thought "what the hell" and ordered all three. And I am so glad we did, because they were all delicious.   Throughout the meal David came by to ask us how everything was, to chit chat with us and make sure we knew he was available. We absolutely loved talking with him and appreciated so much that we knew he wasn't too busy for us (even though he was definitely busy!).   I can't say enough good things about Clever Koi. Now I can't wait for the new menu to come out, so we have another excuse to go visit!
