This venue is definitely SMALL which I personally love since every seat is better.  I came here last night for the Arena Football League championship game between the AZ Rattlers and the Utah Blaze for a place in the Arena Bowl.  Maybe it was the fact that the family friendly dedicated fans are amazing, or the fact that it's arena football (which I've never been to), but I felt that this venue is expertly managed.  The music at the game was great, they kept the energy going all night long, and the decor of the arena speaks to the neighborhood friendly arena.  It may not be as big and sparkly as several other venues, but it's one that's right up my alley.  Plus, traffic coming out is worlds better than Staples Center in LA or Oracle Arena in Oakland.  I can't wait until I can come back here for a concert!

I'm writing this review purely as a seller.   So I am a total shopaholic!  I guess that's what happens when you work in the industry.  Anyways, I cleaned out my closet and came here and they literally took 1 pair of jeans out of maybe 40-50 items.  I mostly brought in some old work clothes from Banana Republic and just some odds and ends that no longer fit.  This place is solely for indy/punky/trendy, which they do make quite clear so they are what they say they are which is good.  Makes me kind of wonder how many people buy and sell back the same items though...

The capital grille never fails!  The lobster and crab stuffed shrimp is absolutely amazing and the parmesan truffle fries are to die for!  The service is always top notch and they are on top of refills.  The valet out front is awesome and of course the overall atmosphere is great.

I decided to book an appt here after reading all these great reviews on yelp!  I saw that a lot of salons are closed on Sundays so it's definitely a plus that they are open.  They had an opening with Laura so off I went!  I was definitely pleasantly surprised.  The staff was friendly and Laura did a great job asking questions.  I'm one of those "do whatever you want" type of people BUT I have a lot of hair and it's a weird Asian wavy.  You can't really cut it too short or it puffs out and I am super lazy and rarely style.  Yes, I know... I expect to wake up look great and go.  The cut- All I kept thinking was "omg, she's cutting too much off.. Omg more layering... Omg more razoring.. Omg this is going to be a disaster."    Thank goodness it wasn't!  Like I said, I was very pleasantly surprised!  I had wanted something a little different and she succeeded with flying colors.  Loving it!

As a beginner, I'm definitely a fan of all the par 3's and the casualness of the course.  I got paired up with another twosome and they were awesome people who were just out to have a great time and enjoy a little friendly competition amongst themselves.  The course is well kept and reasonably priced.  I'd definitely come back!

This is the shittiest hotel ever!!! Someone put mustard on my boyfriend's car in the Excalibur parking structure and when we got back to car, it had already solidified. For those of you who don't know any better, mustard is acidic and will destroy a paint job... Especially in 100 degree plus weather. We spent an hour washing it off and when we finally did, the black mustang is now green where the mustard was. The car now needs to be completely repainted. We spent an hour reporting it to Excalibur security, and of course Excalibur was unwilling to do a thing about the vandalism which occurred on their property.  Furthermore, we had decided to spend an extra night since we didn't want to finish our vacation on such a sour note so we booked the room for another night.  They weren't even willing to give us the same rate which we had booked it for online.  Excalibur has the worst customer service out of all of the hotels on the strip, not to mention they have salespeople at every entrance trying to draw you in.  Finally, I witnessed a maid take clean towels from her cart, throw them on the floor by the door, and then hang them up as clean towels.  HORRIBLE!!!    I would give this place ZERO stars if I could.

If you're up for hiking, Camelback is a MUST!  Both the Echo Canyon and the Cholla trail are difficult in their own ways.  Both trails are a little hard to follow as there are parts that aren't clearly marked or there's literally some climbing to be done before reaching the next marker.  Expect to climb stairs, slippery parts, and rocks.  Beware of lizards!!  Great view from the top!  Climb Cholla trail for a view of a golf course on the easy first half up with a more challenging second half.  Climb the Echo Canyon side for a pretty consistent and steeper climb.  Also, beware of cops on your way to the trailheads.

How have I not yet written a review for one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix?!?  Ok, I think it's because I've had one bad experience here out of about 10 but overall I love Chelsea.  I love the atmosphere of this place and how you can have a romantic dinner inside, sit at the bar area for something more casual, or sit outside and enjoy the weather with some nice lighting in the trees.  The bar is half on the inside and half on the outside so you really do have several seating options.  The service staff is consistently phenomenal (with the one exception but the manager actually did a nice job handling that situation).  One time we were outside and it started sprinkling.  As soon as I asked to switch tables, they quickly accommodated us even though there was a wait and we were still on appetizers.  Now that is service!  The food- I LOVE the menu.  I always want to order everything off the menu and everything I've had has been exceptional.  The deviled eggs are my guilty pleasure along with the tartare.  I usually end up going with the short ribs for dinner but the fish is great as well.  The short ribs have always been melt in your mouth tender and I've never heard a complaint about anything amongst all the company I've brought here.  Plus, it helps that I moved out of. Phoenix, came back to visit, and saw a "goodnight Emily" drink special on the menu.  Who doesn't love to see a special named after them??  The drink was pretty darn good too, not that I'm biased or anything.  Don't believe me?  Try it for yourself!

I came here for an early dinner by myself monday on a work trip.  I always find it telling when the hostess won't seat you at a table despite the place being empty.  I was fine sitting in the bar area but had to ask for a menu etc.  The service wasn't great and the food was average.  They do have really good complimentary bread that you have to request as it's never offered.  The Mac n cheese is a delicious side and the sirloin was pretty average.  The menu looks like there is a decent happy hour with some salivating apps listed at $9 vs the regular prices of 15-20.  I also thought it was strange that the waitress asked for my name and id, not the room number that I wanted to charge the meal to.  I felt uncomfortable with the service and hence 2 stars- 1 for service, 3.5 for food, and pretty average on overall feel and atmosphere for a nice steakhouse on the strip.  I'd recommended going elsewhere.

I LOVE this place!  I usually avoid any restaurants that have gluten free or veggie friendly menus since I'm as true as a carnivore as you can get.  However, this place has absolutely amazing food, service, and drinks.  It's a relaxing atmosphere with fresh, healthy food that doesn't sacrifice flavor or appetite.  Both alcoholic drinks and nonalcoholic drinks are equally superb!

This place is too freaking cute!!!  The OJ is literally one of the best glasses I've ever had.  I had the typical eggs, bacon, and toast and it was amazing.  The bacon was crispy without being burnt, the toast had just the right level of buttery goodness and the eggs were folded such as a crepe and fluffy goodness.  I also tried a bite of the pulled pork burger which was amazing, and the touch of apple put it over the top.  Another plus was the garden patio area that feels homey like someones backyard.  I will definitely be back to this cozy establishment!

Delicious!!!!  You can't ever go wrong with this place!!!  Whether it's a late night snack or a lunch, you always leave satisfied with a happy tummy.  The lines are a bit confusing as there are three separate ones depending on what you're ordering.  The spicy pork and the asada are the obvious staples although they offer tongue and other stranger meats I don't have the balls to try.  So staples it is!  The tacos are the perfect size and usually 2-3 at 2 bucks a pop will do the trick.  I recommend getting into the shorter line of the two since you can still place one order. To receive both.  They have a nice selection or horchata and plenty of seating inside and out.  The locals obviously love the place as well and I constantly see construction workers pick up huge orders for their crews.  If you're staying at the Wynn or the encore, there is NO excuse not to try this place!

BEST HARD WAX place ever!!  If you've never tried hard wax, you should definitely give it a shot!  They have the most amazing blue wax  that barely hurts.  I come here for Brazilians and the clean venue.  The place always smells great and they give you a free thong after every visit!  They are very sanitary and don't double dip.  Seriously, amazing blue hard wax.

Absolutely love this place.  The service is top notch- newspaper when you arrive, recommendation of which row is open, a lil reminder note, cold water when you leave, and coupons!  The spot club is awesome so definitely join and leave the card in your car or just type in your receipt info at home after you sign up online.  The drivers, cashiers, are all the friendliest.  Finally, remember there's two now so get on the right bus!

Tom, Tom, Tom- I'm the biggest fan of craft in LA and I was tempted to go to craftsteak but I thought if try this new addition to the family.  I love the ambiance of the restaurant and the decor with all the wood.  How fitting for the theme of it all with the natural ingredients and way of cooking.  The service was superb as to be expected.  We started with the beef tartare and I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious it was and the nice pairing with mushrooms and veggies.  It only comes with two pieces of bread which if didn't think was enough to distribute evenly while allowing you to savor the actual appetizer.  You could always use the complimentary bread but it's just never the same.  I had the Kobe beef and WOW, I'm speechless... Cutting it was like slicing butter and the beef just burst with tenderness and juicy goodness.  I had one of the specialty cocktails with strawberry and it ended up being very disappointing.  The waiter noticed I barely drank it and went ahead and took it off the bill which was super sweet!  Overall, awesome, not as good as craft but still holds it own!

Half hour ride over Vegas with a presumably improved experience with the happy hour bar special.  Those with a fear of heights won't even notice as the capsule  is pretty spacious (30 people) and even has some seating.  It moves very slowly and the movement felt is minimal overall.   Getting on and off feels like the haunted mansion ride at Disney as a plus!  It is definitely a little on the pricey end as I believe the London eye is on only a little more than half the price.  Overall, nice experience to try once and indulge, but you can still get killer views in the great hotel rooms.

Joe is flipping hilarious!!!  He is the best waiter I've had in FOREVER.  Quick wit and great humor to keep is laughing for days and super helpful with the menu.  He even suggested half and half orders when we couldn't decide! Awesome decor throughout with bright colors and a nice patio.  Love the orange.  We had passed by on several mornings and it's literally always crowded for good reason.  The pancakes are a must have with all the fluffy goodness to indulge in.  They are pretty big portions so if you're not completely in the mood, a wise choice would be to get an order to share if you can.  Chiles verdes and chilaquiles were also yummy with the most amazing sauce.  Price point is perfect for the quality of food and exceptional service.  My only wish is to go back and try a mimosa!
