I love this TJ's. Staff is awesome and always greets you with a smile. They all take pride in their food and have some great suggestions for recipes. It's also convenient as it's a great place to grab some food after my workouts since la fitness is right next door!

It's hard to find New York style pizza in AZ. Usually when establishments claim New York style, the slice is no bigger than a slice from papa johns! Not at rays! My fiancé and I are from New York and we were pleased to find this gem. The guys are pretty much straight from BK and are rather entertaining. Great spot! And food is affordable! And apparently you can enjoy a glass of wine for 3.50. Doesn't get much sweeter than that!

Great food for a decent price! Their garlic chicken wings are superb. I will definitely say it's a hole in the wall. Nevertheless, I'll  sacrifice ambiance and great service for yummy Chinese. It's hard finding decent Chinese food in Phoenix. This here is one of them!

I've been on and off with Iron Gloves since college. They are an AWESOME gym!!! Joe and Renene are amazing. They do their very best to know everyone on a personal level. The hardest workouts I have endured has been at IronGloves. 30 minute one on one sessions feeks like an eternity.. Because of IronGloves, I have appreciated the sport of Boxing, and thanks to them, it has become one of my passions. Due to my crazy work/study schedule and change of location, I havent had the chance to go recently, but I plan on going back soon. Right when I think I am in the best shape possible, I leave it to Joe to give me a reality check! Everytime I hit the bags I can hear Joe chant "JAAAAB.. ONE, TWO!!" LOL gotta love it!

Great wings and great service. The owner made it a point to get to to know us! I like to think of myself as a wing connoisseur.. And boy did they do a job well done! You not only have the option of wing flavor, but you can choose how they cook it.. *insert bubba gump voice * fried wings, deep fried wings, sautéed wings, grilled wings, glazed wings etc ..  And you get beat their drink specials! Premium liquor drinks for amazing prices! Can't find a better place to enjoy drinks, football, and the wings!

It's not often that you find a nail salon the provides consistent great results! This is my go to nail salon. My gel manis are amazing and the staff is great. The price is a few dollars more, but it's totally worth it! It gets really packed so I recommend making an appointment. They do a great job on eyebrow waxing as well!

One of scottsdale's many hidden gems. Burgers are amazing! We had a classic cheese burger and their chili cheese burger. Needless to stay, we left with our taste buds bursting and bellies full! Highly recommended!

It saddens me to leave such a harsh review but here we go!  Ill start off with the good. The concept of top golf is awesome! Glowing golf driving range over drinks ... Who wouldn't want to go?   Nevertheless, the staff was trained poorly. We were told it would be an hour wait (which was fine since it was a busy night). In the meantime we thought to grab a bite to eat and some drinks. We go to the bar upstairs, as directed, and were not acknowledged once by the bartender. I gave the benefit of the doubt being that it was a busy night. We go downstairs and before sitting, I ask the bartender if it's okay to order food at the bar as well. She gladly agreed. After 15 or so she comes to take our order but claims she is only taking our drinks order at this time. I politely decline as I stated originally that I'm here to order some food. She didn't seem too happy but it could've been due to the fact that the bar got busy in a matter of minutes.   Now it's time for us to go to our bay. I ask the guy at concierge for clubs because I am left handed and they don't normally have left handed clubs out. He provides a smart a** comment saying "have you really been here before?" Ummm yes I have but again I'm left handed so I need some clubs suitable for me .. He didn't realize that's why I asked and seemed embarrassed after   Finally it's time to golf! Our waitress upstairs was soo friendly. However they forgot to add the shots in our drink order. They brought over shots to stir in our drinks but She wasn't sure which shot had which so she  proceeded to smell the glass. A nose in a drink is not what i would prefer for a cocktail. I can't stress enough .. Top golf can be a great place for a fun night but I highly recommend more training for staff

Great food! The arroz con pato was amazing! And the drinks were awesome! First time ever trying bacon concerned dates and I was impressed. The decor is gorgeous and staff is nice. Great place to go with friends on a Friday night!

Found my new nail spot. These ladies take their time to provide top of the line service. Gel mani and pedi have lasted for 2 weeks. Jenny hooked it up with the eye brow wax! She was a perfectionist, which I love. I'm so excited to go back on Friday. Can't beat fruit slices with your pedicure!
