I just finished their ducelle burger special. Oh man was it delicious. There was a hint of wasabi that really made the burger outstanding. I love how fez puts the right mix of interesting ingrediants in to their burgers. Really is so unique. Can't wait to try another one of their specialty burgers. And our server Lauren was so sweet. Thanks fez!

I'm a huge fan of matts. Have been for 2 years now. Their service is great, but more importantly their food is amazing. Always order teh home fries. My favorites are the hog and chick and the big butter burger. The only slight downfall is the wait, if it looks like there are 25 people in front of you on the list, it might be best to just go another time.  Unless you're willing to wait more than two hours.

I've only had one dish there, the #3 breakfast which had a yummy mixture of potatos, peppers, egg and toast. It was great and a large portion. The toast was especially great. I ended up bringing the rest home for dinner too. The waitress I had last time was a probably new to waitressing because she kept forgetting things, but the food more than made up for it. Going there again this weekend, maybe Ill try something new! The place is cute and very comfortable. You really can sit outside with all the umbrellas and shaded spaces.

The first few times I went there it was ok, good portions and decent service. I usually order the #3 ( have had it 3 times already) So I decided to bring a big group of friends to eat there to share in its awesomenss. Big mistake. Service was poor. The waitress never came to check on us after giving us our food and they completely screwed up my order. I even called ahead of time to make sure they could cook the #3 plate, they said yes. When it came out it was 1/3 the size it usually was, and didn't have any of the peppers or bacon that it's supposed to come with. It was literally a few pieces of potatos with 2 eggs on top for $9. Everyone else was not really impressed either.

Hayes is amazing. I'm not a coffee drinker, but I do love the smell of coffee and you can smell Hayes' coffee from around the block. Just follow your nose and you'll find his cute shop. I always get the jasmine green tea, really unique and tasty! I love going into Royal because the staff there always make me feel welcome and treat me like a regular, even though I only go every couple of months when I'm in the area. My sister who came to visit has fallen in LOVE with the Royal's cold brew coffee and I have since purchased 3 bags for her and sent them to her because she wont drink any other. That's gotta say something!

Amazing! I tried their sweet nutella crepe for the first time a few months ago and have been craving it ever since. Jeff and Erin are such incredible people. Their knowledge of food and crepes is beyond scary.  Gotta trust the guy who has a nutella tattoo right? And they're always coming out with new yummy items for their menu. I can't wait to try the rest of their menu!

I tried Yumberi for the first time last week and it was so yummy! (har har har). Anyways, my favorite was the cheesecake flavor with cheesecake toppings! Love it especially since it is eco-friendly with their biodegradable cups and spoonware. The staff there are kind and very welcoming. The furniture is insanely cute too! Definitely a great place to just hang out for an afternoon. I plan on going back soon, I heard on twitter they just got pistachio flavored yogurt, SCORE!

This was my first time at Viet Kitchen. I ordered a steak rice dish. Pretty disappointing. One scoop of rice, 7 pieces of chopped beef and 5 fries.   Seriously? Seriously? the steak was dry. the food was not even close to filling. and why the heck was there only 5 fries? Maybe I ordered the wrong thing?

I wasnt sold on Humble Pie the first time I came in, but im sold now. Their meatballs are delicious. Great lunch special and friendly folks. And I love the staff (love my two favorite servers Rizzo and Theron). They always crack me up. A great place to hang out and grab an iced tea.

I've been using Tina and AccountingProse for a while now. She sat down and made something that was clearly confusing and intimidating become something very easy to comprehend. She is patient and will make the whole payroll process super simple. She has taken a load off when it comes to those nitty gritty details of hiring new staff. Now I'm a pro. She gave me all the documents I needed to have my staff up and running with automated payments and handled all my 1099's like a pro.  I am super busy running around and do not have time to deal with handling all of these payroll details and feel so fortunate I have Tina fighting for me and making sure I am doing it all right.   She is quick and is great to work with! Highly recommend!!
