This is the OLD SCHOOL Deli of Phoenix.  My family has been going here since it has opened, my grandmother, my father, everyone.  We always ordered Beer Wurst Sandwitches with their famous Cheese Spread.  Try A dough boy, Try their Macaroni Salad.  You can't go wrong.  Yes, you do have to know what you want when you come in, this ain't friggin Subway, its a real DELI...

Quite simply, if you need it done, and done with flair, Impact is the place to go for your printing needs.  They are an Artesan print shop where quality always comes first and the focus is value.   If you appreciate quality and are willing to pay a fair price for it, then Impact is the place for you to go.

The folks here are the Cream of the Crop.  They do work on my Range Rover.  I had them change out my brembo brakes and they, not even the dealership figured out that the disks and pads need to be seated in prior to use.  The last brake change cycle I had to deal with screaming brakes for the entire time, and was told by Land Rover that this was probably normal for performance brakes.  My father Herb has been going here since I was knee high to a grasshopper and only trusts them to work on his Mercedes's.

I have been coming here with my family since it opened, years ago. The food is consistently good. All of their pasta dishes are excellent. If you like soups like the kind served in fine dining, they are known for their excellent soups of all kinds,  particularly their lentil vegetable, stratetella soup, and minestrone.  On rare occasions they have Osso Bucco roasted veal lamb shank. It is superb.  If you are unsure what to try first on the menu, be sure to order the Penne Bolognese.

Love the organ...  Sad to see this Arizona historical treasure in such danger of mediocrity due to poor management.  The pizza we had wasn't worth taking home.  I didn't want to insult the cardboard box by putting pizza in it that is more tasteless than  itself.  Fix yer food folks!!!

Joe and his crew are exceptional in every way.  They are not cheap, but they do quality work, and it shows.  If you demand quality work and enjoy dealing with quality folks, then these are the folks to turn to when the crapper backs up on ya.   My family has been using them for over a decade.  They do repairs and installation, residential and commercial, projects big and small.

If you have a fender bender and you need quality restoration body work that is done like the factory would, then go to the Artesan's at Select Auto Body.  Bud Short, in "short" knows his stuff like no one else and really cares about people and their cars.  He has a passion for getting the work done, and so well that you will be amazed by the details and his knowledge of how things should be done.   If you have a Mercedes or German import, they even use the paints that are used by the factory over the cheap stuff that most other shops use.   In "short",  Go to Bud Short, or be square...

A old phoenix institution.  At one time this place was known as the cork and Cleaver.  Food is excellent, I had the Philly Cheese Steak.  I have not had one this good since I left the East Coast when i was there for school.  Great place to have some beers with friends and watch sports.

Was served two flat beers, the pizza for my two year old came out cold, along with cold stiff fries.  The salads were fine, the shrimp I served was good.  The service they do have down, the wait staff was gracious and did the best they could.  The back kitchen needs SERIOUS work... SERIOUS work.  I will wait for a long time before I go back again.

This is one of Phoenix's most prized hidden gems.  I have eaten chinese food in San Francisco's Chinatown and Boston's China Town.  I have actually had better chinese food here.   The place is no frills, but if you want a real value, and you like fresh, tasty chinese food for a great price, then come give Wahsun a try.  Rose is the best!

Always enjoyable to visit at Postino. I love their salads, their wine selections have yet to disappoint. Their bread is superb, by the way. Give them a try!

Had a plate of tacos, Al pastor and Carne Asada.  The tortillas were fresh and tasty, and the meat was flavorful and juicy.  A great buy at 1.25 each.  Must not be missed!

Salsa was very good.   The Enchiladas I had were not very good.  Was not at all impressed with the cochinita pibil tacos, they were not like any I have ever had before.
