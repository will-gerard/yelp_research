BAD Home Depot Carpet Experience  Home Depot sent one of their people to measure my house for carpet, then they provided a quote based on those measurements, we agreed on a price and I payed it.  The carpet didn't show up for another 7 weeks (which was several weeks behind their original quote).  After they removed our old carpet they told us it was going to cost another $180 dollars to glue down some tacking strips. I had already paid for installation and I was not told their would be any additional fees. You can't change the price after you've already made and agreement.  What if I didn't have a $180 dollars? Were you going to walk out leaving me with cement floors and old carpet pad, since you already removed my carpet?  In this economy you can't quote people a price and then change.  VERY disappointed with the way Home Depot handled this.  I even called and gave them an opportunity to rectify the situation but they didn't.

My favorite Vietnamese restaurant.  I crave the crispy noodle cakes and fresh spring rolls regularly.  I love the owner who remembers me and my food preference each time I return.  I wish I could find more local restaurants like this.

One of my favorite places for breakfast/brunch: generous cinnamon rolls, unique omelette's, and more.  There can be a long wait on a weekend, so come early or late.

One of the most unique and charming spaces in the East Valley: furniture, clothing, unique home decor.  This gem in Mesa's historic district is locally owned and operated, offering amazing, personalized service.

My husband and I went here for our anniversary, and we were absolutely delighted.  (Just reading the menu is fun) start with dessert, each item is one of a kind.

Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.

I dream about the Boa Salad and the Pola Pola-Artichoke Ravioli.  This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants.

Festive food in a festive atmosphere.  I love the fish tacos: a great place for a group or a romantic evening.

I love pizza, and I've tried pizza all over the valley (including the famed Pizzaria Bianco), but I am yet to find a place I like better than La Grande Orange.  The crust is flavorful and crispy and the toppings are exotic and delicious.  The roasted corn is my topping of choice.  Their specialty salads are phenomenally good as well.  With Gelato and a grocery next door, it makes for a complete evening.  Spend the evening eating pizza, then come back for breakfast the next morning.

I call CPK, safe adventure.  It's great when you have to go somewhere with a large group, and you don't want to cave into a totally non-descript chain.  Everyone can find something on the menu that they can tolerate, and I actually think the pizzas are quite good.  The prices are average, and the service is typically friendly.  The next time you have a business meeting or large group to accomodate, I recommend it.

Mesa does not have a lot of fine dining, so Blue Adobe is really a gem.  I love the Vegetarian Chimichange and the fish tacos.  But perhaps my favorite part of the meal is the dinner salad.  They really know how to put together greens.  I highly recommend the entire experience.

Extremely professional and competent.  We had been having problems with our electrical panel for months.  Bryan was able to solve the problem immediately and eliminate a potentially deadly safety panel left by the electrician who installed the panel originally.  I would use him again in a heartbeat and give him my full recommendation.

I have been going to this yoga studio for about 3 three years and can't get enough of it.  The teachers are competent and inspiring, the environment is uplifting, and the class is challenging but achievable.  If you haven't tried hot yoga, I definitely recommend trying it out.

I've used Hannah dozens of times for everything from simple hem jobs to more complicated tailoring.  I'm always pleased with the results.  Her prices are fair and her work is consistent.  I really like working with her.  Occasionally she needs more time to finish something, but it's understandable.

I consider myself a Frozen Yogurt aficionado, I don't think there's a yogurt chain in the valley I haven't been to.  In its category (not too health-nut, not too artificial) I think Yodipty Yogurt is the best option available.    Their flavors change regularly and the toppings are endless, so its easy to go there on a weekly, bi-weekly, tri-weekly without getting bored.    Its friendly, clean, and most importantly yummy.  Definitely try it.

Another complaint on the front desk staff  I had two positive recommendations on Dr. Bullaro from my sister-in-laws and was excited to have a female doctor to deliver my third baby.  I wanted to meet her and get a feel for her office, so I called to have my IUD removed and have my annual.  I was told I could be scheduled 11 months later.  I can understand being busy and wanting to give priority to existing clients.  So when I was pregnant I called back and made an appointment.  I was able to get an appointment about a month later.  At that time I told Chelsea, the front desk receptionist, that I had had a previous ectopic pregnancy.  She didn't seem to be concerned by this. So I made a standard first appointment.  A few weeks later I started experiencing light cramping.  Under normal circumstances I wouldn't be concerned.  But with my previous ectopic pregnancy, my left fallopian tube burst, and I almost died from hemorrhaging because no one recognized the symptoms and assumed it was a standard miscarriage.    Slightly concerned by the localized cramping on my right side, I called Dr. Bullaro's office to ensure I could receive an ultrasound at my upcoming appt.  The front desk clerk Chelsea seemed annoyed or at least severely disinterested. She's probably a very nice person, but she does not come across that way on the phone.  Anyway she told me I couldn't be seen for an ultrasound and if I continued cramping I should go to the ER.  Luckily I found another doctor who got me in immediately and found that I had a large but harmless cyst on my right side that was causing the pain.  Now, I think Dr. Bullaro is probably a great doctor.  I've heard nothing but praise of her.  And I appreciate that her office is very busy.  But situations like this make me very wary of proceeding.

I've had two facials and two eyelash appointments at this salon and have been entirely impressed with the technicians, cleanliness of the office and pricing.  I started because of Groupon but will continue to go back.  Amanda's eyelash extensions stayed weeks longer than any other application I've had and Alicia's facials offer a visual difference.  Alicia is also very conscientious of what's safe for my pregnant skin needs.  Love this salon.  So happy I found it.
