I stopped here for coffee and a pastry this morning with my dog Caesar.  AJ's is known for its high quality food, wines  and it's great desserts but it is also a good place to take a dog for coffee.  I always get a table  away from a lot of traffic but my dog is a magnate for people who like animals.  So, he loves AJ's because he gets lots of attention and petting. The downside to having Caesar with me is that I can't go in and look at the little décor section of the store.  I love their accessories and have bought my share of items from there for stocking stuffers at Christmas time and for birthdays.

I usually like shopping at Michaels but I just don't like this store.  I don't like walking through the cramped doorway for starters. The customer service level also needs some upgrading.  Luckily I could find the supplies I needed without needing any help.  I've been in this store several times and the staff have never been all that helpful or friendly. This store is only down the street from Hobby Lobby where you can find some of the same items and then Jo-ann's really isn't that far away either, so you would think they'd be more responsive to their customers.  This store could use a makeover and it needs to provide its employees with some customer service training.

Four stars for their tilapia sandwich.  I was a little worried about ordering this since they are really known for the burgers, but I just didn't feel like a burger.  Fish was moist and flavorful.  Got sweet potato fries also.  Fries were very good.

Just got back from the Design and Construction Week tradeshow held at the  Vegas Convention Center.  Great venue for this show.  There had to be at least 100,000 people at the tradeshow and the only issue I had was not enough seats and phone chargers in the lobby area.  Facility was very comfortable given the size of the crowd.

This is a great little eatery. It is a very welcoming spot starting from the curb.  They staff is very friendly and the service is excellent.  They also offer you a free slice of bread - yummy.     It's known for its bread but it has both breakfast and lunch sandwich items on the menu.  The pastries are wonderful especially the cinnamon roll covered with cream cheese frosting.  They also have organic chocolate, gluten free items and a nice variety of specialty butters.  There are tables to eat at both inside and outside the store.I took  my dog Caesar there this morning and we both had some free bread.   Super delicious.

Given the variety of chairs, the hammock and love seat placed by the door even before you enter the doors, this place seems to be saying, "Come on in. Stay awhile".  And that's about what happens.   This store has just about everything - furniture, wine, coffee, chocolate and other foods, window coverings, pots and pans etc.  It's a little mecca of goodies right here in the desert.  And the staff are very helpful and very personable.  I had a few things in my hand and one of the guys gave me a basket and asked if he could help me choose between the two items I was pondering.    They do a nice job setting up their home-décor items.  Things are grouped together   so it is easy to focus on one thing at a time.  I always roam the whole store before I buy anything and the staff have always been helpful. If you haven't been here yet  -   try it, you'll like it.

This is a store where you can really lose track of time.  I always give myself extra time when I am coming here because it is so great to just browse.  It's like going into an old book store to me.  I can just be there for hours on end.  They have a great selection of wine but they also have beer and all the other types of liquor such as Gin, Bailey's Irish Cream etc.  If you go on a Friday or Saturday they have a small tasting area where they normally have about 4 wines to offer for tasting.  It's a nice way to get to know the wine.  They also have classes here.  This is a fun experience, just make sure you have the time and you have an ID because they do ask for it.

If you like contemporary and unique decor items than this is a store you should check out.  I just love walking around in here.  The furniture is well made and unique so there is always something that inspires or can generate a creative idea that can enhance your home.  The designers  are very knowledgeable, friendly and will help you with any questions you may have.  I took a photo of a bed they have on the floor that has a light on each side and mood lighting beneath the bed.  Again, it's not something you will see in every furniture store so  it's worth shopping here.  It can be pricey but they currently have a great sale going on - 30-60%.

With a friendly, knowledgeable staff and a great selection of lights this is a great place to shop for your lighting decor.  Take time to look around because they have a wide range of products other than lights - they have funiture pieces, mirrors and misc art that can make get accessories in any room.  Shopping here is fun as well as beneficial. And an extra bonus is that the prices are comparable or better when they have a sale. If you don't see what you are looking for they have lots and lots of catalogs and they are very good about helping you.

Andrea does a fabulous job cutting and styling my hair.  She has a good understanding of the type of cut that goes with the shape of your face.  I was so pleased with the way my hair turned out that I use a picture of me in that cut as the photo on my blog and other social media networking pages.  Andrea provides great customer service.  She does require payment in cash, so make sure you have that on hand,  If you bank at Wells there is one on the corner so it's easy to walk to from the salon.

I love the leather sofas, comfy chairs, the fireplace, brick walls and the general ambiance of this restaurant.  It's very warm and very conducive to just sitting in conversation while having a glass or two of wine.  I had the tomato bisque which was very good and the rock shrimp which was also good.  I sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly and knew his wines. My one negative though is in the pricing - too high for the dishes.     I'll go back again because I love settings in which the conversation is the art form.  Maybe next time I'll be there in time for happy hour.

I was disappointed in this store.  It's in the shopping center with Changing Hands and Trader Joes so I think it is wasting its opportunity.  On the positive side, it is a clean store and has room to walk around and look at the items.  And if you have items on consignment you get to choose between store credit or cash - store credit is 55%, cash is 45% if the item sells.  You have 90 days for the item to sell.  Then you need to pick it up or it becomes the property of Turn Style.  You need to keep track of the items, they don't call when the 90 days hit.  There's two big negatives to me regarding this store: overpriced items and pleasant but not friendly staff.   That's too bad because there is allot of traffic in that area due to the other stores.  I have a rule not to shop in stores that don't appreciate my business.  They can use some training in the customer service area.

People from the Philadelphia area know this name well.  The custard and water ice company originated there.  This is the best custard & Italian ice you will ever have.  This store has only been opened about 10 months but it is quickly becoming a community fixture.  If you've never had Italian ice then you owe it to yourself to try this one.  It's a real treat especially on our hot days. The staff at this location are knowledgeable and friendly.  And there is an endless number of choices.  Enjoy.

We stopped in here on a whim and I'm glad we did.  I love the intimate setting that welcomes you into the space.  The chairs are very comfortable and the lights are low enough for atmosphere but you can still read the menu.  And the food was wonderful.  The bruschetta is all about the topping and they don't skimp on the ingredients.  We had the Seasoned Vegetable Pizzette and it was very, very tasty.  The crust is made there and has that fabulous just baked taste and smell.  But the ultimate experience was the rabbit/ricotta filled ravioli appetizer.  Wow! You have to taste that for yourself.    My only suggestion is  to increase their wine list.  However, that will probably happen after they are there longer. They've only been open for about 9 months or so.
