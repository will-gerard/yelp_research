I have always received great help from Kenny, Norm and Philip. Other employees I have to threaten to call store owners just to get a question answered. This past week I was ignored by an employee and started blocking the aisle until they thought it would be beneficial to help me out.   Don't fall for the cabinet refacing scheme. They have wasted my time and bailed on the appointment that was set Saturday and confirmed Tuesday a few hours before. When I told them I would not like to reschedule or do business with them the lady just said that's to bad. I will opt to work with Lowe's, every employee there is always kind. Not just a handful.

Great experience today. I was actually rude and impatience with David in sporting goods early 7/1/16. He had every right to be rude back. But instead he was apologetic, patient, kind and personable. I felt so dumb for being rude because he was so kind. I hope that a member of management reads this to see how great of a job David is doing.

My goodness I love this spot! Be sure to order a "Steven" it's not on the menu but everyone knows it! Lisa makes it the best but that's expected because she's the owner! I always have a good convo with the employees and people just hanging out in the shop.

Last night my wife and I went to take a look at the TV's we were purchasing a Mother's Day gift and a personal tv. You would think that a transaction over a thousand dollars would be something to get the employees helping but that was not the case. My wife and I spoke with two employees, the gentleman tried to help and went to get a second opinion about something he was unsure about. The lady he brought was useless. I wish I would have seen her name so that I could let everyone know who to stay away from. She talked to me like I was an idiot even though I had my facts straight. They said there were 0 tvs in stock of the selection and then left. So we looked up the tv online and saw that there were 12 in stock for store pickup . So we went to customer service and the nicest woman ever helped us. Her name was Tatiana (I could be spelling wrong) but she was at the customer service desk 5/3/16 at around 8:00pm. Within 2 minutes she sold us the tv and scheduled a store pickup for the next business day. I am so thankful for people like her that made our experience better. SAMs Club should do whatever they can to keep her around.

I have been in twice in the last week, two employees, Abraham and Manuel were absolutely terrible. It is sad because you can see company policy that is solid, but these guys are not excited about it. The first time after a long talk with Manuel I took my mom home and got rid of any questions she had, Manuel left us with tons more questions then we walked in with. With Abraham I simply wanted to upgrade my phone and he was trying to change my service contract. It felt as if he was just trying to get me out. I have decided that the website and online avenue would be more helpful because the employees I dealt with were terrible. I Should  have asked for Juan like other helpers!

I had Tracy! She was great! I have never had any other people there so I can't speak for everyone. If you can request I would say to ask for Tracy. At one point I fell asleep I only know because my wife who was right next to me said that I was snoring so loud. It was just a relaxation massage for our anniversary but it was wonderful! Go with Tracy!
