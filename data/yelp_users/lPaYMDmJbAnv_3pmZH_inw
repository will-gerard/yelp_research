What can I say, best hand job Ive ever had!  These guys now how to handle my little bad boy. They hand wash getting him soapy and wet.. then they rinse him down so he glistens.. blow him really hard.. then rub him till he's like a shiny new penny. They even get down into my little guys cracks and crevices that most men wont go.  Oh how I love my little guy.. apparently they do to!

Okay being spoiled for so long was completely disappointed yesterday at the wash.. I had to go back over the car with a rag right there in front of them.. was bullshit that I was having to clean my own fucking car at the car wash.. I could have went to the cheapy place over by my house and got a better wash for half the price.  Still pissed!  Hand job indeed!

I couldn't possibly think about standing around outside waiting for a table at Pizzeria Bianco. So why not make the best of it and come next door to Bar Bianco.   A great wine list and an awesome selection of craft beers all reasonably priced! But the big allure for me is the old house that Bar Bianco is housed. Its just an amazing old house that has been lovingly cared for. All the details are still there and you can tell this place had a lot of love in it. The second you walk through the door the place has a just walked into grandma's house, make yourself at home kind of feel.   You cant go wrong here..

This by far is the most over rated green chile Ive ever has the displeasure of waiting an hour for! There are FAR better places in the valley that serve better green chile.. the tortillas however were awesome enough to go back for though with the lines of people I wouldn't even bother.

Here in Phoenix I think that we are pretty lucky to have such diversity in each neighborhood. Particularly South Phoenix where you can find great Soul Food at Lolo's Chicken and Waffles, Pizza at Amano, and of course various different types and regions of Mexican food. When I say Mexican food I'm really referring to the sort of hole in the wall, real deal family owned operations that are all over the south side of Phoenix. So many of them dot each street corner and call like the Sirens of the night. Marisco's Playa Hermosa is exactly what I mean by this.  "We bring the sea to the desert" is their slogan and it's so true. Stepping inside you'll feel like you were just transported to Mazatl√°n, Mexico, the only things missing here is the ocean. The place is just splashed with bright colors with hand carved tables and birds with a welcoming and friendly staff. With so much to take in it's hard to focus on any one thing, though with so many bird carvings hanging from the ceiling I almost felt like I was in the Tiki Room at Disneyland, less the chatter of the birds of course.   Chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant can be a very good benchmark to judge the rest of your meal, Marisco's would have to be at the top of these tests. Their chips are slightly thick, warm and a little on the oily side, this way the salt can adhere well to them. Accompanying are 2 different salsa, red and green. The red has a certain sweet and hot bitterness that is tasty and even better when washed down with a cold beer. The green is made of creamy avocado and with a warm chip is absolutely delicious. Neither were very hot but that's the thing with real deal Mexican food, its not always hot and spicy. So you'll have no reason to expect the "burning ring of fire" the next day!   With so many different and tasty sounding items to choose from, deciding was pretty tough as I really enjoy some good seafood. So imagine this, 8 large perfectly cooked shrimp, swimming in a creamy tomatillo and cilantro sauce, then topped with a sprinkling of cheese. If this sounds like something you would enjoy then go ahead and order the Camarones Culichi ($13.99). You will also get a basket of hot fresh corn or flour tortillas for dunking as well as rice, beans and a fresh lettuce salad dressed with lime juice. The beans have a nice texture with good flavor but the rice is nice! Well steamed and seasoned, the rice has a bright white color which might look bland, but after one bite you'll be wrapping it up in a hot tortilla and dunking it into the beans.   The Mojarra Frita ($15), a fried whole fried fish, sounds and looks good, but decided to be more like a daddy's little girl and order something less involved. Crab Enchilada's ($13) are not only the house specialty but are good to the last bite. 3 corn tortillas over stuffed with sweet crab meat, rolled together with cheese and covered in a slightly spicy red sauce. Again with the rice, beans and salad this is a pretty large plate and for the money, a great value. The enchiladas were actually featured in Gourmet Magazine at one time, who knew?  On the back of the menu you'll find a section called Camida Mexicana which are plates of regular Mexican fare such as burritos, taco's and fajitas. Not trying the Carne Asada Taco's ($6.99) would be a real shame since the meat is so tender and the flavor so beefy. A plate full of 3 tacos, double tortilla, chopped beef and onions, with rice and beans is both satisfying and ample. Douse the tacos with some of the guacamole salsa and you'll have a party on your plate! The Quesadilla ($7.99) is just cheese and a tortilla, while good it was quite ordinary. However the smell from the Fajitas De Pollo ($10.99) was amazing! I'll have those to myself next time!  For dessert you can stick with maybe a Mexican Coke ($2) made with real sugar or a large glass of over ice Horchata ($2.50). Though for something more, the Flan ($4) was different than what you normally get. More cake like and dense than silky smooth, it was decent enough and a nice finish to so many savory dishes. Otherwise there aren't any other desserts offers, like you'll have room after such good sized portions anyway.   Marisco's Playa Hermosa is a real gem and has the menu, friendliness and comfortable vibe to back it up. While the neighborhood feels a bit on the seedy side, as they say, nothing ventured, nothing gained?

Of course I'm always late to the party on this one!   The Mr and I had our second date here. There was a festival going on called Chiles and Chocolate that I thought would be super cool since he's a pastry chef and I'm a total food centric.. he and I walked the grounds almost hand in hand (we were both kind of new) until we found this mud hut (hogan I think).. let's just say it was nice and quiet like over in that part of the gardens.. who knew it would be such a great place for a second date make out session. I felt so lucky to be with a man like him.. as we left the mud hut and continued walking I noticed all the women looking at him, the way I looked at him.. infatuated and palpitated.. he was everything I had been looking for....  Whoa Nelly.. this is about the Desert Botanical Gardens.. the place is great! Super romantic and a great date place!!

The smell, the vibe and feel as soon as I opened my car door was apparent. This is very Asian for the likes of pretty much every street corner in parts of LA. I only wish we had a more concentrated ethnic specific area beyond south Phoenix like LA.. or any other city for that matter. Hell, look at the Asian part of town in Vegas, its awesome!

All I can say is thank you, thank you to Helen Y for once again turning me onto another style of Asian cuisine. I had no idea that there were so many places here in our wonderful city for authentic Asian cooking.   At first glance you see the English menu and you see the Chinese menu.. tell them to keep the English menu and translate the Chinese menu. The English menu is the typical stuff you'd find at any American Chinese food place.. now the Chinese menu is where all the good stuff is. Fortunately Helen speaks and read Chinese so it was a snap. Ive been super excited about trying Shanghainese cooking and this place was no disappointment.  Of course my eyes are bigger than my tummy (really they are) and we ordered a ton of food. Had spicy tendon, water boiled fish, soup dumplings, rice cake (awesome) pork belly with pickled vegetable and some green veggie dish that I'm not sure what it was but very tasty. Here's the breakdown..  Rice Cake..  Off the chain rice noodle disks with shredded meat and sauce  Soup Dumplings.. dumplings filled with a meat ball and meaty broth.. oh yeah!!  Spicy Tendon.. yes, that would be cow tendon that has been stewed in a spicy sauce and served cold or room temperature.. trust me, a little strange but all about the texture.  Water Boiled Fish.. this come in a pot with tons of chile flakes and cilantro.. its bold and very saucy, not watery as the translation might have you believe.. this one is good times!  Pork Belly with Preserved Veggies.. braised pork belly on top of pickled veggies but not like you'd think.. the veggies look like mulch but taste much better. The pork belly is really tender and fun to eat!  Avoid the sweet and sour bullshit and go right for the goods!!

As Helen Y. put it 'numbingly spicy'! The flavors were pretty happening and quite exotic. Most of the dishes that we tried were off of the special Chinese menu in the leather bound menu. I couldn't tell you exactly what we were eating as we volunteered Helen Y. to order for the table.. she did a fantastic job selecting dishes that all worked very well with one another. She knows here Asian style cuisine.. I will gladly eat with her any day!   After only a few bites my tongue was literally tingling from the chilies they used. Now these don't burn your mouth or throat like Mexican chilies do.. just makes your tongue sort of numb but very very good in flavor and texture.   I was worried about this place since I read that service was so slow. Maybe they have been on here because the place was pretty crowded and the service was fantastically friendly and attentive.   Now I am pondering.. what can one do with a numb tongue?

The poor Szechwan peppercorn used to get a bad wrap. For the unfamiliar its not even related to the black peppercorn, for the familiar its spice properties can be quite magical. Actually the dried berry husk from the prickly ash tree, the USDA banned the peppercorn from 1968-2006. The peppercorn was seen as a hazard due to the potential of carrying citrus canker, a harmful bacteria to citrus crops. The process of heating them to 160 degrees kills any possible bacteria thus lifting the ban. Szechwan Palace, located in the Chinese Cultural Center, celebrates this daily. If you've ever tasted such dishes as Ma Po Tofu or Kung Poa Chicken, then you've had Szechwan cooking before.  The funny thing about these peppercorns is that they're not even really that spicy. At first the flavor might have a certain peppery pungency that gives way to more of a citrus like aftertaste. Though here's the kicker, as you eat them you might feel your tongue start to tingle then eventually go slightly numb. This sensation is strangely addictive, like getting a shot of Novocain; it might just leave you drooling over your plate.  For the unadventurous Szechwan Palace does serve your standard type Chin-American food like egg rolls and pork fried rice, but this isn't a strong point. Id skip those items and go right for the more unique dishes, be sure to ask for the full menu rather than the standard "best of" version.  Being a fan of offal and other not so famous cuts of beef, I ordered up the #3 Beef Tendon in Spicy Sauce ($6.95). Fresh cilantro and chewy slices of tendon are mixed with peppercorn oil were a hit. I know that dish isn't for everyone but trust me, its tasty. By contrast the #9 Spicy Cucumber ($3.95) is a little more approachable with cool pieces of raw cucumber seasoned with peppercorns and dried chilies.  There are a slew of dishes titled "water boiled" though none that I have tried seem to be in water. Instead you get a luxurious sauce filled with peppercorns, vegetables and meat or fish. This outing included the #18 Water Boiled Beef ($9.95), fork tender strips of beef in a velvety pepper spiked sauce made my tongue sparkle then go numb. Like I said, these peppercorns are magical.  My absolute favorite dish was the #98 Rice Cake ($7.95). The thin chewy disks of rice noodles, ground pork and cabbage were bathed in a slightly sweet and smoky sauce was craveable.   When ordering the Special Cumin Lamb with Bone ($11.95), Id venture to say that they use the word lamb loosely. The difference between a lamb and a sheep is age and this directly reflects the flavor of the meat. The younger lamb is sweet and tender where sheep aka mutton tends to be extremely gamy and tough, these were definitely the later. No amount of fragrant cumin could cover the extreme gaminess of the meat. This may have been isolated since on a previous visit the dish was exceptional.  With over 100 choices on the menu plus daily specials, Szechwan Palace brings a whole new level of spice, even if it does numb your tongue.

I don't even know where to begin to point out all the sucks about Macayo's.. they have NO redeeming qualities about them. Greasy chips, tasteless watery salsa and horrible food!  We ate at this location twice and both times we ordered the mini chimi's which BOTH times came to the table frozen in the middle! Uhg! Most learn from their mistakes, not here.. they make the same mistakes and obviously don't care enough to try to make things right.  Both entree's were served to us at room temperature. Chicken Quesadailla and the Baja Enchilada.   If you want to have decent Mexican food please, go somewhere else! For this style of food I think I would prefer Carlos O'briens.

I of course have a crush on Chris Bianco. Not because of his rugged good looks or what could be hiding behind his fly but because of his ideals and passions. He is committed to the finest ingredients.. the best techniques and has the knowledge to pull it all together almost daily with consistency. I admire what he does and it simply shows in all that he makes.   PB for me is hands down the best place in town for a great rustic sandwich. The flavors and textures are simple yet when combined offer a complexity that's hard to beat. Down to earth this place directly reflects the passion of it's owner.   Chris Bianco should run for president.. no bs.. no lying about WMD.. just true and real, honest to goodness.

Yay dinner!!!  It's no big secret that I'm a huge fan of Chris Bianco. His simple honest to goodness approach to food is not only inspiring but down right delicious. If you're one of his fans who don't mind waiting 4 hours for one of his amazing pies at Pizzeria Bianco, then you're in for a real treat. While they don't serve pizza, one of my all time favorites, Pane Bianco is now serving dinner and no serious wait either! In addition to ordering one of their famous sandwiches, you can expect an ever changing menu of rustic Italian inspired plates.  If you've been to Pane you know the drill, go in, order at the counter then either decide to take your score home, or eat there on one of the communal outdoor tables. No wine or beer is served at this time but there is talk of Pane expanding into the Lux Coffee space next door which will eventually offer inside seating and hopefully wine by the glass. If all of this goes down, Lux will simply move to the adjacent building also getting a larger space. For me Bianco's food just screams for a glassed of red wine.  Ordering the Crespelle ($12) had me really excited due to the unique nature of the dish itself. Basically an Italian crepe made the garbanzo bean flour; it's filled with luscious ricotta cheese, hints of spinach then bathed in a slightly sweet tomato sauce. It was clear that after the first bite I was in love with this dish, I simply couldn't stop though glares from my dining companions made me to relinquish the plate.   I can't sing enough praises for Biancos Housemade Mozzarella ($8), thick slabs of hand pulled cheese is paired with fresh tomatoes, a few leaves of basil, olive oil and a sprinkling of salt, that's it. The resulting texture and flavor is so toothsome and fresh that I've yet to have another as good. The salad comes with bread which I put to good use soaking up every drop of the salads milky elixir.   Served on house made flat bread, the Soppressata with Aged Provolone ($8) which also comes topped with a healthy shave of Parmesan cheese and slices of roasted onion. The pungency from the provolone is a nice compliment to the pork-tastic slices of soppressata.   Bianco is dedicated to local purveyors and for good reason, they make some of the best Phoenix has to offer. Take the Sausage with beluga lentils and polenta ($10) for instance. The sausage comes from our very own Schreiner's Fine Sausages over on 7th Street and let me just say, this plump link had just the right amount of meaty well seasoned punch to compliment the hearty lentils and super moist polenta cake.  If you're more of a lighter eater, I'd suggest the highly flavorful Roasted Seasonal Vegetables ($5). On my last visit the pan was filled with long thick spears of asparagus, sweet potato, cabbage, radishes, broccolini and cloves of garlic. Grab a loaf of their chewy bread ($3) and you have yourself a vegetarian option even a meat eater like me would love.  Now if they added pizza to the menu, my life would be complete.

This has to be one of my favorite Chinese places in town.. they make some very special dishes that I just crave!!!  Boiled Wantons Salt and Pepper Shrimp Orange Chicken  Ive had other things but for me these dishes are just bursting with flavor! Plus the service is great! They seem genuinely happy to see us when we show up!

So we walked into this place around 6pm.. it was SO hot and humid in there it was barely tolerable. After we were sat this baby started screaming and puking all over the mother, the table, itself.. was pretty disgusting. After getting over that the waitress brought over menu and chips and salsa. Took one bite of the salsa, that was it.. out of here. The salsa here is from a can.. tasted like tin with some added cumin. The chips were cold, greasy, stale and soggy form the humidity. Threw a buck in the table and walked out.   Perhaps its better in the winter time sans the swamp coolers and the puking baby?

I get into these wild food moods where Ill wake up and have a craving for something, its usually pretty specific, this particular morning it was corned beef. Sounds crazy but once I get it in my head I wont be satisfied until I give into my cravings. I wasn't hungry though for just any corned beef, it had to be Boar's Head brand, aside from a few grocery stores the only place you can get Boar's Head is a good delicatessen. I knew just where to go, Scott's!  Situated between an Ace Hardware and a Basha's, this seems hardly the spot for a tasty sandwich. Let me tell you, they serve up massive tasty sandwiches with thick piled meat on your choice of bread and they have choices. Feeling helpless and at complete mercy to my urges I ordered Scott's Perfect Reuben-Reuben ($11.50). So tall you cant get your mouth around it, its stuffed with corned beef, swiss cheese and sauerkraut then grilled to a crispy buttery goodness.  When the server set my sandwich in front of me my eyes widened, it was a thing of beauty and desire. As I managed my sandwich for the first bite, I felt the wafts of hot corned beef beckoning, eat me, eat me. Enjoying bite after satisfying bite, my morning craving was quickly becoming fulfilled like an ancient prophecy. Ordering a side of Russian dressing to dunk my fries into may sound slightly odd but after one dip I think you'll agree, its perfectly natural.  For the health conscious who are rolling their eyes at my delicious choices, Scott's does offer lighter fare such as salads, soup and half sandwiches. However, I for one don't go to Scott's to eat light, I go to Scott's eat well.

If you're on Twitter you'll see so many different places you can follow. Its cool to because they announce deals and such that are coming soon. For instance, Coup des Tartes tweeted that they would be running the Yelp Eats menu this past Friday and Saturday. I was super excited because the night I was supposed to go there was a family emergency and I had to cancel. Anyway, once we arrived we were given the standard menu so we asked about the Yelp Eats menu, "oh yeah sure". What was brought back was not the Yelp Eats menu but some 3 course prix fix menu for $25 that didn't even have one Yelp Eats item on it. No onion tart, no lamb shank etc.. VERY disappointing and irritating. Do not call a Ferrari a Corvette, no matter how you slice it, they aren't the same thing.   Anyway.. ended up ordering the pate and onion tart appetizers. The pate is not house made and tasted like liverwurst, the onion tart was very good. However, once we learned that there was no wine service and a (correction, not $12) $9 corkage fee, that was the nail in the coffin, we were out the door.   At the end of the day they falsely tweeted to get customers in the door then try to pass off something that isn't. Very misleading, the classic bait and switch apparently still works.

I put my body through hell and back.. some months Ill low carb others Ill eat WAY to much of everything.. the American yoyo diet I suppose. On the eve of my low carb madness I come to Europa to pick up a few goodies.  The cheese and cherry coffee cake is the BEST Ive ever tasted! Moist flaky crust covered in cheese and canned cherries.. sheer delight and a real middle finger to the low carb diet!   I feel so good and bad all at the same time.

I love my Macbook Pro.. I love my iPhone.. I love my iPod.. I love almost everything Apple except the stores.. I'm sorry but this place isnt much better then Best Buy.. a bunch of think-they-know-it-all teenagers running the front of the store.   Hubby washed his iPhone and needed to get a replacement.. seems reasonable right? Well some kid in the front was trying to make us an appt through a mac in the front.. ya know walking back to the genius bar seems to me to be so much easier.. He finally told us that their weren't any appts left and we would have to come back.. oh my inner b*tch came out full force, she, I mean he didn't know what hit him.. we were at the Genius Bar in moments.. they replaced the iPhone ($200) which was very cool but a real hassle getting there in the first place.   Take deep calming breathes when you visit this store.

Id love to share with you my new go-to date night spot. It's filled with so much charm and romance we both were simply glowing with post dinner elation. The place, Vincent's Market Bistro is the scaled down version of the fine dining classic Vincent's of Camelback. It's funny that a place like this is so well hidden without even a hint of signage beyond a sandwich board on the street. Just look for the main Vincent's sign and follow it around back to the Market Bistro entrance, they're housed in the same building.   Chef and owner Vincent Guerithault keeps the menu decidedly French with hints of Southwestern flare that he's so famous for. You should look this guy up; he's got some accolades including a James Beard award under his belt. Does kudos translate to good cookery, you bet!   For one of my favorites, be sure to look for the Curly Endive Salad ($9) with mustard dressing, bacon, and a poached egg. I saw it, I ordered it, I swooned over it. A well balanced ratio of salty, sweet and sour then fresh cracked pepper completes the equation.   Pizza offerings are done well with a tender pale crust that seemed more akin to pastry then to your typical chewy crispy offering. Tarte Flamb√©e ($8) was topped with a light cream sauce, bacon, onion and thyme. Another pork laden pizza was the Caprese ($8) topped with pesto, arugula, mozzarella and prosciutto. I just wished that the greens were put on after cooking instead of before.  For dinner you'll find classics including the cooked in its own fat Crispy Duck Confit ($16) with lentils and bacon, sensing a porky theme here? The tender mallard leg was succulent and intense in flavor while the lentils performed well by countering the richness of the meat. For something a little bit lighter, I use that word loosely, order up the Coq au Vin ($10). Red wine braised chicken served atop gratin potatoes were hearty and comforting.   Vincent's Market Bistro also offers a $20, 3 course Prix Fixe menu. On my last visit delights were abound with the likes of creamy Butternut Squash Ravioli, Rainbow Trout and a scrumptiously sour Lemon Tart. This has to be one of the best deals in town that I know of. I mean really, food from a James Beard award winning chef at these prices is unheard of.   Great food, good prices and excellent service all set in a romantic atmosphere, well; there is one caveat, the hours. Vincent's Market Bistro closes at 8pm, so plan on eating early. We arrived around 6pm on a Saturday night and by 7pm the place was completely filled. Be sure to check their website for times including breakfast, brunch and lunch.

By now, I'm guessing that everyone has been to Postino Winecafe. If for some cosmic reason you haven't made it, you really should.  Sometimes you just aren't ready to go straight home from work. That's when it's time to tap your local neighborhood eatery, pull up a chair and unwind.  Postino Winecaf√© is one of those hangouts. Its first location opened in 2001 by the same folks subsequently responsible for La Grande Orange and LGO Pizzeria. Even if either location isn't in your 'hood, you'll quickly feel welcomed by an attractive and friendly staff.  At the Arcadia location I visited, parking is at a premium, so it's a good idea to come early or late. Checking the car into the valet (only $3) will save potential aggravation. Parking is complimentary at the Central location.  As I sat taking in the crowd and the space, I couldn't help but ponder: Should I order beer or wine? With a worldwide and world class selection, there is plenty to choose from.  I was feeling like a Belgium beer, so I went for the Chimay Grand Reserve ($8). At quadruple the flavor and double the alcohol content compared to domestics, this beer has a certain yeasty earthiness that's surprisingly not heavy or thick.  A small bowl of olives came to the table so I could start chowing down with my drink selection. They're smart by teasing with a small bowl because after one olive you'll want to order a full bowl ($5) with a blend of Luques, Picholines, Gaetas, Red Cerignolas, Arbequinas and Castelvetranos.  Snacking and sharing is key to the menu, but if you want to compose dinner out of salads and sandwiches, that's just as easy.  The Pub Board ($10) severs up a soft, hot and steamy pretzels made from local bakery MJ Bread. Alongside are a selection of Schreiner's chorizo, cornichon pickles, aged cheddar and giant Spanish corn nuts for a major snack attack.  Panini, a grilled Italian sandwich, has many varieties. On this visit the Nine Iron ($9.50) was just all right. Filled with hickory-smoked bacon and layered with grilled chicken and fresh burrata mozzarella, it sounds like a hole-in-one, but the soggy lettuce left me in the sand trap.  The salad that came along was dressed well but it was composed of too many pieces of white and bitter romain cores. After mentioning this to the server it this was quickly addressed with apologies. It's OK to share your expectations with any establishment, whether good or bad.  Bruschetta ($12.75), four to an order grilled bread covered with a choice of preparations, scored major kudos. It was love at first bite! My choices were Prosciutto with Figs and Mascarpone, Tomato Jam and Fresh Sheep's Milk Cheese, Albacore Tuna with Gaeta Olives and Salami with Pesto. Salty, creamy, sweet and chewy -- this was a full-on taste party!  The Salted Caramel Sundae ($5) was the grand finale. Vanilla ice cream with chocolate-covered corn nuts and a pretzel stick with a salted caramel shot was all I ever wanted.  This is food that I love to eat -- clean, simple and fresh. When paired with my favorite beer or wine, I could easily stop by on my way home from work every night.

Sitting here thinking of my shitty Wendy's experience of late and wondered why I didn't go here. Also, why haven't I Yelped this place?!  The lil' bad boys are awesome! Juicy, salty and hot.. all the elements for a great burger.. plus they're so little you wont feel badly, even if you eat 6 like I did! The only thing I felt after that was satisfied!  I cant give 5 stars because of their messed up hours.. WTF is 8pm as a closing time?!

Overpriced and rude.. I wont give this place (or the asshole attendant) another cent of my money.   There was a spot on my hood so I was using the squeegee to get it off (it was less then the size of a dime) when the attendant runs out and tells me to stop using the squeegee on my hood. His reasoning, that the next person to use it expects a clean squeegee.. this doesn't make one bit of sense.. what would be the difference of me cleaning dead bugs off of my windshield or from the hood of my car? Nothing. Whether I used it on my hood or on my windshield the squeegee is getting dirty.   All it takes is one rude asshole to alienate a customer which he did with flying colors.

Ya know in this economy you cant go wrong with saving a few bucks here and there right? 2 loves of yummy whole grain bread, 3.50.. a loaf of cinnamon raisin bread, 1.00.. 2 boxes of 100 calorie pack cupcakes, a 1.00 each.. box of Twinkie, priceless, well, 1.00!   Super friendly and knew all about the specials at Roberto's next door.. though I think she had to many Twinkie's herself because she was a real talker and was clearly sugar juiced!

Why do airports have to be SO fucked up? I mean just to pick someone up is like this huge undertaking.. you of course have all the stupid people driving 2 miles an hour to find their loved one.. then you have the selfish pricks who wont let you over.. so maybe I should be Yelping asshole Phoenix drivers rather then the airport but I wouldn't have dealt with them if the airport layout would have been more conducive for drop off and pick up. Its a real cluster fuck over there!

Back in the day I used to drive all the way from Surprise to eat here, yes the food was that good. They used to have the most killer Pollo Fundido as well as amazing chunky salsa.   Time has certainly changed this place.. we started with a cheese crisp with green chiles, delicious.. nice and crispy with just the right amount of chile strips.. also ordered their killer chunky salsa which was as good as I remember it.   Then come my Pollo Fundido swimming, Im serious about this, swimming in a pool of grease!! They didn't even bother draining the thing before tossing it onto my plate. Was disgusting too, not even like clear oil but dark brown grease. Vile. Then the Misters Sampler showed up.. this thing was a fucking mess! You couldn't tell what was what under the piles of sauce and lettuce until you took a bite. Mini chimis were burnt, mini tacos burnt, tamales, cold and hard.. was a complete wreck.   After a few bites we called it.. major loss of appetite.. a shame too cause the salsa was actually really good but the entrees were inedible.   Meanwhile, the Mister was attached to the toilet within a few hours of eating here.. he was sick all day the next too.. so word of caution, eat here at your own risk.  Im sure going to miss the good meals I used to have here, what a real shame.

Ive been craving udon and ramen probably for the last month or so. While I was in Awatukee today I saw this place in the shopping center I was visiting. Oh yeah, this is going to hit the spot!  You know when you're in trouble when you go in and the place is empty. Continuing in I saw udon on the menu board.. my cravings overrode my sensibility to leave, oh how do I hate my cravings. Got to the counter and couldn't stop myself.. order the shrimp tempura udon. After about 3 minutes later the smallest of bowls appeared.. can you call something this small a bowl, more like a bo since far to small to use the whole word.   Well instead of griping about paying 7 bucks plus tax for my bo of udon cravings took over again! I tried the broth first.. hmmm, pretty unimaginative.. for whatever reason I though it was going to be good, just salty.. the shrimp, gummy and soup logged.. okay here comes the udon!!! Like eating rubber bands.. tough, chewy and actually kind of strange. The only thing that was decent about the bo was these little pink and white half slices.. very chewy and pretty cool texture.. I would have rather had a bowl of those then anything else in the bo in front of me.   After about 5 bites I threw it out and left.. still craving good udon or ramen.. any ideas? Please!!!

On a cold winter day, the craving for hot comfort in a bowl makes a person do strange things. It found me driving to a kind of shady part of Mesa, while braving the cold winds in search of a perfect bowl of ph√≤.  My new holy grail of Vietnamese restaurants is Ph√∫ Th√†nh, located in a rundown strip mall on Southern and Extension. A good Vietnamese restaurant is usually kind of old, slightly dingy and super cheap, and in this case all the basics were met and exceeded.  Ph√∫ Th√†nh is a no-frills kind of place. Inside it screams for a makeover. Though clearly from another era, it is clean and functional. The service is friendly and the kitchen is fast.  There might be a slight familiarity here the owners of Ph√∫ Th√†nh and my favorite central Vietnamese joint Da V√†ng are brothers. The menus of the two places are almost identical, and they offer a lot.  The No. 50 Ch√† Gi√≤ ($2) is what good Vietnamese cooking is all about. Two golden-brown, crunchy egg rolls filled with shrimp and pork are hands on and interactive. Served with a plate of lettuce leaves and herbs, you wrap the egg roll in lettuce and garnish with mint and cilantro, then dunk them into the house-made n?√≤c ch√¢m, a sweet and spicy dipping sauce. The fresh lettuce and herbs cut through the richness of the egg roll, which on its own might be slightly oily.  Applying the same hands-on approach, the No. 54 B√°nh X√®o ($3.95) replaces the rolls with a pan-fried rice flour crepe. The exterior is slightly crispy, while the soft interior is filled with shrimp and bean sprouts. Of all the B√°nh X√®o I've tried, this version is by far my favorite. It's full of flavor and texture.  Ph√≥ (pronounced like the bad word) is not only fun to say, but fun to eat. Eight versions of the noodle soup are offered, from traditional beef to chicken. Pay attention to the menu description when ordering since you might wind up with unfamiliar cuts of meat.  I'm adventurous and love the textures of beef tendon and tripe, so I was in heaven when my steaming bowl of No. 1 Ph√≤ Ph√∫ Th√†nh ($4.95) arrived. The broth was incredibly fragrant with clove and star anise. This really should be made into an air freshener.  Along with the condiments at the table, the soup comes with a plateful of basil and bean sprouts. But also include limes and chilis to add texture, flavor and depth to your pho experience.  For something hearty and comforting, the No. 7 M√¨ B√≤ Kho ($4.75) is a bowl of chewy egg noodles filled with a beef stew. Tender pieces of stewed carrots and beef grace the rich and complex flavors of the dark and tasty brew.  If you're carbohydrate loading, order a slab of French bread to absorb all of the bone-warming elixir at the bottom of the bowl.  For food like this, a little shady is worth the drive.

For the Phoenix Metro, it doesn't get much better then this! They even sell tapioca pearls for my occasional much needed bubble tea fix! Plus they sell tendon and trip for pho.. oh the delights and treasures in store for me on each visit are amazing! I get butterfly's every time I'm on my way there! Sort of like going to Disneyland for the first time.. love and good times!  I love Lee Lee! Its the real deal!

If you've never been to downtown Gilbert to visit Joe's Real BBQ, Liberty Market is another reason to check it out. Not only are there those 2 destination worthy places to chow, but Hale Centre Theatre which offers live performance theatre for post eating entertainment. The icon for downtown Gilbert is a massive water tower that is just amazing to stand by. I know its just a water tower but the history, being built in 1923, and the scale, 123 feet tall, it's quite a sight to stand underneath. With a 3 million dollar renovation and new park surrounding the tower, it's both modern and well, cool.   Here is some good news if you're a fan of Joe's Real BBQ or Joe's Farm Grill; restaurateur Joe Johnston also owns Liberty Market. So you'll know right away that there will be high quality and tasty food at very affordable prices. This is also due to the fact that Chef David Traina and his wife Kiersten are pretty much running the show at Liberty. Both were so helpful that we felt like we were honored guests; as I'm sure most will feel when visiting. Chef David came from behind the open kitchen and greeted us personally. His gorgeous wife Kiersten was so helpful as she had many recommendations from the menu and drink list as we ordered. Its customer service like this that will not only make you a loyal guest, but you'll quickly share this experience with your friends.  Built in 1935 the building has been lovingly restored into that retro-American-modern feel that the other restaurants have. On a side note, be sure to check out the bathrooms, there are several in which to chose and each has its own theme. To get things moving along at Liberty you stand in line and place your order at the counter, then they give you a number to place on the table and when your order is ready they bring it out to you. There are quite a few places to sit including a large patio, main indoor dining room and a long bar overlooking the wood-burning oven. This is the place to be if you love to see your dinner being made before your eyes, its up close and very personal.  Depending on what time of day you go the menu has its bases covered. From the coffee bar to a fun and interesting breakfast menu as well as the main menu, you might be hard pressed to just order one thing. The main menu is comprised of sandwiches, pizza's, salads and cold case offerings such a fresh hummus and potato salad. You may also be happy to know that they serve beer and wine to compliment your dinner choices, priced so well that you may want to try more than one if you're not driving.  Be sure to take a look at the wall of kitschy gift items like bear shaped salt and peppershakers and Party Snaps. Who didn't play with those when they were a kid?  Being all about fresh and local we started with the Antipasto ($11), which was large enough to share between 4 big eaters. A large serving platter covered in Molinari and Sons cured meats, roasted Brussels sprouts, baby carrots, olives and slices of artisanal cheese were a delight. The grilled bread that came with the platter was a nice compliment to the deliciously salty cured meats. Instead of ordering the Caprese Salad ($8) we opted for the Caprese Sandwich ($7), which even came with a cold case side dish. The corn, tomato + bean side was a bounty of freshness from the crunchy corn to the smooth toothsome Navy beans. This was a real compliment to the wonderful flavors of the mozzarella, sliced tomato, fresh basil and balsamic on the sandwich. The Liberty Joe ($7) is a take on the classic Sloppy Joe enjoyed by millions of kids over the years. Tender ground beef in a rich and hearty tomato sauce a top a toasted bun, lots of love for this one. Mac and cheese was the only side that could have been chosen for this one, kid heaven!  The pizza's are all hand tossed and baked in a beautiful Renato wood-burning oven. The pizza crusts that come from this oven are lightly crisp, slightly charred and simply scrumptious! Starting with the White ($11) this one is not to be missed! If the combination of cream sauce and smoked mozzarella wasn't enough, wait till you taste the chopped bacon and tender pieces of chicken, oolala! Another sure fire hit was the Grilled Sausage ($10) covered in stringy mozzarella, roasted onions and tomato sauce. While the Molinari ($11) sounded great, the cooking of sliced cured meats makes them way to salty and intense for my taste, gamey.  Desserts vary from day to day, so on our visit we had the pleasure of a slab of Red Velvet Cake ($5). If you've never had red velvet, please do. Moist chocolate cake covered in thick frosting of cream cheese delight. If you're in the mood for something a little different, order the Bread Pudding ($5). This was probably the lightest bread pudding I've ever had, which was more like French toast pillows swimming in a sea of creamy love.  Load up the car with friends and go ahead, make the trip to Gilbert and see what you had no idea existed.

I love LM in so many ways and on this visit I found one more thing to go absolutely mad for, the Sticky Bun. As I stood in line to order my dinner I heard something call out.. "eat me".. as I looked over into the baked goods display I heard it again.. "eat me".. as I cocked my head I leaned in and asked "are you talking to me?" I only heard silence but knew what was calling to me, it was the Sticky Bun. It was truly a sight to see, beckoning with its deep cinnamon brown color, adorned with glistening candied pecans and thick chewy glaze, I couldn't turn my head but to order with a finger point.. "Ill have that with a side of ice cream".. I felt as if I was in some sort of trance.. I cant look away!   When my Sticky Bun was delivered to my table I couldn't help but stare into the caramel covered abyss. I wondered if I could get the whole thing into my mouth at once? What was I thinking? That would be complete and udder madness!! Let's be calm and rational about this. A gorgeous Sticky Bun calls to me from a pastry case and asks me to eat it. I'm simply fulfilling a last wish and request and boy did I, the Sticky Bun was absolutely delicious.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3N9U549Zse8UP-MwKZAjAQ?select=sScx9DACVnL26MafdtQZ6A

Oink, oink! If you love pork this is the place to go! They have pretty much anything pork and at extremely fair pricing. They also have bbq pulled pork by the pound as well as ready made green chile burros. Let me tell you what, the green chile burro was so darn good that we ran back in there and bought 4 more!   They use corn fed all natural hogs from the Midwest and smoke and cut on premises. The place is seriously awesome!  We bought..  Baby Back Ribs (The meatiest Ive ever seen, seriously!) St Louis Style Ribs Smoked Hamhocks Jalapeno Bologna (nothing like the stuff from the store) Pork Roast (Having tonight with white bean puree and acorn squash) 5 Green Chile Burros 1LB of BBQ Pulled Pork Peppered Bacon Old Fashioned Hot Dogs  Spent only 90 bucks!!

Driving to Queen Creek for "poryk bits".. well we both love pork and were both low carb'n so we go to the Pork Shop once every 2 months or so to stock up on "porky bits", pepper bacon (the same they use at Matt's Big Breakfast), chops, sausages, brats, salami, roast, ribs etc.. all the parts and bits of the pork that taste great.. if you eat pork this is the place to go! Its mad and quite delish!   A cool thing, you can order a head and pick up, see latest menu as of 1/24/08 in photo section! Also, dont forget to try a green chile burro, smoked pork in a spicy green chile sauce, amazing! They also just added BBQ pork burritos as well..   If you ever dream of pork.

In a pinch I love Hi Health.. when you forget to order protein shake or metabolism boosters online, this is good in a pinch. Also buy one get one half off is always a real draw for me but you have to have one of their stupidity cards (those lame little plastic p.o.s. that go on your key chain) to get that deal. However online you'll save that and some from other nutrition e-tailers.   Stores are decent enough and usually have a hottie or 2 working there.. I love it when they have to bend over to grab something off of a lower shelf.. makes the pinch even better!

As a foodie, cook and native Arizonan, I've always had this strange misconception about eating fish and seafood in a landlocked state. My mindset was simply this, don't do it. You see it only took that one bad experience from years ago and I've held ever single seafood restaurant accountable since. With the passage of time and through technology, modern shipping and refrigeration methods the life of fresh fish and seafood has been greatly extended. So much so that my attitude towards eating fish has turned around completely and now I crave it.  While fish was exiled from my life, Sakana sushi was quietly building a mini sushi empire of Japanese restaurants. Since opening their first in 1996 they've continued to expand and now with 4 valley locations, it won't be hard to get your sushi fix without breaking the bank, especially at lunch time.   Each day Sakana offers several different daily creations and specials in addition to the 15 or so items on their standard lunch menu. Between you and me, go for one of the daily specials. These lunch plates are massive and will satisfy the most famished of appetites. You'll see exactly what I mean if you order up the Chicken Maturi ($8.99). A whole chicken breast pounded out into 2 thin slabs, breaded and deep fried until golden and crunchy is then dressed with a slightly sweet soy sauce. Oh and that's not all, along side is a salad of mixed greens and a half of a crab filled California roll. You will not leave hungry.  Along with a happy upbeat greeting when you arrive at Sakana, Miso soup comes standard just as soon as you sit down; talk about an efficient lunch service. For a light snack to accompany the soup I also enjoy ordering Edamame ($3.25); steamed soybeans sprinkled with salt, that are as much fun to say as they are to eat.  Many people do not understand the difference between sushi and sashimi. This is actually really easy; sushi refers to the vinegar cooked rice while sashimi refers solely to the fish itself. To see the difference first hand, order the Sakana Lunch ($9.99). Thin slices of sashimi; raw salmon, tuna, shrimp, albacore and house smoked salmon are placed on top of sushi; rice. Served on a wooden board, a California roll and a rotating fried item accompany the special.   If you're dieting and trying to watch your starch intake, Id highly recommend trying the Sashimi Deluxe ($11.99). Not only do you get a crispy salad but a platter filled with a delicious combination of sliced salmon, tuna, albacore and hiramasa aka Australian King Yellow Tail. However this line up isn't set in stone as the chef will change these out with what's available any given day. What you can take for granted is the freshness and quality of each type of fish served.  For the price, Sakana is hard to beat, though for peace of mind, I would have gladly paid more.

Oy vay! If I had a Jewish grandmother this is what she would have said about me eating to much! My make believe grandmothers name is Chompie, short for Selchompma.   I try to visit her as often as I can even when its been a few weeks she always welcomes me back, like a good grandmother does. She makes the chewy yummy bagels that a chubby guy like me cant resist.. her pirogies are so delicious that 8 of them aren't enough.. everything she has ever cooked me has always hit the spot.. oh Nana Chompie  knows that spot really well.. from the home made pickles she puts on the table to the deep fried goodness of the Monte Cristo sandwich.  I take solace knowing that she will always be there for me, even though she is just a wonderful deli.. I look forward to her warm embrace.

Why I hate Houston's... sounds like a fun start to not so glowing review, huh? This one will be short and sweet..   Since when can you not wear a baseball cap into a chain restaurant? Seriously.. this place is like TGI Fridays without the kitschy crap on the walls. Apparently they have a "Appropriate Attire Required" sign on the door. Its in the smallest letters at the foot of the door so I had no idea that my cap was inappropriate.. fucking come on? Its not some swank restaurant at an even swankier resort or hotel.. its a dated chain restaurant, where families come to stuff their faces with well priced food. Now for a chain its much nicer than some but still a chain. Their house rule of trying to be something theyre not is pretty stupid.   Though kudos to the manager for not kicking us out as there of course was a confrontation. I love confrontations.. she had no reasonable explanation for the rule except that it was their rule. While I will never go back to Houston's again because of their idiotic rule I will say the food and service was acceptable.

I gave up in Bashas a long time ago because of service issues. I usually shop at Trader Joes but I saw that Bashas was having a sale on meat and decided to give them another chance, they disappointed again. Not only was I grossly over charged, they argued with me about it. I don't care whos fault it is or was, just make it right. Finally after about 10 minutes they refunded the difference. Grrr.. I don't think Ill be going back anytime soon.

I usually hate this location (bad service, poor selection) but last night I had the best customer service Ive ever had at any Home Depot. I was asked several times by several different workers if I needed help with anything. It was fantastic having that level of service! Maybe they are going to turn it around?

UA Theaters have had it! Why do they keep this place open? Its run down, out of date and well, architecturally ugly! Oh yeah, this is the place that looks just like Space Mountain at Disneyland.. though the only thrill you'll get from here is when they finally bulldoze it down!   They really should put a Harkin's there where there outta be one!

Hate is such a strong word.. I try not to use when I its not really called for. When I set out to Yelp the Safeway across the street from me and the Mr.'s place I thought of using that word to describe how much I don't like this Safeway.  Of course it's warranted, they pissed me off!  Okay you know how they always do BOGOF on milk.. well me and the Mr don't drink that much milk so the cashier usually just gives me half off the 1 gallon. Well this time she forgot to and I didn't notice until I got home.. so seeing that I used to shop here once a week I figured Id just bring my receipt back the following week. Well the following week I went in and showed the receipt and the dumb bitch behind the counter was like, 'what am I supposed to do about it?'.. I explained to her what usually happens as the cashier gives it to me for half off.. she then proceeded to ask me which cashier was doing that, 'it's not our policy.' After going back and forth for a few minutes I finally just told her to give me my 2 bucks.. she told me if I would have brought them the receipt back the same day they would have done something about it. Are you f-ing kidding me? Whats the difference besides my being inconvenienced having to drive back there. So I finally asked her if she was willing to lose a potential lifetime customer over 2 bucks? She responded, 'there's nothing I can do for you.' I then told her that her customer service skills suck and that I will NEVER return to the store.   I guess never say never since I went into my very much disliked Safeway the other day. Believe it or not they make a pretty damn good sandwich and I despise Subway. So the 2 stars are for the yummy sandwich and the super cute guy who made it!   So much for my convictions?!

So Santa was very generous this past Xmas.. he left me loads of yummy eats gift cards including Flo's Asian Kitchen.. Ive been here once before and while I liked it, thought that the lacking service and typical dishes found pretty much anywhere else would stop me from coming back. Well can't disappoint Santa!  I'm not a fan of the dumbed down over sugared, over salted Americanized fluff supposed Chinese places that have been serving in our lovely urban sprawl for some time.. THAT place starts with initials. Flo's offers many different regional specialties done very well. For instance the Calamari with Chile's was just plain awesome.. simple and fresh, crusted calamari with chile's, no sauce, sugar, goop or glop.. just simple and delicious.  The chicken curry skewers we're so tender and flavorful with the additional taste of coconut milk.. oh how I heart coconut milk!   Service was good and the Tiger beers were nice and cold.. will certainly return to Flo's soon! Also to be mentioned, while this place gets busy not nearly the noise level of Thompson Peak.. actually very intimate considering the size of the dining room.   Thank you Santa.. I love you!

When I hear the name Giuseppe I picture a little old man in the kitchen making spaghetti and meatballs like his grandmother used to make. So I was surprised when I found out that there isn't anyone named Giuseppe working in the back, though this wasn't the only surprise of the evening. The other little curve ball was a little embarrassing, we were scrambling to scrape together enough money to pay the bill, Ristorante Giuseppe only takes cash. However, this little stumble did not interfere with the food nor the fantastic service and hospitality we received.   Ristorante Giuseppe is what a mom and pop independent restaurant is all about. The charismatic father runs the front of the house, the sons are the servers and mom makes all of the desserts. The father Pasquale interacts with everyone, he's so warm and welcoming it was like going to a friends home for dinner. While they do not serve liquor, you're more than welcome to bring your own beer and wine to accompany your dinner and no corkage fee, unbelievable.   The menu is filled with classic Italian-American dishes and as well as assorted daily specials. Our server was telling us about the specials and noticed that his eyes were steel blue. I'm not sure how long he was talking to us but as soon as he walked away my trance was broken; I have no idea what he said. I can be such a dork.  Once you place your order you're brought out a basket of warm bread with garlic butter, I love little touches like this. Just be careful not to fill up on the fluffy bread, there's so much in store starting with the deliciously simple Eggplant Rollatini ($9.75). Slices of eggplant are lined with cheese, covered in bread crumbs and pan fried, then the roll ups are covered with tomato sauce and cheese. Or if you loved stewed peppers and onions try the Peperonata ($6.95), a great combination of sweet, savory with just a hint of spice.   My dining companions filled me in on the nightly specials which ended up being a couple of pasta dishes. The first was the Peppino Special ($15.95), a mix of tube pasta, alfredo and tomato sauces with meatballs, chicken and sausage then covered with cheese and baked. Another was the big brother to the tortellini called Tortelloni ($15.95), a large ring shaped pasta, filled with meat then again covered in sauce, cheese and baked. Do you see the trend here? Baked pasta dishes are so hearty and satisfying; no wonder the other patrons looked so happy.   Along side we also had Sausages ($1.95) and Meatballs ($1.95) which were platted as a clever homage to the maleness of the restaurant, with just a little bit of cream sauce on the tip of each sausage, well you get the idea.   Desserts were as comforting and homey like the creamy smooth Cheesecake ($3.95) which ended up being one of the best slices of cheesecake I've had in a very long time. Not being a fan of Cannoli ($3.95) Id have to say that they turned me into a believer. Its ricotta filling was so light and airy with just the right amount of chocolate chips and a pastry shell that was crisp without a trace of greasiness.   Genuine and honest, Ristorante Giuseppe is a neighborhood gem that I wish was in my neighborhood.

Where is he? Where is my uncle?   There was a time and a place when I loved Uncle Sam's.. huge tasty cheesesteaks.. wonderful fried mushrooms and zucchini plus some of the best ranch dressing Ive ever had! I would brag about how awesome this place was until I took a few friends there. This place has gone from awesome to chintzy over salted frozen bag fried yuck!   Cheesesteaks are super salty to a degree that makes them inedible.. the ranch dressing tastes out of a jar.. and the ex-yummy fried foods seem like they came from a freezer bag. What a real disappointment.. what happened? Change owners? The staff used to be so friendly now they seem they could care less.   I miss my uncle.. he used to love me in a very special way.

Yes, this place still REALLY sucks! A girlfriend of ours works there so we went to say hi.. while the service was great the food, not so much. Pizza here is horrid.. the crust and the topping were so dried out it was inedible.   I ask you this.. why the hell would you need to order extra cheese and a cheesesteak? Makes about as much as sense as a trailer trash woman from Alaska as our next vice president.

So me and the Mr are knee deep in guest room remodeling. So tonight we were going to have Bo Kho (Beef Stew, Vietnamese Style) but I fell asleep and didn't get it started in time to eat at a decent hour.   So on our way back from (another) trip to Home Depot we decided just to grab a burger. Now mind you I haven't eaten fast food for years.. I remember Wendy's having a delicious juicy burger, piping hot and yummy! Well to my surprise when I found that they didn't have my 1/4 double stack any longer but some little piece of shit called a Burger Buster, or something.. Well it sure the hell was, they busted the burger right out of that shit.. it wasn't burger but perhaps some dirt and belly button lint held together with some sort of emulsifier. This thing wasn't juicy nor tasty.. just cheap and nasty!  You know what? Someone should punch that little red head bitch in the face!

I was watching the news this morning, Greece is on fire. The idea of this wonderful country burning down one forest at a time is upsetting and disastrous. This is a country I have always wanted to see and know that it will be years before its forests can recover from the devastation.  As I'm watching this devastating news my tummy starts to rumble and I think, Alladin's. Alladin's will help to make me feel better, I need to connect with the people somehow. Why not with food?  Alladin's Kitchen is a wonderful Middle Eastern restaurant serving up fantastic hummus, baba ganoush as well as other Mediterranean favorites. They also make some of the best stuffed grape leaves Ive had to date. The menu is very accessible as well as priced extremely well. Do yourself a favor and try the chicken shawarma wrapped in soft grilled pita as well as the gyros.   i know eating the foods of the Middle East isn't going to put out the fires and bring back the loss of the nations people but the food did make me feel better.

So sad that Aladdin's is closed. This was by far some of the Best Middle Eastern eats in the valley. I sure hope they open a new place in a better location. Already missing their garlic dressing!

You know when you get a craving for that old school American style Chinese food.. the kind thats a little greasy but tasty and comforting.. well this is the place! Incidentally next door to LA Fitness the place generally crawls with muscleicious guys for their post work out meal.. tonight of course was no exception.. I digress..  They make all the usual suspects, sweet and sours, moo shu's, fried crispy bits and such. I really dig the thick muscle.. I mean, Chippie's Family Style Tofu.. lightly fried tofu with loads of veggies in a brown sauce, yummy! Be sure to ask him to make it spicy!! The Hot and Spicy Cabbage Salad is also yummy and refreshing.   We all have these neighborhood Chinese places, usually family owned.. not great, not sucky but just what the craving called for.

Searching for a lunch option after a hard shop at Costco we deiced to check this place since it was just around the corner. This place is a little bit dirty, the first table we were sat at was covered in ants.. we told the waiter and he shrugged and I asked if we wanted to move?! Hello?! No I want to sit with the ants.. maybe they will like some chips and salsa also? Dipshit.   Anyway, the service and kitchen were pretty quick. Ordered a cheese crisp which was actually really good.. super crispy, melty cheesy goodness.. the Mr ordered a Grilled Chicken Ceasar Salad.. Im like WTF?! I ordered the pollo chicken something.. you know the one with the deep fried chicken burrito smothered in cheddar cheese and cream cheese.. it was pretty good I suppose but the rice was so dry I thought it was uncooked.. the Mr's Salad was WAY over dressed.. well duh!  All in all this was place was just so so.. the ants were a real turn off.. for this style of Mexican Id say that there are other places who do it better and cheaper.   I wonder how those ants would have tasted deep fried?

I love beer. No I'm not talking about the mass marketed, mass distributed stuff that supposedly tastes great and is less filling. I'm talking about the flavorful heady craft brews that are interesting and actually flavorful. I enjoy beer much like I do food; it's a celebration of diversity, history and sensual stimulation, simply put, it appeals to all of your senses. One of the many cool things about beer is that it's like a meal in itself. With so many varieties to chose from there's bound to be one for every individual appetite out there.  Now where to get a great pint for a reasonable price?  If you're not familiar, Four Peaks Brewery has been serving up tasty pints in the valley for years. Having 2 locations and a loyal following of people who appreciate beer, tasty pub grub at super low prices, both locations are pretty hopping on most nights. If you've ever heard of Kilt Lifter and 8th Street Ale which are served in most valley restaurants, those are Four Peaks creations.  The Tempe location actually has the whole brewery thing going on in a large warehouse type space, which was a creamery back in the day that now has the massive stainless steel vats for making some of their most beloved brews. The Scottsdale location has a similar warehouse feel including a more private mezzanine level. The bartenders and wait staff are very attractive and friendly, which you know gets kudos from me and if one of them is sporting a beard, even better! Though with the case of our server, it was definitely style over substance, maybe a bad hair day?  Besides being with friends there isn't anything that goes better with good beer than good food. The menu seems to have been written with the beer in mind as well as used as an ingredient. The menu isn't super large but is easy to navigate with many salads, sandwiches and pizza's to choose from. Aside from everything being well priced, the portions are quite hefty, you won't leave hungry.  If you visit their website, be sure to sign up for the daily menu specials email. You'll receive 2 emails a day that features lunch and dinner specials for that day or night. The specials menu really gives the Four Peaks chefs a chance to be even more fun and creative. They can also be followed on Twitter as well as Facebook, isn't social networking great?!  Great meals here begin with a great beer.  You'll notice a chalk board up on the wall displaying which beer is available including its alcohol content. You can use this as a point of reference as to how loaded you might end up. So be careful with the darker beers, not only will they fill you up like a meal in a glass but tend to get you snookered before the meal arrives. The Portero Chingon ($3) was an amazing Porter full of dark complexities with hints of chocolate and coffee. Those notes for me paired very well with the BBQ Chicken Pizza ($14.50/$17.50) which had a nice sweet and smoky sauce loaded with tender chicken breast. Pizzas come in 2 sizes, 12" and 14" but the 12" is of good heft and made a great appetizer for the table.   To stand up to some of the stronger flavors of beer, the Bleu Light Special Burger ($9) with its thick juicy patty, hickory smoked bacon and smothered with blue cheese crumbles, was well grounded and a solid choice. Just to let you in on something, Four Peaks makes amazing beer bread it's similar to a really soft pita and makes for a great substitute to an ordinary bun. All sandwiches are served with your choice of beer battered fries, pasta salad or a garden salad; I went for the fries and couldn't have been happier with my choice. The fries are so light and crunchy you might finish yours and eat off a friend's plate and no I didn't do that. Yes I did.  Now some sandwiches are served natively on beer bread like the Grilled Chicken Beer Bread ($9). They start with grilled chicken breast then add saut√©ed artichoke hearts, mushrooms, green peppers, red onion, mozzarella and then top with a creamy cucumber sauce for a Greek/Mediterranean flare. Try ordering a Hefeweizen ($4) to accompany since the bright lemon notes tasted so great with the chicken and vegetables on the sandwich. Or, have a beer sampler with your meal ($9) so you can taste several different beers and see which one works best for your tastes. The melted Swiss cheese and the tangy sauerkraut on the Reuben ($8.50) tasted good with the Kilt Lifter ($4) but I'm excited to try the Oatmeal Stout ($4) next time.  Beer bread, beer battered fries and drinking beer, sounds like a beer fest right? It get's even more interesting for desserts, you wont find a Tiramisu like this one. Called the Stoutamisu ($5) they take espresso soaked chocolate sponge cake, then layer it with Oatmeal Stout lady fingers and chocolate mascarpone cream. Its feather light and a mile high though not as sickening sweet as many I've tried. Goes down like many of the Four Peaks brews, nice and smooth.

Back in the day when I was 'straight' my wife and I used to frequent this place regularly. The thing is when we lived in Surprise there wasn't much else besides chains and even then I had a good sense to avoid them.  So now that she and I are apart and still the best of friends, when I visit we still go here. It has to be one of the most consistent places Ive been too.   They are more of a Mexican seafood place but don't be fooled.. they make a great carne asada quesadilla and the queso fundido con chorizo with fresh home made flour tortillas... so yummy it makes my chest hurt thinking about it! Also have a 99 cent margarita and daily beer specials.. be sure to try the refrieds, they have to make them with full on lard cause they are good and full of flavor!  Even though I'm a bit lighter in the loafers these days I still look upon the good times me and the Mrs had here.

As usual consistently delicious and super friendly. Had the queso fundido con chorizo.. just awesome! Melty goodness with bits of chorizo thrown on top.. the flour tortillas I think are made in the back because they are so tender and delicious.. also had the Swiss Enchiladas.. dynamite! Tender shredded beef laid into corn tortillas covered in green sauce and cheese.. yum! Also they make wonderful refried beans.. you cant go wrong.. real deal Mexican food here!

Mr Goodcents is such a guilty pleasure if mine. I just love how squishy their white bread is! The bread pairs well with all of the deli meats they slice to order.   Simple, fresh and way tastier than many of the other chain (you know who you are) sub shops.

This is the first service I've had on my car since moving to Vegas. After reading the reviews I was seriously concerned about the level of quality and service at either Desert BMW location. After 1 phone call my angst was put to ease.. The lady who helped schedule my appointment was super nice and made my first impression a positive one.   Upon arrival I was promptly greeted and my service advisor, Marco, walked me through what was going to be happening and how long this was going to take. He also let me know when to bring my car back for other services (oil change, etc) that my car won't tell me about.   They were done in less than the time they said it was going to take and they even washed my car. Hell yeah!

I'm a pretty big fan of Trader Joe's and have been shopping at various locations for years. I'd like to point out that the TJ's I used to frequent (Scottsdale, AZ) does not carry hard liquor. So I almost squealed (actually I did) when I saw that the beer and wine wall was longer and had my beloved Knob Creek. I love that you can totally buy booze here. Yeah!   The thing I love most about Trader Joe's is that I trust what they are selling. I view their products as being high quality and low cost. I can write a grocery list and food budget knowing what their prices are going to be. Take milk for instance, a gallon here at regular price is as low as most big box grocery stores charge for milk that's on sale. Same with eggs, butter, yogurt, well you get the idea. Don't show up expecting to buy Coke and Pepsi as TJ's stocks mostly their own brands though they have TJ versions of most major items.   My only problem with this location is that the parking lot during peak hours is messed up and awkward. However Id like to point out that most parking lots in Las Vegas are pretty messed up and make little to no sense. That felt good to get off my chest. The sweet spot visitation time is around 2pm. You can park close to the entrance and there wont be much of a line.   If you've never been maybe do a weeks shopping in there and see what you think. TJ's brand Pesto + Gnocchi + Italian Sausage = hearty amazing dinner.

With our mouths still on fire from an amazing meal at Lotus of Siam, Luv-It has become our goto spot for cooling our ravaged tongues.   This is window ordering at its finest. There are no seats but there is a really large parking lot where you can stand and eat your custard. Each day features new flavors though chocolate and vanilla are always on the board. The list of available flavors is to the left of the ordering window.   If you've never been I highly recommend a small cup of vanilla so you can enjoy the texture and try to pick out the differences between frozen custard and standard ice cream. After that order yourself a Western Special, your choice of available flavored custard topped with warm caramel and toasted nuts. Ive also tried the Banana Split which is pretty much what you'd expect, textural delights.   You can also create your own custom sundae with all the available flavors and toppings. This is great for the person who knows what they like and knows how to get it.   Luv-It oh how I love your creamy goodness.

We had checked out a few restaurant supply stores for chefs jackets and hadn't found anything until we made our last stop at LVU for one last shot. Score! After figuring out how to get inside (we walked through an embroidery/seamstress shop) and were immediately greeted by a super friendly man standing just inside the store. He directed us to the chefs section which was amazingly huge, seriously they even had a chef jacket in my size! But get this, they had a humongous clearance rack where most of the jackets were under $10! It was a fuck yeah moment! The Mr got several jackets and I even got one for myself and you know what? I look super woofy in it too!

We had reservations for Lotus of Siam but arrived way to early. So what better way to spend a little time waiting than a friendly neighborhood gay bar. Just at the east of Lotus in the same shopping center, Badlands is your welcoming darkly lit mega friendly watering-hole while you wait for you table place. Drink prices are reasonable and the bartender was engaging and personable, zero attitude here. Totally thsuper!

I consider myself a serious bread whore (hello, look at my belly!). So when me and the Mister started settling into our new LV digs I started a mission to find some killer artisan bread to replace my beloved MJ Breads in Phoenix.   After kissing and tasting some serious bread frogs around the city I finally discovered Bon Breads while wandering around Town Square. When we walked in I instantly became moist around the lips, I had to eat this bread! We bought 5 loaves however one of them didn't even make it to the car. Amazingly chewy, lightly crisp and a tender open crumb I have to tell ya, these guys over at Bon know what they are doing.

New city, new doctor.. while Ive been here since last April I had still been looking for a good doctor to look after me. I tried another doctor but his bedside manor was well, lacking. So after talking to some friends Dr Dino Gonzales was suggested to me  Dr. Gonzales has a great disposition and is super friendly. The office has recently converted to an electronic system so its becomes more efficient and timely since the first time I visited. They also have a lab in house so you don't have to go out for blood work. This is pretty huge in my book, easy breezy!

*UPDATE* They got a new pastry chef in there that makes the most awesome cupcakes! Oh yeah, do yourself a favor and try the Red Velvet Cupcake.. killer, seriously!   The first time I tried Willo many years back I was unimpressed as the bread was to doughy and heavy for my tastes. Well I recently tried Willo after having a horrible "funky monkey" and cibatta from another local bakery. This place has SO improved! I bought an olive loaf and was blown away by the open soft airy crumb to the chewy slightly crisp crust. Oh they have won me over!!!

So I'm sitting here going through my Yelps and am dumbfounded that I have never wrote about Lolo's.. been coming here for a couple years now and when it comes to soul food, it aint much better than this!   There isn't much I can add here but concur how amazing the fried chicken is.. the only sucky thing on the menu was the red velvet cake.. horrid but the cream cheese frosting was so great that you didn't notice that the cake sucked right away.

Uh, Oh, Oh, Woke up today, feeling the way I always do.. Uh, Oh, Oh..   Last night was the first time I've been to the Orpheum (Hairspray, 5 stars!).. what a fantastic theatre! Classic architecture.. very good sound quality and of course comfy seats. All ushers were extremely friendly and helpful unlike some theatre in Tempe were the snotty ASU students, well..  This theatre is SO Phoenix!  It fits right in with the current scene downtown..taking the old and making it new again!   A class act (no pun intended, uhg)!

The red and green chile here are some of the most comforting and tasty Ive had. The red chile for me is the wholly grail of red chile's which all are compared.. now take the red chile and put a couple of over easy eggs on top with a side of beans and hash browns and you get a Nana's Breakfast! Served all day Sunday coupled with their awesome chip bar, fantastic!!  When it comes to red and green chile, it doesn't get any better then this!

Friday and Saturday night, 7-9, 75 cent domestic bottles! Hello, can I buy the next round! Great place, smoking patio and cold beer (be sure to order from front bar). Crowd is pretty mixed and allot of fun. Though why, gawd, why did they put dividers between the urinals.. come on now, it is a gay bar for Pete's sake!

I have a simple life, big and small, soft and crispy, full of obvious contradictions and some surprising incarnations. The life of a tortilla is much like anyone else full of glamour, large family drama and constant transformation. I'd like to share that story with you here today, my life as a tortilla.  Ever since being a young kernel of corn I've know I was different from the rest of the ear. While the other kernels longed to be cereal and ethanol, I knew that I wanted to be a star. Celebrated each and every day, giving promise of a brighter and tastier future. Then it happened, I was suddenly plucked, mashed, rolled and pressed, being transformed from the ugly duckling into the beautiful swan I always knew I was. Destined for greatness in the kitchen of Mi Patio, I knew it was all coming true for I am the corn tortilla.  From the second you walk in the door of my home, you can sense my presence. Bold colors, comfortable seating and smiling faces were all there to celebrate my life and times. As soon as you are seated a hot, lightly salty and crispy bowl of me is sat onto the table. They've cut me into triangles so I'm easier to handle, then I'm deep-fried golden and simply beautiful. My 2 friends, Mild and Spicy, are a couple of salsas that love to hang out all over me. Go ahead, grab me and dip me deep into one of them, slather me in their tomato goodness, I deserve it as much as you do. I have another friend, the cold and refreshing Margarita ($1.75), who simply completes me. Enjoy them slowly while the wandering minstrels play requests from my motherland of Mexico, this would bring a joyful tear to me eye, if I had one.  On the menu you can find many of my brothers, sisters and cousins. My cousin Quesapilla ($6.35) is a real show off though his beginnings are quite humble. Some also call him native fry bread but I just call him a crowd pleasure. Stuffed with gobs of cheese and griddled until melted and bubbly, he tastes just as good as he looks. Spoon on some fresh pico de gallo and you'll see why the ladies swoon and the men groom. My sister from another mother, Quesadilla ($5.95) is a total sweetheart. She's wide, thin and crispy all covered with cheese and I mean that in the nicest possible way. She, Mild and Spicy have a triad relationship, all complementing one another in each melted bite.  Baja Chicken Burro ($8.35) is one of my favorite uncles. He's the uncle who shows up delicious and golden brown, draped in an outrageous creamy coat of sour cream and cilantro, Id have to say he is all about glamour and fashion. Much like season 1 of Project Runway where Jay McCarroll and Wendy Pepper would cat fight every single week, my uncle Baja simply does not get along with auntie Huevos Rancheros ($8.35), a snide but delicious bitch. Her fluffy eggs are perfectly cooked, her delicious Ranchero sauce and her rice and beans make for a satisfying anytime platter.  Not liking to sound like a total me-me, I do have to say that I taste pretty good wrapped around Carne Asada con Pico de Gallo ($11.75). Tender steak grilled to a nice medium and served with pico de gallo, rice and beans. All you have to do is fill me up with some of your juicy meat and it's a win-win scenario. I get to soak up your meat juice and you get to eat all 6" of my round deliciousness.  Every family has a black sheep and mine is no exception. Coming from a Greek father and a Mexican mother, Gyros Chimi ($8.50), is one of mystery and excitement. Inside she is full of tender slices of roasted gyro meat, gently deep fried then she's covered in the perfect accessory, creamy cucumber sauce. To add to her difference she is served with a hearty baked zucchini complete with sliced onion and a rich tomato sauce. You'll have no idea what you're getting yourself into until you take your first bite, delish.  Unlike auntie Huevos, the Chorizo and Egg Burro ($6.55), is tasty and uncomplicated. Any chance I get to soak in sauce I'm so there! Try the #106 Beef Taco, Cheese Enchilada, Rice & Beans ($8.55) for a celebration of soak. Stuffed with cheese then covered in a slightly sweet and spicy sauce I taste real good if I can say so myself. I also enjoy being bent over, deep-fried then filled with beef and topped with lettuce and tomatoes. One bite into my crunchy exterior exposes my goods for you to enjoy completely.  I'm a firm believer that a meal is never complete without something sugary, it doesn't have to be too big. Fry bread with Cinnamon & Honey ($3.25) is sticky and sweet cousin of mine, who I like to call Fannie. Like my other cousin Quesapilla, she's golden brown, chewy and drizzled with honey and a sprinkle of cinnamon. After tasting Fannie, you might wonder why you've never given her a taste before?  Now that I've been able to share so much of myself with you here today, I feel a great peace and inner joy that can only be brought out by my loyal fans. In whatever form I take from a taco to a warm steamy basket know this, I am here for u.

Love, love, love Indian Fry Bread house.. so warm and comforting, speaks directly to my heart and my arteries. I only indulge every once and a while but damn these are good. My favorite is the version topped with green chile, lettuce, tomato and cheese, grab a squeezy of salsa and you're set!  Definitely one of those home grown places that you should take out of towners!

This place hands down has the best Pho in the valley! Yes the place is dirty and a total dive but that just adds to the experience.. if it were clean I don't think it would be very good. My theory is that Vietnamese places are usually a little dirty cause it's good luck!   The BBQ pork B√°nh m√¨ just makes my mouth so damn horny! I'm dripping just thinking about it! Be sure to try the B√°nh m√¨ bo kho (beef stew), its the best Ive had and none in Westminster or Santa Ana have come close.

Burgers have taken on a highfalutin, gourmet attitude, but there are still a few places that make just a regular hamburger, albeit some with hole-in-the-wall status. Open since 1965, The Original Wineburger in Phoenix hits high marks when it comes dive hangouts, but most of all, they make one killer burger.  Walking into Wineburger, you'll feel as if you've been transported to another place and time, and this is a good thing. Surrounded by wood paneling, Formica-topped tables and the glow of neon beer signs, the atmosphere is comfortable and relaxed. Diners seat themselves in either the main bar area or the game area.  A burger joint doesn't bring visions of healthy light snack and salads; let's face it, you're here to eat thick slabs of meat and fried accompaniments. So it's no surprise the menu is full of fried delights, like the tasty Mini Corn Dogs ($4.75), finger-sized corn dogs that were fresh and hot.  I also enjoyed the Cheddar Pints ($5), battered cheese curds deep fried to a golden brown perfection, a Wisconsin favorite.  When it comes to burgers, the Original Wineburger's fanciest ingredient is a splash of sangria to help enhance the beef's natural flavor and juiciness. The Original Wineburger ($5.75), one-third pound of certified Angus Beef, was cooked perfectly medium and oozing with cheddar cheese. Each juicy bite was hinted with wine, which gave the burger a slightly sweet edge.  The Super Wineburger ($8.75) is a two-third pound version of the original, though after a few bites I realized that they forgot to use wine on this one. The bacon I added to my burger provided a fair amount of porky smokiness.  What's a tasty burger without a tasty beer? Complimenting the salty beefiness, Moose Drool Brown Ale ($3.50) was ice cold and had a sweet malty flavor. Surprisingly light for a brown ale, it was a pleasure drinking. While the Trout Slayer Filtered Wheat Beer ($3.50) was slightly bitter at first, it mellowed into a sweet smoothness that sort of reminded me of an apple.  When it comes to burgers, simplicity is king -- it's still just two pieces of bread and a ground meat patty.

While Dr. Doug's (Dr Douglas Cunningham) office isn't really close to where I live, it's good to know that he is one of the most friendly, thorough and cute doctors Ive had. You know its good to have a doc that's cute, makes the trip in even more worth it. Many of his patients are also gay men so he knows what a gay guy needs.. omg, that sounded funny! Let me try again, he knows the special medical needs of gay men such as std screenings (if applicable), check for anal cancer etc..   Dr Doug, thanks for taking such great care of me and the Mr!!

I loved this place.. comfortable, friendly, well priced and above all tasty! Met mother here for lunch after hearing so many wonderful things about it. My friend was right, old school, comforting Mexican food.. we started with a Mary Lou which is a quesadilla filled with red or green chile.. had the green chile and it was outstanding. Crispy cheesy goodness dripping with well seasoned green chile, winner!   For lunch I had the taco and enchilada plate.. the taco shell was a little bit chewy but tasted good. Cheese enchilada was the star.. you couldn't tell where the sauce ended and the cheese began because both were so creamy and smooth. I could have eaten 3-4 of these things.  When in the 'hood this will certainly get added to regular rotation.

Won't be long before this place goes under. Hole in the wall doesn't always mean good food. Tried the Beef Pho, hands down worst Ive ever had. Beef stock from a can with buckets of pepper poured into it. No aroma and the 'salad' was pathetic, no basil.. what's that all about? I didn't try the other dishes which might be unfair. However I will not be back to try anything else, just not worth it to me!

This is hands down one the best 'berto's restaurant. However they have nothing to do with the other 'berto's, sharing name only. This is the place that was featured in Diners, Drive Ins and Dives on Food Network..  Okay it is in a gas station though really, its super clean, OMG friendly and the food was awesome! They make this red salsa that I could have slathered all over the Mr's body and licked it off.. fresh, tasty and cheap.. whats not to love!  Had the California Burrito.. carna asada, guacamole, pico de gallo.. my mouth is watering thinking about that burrito! Also shared a cheese quesadilla which was all about the salsa dipping! I just wish that Guy Fieri was there, WOOF!  Roberto's in the Shell Gas Station is a hidden gem.. seriously, its awesome!

This place reminds me of visiting in Mexico. Upon entering its kind of worn down and relaxed.. the staff smiles at you through the smoky air. The smoke lingering is from the fajitas juices hitting mesquite charcoal as they bring them to your table. Heavenly!  Now Ive been here many times of the years as it's very close to my work. When there are vendors in town we usually take them here as a nice alternative to all the chains that they seem to prefer. So over time Ive tried many dishes here but my favorite is what's called a Pechuga.. breast of chicken with melted cheese served between two flour tortillas. For me this is so good because of the trio of salsa's they bring to you after your sat. They make a green, a red and a pico de gallo so the Pechuga is the perfect platform for all their tasty salsa's. The #15 comes with the Pechuga as well as 2 beef tacos.. the taco's aren't served in those greasy hard shells but in fresh corn tortillas.. Mexico City style! Another great crevice to pour loads of salsa into! Mmm!  Salsa and crevice.. what a great combo!

Me and the Mr finally got a chance to go here.. simple, easy and well presented.. you cant go wrong here even though my fat ass only ordered a smoothie and steel cut oats.. now the Mr he ordered Eggs Benedict.. huge yummy looking portion of ooey gooey eggy goodness.. I wanted to dive face first into his plate! Instead I ate my oats and loved every bite.. perfectly cooked and served with brown sugar and milk, just like mom's before her divorce introduced her to the single life. Oh those were the days.  Id go at opening if you're hungry 'cause there is always a wait!

This place is officially off of our rotation and we will never return!   We spent a nice weekend in San Diego and decided on the way home we would have a Mexican lunch. Well we got here and were sat immediately which is pretty normal.. then we waited for 10 minutes before we finally asked for some service as we were still sitting without water and chips. So the hostess sat us somewwhere else.. we sat another 5 minutes with no service. We got up an left with a vow to never return!  By the way this place was filthy, dirty.. I'm still pretty upset about this and am hungry as we just came home mad.  Gawd I hate bad service!

Was up all night with some sort of tummy bug. Finally at 3am I couldn't stand it a second longer. Uhg!  Try finding a place that sells Pepto, in Scottsdale, open past 10pm.. good luck. Fortunately this is the only Walgreen's even remotely close to where I live that's open 24 hours a day.   Let me warn you though, at 3am there are loads of freaky people! So, keep to yourself, get what you need and get out.

What is up with yummy places closing at 8pm?! Chicago Burger Co and now El Molino! Instant star loss for early closures!  Though that'll be the only star loss.. the food here is fresh, home made and tasty! They make the best green chile in Old Town!   Cheap, tasty and friendly always has a place in my heart!

After eating Mexican food for a week solid the first thing we craved as soon as we got back to the US was PIZZA! Joe's NY is me and the Mr old reliable. We count on Joe's for some of the best pizza in town. Now they are even better, they deliver!!!   We always order the same thing.. large pie with meatball and basil! You cant go wrong.. the crust is slightly chewy with a nice crisp edge.. plenty of meatballs and the large is pretty darn big and under 20 bucks!   Eat at Joe's!

I'm not sure what happened but this place went downhill fast!! Ordered a pizza last night with sausage, cheese and fresh basil.. the baked the fucking basil so it turned black and nasty.. the sausage tasted like it was on the verge of spoiling, very gamy!! Plus the older woman behind the counter was not pleasant at all.. where is the old man, I miss his surly service and his killer pies!

Simply awesome! Best Asian food in the area. The service is spot on and extremely friendly. Tottie makes it a point to visit each and every table to make sure everything tastes good and is well done.   The Tottie rolls are to die for and are a must have when going here. I was craving Sweet and Sour Pork, I know lame huh, so I ordered her version.. its just the classic deep friend goodness tossed with fresh pineapple, carrots and onions. Reminded of me Shea Garden my mother used to take us too when we were wee lads.  For dessert we had the Rocky Road ice cream, awesome! She used coconut milk instead of regular milk.. super creamy and delicious. Also tried this pumpkin custard that was so smooth and refreshing.   Of course everything is fresh and home made.. family owned and operated.. this is just a great Asian restaurant. Next time I'm going to try the pho!

This place was so bad on so many levels I'm not even sure where to begin. Our server kept calling me honey.. and seemed to be in such a hurry she wouldn't stop and listen to me. You know how needy I can get and need to be listened too and heard. We started by ordering the Baked Spinach and Artichoke Dip..  what I couldn't understand is 1, how did the chef let this go out and 2, no one but us could smell the scorched burnt smoke coming off the dish. This thing was so badly burned and scorched it was completely inedible. Sent it back and she didn't even offer to bring another one. Perhaps it was because they were so busy they just wanted the food to go out?  So I ordered their Famous BBQ Ribs.. I hate complaining to much but these were old ribs.. maybe maybe a day or 2 before.. pork takes on a funky taste when its fridged for to long.. the texture of the meat (when you could find any) was like jerky. I happily ate my Creamed Spinach (2 star yummy) and didn't eat more then 2 bones of the ribs. When the waitress came to clear the plates (she never checked on us) she asked if I was full. I told her that the ribs weren't to my liking.. she smiled and asked if I wanted dessert.   Over all I would never come back to Don and Charlie's.. aside from the  Creamed Spinach, which I can make myself, there weren't many redeeming qualities. A shame too because it's so close to the house. I don't get it because the Yelps are so good. Maybe they were having  a bad night? It was so bad I wouldn't ever go back to find out.

The waiters are pretty hot.. well not all of them but many.. the food is so so.. service, if I had bigger boobs I think the service would have been better.. would not return.. I wake up to a hot man every morning so I have no worries about checking the waiters out again.

This is my weekly shopping place.. amidst loads of blue hair and a tight fit for this big bear I have to say I just love this place! My weekly food budget is usually around 50 bucks (it's just the 2 of us and we eat out way to much) and I always leave with loads of yummy items! I'd spend twice this at Wild Oats quite easily.   There are some checkers there that are very easy on the eyes! Always a plus in my book!! Each week holds many surprises for me and our menu.. always look forward to shopping here!!

Don and the team at Soundwerks are the best! They custom installed XM into my car.. oh they treated my car like it was there own! You cant see any wires or the XM antenna.. Don is a great communicator and is upfront about how long it will take and how much it will cost you. They also custom installed a Pioneer Nav system into the Mr's vehicle.. they did what the dealer said couldn't be done.. it looks awesome!!   I cant give a price range because it just depends on what you want.. this is custom audio which is very cool!! Just remember you get what you pay for!

Don and his team were at it again! This time it was another phase of awesomeness on my Cooper! They installed a custom bass unit that looks completely factory.. the sound is completely amazing and you would have thought that it came off the line with this system already installed.  Another great job, woohoo!!

So before McCormick Ranch opened this was my morning hangout.. Id get there about 3am to get my work out done before work and of course the crowds. The night guy was apparently friends with all the Scottsdale homeless (yes there are homeless in Scottsdale) so he would kindly let them in to take showers and such. Well, I think that's a cool thing to do however many homeless people have mental problems and do not discriminate on who they flip out on, including yours truly! I was putting my bag away when some homeless asshole came out of the shower area and proceeded to yell at me! I couldn't understand what he was saying (like had had marbles in his mouth) but he was animate about something.. when I finally had enough and turned around to call the cops he started apologizing.. jackoff!   Okay, so whatever, I went and did my work out.. then I came back to the locker room and stripped to take shower... when I got to my favorite stall (creature of habit) someone had taken a huge fucking shit right there in the shower stall! Can you fucking believe it? Though it was a perfect shit pile, kind of like when you pour soft serve ice cream into a bowl.. I was so grossed out I took a whores bath in another area and left. On my way out I told front desk guy what had happened there.. he looked at me and asked if I was sure.. how fucking sure can a turd in the shower stall be? Its pretty damn real! He looked at me like I did it or something. Jackoff number 2!  This place is like a 100 dollar whore.. she looks pretty good on the outside but once you go down on her, you really wish you hadn't.

Number 18 baby! 2 carne asada burritos with rice and beans! Me and the Mr will share that plus a cheese quesadilla.. super friendly drive thru service on the cheap! Many notches above your standard 'Berto's fare.. here the ingredients seem of better quality plus my ass doesn't hurt the next day! Can't go wrong here!

Spring is in the air and there is no better time to get your herbs and veggies planted for the summer harvest. So after last years heirloom tomato disaster we decided to do something with a yield, so Harper's it is.   Close to the house, locally own, well priced, friendly and great selection. While they do not stock heirloom varieties, we did find some nice beefsteaks that so far have about a dozen fruits growing on them.   Can not wait to see how many we get!! Yummy pico de gallo, BLT, caprese, salted, chopped and loved!

Recently I received word that my favorite Middle Eastern restaurant Alladin's Kitchen closed its doors. This was, at least for me, the best place to get your Mediterranean fix including some of the tastiest stuffed grape leaves around. I can go on and on about how much I loved Alladin's but alas, I have to pick myself up and rise above this terrible loss.   When a door closes a window opens and that window lead me right into the kitchen of Haji Baba. Situated along Apache Blvd in Tempe this spot is half restaurant and half Middle Eastern market and bakery, talk about a one stop shop. Upon entering, please feel free to seat yourself. On my visit there were menus already at each empty table.   Scanning the menu the first thing I noticed was the Abali Yogurt Soda ($1.69). Having never tried this I was quick to get a glass full though the waiter seemed hesitant to bring it. Let's just say after the first sip yogurt soda is an acquired taste. While I liked the yogurt sourness the saltiness of the soda was way too much. Fortunately the waiter was observant and brought over a glass of iced water by his own accord. I have to tell you that the service here is attentive and friendly.   The occasional juvenile in me snickered when I read the first item on the menu, Homos Tahini ($2.29), how appropriate. Joking aside, this was a beautiful puree of chickpeas, tahini or sesame seed paste, lemon juice and garlic. Usually this is served super garlicky elsewhere I was delighted to find this version to be well balanced and flavorful. Getting the same treatment as the homos, the Babaghanooj ($2.99) contains roasted eggplant instead of chickpeas. Both were dressed with olive oil and adorned with pickles and olives, were wishing for a glass of wine to compliment the appetizers, but they serve no liquor here.  Made from a mixture of fava beans and chickpeas, then pressed into patties and deep fried, the filling of the Falafil Sandwich ($2.69) was crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside. The warm pita bread and the fresh lettuce and tomato made for really good eats, a must.  Kabob Koubideh ($7.49) sounds like quite a mouthful and let me tell you this, it was. Pounded ground meat marinated in onion juice, and then grilled to a juicy smoky excellence. The meat reminded me of a Middle Eastern take on chopped steak, sublimely tender. Along side was a huge pile of super light basmati rice, fresh hot pita and creamy yogurt salad. A sprinkling of sumac over the entire plate adds a slight sourness, which melds incredibly well with this type of food.   Desserts are pretty much limited to Baklava ($1.29), but after such an amazing meal it was a real surprise that the sweet ending was a real disappointment. The nuts in each all tasted old with a slightly bitter rancidity to them. Selections ranged from pistachio, cashew and walnut with the later being the best, using the word "best" loosely.   With meager prices, generous portions and outstanding service, Haji Baba will definitely begin to fill the void in my heart and my tummy.

LOVE the pizza here. It reminds me of being that fat little kid who loves pepperoni pizza, you know the one.. he's got pizza sauce all over his face and doesnt care what anyone else thinks!   Now that I'm a fat little man, I still get the same pleasure out of the pizza at Spinato's, you know the pleasure.. you've got pizza sauce all over your face and you don't care what anyone else thinks!

This used to be my go-to pizza place back when I lived west side. Though on occasion we get pizza from there on our way to Surprise to visit by bff and its still just as awesome as I remember it.   Seriously, this is not pizza for the faint of heart. Super thick, inverted topping pizza that's so tasty and so filling we dubbed it "gut bomb" since one slice will pretty much do you. Yes, the pizzas are that huge and dense!   Beware though, the location is definitely iffy, so watch your back. However some places are worth the risk.

The place has history and is family owned.. both great but does the food have to taste like its been there since the place opened 60 years ago? The salsa's were all pretty lame.. 3 in total which they charge you if you want refills. There are 2 reds and one green.. one of the reds is little more then tomato sauce with some oregano in it. The 2nd red is a chunky salsa where all you can taste is garlic. The green is their 'spicy' salsa but its slimy consistency failed to burn or taste good.   The cheese crisp me and my mother shared was pretty darn good! I wish though we would have cut our losses there. The problem is the little weird things they do to their food and sauces. The beans have this strange after taste that I could not decipher.. the red sauce had a similar weird after taste, like I dunno, old. The tamale was covered in the red sauce but the weird old taste covered up what was probably a decent enough tamale. Do they put ground clove in their masa? Like I said, its those weird little touches that didn't appeal to me about this place.   Service was friendly and the place quaint.. however with the weird touches and so so salsa I probably wont go back. Very, very disappointing coming from a real food landmark!

You know how you go to a place for the first time and its totally awesome.. then you go back sometime later and the experience is not as good then the first.. thats Rio Mirage in El Mirage, AZ.  The first time we stopped in this place was awesome! They had the yummiest rice and beans.. as well as very good chimi's enchiladas etc.. but since the first time we've been there it just hasn't been as good.. the rice dry and greasy.. the beans, run of the mill.. food being burnt and greasy, greasy, greasy.. spotty service and in my opinion sub par ingredients make this place now an avoid.. what a shame too since they had so much going for them. Very disappointing.

As part of our welcome to Vegas junk mail I spotted a coupon from BB&B for 20% off your entire order, wow, sweet! Since we lost a few things in the move I figured it was a shopping coincidence and you should *never* ignore those, ever.  They have a great selection of housewares but when did they become so cluttered? I would hate to be in this place if there was a fire. The aisles and walkways are way to small and being the beefy guy that I am I swear I was going to break something.  While they might be cluttered but they have pretty much anything you'd need. I was in need of a blender and a cocktail shaker (I know where my priorities are). They've got loads to choose from, almost to many. On the spot I pulled up the Amazon app on my smartphone and started price comparing. BB&B had the better price even before the coupon. Yes I know that Amazon doesn't charge sales tax but remember sales tax helps your state. So I ended up buying both, yeah!  BB&B also has a great return policy. The blender didn't meet my satisfaction so I decided to exchange it for something a bit more powerful. You probably wont believe this but my kitty ate my receipt. He has a thing for small bits of paper. Anyhoo.. they swiped my debit card which pulled up the transaction, yes! I was able to get a different blender and was out the door in minutes. As for the cocktail shaker, Im still putting it through its paces.

The LV Monorail is awesome! Drops you off right in front of the LV Convention Center.. super convenient for trade shows and for getting around without paying a ton of money for cab fares.   I never call out anyone in a Yelp but Dave B must be talking about another city. This literally drops you off in front of the South Hall at the LV Convention Center. If you get off on the next stop at the Hilton you can get to the North Hall through the Hilton, ALL AIR CONDITIONED. Have you ever tried to park at the convention center? Good luck leaving around 5pm and getting back to your hotel in under an hour!

Okay had the BBQ at Ellis Island.. The BBQ place has its own space and is not part of the cafe. It's located right next to the sports book. I feel like it should have its own space here on Yelp since it would be like reviewing Wicked Spoon under the Cosmopolitan business listing. It's located at Ellis Island but its a separate restaurant.  Anyways..   The BBQ meats are ribs and chicken only, no choice of sides tho you do get beans, cole slaw, corn on the cob and garlic French bread with every entree. Ellis Island does have a brewery which means 20oz beers for cheap. Entrees are super reasonable and don't worry a combo rib and chicken platter will fill the heartiest of eaters and at these prices go ahead order an extra one entree to go.   I was pretty blown away.. The meats were incredibly juicy, tender and tasted like the most awesome back yard BBQ. The chicken was like eating meat silk, you hardly even needed to chew since it was that soft. Ribs were meaty and just barely clung to the bone (thats a good sign for BBQ). I'd have a hard time only choosing one meat as they both were pretty dang tasty! I love the sauce too, smokey and not overly sweet!   Whoa! I still have BBQ sauce in my beard, nom!

This is my first foray into Indian cooking here in Las Vegas. So I have to say Im very impressed with the scope of the menu as with the freshness and flavors of the dishes.  Service was alright, not particularly friendly but efficient none the less though there was an older woman bringing out the dishes, she was amazing! I think she may have been one of the owners. Just amazingly warm and friendly, wish she was our server the whole time.  The tvs and sound system were playing Bollywood music videos which was pretty fun! They do have a full bar! Oh and be sure to check in, we got a free mango lassi.   On to the dishes..  Chicken Tikka - Moist, fragrant, flavorful and oh so tender!  Chicken Tikka Masala - Big bold flavors, creamy and again insanely tender.  Malai Kofta - Similar to the Chicken Masala though not as spicy. Balls of cheese and vegetable sitting in a thick creamy gravy.   Garlic Naan - Lightly crisp with a nice chew this complimented our dishes with the ability to scoop up the amazing sauces.   Basmati Rice - Another amazing vehicle for the more gravy laden dishes.   We'll be back!

We stopped by last night to check out the McRib so this review is for that. I can honestly say that the McRib is McGross. The sauce cloyingly sweet, the meat had the texture of a sponge and after a couple bites I threw it out. Im not quite sure that the big deal is about with this sandwich. I do remember having one as a kid but like Twinkies somethings just taste better when you're young.   The staff here was really friendly and while the sandwich was gross, it was served hot and fresh.

After so many trips back and forth to Phoenix, for the move to Vegas, my car was pretty dang filthy and needed some much needed attention. I ended up choosing the best car wash as well as the hand wax. While it took around 40 minutes let me tell you that what they did was so worth the wait. My car looked new again and smelled so good inside I wanted to curl up on the back seat and let the cleanliness of my car envelope me. Yes, I love a clean car!   Is it me or does your seem to even run better after a good car wash? I know if my car had a mouth she would be smiling.   I love you Regency!

You know it has to be pretty special for me to give a place 5 stars. Pizzeria Bianco is pretty gawd damn special.. this man is neurotic, I mean passionate about his toppings and ingredients. I have always had deliciousness and consistency from him and his place.   Well worth the chill time before hand.. it is everything and some. It don't get much better then this for this style of artisan pizza.

The vendors were visiting from Arkansas and had never heard of Bianco's. Both were completely blown away by several things.. one was the wait from hell.. 3 hours to be exact.. 3 hours to the minute.. when they tell you how long they aren't stretching the truth by any means.. the next thing was the charm and personality both the pizzeria and the bar next door have.. this is SO Phoenix I told them. Lastly they were both toe curled over the pizza (I was too).. it was like the 3 of us shared some sort of foodie orgasm at the same time, I thought I was going to need to have a cigarette afterward!  At the end of the day Bianco's is just pizza.. but its pizza worth waiting for.

La Quercia Prosciutto.. last night was me and Beth's "Anniversary" (yep, this gurl used to be married) so we all decided to go to Pizzeria Bianco.. besides being some of the best pizza Ive ever had, he also has a side of the La Quercia Prosciutto.. we tried that at Luques in LA but it failed to impress. I went ahead and ordered a side of it and let me tell you what, it was the best prosciutto Ive ever had.. it literally just melted in your mouth! I couldn't believe it, just simply off the fucking chart tasty!   I'm on the website now trying to decide what to order!!  69 bucks for three different styles at 3lbs each, shipping included..  http://www.laquercia.us/  Chris Bianco has such great taste.. I still have a chef crush on him!

Okay, while I love Chris and I love his product I despise their group reservation policy. We called weeks ago for a reservation for 9 towards the end of May, they told me that we need to call one month to the date at 5 o'clock.. so today that call was made at 5 o'clock, the stupid matter of factly bitch told me that the reservations were gone at 4:30.. okay, if you're going to fuck around with the way you do things that's one thing, but being a dumb bitch about it is completely another.   I think I'm finally over my love for this place.. I mean 3 weeks ago we showed up and was told the wait was 4.5 hours.. I don't wait that long for pizza.. while his pizza is great, its just fucking pizza.  Advice: get a bigger place!!  Sorry but I'm still fuming mad!!

I've never written about him before, I have a gay father. Well, technically he's not my real father but a man who I met some years ago. Coming out for me was pretty tough, married, house in the suburbs and a wife who I loved deeply. After coming out to her, my family and friends, my therapist suggested I quickly join an online support group for married gay men, and that's where I met Larry Johnson. A kind older man, Larry immediately took me under his wing; living in San Francisco it was easy for him to show me more about our mutual passion, food.    Over the years we've exchanged thousands of emails and I've visited him in SF as often as I could, Larry taught me a great deal about fine dining. Including how to have food adventures and about getting the most out of life's pleasures. While my mom will always be my first food hero, Larry will always be my gay dad and has helped to make me who I am today.   So when he comes into town for a visit I'm always a little stressed out about where to take him for dinner. This visit was easy, I decided to choose something basic and straight forward like steak. Opened 60 years ago, Durant's is not only a Phoenix institution but is also a great steakhouse. While the trend of new steakhouses in the Valley has finally started to taper off, Durant's classic approach is commendable and endearing. I'm talking about fantastically tender steak, understandable sides and professional service.   Steakhouses in general are probably some of the most expensive restaurants in town. So I was ready to spend a mint on dinner but did notice one thing at Durant's, the steaks aren't ala carte. This means when you order a steak you're not only getting soup or salad but you're also getting your choice of accompaniment, what a value.  Entering Durant's from the rear will take you right through the kitchen, dont worry about this, its all part of the charm. You'll see that the kitchen is spotless and most of the cooks turn around and give you a warm smile and a happy hello. Once you get into the dining room its all old school. Black leather booths, crushed red velour wallpaper and dim lighting all set the mood for a relaxed and subdued dinner experience.   Ordering the 16 oz Ribeye Steak ($39.50) was an easy choice for most steak lovers. The ribeye for has the perfect amount of marbling to meat ratio, this means that the meat will be really flavorful without being too fatty. I have to tell you, the ribeye at Durant's was one of the best steaks I've had in years. This thick juicy steak was everything that a steak should be, slightly salty with a distinct smoky char and perfectly tender. I also upgraded my side to the Stuffed Baked Potato ($4.95), think twice baked potato.   Larry's 8oz New York Strip ($29.50) and loaded baked potato were delivered. Not only was the steak perfectly seasoned, it was expertly cooked at medium-rare as requested.   A silence fell over the table as we enjoyed our meals together. Durant's not only impressed me and me made look good, but they made me proud of our restaurant heritage here in Phoenix. Durant's, thank you.

As I'm sitting here this morning casting my Zagat votes I cant help but feel underwhelmed by the selections on their "Arizona's Top Restaurants" I cant help but wonder why some of these places are on here. Is Barrio Cafe really the best of? For me, I think not.  We went with about 6 friends so we were able to try many things on the menu. However nothing even remotely stood out. Oh yes something did, the loud dining room. It was so loud we were literally shouting at one another from across the table. I love to talk over dinner so my throat was pretty hoarse afterwards.. ah yes, the waiter was a very nice looking man and was super flirty with all of us.. he got a big tip.  Otherwise I scratch my head and wonder why so many people gush over this place? Its not bad, its just blah.

So the salsa has way to much black pepper.. the service isn't always friendly.. but the list of tequila's is TDF! I generally frequent this place for a cheap yummy lunch, green chile Navajo taco, and is super close to work.. nothing like tying one on at lunch time to make the rest of the afternoon smooth by.. just kidding, I never do that!

The salsa is so hot that you'll be hating life the next day with a burning chocolate starfish. Waiters are jerky and the food is way to salty.. I think they want you to buy more of their over priced drinks!  They lost the Mr.'s Amex on the last visit and got really bitchy with him because he was upset. Ended up calling Amex and reporting the card stolen and didn't pay for dinner. With that we will never return. However up to that point we had always had a good time there even though its mediocre at best.

We've been eating at LOS for years and have been there so many times that luckily we've managed to order most of the menu. However we have 2 different ways we order when visiting LOS. The first way is just me and my hubs on a casual weeknight, we tend to order the few dishes that we haven't tried yet . The other is a weekend night with several guests along for a Thai feast. So this review will focus on the later, a sort of best of LOS if you will.  On a side note you do not come here to order Pad Thai and the other super popular Thai dishes. LOS is famous for Northern style and Chef Chutima specialties, stick to those and you will not be disappointed. Also, LOS has 4 condiments but be sure to ask for all 4.. chili paste, chili powder, pickled jalape√±o will be brought out in a caddy but the 4th is separate.. its thai chili in fish sauce and lime juice, you'll have to ask for this one. When they bring it lift the lid of carefully and inhale the fragrance. This to me is the LOS perfume and let me tell you this condiment is scorchingly hot. Its burns both ways but it tastes truly amazing!   Apps..  #12 Stuffed Chicken Wings.. while these can be found elsewhere, the preparation here is a deep fried crunchy version that's amazing with pickled jalape√±o and sticky rice.   #13 A. Nua Dad Deaw which is Issan style beef jerky. Seriously, it's jerky so think deeply flavored slices of chewy meat. Its fun to eat especially with sticky rice and some of the accompanied sauce.   #14 Nam Kao Tod.. this is like the premier LOS appetizer, if you can order only one app, make it this one. We call this one simply crispy rice with sour sausage. However its the little pieces of sausage arent sour but have a porky lime flavor thats addictive paired with fresh ginger, green onions, chili, peanuts and of course this is all nestled into a pile of light crispy rice. Served with cucumber chips this tastes great using the chili fish sauce condiment. BTW, if you prefer the sausage whole order #66.  Salads..  #45 Crispy Catfish Pieces Salad.. little deep friend pieces of cat fish with slices of apple and peanuts then dressed with lime juice.. Its bright, crispy and one of my favorites here.   #59 Koi Soy.. okay so technically this isn't a salad but the coolness of this dish sits perfectly in the salad space for me. So what is it you ask? It's Issan style beef tartare. Yep raw beef and its a gorgeous dish with minced beef dressed with chili, rice powder and lime. We've ordered this at a spice level 4 and let me say that our faces felt like they were going to burn off. Order at a 1 spice level and add your own heat via condiments. Trust me on this.  Entrees..  A. Khao Soi.. typical street food noodle dish but the version here is crazy good. We always order beef with this but if you're feeling like a high roller get the beef short rib version (you'll pay more but its marginally more tender). Its simple, toothsome egg noodles afloat in a curried coconut bream broth garnished with red onion, lime and pickled cabbage. Its rich, thick and a must order.   K. Kang Hung Lay (Pork Stew Northern Curry).. this is one of those dishes that has a far reaching flavor profile. To me this curry could easily be on a table in India.. its dark deep pork richness is fork tender and perfect over steamed rice. However many prefer to eat this one with sticky rice.   Drunken Noodles.. we order this a couple of different ways depending on what the table wants.. most popular way is Drunken Noodle with Crispy Sea Bass with extra noodle. The sea bass is lightly dusted and deep fried until its light and crispy. Inside the meat is light, flakey and a great contrast to the rich smokey noodles. The other preparation for us is Drunken Noodle with Crispy Duck. Same as above but with slices of deep fried duck breast (no bones in either). The duck is rich, slightly fatty and bursting with flavor. For me the duck is my favorite preparation but I also like heavier meat flavors.   Garlic Prawns.. so for the longest time we never ordered this dish as we thought it was just a Chinese style dish, boy were we wrong. This is where Chef Chutima works her Thai culinary magic. She takes large shell on shrimp and cooks them in such a way that the meat is tender and juicy while the shell is as light and crispy as a potato chip. Yes, you eat the shell, legs and all. This is truly a magical dish for us.   Dessert..   We're usually so full right about now that desserts of sticky rice and mango seems just to heavy for us. Though look up my review for Luv-It Frozen Custard for a tongue cooling treat (its close to LOS).  At some point in the future I will write a companion review to this review for those who want to explore other dishes but have been overwhelmed with the scale of the menu. Oh and in case you're wondering the amount of dishes we ordered above are good for about 4-6 people. Though we're really big eaters so a party of 4 is more like it for us.   Bon appetite!

Ive never been a fan of this place but some friends were going there and invited us to come with them.. what the hell, right?  The service is pretty good here.. very attentive and friendly. Ordered the spinach salad, the dressing was really weird, like a miso dressing with bacon.. didn't work at all. Also ordered a Frisco pizza, thin crust. Well the outer perimeter of the pizza was so dried out that those pieces were just about inedible. Maybe that's how they do it here? I don't remember the pizza's being that dry? The wings were good enough.. plenty of meat and not greasy at all.   I wouldn't go come back to Oregano's unless some friends were going and I was invited. You would have been proud of me, I didn't complain at all!!

I belong to their Reel Access Club so me and the Mr get some great deals from here.. this last time was 79 weekend and 59 weekday a night.. for the quality of the hotel to some of the best places on the strip to eat its a real treat staying here. Plus going to the LV Convention Center is a cinch with the monorail. I wouldn't stay anywhere else but here when I'm working at the convention center.   Be sure to get Grand Tower rooms.. the West Wing rooms bathrooms are way to small!

This is hardly a great French restaurant.. I would say its mostly a tourist trap with mediocre food that is severely over priced for the quality. The service and view were decent enough but the food quality was pretty bad.  Me and the Mr took his elderly Aunt and Uncle there so it was more about family then the food which in this case was a good thing.  I still like the name though.. has a special ring to it!

You know over the course of several years Ive revisited Mon Ami on several occasions and each time has gotten better than the last. I used to laughingly refer to Mon Ami as the Olive Garden of French restaurants, homogenized versions of French bistro classics. But as I grow older and (hopefully) wiser Ive found that this isn't really the case. Yes this is a chain but they do try to do their best with what they do. I re-read my previous review (2008) and wow did I just sound like an arrogant dick. I apologize for that and sure I could delete it but think its much better left to show a contrast of me growing up.   Now with all that being said, I have to say that I always crave their ribeye steak slathered in deliciously sweet bordelaise sauce when we visit. This is Vegas and there are loads of steakhouses pretty much everywhere but for the price point this steak is a great value as well as a great taste! Its slightly fatty, beefy richness is cooked exactly how I love it, medium rare. This IMHO is the only steak on the menu to order. While the lesser priced steaks are alright its only a few bucks more for the ribeye.   If you haven't tried it, the goat cheese and tomato sauce appetizer is super tasty. Creamy goat cheese melts into the tomato sauce fortifying it with amazing flavor. It comes with a slab of garlic butter soaked bread which is kind of greasy so I opted for hot fresh baguette. The fris√©e, kale and bacon salad make for an awesome salad that's covered with a single poached egg. You know you can put warmed egg yolks on anything and it'll taste good. The dressing is nicely acid with a slight sweetness that cuts the bacon and egg richness. So good.  Who knows, maybe my supposed standards have gone down or perhaps, just perhaps, good food is just good food no matter where it comes from. Regardless of the case one (me) doesn't need to act like an arrogant bitch about it.

Went for the Summer Taste Menu.. you know what? It just doesn't get any better than this for me. Its comforting, accessible, honest, delicious and comfortable. From the space to the food its all with in access. Not fussy or pretentious as some other places are on the strip or in the MGM.. just real food well prepared and well seasoned in a relaxing atmosphere.

Aside from a very loud dining room, it doesn't get much better then this! Its the perfect combination of great comforting food, fresh ingredients and a warm cozy atmosphere. Oh how I love this place.  Try to stick with the specials if you can.. both we tried, Scallops and Lamb Shank were absolutely perfect!   Oh how I love me some warm nuts!

I'm sitting here just perplexed! I cant believe I haven't Yelped about Chino until now! Ive been coming here for years and years since its so close to my work.. what have I been smoking?!   I don't have much to add but this.. chile relleno burrito.. you've never had a gut bomb until you've tried this one! Cheese stuffed into a green chile.. battered in crumbs then deep fried until hot and crispy then it's wrapped into a tortilla with more melted cheese.. who knew you could pack so much goodness into a burrito?! Mmm, goodness!

Essential the same scene over and over again with an ABBA song thrown in there for good measure. Was a frustrating show to watch as the characters fear of confrontation was evident in every scene. I'm wondering how this is a "smash hit"?  If you HAVE to check it out go to Goldstar.com.. you can get discount tickets there.

Okay so Ive been glum the past few days as I have an impending birthday. Every year this time I get all down in the dumps.. not that I'm not happy with my life cause life is good. Its more like getting further away from my youth and closer to being well, old. All of my grandparents were crotchety, sourpuss drama queens.. is that my fate? Can I break the mold or am I to going to be a crotchety sourpuss?  So as I contemplate and figure out what I'm going to do with my birthday baggage I decide to squash it with food. All weekend Ive been eating out and having a good time. This is one of the few times outside of a vacation where I will live it completely and to the near of sheer gluttony. So why not dim sum?   Ive chowed much dim sum in my 36 years of earthen wear.. of course some good and some bad. I have never been to a place where every dish was great.. Golden Buddha is no exception to this.. they do the basics well enough and have enough funky cool Asian style to keep me interested in returning. The carts around 1130 flow well but around noon it' s full blown freeway action! In fact there might be some road kill in there based on some of the looks on that last steam cart..   Me and 3 others who were feeling my pain ordered 14, count them, 14 different dishes. One of my friends is from Georgia and had never had dim sum but he is so courageous and unflinching that he was just a blast. Just the shot in the arm to get me out of my funk. I remember the first time I had dim sum.. my eyes wide open, nostrils flared and excited to see what was under the next steamer lid. That was him today.. one exciting thing after the next.. he was even willing to try chicken feet but this is one of those dishes not done very well here.   My friend took me back to a time where I was younger and less experienced. He looked up to me to guide him through the noodles, bao and sui mai.. like a big brother.. I'm privileged that I could show him something new and exciting and he was so into it! So instead of feeling sorry for myself I felt experienced and useful.. that there is something I can give back to others.. that its not all about me and me aging but about what can be shared with others.  There is so much more to do, give and feel in this short time we are here.. and Ill do it to, one bite at a time.

Who doesn't enjoy a lazy Sunday morning? I love spending time leisurely reading the Sunday news while getting caught up on a weeks worth of cooking shows. After a few hours hunger finally sets in and its time to find something cheap and easy. While that might sound more like a lifestyle choice than a way of eating, cheap and easy to me means dim sum, and lots of it. With a fistful of cash and my growing appetite I head over to my default dim sum house, Golden Buddha.   Located in the Chinese Cultural Center, Golden Buddha has been pushing carts every weekend for the past few years. Over those years they've become a destination for steamy delights and have built quite a following with groups usually packing the lobby. Here's some advice, for a lesser selection with no waiting, go early. If you want more selection and don't mind the wait, go after noon.   Ranging in price from $2.35-$6.50, Golden Buddha pretty much offers mainstream selections from dumplings and chicken feet to rice and noodles. Most of the cart pushers don't speak much English but know this; most items are either made with pork or shrimp.   Within minutes of being sat the first smiling server rolls up her cart and begins pimping her wares. As she lifts the steel lid from the first steam basket, the mist dissipates to reveal 3 white fluffy hidden treasures beneath. Know as char siu bao, or steamed BBQ pork buns, these are pretty standard for any dim sum brunch. Pulling apart one of the doughy pillows reveals its sweet porky center, add some chile oil for added depth. Probably the most typical offering is the pork dumplings or sui mai, a wonton wrapper filled with ground pork and black mushrooms. These meaty bites have an enjoyable earthiness that left me wanting to ask for another basket.  The next cart to come along is absolutely filled with fried items. I love the crispy crunch of egg rolls and while the GB version was crisp, the inside was filled with oil that tasted like last nights fish. After only a single bite the rest remained untouched. Seemingly fried in the same oil, the salt and pepper shrimp were not only super fishy but the shells were also left on. Shell on shrimp isn't usually a problem when the shrimp in question is cooked really well. Not the case with these, they were ruined before they even hit the table, greasy and salty.  On a lighter note, wrapped in translucent rice paper, the spring rolls were large, filled with chewy rice noodles and 3 plump shrimp, unfortunately these were also flavorless.   A new one for me was the Zhaliang, a long tubular Chinese doughnut that is tightly cocooned in a sheet of rice noodle. The end result is more about texture than bold flavor; I can see how so many people seek these out for breakfast being chewy and crispy at the same time.   Dim sum brunch isn't complete without at least one Chinese dessert. Pointing at a plate of pineapple buns or bo lo yau from the dessert cart, these pastries actually contain no pineapple. Instead the name refers to its crunchy checkered top crust. Inside the bun you'll get a sweet surprise of satisfyingly sweet custard filling.  While I left satisfied, overall Golden Buddha doesn't quite have the chops they used to, but in a pinch or on a lazy Sunday morning, they'll do just fine.

Let me tell you about Cibo..  We went last night after seeing Kathy Griffin so we were both in dazzeling moods having laughed all night.. well leave to someone to suck the good out of your mood right quick.  We arrived at Cibo right at 10, they close at 11. The usual host and hostess sat next to the door chatting with some friends. The waiters were sitting at the large table in the front wrapping silverware and the bartender well he just ignored us completely. Finally one of the waiters asked if wanted a table.. no we would like to stand their and smell the pizza! Duh! So we asked him to hold one moment as we used the restroom real quick. Then when we came back he was gone and we were standing there once again being ignored. Finally the bartender made a huge sigh and asked of there were only 2 of us.. so he takes us to the left dining room and there are only 2 tables in there.. guess where he sat us.. right next to a couple that looked like they getting VERY romantic.. so they gave us crusty looks.. I then asked the bartender if we could just sit at the bar (I can appreciate someone wanting space, I didn't want to sit next to them either).. so he turns and looks to me, sighed again and said "if you want".. like those words were somehow causing his hair to fall out. So I said "Oh wait, I wouldn't want to put you out!".. he then just turned and stormed towards the bar.. the Mr stopped him and said never mind.. (he didn't want him waiting on us after that little episode) so we sat next to the couple.. they looked at us like we had just interrupted a marriage proposal and she hadn't quite answered yet.  So Im mad as all heck.. Ive been treated badly before but I gotta know you before you can walk all over me! Im SO over Cibo at this point and ready to leave but the Mr talked me into staying.. he has this special talent of calming the beast, not that I turn green and tear my clothes off or anything but my tongue has been known to be very sharp!   Waiter arrives takes our drink order.. nice wine list though very small.. he returns with the drinks and takes our dinner order.. antipasti, a rustica and a tricolore.. I asked if I could have prosciutto put on top.. you know what he says.. "Ill ask the chef if you can have that.. he doesn't like changing HIS pizza's".. I cocked my head at him (I think the vein in my forehead was ready explode) "he doesn't like to change his pizza's".. if you offer toppings on the menu for an up-charge, wouldn't you think they would actually give them to you? Talk about the dang pizza nazi! The waiter returns a few moments later or the 'chefs messenger'  (I think he was sweating) tells me that the chef has agreed to let me have the proccutio but only on a plate. Oh thank you thank you oh lord oh messiah!   Can you believe this place?  While the food was good the attitudes here has really put me off.. so the 2 stars are for food only.. the Mr and I will never come to this place again.. Cibo has officially been scratched from our minds. Oh, I will be sending this review to them as well.. that way if they even care, which I doubt, they will address not only the bartenders attitude (little scruffy guy) but the idea that the customer pays their light bill and tells all of their friends about the place!

This here is some good pizza! Had the 18" stuffed pizza and it was so damn good.. ate 2 pieces and have a completely full tummy.. also had some delicious wings and meatballs. Will certainly go here again.. great folks running this place too, super friendly!!  I remember a time where super friendly service was the norm not rarity as it has become. Kudos to Mamma Mia!!

..only 10 grams of carbs per slice? "No, only 10 carbs per 12" pizza!" SOLD!  Amazingly thin whole wheat crust covered in sauce, cheese and sausage ($5.95) and a shit load, 24, of buffalo wings ($9.95) made up our dinner tonight.. low carb load and maximum taste and value! The crust was lightly crunchy on the edges and chewy in the middle, love the different textures as you work through each bite.   The owner attests, he's lost 80lbs low carb'n.. instant motivation to continue and stay the course with low carb eating and living. Mamma Mia's, I love you!

Okay so to start with I am not a fan of buffets. Just something about touching spoons and surfaces that tons of other people have touched. I mean you cant verify that every guest has washed their hands or not so Id rather not take any chances. I do enjoy pre-plated options like Wicked Spoon though this buffet does not do this.   So slapping on the old feedbag I was pretty blown away but the sheer quantity and variety of the stations. Chinese, Mexican, American, Seafood, etc.. was crazy how much food there was. While I could go through all the items I tried like the tough and chewy prime rib and the off tasting salsas Id rather just say that this buffet is right on par with say a cruise ship buffet. The quality is only alright but for the price point of $30 I expected higher since the Wicked Spoon is high quality and only charges a few bucks more.   If you're expecting to be wowed just lower your expectations and Im sure you'll be fine. My expectation of anyone visiting a buffet, please wash your hands first.

There and back again..  We ventured this morning to a great land called Phoenix (though today we shall call that Gondor) from our little Scottsdale burrow (we shall call that the Shire). The Shire has many wonderful things to offer so we don't venture to far.   There's been talk of a movement in the great land of Gondor.. this movement is called Slow Food. Were great humans feed others based on sustainable crops, dairy and meat. These humans try to whenever possible, use only locally grown ingredients. There was word of an outdoor market that believes in these philosophies and shares with all the locals there. So off to Gondor.    After an easy and painless journey we arrived at the great outdoor market to find that it wasn't open yet. A very small distance east of there were a few humans mulling around a classic Gondor building that looked to have been turned into some sort of eatery. Once inside we discovered a great man named Matt and his magical Big Breakfast! We were seated at a counter with many other hungry travelers.   A fair maiden appeared.. she was so friendly and welcoming.. then took our orders.. the great man Matt had created something just for that day.. Salsa Verde Huevos Rancheros. The way the maiden pronounced these words we though for a moment she was speaking Elven.. only moments had passed and then set before us were 2 huge plates filled with roasted potatoes, 2 eggs over easy atop a corn tortilla covered in a green sauce. You see hobbits love good food, you can tell by their round bellies and lack of defined abs.. this was indeed a bountiful feast!  The fragrance arose from the plate and filled our nostrils.. we both stared into each others eyes then quickly began eating.. the flavors and textures were simply heavenly.. each better then the last!   We could see ourselves making the journey to Gondor quite often from the Shire.. we could see someday perhaps living in Gondor close to the outdoor market and of course the great Matt's Big Breakfast.

When growing up I loved to watch TV.  I was the chubby kid so going outside and playing wasn't much in my vocabulary as I was always taken away to a fantasyland of programming that would appeal to me so.  Inevitably you'd see reruns of all the beloved favorites, I Dream of Jeanie, Bewitched and Wild Wild West.  But there was one rerun that really caught my eye, Bonanza.  It's not that I liked Westerns or anything like that; it was because I loved looking at the cast.  Those tight jeans clad Cartwright brothers were the dreams of young raging hormones and many afternoons of happy time.    After happy time I would always be ready for something to eat.  Food would almost certainly ease the loneliness of growing up the chubby kid, where is that wall of man Hoss Cartwright when a kid needs a hug?  I know where he was at; probably back up at the ranch house making something to eat! Sierra Bonita Grill, it's like that ranch house.  Low hanging ceilings with exposed wooden rafters and a wonderfully smoky just used fireplace smell, you'd think those Cartwright brothers would saunter in at any moment.   Sierra Bonita is the sister restaurant of the fantastic Phoenix City Grille, which also seems to pay homage to Arizona and the old west with its styling and menu selections.  Sierra is just more into the cowboy thing with the sort of cowboy chic and down home friendliness but not enough to be cheesy and contrived.  Outdoors there is a wonderfully cozy patio area for complete with fans for the warmer evenings.  I'm looking forward to cooler temperatures later this year so I can bask in the glowing heat of their gorgeous fireplace.   There isn't much of a better way to get settled into your evening than with one of Sierra Bonita Fresh Squeezed Margaritas ($8).  These tart and heavily liquored versions will take the edge off of any bad day you might have been having.  I make a mean margarita at home so when I say I love these margaritas it really means a whole lot, it's the fresh juice!   After easing into your margarita, looking over the menu will be more of a challenge since everything sounds pretty good.  Like those Cartwright brothers, they sure make them big at Sierra Bonita. The portions are pretty large so be warned when ordering, big eaters will rejoice as I did when the first plates went down.   Fresh seems to be more of a way of life than simply a word.  The Guacamole ($9) embodies the word in its wonderful bright green color and just smashed taste.  If you've never had fresh guacamole before this version is a great way to bust your cherry, so to speak.  The accompanied 3 salsas were all very flavorful including a roasted chile flecked smoky salsa, a fresh chopped pico de gallo and a tangy tomatillo.  The large salty thick cut tortilla chips were sturdy and crisp enough to hold up to scooping chunks of avocado and tomato, scrumptious.   Mini Quesadillas ($7) are a plate of 3 small corn tortillas filled with spinach, cheese and huitlacoche.  The huitlacoche aka corn smut, is actually a fungus that grows on corn and is widely viewed as a delicacy, I think you either love or hate it.  The taste is earthy in a good mushroom kind of way but can tend to be slightly pungent.  In the case of the quesadillas, the flavor was indeed earthy and meshed very well with the other flavors.  Instead of salsa with the quesadilla, they have chosen to serve a delicious black bean and hominy relish.  It's the little choices that seem to make a difference when we're talking about food.   Tacos seem to be on pretty much every menu these days.  They are simple, tasty and easy to make, however all aren't created the same way.  Take the Carne Asada Tacos ($10) for example; the beef is prime and extremely tender though the real difference is the use of pesto mayo, salsa fresca, shredded cabbage and penela cheese for an interesting play on flavors.   When I took my first bite of the Buttermilk Chicken ($17) I was taken back to the time of being a kid and loving my mothers cooking.  Generously seasoned and sublimely tender this is some great chicken.  They lightly pan fry it then finish it in the oven so it's ever so lightly crispy but ever so heavenly.  Included is a pile of mashed sweet potatoes and asparagus spears all slathered in cracked peppercorn gravy just dreamy.     What's a cowboy place without something sweet to finish it all off?  Naturally there is Bread Pudding ($6) but the Buttermilk Pie ($7) seemed like the most unusual choice.  This gamble paid of in spades, the pie was choice! The texture reminded me of a cross between cheesecake and flan with the flavor being something like the later.  The pie is wadding in a pool of caramel sauce that tasted house made and with being so sweet, is meant to be shared.  One bite of the flaky crust and that may not happen.  If you ever have a hunkin' hankerin' for some down home cowboy chow, Sierra Bonita Grill will induce a feeling like happy time with the Cartwright brothers.

Youch! Waited for 30 minutes and the place wasn't even busy.. Slow service.. even slower kitchen.. pollo fundido was cold (un-melted cheese, stone cold chicken) and tasted like it had been in the fridge for a while! If the stove is broken or the dishwasher, whatever the problem, you really should communicate that to your guests.  The green pond in the back was kind of different..

Celebrated NYE here last night.. we all had a very good time.. cool decor, loads of eye candy and well priced comfort food, cant go wrong.. well mostly.  For whatever reason the waitress ordered all of our food at one so guess what? All the food came out at once.. I was pretty ticked off about this as the same thing happened at Cheesecake Factory (haven't been back, yuck!).. a place of this caliber sending out salads on top of entre's left me scratching my head. So my fillet sat there and got cold while I finished my salad.. sent it back. The chef came out (WOOF!) and talked to me about the timing which I thought was very cool.. he ended up making me a special plate of the most yummy braised lamb served with creamy grits.. both were awesome and I hate grits.. I was cleaning the plate with a fresh made dinner roll.. was great!!  The pastry chef made the entire table a sampling of desserts.. he makes lemon meringue pie just like mom.. plus being cute as a button.. well you know me, I'm a sucker for a chef!   If it weren't for the chef I would have banged this place badly due to the timing issue but his charisma and charm won me over.. well, actually it was the lamb!!

Clumsy space delightful food, horrible lame service.. hostess wasn't very nice and the waiter was forgetful and spacey though he was VERY cute.. what happens when cute runs out?  I actually wrote Lisa G an email describing the bad spacey service and told her the name of the server. She then informed me that was one of her best servers and I had to be mistaken! The only mistake here would be ever going back! She showed me, huh?!  Single star for food only.

After having a more then horrible expereince at the now closed Fiamma outlet here in Scottsdale, I was very paranoid about trying this place. Thye menu sounded so yummy I couldnt resist plus with a 25 buck dining credit, well at least it was discounted if it was bad.  Nothing could have been further from what happened here. Bright attentive wait staff.. super yummy well prepared and well presented food. Oh we had 5 apps and 2 entree's.. oh yeah.. portion size was good and the flavors were clean and accessible.  I will certainly go back and pay full price!

Tuesday night and you don't feel like cooking? Head over to YC's.. fresh and tasty on the cheap! It's so much fun to because YOU control almost every aspect of your bowl.. mine is usually so full its toppling onto the tray.. there are just enough choices to keep me interested in coming back next time thinking, I wonder how that'll taste?!

When my friends told me they were taking me to the 4 Seasons for breakfast I thought they were kidding. A 4 Seasons, on the strip? Who knew? A completely surprising and wonderful experience.   Be sure to have the Huevos Rancheros! The red sauce they prepare is so rich and creamy it would be probably make a fun dinner ice cream! I do ding them for using jarred salsa.. I'm sure that most of the cooks in the back have awesome salsa recipes.. the chef needs to hit them up, seriously! Also a ding on the so so pastry basket.. come on now.. this is the 4 Seasons.. I bet they could bring something better in than what they currently serve.  In all the chaos and drama on the strip this is one of the most secluded feeling and comfortable escapes. I look forward to coming back soon!

My girlfriend reserved the round table for us 2 months ago.. 2 months.. you'd think they would have had enough time to figure out how they were going to deal with it.. so what did they do? They gave our table away to another party, like minutes before we arrived. Needless to say my girlfriend was livid! She and I being like minded was livid as well. Though she's stronger then I am, I would have told them to fuck off and went somewhere else.. instead we chose to stick it out.. we got a booth for the 5 of us to cram into.. was very intimate. Nice really.  We all decided to have the summer taste menu which sounded good at the time. All I have to say is fussy, fussy, fussy! Super small haute cuisine portions, like one bite, seriously. Just completely over done and over thought.. a good plate doesn't need 10 components on it.. the fewer the components the more harmonious something works together..   Service was great though and the server even bought us a round of drinks since the ice princess at the front gave our table away. I'm not sure if I would go back here on my next trip.. this was a real disappointment.

Where else can you get a Chile Relleno wrapped in a tortilla to make a burrito? Super crunchy friend goodness with oozy melty cheese in every bite.. Oh the overkill and love every second of it!! Jen Red Pork in a quesadilla with a side of black beans and jerk fried rice.. this is some serious hybrid comfort food.. may sound strange but works very well! You'll leave super stuffed and change in your wallet from a $10!

Anytime is a good time for barbecue. The smell of burning wood, the sweet thick or vinegary sauces and meat that just fall off the bone -- these elements have mass appeal to my senses.  So it's probably no surprise that I've been to most Valley smokehouses to check out their goods.  My latest exploration, Bobby-Q, came after a day of bargain hunting at a clearance outlet at Metrocenter. So much shopping can work up an appetite, and you'll need an appetite since the prices at Bobby-Q are low and the portions are large.  The location might be familiar to many longtime Phoenicians -- it was Bobby McGee's until about five years ago. I have many fond memories eating there with my family as a kid.  While the building got a $3 million dollar makeover, the charm and coziness is intact. It's sort of a cowboy chic with dim lighting, stained concrete floors and a tin ceiling. The seating is comfortable and the service friendly and efficient. If you're in a hurry, you can call ahead; there is a separate entrance for to-go orders.  Everything on the menu is made in house, from the barbecue sauce to the fluffy corn bread. Being an avid home cook I can appreciate these extra steps.  Always wanting to try something new, the Q-Rolls ($7.50) are a take on a Mexican flauta. Filled and rolled with smoked beef brisket and then deep-fried to a golden brown, these looked better than they tasted. The roll's open ends allowed for far too much oil to penetrate the meaty interior, which ended up a tasteless crunch.  A steakhouse classic, the Wedge Salad ($5), is made with a quarter of crisp head lettuce, sprinkled with smoked bacon, chopped tomatoes and bleu cheese crumbles. I can never resist the power of blue cheese and bacon.  The menu includes entree-sized salads, sandwiches and steaks, but my focus was on smoked meats. You can order two or three meat platters, but I opted for the Whole Hog ($36), a choice of two ribs, two meats and three sides.  When the plate arrived, my eyes widened. Huge slabs of Baby Back Ribs and St. Louis-Style Ribs were framed by piles of pulled pork and beef brisket, it's quite the mother lode of meat, so be prepared to share with others.  Going straight to the ribs, I grabbed a bone and it immediately separated from the rib meat. The meat was melt-in-your -mouth tender, and rightly so; they cook their meats low and slow for about 20 hours.  With all of the meat loving going on, it's easy to forget the sides. The Mac 'n Cheese was creamy and gooey and was worth ordering again. Pecan Cole Slaw was good, but I especially liked the toasted pecans, hich provided a nice contrast. Roasted Corn comes topped with a few wheels of corn on the cob. I wish the entire dish were served this way, since the kernels were swimming in a pool of butter.  After finishing this feast, there couldn't possibly be room for Peach Cobbler ($6.50) or Mud Pie ($6.50). But it was a nice touch that the check was brought out with a small bag of hot fresh cinnamon and sugar-covered donuts.

This place just sucks! You know a room is complete without something from Ikea.. be it a unique lamp or cheap book shelf.. well that's how I used to feel. Now..  The layout of the store doesn't make any sense at all.. each time Ive been they've moved more stuff around making it even worse. However the store isn't nearly as bad as its customers! Now I might be a little disoriented when I'm at Ikea but come on.. some of these people are just completely lost and in the way. Also, if you're going to have kids, please put them in a leash or something.. I hate it when irresponsible parents let their kids just run a muck all over the place. There is a place downstairs to house the children while the parents shop.. they need to make the sign larger or something cause my last visit there were kids for days and always in the way.   Fuck, I'm ranting.. need to take some deep cleansing breaths!

OMG! I cant believe I waited this long to go here! I was thinking it was going to be just some little store.. this place is huge, well for a spice store. They are well focused and of great quality! The staff is so friendly and helpful.. I did get to bash them both as neither had tried the Buttermilk Ranch mix!   They were closing for the night so I didn't get a chance to thoroughly scour every inch of this great store but what I did get, amazing! Try the smoked paprika, oh yeah!   Oh they also had French lavender.. I see a cheesecake in my future.. now if I could only convince the Mr to make it for me! He is a pastry chef after all!

The only reason to go here is for the drinks.. the drink menu is so much fun. The food however is pretty horrifying, think PF.. yep, seriously... not much by way of creativity or good flavor for that matter. I hate tiki tacky and this place is no exception.. more kitchy then anything.  I think they kept the decor from the last Scottsdale location in storage and brought it out for this place. Yuck!

Oh my poor tummy.. why oh why did I do this to myself?! The name of this place should have been called PooPoo's!! All 3 of us were pretty sick the morning after.. it wasn't pretty let me assure you!   The service here is great! Very friendly and fast.. the food well.. was hit and miss. The rolled quesadilla was pretty tasty.. a huge flour tortillas rolled with steak, peppers and cheese.. oh delish! Was thinking I would actually come back for this one. Then my red chile burro came.. looked great, nice and big covered in enchilada sauce.. then I took a bite expecting spicy goodness.. was bland and was almost all sauce, next to no meat what-so-ever.. you know how much I love meat! Dave took a bite and whispered to me "it tastes like cat food".. he's so wring sometimes and I thought I was crude..  Seemed everyone here was ordering fajita's.. if I ever go here again (very unlikely, bad tummy sickness and way far) I would try those.. the smell was fantastic!!

For a good cause.. that's what I kept telling myself when we pulled up to Sauce at the canal (Waterfront, puhlease!). Me and the Mr headed over to Sauce after our reservation for Digestif fell through (thanks guys!). We were very animate about supporting the Dining for Life cause so this was the next best thing.. well, maybe those are a poor choice of words. The thing is we didn't want to drive all the way to downtown Phoenix.. so since there were only a handful of places..   Anyway, I have never been a fan of Fox concepts.. mediocre food set into sort of cool spaces. Sauce is no different.. sort of cool industrial interior, down beat music and wine only 5 bucks a glass. The concept is great its just that the food is terrible on all levels. From the salad with next to no toppings.. to the shitty Totino's style pizza (yep, ate that shit when I was a kid) to the horrible pannini. Seriously.. the food is so simple you think it would be great.. its just doesn't work.. I think the ingredients are to scant and the quality is so so.   I gave one star for the lasagna which didn't suck as bad as I thought and the staff.. the staff is very friendly and attentive. Now if the food was better, well, I think we'd have a winner.

**UPDATE** No word from the management.. guess I shouldn't be so sensitive.. The food there is pretty good.. just wish that the Mister and I weren't treated that way.. forgive and forget? Take the highroad.. at the yummy tortilla's?.. dial a clich?! LOL! Perhaps I shouldn't black ball this place any longer?? Help me to over come!!    Well, I never! LOL! Tradiciones.. good food, good service, if you're Hispanic.. I sent an email to the manager with no reply and no surprise. I thought I would share my experience with you.  Dear Mr Braden,  I wanted to share our experience last night at Tradiciones with you. We have several friends coming in from out of town so the past Friday I had lunch and your wonderful restaurant. My friend and I had a exceptional time with great service (Mario was our sever) spot on menu items and overall were both very impressed. So I went ahead and made a reservation for a party of 15 with much excitement and anticipation. This type of excitement comes from years of dining and being a huge food enthusiast or foodie as my friends call me. This experience is in stark contrast to what happened last night.  My excitement carried with me the whole weekend so I decided to take my significant other there to have the same pleasure I had. Upon arrival we were amazed how busy it was and knew that a wait was imminent. After about 10 minutes I was able to make it to the front desk to put my name in for a table for 2. The hostess smiled at me and I told her 'dos', she raised her finger up to me and said "uno momento". Then she walked off and got another hostess, this was confusing as when she returned she started taking names of other guests and ignored me. Finally the new hostess asked me what I wanted. I told her I wanted a table for 2 she then told me that there was at least an hour wait. This was pretty obvious judging from the tens of other folks waiting for a table. Meanwhile the other hostess continued taking names then finally she added mine. I told her that we were actually here before the other guests the other hostess had written down. She ignored this and put my name on the bottom of the list. I'm not sure why she was acting like this towards me as there didn't seem to be a problem with any other guest besides the fact that I didn't speak Spanish. Our first instinct was to simply leave as it was perceived by us that we weren't welcome here. We stayed as the atmosphere still seemed lively and the smell coming from the grills were intoxicating.  After walking around the courtyard and enjoying some of the vendor stalls there we decided to venture back in so we wouldn't be missed. As we were standing there waiting I noticed that the patio only had a few tables and wasn't very busy at all. So we asked the second hostess if we could sit out there. She came back several minutes later to tell us the patio was understaffed and she couldn't seat us there though she offered bar seats instead. Perfect! We we're sat at the bar and were both excited to try the Cilantro Margarita! We ordered then, I saw her mixing it up, my mouth started to drool. She  then presented the drinks to us, cheers!  The drinks were wonderful and I'm not a big sweet drink fan. I then looked straight ahead and saw our bartender enter an order into the computer. As I watched her type I was amazed to notice that she named the check "Dos Gringo's"! Looking around I could tell she was referring to us as everyone else around us looked to have been there for a while. She turned around and I asked her "Dos Gringo's"? She smiled and started laughing like I caught her doing something wrong. She tried to explain that she gives everyone nick names and didn't make any apologies to us for the name.  Is it acceptable to call your non Spanish speaking guests Gringo's? I felt this was very offensive as I have generally heard the word in derogatory terms. Though this seemed to make sense as the way were treated at the hostess desk, were we just not welcome here? I continued to stew on this experience all the way until this morning when finally I decided to look up the word gringo to see if I were off base for my feelings. This is what I found...  gringo(gr&#301;ng'g&#333;) n.pl. gringos Offensive Slang, Used as a disparaging term for a foreigner in Latin America, especially an American or English person.  This solidified my feelings so I finally did some soul searching and decided to share our experience. If this definition is the case we will no longer visit your wonderful establishment, perhaps this will make a others more comfortable? If you can please help me to understand the term and the way we felt leaving last night I would truly appreciate your time.  Kind Regards, Foodiebear

The mister and I eat out way to much and have been frequenting the same places recently.. China Chile and Joe's Real BBQ have both been visited 3x each over the past 3 weeks.. okay so we're not as imaginative as we could be. The thing is that we have turned our friends on to these places and every time they go well, we get invited.   We just love Joe's.. it's a combination of elements, decor, pricing and comfort. This place is like that great pair of sneakers you have, a very good fit.   I almost always order the same thing.. pecan smoked ribs, mac 'n cheese and share a loaded baked potato to share. The ribs are meaty and plentiful.. not like those anorexic bones they serve at some other places.. I'm a big eater and can never finish them in one sitting so a full slab can easily be shared. Mac and cheese there is really good even better then my home cooked version.. seems to me I have some practicing to do in that department.   They also have this bbq ranch dressing for their salad that's a must try. Though who wants to eat a salad when there are some many good meats there to try. Their bbq sauce can be kind of sweet if you like that.. I'm a EOE (equal opportunity eater) and love all sorts of smoked meats and sauces but I know plenty of people who don't like that kind of sauce.  No table service here either, strictly cafeteria style. So be sure to have someone in your party squat a seat before ordering if you see a good table.

Place is awesome! Super friendly staff with down home cooking. This seems like the Chinese diner style food that is getting popular these days. We ordered a ton of dishes including eggplant, cake noodle, pepper beef chow fun, jellyfish salad, pot sticker and peking pork chop. The entire bill was 62 bucks! Great value as you can truly find at locally owned independents.   The standouts where the pork chop and the pepper beef chow fun.. so comforting and delicious!

Over priced.. over seasoned.. slow service. That about sums Quiessence up. While the grounds are sort of romantic (think plant nursery meets your mom's backyard) its not charming enough to make up for the boring menu.   While I can appreciate where they are coming from, "Slow" food does not mean that you have to wait for the food to grow while you sit there at the dining table.

Recently I was talking to a friend about how much I enjoyed eating at Harley's Italian Bistro when the restaurant participated in Dining Out For Life. He looked at me blankly and then it finally clicked. "I totally forgot about that place!" he said.  It seems that many people may have the same reaction because during several recent visits many tables sat empty, even on a Friday night. Let me just say, you're missing out.  It's understandable that Harley's has been voted some of the Valley's best Italian food for several years in a row the food is delicious, comforting and affordable. The sauces are made in house, carrying on a tradition of from scratch recipes dating back from the Roman Table days, if you can remember that far back.  Owners Lynn and Mike McGarry have recently updated the space with new artwork and fresh paint, but the friendliness of the staff is unchanged.  The food is simple and uncomplicated. Roasted Garlic & Cream Cheese Bruschetta ($8) is bread, cheese, garlic, tomatoes and basil, then finished with a bit of olive oil. Nothing masked or hidden, the flavors of the creamed cheeses and garlic are tasty. I only wish that the tomatoes had been ripened a bit longer, as they weren't as tender as they could have been.  Salsiccie Alla Vodka ($13) starts with farfalle pasta combined with sweet Italian sausage, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, onions that are tossed in a vodka gorgonzola cream sauce. This bowl left me reaching for more of the house made bread to pick up the remains of the sauce.  When you visit Harley's Bistro's Web site you can sign up for e-mails about nightly specials. For instance, Thursday nights are getting to be known for Lasagna ($10), a thick slab of layered pasta sheets, sausage, cheese and ricotta all baked up hot and bubbly. If I had an Italian grandmother, I'd hope she'd cook just like this, comfort and joy.  Available for dinner only Thursday through Sunday, Harley's also serves a mean Hand-Tossed Pizza (small $10/large $13). The crust comes out pale, but the chewy texture makes up for the lack of color. The many toppings include tender meatballs and juicy sausage, paired up with a choice of sauces, including one of my favorites, creamy alfredo. You can't go wrong here.  Desserts include the usual suspects, such as Cannoli ($5), Tiramisu ($6.50) and Cheesecake ($5.50). After eating so much, we just shared a few selections of Berto's Ice Cream ($6.50) Pistachio Tartufo and Lemon Strawberry Sorbet. I wish that these had been served in a bowl rather than on a plate with chocolate syrup and whipped cream; some things are just better plain.  Food this tasty should never be forgotten.

Met up with Helen Y for something new, Indian street food (Chaat). She has a great knowledge about ethnic foods and what they are so I knew this was going to be great fun!   We ordered just about 1 of everything off the menu.. as the plates kept coming and coming it was clear that you could order one preparation of a dish and have the several looking and tasting very very similar. While very tasty many were allot alike.   A real disappointment for me was the paratha.. it was extremely greasy and not very flavorful. I'm not sure if perhaps its a regional thing but I'm accustomed to something a bit lighter and slightly flaky. There was this other bread that reminded me of Indian Fry Bread (bhature), was so tasty! I would go back just for that alone!  This was another great experience with Helen Y and her amazing taste! Looking forward to going back but not ordering as much now that I know sort of whats what.   It's been hours and Im still full!!

Ive been here on 3 different occasions and each time this place does nothing but awesome. The crust is light, chewy and has a slight crisp to the edges. Sauce is fresh with a nice acidity mellowed with silky mozzarella cheese. There isn't a bad pizza on the menu and the kitchen is fast cranking these killer pies out so no long waits for food.   Eating pizza with a knife fork.. really?

Dating back hundreds of years, the Cornish pasty comes from humble beginnings. The half moon shaped baked pastry filled with meat and vegetables was designed as a lunch for soot-covered Cornish tin miners. To eat it, miners would hold the pasty at the crimped edge, and then discard that part after eating the rest of the pasty. This way the miners didn't eat the dirt they were covered in, missing out on ingesting stuff like arsenic that was common in the mines. While most tin mining is gone, we're fortunate to have the Cornish Pasty Co., which specializes in pasties.  With restaurants in Tempe and Mesa, each location has its own spirit. While both are laid back, the Tempe location has a more subdued feel with dim lighting and no windows. Mesa has a brighter interior with indie rock blaring over the sound system.  If you enjoy watching kitchen action, belly up to the bar at either locale for a first-hand look into the hard work that goes into making their delicious pasties.  As soon as I entered the Tempe location, the warm smell of wine gravy and fresh baked crust covered me like a blanket of mouth-watering comfort. The feeling was like going home for the holidays. I know it's a million degrees outside, but the feeling transcends the summer heat.  The first pasty I tried, The Pilgrim ($8), exemplified everything that tastes good at Thanksgiving, luscious turkey breast, sweet potatoes, stuffing and grilled onions all wrapped in a tender crust, then served with a side of cranberry sauce. After one bite, I felt like I needed to pay thanks to someone.  The Porky ($7) is filled with all that is good: pork, apples, potatoes, onions and sage and served with a side of red wine gravy. The problem with the gravy is that it's so tasty I'm not sure whether to dunk my pasty into it or drink it.  Never able to resist a good burger, I decided to take a chance with the Royale with Cheese ($7.50). Ordered medium, this pasty was brimming with a juicy hamburger, French fries and cheese and served with a side of Thousand Island dressing. As the meat juices ran down my face, I couldn't help but think of the scene in Pulp Fiction where John Travolta explains to Samuel Jackson what the name of a Quarter Pounder with Cheese is in Amsterdam.  The Peanut Butter and Jelly ($5) was served piping hot. One bite of this was not going to be enough. Filled with creamy peanut butter, raspberry preserves and sliced banana, the sweet goodness oozed out after the first cut was made. The plate was expertly cleaned in mere moments.  Cornish Pasty Co. has a small, but great, beer selection, including one of my favorites, Kronenbourg 1664. Plus visit during their daily happy hour from 3-5pm and you'll enjoy a buck off of every pint.

I wanted to love this place so badly! I love Tom, I love his concept I just really dislike this place. Meager over priced sandwiches, awkward setup and space and really bad counter help. The menu even sounds good but when it comes to taste, bland, boring and under seasoned. Sorry Tom, I tired, I really did.   The 2 stars are for the pullman pb&j!

I don't get the buzz about this place.. on my visit all three scoops I had (Stracciatella, Hazel Nut and Pistachio) were icy and lacked any sort of flavor punch. Ya know how can you fuck up the classics, right? Plus the guy behind the counter looked more interested in texting than scooping.   Maybe I was there on an off night? It was towards closing time, perhaps the gelato was a bit on the old side? Ill try again at some point..

Pretty good market considering that most buy from the national grocery chains (Phoenix is a chained city!!). Maya Farms is one of my favs.. not only do they carry more exotic vegetables (romanesca) but they also added Save Our Farm raw milk! That's worth the trip alone!   If only the local bakers and such would join the scene.. where's Willo, Tammie Coe and MJ Bread? The market is only as strong as the people willing to participate in it.

Hottest JJ staff ever! I mean seriously, everyone I saw working here was totally cute, crazy! Must be the proximity to the college?   Anyways.. the cute staff makes one deliciously awesome sandwich.  Me being the big eater that I am I went right for the money shot ordering the J.J. Gargantuan. Its the biggest sandwich on the menu! Loaded with genoa salami, ham, capicola, roast beef, turkey & provolone, its for the meat lover and not for the faint (or weak) of heart. Its so thick that you might be hard pressed to get this monster into your mouth. Somehow I managed though I've had years of practice eating thick sandwiches. If you also grabbed a bag of their BBQ potato chips you can add a sweet, smokey crunch to every bite of your monster sammie. Yes I do mean pry the buns apart and cram some crushed potato chips in there. Nom!  Now that's a cute sandwich!

As soon as I walked in the door I knew we were in for a real treat! The inside of this place blew me away. Not sleek, modern or sexy but comfortable antiquity. The sheer volume of this space would rival some dim sum houses.. its huge but cozy, I know that doesn't make sense.. you have to see it.. like going to your rich Mexican grandmothers house.   The food and service was awesome! This is how Garcia's used to be when I was a kid before they started to go down hill. Pollo Fundido was awesome however, the chicken had a slight fridge taste so you know it wasn't made that day. Seriously, if you go you have to try the Fundido!  It's stil super yummy!  Oh they used to have something called Olivia's sampler, basically everything in miniature with a green corn tamale.. its been renamed the Appetizer sampler.. this to is a must!  A TON of super yummy goodness!   Make the trek to the 'hood.. this is an oasis in the middle of a not so great area!

When I was a teenager I worked at Garcia's Metrocenter. As a lowly busboy at the chain restaurant I learned about how restaurants work. The job also offered me up some amazing Mexican food and all the chips and salsa I could eat. In the years I worked there, those never got old.  Back then, the operations were still watched over by the Garcia family, who had sold the name and concept to a large corporation. Today, the chain serves pretty much some of the most mediocre Mexican food around and many of their stores have closed.  However, the Garcia family wasn't dumb; they kept the best for themselves. The Original Garcia's Las Avenidas in Phoenix is still owned and operated by the Garcia family, as it has been for more than 50 years, and is not connected to the chain. Many of the dishes you remember eating as a kid can still be found and enjoyed here.  From the outside, the building has lush landscaping and a separate building for takeout orders. The interior is reminiscent of an old Spanish home with low slung ceilings and lots of woodwork. The main dining room is cavernous, like walking into a Mexican courtyard, bright and inviting.  Once seated, guests are greeted with a bowl of hot tortilla chips and a cruet of mild chunky tomato salsa. It took me right back to my busboy years. If you prefer more spice, ask for hot sauce, which they will provide upon request. I enjoy mixing the two sauces for a tasty hybrid.  To take advantage of the salsas, a Cheese Quesadilla ($5.50) is a must. I always ask for a side of lettuce and chopped tomatoes so I can adorn each crispy slice, then pour on some salsa.  The menu hasn't changed much over the years, which is a good thing. It's nice to know that you can always order your favorite dish, like my all-time Garcia's favorite the Pollo Fundido ($9.95). They take stewed chicken meat, then wrap it in a flour tortilla and fry it until it's light and crunchy. It's topped with smooth jalape√±o cream cheese and slices of cheddar cheese then placed under a broiler until the cheeses are melted and bubbly. Served with rice and beans, each creamy bite is sure to please.  The Combination Appetizer ($9.25) offers hearty miniature-sized versions of Mexican classics. This plate includes miniature beef tacos, beef flautas, beef chimichangas, green corn tamale and refried beans. Give this plate a good dousing of salsa and it'll be hard to stop eating. Aside from the mini chimichangas, the cheesy green corn tamale really hits the spot with hints of sweetness.  If you can avoid eating the crunch flour tortilla shell, the Taco Salad ($7) loaded with seasoned ground beef, might be a healthier choice.  Desserts stick to the classics, such as Flan ($4.50) and Sopapillas ($4.25). My favorite is Deep Fried Ice Cream ($4.75), a ball of hard frozen vanilla ice cream covered in honey and cornflakes then quickly fried so the outside is slightly caramelized and crackled.  While I'll probably never go back to busing tables, the idea of all-you-can eat chips and salsa sure makes it tempting.

After getting my car washed at Los Olivos the idea of heading back to Lincoln to do some grocery shopping at T.J.'s just didn't seem appealing. So on my way back to Scottsdale I decided to stop by this location of Sprouts Farmers Market.   The prices in here are pretty good though they don't seem to have the items Im used to getting for less at T.J's. Though that's not where they shine over T.J.'s, its their produce section. I can actually get items by the pound! Some of the tomatoes didn't look as good as T.J.'s prepackaged version but with those prices, well, we can all use saving a buck or 2.  While I wont leave my favorite local T.J.'s, in a pinch I will gladly shop here.

What's in a name right? I heard Pita Jungle and thought of some 2nd rate mall food court dive in the back corner.. you know the one with the guy who has the really long armpit hair. A  trusted food blogger wrote a review about this place so I HAD to give it a try.  Well to my surprise and honest delight this place didn't have one gnarly armpit to be found!! In fact this place is VERY sleek and sexy in its space.. the food super YUM-E! ((I do feel a little uncomfortable writing about food and armpits.. Im becoming far to self aware!)) The servers were all very attractive and their service very much fit the surroundings, clean, not rushed, comfortable and friendly.  When I ordered the Medchilada the server warned me.. he said he had finished one barely and that I may not be able to.. I just looked at him and said "hello!" with 2 hand motioning up and down the sides of my belly! With that he smiled and placed my order though I appreciated the warning. When it came it I was stunned.. he wasn't kidding.. this is THE BIGGEST thing on the menu.. HUGE! It came with the most tasty side of brown rice Ive had! There was so much chicken inside it was falling out the edges.. I sight to behold though not quite a sight when you saw me trying to eat the thing. Id like to say that I have an unhinging jaw but even this was far to thick to grab and take in. All for 10 bucks, oh yeah!   Oh yeah!!

Corporate chain restaurants aren't usually places I visit often, and when I do I generally have much scrutiny and suspicion. I know that might sound bad but I have good reason, Ive been burnt way to many times. Ive dealt with horrible service, unimaginative food and the whole annoying corporate shtick, complete with high chairs and screaming unmanageable children. Please don't get me wrong, Ive had similar disasters at locally owned restaurants, but knowing I'm keeping my hard earned money in the community makes that brutally shrieking kid a little less bothersome.  The North Scottsdale location of Butterfield's caught me off guard. I was all primed to dislike everything, but was surprised with a few of the dishes and the service was fast, efficient, and well, annoyingly friendly. How anyone can be that chipper at 7:30am is beyond me.  Being a small national chain, only 4 location, they are complete with lame corporate shtick. Look up in the massive dining room and you'll see pictures of buttered and syrup laden waffles on the ceiling. Then there's the behemoth menu complete with "Egg-ceptional" Eggs and "Egg-cellent" Specialties, I wonder who makes this stuff up? I suppose some will find this clever.  With such a huge menu it took a few minutes to try to find the unique and interesting dishes. Started out with the Dutch Baby ($7.25); a large oven baked pancake that's finished with lemon juice, powdered sugar and optional syrup. The texture is light and airy comparable to a crepe with a crisp edge. Order this upon sitting, it could take up to 30 minutes to make depending on how busy the restaurant is.  Biting into something heartier, The Bacon and Onion Skillet ($7.95) was well portioned for the low price tag. Crispy hashbrowns, bacon, grilled onions, 2 eggs with your choice of cheese and bread, was simple and satisfying.  Butterfield's originates from Illinois, so I should have given the Mexican Egg Burrito ($8.25) a little more thought before ordering. A whole wheat tortilla with chorizo, eggs and cheese, then in little plastic cups were sides of tasteless guacamole and salsa. Maybe in Illinois this is considered good but here in the land of Mexican food, it was a complete failure.  Sticking with the classics is a good idea, like the Country Benedict ($7.95). Perfectly cooked sausage patties on country biscuits then topped with eggs and country gravy. Though really, pretty much anything with pork and or egg yolks is going to be tasty.  When ordering try not to change your selection to much, it's $.75 for every substitution you make. For instance, the Popeye Scramble ($7.95) comes with monterey jack cheese but to have feta instead as well as yellow onions, added $1.50 to the bill. I mean really, scrambled eggs for close to $10 just doesn't make any sense.  Scrutiny and suspicion aside, with so many breakfast choices out there Butterfield's isn't necessarily the best option, but if you're looking for a change up, this might be something different.

Dear Rose,  I have to be perfectly frank with you. While you are sweet, kind and fun to hang around with I have to admit something, I am in love with your husband.   I know, I know.. I have never even seen his face though I have heard him sensually barking out to you in Chinese, wishing it was me. Tho, most importantly, I hear the music he makes with his wok! The sweet clang and clatter with fire blazing from underneath, your husband is a man of talent. When Im down he knows exactly what to make to help me to feel better. Crab in onion and ginger sauce as part of the number 1 special, only 19.99, is something of a long passionate kiss. The accompanied Green Beans in XO Sauce feel like he is giving me a massage from inside my tummy.. to top it off, 1/2 a roast duck and steamed rice.. oh the joy and bliss someone can bring you!  So Rose.. please understand when I say these things.. I know you work just as hard as he does but he is something of a mysterious person.. I would gladly fetch his slippers.  Love, Foodiebear  PS.. Wahsun rocks my world!

You win some you lose some.. Ive been on a losing streak for some time when it comes to Vietnamese food. Have been craving a good Pho since my canned of Pho experience at Todu..  The place is in a mostly Vietnamese strip mall which has a wonderful bakery that has Banh Mi.  The inside looks like it used to be a karaoke bar now restaurant. The service was efficient if not hard to understand. Had the Pho Special.. was alright, didn't really hit the spot.. the meat tasted old and the broth while fragrant didn't have the oomph like some other places in town.  I would not go back to this place while the Pho was alright the space had a weird vibe that I didn't care for.

I get in these moods where I just crave certain styles of food.. lately Ive been on this Vietnamese kick that has lasted for the past 3 weeks.. I think maybe in a past life I was a beautiful Asian woman!! In any case I took my co-worker Ruben to a place I just so happened upon online.. its called Thao's Sandwichs.. we walked in and found that we were the only non Vietnamese in the place.. all eyes turned on us.. Oh hell yeah, this was a VERY GOOD SIGN!!!  This means the food is going to rock my world and my tummy!  The place.. just awesome! We both had Banh Mi as well as Pho.. piles of fresh veggies and chiles.. loads of sauces, hoisin, sriracha as well as chile paste and soy.. the Banh Mi had one of the best crusty French rolls Ive had to date (sorry Saigon Sandwich) with ample fillings and an out of this world taste. I had the Pork Roll and Ruben had the special. Special was loaded with Vietnamese style meatballs (not the chewy ones) and covered with cilantro, chiles , pickled carrot and daikon..  We moved on to Pho.. I had the everything Pho including beef brisket, tendon and tripe.. in a delicious beef soup that wasn't salty as some other places tend to focus on.. seems to be quite a bit of complexity in that there soup! Then fishing around in there found all of those wonderful rice noodles.. then started covering it in Mules Ear, chile and Thai basil.. so many complex flavors all with a harmonious balance and aroma! Ruben played it safe with just the lean tender beef Pho. He can be such a daddy's little girl when it comes to new food experiences.  The one thing I would complain about was the fact that they were out of Boba and I settled for a Leche Choobee, it tasted like soap.. I think Dove to be exact.. simply vile.. I think the Choobee was alright, I may try it again some other time but without the Lyche!

When I hear the words dim sum my ears perk up much like a dog when he hears someone approaching. Then a certain caution sweeps over me since so many dim sum places around the valley don't even come close to those found in other cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco. So when a friend of mine and local ice cream guru, Helen Yung from Sweet Republic, told me about a new dim sum joint that reminded her of Hong Kong, I was elated to try it as soon as possible.  Phoenix Palace is quickly becoming a jack of all trades sort of restaurant. During the week they have seafood and Chinese buffets, a full menu with free delivery, and on the weekends rolling cart dim sum as well as a take out BBQ section. While carts only roll on the weekends, dim sum can be ordered any day of the week off of a smaller menu. We came just for the weekend cart dim sum, the BBQ section in the front of the restaurant looked amazing. In the window wrapped onto stainless steels hooks were selections of whole roasted duck, pork spare ribs and roasted chicken. I haven't seen a display like this one since being in Chinatown in San Francisco a few months back, very impressive. Come early or call ahead if you want to enjoy a roast duck to-go, when we left the display was pretty much wiped out.  Walking into the Phoenix Palace you'll immediately notice that you're not in Kansas anymore, the clientele is mostly Asian who have very discerning palates. You know you're in the right place when the target market is ethnic and not American. No worries about communication break down, the staff speaks English, even if it is a little broken. Though all you really need are your senses to guide you through the dim sum experience. After being sat, the carts will start rolling by your table to peddle their vast variety of dumplings. Each cart person will open a steam basket for you to take a look inside and along with a brief explanation, usually consisting of only one word, they stamp your tally card and move on. The carts don't come in any sort of order so just have fun and order away. If something looks even remotely good go ahead, it's really inexpensive.  One of the main difference between Phoenix Palace and the other dim sum restaurants, is the fact that not only do they offer 75+ different items, but here it's not only fresh but made in house. One of the carts that come about is a fry cart which at first seemed unusual. It's a stainless steel ride with a built in cook top where some items are crisped and heated table side which made perfect sense after one bite. In all of the places I've had dim sum, here and in other cities, I have never seen or heard of this before. Helen told me that she hadn't seen something like that since having dim sum in Hong Kong. If Helen is impressed, I'm blown away! We started with an order of Green Leek Gow ($3.15), with a translucent skin showing a silhouette of diced leeks and chopped shrimp, then crisped up on either side for a textural symphony. We also ordered the Pan Fried Pork Bun ($3.15) which had a slightly crisped edges filled with tender chopped pork, each bite was simply sublime. These were so good we ordered an additional plate of those chubby meat filled pillows.  The standards are done extremely well here, such as the Steamed BBQ Pork Bun ($2.15), as well as the baked version ($2.15) with its covering of sweet sticky glaze. If you've never experienced a BBQ Pork Bun in either incarnation, you really should. This is the all about savory, salty and sweet, dip in some chili paste for an added spicy dimension. Chinese Broccoli ($5.25) is slightly bitter, slightly sweet and has a crunchiness that pairs well with the softer noodle dishes like the Beef Rice Noodle Roll ($3.15). Long sheets of rice noodles are filled with sliced tender beef, rolled and then steamed. When delivered to your table, a lightly sweetened soy sauce is poured over the top. Shui Mai ($2.15) is as tender and flavorful as it was meant to be, porky and delicious.  Dessert dim sum is as much fun as its savory counterpart. Sesame Balls ($2.15) filled with sweetened red bean paste, surrounded by sticky rice, then rolled in sesame seeds and deep fried were pretty much a crowd pleaser. The Snow Bun ($2.15) was a new one that I've never seen or tasted before. A cloud of pure heaven filled with creamy custard, served warm, blew away any doughnut that's graced my lips. I also ordered a box of them to-go so they could be enjoyed again later. The tall and billowy Brown Sugar Rice Cake ($2.15) reminded me more of a yellow cake though was very good, hot and fresh out of the steam basket.  There aren't too many places where you can try so many different textures and flavor in one sitting. So it really is an experience to have dim sum with a close group of pals because food always seems to bring us just a little bit closer.

I love this place.. the pizza here tastes like it did when I was a kid.. back when pizza had a certain mystery and allure.. the smell of cooked pepperoni and not being able to see over the counter to tell what the smell was.   Every time I eat here it just takes me back to being the fat little kid I was and kind of still am.

Does anyone remember Price Club? Back when I was a wee lad my mother would make a monthly pilgrimage to the Price Club about once a month to stock up on Kool Aid and toilet bowl cleaner. I was always so amazed going there as the ceilings were are high as I had ever seen. I felt so small and amazed that there was so much for everyone. Now as a large adult I still get that same feeling going into Costco. So much for so little and enough for everyone. I just love Costco, friendly staff and huge aisles though I  don't think that matters much cause most are so much in awe at Costco they just stand there in the middle of the aisle. Who can blame them.. they feel the love.

My feet were frozen in place.. I couldn't back out now! My friend dragged me into this place for karaoke.. as soon as I walked in the door I wanted to turn around and walk back out. This place is 'the' dive gay bar in town.. there was some horrid karaoke going on in the front and some incoherent benefit show going on in the back.. the patio seemed nice enough but not a soul out there 'cept 4 drag queens smoking.   As soon as this guy started 'singing' some song from Phantom we knew it was time to go. Couldn't stand another second in this place.. just not my scene.. my friend was irritated we wanted to leave..

My inner Vietnamese woman seriously wanted steamed crab and garlic noodles last night for dinner though I have a rule..  we don't live anywhere close to the ocean so if I know its not flown in daily, I pass on my cravings. So away went my inner Viet-lady and out came my inner Italian macho man (quit laughing at me)!   The place is very cozy and definitely family owned, no corporate stamping here, this is the real deal. Super tasty, hearty, large portioned basic Italian.. just like mom would make if she were Italian!   I went ahead and blew off my carnal seafood rule (I'm a big butch Italian macho man, right) and went ahead and ordered the crab cakes. 2 HUGE crab cakes were more crab then cake covered in a thick creamy sauce with tomatoes and basil.. I did all I could not to lick the place clean.. mama always says I'm a proud member of the clean plate club!   For dinner I had the Ravioli Carbanara.. these plump pillows filled my plate.. covered in another rich cream sauce then topped with peas and bacon.. as I ate these I unbuttoned my shirt, I could see the hair on my chest growing, I indeed was becoming an Italian macho man (in my own head)!   The service was extremely friendly and for the quality and quantity of food this place is a real bargain. Crap Cake $13, Ravioli Carbanara $18.. my man tummy, full and very very happy!

With the more recent economic downturn and the price of gas sky high, my days of Whole Foods Market are over. So for the last month or so Ive been shopping at *gulp* Fry's. They offer some organic foods as well as really low prices but, when I leave I just don't feel good about it. Maybe its just the perception of shopping greener at Whole Foods. Knowing that if they can, WF will source as local as possible. That's always a feel good! When I leave Fry's I just feel dirty, the kind of dirty a shower can't wash off of you.   This particular store is about 2 miles from where I live but looks like it was built when my condo was built in 1972. At least my place has been updated recently.. however of the few Fry's Ive shopped at, this one has the most in store specials Ive seen and is never crowded.  So whether I like it or not, Fry's will be in my foreseeable future. Unless of course gas comes back down to 2.50 a gallon.. oh those were the days. Now please excuse me so I can curl up fetal style in the shower.

So me and the Mr have been in Puerto Vallarta for the last week having a wonderful vacation! We ate and drank and drank and of course, drank some more. One of the waiters in PV recommended to us that we try this place as soon as we get back, small world eh?  Getting back we tried Huauchinango as soon as we could, within 24 hours! This place is crazy.. after walking in the door we immediately felt like we were back in PV! Some sort of Latin wormhole opened up and transported us right back to Mexico! Oh how I love Latins and wormholes! We were of course the only white guys in the place, well so we thought. We were immediately greeted by a very nice looking white guy.. sweet! He was quick to explain the menu to us as its mostly in Spanish but you can figure it out pretty quickly on your own. Of course me and the Mr went to town!! 2 tacos al pastor, quesadillas, 1 carna asada burrito and a chicken/cheese tamale.   All I can say is.. oh, fuck yeah! This place is the real deal! The food is all made from scratch and in house. All the food we ordered was fucking great! The quesadillas were made from masa, stuffed with cheese and chicken then grilled and covered with green sauce, lettuce and cotija cheese. Hot, melty, slightly salty, tender, melt in your mouth good!   The tacos al pastor were just like we had in PV! They have a vertical spit loaded with layered pork roast and a pineapple.. all slow roasted to perfection! All that piled onto 2 hot fresh corn tortillas.. divine!!   Tamale was perfectly made, tender, non greasy with just the right amount of chili's, chicken and cheese.. here we go again, fuck yeah!   Finally the carne asada burrito.. this thing is HUGE! Loaded with tender beef, beans and rice.. was a real gutbuster! Also house made are 4 different salsa's.. red, 2 greens and a habanero salsa that I'm going to feel around the ol' choco starfish manyana! All had wonderful flavors but one of the greens was my fav, I think it was a creamed avocado salsa.. super smooth, kind of spicy and very flavorful!   All of this for 18 bucks!!   I know I should keep my mouth shut and make this my secret Mexican place but let me tell you, food this good should never be a secret!!  Comer con gusto!

Oh yeah, now this is what I'm talking about!! Great upscale, old school, romantic atmosphere.. attentive friendly service and simple steak house fare prepared very very well. With so many steakhouses in the Phoenix Metro this place truly stands out.   We had this seafood tower that was off the chart delish! Lobster, jumbo shrimp, snow crab claws, crab legs.. oh I was just floating.. haven't had high quality seafood like this in the valley in ages. Also had the Kansas City.. a bone in New York strip weighing in at 20 oz... oh it doesn't get much better then this.. tender, flavorful and beefy! Seasoned only with salt and pepper the flavor just pops right out.  Now this place is pricey but worth every penny in service and quality!

Come on now, let's call a turd a turd on this one.. Waterfront is a stretch, its a canal, a stinking fucking canal.. leave it to the Scottsdale developers and planners to put a Scottsdalian slant on the turd.. kudo's to them! However, with its chain stores and restaurants on one side and pretty lame so far on the other (Southbridge) this has become quite a giant and over priced turd.   Those skinny Scottsdale bitches that hang out at Pink Taco, words of advice.. Fucking eat something!

Please bear in mind that I try new things as they come. Korean has always mystified me.. I never even knew anything about it until one day me and the mister were cruising around (speedo shopping for our trip to Puerto Vallarta, j/k!) and happened upon this place.  Okay I have to say I was blown away! This place is awesome! The service was pleasant and they completely demystified Korean BBQ for us.. my tummy is happy we went! Had the beef with mushrooms as well as the pork slices in chile paste. The server cooked the food in front of us on the tabletop grill which was very cool.. the food was fresh and just delish! The panchan was fresh and many, I think about 8 in all.. Oh the dressing on the cabbage salad, just amazing!  If anyone ever wants to go out for Korean, Im so there!

Some great Yelpers turned us on to this place. Ive driven by here so many times because of the Costco location a few blocks away. They were right about this place for sure! Very very good Vietnamese and so well priced for No. Scottsdale.  Had the Special Pho with extra noodles.. the soup was clean tasting, great clear color and highly complex.. it was everything that Pho should be.. hot, hearty, salty and for me, low oil content. Also tried the Banh Xeo.. deliciously creamy, crunchy and shrimpy.. my only problem with the dish was the 'salad' part.. they used iceberg lettuce rather then romaine wish iceberg does not wrap very well.. reminded me of that lame place with initials.   Thank you MJ K! You rock!!

She's back, my inner Vietnamese woman and boy was she hungry! We were driving down the 101 when she suddenly took over and exited the freeway. I could feel her start from my tummy she was on a mission. Soon we were in front of Saigon Nights; a modest family owned place in North Scottsdale. It was the perfect choice since they have some of the tastiest Vietnamese in North Scottsdale, well; it's the only Vietnamese in North Scottsdale.  Tearing into the menu she ordered Edamame ($3.99). Being a super food she knows that it's good for her figure as well as her mouth. The young soybean pods are steamed then lightly salted just put one between your lips and pull. The tender soybeans simply shoot out into your mouth the taste is salty and the texture creamy, you can't go wrong with this healthful treat. Keeping with the lighter side she ordered the Grilled Pork & Egg Roll Vermicelli Noodles ($7.99). This is more of a salad with its ample portion of rice noodles with lettuce, bean sprouts, cucumber, and cilantro topped with crushed peanuts and grilled pork chop. Served along side is a bowl of prepared fish sauce which is sweet and salty but not fishy.  This combination not only satisfies her hunger but understandably calms her down.   She rests now, her cravings eased for the time being but for how long? Nobody knows.

Asian Cafe Express, or ACE, hasn't changed much over the last few years. Located in a nondescript shopping center in Mesa, the interior doesn't get much better than the outside. But you don't come here to be wowed by the interior design, even if you do think the plastic lobsters on the wall are pretty cool, it's all about the food.  Open the menu and within a few pages you'll see typical Chinamerica offerings, such as sweet and sour, lo-mein and fried rice. But keep turning the pages and you'll find some serious real deal Chinese food.   The best value is the Family Meal ($21.29), consisting of three large items, rice and noodles. This is a feast that can easily feed four or more.  Even more impressive is what the kitchen can do with fresh seafood. Across the street from ACE is Mekong Supermarket, an Asian grocer that has a massive fresh seafood counter. Diners can purchase fresh seafood from Mekong, then take it to ACE, where the chef cooks the catch for around $8 per item.  Our party of seven arrived at ACE with bags full of goodies we were greeted and seated, then a brief consultation began. We had purchased live seafood from Mekong's water tanks, including crab ($8.99 a pound), clams ($7.99 a pound) and two lobsters ($9.99 a pound). We also chose a large wide mouth bass ($8.99 a pound) that was cleaned by the Mekong fish monger.  Starting with the bass, the chef simply steamed the fish, then topped with a sauce of ginger and fresh spring onions. The fish was sublime -- fresh, meaty and tender without a hint of fishiness.  The clams were also steamed to perfection with a light sauce of black beans and spring onion. Each tender mollusk was a joy to eat with slight saltiness from the black beans.  Our crab was treated with a dredge of garlic, salt and pepper, then deep-fried. The chef was spot on, making a contrast between the luscious crab meat and the wonderful seasoning. While the crab was still in its shell, it was hacked up into more accessible pieces.  Finishing the feast, we "oohed" and "aahed" as our lobsters were brought to the table. Both lobsters were chopped into pieces, then stir-fried with green onion and ginger and served on top of a bed of crispy pan-fried noodles. They tasted as good as they looked. The lobster meat was so sweet and delicious I wanted to lick the plate clean. A bonus of flavor was hidden as the juices from the lobster were absorbed by the bed of noodles.  This was such a pleasant experience that I'd let the chef at ACE take the wheel for an evening of delectable surprises anytime.

Stylish and hip yet humbly manages to stay comfortable and understated; St. Francis is almost one of the best restaurants I've visited in a long time.   There are enough interior design details to satisfy our inner Martha and a menu that's well presented and executed, so why the "almost"? The service was off. Our servers couldn't decide who we belonged too, another table's food was served to us, then our salads and soups came out with the entrees, huge no-no. For a restaurant that's been open well over a year, these kinds of rookie mistakes, while forgivable, are just out of place and confusing. It's a fact we all have off days, they clearly were having theirs.  In the semi-open kitchen you'll see their custom built wood burning oven which is the cooking method for many of the dishes on the menu. Now maybe I'm nitpicking, but normally at this caliber of restaurant, bread is simply part of the service. At St. Francis to get a few slices of their fantastic house made baguette, served with extra virgin olive oil and sea salt ($2) you'll have to ante up. I know it's only a few bucks and really is a sign of the times, but really? So the bread was chewy and had an excellent developed flavor, okay it was worth it.   When our Meatballs ($12) with Moroccan spice, tomato sauce, egg and olive oil toast arrived I swear there was cheese on top. After one bite of these meaty spheres there was no cheese at all, ends up the egg was so light and airy that it had a cheese like texture. This is that one dish that will keep me coming back over and over, such a taste departure from the typical Italian style.   I'd highly suggest ordering the fork tender Pot Roast ($17). Better than moms, it was served with sweet corn polenta, bok choy, carrots and tomatoes, rustic and deliciously fulfilling. The white fish of the night ended up being a thick fillet of Mexican Grouper ($23). Like everything else, perfectly cooked, the plump flavorful fish was served with carrots atop a pillowy mound of mashed potatoes. If you're craving a burger, try the French Onion Burger ($13) with its smoked bacon, Gruyere cheese and crispy onions, its a beautiful thing.      Sticky Toffee Pudding ($7) with sweet cream gelato, was an excellent way to end such a great meal.   The food at St. Francis was on point with every dish being excellent. I look forward to an on day when the service matches the food.

Diners, Drive Ins and Dives was here some time ago so we decided to go see what the buzz was about. Well we found out.. yummy gelato! Delicious flavors and many to chose from..   This place is in BFE.. probably worth the drive.. besides the have a whole wall dedicated to the Food Network and Diners Drive Ins and Dives was hilarious!!  BTW, the episode will be airing Monday night.. so check your local listings, LOL!

I love this place and let me tell you why. Pure and simple I'm a control freak.. I like to control all aspects in my life and when I cant have my way I get a little wigged but quickly get over it. I mean we really all like to have control of our lives, well why not our food as well?   This place is awesome for control freaks who don't want to be forced into a pre-determined salad.. you control every aspect.. your greens, toppings, dressings, vinegars, salt, pepper.. its so awesome! On top of the control issue I also like places that are locally owned and have the freshest ingredients.. Market Bistro fills both of those perfectly! MB also plays really cool downbeat music, thats awesome! On my last visit they were even playing Poor Leno by R√∂yksopp.. I thought I was the only one who listens to them! They also do that song for "Its so easy a caveman can do it' commercials.  If you have control issues or not and want to control what you're eating, MP is the place for you!

The lovely tweaker cashier was so funny.. she was grinding her teeth so much that her smile had become rather crooked in her short years. Her hoarse cigarette voice boomed over the customers talking amongst each other as she called for assistance from another cashier. The life of a tweaker can lead you to many places but I have to respect the fact that she was working and contributing to society. In her tweaker way she was quite pleasant to me.. in fact she was far more friendly then the 'buds' over at Best Buy who are to busy comparing their stretched earlobes then to answer a few quick questions.   I love tweaker cashier.. she makes me feel like my bottle of water is just a little bit colder then the rest.

There is a time and a place for everything. Ice cream on warm days, hearty stews in the dead of winter, hot dogs on the 4th of July and hot bubbling soup in the cool evenings. This past weekend the weather was mild and cool, moisture still in the air from the rain which brought out the craving for Soon Tofu. If you're unfamiliar with Soon Tofu, to be warned, it's all about the drama, the taste and the satisfaction that not many soups can bring. Essentially its spicy Korean soft tofu soup, though could also be considered a stew since its so hearty and rib sticking.   After nosing around a bit Ive found that not only do we lack the ethnic eateries like those found in LA, but also lack a dedicated Soon Tofu establishments. That is until I heard about Chodang Tofu and B.B.Q..  Located in an extremely plain and unassuming building you'll be completely surprised when you walk in. Gorgeous hardwood floors and wood work through out with a friendly staff that immediately helps you to feel welcome and relaxed. Chodang offers your usual suspects of Korean B.B.Q., but has an arsenal of cold noodle salads and of course Soon Tofu.   As soon as your order is placed they bring out whats called banchan which are several different side dishes in varying tastes and interest. Bean sprouts drizzled with sesame seed oil, kimchi, pickled sea weed and sometimes odd items like potato salad, or in our case a apple and cucumber Waldforf type salad.   Now there is no need for this but we started with one of the noodles salads, #63, Chik Bibim Nyung-Myun ($9.95). So cool and refreshing this would be the perfect summer evening dish. Shredded cabbage mixed with long stretchy black arrowroot noodles all layered in a slightly spicy and pungent dressing. The arrowroot noodles are like those you've never tried before, Id lovingly call them edible rubber bands, they have plenty of pull spring and snap.   The Soon Tofu comes in 11 different variations ranging from seafood to fish roe as well as pork, beef and dumpling. With such an interesting range of set ups, it's simply about what you're in the mood for. On this visit #9 was calling ($9.25), a spicy red broth, with garlic, chili, silken tofu with a handful of perfectly cooked vegetable dumplings. When they bring out your Soon Tofu, this is where the drama starts, its wheeled on a stainless steel cart and when you see the soup you'll know why. Its served in an earthenware pot that's been heated in the oven and is blazing hot, its literally boiling. Then the server cracks a raw egg into the boiling soup which cooks amongst the scalding broth. What drama, what showmanship, how often can you say you had dinner and a show? Also with the show comes a bowl steamed rice. Korean rice is generally wetter then those found elsewhere which only adds to the sticky texture. Since each diner get their own bowl of rice, you simply spoon small amounts of tofu soup onto the rice and eat away.  No matter what the time of the year, know that Chodang Tofu can satisfy your inner cravings.

Shitty little Chinese places usually have alright food.. not this place.. nothing we tried even tasted good. A real emphasis on shitty! Ordered tofu, sweet and sour chicken and egg rolls as well as house lo mein.. I think it was the oil because everything sort of tasted rancid and was seriously greasy. Also the shrimp in the house lo mein didn't smell very good so I picked it out.. still the greasy noodles didn't sit well with me or my friend. She ended up getting sick right afterward though I was fine.   I am convinced that there is ZERO decent Chinese in Surprise! Perhaps there is another place I should check out?

I have been on a quest.. a quest for the almighty bacon wrapped hot dog or the Tijuana Hot Dog aka Mexican Hot Dog.. these bad boys are so illegal one lady selling them in LA was sent to jail for 45 days! Apparently the board of health doesn't look to kindly on street vendors grilling these on the side of the road.   After much searching on the internet for potential suitors for me quest I found this one, Mereno's in Mesa. This place isn't just in Mesa but in the part of Mesa that is well, like stepping into Little Mexico. Its awesome really.. carneceria's, Mexican food stands and of course 2 TJ hot dog joints (the second we spotted on the drive up to Moreno's).  Once there we were impressed! With all the buildings around there looking worn and tattered, Moreno's was like finding the Titty Twister in the middle of the Mexican desert, place was hopping! Of course we we're the only white boys in there but hey, if you like the looks of Latin men, well heyyyyyyyy!!   We ordered 4 dogs, a cheese quesadilla and a carne asada burro.. oh, they also have Coke and Sprite (Mexican versions) in the glass bottle! Saweet! After ordering we were told that we need to go back outside and pick up the dogs. Strange but okay.. made me a little nervous until we got outside and there was a street cart.. this guy was the hot dog monster! He had 4 made with all the toppings (beans, onions, salsa, etc) but to or disappointment the dogs weren't wrapped in bacon. Apparently the AZ board of health got to this place as well. The bacon was chopped and put into the hot dog boat (bun with a slit only in the center).    When we got inside we grabbed a booth and took in the surroundings. This place is actually pretty decent. Super clean, very comfortable and a nice salsa bar close to the counter. They had avocado cream, 2 kinds of salsa as well as cucumbers and radishes plus limes.  We of course we to town, I love 'salad' with my Mexican food! Once we were set up we tore into the dogs! They were fantastic.. the flavors and textures were as comforting as they were somehow exotic. Mayonnaise with salsa and bean, who knew?  The burro and the quesadila showed shortly after a few minutes. Oh the quesadilla.. super crispy and cheesy! The carne asada burro was huge! Surprisingly packed full of meat, pico de gallo and rice.. Ive never had one this way but I cant believe what Ive been missing all these years! Tender, salty, a little spicy (additional salsa) and slightly creamy as the rice was done very well!   As we waddled out of there and made it to the car we knew that we will certainly be coming back! On the way west to the 101 we noticed about 4 different street carts, all serving the same thing.. those yummy TJ hot dogs!  Anyone up for a crawl? Who knows, maybe one will be wrapped in bacon?

Have been a fan of La Canasta's Red Chile for ages. Then they closed Richard's that was close to work so in a jonseing frenzy I decided to drive a few extra miles to check out Sylvia's La Canasta.. was totally worth the drive.  Ordered a green chile and red chile burro.. while the red chile was very good the green chile was the real start here! It was tender meat surrounded by a thick and cream like sauce.. haven't had green chile this good in ages!  You order from the counter then you sit and wait for your food. This is not a full service restaurant's, just an fyi. With this in mind I thought that 5 bucks a burrito was a bit steep considering that the burros were rather smallish. For the quality and the all you can eat chips and salsa bar made it worth it. I waddled out of there!

Loved this place! Me and 3 other men hit this place for a guys clean up day.. we all got pedicures and manicures, which turned out so beautiful and shiny I feel very much in touch with my feminine side right now. *cough cough*, yeah, it was f*ckin' killer dude.

I wonder what the best words are for a place that has the most succulently juicy fall-off-the-bone BBQ chicken ever? How about fuck yeah! This fat boy would never steer anyone in the wrong direction when it comes to tasty vittles.   For me their chicken is crazy delicious and that sauce, oh that sauce, sweet, delicate with just a slight sourness really compliments the little burnt bits on the chicken. What's funny is that the chicken doesn't taste Asian to me but simply tastes like yummy BBQ chicken. The shrimp fried rice that comes with the dinner portion is moist, shrimpy and compliments the sweet and smokey chicken.   With sauce dripping from my chin and my fingers covered in sticky BBQ madness I couldn't help but think that BBQ chicken doesn't get much better than this. It's the thing to order.

I was in LA a few weeks ago and guess what flew off the back of a flatbed trailer. One huge ass mother of a bolt. Not like something you'd use to put a bed together but an industrial sized bolt that smacked (at 80 miles an hour) right into the hood of my BMW 328i. Seriously, not only dented my hood in but took the paint clean off, we're talking bare metal here.   So once back from LA I headed over to Desert BMW (see review) for routine service where the highly recommended Auto Restore Specialist to fix my baby. Here's the things with dents, you learn to live with them and accept them over time. So I knew I didn't want my dent to become a permanent part of my cars body, plus I love my car.   The same day I got a free estimate and went ahead and made an appointment to get my baby all fixed up. Well I can tell you that today when I picked her up, she looked like brand spanking new. The team at ARS are so skilled and professional that I can not recommend them highly enough.   Yes I almost cried, my car is beautiful again. Thank you ARS, thank you.

What's raw, slick and makes you feel good all over? It's sushi! From trendy scenester food to its current mainstay presence, sushi has been a part of the dining scene for ages. Even with time this time spent, sushi is still very much exciting to enjoy.  For me, Hana Japanese Eatery puts the amore in enamored and the fat into infatuated.  With a solid menu of offerings and loads of daily specials there's plenty to keep things fresh and engaging. When I'm eating my way through the valley, almost 8 out of 10 Ill order the special when offered. In this experience Ive been able to try amazing off menu items that were seasonal or the chef was feeling whimsy that day.  Not to whimsy but fully fun and interactive, Edamame ($3.95) is always a must for me. There's just something about biting into each pod and sucking the soy beans out that I find satisfying.  Like something out of a dream, the sashimi, nigiri, and rolls were served on a small boat. This beautiful presentation just goes to show how attention to detail goes well beyond the food. Such things like wasabi get special attention, Hana's pickled version will make you quickly forget about the traditional paste variety. Putting the wasabi to good use, the Blue Fin ($20/$20) was ordered 2 ways, sashimi and seared, the first being my favorite, each bite almost felt like eating butter, that tender. Such favorites as Octopus ($10) and Crab Nigiri ($5) were as pretty as they were delicious.  Loving rolls with contrast and crunch the Shrimp Tempura Roll ($8.50) filled both counts easily. However its special cousin, the Lobster Roll ($20), takes a California roll then is adorned with large pieces of battered quick fried lobster meat, no skimping on the good stuff here.  Hot dishes on the specials menu are expertly prepared. Scallop Edamame ($10.95) takes the sweet tenderness of scallops, then is battered and rolled in soy beans and lightly fried. The texture of the buttery soy beans meshed well with the sweetness of the scallop, a must. More special menu love was felt with the sauteed Giant Clam with Scallops ($16.95). Tempura Udon ($9.95) was ordered off of the regular menu and let me tell you, those chewy noodles are simply addicting.  Ive never heard the words Japanese and pizza in the same sentence before. So after our server described the Okonomiyaki ($18.95), it had to be ordered. More like a thick savory pancake in taste but the looks of a pizza, this was certainly a surprise by taste and by oddity. The top of the Okonomiyaki is sprinkled with bonito flakes which move and quiver when exposed to heat. So when it was sat down in front of me I couldn't help but stare at the movement. Yes, I was a little freaked out but how cool is that?  Hana An Mitsu ($6.95) was the most perfect ending for the style of cooking. This refreshing dessert made up of aloe vera and was accompanied by oranges, blueberries & red bean paste, reminded me of an exotic fruit cocktail. If chewy and creamy intrigue you try the Ichigo Mochi Ice Cream ($4.95). The chewy rice mochi shell encapsulates your choice of ice cream, very different and tasty.  Hana doesn't serve alcohol but feel free to bring your own wine, beer or sake, they wont charge you a corking fee, which makes that scallop even sweeter.

I have such mixed feelings on this place. We sat in the back of the restaurant which was great, and way better than out in the noisy ass piazza. The service was great, thanks Candice.. but the food, gawd the food was just only so-so? There wasn't one thing that I would come back for.. we had salume, fried dough, squash blossoms, risotto balls, margarita pizza, spaghetti carbanara, veal metballs, pork shoulder and some tube type spaghetti. The thing for me is that I want to eat something better then I can make at home, which isn't the case here. In fact I have all of Mario Batali's cookbooks and have made some of his dishes which were much better then what was going on here.   The pasta was a over cooked.. the pork shoulder had to much fat on it.. etc.. its stuff like that that makes for a mediocre meal. Oh.. if you go for gelato they are all good! We tried the carrot, salted caramel and coconut.. also tried the strawberry rhubarb and the chocolate malt sundae..   Guns and Roses was blaring through the sound system.. never in a million years did I think I would dine to Welcome to the Jungle!

This bare bones banhmi-eria makes some of the best Viet sammies in the city. Don't mind the dirty parking lot and cruddy sidewalks just mind the light crusty bread and fresh tasty ingredients.   Bring cash.

This morning I saw a review for Pho Avina in the Republic.. well the Republic isn't always a reliable source but for me Ive been all about the Vietnamese fare. It just so happens this week I'm house sitting on the west side so decided to have an early dinner on my way out.   What's funny is this place is right on the edge of my old stomping grounds. My elementary school is just a few blocks from there.. of course there were memories of my first kiss.. my first girlfriend.. none of which actually took place there but hey memories, cant control 'em.  I decided that I was going to be hungry for a Vietnamese sandwich called Bahn Mi as well as a bowl of soup, pho. Got the sammie, the special with pork roll, cilantro, cucumber, jalapeo, pickled carrots and daikon on crusty French bread. This was very satisfying.. while not as great as Da Vang it held its own.   I also ordered the Vietnamese style beef stew called Bun Bo Ko.. thick tender chunks of beef in a rich and complex broth served with cilantro, lime, bean sprouts and jalapeo along with vermicelli noodles. This was off the hook tasty! The flavors were sweet, savory, slightly spicy and YUM-E!    The service is very friendly and welcoming. The interior won't win any design contests but here, its all about the food!  They take plastic.. this is always an important aspect to me as I rarely carry cash..

Been out to Joe's Farm Grill twice.. and both times Ive been SO excited about going there and both times I have left well, disappointed.   This place is another restaurant from the Joe's Real BBQ gang (delish). The place is actually very cool.. you can eat out under the stars if the wind is in the right direction (there are horses close by) and they have a machine that dispenses as much ranch dressing as you can use! Gotta love that! But the food has been underwhelming and on the verge of boring. Ive tried the burgers, grilled pizzas and salads. For me they are not much better then what you could get at your local mall food court. I know it's crazy for me to say that but considering that much of what they serve is organic I just dont feel or taste a difference here.   The saving grace here is the coffee shop next door called, you got it.. Coffee Shop. They have lot of YUM-E desserts and make a some great coffee drinks. Oh get this, they hand pack there espresso machine.. no click click turbo-spresso machines here. I like the way that sounds.. I think I will steal that from myself!   Side note.. this place is in the middle of nowhere becoming somewhere.. bring a map!

It's confession time: I love a man and his name is Joe Johnston. Not in the way you might think, but in an admiration and respect kind of way. Johnston owns some of my favorite southeast Valley eateries, like Joe's Real BBQ and Liberty Market. He also has another place, Joe's Farm Grill, that's been featured on Diners Drive-ins and Dives.  Built out of his childhood home, Joe's Farm Grill is at Agritopia, a neighborhood being built around a farm in Gilbert. Many of the vegetables and herbs come directly from the farm and right into Joe's kitchen. It doesn't get more local than this.  You'd have to squint really hard to figure out what the house may have looked like before it was converted into a restaurant. The place has a retro-modern flair with a nod to the 1960s. The lighting fixtures are groovy, baby.  The ordering process is as straightforward as the menu approach the window and place your order. You're given an electronic buzzer that gives you a good scare when your food is ready. I swear, I jump every time.  The interior is relaxed and comfortable with plenty of open seating, though the best seats are actually outdoors under giant shade trees.  Also outdoors is the condiment bar with ranch dressing on tap. Any place that has one of my favorite dips for French fries on tap is a winner in my book.  The mainstream menu of burgers, pizzas and salads caters to the stroller pushing set that frequents Joe's as well as anyone who enjoys fresh, well-prepared food.  My mouth started watering instantly when I saw how good the food looked. I quickly sank a bite into the Farm Burger ($7.99), which was well seasoned and perfectly juicy. Weighing in at 6 ounces, then covered with a choice of cheese and grilled onions, this is one tasty burger.  The Thai Chicken Salad ($8.99 small/$9.99 large) takes local greens and veggies, crispy rice noodles and peanuts, then tosses them in spicy Thai vinaigrette. This one was a disappointment because I felt that the dressing was unbalanced with too much sweet and sour and not enough spice.  Joe's pizzas take on a slightly crisp char from being grilled rather than baked. Knowing that Joe does barbecue right at another of his restaurants, ordering the BBQ Chicken Pizza ($8.99) was a no brainer. Smoked chicken breast, bacon, blue cheese, fresh tomato, red onion and with Joe's Real BBQ sauce sounded like a lot of ingredients, but they worked surprisingly well together. The tangy bleu cheese and smoky sweet BBQ sauce created a yin and yang of flavors, a great combination.  For dessert, Joe's has milk shakes ($3.99) including vanilla, chocolate and seasonal fruit.  So it's with much love that I say I'm looking forward to visiting again soon.

"This girl's here to say.. with some luck and love life's gonna be so sweeeeeeeeeet!"..   I was actually surprised.. based on the name you'd think some big haired red head would scream out "Kiss my grits!" at anytime. Not at all! Its actually kind of romantic in there sans the dead animal head on the wall. Its cozy and a great place to have a cup of coffee and a sweet snack.  They make desserts like your mom would have made.. cookies, brownies and fridge pies.  Ah, I forgot, they don't use those click click turbo-spresso machines here.. each pulled espresso shot is hand packed and is very potent.   If it were closer to me in Scottsdale I think me and the Mr would hang here all the time.. but its "country, when country wasn't cool!"

The Mr and I love to go to San Francisco.. we try to go at least once a year. During the time we aren't there are always hip on reading about it and staying on top of what's going on there. I'm not talking about what color pleather is going to match what feather boa (Oh nelly!).. for us SF is about as center of the universe as you can get for foodie goodness! Some of the sexiest and tastiest restaurants we've been are in SF. Many cater to a more sophisticated diner as well as take advantage of the local artisan breads, cheeses and produce.  Then along came Methode.   When we walked into the space we knew that they were onto something. Rustic chic I think would be the way Id describe the space. Very comfortable, sexy and romantic. The staff was warm and inviting leading us to our table. While the dining room was pretty full the noise levels were very minimal.. I think due to the fact that most seemed to be there for a romantic dinner (close talkers and such).   Being curious foodies we ordered the heck out of the menu.. sweet corn soup, foie gras and sweetbreads. Oh how I love sweetbreads! Corn soup, was off the chain!  Dinner was Risotto for the Mr and Prime Rib Deconstruct for me. Yes and yes and yes some more.. toes were curling.. eyes rolling back in head.. we are talking about food here right?   The service and the kitchen were spot on, from the presentations, food temp and timeliness we were back in SF.. it doesn't get to be 110 in SF, back to reality.

If you talk to any real estate agent they always give the same three words of advice, location, location, location. Another dial-a-realtor-cliche is getting the worst property in the best neighborhood. Usually if you don't follow these guidelines you may have a long hard road ahead. Well So I thought, Bertha's Cafe moved from their location at 40th Street and Thomas to a hidden corner at 32nd Street and Indian School, boy was I wrong.  First step through the door you will be surprised that the carpet doesn't match the drapes, so to speak. The small space is filled with charming farm and bistro tables and a large case filled with delectable baked treats beckons you for serious consideration. It seems that even at a perceived bad location, Bertha's is one of the best sandwich places that you've never heard of. Aside from the baked goods, Bertha's offers generously stuffed sandwiches, ample sized salads and a rotating soup menu.  The Asparagus and Havarti Panini is Bertha's signature sandwich and for good reason, its killer. Stacked onto fresh baked MJ Bakery bread is a composition of oven roasted asparagus, roasted red peppers, pesto mayo and havarti cheese. I opted to upgrade my sandwich with slices of roasted chicken breast which took something great and made it better. The crispy edges of the grilled bread combined with the salty-sweet flavors of meat, veggies and cheese made for sandwich perfection.  I am still thinking about the Club Sandwich with its roasted turkey, ham, bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise and cheddar cheese. It's a classic that has only been improved with plenty of quality ingredients.  All sandwiches are simply served with a sinful chocolate cookie, so you might want to add a small side salad to your meal. I ordered the Pesto Pasta and Peas as well as the Dill Potato Salad. Both salads smelled great from the fragrance of fresh basil to the sharp earthy dill, but were a let down when the lack of salt and pepper left these both fairly bland. The problem was easily fixed with a few shakes of each.  Salads are fresh and crisp starting with the Goat Cheese and Roasted Red Pepper Salad. A pile of mixed greens is topped with pungent goat cheese, sweet roasted red peppers, tart sun-dried tomatoes and savory pesto was a hit. Thai Chicken Salad was another favorite loaded with crunchy bits of carrots, cabbage, cucumbers, peanuts, green onions and bell peppers. On top was sliced chicken breast, tomatoes and served with a side of spicy peanut dressing.  While I loved the chocolate cookie that came with my sandwich, I nearly had a food-gasm when I took my first taste of Bertha's Caramel Toffee Bar. The chewy madness starts with chocolate chip cookie dough then it's spiked with loads of Heath bar pieces, caramel and white chocolate chips, so wrong yet so right.  I wonder how busy Bertha's would have been opened in a prime location? With a lunch line nearly out the door on my last visit, one can only imagine.

Okay so theres a time in a persons life where they like to have choices.. lots and lots of choices.. well living in the southwest choice is abundant, so much so that the lists can be pages long when it comes to food and drink. Its really overwhelming!  The Mr and I like to take weeknight foodie plunges. Generally on weeknights I'm slaving over a hot wok, comal or grill while the Mr 'works' late, just managing to show up just in time to eat (life seems so unfair doesn't it?)! So when he got home last night and didn't see dinner ready he knew it was plunge night.   We both knew it had to be some sort of sandwich. We've been wanting to try a new place not to far from home called Andreoli's but for some reason I thought they close early. So then I was up to bat.. torta's! Oh yeah and I saw a write up in the New Times last week for a place on 16th Street. So we piled into the Honda and headed west.  This place is only a few blocks south of the famed Bario Cafe. Inside the place has been updated with tin roof walls and a clean open appearance. Inside oddly enough was a very attractive blond woman (think Uma Thurman) cleaning off the tables. She was the nicest person I had met in some time! She walked us through the menu answering our questions and making many suggestions. We finally ordered 2 torta's and a quesadilla (a gurl has got to eat!)! She then invited us to their salsa bar.. 3 different salsas, pickled carrots/jalapeno and freshly sliced cucumbers. Oh, beware.. the salsa's are on the spicy side and may cause pooper fire syndrome!   The tray arrived with our mexiches and quesadilla.. the Mr bit into his Pastor (4.99) and his eyes widened as if to attempt to make his mouth bigger by intimidation. Large cubes of pork simmered in a spicy red sauce inside of nice thick bun that had been lightly toasted. On to my Cubana (5.90).. This bad boy is also on a toasted bun though inside.. ham, roast pork, milaneza, cheese, lettuce and mayo. Whew, it was good good good.   As we were noshing through the torta's the quesadilla caught my eye. It looked so lonely sitting there with melted cheese oozing from the edges.. so seductive, enticing.. fresh. I had to take a bite!  Yeah babe, you're so good. The Alambre (4.99) is filled with onions, cheese, beef and pork slices on a very large flour tortilla.. this alone was worth the drive! The texture of the onions and cheese against the tender meats and crispy tortilla was just delish! This paired nicely with the Horchata (1.99)..  silky smooth and not overly sweet.  I guarantee next week when the Mr gets home and the kitchen is dark and empty he will know it his turn to buy dinner!

Okay, so I really should have the first to review on this one since the others weren't even reviews.. this place only opened this week. Well anyway, let me tell you what..  I just got back from Sprinkles, after waiting for 25 minutes in a huge confusing line. I got to the front and ordered a dozen, since there are only 10 flavors per day this was super easy! The staff has bright smiles and friendly attitudes. So after ordering it doesn't take long for them to pull your order together. The place was so packed that they couldn't even keep the front cases loaded and were constantly going in the back.   Okay so I might have some egg on my face but I must say (sorry Chris) that these are some of the cutest and tastiest over priced cupcakes that have graced my pallet in some time. The red velvet makes me wet!  I still say FUCK Sprinkles.. you're to close to my house!! Damn you Sprinkles! Damn your yummy assed cupcakes!!

It was by sheer chance that we ended up going to Radio Milano. At the corner of 40th street and Campbell there are 3 different restaurants to chose from, the famed LGO Market and Pizzeria, Postino Wine Cafe and of course Radio Milano. We had every intention of eating at Postino Wine Cafe, but after we were told it was going to be an hour wait, our grumbling tummies knew weren't about to wait that long. Looking across the street at Radio Milano we scouted ahead to see what they wait was like over there, what luck, we were sat immediately!  Opened in June 2007 by the same folks who own LGO Pizzeria and Postino, LGO Hospitality, its quite the neighborhood dining destination. The only problem here is the lack of parking, though with complimentary valet service this shouldn't be much of a issue.   The space has a laid back eclectic kind of vibe, barrel ceilings, lots of wood and brick and a funky soundtrack playing in the background, which provided a decent thump without being overbearing. Pretty much any where you sit the you'll have a view of the open kitchen, which Im a huge fan of. Something about watching the chefs making my meal just gives a place more of a homey kind of groove. I'm not sure how they did it, but the staff at Radio Milano is not only super attractive but friendly and extremely helpful.  Radio is know for their great cocktails, but not one person in our dining party ordered one as we stuck with glass after glass of Peroni ($5), a deliciously light Italian beer.  As you might be able to deduce, the food at Radio Milano is definitely inspired Italian with hints of moms kitchen. That mix might sound kind of odd but is most apparent in the starters and salads section of the menu. The appetizers are large enough to share starting with Toni's Deviled Eggs ($5). My mama makes a mean deviled egg so when someone decided to make one, the bar is set extremely high. Shhh, they add bacon to the top of theirs which trumps my mothers creamy delights, it's everything a deviled egg should be and more.  Shattered Potato Chips ($6) are made to order and like most parties, whats a party without chips and dip? Served with a creamy mayo and tomato sauce dip, these spuds were crispy along the edges and tender in the middle, these were woofed down in time flat. Another standout were the crispy bites of the Celery Ceasar ($9) which had us all cleaning the plate. The perfectly dressed crunch of the celery was a nice contrast to the creamy shavings of Parmesan cheese. The Tuna Crudo ($10) is an ample mound of fresh raw tuna dressed with a light citrus vinaigrette and served with shattered potato chips. I could have easily ordered another one for my dinner, very well balanced.  Main courses include pasta, fish and meat with a surprise or two thrown in, one of those surprises was the Lobster Roll ($19). A huge serving of tender lobster salad was spooned inside of a grilled buttery roll then served with shattered potato chips was amazing. Each bite beckoned for another and another though resist and enjoy each and every one. House Made Papardelle ($17) incorporated hand made ribbon pasta, sweet corn, tomatoes, seasonal veggies and goat cheese. Fortunately every table is equipped with salt and pepper grinders since notably the dish was under seasoned. A quick turn of the grinder brought out the sweet freshness of the vegetables.  Aqua Pazza ($23) is a fish offering which rotates frequently. This particular visit, the selection were 4 plump scallops served with sauteed spinach and roasted cherry tomatoes. While the scallops were decent they were swimming in an oily sauce. I think with the addition of an absorbant like potatoes, these would have improved from decent to great.  With only a few offerings Dolce or desserts were all that and more. You can order a scoop or scoops of different flavors of gelato which are made by the neighboring Grateful Spoon Gelato ($3-$5). Or go into a wonderfully sugar induced coma brought on my the Radio Chocolate Pudding ($7). Served in a massive glass complete with whipped cream, I'm not sure how you could eat here and not order this as waves of comfort wash over you with each and every spoonful. The citrus spiked Olive Oil Cake ($7) had a super moist crumb and finished with the delightful taste of olive oil.  Radio Milano may have been chosen by chance and circumstance but I assure you, when they re-open, future visits will definitely be on purpose.

Was in the mood for a TJ Hot Dog on my way home so I deiced to drive through Sunny Slope and look for a push cart. No such luck but I did happen upon this place in a Food City strip mall. Upon entering and looking over the menu I asked if they sold TJ Hot Dogs.. he told me why they didn't.. that doesn't make sense to me. He said that the ingredients to make TJ Hot Dogs would push out his Chicago style ingredients in his prep area.. I'm sorry but if you are in a largely Hispanic neighborhood and want to survive, feed the locals! Besides there are loads of Chicago dog places and only street carts for TJ Dogs.. I think he would make a fortune pimping TJ Dogs and Mexican beer!!   Took about 10 minutes to get my dog, Chicago Style.. was so-so.. it had a way to generous amount of celery salt making the dog well, salty. Also the dog was on the smallish size but for the price I guess that was fine.  Probably wouldn't go back.. though very friendly business owners.

I couldn't help but be amazed that the new FOODBAR restaurant stands for so much! They stand for local sourcing of organic and natural foods, artisan breads and friendly-outgoing customer service. Their slogan SEASONAL. FRESH. FLAVORFUL is true to it's words!   The 2 of us took a romantic walk over the Scottsdale canal (hipsters may call it the Scottsdale Waterfront but I believe in calling it what it is) last night to FOODBAR. We have been hearing somethings about fresh, organic local and decided to check it out. There was a wonderful person there named Ruth who greeted us with a cheery smile and a sweet and helpful nature.   The concept is simple.. a horseshoe shaped bar that you walk through and place your order. Well the problem is that there are several different menus including specials, sandwiches and hot foods. So you really have to think about things before you order. I didnt even know about the hot foods until I saw the chef plating up one of the juiciest looking chickens. I had already ordered or I would have been all over that! I think once the chef and manager figure out how to simplify the people will stop scratching their heads and eat. I have some suggestions for simplification even anyone from FOODBAR is reading!  We ordered a bacon and goat cheese flat bread.. a Cuban sandwich.. bbq sandwich and a white bean salad which was large enough to share. All the food was fantastic! The star was the white bean salad and the Cuban sandwich! The sandwich must have been close to a lb.. we could have easily shared that the flat bread and the salad and not had been as stuffed as we got! Oh, they also now serve wine and beer! The food we ate SCREAMED for wine!   FOODBAR is very casual, comfortable and stands for many great things.. it's not pricey, we spent 35 bucks for the 2 of last night and I would say we over ordered. This will be a very cool place to order a few things and share some wine and conversation with. It's certainly going into regular rotation.

Great little eatery in Old Town Scottsdale.. wonderful food and service.. plus its close to my condo.. everything we tried was fantastic.. basic new American food done really well.. the maple bourbon chicken was one of the juiciest chicken breasts Ive had in a very long time. Lasagna, awesome and huge! House made bread.. Oh gawd, have to try the bread pudding as well, amazingly delicious!   I wish I had the time to write something more full blown..

I'm not sure what happened to this place over the past year but the food was horrible!   We went for their New Years Eve menu which sounded old school but fun.. the food was horribly dreadful. 4 courses for $59, well in this case you most certainly did not get what you pay for.  Starting with the salad.. it under dressed and under seasoned, beef Wellington was abysmal, under seasoned and undercooked. Stuffed chicken was dry and tough and all plates came with a few pieces of carrot and broccoli, probably from a bag. The bright spot was the sausage and pepper appetizer, which was actually really tasty but the 2 bites left me feeling like Oliver Twist!   Then the desserts.. uhg.. the desserts could have come from a box from Costco, not horrible but ordinary and boring.   The service was still excellent but the food was just uninspired and poorly executed.   I used to love this place and it saddens be to say such things but I have to let you know, they need an infusion of something.. perhaps life?

Me and my bff went again.. this time I got the shake (I think they are called Glaciers).. regular custard with cookies and caramel.. after about 4 bites I couldn't eat anymore, its just to sweet. My bff got a peanut butter shake and had the same experience as mine. Just after a few bites your stomach starts to hurt from to much sugar. I just think its weird that both times we go we have the same experience. We just must be sugar intolerant?  I want to love this place so much.. they are so fast and friendly in there and the bites taste good.. maybe Ill see if they make an extra small.

There isn't much more that I can add except one word, amazing. If you ever get a chance to go, do it!   *tip.. Check the Mirage website for discounts. Honestly the best seats are the cheaper seats. We sat in the very last row and could see everything perfectly as there is a lot going on.

"Usted es el bocadillo ms hermoso! .".. roughly translated.. you are the most beautiful sandwich!  While this place is in a transitional neighborhood don't let the homeless fool you.. its really tasty! The service is very friendly and it's so cheap you can have a great taco lunch for under 5 bucks!  Let's get to the nitty gritty.. first torta I had from here the "La Presa" couldn't be finished.. not even by my portliness! Its 2 thick pieces of telera topped with ham, cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, sausage, chorizo and egg. This torta's HUGE, seriously! Most come with potato chips though ask for the salad instead. Its a serving of shredded lettuce, cabbage, sliced radishes, half a caramelized onion and a roasted jalapeo. IMHO, makes for a balance but really, you can't balance this out but the thought is there!  Alambre de Res burro, tacos and quesadillas have claimed major rock star status with me! Tender chopped beef, bell peppers, onions and melted cheese.. I think they use a little bacon fat too 'cause these bad boi's are bursting with flavor! Ah, gawd!  The fresh juice they make here can also pass for a wonderful lunch substitute. I like the granola, strawberry and pineapple licuado! A meal in itself!  They take your plastic card too! Just go for it!

So low carbin' is all Ive been talking about lately and Im working on creating a new list with my recommendations.   It might seem like a taco/torta shop is the last place you can low carb but Los Reyes is exceptional, especially on the cheap! Order the Tacos Alambre de Res ($4.75) and have them hold the tortillas.. so what you get is a plate full of chopped beef, onions, bacon all covered in melted cheese served with shredded cabbage, sliced radishes, sliced cucumbers, grilled onion and a grilled jalapeno. Slather on some salsa and don't eat the grilled onion and you've got yourself some good eating right there!

It was like some strange vortex enveloped the table and took us to another dimension.. from the second the waiter man handled my hot dog.. uhm, err.. let me start from the beginning...  We decided to wait a while before trying a the new corporate chain at Scottsdale Fashion.. you know how the weeks following opening day can be be well, iffy. So with that in mind and have tried the burgers at the Vegas location, knew that this might be fun. Insane huge menu, large portions and affordable prices. Upon arrival (parking is really bad since they tore down the east structure) we were greeted by a very friendly foh person and were seated immediately. The space is cavernous and was actually quite empty for a Thursday night.   After looking over the book of a menu decided on the Kobe Beef Hot Dogs as an app.. Blue Cheese Salad.. The Max Burger .. and Short Rib Sloppy Joe. This sounds like a sort of high end Weinershnitzel or something? The server had 3 tables and she seemed a bit flustered when she finally approached us. She was a pretty neat person and was very friendly but after placing our order things started to go wrong.  After about 20 minutes our Kobe Beef Hot Dog app showed up.. seriously, come on, the place was empty! Well the dogs are stacked high on thick buttered Texas toast.. well when the waiter set them down he lost control and one of the dogs fell off the plate and onto my bread plate.. well, no biggie right? Wrong, he reaches over and grabs my hot dog with his bare hand while mentioning 'Jesus' as he was doing it. You'd think I would have at least gotten a kiss first? He puts the hot dog back on the serving plate and walks off mentioning he would get us another one. After about 10 minutes the manager comes over (very friendly) and gives us his apologies about the hot dog man handling. Fortunately he had a replacement with him and took the app off the bill. Let me tell you though, if you can order only one thing of the menu, these are it! Seriously.  Blue Cheese Salad showed up as a Chopped Salad *sigh*, drinks sat empty, bread bowl empty,  manhandled Jesus hot dog still in my head. The entrees finally showed up, this is a good hour after being sat in a mostly empty space. Just kept humming 'Things Can Only Get Better' (still love Howard Jones), ah happy place! The The Max Burger was room temperature and the cheese was just sitting on top in that sort of I'm trying to melt stage.. not good. At that point I was so over it! Now the Short Rib Sloppy Joe was pretty darn good! Piping hot and full of that familiar 'manwich'  flavor, reminded me of being in grade school again, those were the days. Hmm, now I remember why I was always the fat kid in school..   Ordered desserts.. New Orleans Beignets.. Deep Dark Fudge Cake.. and Banana Cream Pie.. after some time the desserts finally showed up.. the Beignets were HUGE.. Ive never seen a Beignet that large before.. comes with 3 dipping sauces.. while big they were just alright in taste.. I prefer the smaller ones as they aren't as doughy.. Deep Dark Fudge Cake, oh yeah! This was almost as good as the chocolate cake at Coronado Cafe.. dense, chewy intense choco- curl-your-toes yumminess! The Banana Cream Pie, well, just order the Deep Dark Fudge Cake.. not so much on that one.. thick hard graham pie shell covered with pastry cream, brown bananas and so much whipped cream you would think they were trying to hide something, hmm, brown bananas anyone?  I still think it was some sort of Vortex that we got sucked into. The nice manager came over and I joked around with him about my theory. Apparently he thought it was so funny he offered to take care of the desserts and invited us to 'please give us another chance'. He did mention that if they try to seat us at that table again, ask to be moved. Im not sure if I will come back to Grand Lux unless I bring a spiritual guide and a set of tongs for the manhandling hot dog waiter.

Me and some of the boys were feeling like ribs after seeing Sweeney Todd.. yeah we're sick like that.. would have preferred meat pies.. ANYHOO.. got there during lunch time.. I'm not a fan of the whole corporate shtick and this place is well.. all shtick.. from the 'leg lamp' to the bottle caps glued on the wall this place is actually more kitsch and not in a good way. I would like to say though that the chair I sat in was SO comfortable that I could sit and stare at all the crap on the walls for hours. I mean seriously, there is tons of stuff on the walls there, dizzying.   Being the adventurous one, ordered the fried pickles.. ya know you had to order at least once to say you tried them.. well, I wouldn't order those again.. let's just say I like my pickles firm! I ordered the trip tip salad for my lunch.. not much to say about it.. it was what it was.. overly sweet bbq ranch dressing with a few pieces of tri tip (was very tender) all covered in cubes of cheese. In fact none of us even ordered the ribs *sigh*.   The service was super slow though food is priced well and the portions very large. Typical corporate experience not to good, not to bad just ho hum.. will probably not return. Prefer Joe's BBQ for the time being.

SanTan Brewery in downtown Chandler is a great place to enjoy fantastic beer at low prices. Opened in 2007 and located in historic downtown Chandler, SanTan occupies a former bank building where some artifacts were left intact. Stacks of safety deposit boxes have been re-purposed into seating and the old vault remains as an office for the pub.  The open space is relaxed and comfortable, though with many hard surfaces it tends be on the noisy side. For a quieter experience, opt for one of the many seats on the patio, where there can be great people watching.  Summer heat requires ice-cold beer. For me, beer is like enjoying a really good piece of bread. Grains and yeast that are mixed together to produce something that is so organic, hearty and satisfying.  I tend to order dark beers, since I enjoy the deep robust flavors, and SanTan's Gordo Stout ($4.75) certainly fit the bill. With smooth notes of chocolate and coffee, this beer wasn't as heavy and belly filling as you might expect. The Gordo is one of the lowest alcohol content beer made here and, for me, one of the most flavorful.  The menu at SanTan ranges from salads and pizzas to sandwiches and burgers, with most being $12 or less. There are so many tasty appetizers that it's easy to go a little crazy and order too many. The Downtown Sliders ($8), three juicy mini burgers topped with beer-braised onions and beer mustard, were way too easy to eat. The SanTan Stingers ($8.50) are wonton wrappers filled with Applewood-smoked bacon and spicy jack cheese, then deep friend for a light crispy crunch. Soft Pub Pretzels ($6.50) were were another good choice.  As for entrees, the SanTan Ruben ($9) was piled high with juicy and flavorful corned beef, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut and Thousand Island dressing. The tender Rib-Eye Philly ($10.50) was wrapped in warm soft beer bread and packed with beef, peppers and onions, then slathered with house beer cheese. Each sandwich came with French fries that were worthy of their own plate.  SanTan Brewery offers dessert, but you might want to learn from me and pace yourself.

BB is the best! Did my first organic pick up this morning at Guadalupe and 101.. the baskets aren't as big as the conventional baskets but awesome none the less. I had some celery as soon as I got home.. tasted like celery.. juicy, salty and fresh.. unlike the shit you get from the store that tastes like nothing. This is a great deal and I'm so happy that we have something like this here. In these hard times its good to know that you can still eat well for less.  The conventional baskets are great as well.. only 15 bucks! These baskets however are nearly over flowing with produce. Last time me and the Mr got one we gave away almost half of it.. way to much for 2 people.. also picked up a case of tomatoes last week and canned about 16 jars of home made tomato sauce.. great value if you like to can!

When I pulled up I was very skeptical of this place.. kind of old and run down and in a sort of off part of 16th street next to Circle K.. well I was meeting friends and Amy D. had talked so highly of it so I couldn't back out now. My friends showed up and were kind of scared though they haven't been out with me for ages so it would be an adventure for them. Ill dodge bullets for a good bite to eat and they know it!   Burgers, fries shakes and a few odds and ends on the menu well, here it goes. Ordered a half pound burger with cheese and a side of fries, 4.99 as well as a strawberry milkshake.. I was making sure we all ordered what they are known for, good burgers, fries and shakes.. okay, so I'm blown away! The burger was totally juicy without being greasy.. the fries were crispy and flavorful and the shake tasted like it should have.. thick, creamy and fruity! My friends all LOVED the food here and were thanking me on the way out.. so much for it being scary.   Lucky Boy rocks! The burgers remind me of how a good burger should be, simple, tasty and cheap. Now that's American!

So my craving and curiosity finally over rode my laziness to truck to the north but let's say it was SO worth it!!  This place is not only like Pinkberry but in my humble opinion surpasses it! The Twangy fro-yo has the familiar tang but with a more creamy mouth feel and tangier intensity. They also offer WAY more toppings including cereal, fruit and jimmie's... while they have my beloved Fruity Pebbles and Mochi they also have loads of other items. Included cotton candy (looks like the candy Nerds but tastes like cotton candy).. very unique. Other fro-yo flavors include Pomegranate, Mango, Blueberry and of course the PB like Twangy.  We also tried the frozen custard.. oh yeah, good stuff as well though, I was loving my Twangy to much to even think about ordering it. We met the owner very handsome Dave Cha, super nice guy,  and knowledgeable about all things fro-yo. It was a treat to meet someone with such enthusiasm and genuine sincerity.. especially in that neck of the woods (North Scottsdale).   If you have a craving for the good stuff.. do yourself a favor and head to Ice Tango.. I really don't think you'll be disappointed. Hurry before the word gets out and there are lines out the door!!

No fresh fruit.. no mochi.. not Pinkberry!   It's pretty unfair to compare every fro-yo joint to Red Mango or Pinkberry but for me these places have set a certain standard that every fro-yo place for me has to live up to.. Golden Spoon, no exception.. I would compare the taste of the fro-yo here to that of what you get at some convenience stores.. now granted I only had the vanilla with yogurt chips and Ive been told that the chocolate is better, but if you cant do vanilla right, well.. what's the point? It also wouldn't be hard for them to add fresh fruit, come on, really?!  I can't wait till Pinkberry opens a location(s) here!

Ive been hearing loads of cool things about this place so when a friend invited me and the Mr for breakfast I was on it! When we got there I was surprised to see that it was a Taco Bell before though they have done a decent enough job of making the place their own.. sorta 50's ish.. the patio surround is very cool.. looks like another project for our own home updating. Anyway..  Service is quick and the menu interesting. I had the Banana French Toast and the Loretta.. both were really good though I wish the Loretta would have been hot when I got it. Oh yeah, ordered oj as well and the glass that it came in was covered in chapstick, lip marks and all! Now my lips were a little dry but I don't think it was their intention to moisturize my lips! The server changed it out pretty quickly..  So just a couple of dings, not to shabby. I think that on future visits (fur sure) it will be fun checking out more of the menu.. next time Im going to pretend to be a kid and order the M&M Pancakes! Yum!

Okay.. so I'm one of those people who loves taking a chance and trying grand openings. Humble Pie is one of this places Ive been waiting for since I read about it a year and a half ago. So today was their first public opening so with a spray of cologne and some plastic we were on our way!  Let me tell you up front, this place is going to be packed for a while. We arrive around 6:30 pm and not a table to be had so we opted to sit at the bar. We had a pretty good vantage of the whole place.. from the warming boxes at the front to the wine cellar on the far part of the restaurant (I want one of those!). The space looks like it's not quite finished but you can tell and feel that the space is going to be very comfortable.   To start they offer wine flights, oh yeah honey.. thats what I'm talking about! Nothing like a nice heady wine buzz to get things started. Pouring over the menu was pretty easy.. there are a handful of apps, salads and pizza's. I started with the Grilled Steak Salad.. this salad is very good though the addition of some cheese would sent it over the top! We also ordered the Humble Caprese.. you know when your toes start to curl when you're about to uh, uhm.. well, ya know.. its sort of like that! Super creamy mozzarella, roasted cherry tomatoes on the vine.. it doesn't get much better, simple, clean and flavorful.  Pizza's.. Schreiners Sicilian Sausage with roasted Fennel.. Wild Mushrooms and Pancetta.. to start the crust.. light, slightly crisp, chewy, slightly salty in a good way.. for me, the crust here was nothing short of perfect.. it held the ample toppings nicely and of a nice chew and balance with the flavors of the topping. Sausage and Fennel was great plus nothing like sourcing locally! The Mushroom and Pancetta was a nice balance of earthy mushroom varieties and crispy salty pancetta. The mozzerella on the pizza's was the same heavenly pillow used on the Caprese.. beware, addictive!  We also received a mistake pizza of Pepperoni Pizza.. apparently we were in the right place at the right time since the guy next to us liked his mistake pizza (no sauce) so we were happy to take it off the waiters hands!  I'm not a fan of pepperoni, usually it's greasy limp and fatty. The pepperoni was crisp and well, I could eat one of these for breakfast!  I'm glad that kitchen had a few kinks to work out, this was a great mistake.  On to the desserts.. we tried the Olive Oil Gelato as well as the Fresh Berry Crostada. Having had Olive Oil Gelato at a place in LA called Mozza I was hoping that Humble's version would be better. It didn't disappoint! A very light taste of good olive oil surrounded in a creamy well textured gelato.. I would order this one over and over again! The Crustada was well done and since berries are in season this made for a nice treat.  So me and the Mister very much liked this place and want to fall in love.. so right now we are in the infatuation period.. we went ahead and made a reservation for tomorrow night.. I have plans on chowing down a Shrimp, Barrata pizza and or course, that marvelous pepperoni.

We all piled in the car and headed to Mesa for some Indian food. For whatever reason we've all been dying for some Indian food this past week.. dreaming of naan bread, Id been waking up with a puddle on my tummy.. it was time to fulfill my dreams and desires.. all you can eat style!!  The garlic naan here is simply amazing and they bring basket after basket.. the buffet items were all freshly prepared and delicious. The group favorite was the chicken masala.. super tender white meat chicken in a creamy yogurt sauce. From the lentils to the chick peas, every thing we tried was super great! Okay except for.. the tandoori chicken.. dry as a pop corn fart.   I hope I'm not alone in my naan bread dreams.. they seemed so real!

Here's the deal.. every Sunday for the summer BS, hehe, is doing the Sunday Night BBQ from 6-9pm.. $49 bucks each, you get your choice of 1 entree which is either skirt steak (most tender and awesome, ask for the sauce on the side to really taste the quality meat), chicken (Im pretty sure its brined cause it was so juicy) or salmon.. these come with 3 shareable sides, grilled asparagus, truffled mac 'n cheese and grilled corn on the cob. Cool you say? Well it gets better.. in the meantime there is also a buffet for your apps and salads. Were talking heirloom tomato salad with fresh mozz... duck confit salad.. fresh seafood (XXXL shrimp, crab legs, muscles and clams) as well as kobe beef sliders, pulled pork sliders and mini lobster rolls. There are also 3 wonderful soups served in espresso cups! Now if this isn't enough after dinner you get dessert. Root beer float and apple crisp! Then when they bring the check they bring cookies!   This is the BEST deal in town with the quality of the food as well as some of the best service Ive had in ages. Top notch!! Oh and the patio is just as sexy as the inside space. Clean and modern, right out of Dwell magazine. I can guarantee we will be doing this again!   I'm gushing over Michael Mina.. I just cant believe it!

Just got back from trying the Restaurant Week menu at Bourbon Steak.. it was f-ing awesome! The space, service, quality and presentation were all top notch. My only minor complaint is that the food portions seemed really small.. however, we were all quite satisfied even before the desserts showed up (thanks duck fat fries).   Here's a quick list of the best values when ordering for Restaurant Week (they did change the menu that was listed on the website)..  App: Soup and Sandwich.. large bowl of corn chowder with crust less grilled cheese..  Entree: Filet of Beef.. The filet was one of the most tender and delicious Ive ever had..   Dessert: Beignets.. better than Krispy Kreme.. light and satisfying..  All for 29 bucks.. this is a great value! Oh and use your Opentable.com account for some quick points on your reservation!

Well my Mr turned 40 today and what better way to show my love then to take him out for a nice dinner for 2. Well as you can see by my rating this went horribly wrong very fast.  ***** The space at Fines is modern comfort. Comfortable with long oversized banquets.. ball chain screen and cool stained concrete floors that looked like suede. We were sat off a 7pm reservation immediately. We both noticed that the patio was hopping.. great for a new local business. We ordered a couple of glasses of wine from the host and loved the selection from that menu as well as the food menu.  **** We waited for some time until our glasses of wine were brought to our table. The person delivering was apparently our server. She never asked how we were.. told us her name.. just dropped the wine off and asked if we were ready to order. We placed our order and took in each other. The wine was very good and the space comfortable. Our apps came out in pretty decent time and we dug in. I had the calamari and the Mr had the BLT.. both were pretty good though mine should have had less salt. Otherwise the food paired with our wines quite well.  ***Waiting for our plates to be cleared we felt that maybe we weren't that important. The host guy was fawning over 2 tables with champagne service as well as sports scores for the table next to us. Service is a pretty big deal to me and can pretty much ruin an evening. Finally our plates were cleared and salads brought out some time after that. I had the Arancini and the Mr had the grilled radicchio salad. Both were prepared well and pretty tasty. We also ordered 2 more glasses of wine which came out pretty quickly. Then we were done and we waited once again.. and waited.. and waited.  **Meanwhile the server assistant came and took our plates. I also asked where my new glass of wine was I had ordered at the beginning of the salad course. The assistant went to the bar and grabbed my glass of wine and was intercepted by our server who then snatched it from her hands. She then tossed her hair and brought me the glass. Now we had no silverware.. no water and a glass of wine. Then we waited and waited again.  *Finally after 35 minutes our server told us the kitchen was backed up and that the entrees would be out in 5 minutes. We told her fine if it was only 5 minutes. We waiting this long, whats another 5 minutes? 5 minutes passed, then another 5, finally I called her over and asked for the check. She said the entrees were coming up soon I told her just the check please. She asked if we wanted them boxed. I told her sure. She brought the check out, 150 bucks.. I paid and left her only 10% which was VERY generous.. she brought the boxed entrees which we left on the table and stormed out.  As you can see the Mr birthday dinner was squashed.. I got mad and paid to much for food we didn't eat. So much for an awesome dinner for his birthday. Now I feel embarrassed, let down and of course sad that I didn't show my man a good time on his once 40th birthday.  What a real shame to what could have been a great place muddled by horrendous service. "The valley's premiere wine/dine destination".. yeah keep trying to believe that!

For me, it doesnt get much better then this. Well organized and a staff that actually knows about wine. VERY well priced as well. My BFF and I were in there last night to start shopping for wine for her impending wedding (sounds doom like, eh?). We found so many bargains we walked out of there with 14 different bottles to taste including several that were under 2 bucks (look out Charles Shaw!).. I tried the cab last night.. not to shabby, fruity and not to complex.. very accessible for non red lovers.. anyhoo one of the sales guys was so helpful! He turned me on (yes he was cute) to a section that was dedicated to Portugal.. who knew? Great value here and no stupid discount card needed!!

Horribly, nasty vile and those words are just for the bitch behind the counter. The gelato here is just disgusting.. after 2 bites it hit the trash. Also, VERY over priced.. over 8 bucks for 2 tastes.. chocolate looked awesome though tasted like it come from a powder.. sort of like frozen Ovaltine. Also tried the lemon.. it had that weird fake lemon taste.. pretty shop in a pretty hotel. Unforgettably its all window dressing.

West Wing Bar is so well hidden, I was almost not going to write about it since its my little secret. Its ultra cool lounge spaces are just fantastic. Reminds me of something you'd find in San Francisco. Plus during 5-7p the have 2 for 1 drink specials.   After a long day this is the best place on the strip to chill and unwind.. they even have chaise lounges in there.. I'm not kidding!

Once I month I take Ma out for lunch, she's totally on board with trying something new each time we eat. I had heard of all the wonderful places in Old Town Glendale but after my so-so experience with Bitzee Mama's we decided to try another. Being always up for Mexican food we decided to check this place out. We pulled up and it is the most charming old house restaurant conversion. Its like being at your country grandma's house.  After being greeted and seated we both decided on a quesadilla and each had the enchilada's. After only minutes the food was out and we were digging into some yummy old school Texas style enchiladas. I say Texas but the sauce was dead on for chili gravy which I have tried and failed at before. Imagine a smooth and creamy enchilada sauce that is mild but flavorful. Me and Ma were both ooing and ahing over the yummy enchilada's.. we had a great time! Im glad that me and Ma can have experiences like this and I take none of them for granted.   This place is filled with charm, friendly quick service and good food at decent prices. A must if in the area.   Sorry about the quality of the photo's.. iPhone's don't take great pics!

Gabi nailed this place on the nose.. food was cold.. wait staff was friendly enough but the service was as confused as this entire concept. French country farmhouse but fine dining? That doesn't make sense to me.. a farmhouse to me would have been laid back and comforting, not contrived and skimpy.  The prices here are very high and the portions are super small.. had the ahi app, it was actually alright, thus the one star. The next app was the beef pave, tasted like liver and was horribly dry! My entree was the beef fillet with cheek meat.. cold, uninteresting and of course over priced.   We order all of the desserts hoping for a change however, the desserts to me seemed pretty lame so I got the cheese plate. Cheese was alright though none of the wait staff could tell me what was what. The desserts looked great but didn't taste very good at all. This place didn't have one saving grace.   Afterwards we decided to go to the bar/lounge 'Upstairs". Cool loungy vibe until we got out of the rest room.. walked right into some woman throwing up on the floor. Was really quite a scene and a top to a most horrible dining experience. I flagged down one of the schmoozing managers and told him what had happened in the hallway.. he just raised his eyebrows and said "Oh, great!" then walked off. No apologies, no remorse.. just walked off.   I would never return to either place.. overpriced, contrived and as I said before uninteresting. What a waste of time.

Pretty cool space for sure.. the pastries were nice as well.. the 3 girls behind the counter seemed like they could have cared less if we were there or not.. whatever.   Had a pecan toffee tart.. eh, have had much better.. this one would be have really good if it didn't taste like the caramel was burnt. I will say though they they do have some of the prettiest pastries Ive seen in the valley.. very clean and creative.

After the Mekong visit and my patience worn completely thin I decided to go somewhere where the wait wasnt an hour. So headed to LeeLee and decided to try the attached restaurant there. Whats funny is I passed 6 other Pho places along Dobson on my way.. it was a sign!   Being in the mood for beef stew, I was told #48 was beef stew. So, ordered that to go. When I got it home I was shocked to see that it was pan cooked beef chunks with onions and sauce served over the top of lettuce and tomatoes. I was like fuck, that's gross! Well, I had to take a bite, then another, then another, then another.. it was really good! Not the Bo Ko I was craving but tasty none the less. The lettuce had wilted and was similar to a stew cause of all the moisture that was released.. a very good dish!  Ill have to go back to try the pho.. though with all the other pho options I think a tour is in order.. anyone wanna do a Dobson pho tour?

Basic run of the mill Chinese that seems to be geared for the Sun City crowd. Bland and ordinary on most dishes. Family Tofu, Sweet and Sour, Lemon Chicken, gloopy and way to much corn starch in the sauce. Just over all unimpressed. We did ask them to make Chow Fun with beef and green peppers which was very good but "seasonal".. WTF? Seasonal? It's noodles, beef and bell peppers.. what's so seasonal about that?   If in a real pinch and are dying for some Chinese this is probably one of the better Chinese choices in Surprise. At least its not a chain or a buffet!

We were in the area (Pork Shop, Queen Creek Olive Mill) and had a gift certificate (restaurants.com) so decided to stop by and see what someone on AZCentral was going on about. Well that person was loony as Mel Gibson at a traffic stop. This place was just horrible! If it weren't for our friends ( MJ "split-personality" K.'s) and good conversation this would have been a complete loss. The chips were incredibly greasy and the salsa was just alright, super runny tho. Cheese crisp was very yummy (the one star) but the rest, oooof, just nasty! Chicken Torta was dry and horribly bland.. Carne Asado Burrito, chewy fatty meat, no pico and no guacamole! Service was slow and awkward. Our friends ordered fish tacos.. they were certainly from a plastic bag with a man in a yellow rain suit on it!   Just cause there are Mexican making the food there, doesn't mean it's any good.

You know whats really fucked up about this place? Its consistency. For instance, if you eat in the dining room you get a burrito so damn big that you cant finish it! Seriously, this thing was humongous and pretty much full on burrito madness. It tasted alright, very  in line with Chipotle or any other shitty corporate burrito joint, nothing special I assure you except for its girth.    So on our return trip to there airport we deiced to get a burrito but this time ordered it from the counter instead and had it to go. We deiced that we would only order 1 since they are so damn big. I'm not sure if in the 2 days that we gone and came back they had some serious changes or what? This burrito was so chicken shit and terribly small we wondered if there was a problem, kids size maybe? Anyways of course I asked and was told that was the normal to-go size.   That's pretty much bullshit anyway you cut it. If you're going to sell a burrito, sell the same one whether you dine in or take out. So if you're in a pinch like we were, order your food in the dining room from a waiter, NOT to-go.

In a pinch you can always count on Ace Hardware!  I needed some stake tape for my tomato plants and it was a tomato emergency so off to Ace I went.. being that its my local neighborhood store you'd think I would have been in here before. The Mr LOVES this place and is constantly making up reasons to go here.. I think he just likes the Ace points for discounts on future purchases.. anyhoo.. they had the tape and my tomato plants were saved from ruin!   Thank you Ace!! You're my neighborhood hero!

This area is teaming with unique options and real honest to goodness bargains. Stop by Magic Mushroom and get a burger, fries and a can of soda for $5 even. The owners start early in the morning to grind the meat fresh ever day that goes into the burgers, now that's some serious attention to detail. If available, and you're really hungry, try the Fat Ass ($7.50). This burger is just as much fun ordering, as it is eating. A couple of beef patties with all the fixings, plus bacon on a deliciously soft bun, sides of fries, onion rings and 2 sodas, whew! Go Fat Ass!   Inside Two Hippies there's enough tie-dyed, flower child kitsch packed into this place to transport you to the summer of love in one step through the door. Look out Brady's, there's a new bunch in town!

I really think a place has to have most of its components in line before its really going to work. The problem with Jepe is that it needs further development. The staff while friendly enough didn't really seem to care much about the product. When asked what Jepe meant we were told "I don't know and wont make up something stupid".. huh? Maybe more training and understanding is needed?  The product was just okay.. I think I would have been happier with fewer flavors but done really well then a ton of flavors that were just okay. The lemon was decent enough, nice and bright but the other flavors lacked depth and zing that you would normally find in gelato.  Jepe has a ton of flavors.. I tried 5 and of those only 1 was worth the mention.   In the end I just think the place needs a bit more development to be a real winner. I love independents and hope Jepe will find its groove.

When you first walk into this place you'll not smell the delicious cookies baking but of something wet and rotten.. kind of like old gym socks.. was pretty nasty.. so nasty we walked back out but the Mr persevered.. he ordered us a ice cream cookie sandwich and ya know what? It was fucking amazing! 2 super soft and chewy freshly baked cookies with an x-large scoop of vanilla ice cream.. sheer awesomeness! Only 4.75!

It's funny to think that some dough, a little bit of tomato sauce and a few scattered ingredients has our country obsessed with pizza. Estimates say that the pizza industry is worth somewhere around $30 billion dollars annually with over 60,000 pizzerias in the U.S. alone. Better get on that treadmill because each one of us apparently consumes around 23 pounds of pizza per year.  Who says were the chubbiest nation?  With those staggering numbers it's no surprise we have so many pizza joints vying for their piece of the pie. If you have any doubt, just go to famed Pizzeria Bianco on pretty much any night of the week they're open and expect a 2 hour wait minimum, obsession, oh yeah.   Over the past few years I've chowed down on slices from The Parlor in Phoenix, Liberty Market in Gilbert and now my latest favorite La Bocca Urban Pizzeria in Tempe. Situated along bustling Mill Avenue, like it's namesake, La Bocca exudes hip-urban-cool without being pretentious or douchey.   Outside LB there's a spacious patio that's perfect for sipping wine and watching the hunky college boys and girls saunter by. Inside the space is modern, dark and relaxed with low key music playing in the background and old foreign films projecting on the back wall. If you can, call ahead and reserve the orange banquette by the kitchen, probably the most comfortable seat in the house.   Bruschetta Planks ($12) come 4 in an order, but with so many outstanding choices it's hard to choose. Smoked prosciutto, fig, mascarpone cheese and truffle oil was balanced with salty and sweet, but left me wanting more. Pulled pork, housemade pesto and roasted red pepper was on the bland side, though the roasted garlic, goat cheese, arugula and balsamic popped with flavor and texture.  I'd also suggest the smoked sockeye salmon with capers and chef's tartar sauce, reminded me of a dinner version of lox and bagels.   Another great way to start might be with the Med Plate ($14). This is a huge plate filled with basil hummus, babaganoush, warm feta cheese, roasted peppers, queen creek olives, artisan toast, and house made flat bread. The consistency of the hummus was a little thick for my taste but still quite good paired with the creamy feta and salty olives.   I was actually surprised as to how good the pizza really is here. The first taste of the Bocca Trio ($13) revealed with high quality ingredients and charred chewy crust. Topped with crushed San Marzano tomatoes, pepperoni, salami, Schreiner's "sicilian" sausage,  mozzarella, fontina and olives LB's gas fired oven does an amazing job of caramelizing these toppings into a smoky and slightly sweet mouth parade.   There are 7 pizzas to choose from but if you don't see something that suits your fancy, build your own pizza ($8) or calzone ($9). At a $1-$3 each, toppings can add up really fast so select wisely from their 30 or so choices.   The only issue I have with La Bocca is that I didn't visit sooner.

Down home, comforting and above else yummy! The food here goes right to your soul and your waistline! Tried just about everything on the menu as we went with our chef friend who LOVES to try the while menu at places!   Highlights..  Rib tips (mmm, gristle!) Brisket Greens Yams Cabbage Potato Salad Banana Pudding Sweet Potato Pie  All the meats are smothered in a tangy sweet sauce which is very good but should be asked for on the side. This place is really inexpensive and done very well!

Inner Vietnamese woman strikes again!  Who knew that a Vietnamese place can have an upscale feel while still being delicious? The Mr and I finally visited this place and both were pretty much blown away by the space and the food, this certainly raises the ante for the already established Vietnamese places.   Since we have never been before we ordered our asses off the smallish but well written menu. Started with Egg Rolls, these were top drawer complete with fresh lettuce and mint to wrap and dip into the Nc chm, amazingly delicious, fresh and piping hot against the cool veggies.. seriously, food like this can make you horny!   Next up was the Hai nam chicken also known as chicken rice.. outstanding garlic rice with boiled chicken and a ginger dipping sauce. Each bite can be customized with chili and ginger sauce, my mouth is watering just thinking about this dish!!   B√≤ Kho is one of my all time favorite Vietnamese dishes. If you arent familiar its basically a wonderful beef stew with either noodles or french bread. The Pho Ao Sen version is one of the best versions in the valley. You can tell this one is made form scratch, not from a base like other cheater versions around the valley. Each bite was thick and rich with nice pieces of fatty beef and carrot. I only wish they would have added some potato though the egg noodles were just fine by me!   Now what is going to a Vietnamese place without ordering Bun Cha Ha Noi? Pho Ao Sen makes one of the most elegant version Ive seen with a compartmentalized plate showing off each component. This plate both brought us to ooo's and ahhh's.. then the fun begins assembling the rice noodles, bbq pork and the various fresh veggies into a lettuce leaf.. each bite was different from the last by using Nc chm, chile, and hoisen sauce. Simple and delicious!!  Unfortunately we did not see that they serve wine or beer which would have made this place a perfect destination. However they have a nice selection of different beverages including one of my favorites Thai Tea. Sweetened tea topped with milk while basic is great at putting out the chile fires in your mouth! We also tried something we never had before.. Soda Sa Ht G√† which essentially is Vietnamese style eggnog. Egg yolk, sweetened condensed milk, and club soda make for a refreshing and interesting beverage choice. Come on, go out on a limb and try it!!  Pho Ao Sen is fantastically delicious and a new favorite of my inner Vietnamese woman, Ive been missing her greatly of late.

Worst BBQ ever! Bland, flavorless and over priced (see below). We were hoping that this place would be a knock out considering it's just but the house.. to our disappointment this place is horrible.. took a few bites and the pork tasted so old that we tossed the rest in the trash. Whats funny is that the guys working saw us throw the meat out but didn't ask what the problem was.. ah well.. the lemonade here was awesome though.. some of the best lemonade Ive had in ages!   I'm actually surprised that this place isn't out of business yet as its always empty.. a real shame.. we were SO excited when we first saw the banner go up.. maybe they can turn it around before its to late though I'm afraid to go back.  When I say over priced I mean when you order 15 bucks of food then throw it in the trash because it tastes old, then leave hungry, well don't you think thats over priced?

Branching more into unknown territories of International foods Burmese has been on my radar since reading about a wonderful place in San Francisco. So when I heard that there was a Burmese place here in the valley well, I got excited.  The place is awesome! Crossed somewhere between Asian style and Indian style we were all very surprised on how well the food is prepared. We ordered about 13 dishes with our friend (plenty of leftovers) ranging from coconut rice to beef short rib curry. The flavors were great and very unexpected in terms of simple preparation of high quality ingredients.   Standouts were the ginger salad (mixed table side), pork belly curry and the coconut rice. Not only was everything just incredibly tasty but also well priced.   Add another tasty mom and pop owned restaurant to the valley.. its a real winner!

Ho maria maria.. She reminds me of a west side story...Growing up in...spanish harlem...Shes living the life just like a movie star.. "were busy and you'll have to wait for your table but your welcome to sit in the lounge." This is not the way to start out with me.. the thing is the place was busy but I would see there were tons of tables not only on the spacious patio but in the cool looking dining room. After about 10 minutes we were sat! The service was prompt and considering they have been open for only a few  days was running fairly smoothly.   Okay the space at Maria Maria is very cool! Chain, concrete, embossed material on the banquettes and in the back a huge dining room with this cool tree in the center. Loads of candles and a singer playing guitar who is very very good. The place can set a mood for sure.. my only problem with the space are the 2 giant screens paying homage to Carlos Santa but he owns the place so why not, right?  Youre greeted with chips and salsa which is very cool cause I was so hungry! Order a Maria Maria Margarita with a Midori float.. oh yeah, good stuff. But couldn't help but notice that I can make margaritas and salsa better at home, but I'm weird that way. Both were very good for sure and compliment each other nicely.   On to the food.. we ordered duck tacos and a chicken quesadilla for apps.. the duck tacos were the clear winners.. perfect cook non greasy duck meat wrapped in a corn tortilla covered in a red cream sauce.. was sublime. The chicken quesadilla was really good, grilled crispy and not oily at all. Pretty yummy and served with a napalito salsa..  Dinner we ordered Beef Chivichanga and Beef Enchilada's.  The enchiladas were bathed in a smoky complex sauce both creamy and slightly spicy. The Chivichanga was alright.. both were filled were braised short ribs but didn't have the punch we were both expecting. The portions here are very large as we took leftovers home. The Chivichanga could be easily shared as there are 2 on the plate.  The Mr and I were both pleased with the place aside from the first week jitters I'm sure this place will find its groove. Fortunately our server was very calm and collected.. she also had an assistant who was as adorable as he was helpful.   This was a great make up dinner after the mess over at Fines on the Mr's bday.. also cost half as much.   Ho maria maria.. She reminds me of a west side story...Growing up in...spanish harlem...

If you like modern styled furniture without the modern styled prices Eurway is your best bet. Its directly across the street from Ikea in the Emerald Design Center. The service is very friendly and most items are in stock. Great modern style and decent quality.  This sounds like a commercial, uhg!

Nice selection of modern styled furniture and accessories. Less appealing then Eurway way more appealing than Ikea.. kind of in between the 2. Very nice sales staff and they play French pop music which is very cool. If you're on a budget they have some pretty good bargains throughout the store.. the back corner also has many 75% off items. They had this very cool armoire there that I wanted though wherever am I going to fit an armoire in this place. The Mr would have never signed off.. I'm always buy now fit later!

Okay four very large men vs an 80oz steak, who do you think won that battle?   While it was an epic display of man vs food the steak bravely lost to our constant barrage of bites. Honestly, it didn't stand a chance against us. The first to go down were the amazing loaded baked potato mashed potatoes (order that after a few of Brand's delicious Cable Cars). There were vegetables involved somewhere, creamed spinach and killer macaroni and cheese (yes, mac and cheese is a vegetable as far as Im concerned, it doesn't have seeds you know) but those were a mere tasty calm on war our ravaged table. While Ive already described the outcome you should know that it was one tremendously amazing steak. The meat was already removed from the bone for us but that didn't stop me from gnawing on the spoils of war. Medium rare tender supple juicy beefy.  How do you have a steak battle of your own?

I've been craving a Taiwanese beef roll since getting back from LA. So natch I hop on Yelp and start my search for the best beef roll in Vegas. This is the first place ill be trying for that quest. We ordered lots of dishes so its easier to laundry list each.   Beef Roll - After eating a disappointing version in LA (101 Noodle Express) I swore Id find a better one and China Mama didn't disappoint. Lightly crispy and slightly oily pastry dough wrapped around super thin slices of braised beef (tastes like the same beef that's in the beef noodle soup, this is a good thing), cilantro and a sweet and savory sauce thats slightly akin to hoisin. These few ingredients work together to create a deliciously satisfying spindle of flavor.    Juicy Pork Dumplings - AKA Xiao Long Bao, XLB or soup dumplings.. these bite size dumplings are filled with a mixture of ground pork and are brought out in a large steamer. These were pretty good, really porky/soupy and worth ordering but I just wished that they had fresh ginger in their dipping sauce as opposed to ground ginger which was seen floating on top of the sauce. Just be gentle when scooping these up from the steamer as one wrong move with your chopstick will puncture the delicate skin. Trust me, seeing the soup gush out of the bottom of a dumpling and onto the table is a very sad thing.  Pork Boiled Dumplings - These are exactly what you'd expect.. big chubby wontons filled with ground pork sealed and boiled. The juicy pork and the toothsomeness of the wonton made these addictive. It was easier to eat these out of a small bowl with a few drops of black vinegar and chili oil. A must try!   Beef Noodle Soup -  I had no idea that soup bowls here are crazy huge, like you can share between 4 people huge. This isn't quality over quantity either, thick house made noodles treading in a beefy well flavored stock. The depth of flavor was obvious with a hint of spice. If you prefer more heat they can definitely bring you chili oil to enhance your beef noodle experience. Be warned these noodles are slurpy and you will get the collagen rich stock all over your clothes if you're not careful.   Service was attentive though on our visit (Sunday around noon) they were pretty busy with large groups so the kitchen was a little back up. On the way out one of the servers suggested if we love the beef roll to get the pork pockets next time. I cant wait to try a pork pocket!  Oh China Mama, I love you.

QQOM is so much fun to visit! If you're into food, sustainable and local be sure to make your way out to QQOM! The olive oils are extremely good and while a bit on the pricey side (64 bucks a gallon) its worth every penny knowing that you are supporting healthy farm practices and our own local economy.   It just feels good to buy from here!

I haven't been to a Pride event for over 6 years the reason being, every bad choice that you slept with just so happens to be there. You know the walk of shame should only happen once, right?!   In any case, the event was a whole lot of fun.. sort of like a giant gay bar with kids in strollers, LOL! Drinks were 5 bucks which was cool and there were plenty of friends to hang out with.   Very cool things, hats off to the organizers..  1. $5 bucks for drinks, awesome!  2. Diverse selection of things to eat.. hehe..  3. Great entertainment  4. Overall size was great, far larger than 6 years ago  Of course I have a few complaints for the organizers..  1. If you're going to ban "professional" camera equipment, you need to tell everyone that before hand, not at the gate after they've parked a mile away!   2. Need to hire a janitorial service to maintain the port-a-potties and hand washing stations.. later in the afternoon there was no water and no soap, gross. What was even more disgusting were the bloody fucking tampons thrown on the floor of the potties.. I know that's not your fault, however someone constantly maintaining and cleaning the stalls would have been awesome!   3. Not enough shade.. more hang out tents would have been awesome.. even with sunblock I got roasted.. the few shade trees that were there I felt like an Emperor Penguin, packed body to body, constantly rotating in and out of the shade with the attempt to stay cool rather than warm.  Kudos to the organizers and all of the sponsors, a job well done!

You've seen the commercials with Bob Villa.. they really do have some of the best selection and the best prices on flooring. Me and the Mr bought a new cork floor for the guest room at the showroom. You can order online and pick up or have it delivered. The guys there were very friendly as well as seemed to know exactly what they were talking about. The also offer install service if you're not that handy.

What a great office!   I threw my back out last week working in the yard, I know not as exciting as a car accident or street brawl. I waited a week hoping that it would get better but each day the same thing would happen, wake up and it felt fine then after standing for a few minutes the stiffness and soreness would come creeping back. So enough was enough.   So I decided to search Yelp for a good chiro and stumbled upon Dr. Reiss and Southern Nevada Chiropractic. I was immediately greeted by Ashley (office manager) who was super friendly and outgoing. From there she had me fill out a few forms and within a few minutes was being examined by Dr. Reiss. He has some very cool technology that he uses to diagnose my problem. In no time he got my back straightened out and then armed me with a daily routine of stretches and exercises to help prevent this from happening again.   If you ever mess your back up and you need a pro who knows what he's doing, give Southern Nevada Chiropractic a call. They take most major insurance but if you don't have insurance their pricing is reasonable. Stay healthy!

Aside from the girl behind the counter being rude to us.. then our sliders not having cheese on them as ordered and paid for... it was a delight to watch the owner berate her in front of us when we brought the sliders back in and asked for the cheese we paid for! However, once we got the sliders back to my friends house we were both very disappointed that the sliders were completely unseasoned and lacked that delicious salty slider taste that were accustomed too.   I also order a loaded Chicago Dog which I ate almost immediately, soggy wet mess, yes made by the same girl.. you know, it only takes one bad employee to ruin an experience forever. Will probably not return as I made a special trip to check this place out after so many favorable reviews.   I'm still so very disappointed, love sliders.

So we've been hearing all sorts of buzz about Culver's.. the famous butter burger and frozen custard place from Wisconsin. So we piled in the car and headed out to Mesa. When we got there the place was packed.. we stood in line for 10 minutes before it was our turn. The service is very friendly and super helpful. We even ordered the flavor of the day, caramel cashew swirls and were told we could pick that up later so it didn't melt while we ate our dinner.. that was very cool!  Anyway, you place your order and they give you a number so they can bring it out to you when its ready.. another nice touch. Well after we got our food, butter burgers, fries and cheese curds we felt well, kind of let down. The burgers here are alright, kinda greasy and lacked a good beef flavor. The cheese curds were also deep fried (as most on the menu) and were good but not as good as I was hoping.   The crowd there.. it was like I was in Iowa or something.. definite Walmart crowd.. I sat there and watched this kid pick his nose and then proceed to fill his soda cup from the soft drink fountain.. uhm, yeah.. I just looked at my cup and thought about all the other people who touched that button.. suddenly didn't feel very good.   We got our frozen custards.. eh, very very smooth and creamy but to me just tasted like ordinary soft serve ice cream. Cashews were salty and nicely roasted, a good contrast to the smooth custard but lack depth and interest in the overall taste of the frozen custard.  I probably wouldn't ever go back here.. though the service is great and is priced well, I just don't think the food was worth the drive back out to Mesa.

Alright just to warn you up front.. this place in the smack dab in the middle of Sun City West.. the parking lot is full of golf carts and bunny rabbits as well as quail and other forms of Arizona wildlife.   In any case this place is pretty darn good! If you want a heart attack on a plate be sure to order the Chicken Club.. HUGE fried chicken breast covered in ham, bacon and cheddar cheese.. all served on a potato bun. Good stuff! Excellent onion rings as well!   Its like eating with 50 pairs of grandma and grandpa's! Nice and comfortable!!

Not sure what happened to this place.. used to be really good though last night it was on the verge of inedible. Everything from the normally light and delicious onion rings to the crispy chicken club were greasy as all get out. Dillons used to do fried so well keeping it light, crispy and not greasy at all. The waitress while sort of nice was so slow! On top of this kitchen and service issues the old people in there were so trashed and so loud. I literally watched this old woman with a huge fanny pack stagger out the door with her keys in hand. Gawd I hope I dont suck that much when I become an old codger!    Still very disappointed about my last visit, not sure if Id go back.

Okay, after barfing all over my shirt following the Yelp event (I drank WAY to much!) I decided that mama needed a new shirt. I'm always impressed how service is just all over the place here. Sometimes it friendly and attentive while other times its some punk with his pants below his ass. Why do punk kids where their pants like that? Is it for easy access to their 'back door'? Yuck!  Today, good service and great selection! Moma didn't find a shirt tho I can never leave here without getting a few new pairs of CK undies off the clearance table. Yes, I shop clearance and am proud of it!!

You can always count on a good bargain at Target.. from toilet paper to toothpaste I cant imagine getting this stuff from anywhere else. Plus I have a little secret.. each department has a clearance area.. be sure to seek those out for the best deals. I just got a pair of Mossimo Cargo Shorts for 4 bucks!! I sure love a great bargain!

I feel so much angst and irritation when leaving here.. not sure why I even bother. They TOTALLY screw you on your game trades.. their retail prices are FULL RETAIL.. so their prices suck.. the kids behind the counter are generally douche bags. However, what am I going to do with the games I don't play anymore? Let them become clutter around here.. oh hell no! They'll all go to Game Stop so I can have something to complain about! OMG, I sound like my mother!

Pretty darn amazing for a vegetarian menu! The owner was super friendly and I told her how much I love spicy fare.. she took care of me!!  I ordered the Kung Pao Soy Chicken.. you don't even miss the chicken at all.. nice and spicy sweet with LOADS of veggies!! Also ordered the Imperial Roll Noodles.. yummy! I didn't even miss the BBQ pork that usually comes with this dish elsewhere. Lots of pieces of egg rolls amongst fresh cabbage and rice noodles.. she also threw in some Thai chiles.. my mouth, my mouth, my mouth is on fire!   Can't wait go come back!!

Maizie's has it all.. cool space.. wonderful service.. accessible menu.. well priced.   Had the Bleu inside out burger.. very tasty and super juicy! WARNING! These burgers are stuffed.. meaning all the cheese is on the inside.. if you get a blow out (like I did) you're screwed! I burnt the hell out of my hand on the first bite.. the molten cheese sprayed all over my hand as the burger patty blew out the side. OMG, that was so fucking painful.. my first instinct was to lick it off (I don't waste cheese) but I'm sure that would have blistered my mouth. So word of caution.. eat these carefully. My hand was tender the rest of the evening but nothing a glass of wine didn't help. I should have told the server but didn't want her to feel bad about it. Though they need to add a warning label!!  The strawberry cake in the parfait glass was pretty tasty as well.. so save room!  Tasty but dangerous!!

Sometimes I can be a craft whore.. seeking out fabrics for cushions, curtains and what have you. So when my lil' craft whore rears her pretty little whore head she heads off to Jo-Ann.. she knows she will get the best prices and discounts on all her craft and fabric needs. They also have a fantastic selection of canvases and painting supplies.. must keep the crafty whore happy and delighted!

If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense. Nothing would be what it is because everything would be what it isn't. And contrary-wise; what it is it wouldn't be, and what it wouldn't be, it would. You see?   Everything here seems what it would be but isn't.. its very unexpected and surprising though not great but very good. The service is super though.. very helpful, sharp and smart.  Looking forward to going back to Eddie's where you feel like the Cheshire Cat will come out at any second.

Been wanting to try this place for some time to see what was up.. the only thing I can say is that I'm sorry.. so sorry for not coming here sooner. Yes, this place is in the hood and is smaller than a postage stamp but is so good that you can brave the seedy location for one night.   There are several pasta's on the menu but only a handful are handmade. We had the gnocci in the vodka sauce as well as the cheese ravioli.. come on, these are so good.. like crazy yummy good! The creamy sauce paired well with the perfectly prepared pasta's.. eyes were rolled back into our heads!!   For our main course we ordered the meatball Metro.. this pizza is HUGE.. check out the pics! for 25 bucks this monster is worth every penny.. sweet chunky tomato sauce with fresh mozzarella and little chunks of meatball.. the crust was a little bit salty in a good way.. the crust could have been enjoyed on its own!   In the end this place so many wonderful elements.. fast personal service, great pricing and wonderful eats. Its a real winner!! Cant wait to try the new location over on our side of town.

So we wandered in here after having Z Pizza.. whats funny is Z Pizza is all about organic and fresh and this place is not.. it used to be the milk would travel form the US to Hawaii where they'd make the ice cream then ship it back to the US for sale. Now I think its all just made in California.   They really should consider a different supplier.. sorry but Dryer's Grand is actually a step up from their product. We tried the vanilla yogurt and scraped it off into the garbage.. pretty horrible!!! The Blueberry Cheesecake was alright but again Dryer's version actually tastes better.. harsh, huh? The girl behind the counter was so sweet though..   Next time I'll skip this place and just head to Safeway.. a half gallon of Dryer's Grand is under 6 bucks, tastes better and will serve at least 6!

Upfront.. the owners of Sweet Republic are good friends of me and the Mr.. so its that awkward position that I didn't really think about until now. To Yelp or not to Yelp, that is the question. The thing is you feel you want to give their business 5 stars but perhaps risk your Yelp integrity because they are friends of yours. The cool thing is that they are both Yelpers as well so they understand!!   Let me tell you.. Sweet Republic is not a chain.. its local, natural and delicious. Last night the Mr and I were so in the mood for ice cream we surprised our friends by just showing up. We hadn't been in the space since it was still under construction but let me say that the store turned out great! A tight and bright modern comfort feeling comes over you as soon as you walk in the door. In fact Bizzare Love Triangle was playing as we walked in.. I used to love that song! We immediately were greeted by 2 beautiful smiling faces.. so add warm to the store as well!  be sure to look down.. the concrete floors are striking!  Immediately me and the Mr got our game on.. SR offers several varieties of sorbet, ice cream and a small assortment of baked goods.. ALL made on premises! (love locals!) We started with tastings of Lime and Basil sorbet, followed by Pear and Ginger then Coconut.. the coconut sorbet was some of the best Ive tried.. in fact it was the only Ive ever tried. Rich and creamy for sorbet with pieces of shredded coconut.. just wonderful!  We moved onto ice cream.. me and the Mr can be quite gluttonous when something is good.. I think we sampled most of the flavors of ice cream but the shining star was the Salted Carmel!! Seriously good stuff here! You know how some people can compare certain foods with sexual experiences.. this for me was one of them.. creamy, rich, sweet, slightly salty, chewy goodness! If you have anything have this one.. I know it'll be a claim to fame as it's done so well!  SR also makes frozen yogurt. Not the super sweet, super tangy variety you find at the Pinkberry clones but a subtly flavored low sweetness froyo. They even make their own yogurt.. we're talking ground up here kids.. no corners cut! They offer a variety of toppings both for the frozen yogurt and the ice cream.. though because they are as natural as possible you wont find neon colored kid cereal but healthy granola, fruits and sauces. This makes them truly different since they are doing exactly what they believe in.   Let's not forget the small assortment of baked goods.. we only tried the meringues.. delicious! The cookies and banana bread looked awesome.. next time! In the cold case they also have some pints prepacked as well as a few house made frozen novelties. The brownie cookie ice cream sandwich will be the next thing I try!!  If you like wholesome, natural and yummy this will be a great place to spend some time. They even have free wifi so you can 'chill' for a while!  I hope I did them justice without being overly gushy as well as loyal to my Yelp integrity.

I'm sitting here thinking about all the wonderful things that Jan and Helen make at Sweet Republic. They both work so hard to make sure that everyone who visits has a great experience at their store.. the last time I visited I had a frozen yogurt (gotta watch my bearish figure) and it was the smoothest, creamiest and tastiest frozen yogurt Ive had. Even after visiting Pinkberry a few weeks back I realized just how much better their product is. I know that when they make any of their tasty creations its honest to goodness.

I have to say that I'm such a frozen yogurt junkie! Ive been driving by Ice Tango daily waiting for the day they finally open. Well, its finally here.. they opened a few hours ago and there was just about a line out the door. I didn't realize how many fro-yo junkies were out there waiting, hoping and wishing they would open their newest location!   Tonight being there first night I have to tip my hat to Dave and family. They have managed to put out as good of a product as they have over at the North Scottsdale location. I had the twangy yogurt topped with Fruity Pebbles and mochi.. you know for me its all about textures and flavors. Something about the sweet tart yogurt up against the crunch of the pebbles and the soft chewiness of the mochi that just gets me going.   Ice Tango is truly a delight and I'm just so excited that they are only about a mile or so from the house. You guys just rock my world!

This is the place, the place, the place to stuff your face! Hot, crispy, juicy, salty madness! Its the place for fried chicken! Oh and the sauce, get an extra sauce, like a creole sweet mustard with perhaps some mayo in it. Its slatherable love!

In Surprise there are quite a few pizza places.. surprisingly many independents! LS is certainly another one to add to the delicious selections in the far west valley!  We had the deep dish pizza.. okay, a bottom crust then they fill it with your toppings and cheese.. then they add a second crust and bake it off.. after which they add their red sauce into the well.. its more like a pie.. since there aren't to many places doing it this way my hat is WAY off for these guys. The sauce however is a bit to sweet for me so, next time it goes on the side.   Also had the chicken cesar salad.. I was expecting grilled chicken but ended up being lightly coated and crispy.. was SO good!   So there are still some surprises in Surprise. Not that many Yelpers will go here but its nice to know that there is more out in the west then bog box stores and chain restaurants.

The City of Angles, Los Angles, has to be one of my favorite foodie destinations. Pretty much every food trend over the past 5 years or so has its epicenter in LA. From Korean style frozen yogurt to cupcakes and now food trucks, the people of LA know a good thing when they taste it. While all of these trends have some how made their way to the Valley of the Sun, there's one thing that I've never been able to find here, garlic sauce like the one that's served at the LA institution Zankou Chicken.    If you've heard of Zankou and its amazing Lebanese chicken and tangy fluffy garlic sauce you know exactly what I mean when I say it's ethereal. For those who've never tried it either pack an overnight bag and head to LA or drive down to 20th Street and Van Buren to Al-Hana inside of Baiz market, its the closest thing to Zankou Chicken in Phoenix and its close location makes it even better.  The area located around Baiz Market might seem a little rough around the edges but the market itself is clean, well lit and packed with all sorts of interesting Middle Eastern grocery items from dairy and fresh produce to meat and hookah paraphernalia. Tucked in the corner of the market is Al-Hana, a postage stamp sized restaurant specializing in, you guessed it Middle Eastern cooking.   While the offerings might seem typical the flavors are bold and shouldn't be missed. The creamy roasted eggplant dip Babaghannuj ($4.49) had a smokiness usually not found in many other places. Al-Hana leaves their version thick and chunky with just the right amount of olive oil drizzled over the top.   Ordering the Falafel Plate ($5.99) will get you 6 deep fried cumin scented pucks of ground chickpeas and fava beans. Pile a couple of these onto a freshly baked pita, slather with tahini and enjoy the crunch. Id also highly recommend the Labneh Pie ($2.99) which is filled with labneh, a Lebanese cream cheese, onions and tomatoes all baked in a light tender crust.   The main dish for me was of course the Whole Roasted Chicken ($9.99). It comes with pita, pickles and garlic sauce. The chicken itself is so well seasoned and juicy it would seem like a crime to adorn it with anything until you get some garlic sauce on it. The texture is light and fluffy, almost like a garlicky mayonnaise. After one taste you might ask them for another container, seriously delicious.   After a wonderful meal you'd think there wouldn't be enough room left for desert, but my rule is there's always room. With that I sauntered to the back of Baiz Market where their in store bakery is located, most of the case filled delights are around $2 each including a flaky syrup soaked baklava.   While I love LA, knowing that I don't have to drive 300 miles to get my garlic sauce fix makes the drive across town all the tastier.   Al-Hana inside Baiz Market Open Daily

I really should give this place a break since it is opening day but with a chain should there really be growing pains? Dickie's is a national chain with tens of stores.. should they be out of pulled pork? Potato Salad? Dirty tables and condiment area? Should the staff be rough around the edges? You know them not having pulled pork is like McDonald's being out of Big Macs!  Eating here lead to more questions then it did answers. Why were the ribs like jerky? Or the beef brisket moist tender and juicy? The food was just all over the place in terms of its preparation. There was a very steady stream of customers who seemed very happy that they were open. Of course I had a cloud above my head and wondered why a chain with so many stores was so off?  Not sure if there will be a repeat visit anytime soon.. perhaps in a few weeks or months they will get it all 'pulled' together? Ouch!

So my weekly travels takes me to not only 3 LA Fitnesses a week but let's me see how vastly different each location is cared for. Of the 3 I go to this location is the best kept in cleanliness and organization. The locker room smells clean unlike some of the others that smell like sweaty balls and ass.. the showers are immaculate and have been kept up since opening 5+ years ago.   Not much eye candy at 4am which is cool by me since that means no waiting for anything. Maybe 4 people there when I go and they are mostly doing cardio. I wish all the location were like this.. its one of the few locations that I don't feel like I have to take a shower after taking a shower!

Only open for breakfast and lunch, Hero Factory caters to the downtown Phoenix lunch crowd with humongous, top of the line hero sandwiches. With veteran deli owners Nicole Dorio and Jay Friedman, quality and freshness are high while the prices are low. Hero only uses Boar's Head meats and cheeses, which you've probably seen before in the expensive side of the grocery store meat counters. This makes all of the difference in quality comparison to the places, left unnamed, who sell $5 subs. You'll notice the difference! Then there is the bread! Covered with toasted sesame seeds, the toothsome bread has a light bagel texture, slightly chewy while remaining tender. No wonder since the bread is sourced from our own local Chompies bakery.  When you set foot inside the first thing you're going to notice is the smell. A mixture of onions, meat and tomato sauce fragrances permeate the air inside causing an instant and raging hunger. The deli counter is broken up into 3 different areas, each more moth watering then the next. The first case is filled with all sorts of delectable salads and desserts. Then there is the meat and cheese case, where the owners slice the meat to order whether for a sandwich or by the pound. Then there is the hot section which has steaming hot dishes of deli classics like sausage and peppers and meatballs, the fantastically overwhelming smell was quickly fingered.   Ordering can be a bit tough due to the fact that everything sounds so wonderful. Signature Heroes both cold and hot, wraps, salads and sides make up the large and straight forward menu. Place your order at the counter, pay, then grab a seat and you'll be called when its ready. Once this process is started you can watch as your meat is sliced and your sandwich assembled. Ive always enjoyed watching my food prepared, you can learn so much for your own kitchen. Yes, Ive already ordered my very own meat slicer so I can do this at home on the weekends when Hero is closed.  The heroes at Hero are big, thick and piled heavy with meat, cheese and toppings. 2 big eaters can easily share 1 hero sandwich and a side no problem. Being the big bear that I am I did barely manage to finish one by myself and was quite miserable for sometime after that. Fortunately parking in downtown Phoenix is kind of spread out so a nice walk afterwards will really help out. The easiest method would be to park in mid town then take the light rail to the Hero Factory, it runs right by.  With so many heroes to chose from I went ahead and put my trust in the owner Jay. He immediately tells me that his favorite hero is the Manhattan ($7.95). Anything with "man" in it has to be good, right? A thick stack of roast beef piled high on toasted garlic bread all covered with melted mozzarella cheese. This sandwich was in its most pure form, no veggies and sauces to get in the way, just the simple flavor of good meat, cheese and bread. When he came to check on his sandwich I asked for some Russian dressing for a bit of a variation, this single element added that extra dimension that turned the Manhattan from good to great! Their Russian dressing is some of the best I've had. They really should bottle and sell this dressing, can't wait to try it on a salad! Of course the owner is going to know what's best to eat off of his menu. It was great that he didn't say the generic phrase, "everything is good on the menu".  Taking matters in my own hands, next up was the Crackerjack ($7.95). While not as anti-holiday as I was looking for this one was simply fantastic! Thin sliced cracked pepper turkey, oozy melted pepper jack cheese then dressed with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and their amazing Russian dressing. Each bite of the spicy turkey and cheese was a hard contrast to the sweet flavors of the holiday; this one definitely has some heat to it. If something all American is more your liking, then the Patriot ($7.95) will be a home run! Roast Beef, turkey, ham and American cheese topped with lettuce, tomato and onion. You can never go wrong with the basics at Hero.  What's a deli without trying some of the home made salads? The cheese and bacon tortellini salad ($1.75 1/2lb) was so creamy, smoky and tender, one taste was not enough. In fact this one was so good I didn't want to share with my table mates. The deli case also had a tomato and mozzarella salad ($1.75 1/2lb) that was perfectly dressed with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Each cherry tomato exploded with sweet tangy flavor contrasted by the balsamic coated mozzarella, delightful.  The hours at Hero are limited to weekday mornings and afternoons which may be the only drawback to his location. Since the light rail is moving finally and more businesses are opening downtown, perhaps the hours will include a Saturday? I sure hope so, I really love this place!

Just got home from Imagine Spain.. while Ive never been to Spain so I cant compare, I can certainly imagine it quite easily after all the wonderful things we had this evening. We ordered 16 items in all.. practically one of each off the hot and cold menus as well as a paella.. we ate EVERYTHING! Was so tasty.. there was this tuna and eggplant dish that was so amazingly fresh and savory.. couldn't get enough! A couple of the tapas could have used a little bit of sea salt.. which might be a nice little touch later on.. a small finger bowl of Spanish sea salt.. yum!   The seafood paella was cooked perfectly, all the way to the crispy little caramelized bits on the side and bottom of the pan..   now that's some serious tongue love right there!!  All these items came out to be around 130 bucks.. VERY well priced! Imagine Spain is a real treat and joy.. try this place before the word gets out and is packed every weekend!

How did they come to this? "Tag's" used to be one of my favorite Italian haunts back in the day. The food quality has suffered so much over the years and Im not even sure they are aware of it. I got a coupon yesterday for 20% off and figured what the hell, will be in the 'hood.  Got a baked spaghetti, and a bbq chicken stromboli.. the sauce on the spaghetti was pretty bland.. this was my "go to" dish before they started sucking. The meatballs were well cooked but the spaghetti itself was pretty tasteless as well. The bbq chicken stramboli was a hot mess. I'm VERY particular about chicken, especially when its precooked and hanging out.. the chicken breast was tender but very old, you could taste the fridge funk! Their bbq sauce isn't really bbq sauce, just some weird sweet goo.. no real texture to this dish, very disappointing.  I'm so disappointed with them right now Ill probably never go back. There was a time and a place when they were pretty awesome.. however since expanding they've just never been the same. Expansion sucks!

From the time you enter till the time you depart, Christopher's exudes a comfortable luxury. Sleek elegant lighting casts upon gorgeous wood and glass surfaces accented with pops of orange and brown. Deep overstuffed chairs that cradle and beckon you to stay a while longer. These elements combined with a James Beard award winning chef sets the stage for romance and sophistication.  Chef-owner Christopher Gross' latest restaurant is located in the updated Biltmore Fashion Park adjacent to Sak's Fifth Avenue. Main parking can be intolerable and downright frustrating, though if you enter towards the back, there is plenty of good parking in the structure.   Beyond the warm greeting from the hosts, there are 2 distinct spaces in the restaurant; one side is Christopher's and the other Crush lounge. At Crush, have a seat in one of the cushy banquettes and enjoy a menu of small plates, pizzas and wine. On the other side, Christopher's is the more formal dining space and while sophisticated is by no means stuffy.   Christopher's menu is mostly French inspired, though I think of it as well traveled with hints of Italian and Asian. Chef Gross' worldliness comes from positions in Paris, London and Normandy. With so much expertise, it's no wonder he has been awarded so many accolades, including afore mentioned James Beard award for Best Chef Southwest.  Ordering up some "First Plates" to share, Alsatian onion tart, ($14) a rectangle of flaky puff pastry adorned with sweet caramelized onions, bacon and a salad of fris√©e dressed with pungent vinaigrette will awaken your palette. I could have easily eaten the whole thing rather than just a few bites.   Creamy Terrine of Hudson Valley Foie Gras ($24) was neatly placed along side a brandied date tart, points of toasted brioche and a drizzle of Pedro Xim√©nez wine reduction. This was slow eating at its finest as I built each component onto the end of my fork.   A salad composed with delightfully salty Duck Confit ($16) mixed greens, Humboldt Fog cheese and Cognac infused cherries was a triumph. But the Butter Poached Lobster ($18) with fresh greens, pine nuts and roasted fennel vinaigrette was better and now my new favorite.   How about a few suggestions for your main course? Definitely the smoked truffle infused Filet Mignon ($36), tender, earthy and ambrosial. We also enjoyed the 12 oz. New York Steak ($34), cast iron seared and pepper-crusted. Heightened with cracked pepper, the beef flavor was piquant and juicy.  Consider a few sides too, such as the Mac n'Cheese Au Gratin ($7) with velvety cream sauce spiked with ham or the additively smooth Gruy√®re Pommes Pur√©e ($7). And maybe a vegetable, the Brussels Sprouts ($7) were a special that night, deliciously bitter and sweet.  While the fare was delightful and service professional, each course became more strained as the night wore on with our waiter disappearing for long periods of time. Finally having to ask for the check, we decided to skip the sweets, there simply wasn't room.  Chef Gross has it going on here, fantastic food, a great wine list and most of all my new favorite date spot.

After seeing Gabi's review of Miami Rice I was VERY intrigued.. always looking for something new and different went on her word (and the advice of the other reviews). I can sum this one up really easily.. OMFG! The place is off the f-ing hook! As you can tell I'm very excited.. while I love ice cream and fro-yo this was just so different from that realm of dessert goodness.   The staff was SO friendly and outgoing which was so refreshing and delightful! You can sample each flavor to see which one is going to be a home run for your creation. ALL were so good but I narrowed it down to 2, the coconut and the cheesecake.. both were out-fing-standing! The 2 flavors were then topped with vanilla frozen yogurt which was so creamy and smooth (no this fro-yo is not tangy at all).. this was the perfect dessert.. superb texture variation and mouth feel.   This really took me back.. when I was a kid my mother would take us all to a buffet called Duff's. For dessert I would get a bowl of vanilla ice cream, cover it with tapioca and then ladle the sauce off the bread pudding right on top. Just heavenly.. this is as close to those fond memories I still carry with me close to my heart.   I love Miami Rice.. just appealed to me on so many levels.

LOVE District! A welcome addition to an otherwise dismal selection at the Arizona Center. We found all the food excellent except for the bread, that come from Simply Bread, of course that sucked.   Highlights.. Shrimp Po Boy, Chicken Pot Pie, BBQ Pork loin, Tomato Soup, Pumpkin Whoopie Pie..  Lowlights.. chow chow (pickled veggies) and the bread.  Well priced.. good price and a comfortable space that takes reservations!

It's Subway.. not much else I can say except that this one has a real asshole working the cash register.. the guy who made my sub was nice enough but stark contrast to the cashier jerk off. When I was 18 years old I loved working, seems like this kid not only hated his job but didn't care for any of its customers either.   The stars are for the sandwich, spinach and the guy who made mine. Otherwise Ill probably only go to the one next to work, if I have to.

You can never have enough fresh tasty Mexican places around.. even in north Scottsdale. Let me tell you, this place is very tasty! Everything is made right there in the open kitchen and if you sit at the bar you can see how fresh it all is.   The Mr and I were hungry so we ordered way to much food. We had no idea that the portions were so large. Started with the Parrillada Tampiquena for 2.. a huge sizzling platter of meaty goodness! Steak, chicken, carnitas and chorizo.. served with tortillas, rice, beans.. well you get the picture.. a mother load of food for 12.99.. this is enough for 2 healthy eaters. Me and the Mr being healthy eaters we continued to over gorge ourselves.. steak quesadilla and a carnitas burrito.. both were large and stuffed with tasty meat!   If you love some thick juicy meat like I do, this place is a perfect fit!!

La's occupies the former Pho Tay Do space though they have done a great job of updating with wood paneling and paint. The Mr and I love Thai food so it's been on our radar for some time. So after finally trying it we've decided it's our new favorite Thai place.   The elements are working to their benefit.. friendly service, great prices and large portions of high quality ingredients. We started with 2 salads, huge mistake. The salads are so large that we could have just split one but no.. we ordered the Larb (ground meat salad) as well as the Yum-Woon-Sen (ground meat and glass noodle salad). Just a heads up, if you don't like fish sauce be sure to ask them not to use it. We also asked for them to be hot.. you'll have to love spice cause these are HOT!!.. I had tears running down my face, it was so spicy! Awesome!! Both salads were tasty just make sure you ask about the fish sauce.  We also tried the Fresh Rolls.. you know the drill, rice paper housing noodles shrimp etc.. these were very fresh and tasty though the peanut dipping sauce was phenomenal! Then paired with the roasted chile powder added a complex smokiness to each bite.. Ill be going back for these for sure!!  Entree's.. the Mr ordered Pad Thai, while very very good it was still just pad Thai.. I ordered Kang-Kra-Ri which was a yellow curry with tofu, coconut milk, pumpkin, potatoes and onions.. oh hell yeah! This was one of the best curries Ive had in a very long time! Silky smooth creamy goodness!   You know us.. we over ordered way to much food which was alright here cause now we have lunch for tomorrow! Woohoo! Im such a porker!

Amazing selection of meats, cheeses, kitchen equipment and chefs jackets.. everything you will need to run your restaurant.. even pizza sauce by the gallon.   The downside.. you have to have a membership or know someone who has one to get in.. the upside, no crowds and no free samples like Costco.. nothing worse than trying to avoid a line of people volleying for free food!

In Surprise this is probably the best Chinese offering which isnt saying a whole lot. I really wish there was an awesome offering out there in terms of Chinese food.. Mexican food, oh yeah, some very good places mostly but Asian, youre better off staying at home and cooking.   We ordered the Asian Chicken Salad, chicken was old and had that old gross fridge taste.. Dan Dan Noodle, the noodles were over cooked and stuck together as one large soggy noodle.. Curry with Tofu, the curry had a weird perfume taste.. the honey chicken was pretty good as well as the hot and sour soup though neither made for good leftovers.   With Surprise having so many chains it wasnt surprising to see one of these finally opening up.. a far better choice than Panda Express.. kind of sad, huh?

I have to go on the record as saying that this place is great! The Mr and I were out in QC picking up porky bits at the Pork Shop and wanted to try something new out there. Seeing that this place has been on my radar for ages it was about to to give it a try. I am kind of surprised that no one has been out here and Yelped it yet. This place is amazing!! Chef driven, artisan, seasonal menu and specials with great pricing it doesn't get much better than this.   After browsing their farmers market (Saturdays only) and being greeted by an really super nice guy (I'm presuming one of the owners) we had a really good vibe on the place. The inside is both comfortable and relaxed with Led Zepplin and the Beatles playing in the background. We started with the Warm Prosciutto Wrapped House Made Mozzarella ($4.50).. all I have to say is that I wish I had a nice glass of red to go with this tasty treat! The prosciutto was awesome but the house pulled mozzarella, to die for! In fact it was so good we asked to buy a pound to go! On the plate was also a nice slathering of pesto to compliment each bite.. this stuff should be jarred and sold! If I wouldn't come off as rude and desperate I would have easily licked the plate.  Next up we shared a side of their house made dill pickles ($1.50).. a nice bowl filled with tender well spiced pickles.. man, I sure love a nice pickle! Juicy with slightly crunchy tenderness these were so good I just about scarfed the bowl myself. Next up we ordered Marinated Mushroom ($3.50) which came with toasted slices of Simply Bread cibatta. Each tender bite was a flavor explosion of earthy sweet balsamic tastiness, here comes that wine craving again. The deal here is that I'm low carbin' so it took some restraint not to tear into the bread with the mushrooms. Fortunately the Mr isnt low carbin' so I was able to live vicariously through him, he shook his head in pleasure.    Up next were our lunch entrees, the Mr had the 1/2 Cuban Sandwich and a bowl of soup ($9). The soup was sausage white bean that I could smell from across the table. He went ahead and got me a nice spoon full of seasoned broth and a large thick slice of sausage. Okay there is soup and there is soup, this was excellent. Hot, creamy and deeply satisfying this was one of the quality your Italian grandmother would have made for you as a kid! The Cuban sandwich was huge tender slices of Roast Pork, Ham melted Provolone, House Sweet Pickles, Dijon Aioli on Ciabatta Bread. Uh, come on now, seriously? This is just about everything you could ask for in a sandwhich. Chewy fresh baked bread, hot slices of slightly salty meats and melted cheese, major love was dripping from this sandwich.  My lunch was the Chopped Chef Salad w/ Romaine Hearts, Turkey, Bacon, Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Egg, Red Onion, Avocado & Blue Cheese Dressing ($12). Low cabin' doesn't get much better than this! Each bite was absolutely different with combination of so many fresh and tasty ingredients. Pay close attention to the turkey, they roast it in house along with the roast pork in the Cuban. They take simple ingredients and combine them to create such delicious hearty flavors all working in unison.   While The Deli is out of the way it is so worth the drive to Queen Creek for lunch or dinner. Please take the drive, I seriously don't think you're going to be disappointed one bit!

Lauren R. did a great job explaining how these bad boys are served! She's right on the money and so are these! Seriously, some of the best hot dogs in town are here.. not topped with bacon but wrapped in bacon.. the hot dogs are not cooked on site but at a local commissary where they can legally cook bacon wrapped hot dogs. It is very much illegal not only in Arizona but in California to cook hot dogs on the street in this manor. In fact there was a lady in LA who was actually arrested for cooking and serving them this way.   Anyway, enough with the education.. stop by and eat one, keep this cart going, amazing hot dogs and friendly people running this one!! Oh and they have real Mexican coke, with sugar, no HFCS!

You can see how awesome this place is going to be. However the owners need to make sure they maintain the place. After going Friday night then returning Saturday morning the parking lot was already trashed. Though there were a ton of people there.. it was a fucking zoo!

This was our second stop on our Mekong food crawl.. after waiting for about 15 minutes with one person ahead of us we finally placed our order. I cant tell you how close we were to walking out and just going across the street to ACE.. well we persevered..  Here is why the food takes so long to come out.. they que the orders up and try to make all like dishes at the same time, no matter how long youve been there.. if you ordered Peddler soup and 4 tables behind you ordered Peddler soup, you will be waiting until they get to that dish on the ticket.. its bullshit!   Anyway, one order came out, was the pork chop and rice box.. while the pork chop looked good it was pretty lame. Tea egg was fine but it was just a tea egg.. the cabbage salad was warm and pretty boring.  After about 15 minutes the other 2 dishes arrived.. the beef stew over rice was prepared in this overly thick gelatinous goo.. while the meat texture was good the overall flavor and appearance was pretty nasty. The other dish, chicken in chiles was pretty ordinary and wasn't spicy at all. Kinf of surprising since the dish was covered in chiles.. though I think they may have been old.   Even the boba Thai tea was thin, watered down and not very good. Was so not worth the wait! After a few bites of each we ended up leaving and went across the street to ACE for some decent Asian food..   What a complete waste of time.

In my search to the ends of the Valley for hidden gems for great food I've found a pocket of Asian ethnicity in Mesa.  Mekong Plaza opened in October 2008 on the southwest corner of Dobson and Main. Formerly an empty Target store, it has been converted into an Asian mall with Mekong Market as the anchor. The plaza houses three Vietnamese restaurants, one Thai and the Taiwanese place, Taiwan Food Express.  If you're unfamiliar with Taiwanese food, that would make two of us.  While Taiwan Food Express does have a China-merican menu with typical offerings, I'd suggest ordering from the regular menu and the specials menu. This will give you food that seems authentic and interesting.  This was probably one of the most exciting dinners I've had in quite some time. Taiwanese cooking has many influences including regional, ethnic and cultural influences. So in order to taste the diversity, we ordered as many dishes as the table could hold and then some.  If you're not feeling too brave, feel free to ask for suggestions, the employees here know all the good stuff. Our server, Jessica, made some great suggestions as we pulled a feast together. And at these prices - nothing is more than $10 -- feast away!  The Spicy Wontons ($2.50) are filled with tender seasoned ground pork then laid to rest in spicy chili oil. They were so tasty we ended up ordering a second plate.  Not being able to resist any sort of food challenge, we tried the Simmered Pig Ear ($2.50). It was funny to watch the look on the faces of each of my dining companions as they raised the wiggly sliced ears to their mouths. These were more of a texture food than a taste food. The ear skin was super tender while the center cartilage was on the crunchy side. Challenge won.  Less challenging was the scrumptious Beef Roll ($3.95). A tender pancake rolled around tender sliced beef with a slathering of sweetened soy sauce was slightly oily, but nothing a napkin couldn't fix.  The Scallion Pancake ($2.25) had a decent crunch and made a great bread to go along with the upcoming entrees.  A less adventurous diner might order the familiar Orange Chicken ($6.50). It's good choice here. The tender batter covered fried chicken was accented by a thick and pungent sauce. The portion size was huge and dwarfs any I've seen elsewhere.  A favorite was the House Style Chicken with Fresh Basil ($6.50). This dish was made from pieces of bone-in chicken, then covered with fresh basil. It was plate licking good.  Pork Belly with Sour Vegetable ($6.50) sounded good, but the sourness of the vegetables was off-putting. Perhaps it's an acquired taste?  The boiled Hi-Nan Chicken Rice ($5.95) was tender, and when dipped into the garlic and ginger sauce it was out of this world.  Another textural delight was Stir-Fried Rice Cake with Salted Vegetables ($5.95). Each bite of rice cake resembled a large piece of rice and, while subtle in flavor, had an addictive chewiness.  There are so many dishes to try that it will take a few visits to get through the menu, but with prices this low and service this friendly, it's worth a few trips.

"Home of the Greatest Carne Asada in the Valley" is a pretty bold statement for a restaurant to make in a city where there is a taco shop on just about every street corner.  For me, good carne asada is all about the quality of the meat, marinade and cooking method. These are the qualities that separate America's Taco Shop's carne from others around the Valley.  Located in a charming little old house along Seventh Street, you'll find that this place is just cute as a button. In front, there is a patio and covered bar stool seating on the porch. There is parking out back as well as along Monte Vista to the north. But don't park in Coronado Caf√©'s parking lot they'll have you towed.  Inside are hardwood floors and an old fireplace. There's definitely a homegrown feeling here, like some of the other homes turned restaurants. It's so Phoenix.  Ordering is all about counter service, so you place your order, they hand you a number card and you find a seat.  Carne asada is the name of the game here, and while the beef-centric menu has only a handful of items, there are a few vegetarian options. Some of these include a Bean and Cheese Burrito in two sizes ($3.25/$5.75), America's Corn ($2.50) and a Vegetarian Quesadilla ($3.25). When available, America's Corn is a cob of sweet white corn, slathered with mayo, then sprinkled with cotija cheese, chili and lime. What a great way to get your whole grain and fiber.  On Friday and Saturday, America's Taco Shop features Ceviche ($5.95), but unfortunately it was marred by a strong shrimp flavor. Chips and salsa ($1.50) were good, with a nice balance of salty crunchiness and a little kick with the house-made salsa.  Now for those of us who love the meat, we're hoping for the "Greatest Carne Asada in the Valley." With such high expectations, does America's Taco Shop statement hold true?  In all of its beefy glory, America's carne asada is set apart by using high quality well-trimmed meat. I tried each conception on the menu, twice, and not once did I bite into any gristle or fat. I got mouthfuls of tender, flavorful chopped beef.  The Torta ($5.95) was expertly prepared, taking toasted bread and covering with mayo, guacamole, jalape√±o, lettuce, tomato and heaps of meat. Another variation is called the Vampiro ($3.25), a crunchy grilled corn tortilla with melted jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce and caramelized onions. In reverse is the Taco de Carne Asada ($2.25), with less cheese and served on a fresh corn tortilla. Both hit the mark with plenty of tasty meat.  The Carne Asada Burrito ($5.45/$$7.95) is simple, yet amazingly fantastic. A flaky grilled flour tortilla is filled with like the others chopped beef, guacamole, pico de gallo and caramelized onions. It's that perfect mix of fresh chewy flour tortilla and tender meat that makes this one of the best carne asada burritos I've had in a long time.

As far as I'm concerned this is the best corporate sandwich shop. If you've never been, when you order a sub they literally slice the meat in front you.. its more like a deli experience than a pre-weighed, pre-measured corporate chain. Their white bread is so soft and squishy and does a wonderful job of absorbing mayo, oil, vinegar.. this to me is what a sub should taste like.   Also, they are doing the $5 dollar sub deal here, any cold sub 5 bucks!!!

Hitting Mekong last night to try all the new restaurants we started here because they have Mi Bo Kho (beef stew with egg noodles), one of my favorites. So we ordered that as well as the egg rolls.. we almost started laughing when the egg rolls come out.. they were served with 2 pathetic pieces of warm iceberg lettuce and no herbs.. wtf?! While the rolls and the fish sauce tasted good they were greasy and without the romaine and herbs, ordinary.    The Mi Bo Kho arrived.. I was surprised to see about a half inch of oil on the top of the stew, I like some oil content but this was ridiculous! The stew tasted like it was made from a base and not from scratch.. had this weird fake beef taste. The meat was so fatty and not very well cooked. The meat was so stringy that it got caught between my teeth.   We finished sharing the dishes.. what a complete disappointment.. don't worry Da Vang, they have nothing on you!

I second Helen Y.!! This is certainly one of the finest farmers markets in the valley! So many cool things my hands were full of bags! So much to chose from! Even found brussel sprouts still on the stalk! It doesn't get much fresher then that!   Rancho Pinot was there serving focaccia sandwiches made the braised greens, whole grain mustard and Schreiner's Fine Sausage, amazingly good!   Oh gawd, there was the little old lady selling pickles and preserves, ForgetMeNot Catering.. I ended up buying her pickles and a jar of Strawberry Rhubarb preserves, out of this world tasty! Slather some on a slice of bread from Phoenician Bakery.. it rivals good sex!   When you get a chance, check it out.. its not close to being anything like what you would find in San Francisco but for Phoenix/Scottsdale, its perfectly awesome!

When they say neighborhood, they aren't kidding, literally in the Coronado residential neighborhood at 12th street and Oak, the restaurant lives in an old building that once housed the Arizona Showmen's Association. The rehab has been lovingly restored by its owner DJ Fernandes who is also not by coincidence an architect. When pulling up you can see such attention to detail and design from the concrete stamped handicapped spot, to the interesting lights and exterior brushed stainless door pulls. When entering the building be sure to check out the signage made up of letter building blocks, clever and grounding. Rehabilitation like this helps make the Phoenix area so interesting and original.   The inventive menu was designed by DJ, his girlfriend Jessica Ruiz and chef/consultant Mitch Hoverman, who interestingly also opened Palette. The idea is to share plates amongst a group of friends, though you can easily put together a traditional 3 course meal if that is what suits you best. We opted to share our plates so we could try as many as possible. To best describe the menu it would be eclectic, with Creole, French and Spanish twists. There are 3 sections to chose from, Start, Smaller Plates and For Sharing, the menu is accessible and interesting.  Starting things out, while the grilled baguette ($5) might sound ordinary, its crispy and light goodness comes from Simply Bread. Accompanied is a whole head of roasted garlic and finished with Bariani olive oil. The Bariani is essentially liquid gold with its grassy mild and pure unfiltered flavor. If there is any left in the bowl when you're done don't let the waiter take it away, it's to precious to be wasted and will taste great on just about anything. Together with the nosh plate ($7) it's all about simple clean flavors. Salted melon, Molinari &amp; Sons salami, manchego cheese and toasted pistachio's were so delicious it was hard to share though there was plenty for all. Panko walnut-crusted fontina ($6) was perfectly crunchy and with each bite the melted strands of the fontina cheese were delightful and satisfying. Patatas bravas ($5) are classic tapas however the Tuck version turns potato cubes into long thick planks served along side of 2 dipping sauces. The planks were lightly crispy and well seasoned, though dipped into the aioli and the spicy tomato sauce together was good, love came from dipping into the remaining Bariani olive oil.  Working into the Smaller Plates menu, the panini bites with prosciutto ($9) were so good we were squabbling over the last piece. A nice slab of ciabtta bread stuffed with grilled pear, taleggio cheese, arugala and honey was a sweet and savory combo that has to be tasted and savored. Order 2, one for the table and another wrapped up to go for lunch the next day. Another contrasting sweet and savory small plate would be the medjool dates stuffed with chorizo and topped with melted gruyere ($9). I've had many of stuffed dates, but never like this, spicy and sweet, chewy and meaty, very nice! The mac and cheese with crispy prosciutto, topped with breadcrumbs and lobster ($12) was sublimely creamy and tender, like a really good hug where you just melt into his arms, bury your face into his chest while you're enveloped in comfort and security. Who knew mac and cheese could make you feel so good?!  Turning our attentions to the citrus-brined fried chicken ($17) was a sight to behold. 3 large, generously battered pieces of deep fried passion caused instant salivation. I have to say that this was the juiciest tenderest fried chicken I've ever had the pleasure of sinking into. The crunchy coating, the moist flavorful chicken and the slight citrus after taste were absolute perfection. Along side was a large white cheddar waffle, slathered in maple butter and a bowl of pork laden collard greens. The waffle had a light, fluffy and almost mashed potato consistency that was fork tender and soaked up the chicken juices easily. The collards were nice and porky with that slight bitterness only tempered by salt and sugar.  This plate was simply amazing!  For the beef eaters there is a spiced skirt steak ($18) served with parmesan lentil mashed yukons and mushrooms, that was so hearty and delicious, I can't imagine having this anywhere else.  There is usually only one way to finish a good meal like this and that's with my favorite self proclaimed food group, chocolate. We all tore into the chocolate brownie and almond cream ($7) with a vengeance. You could tell with each bite that this was no box mix, crackly shininess on top, moist and crumbly, this was a great brownie. If this is too much you will also a receive a 1 bite postre with your check. On this night it was raw chocolate chip cookie dough with a slathering of melted dark chocolate, happy ending!  The stars are aligned for the Tuck Shop. With all of their elements in near perfect cohesion, this will soon be one of the coolest and freshest places to eat, drink, and of course share.

Ate at Blanco last night.. very corporate and super accommodating.. we had a wonderful time which even surprised me.. stuck to the basics and thought it was the best of the Fox restaurants. Seeing that we've never had a good experience until last night says a lot. Was kind of cool seeing Sam Fox there actually quality controlling everything that was coming out of the kitchen.. though you know he was just annoying everyone, LOL!  Had the short rib cheese crisp and you know what, it was actually crispy and good. Then tried the queso fundido con chorizo.. pretty darn tasty.. the cheese was slightly burnt on the bottom which I just love, wrapped in a warm flour tortilla, oh yeah!   For dinner I ordered the machaca burrito.. is there such a thing as to much meat? I swear it was a whole beef roast wrapped in a tortilla.. the Mr had the green pork enchiladas.. I though those were very tasty but the sides were even tastier.. their rice is like risotto, very creamy! Helen Y was with us and she ordered the shrimp and crab civiche which I thought was extremely tasty though I would have loved it even more if it were on a toasted baguette! More like a shrimp and crab salad than a civiche though that's just me..   We ended with the tres leches cake.. this was a pretty dismal attempt at tres leches.. was so dense, chewy and sickening sweet. It was so sweet in fact it burnt my throat, pretty gross!  What a great time! Blanco certainly has a fun open atmosphere and a fabulous patio with VERY comfortable seating out there.. you can order dinner up there instead of eating in the dining room which is very cool! Also, the staff was friendly and VERY attractive.. I think for me, this is the best of what Fox Concepts has to offer so far. Definite mass appeal.

I think its going to take some time for this place to really come about. While the space is nice the food was kind of mediocre.   Started with the Sea Bream Ceviche.. all I could taste was vinegar and citrus, no fish flavor came though.. had the lamb trio for dinner.. the sausage was raw in the middle, was a super mega turn off! They were quick to replace the sausage but the damage was done.. the chop was alright but could get that anywhere.. the shank was completely flavorless.. now at these prices I was expecting a whole lot more in terms of flavor and execution. Also tried the Fideua' which was salty drippy and fishy, not good at all.   There were a few bright spots.. the service was good as well as both the burrata appetizer and the grilled rib eye.. the steak was one of the tastiest Ive had in quite some time. The churros were pretty good too though these bright spots are not enough to come back. Now M Bar Id go back to.. they have loads of different tapas and are really well priced!  Gawd, what a let down!

Hands down this is the worse little piece of shit Best Buy of all time.. its like the Circle K of electronics stores.. super tiny and compact and not one, seriously, not one employee said hi to us.   The one star is simply for the new electronic smell the store has. Otherwise, I miss the Indian Bend store already. Fuck this anorexic location!

Having gone to the 16th Street location a few times figured it was time to hit Mesa and try the one closest to us. Okay, so you drive through the ghetto, then you hit a nice part by the art center and then ghetto again.. this is definitely a great way to see the cultural diversity of Mesa. Be on the lookout for an old Long John Silvers building and you've found Tortas El G√ºero..   Me and the Mr chowed fiercely! Torta Alambre.. steak and bacon sizzled with peppers, onions and cheese all on a toasted roll.. outfuckingstanding! Dowse this big'un in the avocado salsa and  your tummy will be warm and toasty for hours! The quesadilla version, just as awesome! Pastor was amazingly tender and almost as huge as the Alambre! This one dip into the chipotle cream for some spicy creamy goodness!   Tortas are 4.99-6.60 and they are HUGE, one will do you.. me and the Mr just over order and over eat when we go out.. that's probably why were so fat, and so happy!

Havent been to a Brazilian-style steakhouse since in Puerto Vallarte this past summer. While the meat was better in PV the salad bar at Fogo is a low carbin' dream! We're talking fresh mozzarella, mushrooms, Parmigiano-Reggiano (a whole wheel), manchego cheese, prosciutto.. delicious and satisfying all this and more for only 19.50! Now if you want to have endless rounds with the Gaucho's you'll have to pony up $42.50 (including unlimited salad bar), a real bargain if you ask me, great quality. The meat just keeps coming and coming.. highlights were the leg of lamb, garlic beef and the sausage. They also bring a basket of bread (they forgot ours) as well as fried bananas, mashed potatoes and fried polenta.. be sure to skip that stuff and stick to the meats and salad bar.   Oh, avoid the pork ribs.. while the Mr liked his, mine tasted like they were in someones ass for a while.. pretty nast though I think was the bones.   Now if the only the Gaucho's were shirtless or wearing ass less chaps.. well one would hope.

No this is not a lesbian bar or a strip club.. just a gay bar.. no attitudes and a very comfortable space to hang out in! Plus they have Blue Moon on tap which is fantastic!!   Me and the Mr rarely go to the bars because they can be so cruisy, not this place. Just a local drinking spot for gay men, oh yes, and there are loads of bears too!

Instead of writing a review I'm going to write a warning. Avoid this place at all costs. If you want a lesson on how to run a successful Mexican restaurant do not come here. From the kid at the hostess stand to the sub par food this was truly a horrible experience.  Of course you start with complimentary chips and salsa. Chips were room temp and not a single grain of salt. Both salsas, one mild chunky and another hot and smooth were both lacking salt, garlic and heat, essentially tomato sauce with some red pepper flakes added for good measure.  We ordered a quesadilla with green chile ($6.00) and what they call a Hal's Sampler For Two ($15.95) which is a sampling of all their house specials. Pollo Fundido, mini chimi's, flauta's, tostada's and a green corn tamale served with rice and beans. Sounds promising and a no brainer.  As soon as the quesadilla arrived we knew what we were in for. The green chile's were of the canned variety and from the first bite, of the old variety. While the cheese was melted the quesadilla was just above room temp and the tortilla was more dried out then actually crisped on a flat top grill. Each bite being worse then the last as the barely melted cheese coagulated around the wet mushy diced chile's. No amount of salsa could save this one, it was d.o.a..  Then the sampler arrived, if there were any high hopes of melty cheeses and tastes of thick guacamole they were squashed just as soon as the plate arrived. The plate of beige, had cheeses but were barley melted and like the quesadilla, everything was just above room temperature. Let me tell you, there was nothing redeeming or delicious on this plate. Just a sampler of dried out, deep fried food covered in cheese and some hyper green, bland version of guacamole.  After a few bites of this and that we asked for the check and made our way for the door. When I asked our server for a to go menu, she seemed genuinely shocked that I may have thought that the food was good enough to order again. I only needed it to make sure I got the information correct when writing this review. The owner's should be ashamed of themselves. In a market where there is decent Mexican food abound this kind of crap just doesn't fly.

I have to say that I'm am so disappointed with Posh at this time. The food just failed to wow, that and with an excruciatingly long 2 and a half hour 5 course meal was painful, figuratively and physically (the seats were so hard).   The idea here to to select what type of eater you are, vegetarian, carnivore, seafood or chefs choice.. then you outline the things you don't like as well as dietary restrictions. Great concept, even now I still think its a great concept but I don't think many people are going to get it, or are that adventurous. I think Posh would have done well in a foodie city like San Francisco but I don't think its going to take off here.   The chef does select great ingredients and seems to be very confident in his knowledge of cooking, plus he's very creative. 2 of us were low carbing of the 4 in our party but, none of the dishes were much different between us. For instance they received a portion of kobe beef and we got a lamb chop, we could have just switched plates and it would have been the same effect. Though when I saw sweet potatoes in the plate I knew that Id have to eat around it. While the chef 'sent' his apologies (he should have come personally) and offered another savory course, my rear was hurting so bad I passed on it. Did get a cheese course for dessert which was good but all the fruit around went into the trash, low carb usually means no fruit.   I'm sitting here just really disappointed and well, hungry. If you're really hungry order more than 5 courses, if not, well you'll be looking for something to eat afterward. BTW, the cookie plate in the end was bigger than any course we had though with being on a low carb diet was kind of torture/cruel since I couldn't eat any of them. We did leave hungry.  Here's a list of plates that we had..  Mache salad w/cucumber and blood orange Fennel soup with endive salad Shrimp with curry and salsify puree Sanddab with roast turnip  Lamb chop with turnip and sweet potato Cheese with pickled and fresh fruit

Yogurtology is a great concept.. for $.45 an ounce you fill your own extra large cup full of frozen yogurt with flavors ranging from tart to cookies and cream, perhaps 10 flavors available at any given time. After you fill your yogurt then you are in complete control of your toppings, fruit, cereal, cookies, even baklava.. so you have to be careful because this will add up really fast.. what you might consider a small is misleading due to the fact that they only have one extra large cup size.. so even the larger portion still looks small in the huge cup.  After hearing so much about this place we all decided to go ahead and give it a try. Me being on a low carb diet figured that they wouldn't have anything to offer. So was I surprised to see that they have a sugar free tart frozen yogurt. So I filled my cup with the SF tart, strawberries and blueberries. Ended up with an 11oz cup, ooops, had no idea! First bite, very very good! A mellow tartness followed by only a slight chemical after taste. However, within 20 minutes of finishing the cup I was having stomach cramps, within an hour I was clinging onto the hope of my underwear staying clean. Thank goodness I made it home!   So this place went from a 4 star to a 2 star.. for sugar free it still tasted decent enough though whatever they use to sweeten it, beware, can cause stomach irritation.

Over the river and through the woods.. lalalala, la, la.. Cave Creek, AZ is kind of a drive but I suppose no worse than driving to Gilbert from Scottsdale. Though this journey includes cactus, multi-million dollar mansions and the occasional coyote rather than tract homes and freeway. Once you get out there the entire area is sort of like old cowboy rustic charm. So doesn't it makes sense to open a BBQ joint way out in the middle of somewhere? The owners of Bryan's sure did!  Only being open just over a month, Bryan's was hopping busy and there is a reason why.. the smell. You can just about taste the pecan smoke as you pass by or pull up. Its an enticing fragrance that grips, strokes and pulls you in to see what's about that hopefully delicious smokey goodness.   Once inside you'll easily tell where you need to go.. it's all about counter service here. The menu is easy to navigate as its short and sweet. Its a greatest hits of BBQ and you'll be hard pressed just to order one thing. Go ahead, order as much as you like, loosen your pants and stay a while.   Ordering for us was pretty easy though we did cross section the menu, pork ribs, pulled pork sandwich, beef brisket, olive cole slaw, baked potato salad and cowboy beans. Get your drinks then grab a seat in the modern, cowboy space. They do serve beer as well as Coke products though I noticed something strange, most people were drinking water. Is that how they are dealing with the economy? Spend a little on food and cut a couple of bucks on the beverages? Good idea I suppose, coke is coke is coke, right? Water cleanses the palette and pairs with anything, sure Ill go with it!   Okay, they called the Mr.'s name, my mouth is watering, my sauces are ready, good to go! First bite, the brisket, smokey, juicy and perfectly tender, the white bread under the brisket soaks up the meat juices, good idea, why didn't I think of that?! Next, ribs, oh no.. I can suck the meat right off the bone? Its not like I can suck a golf ball through a garden hose (well, Ive never tried)  it's just that the ribs are that tender! Dip in a bit of the spicy sauce, hellish good (I don't think they serve BBQ in heaven right? Smoke and flame thing, eh?)! Pulled pork sandwich, is melt on your tongue tender, I can see why so many older folks were ordering these sammies, no teeth required.   Oddly the sides are in need of some tweaking. The baked potato salad was on the dry side but I have yet to have a baked potato salad that I like. Something about cold baked potatoes that don't do it for me. The cowboy beans had no real character and were only one flavor, a smokey sweetness that was good on the first bite but lacked depth. The olive cole slaw was different and while the Mr loved it, I'm just not a fan. However each plate was served with a bread and butter jalapeno, not only clever but addictivly delicious.   Oh the desserts, simple and satisfying. Homemade Ice Cream Sandwich and a Sarsaparilla Float. We got the ice cream sammie which was 2 huge chocolate chip cookies with vanilla ice cream. Nice crunch factor on the cookie with the cold smoothness of the ice cream, talk about a happy ending.   On the way out the sun was setting the moon was rising and all seemed right in the world. Perhaps for the first time in ages, a calm swept over me and all I could smell was pecan smoke begging me to come back some time soon.    Oh yeah, me and my O-face!

Only opened 3 nights ago, Heirloom seems to be out of the gate running. The Mr and I had a wonderful experience with only a few minor service glitches. Otherwise the food was amazingly delicious and expertly prepared by chef Michael DeMaria of the famed Michael's at the Citadel.. in his return to the kitchen his chefly wizardry was all there.  The menu is simple, laid out in 4 courses with each course being a smaller portion and relative in cost, nothing is over $19 bucks. The idea is to put together 3-4 courses of smaller plates to enjoy many different flavors, textures and preparations.  Let me tell you what, the quality and freshness of the ingredients can be tasted! Starting with the Heirloom Salad with White Balsamic, Baby Spinach and Red Onion Salad ($8) was a real hit, as was as the Roasted Beets &Pecorino Crostini ($8).  Butter Poached Lobster with Garlicky Spinach ($18) was a beautiful thing.. perfectly cooked lobster on top of some of the best seasoned spinach Ive had, perfect. The Short Rib Cannelloni on Caramelized Onion, BlueTalleggio Fondue and Beef Broth looked almost to good to eat but with one bite was quickly devoured.  Each night there is a Chef's Feature with tonight's being Sea Bass ($16) on a bed of Crimini Mushrooms and Spinach. The earthy mushrooms tasted great with the perfectly cooked sea bass, flaky and light, very well paired. For beef lovers there was another well cooked goody, the Prosciutto Wrapped Fillet of Beef with Sliced Garlic and Tiny Beach Mushrooms ($19) is not to be missed. This to me seemed like quite the man plate, steak and mushrooms, woof!  While we did sit for a few minutes with the fish and steak with no utensils, and empty drink glasses a couple of times, this was pretty minor stuff since them only being open a few days. I would guess that on out next visit the service kinks will be worked out. The staff was very friendly and personable including Chef Michael, very warm and sat with us for a few minutes which made us both feel quite giddy, I have such a hard on for chefs, must be the jacket.  Heirloom does except reservations though be sure to call perhaps a day ahead to get in. I called the day of and was told they were no reservations remaining. However I sweet talked us in for a later reservation.  I'm so happy that they opened up.. I really love the concept and in these leaner times you can still have your lobster and eat it to.   Thanks Chef!

My gawd, have I been so blind?! Every morning I have a shot of espresso at home from my Miele (CVA 4070  Coffee System) with beans from Cafe Cortez. Each shot is velvety smooth with hints of smokiness and chocolate. This is probably one of finest shots of espresso just for me, every morning, except for... Friday.  I stay out at my bffs house way out in Surprise once a week to visit her and her bf.  So on my way in to work I sometimes stop by Starbucks for a Friday morning booster. So this morning I ordered a single shot of espresso and nearly choked. Simply horrible, its like a scorched burnt coffee taste that's so bitter while maintaining a weird sourness. My gawd this stuff is pure shit. I cant believe it, after all these years I finally see the light. Starbucks coffee for me is utter crap.   I pitched it in the garbage and have sworn off Starbucks. The single star is for the wonderfully cute and perky "barista"

With so many choices for a good breakfast, it can be kind of hard to stand apart. Bright, urban, funky and cool Scramble is a breath of fresh air to the breakfast scene.  The concept is great -- order and pay at the counter, then you're issued a number, take a seat in the dining space, then relax and wait for the food to arrive. Or choose to sit outdoors on the patio that is also dog-friendly.  Judging by several quotations of egg humor painted along the walls of the restaurant, Scramble doesn't take itself too seriously. But one slogan on the menu hits close to home: "We're local and so are our ingredients." Locally sourced ingredients hits high marks when local businesses need our support.  There are so many tastily described items on the menu that being decisive first thing in the morning is difficult. A case filled with Cinnamon Rolls ($3) may help in the decision-making process. I've met many a cinnamon roll, but I've never encountered one like Scramble's. The addition of lemon juice to the frosting distinguishes what would have already been a deliciously tender and gooey roll. It took everything in my power not to order a six-pack to go ($16).  When I scan a menu I try to find the most unique item. At Scramble, one of those standouts is the Brizza ($8). The unlikely combination of two words -- breakfast and pizza -- make for a creative selection. Smoked Gouda and Cherrywood Bacon atop a tender thin crust are well paired, and there wasn't a bite left on the plate. If the spicy kick of the chorizo with peppers and jalapeno cream cheese version doesn't wake you up, then be sure to add a cup of Bold Bottomless Coffee ($2.25).  French French Toast ($6.50) takes thick slices of French baguette, dipped into vanilla custard then cooked on a griddle. The slabs of baguette were tender and had a certain creaminess that made dunking into the maple syrup a real winner. If you like it savory and sweet, add a side of their Cherrywood Smoked Bacon ($3) to the French French Toast for some fun with your food. Bacon dunked into maple syrup is such a childhood pastime.  Scramble also offers lunch after 11 a.m. with a menu of sandwiches, wraps, soups and salads, but breakfast is served all day. This is great because I could eat one of those cinnamon rolls anytime!

Oh gawd, another shitty Chinese food place in Surprise. This place is actually ran by Chinese people but of course they stick with "Asian" (actually American) favorites. I guess tried and true pays the rent every month but they should know that different pays off, look at Vogue Bistro.  Tried a few lunch specials including Kung Pao Chicken and Ma Po Tofu.. each came with a soggy spring roll as well as white rice. However if you eat in you'll also get a bowl of soup and a salad, we did take out. The Kung Pao was Kung lame with not much flavor or heat. The Ma Po Tofu was bland and didn't have any of the veggies that the menu promised. Even the addition of chile paste could save this one. However the Chicken Egg Rolls are pretty good and managed to stay crispy.   Pei Wei is still the best Surprise has to offer on terms of Asian food, though that isn't saying much at all.

Having driven by this area weekly, I only noticed Damelos Bakery & Pizzeria; maybe it's their bright signage? On my way home I saw the sign, Sacred Hogan, and immediately flipped a bitch. Frybread and I have a deep connection, it used to be the only reason why I would even go to the State Fair, well that and a foot long corn dog, but that's another story.  I was greeted by a very woofy guy, thick goatee, nice calves and belly... Ah yes, frybread. After looking over the menu I ordered the B.R.G., which is a bean, red chile and green chile Navajo taco ($8.79).  Now I didn't see my taco until I got it home since I got it to go... When I opened the box I swear there was a white light emanating from its center, their tacos are HUGE, ENORMOUS, PORTLY, and well, LARGE! I could sense its mightiness when I was handed the box, but I had no idea until I had it fully exposed. My mouth began to water as I opened to take in the hot and thick goodness, my saliva acting as a lubricant to get the whole thing in. Its girth was only trumped by its heft; it took 2 hands just too barely manage it to my face. At the last second I chickened out, what was I doing? What would the Mr. think of me if he saw me like this, face to face with a potential love affair? Cutting it into more manageable pieces was the right thing to do. The meat in the red and green chile was so tender and well seasoned it just melted with each bite.  At the halfway point I figured I would save half for later since it was so large but I couldn't resist its chewy texture and savory allure. Yes *sniff* *sniff*, I ate the whole thing, every last bite including the tender beans that fell out of the sides!!! With no shame and no guilt, I waddled into the bedroom fell onto the bed and took a 2 hour nap. Sometimes life just doesn't get much better than this.   I feel like I need a cigarette.

When in Rome, do as the Romans do, right? Out in Surprise, AZ there aren't to many independents to chose from but just about every chain you can think of. Including a new Barro's at the corner of Greenway and Reems which is just a mile from my bff's house.   They not only have a decent pizza but some of the meatiest wings Ive had in ages! We ordered the daily special which is a 1 topping, XL pizza and 24 wings, bone in or boneless for 23 bucks! We got a pepperoni and 24 honey bbq wings, bone in.. I love a good bone! Anyhoo..  Pizza is ample topped with thin slices of slightly oily pepperoni and has a chewy and slightly crispy crust. The wings are tender and the thick rich honey bbq taste was memorable. For 23 bucks and with the amount of leftovers, probably 2 meals, a real bargain. Plus the quality really seems to be there in both the ingredients and the friendliness of the staff.   I suppose I can consider myself a Roman now, wuff!

Oh F*CK yeah!  Okay so Ive had Indian food before.. generally the stuff you can buy at Trader Joe's or make can make at home. However I have never been to an Indian restaurant before.. Ive always wanted to try but the health reports and the chronic cockroach problems always seemed to keep me and the Mr away.   After seeing a write up on Chow Bella I decided that I'd take the plunge! It was SO worth the chance.. totally clean, super friendly staff, great drinks and delicious food! We ordered heavy to cross section the menu.. not one dish sucked out of the 7 dishes that we ordered. The rice pudding made certain parts of me stand on end.. it was that good!   I'm very much looking forward to coming here again.. if I were into the ladies I would have buried my face right into the belly dancers boobs.. seemed like the thing to do after a couple of the best long island ice teas!!

The heat was intense against the back of my neck. I could feel the sweat running down into the collar of my shirt and racing to the center of my back. As I looked at my friends across the table from me, their eyes were closed in fear of certain blindness, the sun was the enemy. All seemed okay once their sunglasses were positioned and the drinks arrived, though the heat from the north side of the restaurant was still there. Gallons of sangria could only temper the heat yet never conquers; we leave that for the soon coming night.   I know I know, it sounds like a horrible start to a horrible experience, it wasn't really, I swear. Only a quirk in the new breakfast, lunch and dinner eatery located inside of the Clarendon Hotel. To be fair they were pretty busy and there weren't too many seating options available to us at the time, so we took what we were offered. The space is lined both the east and north sides with large windows that allow for great light and heat. So if you're fair skinned like myself or you're Vampire, ask to be sat somewhere away from the windows or you might not have an unpleasant experience. Okay, moving on now.  Like at many Mexican food restaurants you'll be served chips and salsa but GB does it so much better. Not only are the chips thick and crispy but also there are 4 different salsas to dip from including a smooth and creamy green salsa, which was a hit at the table. Be warned though, both red salsas are on the spicy side and while I love spicy be warned. If you'd like to have more fun dipping those deliciously crunchy chips, order the Guacamole ($7). This dip is far chunkier and interesting with nice large cubes of avocado and chili that'll give your chips reason and purpose. The taste is superb and fresh, it should be since each bowl is made when the order is placed, good stuff!  Have you ever heard of Chicharr√≥n? In Latin American Chicharr√≥n has many recipes but in its simplest, it's fried pork skin a.k.a. pork cracklin's or pork rinds. Hope I haven't lost you here because GB does a cool thing with this idea. Instead of fatty pork skin they use cheese and instead of fry they griddle the cheese till it's nice and crunchy then they shape it into a cone while it's still hot. The Chicharr√≥n de Queso ($7) is then served with an aji aioli. What better to have cheese with than mayo, right? The deeply flavored cheese is also great with salsa and the guacamole.   I can honestly say from a foodie perspective, tacos are as perfect as pizza. There's a balance of flavors and textures that really get me growling for more and GB don't disappoint. At $2 each you have a choice of pork, steak, and veggie. All are served on a fresh made corn tortilla and each with their very own adornments.  The fish tacos are made with eco friendly fish, I guess they drive hybrid vehicles, and are market priced. Shaved lettuce, pico de gallo and guacamole shored this tasty taco. The carne asada is made with grilled ribeye and has a covering of charred tomato salsa. Since these are only $2 each, why not try them all?  All the taco flavors can be also ordered as a torta for $7. Hot grilled telera bread piled high with tender ribeye and avocado was a sheer pleasure to eat. Well balanced bread to meat ratio and with just enough toppings to make the sandwich hold together perfectly. The tortas are ala carte so you might want to go ahead and order a side of French Fries ($2), which are house cut and well seasoned and are a wonderful compliment.  Of course they have one American favorite and they do it really well and that's the Cheeseburger ($7). This is after all a breakfast, lunch and dinner hotel restaurant so I think it's a given to have this on this menu. Perfectly cooked in all its great beefiness, this is an outstanding cheeseburger and even comes with French fries.   GB can't all be spicy and savory; they also make some wonderful desserts that are worth saving room for. Take the tender Crepas con Cajeta ($4) which takes crepes, sliced bananas and peanuts then stacks them up for a nice sharable dessert. Though the peanuts were a bit chewy, I think crunchy peanuts would have made a better contrast, it's a personal taste though. My to die for favorite was the Postre de Chocolate ($5) which is a glass filled with creamy smooth house made chocolate pudding, then tops it with graham cracker pieces and marshmallow fluff. Seriously fantastic, all you need is a campfire, oh wait, the heat on the back of my neck will do.  Gallo Blanco is working on the sun issue and will soon have shades as well as an outdoor patio. A new place is always a work in progress and Gallo Blanco is certainly worth using a little bit of sunscreen in the meantime.

3 way burrito ($3.25).. not only is the name a whole lot of fun but it tastes awesome! Red chile, green chile and beans wrapped in one of their killer tortillas.. smooth, tender, creamy and delicious. Make it a foot long ($.90)and now were talking! Pair it up with their salsa and you're in for some great Mexican goodness!  I mentioned the tortillas but I REALLY need to mention them again, they are fucking kick ass! Stretchy while tender with a slightly smokey char taste, this is about as perfect as a tortilla can get. Because they were so messed up with our order the manager gave us a free dozen.. they were just made too, hot and steamy in the plastic bag. I couldn't wait and ate one immediately.. my gawd, great Mexican experience.   I love you Carolina, will you marry me?

First impression, this place rocks!! It's in the space that used to house Palette.. the space has a very "breezy" sort of Caribbean plantation feel that's easy to relax right into.. not to mention the moment you walk through the gate you're greeted by friendly smiling faces.   LB has a massive outdoor patio complete with tables, well appointed outdoor sofas and chairs where you can leisurely sip a cocktail or beer. While their grand opening isn't truly until Tuesday (12th of May) they seem to be ironing out their kinks pretty quickly with only a few minor hiccups mostly due to computer errors rather than human.   The menu is made up mostly of burgers, salads, lahvosh pizzas and a few entrees. We ordered a few starters, the LB Favorite (bacon and roasted corn lahvosh pizza, half $9) as well as the Queen Creek Olive Oil (kalamata, tomato, fresh basil and feta lahvosh, half $9). You know you can put bacon on just about anything and have it taste awesome but paired with the right flavors the good becomes great! The sweetness of the roasted corn with the savory saltiness of the bacon sent me into piggy heaven! Was so good I didn't want to share but alas, I'm a good guy like that. The Queen Creek Olive Oil lahvosh was very tasty, the lahvosh being crispy and light but sturdy enough to hold the ample toppings. I love olives and olive oil paired with cheese and the feta was a great idea. The cheese being strong enough to stand up to the kalamata, the tastes were right on.  Meanwhile we were all sipping on Nimbus Brown Ale ($4) which was ice cold, rich and complex. Nimbus is certainly one of my favorite craft beers and at 4 bucks, nice! LB also has a full bar and while cocktails around 8 bucks they pours are generous. We didn't have wine service but the manager Eric used to be the sommelier at The Grill at TPC back in the day when it was one of the best steak houses in town. He knows his wine so I look forward to next time when I can enjoy a glass or 6.   I ordered the Fire Island ($10) which is one of several classic Pischke dishes on the menu that made it over from the old days. Oh yes, the owner Sid Campbell was a cook at Pischke's Paradise for over 12 years before it was ruined by new owners. The Fire Island is a pizza with chicken breast, red onion, green chilies and a cream cheese sauce that is absolutely finger licking tasty! Be sure to ask them to add 2 over easy eggs on the top, outrageous!   The Mr ordered the Roasted Green Chile Cheeseburger ($10) which is served on MJ's Breads giant English muffin. The beefy flavor combined with the soft texture of the English muffin was excellent, you can taste the quality and the smokiness of the green chile. An order of house fries comes with the burgers and sandwiches and let me just say, they were seasoned so well that you could have chowed them down plain. However, the bread and butter pickle ketchup is simply amazing with its dice of bread and butter pickles, never knew ketchup could be elevated to another experience!   First impressions last nearly forever and this one was great! I think LB has a bright future in front of them. This will be a great place to hang out on the patio after work with friends, drinks and cool conversation. Excellent addition to the neighborhood.

In this day and age of many pizza concepts around the valley sometimes it's tough to figure out which one you actually want to visit. For me it really has to be a complete package for me to sit down and spend my hard earned money. In my years of package peeking I think I've become quite the expert and can quickly sum up if it's worth exploring or not.  One part of this package is coifed, bobbed, styled and blown; Salon de Venus was making women beautiful for 58 years in the same location on Camelback and 19th Street.  The star shaped bricks along Camelback are unmistakably Phoenix and remind me of being a wee package peeker growing up in the valley. The new owners Dan and son Aric Mei deserve so much credit for preserving the wall and repurposing many of the items used in the old salon space. Every time we turn around there is something being ripped and bulldozed over to make way for the new with no respect to the old, hats off to them for their thoughtful redesign. What has been done to the new space is simply amazing. The sheer volume and proportion of the main dining room while open, has a sense of coziness and interest with the use of wood and other recycled materials. You can tell that the building is special and well thought out with so many details you can discover something different on each visit.   Since the space is so well designed and inspired, what about the menu? Created by two local chefs, Jared Porter and Jerry Alday, the duo has seemed to have created a delectable menu based on their own experiences using fresh local and seasonal ingredients. There is definitely a sense of this commitment walking up the path to the entrance. They have many of their own herbs, vegetables and citrus growing right there in planter boxes. I even noticed several eggplants growing which I hope to be lucky enough to try on an upcoming visit. While the menu is pizza centric, there is also a varietal of sandwiches, salads and pasta. For the kid-set there is a section just for the younglings to choose from. Aside from Mac and Cheese, this part also includes a B.L.T. for the more sophisticated baby-foodie, how cool is that?  Looking at a great package I like to allow myself to enjoy other more subtle parts of the package, in this case the balls. Arancini ($8) which are big and satisfying balls of creamy risotto, deep fried then served on a bed of pomodoro sauce. These are some of the tastiest balls I've had in ages and are a must when ordering. Having a similar impact is the Cauliflower Gratinata ($7) that uses cauliflower mixed with aged white cheddar cheese and topped with breadcrumbs then roasted. Basically a cauliflower au gratin, it's a delight to scrape some of the baked cheese off the side of the dish and spread onto a slice of grilled bread. For something a little bit different, the Eggplant Cannelloni ($8) uses slices of tender eggplant in place of pasta. The slices are still stuffed with cheese and served on top of Parlors wonderful pomodoro sauce sans the heaviness usually associated with pasta dishes.   On the lighter side, salads are done very well and almost all come in 2 sizes depending on your appetite. On one visit Parlor was actually offering a salad special that was composed of shaved cabbage, Queen Creek Olives, sliced cucumber, cherry tomatoes and cubes of fresh avocado with a refreshingly addictive oregano vinaigrette ($9.50). In a similar preparation, the on menu Parlor Insalata ($6.50) showcases some of the freshest veggies with the addition of crispy chickpeas and salami which both add a heartier dimension to this robust salad.   While the heat coming from the wood-burning oven couldn't be felt, you can imagine the waves of sultry wind as your face closes in on the best part of the package.  Coming in at 8" and 12" sizes, you can have it a few different ways, your way or the chef's way. Though why limit yourself to just 8" when you can have 12", right? The 12" is plenty to share between 2 diners with decent appetites since the crust is light and thin. The wood burning oven and the chefs do a great job of combining the perfect yin and yang of slight char and crispy golden perfection, Parlor has some seriously great crust! Yukon Gold Potato ($10/$14) is so simply built its near perfect. Roasted potato, gorgonzola cheese, leeks and pancetta has that sort of down home accessibility you might actually finish a whole one by yourself.   Desserts are treated with much thought here but are kept simple and satisfying. Seasonal Fruit Skillet ($7.50) was much like a fruit crisp that mom would make. Made with the tastiest fruit then topped with a layer of pastry and baked until just right, was only made better with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Taking my time with each bite, savoring the quality and preparation, it's the smaller moments in life that can be so memorable. So when you get a chance go ahead, take a peek at that package, you'll never know what you might find unless you look.

It's finally here.. after waiting for so long!!!  I LOVE frozen yogurt.. not that stuff from the 80's but the new wave of tart frozen yogurt, you know the kind.. the stuff with live active cultures, fun toppings and textures set into a cool hip space. There are many knock offs around the valley and the country but this is the original tart frozen yogurt shop.. it's creamy, smooth and delicious! It's only slightly tart and is so creamy you'd think you were eating its high fat cousin.   Ordered a large original with mochi, Fruity Pebbles and banana.. the experience for me is simply sublime.. all the textures and flavors working together in perfect harmony. I never knew it until now but I think Im in love with Red Mango, nothing like having the real thing.  XOXO

Bitzee Mama's isn't my mama! My mama wouldn't have kept her hungry son waiting forever for his lunch. She wouldn't have let my go thirsty with no refills. She does make a good bowl of salsa so that makes it alright, right?   Took my real mama there for lunch.. I ordered the taco salad and ma ordered the cheese enchilada plate.. also a bowl or red chile. Taco salad was alright except the taco shell was so mushy from water it literally fell apart when I picked it up.. glad I wasn't eating the shell. She's old school.. makes a darn good cheese enchilada and refried beans. Struck out again with the red chile.. I swear, can no one except La Canasta make red chile? While the meat was tender and the sauce was smooth it had a weird orange color to it and the meat tasted, well wasn't any beef Ive ever had.   On the way to the counter to pay my bill I noticed that almost everyone was eating chimichanga's.. well then, looks like I ordered the wrong thing! Place is also uber cheap.   Be careful what you order and mama will be just fine.

Thanks for the reco Joel, you rock!! Would also like to thank the the owners of Tortas El Guerro for opening a location closer to me than 16th street!! Woohoo!!  I have a long standing relationship with Tortas El Guerro. They make some of the best tortas in town at some of the best prices. You know you've hit the gold mine when you're the only white boy in the place!! Starting out at 16th Street then branching out, Ive managed to visit all their locations. So when I saw that Joel posted this I nearly wet myself!    Ordered the Cubana, ($6.50) which had ham, cheese, pork leg and beef milanesa! This was a hefty man size sandwich that's a pretty tall order to shove into your mouth. Fortunately I have an unhinging jaw (well not really but sounds kind of cool like a snake or something) so I was able to eat it sort of neatly, I actually pressed it down a little, lol. The flavors were fresh and well seasoned. A topping of their avocado salsa really hit the spot but be warned, it truly is spicy. In fact I wasn't  expecting it, actually brought a tear to my eye, very nice!  Also order a Alebre Quesadilla ($5.99) which was stuffed full of steak, onions, peppers, bacon and cheese. Each stringy cheesy melty bite was sheer gluttony after having the Cubana. Next time, Ill only order one or the other. Egads!  I really liked the space. While it was clearly the shell of a Wendy's I liked that they added some rustic plank flooring and tight subtle lighting. Very comfortable, friendly and super clean!    Looking forward to visiting again soon, love this place!  P.S. they have a drive thru!

P.S. they have a drive thru! Though this is how it works, you call ahead, place your order with one of the really nice folks from there and then pick it up via the drive thru. Now that's about as awesome as the Cuba√±a!

Finally after watching for months the old Fry's is now El Rancho Market and it's finally open! The grand opening was huge! This place was monster packed, all lines were over 10 people deep. They had order takers at the fresh food counter because behind the counter, they were just buried. Debit/Credit card machines were down while the band outside played loudly. People were dancing in the parking lot which was nearly impossible to navigate! Crazy crazy!   The red and green chile looked amazingly irresistible but alas I was unable to sample any, was just to crowed! Though tomorrow is a new day, or is today a new day? Anyway, going back for a more in depth taste, oh, and some of those awesome looking in-store made tortillas!!

I've become a huge fan of Twitter, the Web site that gives you the ability to share thoughts with followers. It's a way for people like me -- who are into cooking, dining and eating -- to find thousands of like-minded individuals. I follow local food peeps and, on occasion, we'll all meet for some eats.  Recently a small mob of us arrived hungry and thirsty at El Coquito, a family run Puerto Rican restaurant in Scottsdale.  El Coquito shares its name with a rum-infused coconut milk beverage. Ironically, El Coquito does not have a liquor license, although BYOB is allowed for a small fee. Fortunately, one of us was prepared and brought a couple of bottles, selections that went well with the creamy and delicious Coquito ($2.75).  Appetizers here are a celebration of the deep fryer - every crunchy selection is fried.  Similar to bananas, plantains are to Puerto Ricans as potatoes are to Americans. Mashed, grated and sliced, there are 101 ways to cook a plantain. Maduros ($3.99) are sliced, then deep fried, making a sort of a thick chip. Another variation, Ara√±itas ($3.99), uses shredded plantain to make golden nests with a side of ketchup and mayo sauce for dipping.  Relleno de Papas ($3.99) are baseball-sized mashed potato balls filled with seasoned ground beef, then deep fried. Made from salted cod, Bacalaitos ($3.99) are fritters fried crisp on the outside, yet chewy on the inside. A squeeze of lemon and a dash of hot sauce made these even better.  My favorites were the flaky Pastelillo ($3.99). Just like an empanada or turnover, these deep fried pastries are filled with meat or cheese.  With so much munching and crunching, I didn't fully realize how full I was becoming until the entree arrived.  Mofongo ($7.99) is pretty typical Puerto Rican fare, and for good reason -- it's tasty. Using mashed fried plantains with hints of garlic and bacon topped with your choice of meat, what's not to like. I chose mine to be covered in the most lusciously juicy roast pork, and it was sublime.  The same roasted pork is used in a few other dishes, like the Pernil y Arroz Gandules ($10.99), a plate full of the tender meat with a generous helping of moist fluffy yellow rice. A little more familiar might be the Cuban con Tostones ($7.99), a grilled sandwich composed with pork, ham, cheese and pickles.  If steak is more your style, Bistec Encebollado ($10.99) takes marinated strips of steak and grills them with onions. It's served with your choice of rice and beans.  Desserts ($2.75) sounded great, but we were too full to enjoy the likes of flan and rice pudding. However there was still a sweet ending to the evening, sharing mounds of comforting Puerto Rican plates with my new Twitter foodie pals.

This latest hybrid might sound different but after trying the Filipino-Mexican fusion at Karey's Kitchen, you'll ask yourself why no one had done it sooner?  Situated at the southeast corner behind Blockbuster at 40th Street and Thomas Road, Karey's is in one of those blink-and-miss-it locations.   From the good luck kitty at the register to the rich looking hardwood floors and dark wood furniture, it's actually charming. There are a few tables as well as counter seating for eat in, and the tables can be pushed together to accommodate a party of eight or more.  Karen, once an accountant, has turned restaurateur in this family-run venture, which includes her mom, Puring, husband, Ray, and brother, Michael.  It brings me so much joy to see the love and care that goes into a place that is family owned and independent. The warm smiling faces that greet you at the counter are so genuine and welcoming. Karen and Puring run the front of the store and tail it back to the kitchen to cook.  For the unfamiliar, many Filipino foods consist of stews, braises and roasts of beef, pork and chicken, which work perfectly for this concept. For the purist you can order a combination plate of classic Filipino dishes and select your own items, or you can go for something more unconventional, yet accessible, like many of its tasty hybrid burritos, chimichangas and flautas.  I must add the menu is more of a guideline rather than something set in stone. If there is something on the menu you find yourself craving, maybe call ahead to make sure she has it that day. Sourcing top quality has been tough, and on a several visits the restaurant was out of one thing or another.  Daily specials play a large part of Karey's menu, and there are always three to five specials per day. If you'd like to know about those dishes, you can choose to follow Karey's Kitchen on Twitter.  On one visit I created my own three-item combo ($5.99), which included a couple of out-of-this-world pork spare ribs. The barbecue sauce was house-made and had a wonderful slightly smoky and sweet flavor.  I also chose the chicken curry, which was fall-off, the bone tender and not heavy like most I've tried.  To round off the combo, I chose the pancit, which is the Filipino version of Chinese lo mein. Though rice sticks were used instead of egg noodles, it has a lighter sauce. Of course this was made to order and the vegetables were still slightly crisp.  The pancit is probably the lightest item on the menu and had plenty of chicken breast and vegetables for those who are watching their figures.  Adobo is to the Philippines as Pho is to Vietnam. Essentially a method of stewing meat brought to the Philipines by the Spanish in the 1500s, it has become the national dish.  Karey's version is absolutely delicious with its rich savory flavors and tender meats. You can have this in a combo or rice bowl, but do yourself a favor and get the Pork Adobo Burrito ($5.99). A huge flour tortilla stuffed with pork adobo then rolled in Parmesan cheese. With the outside rolled in cheese, it adds a depth to the burrito that I've never quite experienced.  With the burrito you also have your choice of Spanish rice, white rice, garlic rice or beans. The Spanish and garlic rice are moist and flavorful, but my favorite were the creamy beans. Karey's doesn't have a traditional Mexican salsa but instead chooses to use Asian chili paste. The spicy vinegary heat is the perfect complement to every dish I tried.  I love eggrolls in about any shape and form, including Karey's outstanding Filipino version called Lumpia ($2.95/$4.95). These are smaller than what you'd normally expect at an Asian restaurant, but the crunch factor is far bigger. Simply filled with seasoned ground pork and served with a side of sweet chili sauce, these little bad boys are fantastically crispy and light.  Keeping with the hybrid fusion theme, desserts are few but interesting and worth the calories. The Halo Halo ($4.95) is made of shaved ice, beans, purple yams, sweetened condensed milk and ice cream.  Okay, I know, it sounds a little crazy, and when it is served, the first thing that comes up is, "What have I gotten myself into?"  This dessert is brightly colored and unusual in its presentation with so many different layers. Once you brave the first bite, it won't be your last. Creamy, icy, tender and smooth, it's a textural and flavor overload that should be experienced at least once. I have a feeling I'll be having another one on my next visit.  Ask about Puring's Cassava Cake ($1.29). It's served warm and is made from shredded cassava, coconut milk and sugar.  From the crispy lumpia to the tender, melt-in-your-mouth adobo, Karen and company cooks how they want to eat and treat their customers how they want to be treated, like family.

Back in the day when the tart frozen yogurt craze started with the wildly popular Pinkberry, who knew that would lead to literally hundreds of knock offs. Yes, even Pinkberry is a knock off of the Korean chain Red Mango, which is probably a knock off of another. But it was Pinkberry's simple healthy approach, stylish interiors and lines out the door which drew much attention to itself and its concept. So it was only a matter of time before someone would copy the success, some almost as good and others well, not so much.  Yogurtland is one of those success stories, expanding to nearly 50 locations nationwide in only a few years. While it's not Pinkberry, their claim to fame is to offer more for less. Choose your size of cup then fill it with one of the many varieties of the low calorie, low sugar, non-fat fro-yo. Then pile high the toppings ranging from fresh fruit, breakfast cereal, cookies, syrups and candy, be as stingy are as creative as you like. Once your satisfied with your creation, set it on the scale for your total. Yogurtland charges a mere $.30 an ounce so you can become quite the fro-yo artist with little investment to your imagination.  Once it was my turn to approach the self service machines I was immediately overwhelmed by the choices. Finally I got a hold of myself and made a fro-yo base of Vanilla Wafer Cookies and Cream, New York Cheesecake and Plain Tart. Though the best was yet to come, the topping station! Bananas, vanilla wafers, Fruity Pebbles and chewy rainbow mochi, I was set and at $3.60 I felt like I somehow robbed them.  Being mostly a purist I immediately tapped the Fruity Pebble and banana adorned Plain Tart. For tart yogurt its bite was subtle, each bite was as delightful as the first. The Vanilla Wafer Cookies and Cream had an artificial vanilla taste which wasnt very good. However eating the New York Cheesecake flavor was creamy and well rounded. The addition of the vanilla wafers was a hit and meshed really well with the smooth cheesecake taste.  Yogurtland is pretty hopping most nights, so take a dose of patients and imagine the endless choices that will be bestowed upon you once you reach the front of the line.

Chef Matt Carter, already known for Zinc Bistro and the year-old The Mission restaurant, is getting a lot of buzz for his latest venture, Nine 05.  Named for its location at 905 N. Fourth St., the Asian restaurant occupies the former home of Fate. Carter and his team have completely changed and modernized the venue into an ultra-cool hip modern space.  The outdoor bar is great, and it comes with a weekend night DJ. The dining space outside is fairly large and can accommodate decent sized parties. With the cooler weather coming, this will be a good place to hang out for a drink and a bite.  Service at Nine 05 is what I like to call triple A: amazing, attentive and attractive. During two visits, my party felt so welcomed and taken care of, we almost wanted to take off our shoes and stay longer.  On my second visit, manager Jennifer Mara even remembered my favorite beer from my first visit, Xingu ($5). It's this kind of attention that shows in the service and every aspect of the experience, including the well planned menu.  Plate presentations are some of the prettiest I've seen in quite some time. During both occasions we shared appetizers, then each ordered an entree, which can be shared family style. Portions are generous, and the chef does a fantastic job keeping things from getting too heavy.  The crisp, clean flavors of the Cucumber Salad ($8) was a great way to get things moving. The bright and light Octopus Sashimi ($12) had a wonderful flavor from the pickled chilies, more sweet than spicy, yet balanced, though the octopus was a little on the chewy side.  Fried items were piping hot, starting with the Tomato Katsu ($9), which was lightly breaded and nicely crisp. Beware of that first bite, these were hot, hot, hot! The heirloom tomato was nice and ripe resulting in deeply satisfying flavors.  The Rice Cakes ($7) had a nice crunch, but these were really to show off the tasty cilantro-lime coconut yogurt drizzled onto the plate. If I had a bowl of that yogurt I would have dipped everything into it. Good stuff!  Duck and Foie Dumplings ($11) were good, but I wish the foie flavor would have been more pronounced. It's a personal taste.  The Korean Chicken Wings ($8) were tender, crispy, meaty and interesting with the topping of chili threads. I've actually never had a chili thread before, so small and thin but wow, what a flavor explosion!  Entrees were a blast, beginning with n ample bowl of Red Curry Mussels ($18). These plump bad boys were made for the fragrant coconut and lemongrass curry broth. The chef also piles on thick slices of bread so as not to waste even a single drop of the complex elixir.  Eating the Pork Belly Fried Rice ($13) was a pleasure, savoring each bite of tender hog and sweet spiked caramelized pineapple. I asked for a side of their pickled chilies to add a spicy sweet dimension to the tender rice.  Be sure to use the chilies also on the Tonkotsu Ramen ($15). A huge steaming bowl of richly flavored broth and noodles topped with pork belly, scallions and an egg. You know how I get when there is egg yolk involved, the flavor just drives me wild, while it adds a certain richness to just about any dish.  Desserts ($7 each) are limited to only a few thoughtful selections. The Blueberry Mochi Cake was moist and chewy, adorned with fresh berries and a scoop of lychee sorbet was refreshing. However, I would have preferred a different flavor of sorbet, since I'm one of those few people who think lychee tastes like soap. It's just a preference.  The Coffee and Chocolate Torte was more my style. With its fudge-like texture and smooth and flavorful chai ice cream, it's real winner.  With great attention to detail, delicious food and a superb staff, I think you will find plenty to be happy about after a visit here. On my way out I couldn't help but think of an excuse to come back, then I was told that the lunch menu is outstanding. What a perfect reason.

I LOVE French food.. in fact when we travel abroad, me and the Mr always make a point to visit a Frenchie place in another city. So when I got wind of a new French place right here in our own backyard I was stoked! The best part, its owned by chef James Porter, who did amazing job over at the now closed Tapino, so my excitement turned to elation when our reservation was confirmed!  So now that I'm home from my dinner with the Mr, I guess I'm slightly indifferent. While they had a strong opening night, it wasn't the service or food per-se but more like the other diners.   The dining room is small and extremely intimate with an amazing looking patio, we chose to sit on the inside. The interior is covered in wood, really, the floors, ceiling, walls but nicely contrasted by very stylish crystal chandeliers. I do have to say that I'm sure glad that they chose larger tables for the diners, since you can never have enough space. So there is plenty of room at the table to simply spread out and relax.  Service is pretty shiny and have no complaints, in fact our server was outgoing, attractive and knowledgeable. The bar staff was also very competent since both of our cocktails, Bohemian Sidecar ($9) and the Le Matador de Nimes ($9) were mixed perfectly and tasted great, putting us both into great moods until... a 6 top was sat down right next to us.. I know the old saying, you can't choose your family and in this case, you cant choose your dining neighbors either. They were so loud the Mr and I just looked at each other then decided to check email and stuff on our phones. We couldn't even talk which was a real bummer since this was going to be a romantic evening out. Anyway, the food will make up for it, right?  Of course I have high expectations.. new Foodiebear rule of life, never have expectations of anyone, or anything or you're going to set yourself up for irritation, heartache and misery. With that being said they were out of f*cking Pate! Can you believe that?! Out of the one thing that Ive been looking forward to this entire week. Opening night, first thing on the menu, first table in the place, out of something. I know, I know, things happen but come on, this is opening night!!!! *Sigh* Ended up ordering the Steak Tartar ($8) and the Mr ordered the Foie Gras ($10). Both were excellent both in presentation, quality and taste. While my tartar wasn't pate, it was still excellent with its fried egg on top and crispy potato crisps. The foie was much like the tartar, deliciously perfect and for the price, major value. In fact all of the food that we ordered was really big, surprising for the price points.   Let me tell you what, the Onion Soup ($6) was prefect. In fact Ive never had onion soup that was that good! Perfectly sweet, savory and the right amount of cheese crouton to compliment the soup, not over power it. The Mr liked his Vichyssoise ($6) with it smooth creamy texture and a quenelle of salmon mousse in the center which added a smokey complexity to the soup. Again, the servings were quite large and could have been halved pretty easily.   Entrees were a kind of hit and miss. The Mr had the Steak Frites ($17) which was well cooked but came covered in compound butter thaqt had anchovy in it. First bite I was immediately turned off to the slight fishy undertone. Thank goodness neither of us have fish allergies, very unexpected. The frites were nicely crisp and well seasoned. However the side of sauce for dipping was just strange. Was made from vinegar and had a decent texture but just tasted odd with the fries and the meat all together. Would have preferred something a little more basic, again a preference. I ordered the Porc et Lardon ($16) as my entree and Im pretty happy with the result. Grilled bacon wrapped pork tenderloin with roasted pork gratin which was made with roast pork shoulder, shaved fennel and celery root. The contrast in the flavors and textures was right up my alley aside from the tenderloin being a tad over cooked, it is again opening night.  Desserts were limited to three choices, Chocolate Brulee, Biegnets and Grande Marnier Souffle. We went with the Biegnets de Nutella ($6) and the Souffle ($6). The biegnets had a filling of Nutella which was alright but wasn't a fan until, I took some of the Mr's creme anglaise and dunked them into that. Delish. The souffle was so light and and was just brown enough to caramelize the sugar. You cant go wrong with either dessert.   All in all Petite Maison is an excellent value and with Chef James Porter at the helm expect solid French fare nightly with breakfast and lunch being added soon. Looking forward to back soon but this time Ill go with no expectations.

They tried to make me go to rehab, I said Lo, Lo, Lo..  So it's Friday night, it's getting late, and there's a rumble in your tummy, where to go? Before you'd might hit up some fast food joint and regret it in the morning. Say good bye to those greasy drive-thru burgers and say hello to some down home soul food lovin' at the new location of Lolo's Chicken and Waffles.  Situated at the corner of Scottsdale and Thomas in what used to be a Kyoto Bowl, this is a welcome location to the neighborhood. It's the same delicious menu as the Yuma Street location and for me, just as tasty and deeply satisfying.   Ordering the Lolo's Soul Food Platter ($13) is all about eating way too much way too late but with food this good I wouldn't order anything else. Your choice of fried chicken or fish plus 2 sides and cornbread, can be split between 2 healthy eaters and will be plenty to fill the tummy and the soul. The chosen 3 plump pieces of fried chicken, are so fantastically seasoned, and when smothered in gravy and onions is pretty much addictive pleasure. The sides are fantastically delicious, including the mac & cheese which is so rich and cheesy you'll probably order it every time. The collard greens are wonderfully tender and bursting with bitter sweet goodness.   Dinner here just isn't complete without ordering you a hot buttery waffle ($4) to accompany your fried chicken. The tender sweetness of the waffle works really well with each savory bite of fried chicken, so much so that you might wake up early to come back for breakfast.  Who knew how these 2 components, which sound like such strange bedfellows, would work so well together? It really is a beautiful thing.

I'd love to write about each of what seems to be an onslaught of Thai restaurants opening in the Valley, but many offer the same style of fare. However, a few serve more unique dishes in addition to the classics.  Located on Indian School Road next to 3 Snaps Resale Shop, Thai E-San specializes in the regional cooking of northeastern Thailand, also known as the Issan or Esan region. It is difficult to clearly define Esan cooking since many of those native dishes, like papaya salad and larb, are common on many Thai menus. They are more about heat and sourness, as pretty much everything we tried here reflected that.  I have noticed some commonalities among Thai restaurants, including gracious service. From the time we entered the large dining room until we left, the staff was polite and attentive, not to mention gorgeous. Thai women are stunning.  Another similarity with many Thai restaurants is the sheer size of the menu. I have no idea how they can keep so many ingredients on hand to make so many dishes. If you don't mind some reading and ask lots of questions, you can learn a lot about food, cooking and, of course, eating.  Starting with the Thai E-San Special Appetizer ($12.95) lands you in the middle of a massive amount of shareable treats. Brimming with crunchy Egg Rolls, tender peanut sauce laden Chicken Satay, Wontons and a sweet and spicy Cucumber Salad, there is enough for at least three bear-sized appetites. The portions are large, so sharing is a must, which is also very Esan.  The Beef Salad ($8.95) is sliced char-grilled sirloin with chili, onion, lime juice, rice powder and fresh Thai herbs. It can be ordered with varied heat, from one, which is mild, to five, which is hot as it gets. I prefer ordering two or three, then add heat from the chile condiment jars. This dish was bold, with a nice sourness from the lime juice.  I also was excited about the Thai E-San Sausage ($10.95). It's more of a grilled savory sausage than a fermented sour or sweet sausage, with tubes stuffed with ground pork, pork skin and Thai herbs with a heavy lime flavor. The snappy crunch of each bite led to textures of the pork skin and ground meat, tender with a chewy spring.  I love Drunken Noodles, and Thai E-San's version was top notch. Also called Spicy Noodle with Basil ($8.95), there's a choice of meat or tofu that is stir fried with large wide noodles, chile, basil, bean sprouts, onions and bell peppers. Each tender noodle tastes like it was seasoned on its own with an explosion of flavor and spice.  The massive pile of Pineapple Fried Rice ($12.95) is mixed with shrimp, chicken and juicy pieces of fresh pineapple and topped with cashew nuts. It's a sensual mix of sweet, sour and salty, appealing to most, if not all, of your senses.  Thai E-San offers only a couple of desserts, Coconut Ice Cream ($3.50) and Sticky Rice with Mango ($4.95). The latter offered slices of sweet ripe mango atop hot and sticky rice bathed with warm coconut milk for a great finish.  Thai E-San has almost 100 menu items, so there is plenty to keep me coming back.

I didn't have any choice since it was my sister's birthday.. I would have rather have cooked at home than to have experienced the "OG". However it wasn't as bad as I remember.. though the pasta was over cooked and the sauces lack depth overall the experience wasn't that dreadful. However I was also so happy to see my 2 nephews getting so big and enjoying themselves gorging on hot greasy bread sticks.. it was a family affair.

Simple, satisfying and easy on the wallet, what's not to love about a well-cooked juicy slab of beef between two freshly baked buns? While some burgers are better than others, there usually isn't much to tell them apart.  Now comes Smashburger, the latest and certainly not the last, burger concept that distinguishes itself not by its number of fancy toppings, but by its cooking method.  Smashburger is located in Tempe, next to the ASU campus, where there is more eye candy than free parking. (There is a parking structure nearby with a $3 fee for the first hour.)  Smashburger's name pretty much says it all. The restaurant takes 100 percent ground Angus beef and, using a spatula, literally smashes it onto the cook top. The idea is to quickly sear the meat so that the juices are sealed inside the burger.  I was skeptical of the cooking method since smashing a burger forces juices out during cooking, causing a dry burger. But the staff was all smiles, friendly and showing a genuine eagerness to help.  After only a few bites of my half-pound Classic Smashburger ($5.99), I was convinced that their cooking method is sound -- it makes for a tasty burger. Hanging over the edges of the bun, the meat did remain juicy, with that slightly salty beefiness that I know and love.  If you're really hungry, you can add another half-pound patty for $3. Now that's a burger!  Smashfries ($1.79 when ordered with a sandwich), tossed with olive oil, garlic and rosemary, were an instant hit. The Haystack Onions were limp and too salty.  Chicken sandwiches, salads and hot dogs are also on he menu.  The Arizona Devil Dog ($3.99) is a Hebrew National 100 percent beef hot dog slathered with spicy guacamole, habanero cheese, jalapenos and onions on a toasted poppy-seed bun. Oh, the burn!  To cool things off, Smashburger makes H√§agen-Dazs milkshakes ($3.99) in four flavors -- vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and cactus vanilla (prickly pear). The shakes are rich, creamy and decadent.  Being a fast-casual restaurant, customers order at the counter, then find a seat. In a short while, someone will bring out your grub.  The smallish dining space is modern in an accessible chain store kind of way. Be warned, there are no public restrooms in this store, so be sure to bring your own hand sanitizer.  So, contrary to popular belief, smashing is actually, well, quite smashing.

4 stars means I'm a fan, and yes Id agree with that. However what is putting them from a solid 3 to a 4 is the value and service. Seriously, a chopped or caesar salad for 3.95? 5-7pm Happy Hour that includes half off starters, pizzas, and glasses of wine, wow, for real!   So with that being said we had a great time at Marcella's, yes folks a chain, but a decent chain with only a few locations in Ohio. The straight forward menu makes for easy navigation and the helpful suggestive service was more than enough to make decisions easy.   Okay, we kinda freaked out when  we heard the half off starts and pizzas.. we ordered way to much but was so worth it.   Started with the meaty Sicilian pizza, topped with Capacola, Salami, Meatballs, Asiago Cheese, Red Onion, which was probably my favorite. The crust was thin and crunchy and all of the flavors of the meats and cheese really were balanced so I could taste each with one bite after the next.  Beef Carpaccio was a close runner up with its thinly shaved rare beef, toasted capers and wild arugula. The flavors were bright thanks in part to the lemon aioli.  The Braised Veal Meatball was so light and tender I wanted to order another as my entree rather than the Gnocchi con Bolognese . The problem with the gnocchi was the gnocchi themselves. Kind of like eating raw biscuit dough, but the lamb bolognese was simple and delicious.   The Chicken Parmesan was served how I like to eat with both alfredo & tomato sauce. My only wish is that it had just a bit more sauce so I could use the house ciabatta to sop up the extra.   Desserts are kept simple like the rest of the menu so we shared with Cherry Crustada. The crust was light and flaky, the cherries filling slightly tart and the ice cream rich and creamy, *pant pant* yum!  This was certainly a pleasant experience with a welcoming laid back feel, generous portions and affordable pricing. Oh yes, they also use Opentable.com for free online reservations, so yes, I'm definitely a fan!!!

Had another excellent meal here and was able to try many different item. The Melted Pecorino Cheese ($9.50) was wonderful. Melty cheese, fresh sliced granny smith apples, crostini and honey made for many different tastes and contrasts with each bite.   For my entree I tried the Fettuccine & Meatball ($13.95) which was a different take on the classic. Their alfredo sauce tasted fresh and bold, plus the fist sized meatball was so tender it barely held its shape. Fantastically delicious!  They also get their house bread from Arizona Bread Company, which was light, soft and had just the right amount of chewy crustiness.   I dig this place, haven't had a bad time yet! Though the service was a bit off this last time. We seemed to be blown off once another table was sat next to us, we still had a great time.  BTW.. if you're having trouble finding parking, there is a garage just west of the restaurant to an underground parking facility.

Modern Burger is a little blue burger window inside Scottsdale Fashion Square, alongside the latest Sam Fox venture, Modern Steak.  I visited three times before I found Modern Burger open, and on that visit the place quickly closed up as they called my name and I grabbed the bag of food.  There are five items on the menu. Orders are placed at the window.  On this visit, the window was crowded with four teen-somethings who refused to move as the staff looked on helplessly. Finally, a look was thrown in their direction and two of them moved while the others continued to hang out.  After ordering, customers can sit at one of the two communal tables and wait to be called. The food is served in a paper sack, ala fast food style.  While I waited, one of the staff approached me and asked if I needed ketchup. As I shook my head and replied, he slammed down several packets of ketchup and hustled off. There is nothing like sharp and attentive service to make you feel valued.  But I have to say that the food was pretty darn tasty, starting with the Chopped Turkey Salad ($5.75). While it did come pre-made out of a refrigerator, the freshness was still present. Chopped lettuce, roasted turkey and corn, tomato, cucumber, cheddar and boiled egg, while fresh, were all sadly under dressed. A small container of dressing was provided, but since the place had closed, more could not be requested.  The Sliders ($5.75) came two to an order and are, as you'd expect, two small burgers. They're served on a house-made bun, which is more like focaccia bread rather than something more traditional. The beef was cooked medium rare and was tender and juicy. In fact, it was so juicy that the lack of napkins became apparent, and with no one to ask..   The top-notch house fries were perfectly seasoned on the salty side and had a nice toothsome crunch.  For dessert, Modern Burger offers ice cream sandwiches ($2.75), but once more we were denied since the place had closed.  The food was tasty but, with strange hours and crude service, I can't understand why they even opened. The place seems more like an afterthought.

"Cook with love, cook like you mean it." These are wise words coming from hard working local chef and restaurateur Tottie Kaya. After several visits to her latest outpost, Tottie's Asian Fusion 2, I'm thoroughly convinced that she cooks some of the best Asian food in town.  Her latest outlet is located at Lincoln Village near the intersection of Scottsdale Road and Lincoln Boulevard. The space she chose has been at least 3 different restaurants that I know of, the last being an Italian eatery. The owners of Lincoln Village are spending millions to make sure that the buildings are more accessible and observed from the street. To help guarantee her latest venture will be successful, she uses feng shui to create and direct a balance of energy in the space. Not only is their a sense of volume with the high ceilings, but the dark wood floor and furniture speak a casual elegance that will invite you to linger over a ochoko of sake.  It's an Asian tour menu featuring items from Thailand, Vietnam and China. "Each dish has a balance, salty, sweet, sour, umami" as Tottie described when talking about her dishes. High quality ingredients are sourced through local purveyors including multi-weekly trips to LeeLee Asian Market for amazingly fresh basil and other essential herbs. These flavors come through with every bite as you make your way through a plate of Tottie Rolls ($7.50). Crispy deep fried rolls filled with a mixture of ground pork. Many of the appetizers are interactive, in this case you wrap a roll in a lettuce leaf with added cilantro and mint. Then dip into Tottie's version of the Vietnamese condiment nc chm, a slightly sweet vinaigrette dipping sauce. The all so tender Sugarcane Chicken ($9.95) gets the same hands on treatment. Minced chicken meatballs skewered onto sugarcane but this time you dip into an out of this world peanut sauce. If peanut sauce is your thing, don't miss out on the ultra moist Chicken Satay ($6.50). Both come with a flaming pot to add an additional element of crispiness and char to each piece, thoughtful.  Tottie's mastery of balance and presentation is apparent in the Sizzling Rice Soup ($7.95). Hot toasted rice is poured over a large serving of stock including vegetables and shrimp; creating a loud sizzle that will turn the heads of fellow diners. The flavors of this dish are mild and delightful but the key to pure enjoyment is the contrast in textures. Adding a small spoonful of the house made chili oil adds heat and a slight toasty sweetness.  Salad lovers will enjoy the bright and sweet Mango Shrimp Salad ($11.50). This salad is piled with large tender crustaceans and sliced mango seasoned with ginger, mint and lemon. The classic Vietnamese salad Bun Tom ($9.50) is paid a loving tribute. A large bowl filled with rice noodles and charbroiled pork, shrimp, Tottie rolls, lettuce and mint is so light, yet oh so satisfying.  Noodle addicts can rejoice with the chewy chow fun laden Pad Kee Mao, with your choice of chicken ($9.95), beef ($10.50) and shrimp ($11.95). You indicate your level of heat from mild to spicy however the sauteed vegetables add crunch and cool. If you you'd prefer to go all out order Tottie's Pan Fried Noodles ($11.95). A massive pile of egg noodles are fried crispy on the outside tender on the inside are covered with veggies, beef, chicken and shrimp. The light brown sauce does a great job getting into every nook and cranny of the noodle cavern.  There are also Chinamerican dishes offered for those seeking comfort classics such as General Tao's Chicken ($9.95), Kung Pao Beef ($10.50) and Shrimp with Garlic Sauce ($11.95). If you don't see something on the menu that suits you completely, just ask and they can make adjustments for dietary restrictions and allergies. Tottie is an expert at preparing meals on the fly or if you're not sure what you'd like to have, just leave it to her and she will take great care to make sure you have something tasty.  Desserts seem sinful and richly decedent, though surprisingly are all dairy free. You'd never know after a taste of her smooth and luscious ice creams; all made with coconut milk. She makes 8 flavors and flavors do change often, to get the most out of a visit we ordered the House-Made Ice Cream Sampler ($12.95) which has 8 different flavors. Favorites were the coconut, pineapple, avocado and the intense Vietnamese coffee, but I did find myself licking the bowl clean of the rocky road. For something not quite as rich the Pumpkin Custard ($6.50) not only clears up any residual spicy heat from dinner but felt like good healthy eating. That feeling of healthful lightness also comes when ordering the freshly sliced Mango with Sticky Rice ($6.50). Sweet and tender mango resting on top of sticky and chewy rice with a drizzle of sweetened coconut milk was a delight.  While Tottie's most certainly has great service and killer food, it's her heart, soul and passion that goes into this place that makes it truly stand out.

Last night Tottie cooked me up a special "diet" plate. She started with fresh steamed shrimp, chicken and dry fried those with cabbage, red pepper and onion then finished with fresh spring onion and cilantro. Let me tell you, it was amazing! No oil, no sugar, no starch but ALL flavor!   Along side she brought me a dish of spicy Tottie sauce which is made from vinegar, chile and garlic.. again sugar free but still packed with complexity flavors and major heat!   Tottie is just an amazing chef, owner and person. Even this morning I'm still reeling about the experience I had at Totties last night, I felt just like family.

As we arrived at FnB we immediately felt right at home. There was a faint smell of toasted marshmallows in the air and the hustle and bustle of Chef Charlene Badman's small open kitchen felt like being at mom's. The warm glow of owner/manager Pavle Milic's face fortified the welcome feeling.  Short for Food and Beverage, FnB seems to have everything aligned for culinary greatness. With food and service worthy of a long-established restaurant, you'd be surprised that FnB has been open only a few months.  Located in Old Town Scottsdale, the space formerly housed the famed Sea Saw. The bar surrounds the small open kitchen, with views of Badman and Sous Chef Sacha Levine working their magic. Or, if romance is in the air, opt for a table for two. FnB is cozy and intimate.  Farm fresh, seasonal and comforting describe Badman's creative and fun menu. Even something as simple as Citrus Marinated Olives ($4) just tastes better with a touch of orange peel.  The menu is not large, with only a handful of nibbles, appetizers, sides and entrees. On one visit, our knowledgeable waiter didn't even bat an eye when we ordered just about everything on the menu.  Lightly dusted in semolina flour then flash fried, each crustacean of the Crispy Rock Shrimp and Jalapeno Tartar ($9) has a nice feathery crunch. Fried Green Tomatoes with Green Goddess Dressing and Feta ($11) combines classic components, yet brings something new and balanced to the table.  Braised Leeks, Mozzarella, Mustard Bread Crumbs and a Fried Egg ($13) are as simple as they sound, but tastier than you'd imagine. This is the beauty of Badman's cooking: farm-fresh produce prepared with love and attention.  Since it is based on seasonal bounties, the menu is always changing, so don't be surprised when your favorite dish is no longer available. During several visits I had the opportunity to try something new each time.  Try not to fall in love with the pasta offering -- on one visit the pasta was a Garganelli and other times it was Strozzapreti ($19). Both were perfect, cooked al dente and served with local veggies.  Blue Nose Bass, Snap Peas, Hazelnuts and Citrus Sauce ($21) was fresh and light, yet meaty and satisfying.  Roast Jidori Chicken ($20) sounds like a cooking preparation, so I was surprised that it's actually a breed of Japanese chicken. Smaller than your standard chicken, it's amazingly flavorful and juicy. As one of my dining mates put it, "It tastes how chicken used to taste." Each succulent bite reminded me of how simple ingredients in expert hands can be so fulfilling.  Grilled Broccoli, Meyer Lemon Aioli and Crispy Onion ($6) is one of the sides. The smokiness of the slight char on the broccoli is alluring and adds an exotic dimension to something that would otherwise be ordinary.  Badman's desserts are handled with as much love and care as the rest of our experience, which made them all the sweeter. Topped with whipped cream and finished with a grating of nutmeg, each joyous spoonful of the Butterscotch Pudding ($7) brought comfort and delight.   Looking into the kitchen, I could see plumes of smoke in the air as a ramekin filled with Mint Chocolate Creme Brulee ($7) was getting seared with an iron.  It all made sense as burning sugar filled the air, like roasting marshmallows at a campfire. It's one of those things you long to come back to -- home.

As I sit here drinking my double espresso from the newly opened Buzzberry, I contemplate the whole support your local business model.   While I do my best to support local business I know that that the businesses I support are good. Why waste dollars on a business when they have a mediocre product and or service? While the service at Buzzberry was nothing special, I was floored when we asked where they source their coffee. Three teenage somethings just stood there and stared at us blankly. You see Buzzberry touts its self as "local, small-batch artisan coffee and 100% fruit smoothies", so you'd think that they would have a selling line, telling us all about the coffee they're proud to serve. Ultimately one of the three said where they get their coffee from but only after moments of debate. As someone who loves and buys artisan products I felt that this was pretty much unacceptable.   So perhaps I'm being to harsh on them? They have only been opened a month and they are super close to the our homestead. Though as I sit here sipping on my double espresso I figured that they were the ones being a little harsh. Bitter.

There's an old saying, "it's always happy hour somewhere" that's used when trying to justify drinking in the morning or early afternoon. Between you and me day drinking isn't one of my strong suits and has to be justified for me to do it.  A great happy hour not only starts early but allows you enjoy well priced libations and food at great prices. That's when great happy hour specials come into play, such as at the recently discovered 5th and Wine in Old Town Scottsdale. Opened by the same owners as the fantastic Humble Pie and the new Living Room Wine Bar in Chandler, they create a space that's welcoming, relaxed and comfortable. Service is polished with an attractive and eager staff that seem genuine and friendly.  Day drinkers can delight from 3pm-7pm daily, including weekends, with 5th & Wines great happy hour with glasses of wine priced at $5. The deals don't stop there, also offering a short list of fantastic draft beers and well drinks both at only $4.  5th and Wine also offers several well priced appetizers to pair up with one of their amazing wines. Salty cured meats always taste so good while sipping drinks, and the Prosciutto Wrapped Breadsticks ($4) filled the ordered perfectly. They take long thin bread sticks then wrap them with thin slices of cured pork and finish them horseradish cream, incredibly addictive.  Served with crunchy jicama and ranch dressing for dipping, the Spicy Chicken Drumettes ($4) might be the best deal on the menu. In total there were 12 plump and meaty drumettes that were cooked until tender then slathered in a spicy vinegary wing sauce, basic I know but executed perfectly.  The center piece to all of the eating and drinking were definitely the Bruschetta ($9.95 for 6). Starting with a thick slab of toasted artisan bread, you choose from 8 different preparations ranging from mild to sublime. Standouts included a tasty peppercorn crusted steak with dollops of nose clearing creamy horseradish and for the wine centric, apples with brie and fig jam which was then drizzled with honey and agave syrup. After trying so many, my absolute favorite had prosciutto, mascarpone cheese, figs and tomato jam. Salty, sweet, creamy and chewy, this touched on everything I love about well prepared Bruschetta.  At these prices you can easily put together a hearty meal but why stop there? 5th and Wine also offers a great selection of salads, sandwiches entrees and daily specials on their regular menu.  Not to be missed, the 5th and Wine Burger ($11.95) starts with all natural ground beef then is topped with Cambozola or White Cheddar, caramelized onions and organic arugula. I opted for the addition of an organic fried egg for only $1.50 more which added the creaminess of hot egg yolk to each beefy bite. Almost as good as the burger, the 5th Ave Sausage ($10.95) uses Schreiner's sausage, caramelized onions, roasted peppers, arugula and whole grain mustard on toasted focaccia. However on my last visit, like the burger, the sausage was served on tender flaky brioche, a perfect substitute.  Just think in the time it took to read this another happy hour started.

It simply amazes me when a restaurant chooses the route of "ground up". This means that they make most of the ingredients themselves right there on premises. Let's take Pizza Chicago for instance, they make their own bread, dough, sauce and even hand trim and grind their own house-blended sausage. Why do some go through this much trouble? Think about it, if you have control over most aspects of your product then your actually performing quality control in real time. You know the meat is fresh, you know the bread was just baked; all of this hard work shows intense passion and dedication.   Located in what used to be a Hungry Howies, Pizza Chicago is all about take out. There is a table and bench if you'd like to wait for your order but Id suggest calling ahead and just picking up your order. Their deep-dish pizzas take a while to bake as I found out when getting there early and waiting for 20 excruciating minutes for my pie. For the wait I ended up ordering a loaf of their Garlic Bread ($1.50), but be careful, one slice of that airy butter and garlicky laden loaf will lead into another, and another. Remember, save room for the main event!  What's pizza without Chicken Wings ($8.99 for 14)? Or any meal for that matter! Served with your list of usual suspects, ranch dressing and celery sticks, these chicken flappers were nice and sloppy with plenty of BBQ sauce and honey to satisfy any savory sweet cravings you might have.  Pizza Chicago is known for their pan pizza but they also make a killer Thin Crust Pizza ($16.99 plus $1.75 each topping). Cut into squares, the Chicago way, the pizza was so light a hefty eater could devour the entire pie in one sitting. Don't look at me like that; I didn't eat the whole thing, I swear!  I can't go on enough about PC's Original Pan-Style Pizza ($13.99 plus $2 each topping) but I will anyway. Over 2" thick and completely filled with gooey mozzarella cheese, fresh tomato sauce and their house made sausage, it was a sight to behold. The first thing you taste is the cornmeal crust, so buttery and flavorful with a crunchy exterior that melds into a soft pillowy interior. The mozzarella in all of its stringy delight has that slight saltiness that meshes with the meaty flavors of the sausage. At the end is the big bright finish with the acid from the tomato sauce that just cuts right through the richness of the pizza. This was a sublime moment for me.   It's no surprise when I mention that they also make their own cookies for dessert. I ended up ordering the Peanut Butter and Chocolate Cookie ($3.50), which wasn't as big as I was thinking for the price though it was a top-notch cookie. They bake them fresh to order so when I got it home it was still warm and gooey and it paired well with a tall glass of milk.  When the taste for deep-dish pizza strikes, know that the folks behind Pizza Chicago do it right, from the ground up.

Honest and approachable the new Toast Breakfast Boutique will most certainly be added to my list of favorites. Located next door to where Drip Coffee Lounge was housed this place is both quirky and comfortable.   Ingredients are sourced as local as possible including bread from M.J. Bread and coffee from Xanadu Coffee Co.. The menu is simple and easily approached with only a few items to choose from.   Knowing that the bread if from M.J. I knew this was going to be great and it was. Starting off with the Fig Jam and Mascarpone Cheese on Marbled Rye Toast ($4); I hit the ground running. Each ingredient worked so well naturally together Id order this every time. Roasted Tomatoes with Mozzarella Cheese on Cibatta Toast ($6) was as good as it gets though for breakfast? Oh yeah!  Toast also served what they call the N.Y.C. sandwich. Completely custom from the bread up, you choose your egg, meats, cheese and veggies. I tried the perfectly flaky croissant with medium cooked egg, bacon, tomato, spinach and cheddar cheese ($8.50). I was surprised on the first bite when I realized that they actually cooked the egg medium. The yolk was just slightly runny and the whites completely solid, so who ever is cooking in the kitchen knows how to cook an egg right! Next time though I hold the tomato, while tasty on its own I think the sandwich would have been better off without it, dulled the flavors slightly.  Also tried the ciabatta with hard egg, bacon, onion and Havarti cheese. Once again the egg was perfectly cooked and all of the flavors came through. The ciabatta was perfectly chewy yet not difficult to eat. This combo was a sure fire hit!  Friendly, approachable, interesting and sincere are all qualities that I admire and try to live by. Toast Breakfast Boutique, not only seems to share those same qualities but never pretends to being something it's not.

Back in the day, resorts and hotels were some of the best culinary destinations around. The Fairmont Scottsdale, formerly known as the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess, was one of those shining examples of upscale greatness with its Marquesa and La Hacienda restaurants. With new owners came new ideas, and both establishments were shuttered to make way for culinary concepts, including the fantastic Bourbon Steak by Chef Michael Mina.   Now, with the help of chef Richard Sandoval, La Hacienda is re-opening with an updated look and menu.  Sandoval grew up in Mexico City working with his restaurateur father. His upbringing helped to fuel a passion that led to multiple accolades and a reputation for innovative Latin cuisine. He opened his own restaurant in 1997 and over the years he's opened several more star-awarded restaurants.  La Hacienda has always been known for great margaritas. The traditional La Hacienda ($10) is still the tops, but one of the new comers, the El Pina Diablo ($11) uses pineapple and serrano chile infused tequila and is refreshing and subtly spicy.   In the bar, the daily happy hour runs from 5 to 7 p.m. and features $5 margaritas and snacks ranging from guacamole to tacos.  The dinner menu has been designed to combine "the bold taste of classic Mexican cuisine with timeless European cooking techniques." Starting at the top, you can't go wrong with crunchy Chips and Guacamole ($9.50). The appetizer was fresh and delicious, thanks in part to the tableside preparation of the guacamole. Diners can request their preferred level of spiciness while severs prepare the guacamole.  The Queso Fundido ($9) is served in a searing hot cast iron skillet for good reason -- to keep that cheese molten. A winning combination of melted Oaxaca, Chihuahua and Monterrey cheeses, with chorizo or mushrooms atop, fills the soft house-made flour tortillas perfectly.  Ceviche is one of those dishes that can be disastrous or outstanding, Sandoval and Hamrick served up the latter. The Ceviche Tasting ($10) offers two selections tender rock shrimp with avocado accented with chile habanero or mahi mahi, bathed in a citrus tomato broth, and hinted with just enough chile serrano for another layer of flavor. Both were outstanding, especially when tasted with the accompanied bowl of house-made corn nuts. It's a great texture!  Ever heard of huitlacoche? Also known as corn smut, a type of fungus that grows on corn and is considered a delicacy in Mexico. Call it whatever you like, it's delicious earthen taste shouldn't be missed when eating the Tamal de Huitalcoche ($9). A tamal is the same as tamale, though in this case the masa has been infused with the complex flavors of the huitalcoche, filled with goat cheese and zucchini and drizzled with truffle oil. I felt like a Mayan king eating this.  After trying the Chipotle BBQ Chicken Salad ($12), I felt confused. With so many original dishes, why bother with a salad like this? While the ingredients were top notch and it tasted fine, the ordinariness left me scratching my head.   Making up for this was the Quesadilla ($9), which might sound typical, but after one bite that idea was dispelled. With various fillings, these crispy-on-the-outside, dreamy-on-the-inside quesadillas made for great dipping into the red and green salsas. Fant√°stico!  Huachinango a la Veracruzana ($26) is a traditional Veracruz style red snapper dish. This gorgeous piece of fish gets a spin with the smoked bacon fufu. A mash of plantains had just enough sweet to balance out the acidic flavor of the tomato, olive and caper sauce.  My favorite entr√©e, and an instant classic, was the Costilla de Res ($27). The melt-in-your-mouth beef short rib was not only braised, but received a second flavor enhancing method in a smoker. The generous serving of meaty richness was countered by a creamy potato puree and chile habanero and guava sauces.  Desserts are surprisingly light yet still satisfyingly delicious. The Flan de Coco ($9) was perfectly luscious and silky. By contrast, the Churros ($9) had a delightful crunch with a sponge-like interior that absorbed the three different dipping sauces perfectly. La Hacienda also offers house-made ice cream ($8) that includes an avocado version that so good, you might ask for another scoop.  After dessert, coffee is spectacular. The server wheeled out a cart and became not only a mixologist but a pyrotechnician. The columns of burning cinnamon are so beautiful and leave a wonderfully smoky cinnamon smell lingering. These chocolaty rich coffee libations might be a little over the top and full of liquor, but they really shouldn't be missed.  If you have a little too much to drink at La Hacienda you are at one of Scottsdale's finest resorts. Perhaps you can book a night in one of their romantic rooms and make it a mini staycation.  The team at La Hacienda has done a great job paying close attention to the past, but they've set in motion an evolution for a bright and tasty future.

Its a cleaner. They're fast, friendly and priced decently. I paid just under $18 for 6 shirts most were simply laundered and ironed while 1 of the shirts went to dry cleaning.   My clothes came out clean and smelling fresh so I now smell clean fresh which makes me and anyone standing close to me very happy.  PS.. they're located right next to Jamba Juice if you want to grab a wheat grass shot.

Im surprised that there aren't more home furnishing stores around Vegas. Where's Crate and Barrel, CB2, Jonathan Adler, hell even Ikea? Fortunately there if you look a little harder you'll find what you seek.   Being new to Vegas the Mr and I were in desperate need of home furnishings for our new place, in comes West Elm.. we've shopped at West Elm many times in Scottsdale and have had a mixed bag of service though the products were always top notch. This location (located behind the Green Valley location of Cheesecake Factory) has only been amazing when it comes to customer service. All have been helpful and hardworking.   So we bought rugs, lighting and an entertainment center. The entertainment center was delivered with a few chips in the finish but within 1 phone call they picked they picked it up and brought us a new one. Now that's great customer service!  While our place is getting there it's going to be a work in progress for quite some time. Im happy that there's a West Elm here, it really fits our style.

Stefano Fabbri, owner of Pomo Pizzeria, is not only passionate about his food, but he has a contagious enthusiasm that's informative and downright convincing.  The Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana at the Borgota in Scottsdale is a sleek and beautiful space. The dining room has soaring ceilings, dark furniture and a mural showing someone riding a scooter in the streets of Italy. It appears to be another trendy, albeit sexy, pizzeria, but it's actually more than that.  Pomo recently earned a certification from the Naples-based Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana, meaning that everything from the flour, olive oil, kneading and baking meets exacting standards. This is a pretty big deal considering there are only a few dozen restaurants in the country that have this certification. But the staff doesn't let the honor go to their heads; service is friendly and attentive.  Pizza is the name of the game here, and seeing it prepared is a blast. In the open part of the kitchen you'll see a classic red Berkel meat slicer used to prepare the selection of cured meats. This is one serious meat slicer that I can only dream of having in my own kitchen. To see it in action I ordered the Affettati Misti ($14.95), a plate filled with the chef's choice of paper-thin slices of bresaola, prosciutto, salami, olives and cheese.  At lunchtime, Pomo serves a handful of Paninis, but these are not the typical grilled sandwiches. They quick bake fresh dough in a blistering hot oven that yields a slightly charred, yet light and crispy bread. Then they stuff it full of Italian goodness, like the Salami Panini ($9.95), which was filled with spicy salami, arugula and mozzarella cheese. Served with a simple side salad, the panini was excellent and satisfying.  Like the panini, pizzas are cooked in a wood-fired oven at around 900 degrees. This means that a pizza takes only about a minute and a half to cook. By Naples standards, the pizzas are decidedly thin though surprisingly the crust isn't ultra crispy as one might expect. Instead the crust is light and moist with an excellent toothsome chew.  Fabbri recommended starting with the basics, and since he'd know best, ordering the Regina Margherita ($11.95) was on point. The tomato sauce was bright and sweet, then the flavor of the milky fresh mozzarella kicked in which was enhanced by fresh chopped basil.  Another way to enjoy the stupendous crust was the Calzone Napoletano ($14.95), which is not your run of the mill calzone. It was filled with spicy salami, tomato sauce, mozzarella and ricotta. Each creamy bite deserved another, as I wickedly ate the whole thing.  What better way to end than to order dessert? While they do have standards like Tiramisu ($7.95) and Panno Cotta ($7.95), the light and airy Semifreddo Di Mandorle ($7.95) was a standout. Each bite of the partially frozen mousse was accented with a toasted pistachio crust. More please.  With a passion for tradition, this might be as close to an authentic Italian pizza as you'll get without going to Italy.

There's just something in a restaurant's name that will lure me for a visit. Like Al's Beef. Those words together conjure up fantastical images of hunky blue collared workers. You know the ones; they work hard and play harder, each one starving, looking to get his fill of Al's thick juicy Italian Beef sandwiches.  In 1938, Al's Beef opened as a food stand in Chicago's Little Italy. The idea for the Italian Beef sandwich came during the Depression when meat was scarce. So, in order to help stretch the meat to feed more people, the roasted beef was shaved extremely thin, then made into sandwiches.  Over the years, Al's flourished, earning accolades such as Best Sandwich in America from Esquire, Playboy and others. They were even featured earlier this year on one of my favorite TV shows, Man vs. Food, in an episode titled "Da Italian Stance."  In Chicago, there's an art to eating an Al's Italian Beef sandwich. In the "Italian Stance," the diner's knees are slightly bent, posterior slightly up and out and elbows on the counter. This technique helps to avoid getting Al's gravy on your shoes. It's not the traditional gravy you might think of putting on mashed potatoes, but more like the pan drippings from the roasted beef they dunk the entire sandwich in, bread and all.  Unfortunately, all of this amazing history and media attention doesn't seem to matter to the new franchised location in North Scottsdale. The concept here is fast casual, order from the counter, then getting your number called a few minutes later to pick up your food.  The interior was spotlessly clean, the staff relatively friendly and the concept easy, what's not to like? Unfortunately, the food.  I started with the Big Al ($7.45), the 8-inch version of their Italian Beef sandwiches. I want to eat it like Chicagoans do, so I ordered the sandwich dipped, then covered with hot giardiniera, a relish of pickled peppers and vegetables. Taking my position, with my butt in the air and my elbows on the counter top, I took the first bite. First I was amazed just how juicy the sandwich was. Then another surprise hit me -- the meat was almost flavorless.  I was so disappointed that after a few bites I decided to try a Chicago Dog ($3.10). But the hot dog was so small and shriveled I wasn't sure you could call it a hot dog; more like a hot mess.  There were a few highlights, including the delicious Bleu Cheese Fries ($4.50), perfectly cooked French fries covered with bleu cheese crumbles and dressing. Another treat was the Tamale Boat ($5.80), two Chicago-style tamales covered with chili, cheddar cheese and onions.  When one of the employees decided that it was time for Headbangers Ball, playing thrash metal over the restaurant's loudspeakers, I took it as my cue to leave.  Maybe this place should be renamed Al's French Fried Tamale Mosh Pit? Rock on man, rock on.

The owners of Verde have converted an old building into something modern and vibrant, a south-of-the-border neighbor for the restaurant row along First Street between Pierce and Garfield in downtown Phoenix.  The food here is made from scratch, including mouth-watering flour tortillas made by hand. You can taste the love. The only item on the menu that isn't made in-house is the tortilla chips, and those come from the legendary La Canasta.  It's fresh Mexican food with one surprise -- not one burrito is on the regular menu. How can this be? Simple, it's all about down-home plates filled with roasted chicken, red chile or their amazingly killer green chile.  Verde is a fast casual restaurant, so you order at the counter, then take a seat while the food is prepared.  First to arrive were the Chips and Salsa ($2.50), a large bag with perfectly crunchy chips accompanied by red and green salsas. The tang from the green salsa was bright and made my mouth water for more. While the red was good, I would have enjoyed a little more heat.  Weekends at Verde mean a handful of breakfast options, including a few coveted burritos. I couldn't stop eating the Green Chile with Beans and Eggs ($5). The spicy simmered pork was so tender and delightful that it was like green chile butter as I slathered the meat onto a piping hot flour tortilla. If you order only one thing from here, make it the green chile.  After the first bite of Red Chile Beef ($7) I was puzzled trying to figure out the exotic flavors. It's not your typical red chile; its flavors of clove reminded me of a cross between curry and mole, if that's even possible. Beans came along side and, with smoky notes from the addition of chorizo, are worthy of eating alone.  If chile isn't your thing, the roasted Oregano Lime Chicken ($8) is a great alternative. The meat was practically falling off the bone and right into the awaiting flour tortilla.  Beef Tacos ($7) were featured as a special on my last visit. Two corn tortillas are filled with tender stewed beef, then topped with shredded lettuce and chopped tomato. They are simple and satisfying, with the addition of a pinch of salt to bring out the sweetness of the beef.  With outstanding green chile, this place is called Verde for a reason. They've got some of the best green chile I've had in a long time, and don't forget the tortillas.

The menu at China Magic Noodle House represents the school of thought that if you're going to make just one thing, it's got to be good. They pretty much only serve one thing -- noodles.  Located in the Lee Lee shopping center in Chandler, the owners have done a great job of making the interior bright, clean and welcoming. Greeted with a smile, we were seated in the one of the generously sized booths, as if they knew about the feast we were going to order.  On the farthest wall a large window provides a view of the kitchen where the magic happens. After you place your order, you're welcome to go to the window and watch the noodle master go to work. Each order is hand pulled, something that's amazing to witness. I was put into a foodie-induced trance while he twisted and beat the dough. The noodle master makes it look so easy, but it takes a ton of practice and skill honing.  Wanting to attack the menu from all sides, we ordered a Chinese noodle feast. When the first dish arrived we knew we were in for a treat. The huge made-by-hand Pan Fried Dumpling ($4.95) was stuffed with seasoned minced pork. Alongside was a bowl of a vinegar-based dipping sauce, which brought a bright tang to each pork bite. I enjoyed the fact that the skin was thick since each bite was substantial and toothsome.  The Hot Spring Beef Tender ($4.50) was kind of a surprise when it arrived. My impression when ordering this dish was that it would be tender sliced beef, but when it arrived it was a plate full of paper-thin slices of spiced marinated beef tendon. I love beef tendon, so it wasn't much of a problem. Our waiter explained that the tendon is tender, and pointed out that the Marinated Beef ($4.50) was sliced beef.  There's a choice of five types of noodles, but we homed in on the hand-pulled version. They also offer wide noodles, shaved noodles, thick noodles and vegetable noodles.  Noodles with Minced Pork Sauce ($5.50) offered chewy bites studded with green onion and little pieces of ground pork. The noodles did a great job of absorbing all of the flavors of the dish. I'd order this one again.  Beef with Fried Noodles in XO Spicy Sauce ($7.95) is similar to a house lo-mein, but this was bursting with taste. The Spicy XO Sauce added a salty and savory dimension to the noodles and tender beef that was indeed spicy, but not overly so. If you need additional spice there is a jar of red chile oil on every table.  I jumped at the chance to try their version of Homemade Lemonade ($2). Sweet and tangy, this is how good lemonade should be made. The Homemade Lemon Tea ($2) pretty much bests any other Arnold Palmer. Both drinks did a great job of cutting through the richness of the highly flavored noodle dishes.  Similar to Vietnamese pho, Ox-Tail with Soup Noodles ($5.95) were so comforting, I can imagine these on a cold day warming your belly and your soul. The broth was complex and each bite of fall-off-the-bone tender ox-tail and chewy noodles were a joy to slurp.  The only negative thing I can say about China Magic Noodle House is that they aren't closer to where I live, though on second thought, this might be a good thing.

So my inner Vietnamese woman (iVw) has been seriously craving some yummy cookery and who am I tell a lady no. So we grabbed the mister and shuttled off to Kinh Do to satisfy her deepest cravings.   Service was quick, friendly and efficient. Our meals arrived with 5 minutes of being placed which made me think, can rushing a good thing comprise quality. At Kinh Do, no way! Hot fresh and ready to chow!  Bun Bo Hue - deep rich brother with a nice amount of dark red annatto oil over the top. The meats were incredibly tender with a nice amount of fat to add to the richness. There were a few pieces of blood cake which taste like liver and pennies. The killer  broth and the thick noodles satiated my iVw in no time.   Banh Mi - Vietnamese BBQ Pork. The issue with the banh mi wasn't with the tasty ample meats and veggies but with the bread which was dry and crumbly. A good banh mi is only as good as the bread its in. A great use for the bread was dunking it into the bun bo hue. So good! Like a Vietnamese French dip!  Me, the mister and my iVw were all very happy with Kinh Do and cant wait to go back and try a big steaming bowl of bun rieu. Crab and pork for the win! My iVw sleeps now until she's ready to feed once more.

She's sassy, she's charismatic, she's Maria Manno and if you've ever wanted to know what its like to have a gorgeous Italian mother, I mean younger sister, than I have the place for you, Gasper's Casual Italian Eatery. Along with husband Gasper we were made to feel like a part of their family with a laid back atmosphere, fantastic Italian food and some of the most reasonable prices I've seen with cooking of this quality.   While Maria is busy making sure everything is running smoothly in the dining room, Gasper is manning the open pizza kitchen. Let me tell you, he cranks out some mighty fine pies, no wonder the place is named after him, and they're spot on. Before you even get to taste the pizza your table is graced with a basket of freshly baked focaccia bread slathered in nutty olive oil. Be careful not to eat the whole thing, there is so much to try from pasta to plates all the Italian classics are covered.  There are two camps when it comes to Toasted Ravioli ($7). Some say that it's a Sicilian Christmas tradition taking ravioli filled with cheese then breaded and deep frying until crisp. While the other camp uses the same preparation, they claim it's strictly a St. Louis invention. Either way we're talking about one tasty belief system.   Fried Calamari ($10) is pretty much a mainstay on any menu these days, though few can manage a light fluffy crust while keeping the inside tender and flavorful. A generous squeeze of fresh lemon and a spoonful of marinara sauce and these crispy rings were as good as they get.  I'm not sure who Regina ($15) is, but she must have been pretty awesome to have a pizza like this one named after her. Thin slightly charred crust was crisp on the outside chewy on the inside topped with red sauce and cheese then finished with fresh sliced prosciutto, Parmigianino cheese and arugula. This was the perfect balance of salty cured meat countered by the peppery greens.   Another favorite the Quattro Formaggi ($13) has the same crust but is covered with mozzarella, fontina, Parmigianino and provolone. The cheeses all played off each other, a milkiness from the mozzarella, a little bit sharp and tangy from the fontina and provolone with a nutty finish from the Parmigianino, its not wine tasting but its certainly has a subtle complexity.   If you order one pasta dish make sure it's the Fettuccini all Burina ($14). Ribbons of toothsome pasta bathed in a light cream sauce then tossed with prosciutto, mushrooms and basil was simply perfect. My next favorite was the Rigatoni con Ricotta ($12), thick tubes of pasta were the perfect vehicle for the fresh cheese and tomato sauce, heart and comforting.  Don't even get me started about dessert, Maria makes all of them. The Cheesecake ($6.50) was fresh baked that it was still slightly warm. The only time I've had cheesecake like that was when I made it myself and let me tell you what, mine doesn't even compare. If available, be sure to ask about the fresh made Cream Puffs ($6.50). Made with layers of flaky dough then filled with banana or vanilla pastry cream and like the Manno family, they were warm and delightful.  Closed Mondays

Known for its flavorful menu of wraps, rice bowls and salads, That's a Wrap has offered healthy food on Seventh Street in Central Phoenix for more than 13 years. The new location, formerly occupied by Lola Tapas, serves up the same affordable food and laid back atmosphere as the original with a fresh, contemporary interior and more space for dining, both indoors and out.   If you've never had a wrap before it's a pretty straight forward design. Take all of your favorite sandwich ingredients, meat, cheese, tomato and dressing then surround them with a tender tortilla and there you have it. The wraps here are generously filled and could satiate some of the biggest appetites, including my own.   The Buffalo 66 ($7.25) encompasses everything that you love about eating chicken wings, my favorite. Were talking thick juicy pieces of grilled chicken, shredded carrots, celery and spicy wing sauce all wrapped up in a herb flavored tortilla. One of the things I enjoy most about this wrap is the contrast between the heat from the sauce and the cooling effect of the dressing, spot on in every bite.   One of the wraps I was most excited about was also the most disappointing I tried. Ordering the Clubster ($7.25) is supposed to get you turkey, ham, bacon, provolone cheese, corn bread stuffing, tomatoes, and lettuce dressed in tomato vinaigrette all wrapped with a wheat tortilla. The problem here was that there were no hints of smoky bacon or savory turkey, just a bland mix of ham, veggies and stuffing. Tearing my wrap open, neither of the two were present as far as I could tell. I'm not writing this one off yet, next time Ill ask them to double check their ingredients.   For the lighter appetite, I use that term loosely, you could order one of their massive salads. Served in a crispy tortilla shell, the Picnic Salad ($7.75) was brimming with fresh spinach, blue cheese crumbles, toasted walnuts all lightly bathed in a wonderfully pungent balsamic dressing. For an additional charge ($.75) you can add tender grilled chicken to the mix.    Each order comes with your choice of chips and salsa, pasta salad, fruit salad or daily soup. Trying a few of the sides, I loved the freshness of their salsa, with little flecks of black char from roasted vegetables. I'd highly recommend my favorite, their homemade pasta salad. The firm texture of their bow tie pasta was additively well dressed; I could have eaten a huge bowl if it were offered.   Sometimes the simplest things are the tastiest like really well done baked goods. TAW doesn't disappoint with their delicious Carrot Cake ($2.75). Each bite had a nice chewiness from the cream cheese frosting and dense moist crumb of the cake. The spices were well balanced and I loved that there were flecks of shredded carrot you could actually see in every forkful.   Be sure to check their website for specials including great deals on bottles and glasses of wine. I know where I'll be on Saturday night.

2 words my friends, Adobado Fries!  They take a large to-go box and fill it with thin crispy fries then they start loading on the goodies. We're talking thin porky slices of spit roasted adobado (this seems like al pastor to me but hey whatever), cheese, sour cream and guacamole. If you're really hungry I guess you could use your fingers to attack the fries from the side where there are less toppings, good luck with that. I stuck with the fork and made sure to get a little bit of everything in each bite. Dang this are good. I'd like to start calling them "Fuck Yeah Fries"!   After a night of tiki'ing at Frankie's this is the place to nosh your buzz into a more manageable state.

Weekend mornings I'm all about being a complete lazy bear, sleeping in then get up just long enough to lie back down on the couch. Only a few have the power to lure me out of bed and one of those is the promise of a big satisfying breakfast. Of course not by my own hand but by someone elses because lets face it, I'm that lazy on the weekends.  So when I decided to cover the much buzzed about Joe's Diner it was sheer excitement that got me out of bed. You know a plate full of perfectly cooked eggs and bacon paired lovingly with cups of hot coffee and glasses of fresh squeezed orange juice are true motivators.  As we saunter in we're welcomed by an upbeat good morning and sat pretty much immediately. Located in what used to be a classic car shop, husband and wife team Joan and Joe Seriale transport you back in time with 1950's nostalgia complete with glitter flecked seating and old tin billboards and neon signs. There's a flurry of waitresses and I kept waiting for Flo to appear with her huge red nest of hair but she never showed up.  Concerning breakfast there's always that one nagging question, should I go savory or sweet? I say do both starting out with one of Joe's homemade Cinnamon Rolls ($2.59). The large yeasty bun arrived laying in its own caramelized brown sugar and cinnamon pool, complete with an oozing topping of cream cheese frosting. I nearly stabbed my partner with my fork after he took the best part, the tender loved filled center. When I eat a cinnamon roll I like take my sweet time, licking and nibbling on the outside, making sure I don't miss an inch of that roll. Then once I get to the center I'm gratefully rewarded with a mouthful of gooey pleasure.  The Number Two ($6.49) is the more versatile choice when it comes to the sweet and savory dilemma. You get two eggs, your way, two sausage patties, two bacon strips and a short stack of fluffy pancakes. This plate has your bases covered with the addition of thick ropes of maple syrup which the pancakes gladly guzzle down. For an alternative try the strawberry jam in lieu of the syrup, some rules were meant to be broken.  Joe's Homemade Biscuits & Gravy ($2.99) gets you a plate full of light-as-air biscuits grounded by a layer of sausage gravy. The gravy had a faint sweetness that was a surprise hit at our table.  If you're having a rough morning from one-to-many last night, try this remedy, Joe's Breakfast Burrito ($6.59). Stuffed tight into a soft flour tortilla are three scrambled eggs, chorizo, potatoes, and cheddar cheese served with a sides of sour cream and salsa. Or try the Breakfast Bowl ($7.59) which gets you scrambled eggs with ham, bacon and cheddar cheese served over home style potatoes. Both were filling and satisfying, the only thing was a couch afterwards to nap on.  I foresee Joe's Diner getting me out of bed many more times in the near future, especially after dreaming about cinnamon rolls.

I remember back in the day when Mill Avenue was the place to go to eat, party and have a good time. There were movies theaters, plenty of places to grab a drink a bite and do some quick shopping. Well with the development of Tempe Marketplace and the crash of the economy both took their toll on the once beloved street. However some might disagree saying that Mill had lost its college town feel in lieu of a corporate take over. These days most of the corporations are gone and the empty commercial space is being slowly back filled with locally owned businesses, like the new stylish eatery, Canteen Modern Tequila Bar.   Opened by the same owner as my favorite La Bocca Urban Pizzeria, Canteen is located along Mill Avenue across the street from the pizzeria. Inside you'll find a hip contemporary space tinged with a Mexican rusticity like crushed vintage velvet booths and space age lighting elements. If you love tequila this will probably be your new drinking shrine, Canteen has more than 100 different tequilas to choose from. If you prefer your tequila mixed go for one of their expertly mixed cocktails including the blue agave and orange infused desert prickly pear ($6.50), I love a tangy buzz.  In the kitchen pretty much everything is made from scratch on sight, this was apparent after the first bite Mexico City Style Quesadilla ($9). Feathery hand formed masa is formed around roasted chicken then crowned with avocado, radish and a spicy tomato coulis. The quesadilla was so light it was like eating corn flavored air. Simple salads like the Grilled Steak with Romaine ($10) was adorned with cherry tomatoes, avocado and had just enough chipotle vinaigrette dressing to enhance the fresh produce not mask it.  If you want something with more heft order the Carne Asada Torta ($10). At first taste the beefy grilled flavors came bursting through only to meld with the gooey Oaxacan cheese. Pickled red and poblano peppers did an excellent job of cutting though the richness of the sandwich.   Flaky flour tortillas are also made in house and are one of the key components in the varied taco offerings. Fish Tacos ($9) were filled with beer battered fillet and fried until crispy and golden; a layer of spicy slaw completes the ensemble. Oh so light and oh so good but the real show stopper was yet to come. You know how much I love pork, so when I was so blown away by the Slow Roasted Achiote Pork Tacos ($9) that I actually ordered another plate full of three. The melt on your tongue pork was insanely additive and moist that for just a moment, nothing else existed.  Sweets were limited to only a few options but even then I was hard pressed not to order them all. Rum spiked Raisin and Cinnamon Rice Pudding ($6) was warm creamy and made me feel good all over. However the pudding was upstaged but the accompanied sopapillas. These were so warm and puffy; I filled each one with pudding for my own version of a hot pocket. I loved the delightful Trio of ice cream ($6) which included Horchata, Avocado Jalapeno and Chile Mango Sorbet. Though what's not to love, these were all made by our very own Sweet Republic.   I have a feeling if places like Canteen keep opening, the good old days of Mill are just starting to begin.

I've often used the word Chinamerican to help describe food being made at some Chinese restaurants. This type Americanized Chinese cookery usually includes the same suspects like sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, lo mein and can be found pretty much anywhere except Old Town Scottsdale.   Now the owners of Geisha A Go Go and Stingray Sushi have opened another Asian concept capturing the essence of Chinamerican, Jimmy Woo's. While cool and modern inside, they somehow managed to pay homage to the type of Chinese restaurants I knew when I was a kid. There are no white and pink table cloths here but the half moon shaped black leather booths, dim lighting and old school Chinese menu evokes a 70's mod vibe. Be sure to check out the enormous abacus, it'll be the largest you'll ever see. Outdoors, Woo's has a fantastic patio that faces Scottsdale Road which is great for people watching.  Woo's offers a daily happy hour that starts at 3pm, which gets you drink discounts and a well priced small plates menu. Offerings such as plump and juicy Pan Fried Pork Dumplings ($4) and a plate full of fork tender, lightly fried Salt and Pepper Calamari ($5.25) are stand outs. If you pair these with a carafe of hot Sake ($4), happy hour could be a meal in of itself.  Looking over you'll notice that it's all about the classics and these classics are done pretty well, starting with Hot and Sour Soup ($5.95). Yes this is on every single Chinese menu around town but Woo's version adds tofu, mushrooms, egg, bamboo and chicken making for a hearty robust soup. Be sure to ask for some chili paste, the nose clearing effect is like tasty medicine.   After one bite of the Chinese Chicken Salad ($8.95), you couldn't help but notice that while well dressed in a peanut ginger dressing, it lacked any sort of flavor punch. Made with napa cabbage, carrot, bell pepper, snap peas and scallions then topped with fried noodles and almonds, the ingredients were vibrant and fresh. Hopefully they reconfigure their dressing since the added brightness from citrus juice or vinegar can be key to taking ho-hum to wow.   Slightly crispy, tender, sweet and sour tossed with bits of chili and citrus peel, the Orange Beef ($13.95) was decent. For me this is what Asian style cooking is all about, appealing to many of my senses without any one being overwhelmed. However on another visit this dish was so overly sweetened and gloopy that it was pretty much inedible. Different chef?  I thought it was funny the veggie only, Eggplant with Tofu and Mushroom ($15) dish was one of the most expensive on the menu. Don't get me wrong, this dish was tasty with its slightly sweet sauce and well cooked vegetables it's just priced oddly high. I found it  funny that many of the shrimp and scallop dishes are priced less than this one. Go figure.   Jimmy Woo's may woo you with its sophisticated yet fun atmosphere, but for me it was the friendly service and their ability to make Chinese hip and cool. I only wish the food was as hip and cool.

Well once again I'm the last one to the party. Beckett's Table has been buzzing away since opening in the old That's Italiano space late last year. I've tried so many times to get in but for whatever reason or another didn't make it. Well finally made it in and I have to say, I wish I hadn't been so damn fashionably late.   A couple of notable thing, the space is killer, rustic-industrial and second, the waiters are hot, especially our beefy ginger waiter Scott, Sam, hmm, maybe Bill? Anyway I can't remember his name but what I do remember was his attention to detail and service. Looking around you can see that all the servers were attentive and helpful to all their guests. I'm just a sucker for a beard, I mean great service.   In case you're wondering who Beckett is, the name refers to local Chef Justin Beckett. The man has got some chops and has nothing to hide in his open kitchen. I love open kitchens, I think its an honest way of sharing how clean and organized a well lubed kitchen works, in other words the orders slid in and out with total ease. The menu is made up mainly of meat + starch with a few flare items that while are mostly comforting, shows the levels of sophistication, especially for a neighborhood kind of restaurant.   At first glance the Country Pat√© ($12) seemed to be overwhelmed with way to many accompaniments. I'm a mustard and bread only kind of guy, but after trying each delicate bite with a different topping it all made sense. Each component is representative of a different tasting experience. Vinegary whole grain mustard is completely different than sun dried tomato making for an interesting and interactive experience.   Another surprise appetizer was the Creamy Grits & Schreiner's Sausage Trio ($9). I generally avoid grits simply because I've never really had them made well, though Beckett's version is as advertised, creamy and delicious. You can never go wrong with Schreiner's sausages, simply the best as far as I'm concerned. The only real let down was the Grilled Cheese ($9) served with bacon, four cheeses and roasted red pepper tomato soup. Every component was good except that main one, the bread, which was dry and not very tasty which made the entire dish unravel.   Entrees were meat-centric starting with the oh-so-tender Osso Buco ($18). A pork shank braised in its own fat was melting tender, served atop butternut spaetzle and pepper reduction. The braising continues with fork tender Short Ribs ($19) that were big and beefier in flavor thanks to a red wine and herb reduction.  What's a great way to round of such a rich meal? How about a slab of Fig and Pecan Pie ($6)? The sweetness really cuts through the richness from so many savory items. If you're still in the mood for unique, try the hands on Chocolate Dipped Bacon S'mores ($6). Yes, you read it right, slices of thick cut bacon that have been enrobed in chocolate. Once over the novelty, you realize that it's far too messy to finish.  I think the party at Beckett's is only getting started.

Oh great, another Thai restaurant, I thought to myself when I noticed the sign going up for Soi 4 located in Scottsdale's Shops at Gainey Village. There are so many new Thai restaurants popping up all over the valley, I have a hard time keeping up. The problem is that so many of them, more or less, have the same offerings and while Soi 4's menu is seemingly traditional, it's both modern and engaging. It's sister restaurant in Oakland, Ca was voted as one of the Bay areas best, seems they have some big shoes to fill.   Fortunately for me my dining companion is originally from Thailand. She brought her knowledge of Thai cooking which in turn gave Soi 4 street cred. We both fell in love with many of the dishes from the Keow Wan Roti ($8) a pan-fried Indian bread with grilled skirt steak and an out of this world Kao Pad Pu or crab fried rice ($10).  More love came from an order of Miang Kum ($7). Eaten like a taco, the "meat" is made from roasted coconut, prawns, pomelo, fresh herbs, and sweet palm then is placed on a mustard leaf. These were so light yet bursting with flavorful complexity. I know it's typical, but ordering Pad Thai ($12) is a must, if they can't get this one right, well they have no chance. Soi 4's version was no disappointment, the noodles were nice and springy, the stir-fried jumbo prawns were tender and combined with tofu, egg and bean sprouts, it's worth mentioning and ordering.  Of all the dishes that were tried, the Kang Kua Mu ($13) was my absolute favorite. They take pork shoulder then braise it in coconut milk, add kabocha squash, aka Japanese pumpkin, and Thai basil with a bit of tangy red curry. After a single bite I wanted to keep this one all to myself, tender and flavorful with just the right amount of heat.  Not all was perfect on our virtual trip to Thailand.  The Kana Mu Grob ($10) which is made up of Chinese broccoli and crispy pork belly with chili-garlic sauce. It's too bad that the belly was dried out and chewy. Pork belly when done right is so succulent and tender, even when it's crisped up its mouth-watering good.  We simply ate around the pork and enjoyed the broccoli which was tender inside with a slight crunchy exterior.  The Sticky Rice ($2) seemed old as it was unwrapped, the ball turned hard almost immediately. The familiar Neur Namtok ($10) or grilled skirt steak salad with fresh herbs, roasted rice, chili, and fresh lime juice, was pretty standard fare, though this version was considerably under dressed.   We let them know what we thought about the good and the not so good. I strongly feel that when there is a problem you need to let them know as soon as you can. Your helpful feedback only improves the food and service, most business owners appreciate it.   You know what they say, with competition comes innovation and Soi 4's delicious food, striking space and a full bar, I have to agree.

Imagine this, a swanky new Scottsdale restaurant that has down to earth prices, fantastic food and attentive top-notch service? Sometimes it's hard to believe that this kind of place even exists, but its no mirage, the Spotted Donkey Cantina is everything that I had hoped and more.   Starting with the service, there are details that just go to show how the owners and management are in tune with training of the staff. Everyone we encountered was pleasant, seemingly happy and genuine.   I have to tell you though, when it comes to eating at SDC, you'll be in good hands, Chef Patrick Bolls hands to be exact. His background includes years working with local chef-lebrity Robert McGrath, which has paid off in chiles. The southwestern influenced menu is well balanced with just a little bit of something for everyone. I mean who doesn't love the addictive crunch of La Canasta Corn Chips ($6)? Along side are 3 different salsas including a smoky charred tomato, a deeply flavored red chile orange and finally a tomatillo green chile salsa. All were surprisingly mild though these seemed more about flavor rather than scorching your face, that'll come later.  The "Shooters" ($8) seemed harmless enough. A chubby jalapeno pepper stuffed with cheddar cheese and bacon then encrusted with a coating of tortillas and deep fried. At fist bite your mouth is filled with a creamy spurt of hot cheese followed by the pork-tastic flavor of bacon. Then it hits you, the burn from the jalapeno is scorching but a quick dip into cilantro buttermilk sauce helped cool the flame.   If you're still trying to cool the flavor induced fire one of SDC many salad choices will do the trick. The Spotted Donkey "Chop" Salad ($12) is prepared table side with you controlling the amounts of roasted corn, cucumber, queso fresco, cilantro, warm smoked bacon, and avocado. Then tossed in a luscious jalapeno buttermilk dressing and served with crispy flour tortilla chips on the side, it cools and satisfies. Composed into tidy rows of tortilla crusted chicken breast, avocado, bacon, chopped egg and manchego cheese and dressed in chipotle vinaigrette, the dinner sized Southwest Chicken Cobb Salad ($12.50) was almost big enough to share.   The center of my universe, at least for a minute, was the char grilled Big Ol' Jack Ass Angus Burger ($11.50). This is a seriously tasty burger, topped with cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, avocado, jalapenos and horseradish mustard, fries on the side. Continuing with the meat parade, a sizzling iron skillet filled with Fajitas ($16) was placed in front of me. While you have your choice of chicken or shrimp, the idea of beef tenderloin mixed with sausage, sweet onions and tomatoes seemed like the hearty choice. Along side are the usual accompaniments like guacamole, salsa, crema and warm flour tortillas, what was unusual were how quickly I scarfed these down, delicious.   While the space feels decidedly modern and upscale there wasn't one moment where I felt uncomfortable or out of place, even with burger juices running down my face.

The pizza is chewy and thick.. the toppings fresh and tasty.. the beer is ice cold and they have a few on tap from SanTan Brewery.. what better place to hang out after a shopping trip to Target?!   Short, sweet and to the point! Hows that for a Yelp review?

3 years ago Chef Johnny Chu set out to bring a hot pot restaurant to the Valley of the Sun. If you're unfamiliar with Chef Chu he's the proprietor of the hip and popular downtown Phoenix Asian tapas joint Sens. Now his dream is realized with the opening of Tien Wong Hot Pot.   Surprisingly his new restaurant isn't even located in downtown Phoenix, but in the city of Chandler. After talking with Chef Chu on my last visit he explained to me that this location was selected to prove out his concept, in an Asian neighborhood. Low rent and a discerning customer base, he can make all the necessary tweaks for success and will hopefully bring Tien Wong to downtown in the future.  For many the whole hot pot experience might be foreign since many of us are used to having our food cooked for us, forget that. The idea of hot pot while romantic and interactive, is all about you cooking various meats and vegetables in hot pots filled with flavored broths. Each table is equipped with a high powered induction burner where you hot pot is placed, and then you order as many different raw meats, seafood, vegetables and noodles as you desire.   Once our order started showing up I become overwhelmed and confused, where do you start? What are the cooking times? What do I do? Before allowing my head to explode, I simply took a breather and one of the helpful staff to my aid. In my calamity I didn't notice the helpful hints on the welcome card. However it goes something like this, the broth boils, you drop in the thinly sliced meats, pull out, dip into one of 2 sauces, sesame and soy, then eat, easy. After only a few minutes of practice it all came together into a well crafted experience that's designed for socializing, romance and lingering.   If you have difficulty choosing your broth, opt for the Ying Yang Broth ($5.95) which includes both the house original herbal broth and the house spicy broth with the later being the most complex of the flavors I've tried. Starting with pork stock, the addition of dried dates, ginseng, Schezuan peppercorns and dried chiles give the base heat and depth. Over the course of your evening the broth evaporates with cooking which adds to the intensity and enjoyment.  Not to be confused with the tips of peas, Pea Tips ($4) actually are the leaves and stems surrounding the pea itself. The tips cook fast and have both crunchy and tender qualities that taste so good either cooked or raw. By contrast the Korean Pumpkin ($3) takes longer to cook but the payoff is so tender you can even eat the thin skin.  Noodles include springy Udon ($3) as well as a Flat Rice Noodle ($3) which resemble chewy flat pieces of rice than a noodle in the traditional sense. Both cook up in a hurry and their absorbent properties are capable for taking in so much flavor.   Sliced Wagyu Beef ($8) comes from one of the best breeds of cattle in the world. So its no surprise that the meat was flavorful and tender. Add an order of Lobster ($9), if available, for a surf and turf combo. Names aren't always accurate descriptions, take Sliced Black Pork ($4) which isn't black at all, the name refers to the pigs breed since it has black hair and skin. It's super tender and flavorful only taking a few seconds to cook thanks to expert slicing.   Desserts feature 2 different kind of cheesecake, Strawberry ($6) and Green Tea ($6), both were light and satisfying, the perfect ending to Chef Chu's dream.

I cant believe I haven't written about Secret Pizza before. Located in the ultra-douchy Cosmopolitan Hotel (way more than a little bit of wrong), 3rd floor in between Blue Ribbon and Jaleo. Trust me, late nights this place is far from a secret as the line will stretch all the way from the counter down a really long hallway that's adorned with record covers. Naturally said line will be filled with drunken loud mouth assholes, ignore them and keep your eye on the prize and you shall me rewarded with greatness.   The service is kind of rude but I guess I would be bitchy too if I were dealing with stupid drunkards all night long. Anyways, they had Stone IPA on tap for $5, hell yeah! Now I can be a drunkard too with skunky IPA breath! Anyways you can order up huge slices of pizza from whats already on the counter or you can order a whole pie. We usually opt for the whole pie and adorn it with mozzarella, meatballs and fresh garlic, no sauce. It comes in a box, natch, but this box is super portable.. you can take your pizza to the area over by the conference rooms where there are tons of lounge spaces and not a soul around.   My gawd this pizza is amazing! The crust is perfectly chewy with just the right amount of crispiness along the edges. I love the stringy melted cheese and thick slabs of meatball in every bite. Slurping my IPA along with this killer pizza made the wait all worth while.

DOCG was pretty empty the night of our visit so when the hostess wanted to sit us at a table in the middle of the restaurant I was a little confused. We asked to sit at a banquette along the wall, way more intimate, the hostess obliged. However we could tell immediately that our server was pissed we were sat in her section. She was super unfriendly and snappy with me when I was trying to lighten the mood with a joke. Anyway she went to another server at the register and I could clearly see she was bitching up a storm about us and then she disappeared never seeing her again. A while later the server she was bitching at arrived at our table and took our order but was very short with us and not at all friendly.  The food was very good.. shared a arugula salad, chefs choice charcuterie, fried olives and 2 pizzas, the DOCG (the egg was perfectly yolky) and the sausage and broccoli rabe (smelled like burning 420 but tasted even better). Honestly the good eats did not compensate for the bitchy service we received. I mean seriously for a place at this price point and supposed high level of service this pretty much irked the hell out of me.

Have you ever heard of a salad that is so popular that it has its own Facebook page? I know I couldn't believe it either, but this isn't any ordinary salad. Think tidy rows of smoked salmon, Israeli couscous, asiago cheese, arugula, sweet dried corn, black currants and pepitas (toasted pumpkin seeds) topped with a creamy pesto dressing all tossed table-side. The Stetson Chopped Salad should not only have its own fan page but its creator, Chef Bernie Kantak, should be given a hug every time you see him at his new Citizen Public House.   Located in what used to be the valleys original Trader Vic's, there isn't a tiki torch in sight. Instead you'll find a contemporary space outfitted with wood accents, leather booths and a stainless steel-topped bar. The vibe is casual and relaxed elevated by outstanding service on every one of my visits.   If you're wondering what a public house is, well simply put it's a tavern that also serves food. While they do serve some great drinks and have an excellent wine list, I'd be hard pressed to call Citizen a mere tavern. How many taverns have you ever heard of serving pork studded Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn ($5)? Or how about a pot filled with creamy 'Kilt Lifter' Fondue ($9) savory hunter's sausage, sweet tangy pears and toasted country bread? If you have, please let me know right away.  For dinner I couldn't recommend The Original Chopped Salad ($12) more but if you don't like smoked salmon, they can make it with chicken instead. The Mirliton Chopped Salad ($12), a composition including chayote, snow pea greens, tomatoes, popcorn, grilled halloumi cheese; cucumber-onion salad tossed with a tangy parsley-garlic dressing was a fantastic textural explosion but lives in the shadow of its older sibling.  I'm not even sure where to start with the entrees; I guess it comes down to price point. Take the lower priced lusciously juicy Lamb Burger ($12) topped with a cucumber salad, zesty tzatziki and served with fries, you'd think with flavor and quality like this would be much more expensive.   At the other end of the price range sit the fantastically meaty Fair Trade Coffee Charred Short Ribs ($28) complete with a side of brightly sour dried cherry bbq sauce and roasted parsnip puree. Somewhere in between is the juicy "Smart" Chicken ($18) which refers to the brand not the chicken's admission into the Mensa Society.   Desserts by Tracy Dempsey were all that and a bag of cookies, literally. Cookies and Milk ($6) were delightfully chewy and come served in a sealed pouch for freshness, of course the milk was ice cold just perfect for dunking. Three words, Strawberry Pound Cake ($9). A thick slice of strawberry olive oil pound cake is lightly grilled then served with vanilla malted ice cream, chocolate sauce and malted strawberry streusel and like the Stetson salad it was Facebook worthy.

The new 8,800-square-foot Eddie V's at Scottsdale Quarter includes three separate private dining rooms, in addition to the main dining areas, each with its own unique personality.  One room is dramatically situated in a round rotunda, where my partner and I had a wonderfully romantic dinner. Soft live jazz music played softly in the background while we enjoyed a cross section of delightful menu items.  Dinner was truly memorable with a starter of Tuna Tartare. Beautiful sashimi quality tuna was set an top of diced mango then topped with just the slightest amount of sliced chile. The heat was mild and only helped to accentuate the sweetness of the fish and mango. This was followed up by a gorgeous long plate filled with a mix of lightly dusted flash fried calamari, julienne carrots and daikon drizzled with a sweet soy glaze. My entree was on the lighter side but was heavy on flavor. Crab Stuffed Shrimp were excellent; extra large shrimp were grilled then topped with sweet crab meat, panko bread crumbs and a lime finish. I couldn't stop eating there plump crustaceans. I did however stop long enough to try my partners perfectly tender Steak au Poivre.  Dessert was a new take on an old classic, Bananas Foster Cake. As our waiter dumped brandy on top of the cake and set it on fire, even head in the dining room was on us, was quite a sight. The cake was the best finish to a extraordinary evening of food and romance.

Over the past few years we've been fortunate enough to have so many tasty and diverse Asian restaurants open. Some of my personal favorites are Soi4 for up-scaled Thai street food, Northeaster Thailand delights at Thai-E and chewy hand pulled noodles at China Magic Noodle House just to name a few. Now there is one more specialty to add to the fold, Sekong by Night specializing in Cambodian fare.  Sekong has taken home to the old Fellini's Pizza space at 13th Place and Indian School. They've taken the space and turned it into a charming dining room that's comfortable and tasteful. Cambodian artwork graces each table along with beautiful patterned table cloths. Family owned son Yutheana In runs the front of the house while his mom Lakhana In cooks all of the delicious Khmer style dishes.  You'll quickly notice that many of the dishes might appear like Thai food, well reverse that, Thai food is heavily influenced by Cambodian cooking though the later is definitely not as spicy. However you'll also notice a Colonial and Vietnamese influence on the menu starting with their fresh Spring Rolls. Chewy rice paper is wrapped around a salad of vegetables and shrimp, complete with a delicately sweet flavored fish sauce.  If you've ever heard of Banh Mi you'll know this famous Vietnamese style sandwich. Its Cambodia cousin called Num Pang, though simply labeled as "sandwiches" on the menu, is just as tasty. They take a large slab of crust French baguette, sourced from Lee's Sandwiches in Chandler, and pile it high with lemon grass flavored beef, pickled veggies, cilantro and a squirt of siracha chile sauce. I think once word gets out how good Sekong's sandwiches are; there could be a line out the door.  Other hits included sweetened stir fried beef Lok Lak Beef and another dish called Loat Cha. The earthworm shaped rice noodles were so chewy and addictive Id order them every time.  Service was on the slow side since they've only just opened but I assure you, it was worth the wait.

In most major cities smoking indoors in a huge nono. Though Vegas has its own set of rules and smoking is permitted indoors, Im guessing because of the gambling. Im not antismoking Im just anti red itchy eyes and congested lungs. Anyways because of this I generally don't go to bars and such where smoking is permitted.  The Garage has an awesome ventilation system. I can hang out here for hours slurping beers, playing shuffle board and having a great time. They've an awesome happy hour (2-1), are super friendly and overall have a cool neighborhood vibe. Plus they're next to the Sketchers outlet ya know, if you need shoes or something between drinks.

Stopped by Friday night with a gang of friends for dinner.. was amazed how friendly the manger was, she greeted everyone who came in through the door. This location used to be a KFC so its bright, clean and relaxed.   We ordered up a whole mess of food, ribs, brisket, sausage and a bunch of sides. The meats were pretty good though you could taste they had been hanging out for a while. You see their on site smoker isn't up and running yet so the Indian School location is supplying #2 with smoked meats. Beans and tater salad were tasty as well as their house sauce. The sweet potato fries which had a coating of cinnamon and brown sugar, killer.   Kitchen was slow but since there were only 2 people running the show and they had only been open for 4 days we cut them some slack. Though location #1 has never been known for its fast service either. Somethings done right just take a little time.   Hopefully within the next few weeks they get the kinks worked out, smoker up and running and maybe a few more hands in the kitchen. Looking forward to getting back soon.

If there was one thing I could come back here for it would be the Issan Sausage. Served as meal in itself you get a plate full of bright tasting porky goodness that's so good it's hard to deny its awesomeness. Along side is enough onion to gag your date. So if you plan on getting some later, skip the onion.

As some of you might know Ive been searching for the best barbershop in Vegas since moving here last spring. Well Im pretty sure I found it.   It was a Sunday afternoon and I was going to try Gerardo's one more time but ended up they were closed. The led display said they had another location at Decatur and Sahara so headed up there with hopes they had later hours. Well I never did find the other Gerardo's location but accidentally stumbled on Gq and the sign says open till 7pm, hooray!   The vibe in Gq is hip-hop with a touch of school barber that made me think I was in the right place. While I didn't have an appointment I was sat right away and my barber started the consultation. He made suggestions about how to cut my hair, shape my beard etc.. with quiet and steadfast execution I got one of the most precise fades and beard trims Ive had in Vegas. Completely awesome! I felt like a new man walking out of there and ya know what, both the haircut and beard trim were $25.   BRING CASH! They have a cash only policy! Also if F bombs offend you this might not be a place you'd want to check out. The banter between the barbers was pretty funny though some might find it offensive.   If you're looking for an awesome fade, cut, beard and mustache trim Gq has the goods to make you feel like a shiny new penny.

Yesterday I got another haircut and this time had a shave and beard trim as well (see pic).. you know Gq just keeps getting better. It was the most relaxing time having my face shaved by someone who knows exactly what they were doing. When he was done I was floored how awesome I looked. If you want to feel awesome about yourself just get a haircut from Gq, they f-ing rock!

Avalanche was my first foray into the shaved ice phenomenon sweeping Vegas. Let me tell you what, I totally get it. Ice shaved to the point of being fluffy covered with your choice of flavored syrups, hell yeah talk about light and refreshing. I went as far as adding a scoop of vanilla ice cream (they serve Thrifty) to my ice, what a great addition. I then added orange and vanilla syrup for what tasted just like a orange creamsicle, seriously it was a fuck yeah moment.  Next time Im totally going for the sweetened condensed milk topping cause creaminess rocks!

Having been a Pinkberry fan for years I was so excited when I heard that finally a location was going to be opening in Vegas, yay!   I couldn't wait to have my standard Pinkberry cup! This cup is composed of original Pinkberry topped with fresh banana, mochi and Fruity Pebbles. Seriously this is like the best cup of froyo ever! So when I started to order my beloved they told me they do not use Fruity Pebbles. You have to be fucking kidding me right? Nope. They have some no high fructose initiative so Fruity Pebbles were removed from the toppings months ago. Im still reeling from this completely and total let down. I begrudgingly ordered my cup sans the Fruity Pebbles and then proceeded to stand there for 5 minutes while my cup disappeared into the back so they could figured out how to cut a banana. When my cup finally emerged from the back and presented to me it was needless to say half melted. No apology, no excuses, nothing. Of course I call out bullshit when I see and asked what they were going to do since my froyo was melted, she just shrugged me off and started helping another customer out. So not only did I not get my Pebbles but I also didn't get that icy crunch that separates Pinkberry from other froyo places. What an annoying and frustrating experience after which Id be hard pressed to return.   Lesson here.. if you want Fruity Pebbles bring your own. If you want fresh banana ask for it before they dispense the froyo. Otherwise go to Yogurtland where you have control of your final froyo destiny including high fructose spike cereals.

I can sort of understand why Honey Salt is so popular, its an upscale yet casual place which Vegas is seriously lacking off strip. While I commend the owners independent spirit, my problem with Honey Salt is that it just wasn't very good. Spending over $300 (with tax and tip) for a party of four we'd expect to have an amazing meal to brag about and believe me I love talking about great experiences.   To start we'd never been to Honey Salt before so we asked to be walked through the menu, the concepts and what Honey Salt is all about. Our waiter seemed nervous and was quite scattered in his explanations.  He was attentive through out our meal, as well as his assistant, he never really relaxed around us.   Here is the run down on the food me and the Mr shared (laundry list style)..  Steak Tartare was the best dish from what the Mr and I ordered. Nice portion size but suffered from being under seasoned. I mean you'd think a restaurant that has the word salt in the name would at the very least use it.  My Wife's Favorite Salad sounded great but there wasn't a single piece of arugula on the plate, just tons of fris√©e. Meanwhile the duck tasted kind of off, not that it was bad, just tasted like it had been in the fridge to long. Im super sensitive to that flavor and usually send it back but the Mr said it fine.   Margherita Pizza had a great crust.. crispy and light while remaining chewy and toothsome this was pretty good. Again great ingredients but lacked seasoning, namely salt!   Mary's Free Range Brick Oven Chicken was sort of my fault. I had read so many great things about it so I may have had to high of expectations. So when the plate was put in front of me my expectation turned to disappointment. When you order a chicken off the menu and it costs $23 you'd expect more than a single breast. I guess I should have looked at the pics first. Then further disappointment struck when I tasted it, no fucking salt! The skin was not crisp nor the flesh tender and moist. For me this was the most disappointing dish of them all.   Cookie plate was for dessert and all 3 cookies were moist and chewy. My favorite was the brown butter chocolate chip cookie. Lots of chocolate and had that light cookie crunch connected to a chewy center, just needed and ice cold glass of milk and I would have been in a cookie coma!   I know Im in the minority with my review of Honey Salt and I hope to return one day to see if we have a different experience but it'll be a while.

Okay so 11pm on a Friday night and this place was pretty much empty. In fact when we were checking in we told them we had a reservation and they laughed at us. True it was comical, here you have this massive graffitied out cave of a space with old school metal (Ozzy, etc) blaring over the loudspeakers and we're kind of the only table in there. Since being only open for a few weeks maybe word has gotten out that they're open. Though for Vegas it seems kind of weird. Service was friendly though really green (didn't know her beers very well and for a place thats a lot about beer thats no good) but again they are new.   But the burgers, let me tell you what, those were fucking awesome! Seriously! I had the old school with LTO extra patty and american cheese slathered in thousand island dressing.. its like In N Out on steroids! The fries were pretty average which was lame cause a great burger deserves great fries. If you get a chance order the pork donut appetizer, do it! Sweet, porky, fabulously greasy fried awesomeness!   Also in case you were wondering the servers and bartenders here are sexy as hell!

112 degrees outside and I generally don't run my air conditioning in my car except for guests. I finally get to the UPS store on my way home to ship exchange yet another Chrome messenger bag (they're awesome, I'm just picky). As I'm standing at the counter filling out the shipping information I here a mans voice behind me.. "can I get you some water, or a soda pop? You look like you could use it".. as I swung around there is one of the most hunky daddies Ive seen in ages! Cropped short hair and shadow beard, tan, furry and had the most devastatingly piercing blue eyes. As I composed myself (yes, I had the vapors) and smiled back I couldn't help but think about his hot body all over...... well never mind!   Super mega friendly service with smile.. as soon as I got home I was trying to think of anything else I could ship somewhere, anywhere just to see him again. Woof!  You know where my mind is at this morning!
