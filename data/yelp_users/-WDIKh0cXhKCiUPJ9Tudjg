The Botanical Gardens is not for everyone. But for those that enjoy seeing nature in a perfect setting, it is well worth the trip.  We have been during the butterfly exhibit, and loved the place. Relaxing and quiet, it brings out my "quiet" side!  We also attended during the glass exhibit and were not disappointed. An incredible display of work. Truly a connection between nature and man!

Four stars? Seriously!  Today that is a yes. Actually I was expecting far worse. I have been going to Dr. Drury for more than 12 years, and almost every time I have been kept waiting, sometimes for more than 45 min.   Today however was different.  Today they get 4 stars. (It would be 5 but for my past experience.)   The waiting room, as always, was packed. But we moved quickly.  I was there for an annual physical, but I also was able to talk them into doing my bloodwork at the same time. In house lab rocks!  I hate needles but Jen (?) was great at calming me down, and getting it done.  And Dr. Michael Drury was his normal quiet professional self.   So congrats today for being the medical profession we ask for.

My comment is directed at Bank of America in general. I had been banking with them for 15 years, with substantial lines of credit. Of course when times are good, they are your best friend.  But when times are tough, they dump you like a bad case of the flu!  I know noone will care about this review! We all know the banks in general dont give a hoot about their clients. But at least I will feel better.  Of course, that was years ago, and now I am getting back to maklng money - and now I have banks knocking at the door.  But I will always remember the treatment they gave - cutting credit lines, closing accounts and suspending credit. All the while while the feds bail them out!  So screw you Bank of America!

I have been going to Handlebar J's for about 15 years. I have got to know Ray Herndon and the family pretty well over the years.  I took a look at the other reviews. First, I got to say, if you are expecting this place to be some hip "Snottsdale" hang-out, you will be disappointed!  Its a country bar/eatery. I have always loved the band, and the music they play. But thats what this is. You come here to drink, dance and maybe eat a little.  The food is what you expect, its good but its not Maestros, and nor do they care.  Yes, Mama can be a little tough, but hey, its her place and her rules.  They do have a two drink requirement. I think thats fair. I have seen people show up, order a drink, and spend the night nursing it. Seriously! You gotta be prepared to pay for the place, the music and the atmosphere, and two drinks is nothing!  As for the tables, they have a right to expect people sitting at tables to either drink, eat or stand up! This is not your home barbecue!  Finally, if you are in the forties plus, this is a great place for pickups. No, its not for twenty somethings, and again, its a country saloon.   I dont dance worth a damm, but there is often the "barfly" resident cowboy that is able to dance, just waiting for the girls to come in. Not my thing, but people love it.  This place is a part of the Scottdale heritage! Heck, I am told back twenty years people rode their horses up to the bar. I even heard a friend rode hers INTO the bar.  Enjoy it and say hi to Ray!

I was around when SGC first started talking about building a state of the art gun range and retail outlet. To be honest, I was skeptical the market could handle an upmarket gun store. I have been shooting competitively my entire life, and currently shoot three to four times a week in organized matches.  So I was, and am still thrilled at the success of the Club. Their prices are not unreasonable, considering the location, and their staff are great. I have taken their Concealed Carry Course with Attorney Tim Forschey. He is in a word, awesome! This is my fifth CCW course (I repeat them to stay up to date with changes in the law) and to be honest, the legal side is a little boring. But Tim is great, making it both interesting, as well as practical. I have also shot at their indoor range, and its a great facility. I have heard people say not all their staff are helpful. I guess all businesses have that, but I know many of the their people, and the ones I deal with are experts in their field.

I have always had an issue about my teeth. Terrified of the drill, and just the thought of going makes me sweat. Then I met Dr. Miller. Actually I was introduced to him by a staff member, who had been to him. He promised I would be okay! Well, it still took about 6 months, but eventually the day came - you know, the toothache, and I made an appointment,  The staff were great - and I say that with total honesty. From the moment I walked in, I felt at ease. I have been back for additional work, including a very complex bridge, and cleanings.  My dental work has been great, and I am thrilled with the results.

I have reviewed this dentist previously, but I wanted to update.  Here I am 10 months later, and I could not be happier. I have been in for at least three cleanings, and two checkups.   Each time, both Dr. Kelly as well as the hygienist, Jennifer, have been nothing but awesome.  The office manager is also great at explaining charges and fees, something few doctors ever bother to do.   A few weeks ago, my mother in law had an emergency, and went to see her own (another) dentist. My wife called me from there to say they wanted to do surgery immediately! Mmm, I told her to take her to see my dentist for a second opinion.   Dr. Kelly took one look at her, and sent to the ER, saying this was not a situation a dentist should be working with. She spent three days in the ER.  Now that is why I trust them - Honest and to the point! That's what we expect from our healthcare providers.  If you are looking for a top notch dentist, who actually cares!  I will be with them for life!

This is without a doubt the greatest reloading equipment supplier in the world. Have been using their shooting equipment for more than 20 years, and they are unparalleled. Little expensive (which is why 4 stars) but their no nonsense guarantee is the best.

We have lived up here for years, and have eaten and had takeout/delivery. I really enjoy their food, but the happy staff that work there are the best. Today, great smile, willing to change order without whining, and good attitude. Thats what I call customer service!

Tonto Bar & Grill has been a place I have frequented many times. I have taken clients there, out of town visitors and my wife! The food is always excellent. And the view of the golf course is just breathtaking.   But last week I decided on a whim to grab dinner there, as my family was away, and I was driving by. As I was on my own, I decided to sit at the bar.  Wow! What a great evening. Met the barkeeper, Brittany, as well as another couple that was eating there. It felt like I was with family. Despite the fact that Brittany was serving us, as well as all the other waiters, she still found time to chat, and keep us amused.   The fillet was, as to be expected, awesome! And the evening went by like a flash.  I eat out a lot, as I travel all the time. I will be eating there more often in the future.

My 3 year daughter had been attending Montessori for about a year.  But her favorite attraction is not the playground or the kids; it is the goat and horse.   Of course, she loves Miss Lauren, who is a wonderful teacher and loves the kids. And believe me, as someone who teaches for a living, I am really fussy!  Owners Roy and Cathy take a personal interest in every one of the kids.  My only issue was when we first signed up we were kind of lost. But that was soon corrected and since then I have been happy.  No drama when I have been late picking her up. And always a big smile when they say hi.   The learning is based on following by example. Classrooms are full of training aids and these actually are used. At her previous school they had great looking toys and aids, but they stayed and looked brand new. Mmmm.   Last of all I love the structure and motivation approach.   Great place.

I joined Lifetime three years ago, as a Family membership ($180 pm) a few years ago, like many, hoping I would enjoy working out. I am not a gym rat; it takes determination to walk through the doors. Sadly, during my period there I had numerous issues.  Daycare staff were untrained and just kids looking after kids. I play squash, which was one of my main reasons for signing up. Sadly, the courts in Scottsdale were never maintained, and worse, kids play sessions were scheduled on the courts which damaged them. The staff are distant and in many cases rude. They just couldn't care, but I think thats a side effect of a huge membership. On the positive side, the cafe is great and the smoothies are excellent. They also have a beautiful pool, which is great fun for kids. Their equipment is also great quality. Unfortunately when they raised their prices I decided to call it quits. Of purse, once I cancelled they wrote and offered free this and that, but I had had enough, and joined 24-hour fitness instead.

We love this place.  Great Wasabi beef sandwich.   And the smoothies are awesome.   We drive out of our way to come here on a Sunday when we are shooting at Rio.   The best is a great attitude and happy smile when you walk in.

In short, terrible customer service, great sales department and VERY VERY expensive mistake.  I have a small business, est 1998, 25 employees, about 3,000 clients a year. We have a small online marketing department, focused on internet promotions.   In Feb 2015 I attended an Digital Marketing conference, Traffic & Conversion, in San Diego, where I was introduced to Infusionsoft. To say I was impressed is an understatement. They came with amazing stories, client references, personal recommendations from Ryan Deiss (an internet marketing guru). But it was expensive, so I held off.  Then I attended their ICON2015 conference in Phoenix, and again got the sales talk.  In March 2015, I enrolled, paid out a couple of thousand dollars, and started re-training my staff. Not just the marketing staff, but all my employees, on the upgrade to a "better" online based CRM and how to effectively use emails and other tools. Then came the problems. First, Infusionsoft could not import our database of 12,000 clients. Issues with fields, platform, etc. I had to hire a programmer to convert our data. Then I discovered that many of the features required additional apps, which cost more.  Implementation turned into a nightmare.  We were spending hours everyday, for weeks, trying to get things working. I started complaining about it being too complicated. I was told I should hire a full-time specialist ($50-60K/yr), or attend 'Infusionsoft University" which is another $7,000.  When I tried to cancel, they referred me to a specialist firm, Think Automate Grow.  It started well, and after a few days over two weeks working with them, I was encouraged. Sadly, they too just upped and left - I was initially told they were busy. After three weeks of nothing happening, I contacted my Infusionsoft people, and told them I (again) wanted to cancel, as nothing had been implemented yet.  In July I complained again, and again, a supervisor "R" REDACTED of ThinkAutomateGrow contacted me.  Offered his apologies: "Thank you for taking my call today.  I am very sorry about the experience you have had across the board.  I would very much like to help you be successful in the future.  I have also sent over my recommendations to "A" (REDACTED) and I am hopeful that will help with what you are asking for today.  I also sent a timeline of events to Digital Marketer so they are aware that you are 100% Infusionsoft's customer and not directly our customer.  When you contacted Digital Marketer, they contacted me directly."  I quote because one of the tactics used by these guys is to constantly switch handlers, so you keep thinking something is being done.  In August 2015, yes, you read that right, FIVE MONTHS LATER, I finally had had enough. I asked them to stop charging my credit card, and to cancel my account. Yes, they tried again to switch me to someone else, but after many thousands of dollars, I had had enough.  I requested a refund of 80% of the fees paid.  They agreed, but as of September 8th, 2015, not a dollar has been refunded. I should mention I think digital marketing is important. I still think using someone such as IS is needed, as are many of the other partner companies, CustomerHub, Digital Marketing, etc.   But they need to take better care of their clients, and inform prospective small businesses of the risks and the need for experienced implementation. The upfront costs of $2,000-$5,000 are a drop compared to what it will eventually cost.   I don't often write negative reviews on YELP. As a business owner, I rely on good reviews, and understand the damage a bad review can cause. I have given Infusionsoft multiple opportunities (and months) to fix this. I think their focus on selling new clients, and hope the unhappy ones will eventually go away.  If you're wondering how many clients we signed as a result of this! How many emails did we send out? How much revenue did we generate?  The answer is ZERO. ZERO clients, and ZERO emails. Our database conversion was never completed. Input forms were never done. I believe our costs in time and cash paid out to be around $18,000.  The funny part in this, just today, I received another email from them asking me to return.

Wow, what an amazing place! Had family in town, and wanted to do something different. A friend suggested the MIM. Knowing a co-worker takes her kids all the time, I thought I would give it a try!  Initially I was a little hesitant. It is expensive, and besides, how many musical instruments can you see, right!  Well, I was stunned. Three hours and we barely scratched the surface.  We also attended a small concert, in the auditorium. Great sound; wonderful atmosphere and excellent music.  In all, a great evening!  We will be attending more of their concerts for sure!

I have always loved going to the movies.  But since they started dinner theaters, this is my ideal entertainment.  You walk in, sit down, pull up a table, and order drinks and food.   With a young child, I can feed her, while enjoying the movie. Most times, if I order just right, I can keep her eating throughout the movie. Generally we attend the Studio Movie Grill on Hayden, but recently a friend suggested trying iPic at Scottsdale Quarter.  I booked (always a good idea) Chose the upgraded seating.  Imagine my surprise when I showed up at the theatre, and find I need to order and wait for my food "outside" and then carry it into the theatre.  What? I cannot sit down and order from inside the theatre? Nope, thats only for the upgraded seats. Mmm, I thought I had done that. But no, there are three (?) levels of seating.  So my family and I order, and wait for our food. In the meantime the movie starts. Did I mention the food was substantially more expensive than anywhere else, but of course this is the "Quarter".  The movie was great, and the seats comfortable, but I wont be back.  And yes, I told my friend he needs to look into other places.
