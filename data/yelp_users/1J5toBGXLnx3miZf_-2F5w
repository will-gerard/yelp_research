The thoroughness of their prenatal care saved my baby's life. My first pregnancy was perfect with no problems, but my second pregnancy... not so much. I went in for my 18 week anatomy ultrasound, and as part of that exam they screened me for incompetent cervix (which many practices don't do). It turns out I had incompetent cervix and was well on my way to losing the baby. Most women don't learn that they have this condition until after they have lost their baby. Because of their diligence, I was able to take the necessary steps to save my baby.  The quality of the care at SWCWC is unparalleled. I highly recommend this practice.

I brought my car here after a road trip, so my ride was looking pretty nasty with all manner of bug guts. I asked them what kind of car wash I would need to scrape off all the goo, and they said I'd be all set with the basic $8 wash. While they washed my car I walked next door to IHOP and got breakfast; by the time I was done eating my car was all set to go. The bug juice was gone and my car looked great! I was appreciative that they didn't try to sell me a fancier car wash than I needed to get the job done. I feel it was $8 well spent, and my car wash + breakfast combo will now be a post-road trip tradition.

My husband and I went to the ER and waited 3 hours before taken back to one of those little curtain areas with a recliner in it.  The room was clearly meant for only two people, but they had squeezed three patients in there.  As a result, the nurse didn't have adequate room to work in.  She was using the floor as a table as she placed my husband's IV.  She even placed "sterile" gauze on the floor before using it to cover up the IV site.  I was absolutely disgusted.  The nurse also placed my husband's used IV needle on the floor, leaving blood on the floor that never got cleaned up.  I wonder how many other people's blood was on the floor before the sterile gauze pad.  We waited an additional three hours without seeing a doctor, during which time my husband was feeling worse and worse.  We finally told the nurse that we needed to either see a doctor in the next half hour or we were going to leave.  The nurse came back 25 minutes later and told us that she had just gotten the okay to process our discharge paperwork.  We left 6.5 hours after we got there and never saw a doctor.  Here's the kicker: we got a bill today for over $4k.  I strongly recommend against this ER.  I have a friend who went there and waited 12.5 hours before seeing a doctor.  Go to Banner Desert - I have been to the ER there and only waited 20 minutes.

This is by far my favorite Thai food restaurant.  Great prices and AWESOME food.  I have yet to order something here that I don't like.  I highly recommend the Pad See Ew with fried tofu... I have DREAMS about that dish.  Love this place!

Doc and Eddy's has a great atmosphere, where you can hang out with people from all walks of life.  Scottsdale snobs need not apply!  You can show up in a jeans and t-shirt and fit right in.  An evening can be spent watching UFC, playing pool and air hockey, chatting with the regulars, or chilling on the patio.  There's a little something for everyone, and you can be yourself.  The food is good and reasonably priced, and the same can be said of the drinks.  You won't find your eyes bulging out of your head when you see the bill at the end of the night, so you can just relax and order "one more" without being totally stressed about how much it's costing you!  Recently the bar and the bathrooms have been revamped, so Doc's is now seeming less like a dive bar, though the atmosphere still  isn't high maintenance.  You won't be pestered by gold-diggers or popped-collar douche bags trying to get into your pants...  just way cool people looking to make friends.  I highly recommend.

Fantastic! I had the chicken fried chicken and chicken noodle soup, topped off with chocolate peanut butter mousse pie. Everything was superb. Prices were excellent; I would have paid more and am thrilled that I got to pay less. Try this place, you won't regret it.

High quality sushi at great prices!  The sushi always seems fresh, and they have great lunch specials.  We brought our Japanese friend here when she visited, and she was very impressed with the quality of the sushi.  I wish I could eat here 5 days a week.

Sunguard recently painted my house down in Chandler after I bought a coupon from Angie's List. My house was over the allowed size for the coupon, but Walt worked with me on the pricing and I really feel like I got a great price.  Walt came out and did and estimate on my house right away, and then I waited to get approval to paint from my HOA. Once I did, I called Sunguard and they came out that same week to paint my house. Once they started, the whole prep and painting process took two days, which was a lot less time than I was expecting.  The painters who came were all very friendly and professional, and the work they did was excellent. They patched and repaired all the stucco and some trim pieces that the previous owner's dog had chewed to a pulp. They removed the light fixtures out front (at my request) since I was planning to replace them after they were done painting. They taped off all the windows and doors, and were very careful not to slop paint everywhere. The color scheme I chose had three different colors, and the lines between the colors are clean and crisp.  I am really impressed with the quality of the work, especially at the price. When it comes time to paint the interior of my house, I'll be calling them again.

I went here for dinner last night with four other people. I got two sushi rolls (spicy tuna and spicy yellowtail), and we shared the chicken fried rice.   Sushi: Middle of the line. I felt like it was a little bit pricey for what I got. Next time I will make sure we go during happy hour for sushi.  Fried Rice: Amazeballs. I will eat my own body weight in this rice. This rice is the new everything.   Service was friendly and the place had a nice atmosphere. It was pretty dead while we were there, which was fine since we weren't there to make new friends. The bathrooms were nice and clean.

I went here because I had a restaurant.com certificate.  Jade House added 18% gratuity after tax, which is a no-no, gratuity should always be assessed before tax.  Additionally, I resented the automatic gratuity because our server didn't earn it.  We spent most of our meal with empty water glasses, and he never asked us if everything was okay with the meal.  Our mongolian beef tasted like wet paint, and sesame chicken tasted like pork rinds.  Would NEVER eat here again.  I honestly am baffled by all the positive reviews for this restaurant... I feel like we are talking about two different places!

The noodles here are spectacular! I have never been able to deviate from the chicken stir fry with noodles because I love it. You can watch them make the noodles on site, which is a great way to entertain my kids while we wait for our food. On several occasions, I have also purchased noodles to take and stir fry at home. You can get an order of plain noodles for about $3, which I think is fair.

A coworker just brought these in today as a treat for the rest of us; I have never had these donuts before.  They are amazing!  I will definitely be driving out of my way to partake in the doughy deliciousness again.  I can't say anything about the physical restaurant or anything, because I wasn't there... but I can vouch for the product.  Absolutely delicious!

I have only been here once for lunch, and I got their Bento box with a Spicy Tuna roll and the panko chicken. I am allergic to shellfish, so I had to sub in the tuna roll, and they charged $2 extra, which I thought was a bit much, especially since the substitution was due to an allergy. The sushi was passable.  The panko chicken was awesome! I loved it so much. It had a lemon sauce on it that the server brought on the side in case I didn't like it. I actually really liked having the sauce on the side because then the chicken stayed nice and crispy (as opposed to getting soggy in the sauce).   The bento box also came with fried rice, a fried wonton, an egg roll and miso soup. Overall I thought it was a great value for what I got.  Update: I just went back yesterday and tried the bento box with Mongolian beef. The Mongolian beef was excellent.

This is one of the few dentists in my area that will take TDA dental insurance, so that is why I tried them out.  Making the appointment: I was able to get an appointment very quickly. Added bonus is that they work late on Mondays so I don't have to take time off work to go to the dentist.  Teeth cleaning: The dental hygienist, Kari (Carrie?), was great. Very gentle. She was also really great about explaining what she was doing, and why, as she was doing it. I liked that.  Dental exam: At my first appointment, they took hi-res pictures of my teeth, and the dentist took me through the pictures and explained what he was seeing. I had a cavity (not my first), and he showed me what it looked like, etc. I really liked how transparent the whole process was.  Cavity filling: Dr. Spurling filled my cavity for me, and it was a relatively quick and painless process (about an hour in the chair). I haven't had any problems with my filling since then. I should note, however, that my husband has also had a cavity filled by Dr. Spurling (his first cavity), and has since had pain. He's been back a few times trying to fix it, and so far they haven't charged him for these follow-ups.

First time to Firehouse Subs a couple of weeks ago. The sandwich was surprisingly meaty, though for the cost it seemed about right. They had cute plastic firehats for the kids--always a crowd pleaser. It did take a while to get my sandwich--I'll give them a pass though because it was during the lunch rush.

I never knew a donut could try too hard until I tried these. Too many things going on in a single donut, and they were overly syrupy sweet and sticky. I think maybe they were going for artisanal or quirky--trying to tap into the designer cupcake fad? Whatever they're doing though, it just doesn't work. I'll not be returning.

This Water & Ice is one of the biggest in terms of square footage that I have ever been into. I got a craving for some Thrifty ice cream, and called ahead to make sure they had my favorite flavor on hand (which they did; peanut butter and chocolate).   When I got there, I was impressed by the vast array of cold treats they had available. Two large cases of Thrifty ice cream, plus shaved ice, and a good variety of Icee-type drinks.   They also had a wide selection of novelty candies and sodas--this place is a kid's dream. There was a nice little seating area with some arcade games to use while you enjoyed your treats.  The staff was very friendly and helpful, too. I'm planning to be back!
