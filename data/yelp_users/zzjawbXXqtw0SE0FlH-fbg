I checked in for a blood test with Theranos.  Very happy with Theranos.  Good staff that painlessly took blood for a lab test.

I work about a mile down the road and it is our regular.  Many of my co workers are finicky eaters, but all agree it is consistently the best greek food.  They are always busy and efficient.  Of course large portions, and you can watch as they prepare the food so freshness is never an issure.

Above scale BBQ.  The atmosphere is more upscale than the typical cowboy BBQ restaurants.  This is refreshing.  Prices are very fair with extra large portions.  My wife and I easily share entres with food left to go.  Flavor is smokey in a good way.  Of course the meats are very tender from slow smoking.  The wait staff tends to be on the younger side, so may get terrific service or marginal.  Management and kitchen seem to be more consistent than the wait staff.  But, don't let this keep you from the restaurant, the food and atmosphere are tops.

Filthy.  Soap dispenser in the restroom completely broken and other dispenser empty.  I had to wonder how the employees washed their hands.

I am the only one in my family that like the "Bertos".  They are my first choice when eating alone.  This is by far the best in the city.  Menu is no different than any other berto, staff is average, leaning toward the "I am here but don't want to be here".  But, the restaurant is the cleanest Berto in the valley.  Food is consistently good, not dried out.

Very good subs.  A pleasant switch from the other sub shops.  Ordering on a bag was different the crew was very prompt to recognize my confusion and quick to explain.  On my next visit I was a pro at ordering.  I had a pizza sub and will be back for this again.  Crew was cheerful and helpful.

A couple of weeks back my daughter was in Tempe and her car overheated and her friend recommended Greasers which was within towing distance.  Temperature of over 110 in the Phoenix shade that day.  Great service, Chris stayed past closing to install a special order part.  Working great with no follow-up problems.  So, when the ac on my Avalon stopped working, I traveled the extra distance hoping for another good experience.  I had good results again, they took the care in the morning and out that afternoon.  No problems.  Very fair price.

It is Denny's.   We all know what to expect.  This particular restaurant is the most consistent with food and service.  Have not received bad service or food here.  Often times we have received exceptional service.  Have frequented this restaurant regularly.  It is on my list of regulars.
