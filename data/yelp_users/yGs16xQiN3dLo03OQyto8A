I can offer no better review than the fact that Dr. Dedinsky has been my doctor for more than 15 years.  I highly suggest him to anyone looking for a new doctor. He is routinely listed in Phoenix magazine's "Top Docs" issue and always has surpassed my expectations.

Jeff P has it all right. I've been going to AABC for a really long time, and they've always been my favorite shop.   The owners are always up to help you, and the staff is excellent. No matter if I'm in 1 time every 6 months, or every week, Eddie always has my books pulled and he knows my box # by memory. I don't even know my box number.  I've been going to AABC exclusively for years, and I see no reason to change.  Atomic is trying too hard, and they don't care about you. Samurai is good, but not my style. They are great for indie and anime, but I'm a Marvel guy.

I've been to Coup Des Tartes several times over the years, including a great time on New Year's Eve back when they first opened. For a time they used to serve an excellent brunch on the weekends (Hangover cure #9 was my favorite) but that was short lived and deeply missed.  One thing to keep in mind when planning to eat her is that the menu is always changing with th seasons. It is also not traditional French cuisine, but French influenced takes on whatever fresh ingredients are available at the time.   Some of my favorite dishes in the past have included an excellent spinach salad with wasabi dressing, a Pork Tenderloin that was tender enough to cut with the edge of my fork, and the often reviewed lobster.  But the thing that keeps me coming back is the desserts. The tartes here are made fresh every day in the morning, and AMAZING. The Banana Brulee tarte is by far one of my favorites; with the filling texture soft and creamy but not overly sweet. The crust has always been light, flaky and a perfect contrast to the filling.  This is a great romantic place to go, small but not crowded and lit nicely. I do recommend a reservation unless you are stopping by for just dessert after a dinner elsewhere, as it can be very busy with only approx. 15 tables maximum. The staff has always been very nice, and they were even kind enough to create a custom menu for friends of mine that were engaged there (he hid the proposal in the words of the menu).

We use this place all the time for our weimaraner. Great day care, caring vets, and an awesome staff.   They know our dog by name & when we see the staff in our neighborhood they always say hello.

Completely remodeled inside in the last few weeks. Still has the odd way that you have to line up to order, and the same staff. It just looks newer/cleaner.  And its still just Subway.

I usually get the food here takeout, and have only eaten in once.  The pizza is very good, and better than what you'd get form a delivery place.  The calzones are gigantic, and well worth the calories. The white pizza is one of my favorites, but don't sleep on the red sauce pies either. The pepperoni is great, tho every once in a while it has a bit too much sauce.

I'm just reviewing this for breakfast/lunch - I've not eaten anything else here.   Although recently they've begun to be open for dinner, and the menu looks good & affordable.  Yesterday we went for lunch and I had the Pecan Cinnamon roll french toast. It was just right for what I was craving and hit the spot. One think I really liked was that they offered the option of either thin or thick cut (my choice). My breakfast was perpared great, with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of Toast, lightly dusted with powdered sugar. The sauce on the Pecan roll slices was perfectly caramelized from the french toast preparation and the syrup was just enough to add to the taste.  I also had a nice side of crispy bacon and did I mention that they serve Ovaltine?!?!?

It's called "Babeway" for a reason people...   But I go here for the Deli, they have the best panini. I like to stop in for the 3 cheese panini with mustard and tomato. It's also a good choice to pair up with the Italian wedding soup.

I've been going to Big Wong for at least a decade (even in the old location) and am very sad to hear that they are closing/closed.  Gina and the rest of the staff have always treated me like family and I can't believe that it's going to be gone.  In all that time, I have NEVER EVER had a bad dish. EVER. I've eaten practically the entire menu and visited so often when I lived closer that they would put in my appetizer order before I even got a table. Many of my friends were introduced to this place by me, and when visiting from as far away as Alaksa would ask me to go there when in town.  If they do reopen somewhere else, I'll be 1st in line for some paper wrapped chicken!

The previous review had it right by not ordering anything. Both of my stars are for the scenery and the location - nothing for the food at all.  We were here for a Easter lunch today as we wanted to go someplace out of the way and peaceful on a beautiful Easter Sunday. The restaurant is on a beautiful location in the Saguaro Lake Marina, with a great view of the lake (and the aforementioned retaining wall).   The location definitely deserves a better eatery. Our hostess was not very pleasant and seemed uninterested in our business or our reservation. The server was virtually nonexistent and also did not seem to care about the tables. We opted to sit on the patio so we could see the lake and it was a beautiful day.  A lot of the tables reminded me of a McDonald's table - molded plastic with fixed swivel chairs.  The menu SOUNDS a lot better than it actually is - and we found out why from a conversation overheard with a server and customer at another table: The food for the restaurant is all purchased at Costco. That's right, Costco. That explains the uninspired Gyro with precut strips of meat, "Greek" salad consisting of what appeared to be bagged salad with cubed feta, olives and thick italian dressing. Another selection that sounded good until the plate arrived is the Malibu Chicken sandwich: Your standard Tyson chicken breast on a roll with a slice of Oscar Mayer ham and some rubberish cheese.  Please let someone renovate this place - it could be a real gem with a good menu, solid food sourcing and a staff that cares more.

I just visited this place on Valentines day with M, and was very pleased with the experience.  I'd never even heard of the place, and when she suggested it I looked it up online, found the website and decided it was a great idea.  The food is a New Mexican menu, complete with plenty of chilies in a lot of the dishes. The atmosphere on the outside look nothing what you experience inside. The bar looks comfy, and the patio (where we sat) is nice and intimate, plenty warm with the fireplace and heaters. The service was (mostly) attentive, only lacking at the point when we needed our server towards the end of our meal.  I had the Machaca & Tomatillo Chimichanga as my main course, M had the Portales Portobello Sandwich. Both were very good. The mushroom was a perfect tenderness, not too springy or chewy. The flavors were even, and the chipotle mayo a tad too spicy for M. My Chimi was tasty, the tortilla a nice combo of crunchy on the outside and chewy inside. The Machaca was flavorful and tender with a nice accent from the tomatillo. I was also impressed with the side dishes my meal came with. The rice was tender and light, with just the right amount of  slices and cheese (not too much of either). The black bean were cooked evenly and had a heat that comes up on you well after you've taken a bite.  I liked my experience, and look forward to going back again sometime.

I wouldn't do this normally and I am a big fan of KFC Chicken strips; but this location sucks. Bad. Like really bad.  I tried to go in just today for lunch. The drive thru was packed, so I walked in. There was a line 9 people deep, and no one taking any orders. The staff seemed to be working, but no cashier?!?! Not even anyone acknowledging the line. The one person who was inside getting thier order (to go) had to get them to correct it as they gave him the wrong chicken.  It's at least the 2nd time that I've had bad luck at this KFC, and I waited 5 minutes in line then I left (still no new orders in front of me either).  Sorry KFC, you won't see me here again...

Do I really want to add to the love-fest? Yes I do.  I've been here twice, and gotten in once (the wait got me the other visit). But now that I've made it inside, I can tell you that the wait is well worth it.  M had it as simple as you can get: A single egg, scrambled. And it was light, fluffy and perfect.  I had the Honey Lemonade and wish I could have it every day.   I also had the waffle & Bacon, both were amazing. The thick cut peppery bacon is soo good. I don't eat a lot of pork; so for me to love bacon, it's a big deal.  The waffle is the best I've ever had. the exterior is perfectly golden brown, and the inside is like eating a cloud. A tasty tasty cloud.  Wait it out, it's worth it.

So I started this review over a month ago, and I still can't get the Duck Breast Tacos out of my mind.  I don't remember much else at this point, except I got the Lazy Enchiladas and they were great too. But M got the aforementioned tacos, and their tender smoky goodness haunts me.  I need to go back as soon as M gets home.

So, in order to counter the bad review of KFC I did - I'd like to thank Popeye's for being right down the street from the office. The staff here is ALWAYS good, even the drive thru. And it's always quick, unlike the toher chicken place up the street.  My standard order?   Number 5 = 5 Piece strips (spicy) with biscuit and Red Beans & Rice. Root Beer to drink.  The only thing that could make it better would be Vernors in the soda machine...

I'm just finishing up eating as I write this.  Let me start by saying that this place is tiny, and I mean TINY. 3 tables and 6 bar stools tiny. But the food is GOOD.  I had the Gyro (a usual safe bet and item to judge by) and was very happy to see the meat carved right off the spit in the kitchen.  Wrapped in a nice fresh pita, with an nice tangy tatziki that was enough to get some in every bite, but not overpowering. The gyro was topped off with some chopped lettuce (not iceburg) and to my suprize pickle halves. Yummm.The fries were cooked to order, but needed salt and un remarkable.  The menu offers breakfast all day and one of the lunch items is Beef Tongue (that Jeff wants to go try).

I was pleasantly surprised by Sauce. We went here for dinner last night, and wanted something quick, tasty and casual. Done. I think of it as a cross between a fast food place and a pizzeria.  I had the Pepperoni and Crimini Mushroom pizza, and it was great. The crust is amazingly thin yet perfect for the pie. The center where the toppings are is a nice and soft but the edges are super crispy with a chip-like "crunch". The sauce and toppings were noticeably fresh and perfectly proportioned on the pizza.  M had the Turkey salad, and she too was very pleased. I can describe hers much - as we both stuck to our plates!  The waitstaff was very pleasant and everything came out well; however nothing really blew me away to earn that 5th star.

I'm only writing this for one thing, secretly tucked into the back by the smokehouse.  I love the "soup" bar back there. I don't really know what to call it, since it's not soup, but rather the place they put the chili and BBq meats.  I think the lamb chili is just flat out superb. Tender, moist chunks of lamb and a variety of vegetables make it one of the best I've ever had. I also am a big fan of the bbq shredded beef. The flavors are rounded and even, not too sharp, hot or sweet.  The next thing I really like is the guys who work in the beer department. They are always very willing to match up a brew with the choices you've made for dinner, and even to help push your own horizons on beers. Some of my new samplings are Ol' Chub (don't be scared of the fact it comes in a can), Raisin d'etre (made with golden raisins) and Stone Vertical ale.

A great healthy dessert that actually tastes good!  I've been here twice now, and neither time was I disappointed. The flavors are true and really do taste like ice cream. So far I've had the Egg Nog and a toffee flavor, and both were delicious.  And the spoon IS gold.

My friends are gonna kill me, but I secretly love their sushi. For a quick "fresh and easy" meal, I don't think you can go wrong. Plus, the collapsing chopsticks are cool. Also the poke tuna is a good choice, i just don't eat the onions.  My favorite dish here is not available anymore sadly; they used to make an excellent wild mushroom risotto that I want again badly.  The store branded breads are good, and I've also tried the gelato & ice creams with no letdowns so far. It's not your everyday grocer by any means, but a nice place for someone to pick up the fresh ingredients that you need to add to the staples you buy at the grocery store by your home. I actually think it's funny when someone walks up front with a full shopping cart only to discover that they will be ringing themselves up. I always use the self check at the grocery store anyway, so it's amusing to me when people are too lazy to ring up their own food.

I went here on a whim last night, not knowing that it was a Vegan/vegetarian restaurant.  That being said, I was VERY impressed! The food was very fresh and tasty. I was a little apprehensive about eating the meat substitutes but came away happy.  I had the cucumber rolls and the Lemongrass soy beef delight. I was very pleased with both. The cucumber rolls were handmade right in front of my eyes, and they were beautiful, crunchy, and FRESH. The peanut sauce that they come with was also very tasty.  The LSBD was also very good, I really liked the taste and texture of the "beef"; it even had the proper looks of shaved beef. The noodles that they are served with were light, perfectly cooked and a great compliment to the rest of the dish.  I'll for sure be visiting again sometime soon!

I've been to a few other Gyms in town, but I like this one the best.  I don't know what happened with the previous review, but it's not like any experience I've had at Climbmax. I've been there many times with different people, and it's always been a good time.  They do indeed have you pass a belay/knot test before they'll let you climb on your own, but I like the fact that it's 1-on-1 rather than a video like some other gyms in town.   The routes are changed often, and so far I've always been able to be challenged yet still be encouraged enough to know that I'm still improving as a climber.  A great gym at a good price.

M & I tried this place while we were  out looking at houses this past weekend. At the minimum, we assumed that we'd get something to fill us up. Little did we know that we were in for a treat.  The Dogs are very good, with a natural casing that gets good & crispy when cooked. I went with the Boston - A regular dog on a soft, warm bun with SauerKraut & Spicy Mustard. Excellent portions & good flavors all around. M had an Original w/o onion. She was pleasantly surprised as well.  The staff were greta, and promptly took our order tableside and brought us our drinks. I assume that when that are busiest that you need to order at the counter and find a seat, but they appear to offer tabel service at the slower times.  If you're in the area, it's worth a stop in.

I have not had a single bad visit to this barbershop. The staff has been always nice, friendly, and provides a good haircut.  I usually get the Triple Play which is a cut, shampoo and hot towel. Not a bad place to go if you're looking for a new barbershop.

Just got my first service here today and couldn't be more pleased. The cut was quick & easy but very precise, and the finish with a straight razor was unexpected.   I plan on coming back for a straight razor shave, somehting I've always wanted to have done.
