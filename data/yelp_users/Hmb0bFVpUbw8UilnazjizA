I love this little coffee shop! The girls are so sweet, and know my order by heart now. I love that I never have to tell them what I want, they see me coming and start making it for me! And of course, its always perfect!   Emily and Julia are sweet girls and great at what they do! My coffee is always -perfect- every time they make it (saw that someone said in a previous comment that they were unprofessional and "too cool for school", and its totally not true!) They always have a smile for me and chit-chat a bit as they make my coffee.   Everyone that works here is good at what they do, and it shows in the excellent coffee!

Written by Husband:I had a serious issue with them quoting me cash price in contrast with what they billed my insurance. My wife and I went in here just to get a doctors note for her absence at work . She received a five minute check up and the note was promptly typed up. we were in and out in 20 minutes. When we received our bill from our insurance we see that " Doctor's Express" billed our insurance company $289.00 for the same service they quoted us for cash as $99.00. I called and I was told It was our insurance company that billed themselves $289 and that they had nothing to do with it. I have never had to pay over $120 for any urgent care visit ,including having debris removed from my eye. This place is a HUGE RIP OFF! Unless you have a flat co-pay insurance plan don not use your insurance ,it will end up costing you more than you think.  I believe the doctors there charge $900 an hour . To people like me That is outrageous for a strip mall doctors note.
