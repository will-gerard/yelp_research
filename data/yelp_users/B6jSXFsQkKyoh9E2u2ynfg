I enjoy entertainment of all kinds. I am not a prude.  I have the occasional freak out when someone runs up to me a roars...but I see it as keeping me engaged rather than annoying.  If you gravitate to the same philosophy, then you will appreciate Zumanity.  The preshow definitely serves as an appetizer for what you are about to see. Is it a woman, are those her boobs, OMG.   Yeah, it's very interactive.   I enjoy acrobatics and have seen my fair share.  I was looking forward to something new, something adult, something different.   The girls in the water were erotic. Mr. Macho was a little too feminine for me.  The duel, well I saw that one coming.   Like others have said, there is more titillation for the male species.  It's not the most daring Cirque Show, but I left entertained and happy.  I love all celebrations of love and even met a guy that was there with his dad.  Too funny, right?   The MC is perfect and the comedy borderline funny and space filler.   If you want to see some boobs and thrusts, head to the Olympic Gardens. If you want to see some daring artistry with an adult connotation from Cirque, head to Zumanity.  You never know what it could lead to next...wink wink.

Great music. Various rooms. Live Band, aka guy banging the drums real good...and I mean REAL good.  Hot Bouncers.    Hear Ye Hear Ye...calling all beat thumpers!  Tao will satisfy all your nasty dance fantasies. I enjoyed my experience at TAO.  Why? I was on a guest list and paid nothing. I waited less than 20 minutes. I was allowed to partake in an open bar for an hour. I am a girl and had no boys in my party. Although I encountered some snooty people, I was able to brush them off and keep dancing.  I didn't wait in line to see Paris Hilton, but I did enjoy seeing Kevin from The Office behind the red ropes.  I enjoyed watching the HOT PEOPLE.  Trust me, get on the list...take advantage of the people you know or have met. I learned they also get a cut when I step foot in the door.  WISH: I would love TAO more if they allowed me to soak my feet in the rose petal tubs in the front. Looks so soothing...my feet would appreciate.

This time...I relished in VIP treatment.  Table and free drinks=SCORE. Shout out to the cute Latin bouncer who had me going GA GA over a man in a suit.  I could of stood in line just to have him catch me not paying attention to his speech about where to sit and where to go. Call me, PAPI CHULO!   I definitely love the TAO staff more than any other club staff. They rock and the bouncers managing the line are HOT.

Don't believe the hype.   $16 dollars for 4 skinny pieces of salmon sashimi. Bogus. If you are going to drop dollars, don't do it here.  It may be an awesome restaurant for LA, but it didn't work for me in Las Vegas.   Reservation highly recommended.  Even then, hope for the best!  We had to wait over 30 minutes for our food, hungry. It didn't help that we saw tables seated after us getting food before us.  From what I gather, everything else that was ordered was good:  the halibut fish special, the ramen, the chicken skewers, and the sushi were delightful.  If it wouldn't of been for the the wait, you may have seen 3 stars from me.   If you are a party of 6 or more, 20% gratuity will be automatically tacked on to your bill, regardless the situation.   Luckily for us, our waiter couldn't refute the mistakes and updated our bill.  Too bad he ended up with a couple of dollars, but maybe next time....a little more communication or some chips and salsa please...well you know what I mean.   Drinks seemed appetizing, the bar staff was friendly, and the hostess was nice.   My company of 5 HOT woman made up for my meal.

Amenities, amenities, amenities, amenities, amenities, and MORE amenities.   This hotel was a pleasant surprise, seriously.  Located in the epicenter of everything Scottsdale, this resort is definitely aimed for people looking to enjoy a fabulous stay.   Rooms are clean, cozy, and spacious. They are equipped with mini fridges and mini bars. They have a Vegas style, massive pool that is equipped with plenty of beach chairs and towels.   Some of my favorites: FREE S'MORES.  Grab a kit, hijack a fire pit, and away you go!  FREE Coffee in the morning  FREE Wine tasting in the evening Bikes rentals available, and yes they are FUN.  They do have a gym, and parking is very accessible.   Cons- no elevators, although it's just 2 floors.  rooms need a little refresh, but then again, who spends lots of time in their room anyway?   Overall, I enjoyed the Firesky.  I like the off peak specials and would visit again.

You will either love it or hate it. If you love The Beatles, you probably won't  mind spending $110 to experience the music via visual interpretation.   If you are KINDA a fan, you may fall asleep.  It's not death defying acrobatics, but it is entertainment.   If you want naked people or something that will knock your socks off, head elsewhere.   Needless to say, I enjoyed myself very much. I was moved, touched, and at some points choked up. I was a little worried when I sat in my nosebleed seats.  Luckily, there is no  bad seat in the house...and the bed transformation is visible from everywhere. ACES.

Best described as an extension of the Venetian, The Palazzo is a higher end hotel with the capacity to be budget friendly.  Location Location Location!  The Palazzo is located within walking distance of The Venetian, Encore, and The Fashion Show Mall. Save on Taxi's by walking, plus.   Space Space Space! The suites are large enough to accommodate 6 women with all their bags, dresses, and shoes. 2 beds and a sofa that could sleep 2.  2 tv's in the living area and one in the bathroom.  Simple. Comfortable. Elegance.    If you have ever bunked with more than 2 girls, you know that mirror time is precious. The bathroom was ample, and the tub fit 5 pairs of feet for a well deserved Epsom salt soak.   I was pleasantly surprised.   Big groups welcome, plus.   Food Shopping Food Shopping Food Shopping and a little Gambling!  Nuff said. No reason to leave, plus?   You can stay at the Imperial Palace, or spend a little more for a luxurious room at the Palazzo. I will definitely be back!

POOL PARTY taken to an out of this world whole 'nother level. I have never been to Rehab, but from what I could gather regarding the feedback, Wet Republic it's where it's at.  Only for the beautiful and sexy people!  Where else will you EVER be able to pull off wearing heels, makeup, and bikini to a pool and worry about getting wet?  Yeah...I had to do a double take myself.  Line starts to form pretty early....as in 11AM. If you aren't VIP, you wait like everyone else.  People want to grab primo seating, so it's recommended you arrive EARLY.  Daybeds are a a grip to reserve, and even if you settle on one of the the comfy chairs by the pool, you will still get sticker shock if you don't know what you are in for.  Food and drink minimum's.  Research, or plan on sitting on the steps of the pool.  If you are a girl, WORK IT.    Drinks are great. Food snacks are even better.  Wear plenty of sunblock and apply gloss constantly.  Hats recommended, sunglasses a must. Cleavage and peck muscles...a necessity.   Wet Republic, your staff is great...and I can't believe they mistook my bare minerals for a dispenser for CRACK.  Just saying dude...I guess loaded takes on another meaning here.     ACES in LV!

Dude, this joint has a HIMALAYAN SALT WALL...THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY LICK.    Yes, let that sit with you for a second.  Strangers, lick a wall, over and over and over...and over...lick.  Supposedly, it has antibacterial properties. Still, I won't be licking the wall.    This joint is cool.  Decor is dark wood, candlelight tables, and swanky music pumping in the background. The staff is attentive.   The star of this meal:  Roast Corn Gorditas. AMAZING.  Highly recommend this trio of goodness.  However, this shouldn't be all you get.  The shaved kale salad had a kick, courtesy of the dressing. The portion is big and can easily serve 3.  Notable mentions: Cheese plate, chicken tacos, and table side Guacamole.   Props to the staff for correcting a snafu with one of our meals and being attentive. When one of our dishes came out with an "unexpected" addition, they corrected it immediately by offering us a replacement and comping dessert.    We didn't oblige, but appreciated the server and managers quick attention to rectify the situation.  Dope restaurant, and highly recommend if you are in old town Scottsdale.

No one is safe from the condescending bouncers.  A suit may make you look good, but doesn't give you the right to be an asshole.  Go to this line, no go to that line...Frick...get organized!   Is me standing here a fire violation, really?   Once you get through the maze and the $20 cover charge, you enter the quintessential world of VEGAS. Gold boobs, table service, stripper poles, and various dance floors. It's LUSH, ELEGANT, and NOT tacky. I swear all that was missing was some candy walls and glitter from the ceiling at 1AM.  It works. It's not stuffy, and the people are a good mix of dorks, rappers, and true beat thumping dancers.   You will have eye candy and those people that just make you want to look away...yes drunk girl in the bathroom who is naked, I am talking about you.  Nonetheless, this is one of my favorite clubs in Vegas.  It's entertaining and busy in a good way.  Not to be missed!   Did I mention the club is SPACIOUS.   Multiple open dance areas with plenty of ventilation make the night crawlers stay out past their bed times.    In addition, there is an outdoor area to mingle. It boasts a relaxing pool, cabanas, game tables, and for the sexy-heaters.   The pool is a nice touch.  If your feet start to ache, take a quick dip outside and JUST DANCE.   If you are walking to XS, pack some socks...the walk home at 5AM is going to be painful.  Tip: Get a cab!

Taste Great, Open Late.  Getting ready to go out on a night of partying....?  Stop here FIRST and load up on items that will soak up the alcohol later!   Lollipop Buffalo Wings, shrimp cocktails, sliders, pizza, and the "Have I told you about my wiener?" sandwich.  Add a side of fries and strong cocktail, and you are ready to party!    It's not a sports bar, but you'll probably find a game on the tube. It's not a club, but the music being pumped throughout the space truly makes you want to dance. It's not your neighborhood bar, but the staff makes you feel like you are at your local hangout.  First is a great place to wind down, or get amped up. First is all about lounging in a chair, jeans and comfy t-shirt,  throwing back some brews with your friends.  Or it can be about sharing a comfortable sofa with friends and their pretty heels.     The joint  is LOUNGE open late for all your party needs.

2.5 Scramble, I wanted to love you, but I walked away just loving your coffee.   Hey, the concept is great, but some of the stuff served here reminded me of stuff I make on the weekends when I have time to cook.  Although they had a lot of seemingly tasty options, my huevos rancheros were nothing exciting.    My dish consisted of  blue corn & quinoa chips, spicy soyrizo, covered with 3 eggs, cheddar and seasoned black beans. I liked the pico de gallo, but I needed more spice.  My pal ordered a panini, while my other pal got an egg white omelet. All of us walked away yearning for more, but with hopes that it could be better.   Guess we will need to come back and try again. Based on my SF and Portland eats, this just didn't measure up.

Kombucha on tap? It's the new thing....?  Ok, i'll bite.  Flower child satisfies my inner granola girl.  Their slogan goes something like: healthy food for a happy world serving local produce.     Not super hungry, I chose to order some sides and share.  Here's what I got AND recommend:  ####Heirloom tomato and watermelon with thai basil, sea salt, and olive oil.  Delicious.  Loved that this was dairy free and delicious.   ####Roasted Asparagus with toasted umami. I would eat asparagus everyday if it was like this.   #####Beets, avocado, and citrus-  Additionally, I sampled one of the best vegan cheesecakes EVER and a chocolate chip cookie.  Delish.  If you are looking to sample Kombucha for the first time, I suggest trying it here. Their GT's trilogy kombucha was gooood.    Flower Child, please come to Norcal. We need a dope, healthy place like this in the BAY.

Let say for a moment, you could stuff your face with tacos and sushi.  Or Pollo chicharon with kimchee fried rice...at the same place.  AT THE SAME PLACE?!?  Yup.   This joint, does exactly that.   concept-5 stars.  Mexican and Japanese fused together? YES. food-5 stars: FLAVOR EXPLOSIONS in your mouth? YES.  For detail, see below.  decor:  5 stars: I felt like I was in some hip LA restaurant, complete with the plastics. service: 5 stars: I never felt like I needed to find someone to fill my water or give me food. Props to everyone being attentive and gracious with the food suggestions. drinks: 5 stars-I had a Tokyo mule, 'nuff said.   We ordered, and it's recommended, you share a variety of plates.  It's tapas/family style so, you'll want to order a variety of things to sample.  Our list:  LUMP CRAB GUACAMOLE-fresh, seasoned well, and served with fried tortillas-YUMM.  CHICHARRON DE POLLO-imagine spicy chicken tenders, but better. YUP. KIMCHEE FRIED RICE-eggs, mushroom, and a kick. Paired well with beef. YES ROLLO CHINGON-adobo, jalapeno, and a strawberry glaze.  Top seller, and pretty good. YUP. VIETNAMESE STYLE "SHAKING BEEF"-filet mignon with an amazing serrano chile sauce-YES.  Everything was awesome, and I'm embarrassed to tell you that I wanted to order more.   Highly recommend.  Not only for the food, but for the people watching.
