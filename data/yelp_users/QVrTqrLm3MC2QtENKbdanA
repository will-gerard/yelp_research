I am so glad that friends of mine took me to this restaurant, because I would have never stopped in had I just seen it from the street. The location in a strip mall with a nondescript front definitely does not do justice what awaits you inside. The place is quaint and the decor a strange mixture of Asian and Western European influences. Of note is that the friends who look me were actually Japanese - always  good sign when choosing Asian restaurants. My absolute favorite dish is the hot udon soup with either chicken or veggies but I have tried several other dishes and have enjoyed them. One of the cool things in this restaurant is the curious mixture of Asian and Italian cuisine. Unfortunately, the one time my boyfriend tried out an Italian dish the noodles tasted a bit stale. That was the only time though that I have not thoroughly enjoyed myself there.

Before I review the Morrison Vein Institute I have to mention that I am a physician myself and as such it has always been difficult to go anywhere and be a patient. However, I have been so impressed with the Morrison Vein Institute, that I not only felt the need to write a review, but also to give it my first 5 star rating.  Everyone that works there, from the front office staff to the nurses to the physicians have been nothing but accommodating, helpful, and knowledgeable. They do not contract with any insurances but will go to great lengths to do what's needed to get you reimbursed.  Dr. Morrison is not only the founder and director of the institute, he continues to use his expertise in patient care and is one of the nicest people you'll ever meet. When I found out that he would do my procedure, I knew I was in good hands.  I recommend this practice with no reservations, regardless if you have longstanding venous insufficiency or just need a couple of spider veins removed.

Don't get the cookies. That's my main advice. I have been going to Lux quite frequently since they moved to their new location. I love the layout, the decor, the staff, the coffee and bar drinks, their baked goods - at least I did until I tried the cookies. They were not cheap ($1 a piece and not particularly large), but I believe in spending a bit more for small business's sake and good quality. That's why I was so disappointed. The coconut macaroons were so hard that they completely crumbled when biting into them. I am still not sure if they were just old or just poorly made. The pistachio divinity on the other hand so sweet that even I, who has never met a carbohydrate she has not liked, could not eat them. I picked out the pistachios and threw the rest away.  I still love Lux and I will be back - I just won't get the cookies.

After driving by this place about a million times I finally remembered it when the old "Where shall we go to eat" question came up and I am now definitely a fan. I asked the server (Chico - he was great and seemed to really love working there) about his recommendations and tried the Salmon Spinach Enchilada which will be difficult to move on from when I go back. It was absolutely amazing and I tried my hardest to finish my plate. Only reason I did not give this place five stars is that the ambiance in the back room was a bit lacking. It was more cafeteria-styled and just not very warm and inviting. Regardless, I know that I will be back and definitely introduce this place to out of town guests!

I really was hoping that I would like Harley's, as it is super close to us and would be the perfect neighborhood Italian place. Unfortunately, I was rather underwhelmed by today's experience. This is the first time I have actually been inside. I heard that it has recently been redone, so I cannot compare it to prior, but I thought the place looked rather inviting. Unfortunately, the food is just not that good. We had the calamari fritti, which I consider a safe choice. They did not taste bad - they tasted like nothing at all. I tried putting lemon on them, then marinara sauce, then salt. Finally I dipped them in olive oil. Each time it made them more memorable, but not more edible. We also tried the pizza (both the Italian meat pizza and the pesto chicken one). If I had bought a frozen pizza at the store and it tasted like that fresh out of the oven I would have thought of it as pretty good pizza and probably bought it again. However, I expect more of an Italian restaurant, especially considering how long it took to prepare (and there was only one other couple in the entire place).  Overall, I am just disappointed. This place has great potential. I'm not saying I'll never come back. Maybe I'll have better luck with a pasta dish in the future. I just know it won't be for a while.

I have actually eaten here about four times already, always with the best intentions of giving it yet another chance, but I just  have never had that great of an experience at True Food. Today took the cake, when the waiter left with my half-eaten pizza to box it up for me and never returned for the rest of the night, neither to refill the water, nor to check on whether my friend and I needed anything else, nor to return aforementioned pizza. Unfortunately at that time we had already paid (which I guess explains his inattention) and I honestly could not remember the guy's face to track him down. But even had the service been outstanding tonight, the food has failed to impress me just about every time. Today I had the eggplant pizza, which was ok but the dough rather tasteless. In the past I have tried the miso cod (ok but not worth the $22 they charge) and some ravioli that were rather unmemorable but have since apparently been removed from the menu (I think they were stuffed with butternut squash). The only dish I have ever really liked is the Edamame Dumpling appetizer - if another friend of mine has their heart set on True Foods in the future maybe I will just have to get 2 orders of those. The decor is nice enough but the tables are too close together for my taste and the noise level inside quite excessive.  All together not a place that I will ever frequent again if the choice is left up to me.

Postino's has been one of my favorite restaurants for several years now, and even though I know in the big scheme of things one more 5 star review won't matter, I still feel the need to add my praise.  I love the ambiance. Though it can get a bit loud and crowded, that's what happens when a place is popular. Both the inside and outside decor are both modern, yet extremely comfortable. The menu is simple but tastefully done. I love the bruschettas, the paninis, the salads, the desserts.... This is one of my favorite places for brunch, and I have even used them to cater one of my parties with great success. As a matter of fact, now that I am writing this, I think I will go back tomorrow. It already has been too long.

Parlor has become one of my favorites to get pizza. While the dough may not be quite as amazing as at Pizzeria Bianco's it is a close second, and the fact that you do not have to wait 3-4 hours for a table more than makes up for this.  Whenever we go we make a point to order the Funghi pizza, which never fails to be a favorite among all the people we introduce to the place either. I have also had several of their soups du jour and have never been disappointed.  The ambiance is nice - I hear that much of the wood has been reclaimed from the beauty parlor days and that is just plain cool.

I have been driving by this place for months now, always thinking that I would like to try it out as it looked intriguing even from the outside. Last night my boyfriend and I were in the neighborhood and on a whim decided to give it a try. We will definitely be back! I do love the open concept of the restaurant. It is quite spacious inside, which was nice, since it allowed us to be seated right away on a Friday night at 7:30, yet it still felt cozy enough to be romantic. The wait staff was very prompt and friendly and very helpful when it came to recommending food. I love the fact that they make their own pasta and sausage, by the way, and had to try both - one in the form of the pork belly gnocci, the other as their sausage pizza. Both were so delicious, that we finished every last morsel on our plates. We even decided to give the desserts a try and had the salted caramel something or the other, which was a wonderful combination of flavors.  The one minus, and it is a small one, is that both my boyfriend and I smelled like food, as you are literally sitting in the kitchen. But it is a price I am very willing to pay again and again!

I am so excited! My boyfriend and I have been saying for a while that what our neighborhood is missing is it's own frozen yogurt place. Today it seems as if our prayers had been answered. Not only is the location super convenient, the ambiance is at the same time cool and cozy. I would have come here even if the yogurt had been mediocre but the flavors I tried today were all absolutely delicious! (I had the caramel, the milk chocolate, and the cookies and cream) The toppings are of a nice variety and freshness as well! I know I will be a regular. I am just a little worried about the crowds, as I am sure this place will become a quick favorite for all who stop by.
