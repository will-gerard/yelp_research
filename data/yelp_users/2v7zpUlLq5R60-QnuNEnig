I called requesting a stylist that had an expertise in baby fine blonde hair. I left a 90second voice mail and received a call back from Brittany and we spoke for 10mins where I clearly explained what I wanted. Low lights of brown in my light blonde hair, not too many, just to give my hair depth and the make my blue eyes even more bright blue. I was clear that I hated ash tones and didn't want any.   I got so many low lights that it resulted in an all over color of a dull, ashy, dirty blonde. Brittany after the process realized I didn't get what I requested and told me to "let her know if I wanted darker strips put in?" Her station is beside a red neon sign that casts a red hue on the hair making it impossible to determine the color you actually have. I left and once in natural light knew I hated it. I cried, I'd lost my shine and now was a muddy blonde. My neighbor talked me into texting her about it. "Give her the chance to do the right thing." I did and we scheduled an appointment.   Upon going in Brittany was cold, and then grabbed another stylist who was more experienced. That stylist immediately moved me from the chair beside the neon light to her station to determine my actual color. I was uncomfortable  as I felt bad that I wasn't happy and was having her redo it. I brought my friend and we both clarified I wanted to be blonde with brown streaks. I did NOT want all over color, I did NOT want any ASH tones and I did NOT want to have brown hair. The experienced stylist was clear then Brittany started the process. It took almost 3 hours. Of doing tons of little lowlights. Both my friend and I tried to make the conversation nice, and light. I didn't know then that if you do too many lowlights it results in an all over color appearance. Well that is what I got. An all over gray, green, ashy color and lost all my blonde. All my shine. I am sick over it and cry constantly.

Glorious!!!!!!  My mouth is watering just thinking of the risotto. Dessert was decadent and perfectly sized. Not too small and not too big to make you have sugar hang over the next day.

In LOVE!!!! Julie not only waxed everything and I mean everything. She just waxed all hair in the bikini area. She didn't measure and attempt to up-sale me. She waxed my belly button and did the inner thigh so I would feel completely comfy in a bikini of the smallest of proportions. Granted I have no desire to be in a bikini of any size. I feel lighter, happier, and the vegan wax makes me healthier than the petrol chemical wax of the other place.   I used to go to the chain wax place and they did a half-assed job and would miss everything. I learned to just tolerate the inadequate wax. They would do two fingers from the crease in my leg and anything beyond that was additional money. I'd end up paying a fortune for a wax job I hated.

Amazing!!!!!  Educational, Fun, and phobia curing.   I got to go to two different shows. One at an elementary school where it was a hands on, learning experience. You get to hold each animal, learn about them, see the sweetness in creatures I once thought were kinda icky. You also get the option of doing a few fear factoresque challenges, like worm eating, bug eating, and getting bugs put all over you. Granted it is a choice, but boy is it fun to watch people do it.   I then went to the Peoria Halloween Show and held animals I didn't even know existed. Skinks, dragons, and then all sorts of snakes, reptiles, and they seem cuddly and cute after you learn all about them.
