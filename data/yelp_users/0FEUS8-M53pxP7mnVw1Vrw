Food from the grill good. Sushi was absolutely horrible, esp the eel sauce on the caterpillar. Yuck Not to mention they charged a 15% grat to a party of 5... seriously?  3 adults, 1 child tepanki,  I had sushi. Never come here... I  knew it was bad the first time I tried it. Yuck Server was horrible... had no idea the difference between a Pinot nior and a Pinot Grigio... come on, your a server! Smh

As everybody has said, I wish there was a zero star for a review. This is the worst property management company I have ever had to deal with. They never return phone calls, they sent out bogus notices to addresses with no viable proof that the property is in fact violation of something. They say it is not cost effective to print out a photograph and mail it with the violation to the address. There is obviously favoritism for certain residents in the community.   The community is slowly looking like a ghetto. Lack of rock in certain areas, badly trimmed landscaping makes the property look old outdated and unmanaged.  Too many unmanaged rental properties with blight conditions around entire sub make it look horrible. All in need a painting. They do NOTHING for what we pay them.

I purchased a DVR through Amazon it was a Channel Master DVR. I bought it September 18th of 2014 and I just called today which is December 5th. The reason for my call was my remote is not working.  Living in Mesa and finding out the location is in Gilbert (3 miles away) they sent me through an entire process of a warranty claim, and service call for somebody to call me back and set up an appointment just to get me a new remote.  Within 24 hours of a work day. So that means Monday for me. How insane is that? I just need a new remote. The product isn't even four months old!!! I have a year warranty.   The way the DVR was made it does not have any buttons on the machine itself, so you have to use the remote to turn on your TV and the DVR. Now I have to dismantle my DVR, losing all my prescheduled recorded programs and hook my HD antenna directly to my TV, thus losing everything on my DVR that is going to be recorded in the next few days. (Or until a service tech calls?). This is such an inconvenience I can't believe they won't just replace my remote. I can drive there!!  I will update this review as it takes place, I am not happy about this!  I will also be writing a review on Amazon.

First time here... came on Saturday about 10:30 pm. Computers were down, so NOTHING could be rang in. It all had to be a cash deal. Who carries cash these days? Anyhow with a group of girls we ordered drinks... 4 budlights, and a Pinot nor for myself. The bill was $35! Wow? Because the computer was down we had no physical bill in front of us to prove that was the actual amount that we should have been charged. None-the-less drink the drinks came we had a conversation at the bar. The bartender was very nice and had no problems with her humor, professionalism and our conversation. We then decided to get a round of shots for our friends birthday. The bartender suggested orange creamsicles. We all agreed and were told that before shots were $38. Wow. Four shots (not topshelf cordials) were $9.50 each? Expensive!  Anyway we sat there at the bar upstairs and enjoyed ourselves but we were questioning how much the drinks actually were. Upon leaving we ran into several people who were there longer than us because they had large birthday parties. It took them one hour and 40 minutes to cash out. The server they had had no written documentation for what they had ordered so it was a guesstimate on what their bill should be. Then they had no way to physically copy their credit card but had to hand write it. Very unprofessional, they didn't even have any old fashioned credit card swiping machines. I don't understand how companies systems can continually crash and leave the customers in a predicament about paying their bills. Not sure I want to go back....
