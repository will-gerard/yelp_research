They said the wait would be 20 minutes and I ended up walking out after 45 minutes of waiting. I'm not really upset about the wait as much as the bad expectation setting. I've had my haircut here before and they did ok, but I will be looking elsewhere in the future.

Very good experience. The pizza was great and the toasted ravioli were a great starter. The pizza cookie is one of the best in town. They did put in an order for the wrong pizza at first, but change it as soon as they realized what happened, with no questions, which was fantastic.

Fantastic food once again. The Fish tacos are some of the best I've ever had and the service is always quick. The mango salsa on the tacos really put them over the top. This is the type of food that fills you up and doesn't make you feel bad for it.

Great night out to celebrate my 27th birthday. Food was amazing, the atmosphere was very laid back, but still has a high end feel. The service was fantastic. Drinks stayed full the whole time. Filet bites were the highlight of the meal followed by the cookie skillet desert. Great for groups. Check them out!

Great pizza and fantastic service! I came here for lunch and will definitely be back. Also, the pizza comes out fast, which is perfect if you're pressed for time. The buffalo chicken pizza was my favorite, but any of the choices are delicious!
