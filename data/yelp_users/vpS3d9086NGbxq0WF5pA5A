Since I moved to AZ from Los Angeles I have been searching far and wide for a sushi place that met my high standards for great sushi. Sakana is hands down the best in town. The fish is fresh, the rolls are huge and nothing beats the .50 cent appetizers when you buy a beer! I recommend going on a weeknight, Friday and Saturday nights can fill up pretty quickly so you might have to wait.... but it's worth it.

I'm tempted not to write about this place because I don't want everyone to know about the little gem I discovered just a little north of Fashion Square. Mandy's has THE cutest selection of clothes and is so reasonable for being an independent boutique in Scottsdale. I found this store while I was desperately searching for a dress to wear to my friends wedding. I was ready to spend $150, ended up with the cutest dress for $88. Since I had already been prepared to spend $150, I didn't feel so bad buying another dress for the evening before! Although I was on a mission for a dress, I did peep out some cute shirts and jeans on the rack that will most likely be in my closet after I get my next pay check.

It's always a good feeling leaving your hair stylist knowing you look good. I have been going here for a few years and I have never been disappointed. You do not need to worry about getting a cut that doesn't work for your face or your style. Only draw back is the parking, make sure you have quarters if you end up at a meter.

If you live anywhere in the greater Phoenix area and have not been to Pita Jungle you are missing out. By far the best Greek food around! The falafel pita, glazed chicken pizza, and the medchilada (combination of a chicken burrito and enchilada Greek style -- not on the menu anymore but if you ask they will make it) are some of my favorites, but really anything you get is good. Oh and the tzatziki (cucumber yogurt dip), it's so amazing... just go to Pita Jungle, that's my review.

I still don't know why I keep going back here... perhaps it's because Cafe Carumba seems like one of the only legit breakfast/brunch spots where a large group can meet to have mimosas on a Saturday morning. It's not the food that is the problem, it is the wait for your food. Recently I went here with a group of 8, we were seated on the patio for at least 10-15 minutes before the server made it to our table. He took our drink orders (even though we were ready to order food since we had enough time to read the menu 3 times front and back) and again we didn't see him for 10-15 minutes. Our drinks came and went yet our food and server were no where to be found. It was an hour before we finally ate. After the server put all our plates down he went to the table next to us who had been seated for about 10 minutes and said they would have to wait an hour for their food and he recommended they go somewhere else! I couldn't believe the waiter pretty much told them to leave! It was busy, but not out of the ordinary for a beautiful Saturday morning in Scottsdale. Unfortunately I don't think my opinion will persuade my group of friends to find a better brunch spot, so I will see you next Saturday.

The Vig is awesome. Perfect place to go with friends or coworkers after a long day at the office to have a glass of wine off and enjoy either an appetizer or my favorite Steak Salad. Also a great place for people watching since you get an eclectic mix of the Scottsdale/Phoenix scene.

This was the first time I ever tried a Pasty, but won't be the last. I met a friend here for lunch and was very surprised by the little hole in the wall establishment that provided big flavors. I had the philly cheese-steak pasty and it was great. Took the OG one home to my boyfriend and he loved it... he asked why I didn't bring him 2. The menu is big so anyone can find something they will most definitely enjoy. I'll be going back soon for more.
