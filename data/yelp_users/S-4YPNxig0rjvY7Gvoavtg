Good food. Fast service. Great prices. The servers could be a little more polite, but will for sure return.

I have tried this place a few times. I would have to say the food was ok. However, first visit eggshells where found in the rice. Understandable, it happens! Second time paper was in one if the dishes. Ok. This last visit was the last. Service was horrible. And also in a cold dish, a cockroach. I politely gave my plate to the server, who seemed like this was a norm. Then headed to the restroom, where I returned my meal. No apology was given. I paid my check and waived good bye. Eaters beware, nasty items are in the food!
