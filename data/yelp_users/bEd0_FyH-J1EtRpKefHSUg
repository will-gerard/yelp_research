Our go-to neighborhood bar. This Zipp's far outweighs the Camelback location, in  my opinion. Maybe it's the more "in-tune" servers or just the overall better quality of food - but we always choose this one to quench our wing and beer cravings! Their medium buffalo wings are the best in the valley that I've personally had and their happy hour drink specials cannot be beat. It's hard to find a really good happy hour  but these guys do it right. If you want a good premium pint, a dozen medium wings and good service overall - Zipps' on Via De Ventura is the spot you should choose!

Can I give a no star rating? This may be a little more detailed than necessary but in order to get the point across, it must be said. Being a really big Nebraska Husker fan...I have spent many a dime in this place because it turns into Husker Mecca once Saturday rolls around. But, no more. I was treated rudely on a packed game day waiting for a table that I had already "claimed" by asking the folks that were leaving if we could have their table, they said "of course, no one else has asked us", so we made friends and began chatting it up and waiting for their game to end. Then, apparently the server felt it was her place to interject and tell me that another group of 10 was there first and deserved to have the 4 top table. I said, well, they should have gone to the seated guests and requested that they give them the table than. Not sure how or why this escalated into what it did but it ended up in me graciously gaving up the table of which i was already sitting at to the rude 19 year olds that caused the issue in the first place. Since they had such a large party they really should have come hours in advance in order to claim their own table for their giant group. That's what most people do. I was treated rudely by the server and she was making remarks under her breath (apparently she was having a bad day and was taking it out on me). Even my guy friend had to turn to her and tell her to "watch her mouth". This was a SERVER! Maybe someone should have reminded her that you shouldn't litterally chase customers away. Well, they lost a customer for life and I am one to recommend the places I like, hence, giving them more business. So it's too bad they won't be on that list. On top of all of the drama, their food is horrible, their service is horrible and their lack of consideration of loyalty and good patrons is beyond me. If you want a good Husker Bar for a Saturday game...go to Clancy's on Miller and Camelback. At least here you don't get treated like a child in an adult atmosphere and if you want to snag a table the old fashioned way, you're allowed.

How this place has less than four stars is a mystery to me. I have been 5 times and have taken out of towners here 2 out of the 5 and they all left saying it was yummy too. The El Presidential Especiale is a MUST - i order 86 the onions and add machaca/shredded beef. They are a simple yummy combination with their rice and beans. This is just straight up classic mexican food - not for the snobby. So if you want a more classy joint that's less authentic - hit up Z'Tejas cause this place is not for you. The hot salsa in the ketchup bottles is always a sign of a great mexican joint (and it's hot AND tastey - a combination not many get correct). I will say their chips can be a little on the less crunchy, more oily side but they are more than happy to replace that with some that are a little more to your liking. And their margs are delish as well. This place deserves a 4 because of consistency, friendly and accomodating atmosphere and just downright solid take on enchiladas - red sauce is spot on. Thanks Tee Pee for being our go-to for Mexican food in the Valley of the Sun!

Always Consistent. If a restaurant can't nail down consistency...what's the point? Knowing what you're getting when you go is a plus.   This place has been here for a long time. There used to be a Popo's Too on the east side until it sadly closed down. My sister and I were not happy campers. But low and behold the original is still alive and well and kickin' great dishes EXACTLY LIKE THEY DID ON THE EAST SIDE! Again, consistency. The owner is always present and taking checks, seating guests and that again is an added bonus. Everything is fresh, the rice is great, unlike most places here where it's just starchy and gross and the medium salsa is always yummy. Request the hot salsa as well...it's not overly hot and quite frankly not sure why it's their "hot" salsa but regardless-it's deliscious. I had the El Pollo Especial except I ordered it not fried and with Machaca beef...and they were of course accomodating. The jalepeno cream cheese they top it with is well, excessive, however a little goes along way and I'll be eating the other half for dinner.   If you get the opportunity to go, go. The margaritas are also quite yummy and who can go wrong with $.99 ritas for happy hour. Just wish they were closer to Scottsdale!

Holy Salty Soup! I literally JUST went there over my lunch break and I can't even eat the chicken noodle soup because its so salty...it almost burns. I am HIGHLY disappointed that a deli cannot do yummy chicken noodle soup properly. Its like I poured 2 salt packets into my mouth. I got the 1/2 sandwich and soup combo and for $7.75 you would think the sandwich (the Symphony) would be a lot bigger than what I got. It's basically the size of a half of a ham and cheese I make at home. Although the sandwich was kinda tasty, for a half, it's still TINY and not worth it for $7.75 and a cup of a salt. I don't think I'll go back. I am disappointed.  There just isn't a good sandwich shop around here, I guess. Boo.

This review is for Sales Only - I am giving 5 starts as that is what I gave them in the formal Right Honda review they sent directly to me.  My husband and I have been researching automobiles for well over a year when we finally decided to get out and test drive our top picks.  Although we were in the market for a hybrid, we inevitably purchased a 2013 Honda Accord EXL, obviously not a hybrid.  The hybrids we DID test drive included the Ford Fusion which was a very nice car, just not enough leg room for my tall husband...and the Honda Civic.  The Accord is in a totally different class and the 2013 is beautiful.  I'm on day two of ownership and can't wait to leave work so I can drive it home!  Juan helped us on our test driving and was knowledgeable.  Then Right brought out, as my hubby and I referred to him as, "the closer" AKA Gaston.  He was helpful and nice and most definitely good as his craft.  It takes a special kind of someone to sell cars and whatever that special part is...he's got it.  We may have been easy targets though because, I was pretty much sold on an Accord because of my familiarity with it and this was my ultimate pick for a car. Also, I had already told my husband, "we're buying today".  We were hook, line and sinker and for good reason.  My old car, a Nissan Altima, felt as if it were about to give out on me.  All of this considered, we were treated respectfully.  The sales team was just that...a team. Going in, we were already educated about how the process works and we knew what we could and could not make exceptions to as far as our choice and what we were looking for in a car...and we got what we wanted (with a little bit of waiver).  I may update my review once I have experienced the service side and after reading the other reviews I hope I don't change my rating. Only time will tell.  If you decide to test drive from Right Honda, ask for Juan or Gaston and please let them know Elissa & Matt sent you! :)  Happy Hunting!

Great service, cold beer (Mr. Pineaple, yum!). My cousin ordered the Smokehouse Pork Belly Burger and loved it. How can you go wrong really? And I ordered the Cochinita Pork Pibil and it was quite tastey. The place was packed for a Wednesday night and it definitely reminded me of (dare I say it...) Four Peaks but I felt that their menu was more diverse than that other brewery of which I am highly loyal but definitely better food options here. I don't get into Old Town Chandler often as I live in Scottsdale but I would go out of my way again soon to get a 2nd visit under my belt.

Four words: Tomato, Garlic, mushroom pizza. Two more: Meat Lasagna.  Been dining and ordering delivery from here since they opened. Great delivery time and the food is always consistent. I'm not a big fan of square cut pies so I always request it be sliced. The toasted club, tuna salad sandwich, garlic cheese bread (OMG!) and crinkle cut fries are also favorites. Don't forget the made in-house ranch dressing that is the best ranch you can order out. Pick up a bottle of red wine, order the large meat lasagna to share with your sweetie and an order of garlic cheese bread - you will NOT be sorry. Delish.

After reading all the raves about the green chili mac & cheese it was a must have - and then immediate regret. The green chilies were chewy and not peeled properly and the cheese in the mac was grainy and gritty. Yuck. Mac & cheese is by definition...cheesy and smooth. Not this. Horrible. The good side was the pulled pork sandwich and the hot BBQ was pretty darn good. All in all when I want good BBQ my choice would be Honey Bears first. But if I'm hard up and just gotta have some BBQ, I would consider Andrew's again.

For being so patriotic and the "All American" that TK portrays himself to be, it's a wonder that I Love This Bar & Grill can tout they are a love of...well, anyone's. Went to see Rev. Horton Heat (which was quite great) here on Thursday which is why I give it the 2nd star. However, I was shocked to discover that PBR's were $5 a can and a well rum and diet was an eye-popping $8! I cannot judge the food...nor will I ever...as I will not return to this establishment ever again. From the looks of it, the food resembled Applebee's, the bartender didn't seem to know his a$# from a hole in the ground and the prices kept fluctuating throughout the night. Bad service, bad drink prices, Good entertainment (bonus) but overall rip-off.

1/2 star. Max. I have been to different locations of this chain.  My friend, a University of Phoenix graduate, made reservations here for 12:30 Saturday 5/4 immediately following the ceremony.  A portion of our party arrived early and proceeded to order cocktails, a few apps, etc. Upon the rest of the party's arrival, the service remained decent. It wasn't until we were ready to order and notified the server as such...that our order was not taken for an additional 15-20 minutes.  She instead proceeded to other large party to take their order. Once we finally got our order in...we waited...and waited...and waited for nearly an hour (if not more by some of our party's calculations) for our food. My husband met us for lunch from the other side of town and needless to say...he had to take his food to-go in order to make it to work on time. They did comp his meal entirely as was expected at this point.  Darrell (the so called GM) apologized and made somewhat of an attempt to right the situation with free COLD appetizers prior to the meal arriving and at the end of it giant cotton candy served in large martini style glasses followed by a piss poor dessert of rock hard crumbly brownies. Sorry, that doesn't remedy the situation.  A portion of our meals were comped and rightfully so.  I can understand that they got slammed after graduation...but know your area...and know that there is a COLLEGE GRADUATION right next door to your restaurant!  Getting "slammed" is not the guests fault...it's YOUR fault for not staffing appropriately.  When I look around the restaurant and see your hostesses gabbing and standing around while our table fills up with empty and NON-REFILLED glasses and dirty appetizer plates, maybe they need to be trained to do a little bussing as well...i mean, you're ''slammed" right? All hands on deck?  I guess not.  I will never return to another Saddle Ranch... anywhere...ever. My guess is that many others will not either as this place will not remain open if this is how it's operated. Horrible.

I've been here a few times now and it's definitely growing on me! It's a great place to meet centrally for Happy Hours and the TV set up is pretty great! I haven't tried out the beer pong tables yet but I do see that in my near future. The service is friendly, the bathrooms are clean, the food is pretty good and the beer is reasonably priced! All in all, until I have a bad experience here or an absolutely unbelievably great one, I'll give it a solid 3.5 and weigh heavy on the 4 since there are no 1/2 star ratings. The new owners are usually mingling around which always let's me know they care about their patrons and what is happening with their establishment.

I have been to Sombrero's a couple of times and enjoyed it immensely.  So much so that  I am picking up food to take home for my family today. Their red chile pork is amazing and the chile diablo salsa is so yummy!  The corn shell tacos are my first pick and their jalepeno cream cheese is a nice addition if you MUST have additional dairy (although not typical mexican style to do so).   I would love to try their nachos but can't seem to steer away from the tacos.  Side note - if you can't find their sign, it's under the Taqueria store front! They really do need to get signage out there. I have been to this center many times and until i read YELP I wouldn't have known it was there. Glad I found them. My husband is too!

Good traditional mex in my opinion.  My husband got the al pastor and it was DELISH! I kept picking the meat of his plate.  I had the cheese enchilada, chile relleno and crunchy taco with rice and beans and the plates are HUGE. Luckily this makes good left overs. Definitely check it out and get the pastor. So good!

Not sure what all the complaining is about. I have been to Barrio Queen twice. First time was when they had just opened and will admit, it was a bit of a mess but the food was still tastey. The taco list was a bit overwhelming. But this time, my husband and I went on a Saturday afternoon and had a GREAT experience. In fact, because of my high alert due to the not so great reviews on Yelp, I paid special attention to those diners that were leaving (as we sat near the door).  I observed and overheard their attitude and comments to the host. I did not hear a single negative comment or see a single look of disappointment.  In fact, it was the opposite. Diners were expressing how delicious the food was with hearty "thank you, we will return", "will you take our picture in front of your "barrio queen" painting?" and my personal favorite "can we speak to the manager to let him know how great our experience was...our server was awesome!"  We ordered the Pollo y Chorizo Tacos to share and they were yums! I would probably order JUST these and a house margarita - which were also very tastey. In addition, we order the Elote (bowl of corn, cannot recall the exact menu item name) and the mexican style fries that are listed on the appetizer menu, again, sorry I cannot recall and cannot access the menu on their website to reference. Our server was attentive and knowledgable, the atmosphere less hectic than the first time around and the menu has been refined to be easier to read and not so over-the-top as far as choices and number of items.   This may quickly become our new place for street style tacos and margaritas. We have to check out Taco Tuesday for SURE very soon.  Run don't walk to Barrio Queen for a cool atmosphere, a refreshing margarita and some tastey Pollo y Chorizo Tacos!

Had a hankering for grilled hot dogs with all the fixins',  when my husband came home and mentioned Brat Haus.  Newly opened in Oregano's old flagship location in Old Town Scottsdale, this place was great!  The servers are all attentive and helpful with suggestions and the beers are plentiful.  We enjoyed a Spaten Oktoberfest and a Krombacher Pils.  With over two dozens brews on draft, it was hard to decide. No domestics here, friends, and that's the way it should be.  We were recommended the fundido, stone hearth-baked pretzels, perfectly salted and served with a creamy cheese sauce and spicy mustard. For dinner, the Spicy Brat with root beer grilled onions and Apricot Onion Chutney.  They use Niman Ranch pork, chicken and beef for all of their sausages which made me instantly add another star to my review.  The  Spicy Brat's casing was perfect...soft yet snappy and not too thick. I was happy with the sausage. Next time, I'll order the Beer Brat. The Apricot Chutney was also delicious! For our side, we chose fries with Truffle Aioli and Bleu Cheese-Bacon Sauce.  Both of their sauces were good as well. For dessert...well, I was way too full to even consider it, but when Dave Andrea himself highly suggest you get the Drunken Date Cake...you DO IT! I will return JUST to get a piece of this cake again.  Dave was right...the cake did not make it to the next day. Made with oatmeal stout and topped with ice cream and caramel sauce...this was phenomenal. My husband and I fought over who got the last bite!   We will definitely return!

Do I have to rate them? I really wanted to like them. Second time here. Still here now actually. The servers are super nice. The kitchen however clearly doesn't care... Nor does the owner. The owner was identified and this person did nothing but maybe clear two glasses from the bar...that belonged to a friend. I ordered a taco salad. What salad, I asked? Barely two leaves of lettuce and literally a quarter of a hamburger patty topped the "salad". The SALAD! Sent it back. Ordered pretzels cause who can screw that up? The cheese sauce was half goo and 1/2 something else. I just don't get it. If you can't expedite decent looking grub then don't serve it. And give a shit...just a little...about what the end game is. The beers on draft are decent. The servers are friendly but aside from that don't come hungry. It's not worth your disgust or gut ache.

Great little spot with friendly staff and chill vibe! Go. Here. Nothing better than supporting your local spots. Solid salsa, tasty margs and tacos are bomb-diggity! Ask for Rebecca or Renee
