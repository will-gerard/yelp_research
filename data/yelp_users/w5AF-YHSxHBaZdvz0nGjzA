Sakana is the best sushi spot I've been to in the valley, granted I have not been to many, but it's my favorite yet!  They have a great atmosphere, service, and last but not least, sushi!  They always have great deals going on and have a large variety of things to choose from!  Every time I have been to Sakana there has been a group there celebrating some sort of special occasion (birthdays particularly), it seems like a great place for them too!

Visited AMF on a lazy Friday afternoon when it was way too hot to do anything outside.  The girl at the counter was friendly and knowledgeable, was quick to tell us the best deals, give us our shoes, and show us to our lane.  My husband and I played for two hours for less than $20, which got us about 4-5 games.  There happened to be cosmic bowling going on at the time which added another layer of fun, but the Disney pop music and corresponding music videos on repeat was pretty brutal.

After recently returning from Oahu and Maui where I indulged on local cuisine I was craving some good (and cheap) Hawaiian BBQ.  Mokis was the perfect place to put all my cravings to rest.    Prior to visiting Hawaii in March I never knew exactly what "Island" or "Hawaiian" BBQ was, but now every time I come across any place with a hibiscus flower in the logo I gotta stop and try it out!  Who knew all the way in Arizona, people were doing Hawaiian food, good?!    Mokis has everything that I ate in Hawaii over 7 days all in one spot, from garlic shrimp, to kalua pork to loco moco, even poke and shave iced!  It was hard to choose just one thing so now I have several reasons to return!  I enjoyed the teriyaki chicken with rice and traditional mac salad, everything was delicious and just what I was craving!

In terms of italian-restuarant chains, this is near the bottom of the list for me.  Mainly due to it's prices and menu selection.  The ambiance is great, but that can only make up for so much.    The menu is limited, the most appealing things on it are within the appetizers.  The entree's are steep in price and are limited to a certain pallette.  Also, the prices are not directly correlated to portions, for what you pay for I would expect much larger portions.    Overall, if you're looking for appetizers and a drink, this may be a good spot, but if you're looking for bang-for-your-buck portions, this is not the place for you.  Choose Olive Garden or Buca di Bepo instead.

**HIGHLY RECOMMEND!**   My boyfriend and I recently visited the Shane Company and absolutely fell in love.  My boyfriend was reluctant because all he could see were dollar signs, but soon after entering that subsided and we dove right into the bridal area of the store.    We were immediately greeted by an employee who took time to learn about our visit and our purpose for being there and he immediately began showing us around.  They take you through all cases, case by case, and allow you to have three rings out at a time, making the process of elimination very easy.  They also bring out the gem you desire within your price point to show you the full picture.    Upon choosing the setting, they bring out several gems in your price point and educate you about them, so you choose the right one for you.  If you happen to find your perfect ring, they have great payment methods including layaway, financing, or full cash.    The staff is super friendly and excited for you.  The ambiance is great, they don't miss a beat here.  Even showing you your ring under natural lighting, fluorescent, and LED to get the full picture.    LOVE THIS PLACE!

Love this spot!  Grew up nearby and never checked it out until I was much older and no longer lived nearby, wish I would have known about it sooner because I've been missing out! Guidos gives you the genuine Italian deli feel you wouldn't expect in AZ and their top notch Italian eats transport you.  Haven't had a chance to try everything on the menu, but what I can say is everything I have had is perfection!  The servings are large and the prices are fair.  Also, don't forget dessert, they have some genuine Spumoni and decadent cannolis that'll have you rolling out the door.  Bon appetit!

One of my favorite hidden treasures in Tempe.  If you have been in the Tempe area you probably have driven past this family establishment, it doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you enter it's like being in someone's home.    The ambiance here is very intimate and comforting, as if you're in the family's personal dining room enjoying their recipes passed down from generation to generation.  The service is exceptional, always bringing you more bread, filling your glass before it empties, and asking if you need anything.    The food is tradtional italian fare, they offer you bread as soon as you sit down and nearly everything meal comes with your choice of garden salad or soup, unlike a lot of restaurants today where it's an additional cost.  They have a wide vareity to choose from and everything I've had there has been great.    I highly reccomend Riazzi's during the holiday's, the decorate the interior beautifully and really put you in the spirit of things.  Would reccommend for a Christmas eve dinner out or what not.    My favorite dishes:  the calamari appetizer, the calamari linguini, and the sausage and bell peppers!  Yum!

I've been going to Judy's for about a year now and I like it.  The front office staff is friendly and the office is clean.  I have only gone to Judy's for their eyeborw waxing services and overall that has been an enjoyable experience, as enjoyable as it can me.  The prices are fair as well.  The only complaint I have is that the last time I saw Judy I had an awkward exchange of words with her, she had to tell me that my forehead is big and that my skin was oily, two things I am fully aware of and don't need reminding of :).

I have been a patron of Barro's for many years, and I can probably accredit that to their slogan, "a family tradition".  Their friendly and speedy service of their piping hot pizzas and wings, all made using fresh and high quality ingredients is likely to have you coming back time and time again.    The ambiance is exactly what you would expect from a family pizza joint, great smells, sports to watch, and a place to park your seat just in time for you to enjoy a cold brewski and some hot wings!    In my experience it is hard to find a place that does both pizza and wings well, and Barro's has you covered!  If you are looking to get both while you are here, ask the cashier if they have any combo specials to save you an extra buck or two!

This place has an old timey feel to it, I mean if you woke up here you probably wouldn't be sure what decade you were in, but it is a quality to love about it.  Come here for the good old fashioned donut and a cup of joe, and do not expect anything else.  I had the sour cream, which is an all time favorite of mine, and it did not disappoint, perfectly crusty and glazed on the outside, with a soft and tasty middle.  To drink I got a vanilla iced coffee which came out of a pre-mixed dispenser, therefore it was a lot sweeter and thicker (almost like chocolate milk) than I'm used to, but I drank it regardless because it paired well with my already bad-for-me donut.

Been a patron since '09 and will continue to be as long as I live in Tempe.  I typically get a gel mani/pedi and always leave satisfied.  Not sure of their wax and hair services, but am always pleased with my gel.    Recently I was preparing for my engagement photo session and asked the technician what color would photograph well, they were quick to offer many suggestions and recommended the perfect shade.

Great place to hang out after class/work, grab some grub, and have a drink.  Expect a lot of hipsters, smoke, and some dogs and cats.  Overall a unique atmosphere for the laid back folk and like to feel relaxed and right at home.

Came here for the driving range as the green fees are still a little steep for AZ summer golf.  It was $9 for a large bucket of balls, fairly competitive.  I came here in the evening, which was a mistake because the sun pounds on your face until it sets.  Now I known to wait until just after sunset to come, but before dark because it is not lit at night.    The putting greens were OK and the range was not overcrowded which was a nice change.  Also there were not an extensive amount of dviots making it easy to hit the ball.    Overall I enjoyed my experience here and will return.

This place is absolutely precious! If you're looking for an extravagant high tea this isn't the place, if you're looking for a Victorian cottage like feel, you've found the place!   I went to their high tea at 11AM and it was great, service was excellent (grandmother and grand daughter), the tea and sandwiches were also wonderful.   The only downfall is its a tad crowded, but it's definitely worth a try!

Chase Field is an excellent ballpark venue and the perfect place to go to escape the summer heat.  The surrounding area is very inviting and all about the dbacks, it makes it very easy to get in the spirit of baseball.   In my opnion, nearly every seat in the house is a good seat.  You are likely to be cool, have a good view, and be enveloped in the baseball spirit.    The main concourse has a large variety of food selection, from your typical game day staples to panda express, macayo's mexican kitchen, and cold stone creamery.  The upper concourse also has vareity just not as much.  Overall any experience at Chase Field is likely to be a great one!

Macayo's has been a family favorite for years!  There staff is always prompt, friendly, and courteous.  There food is nothing extroadinary, but is always consistent (you always know what you are going to get each and every time!).    They are constantly bringing back chips and salsa, where as other mexican restuarants seem to slack off a bit in this area.    Their margarita mugs are a good deal, you can bring em back each time for a $3.99 refill and then upon departure they will rinse out and bag up for you.    Overall I reccomend this place.    Side note:  I attended a rehersal dinner here and they were great!

Fairly good breakfast place in the valley.  Just a warning, it is typically very busy so plan to arrive early to avoid large crowds and long waits.  They do their best to get you in though!    All the food is excellent!  The menu is a large array of breakfast favorite, southwestern renditions, and some unique items as well.    Staff is friendly and attentive.  Would highly recommend to anyone, better than Denny's or IHOP.

While the overall experience was fairly decent, there were parts that were strange.  We originally were planned to go on a Saturday morning, having to meet at Deer Valley Airport at 5:15 am, but that trip was cancelled due to wind.  Therefore we rescheduled, that rescheduling was not a problem, just an inconvenience.    We ended up going the following Saturday.  Again we had to wake up bright and early to meet at 5:15 and then headed in a 15 passenger van to the launch location.  Once at the launch location we waited for the balloon to fill up and boom, lift off, and we were up and away!    There were 12 of us in the basket, including the pilot, which was pretty cramped, there was not enough room for everyone to look out, so my boyfriend and I had to take turns.  WEAR A HAT AND SLEEVED SHIRT, the flame is extremely hot and can cause discomfort if you are not prepared for it.  They provided hats for those of us who were not aware.    We were in flight for about 45 minutes, not a second of it was boring.  Upon landing we were supposed to be greeted with a catered breakfast, but this was unable to happen because our pilot chose to land on the wrong side of a wash and the van could not get to us.  Therefore we spend about 30 minutes wandering in the desert watching the van drive parallel to us, unable to get to us.  Finally the van got stuck in a wash, we walked over to them and they rapidly setup our breakfast, which was delicious!! Then they popped open two bottles of champagne, which was much needed.    Overall it was enjoyable, just a few hiccups along the way! :)

If you're looking for a great refreshing burger with freshly cut fries, this is the place.  I highly reccomend dining in rather than taking it to go simply because the fresh cut fries are likely to get cold and soggy quick.    If you're adventurous, try getting your burger or fries "animal-style", while it's not on the menu the employee working the register will know what you are referring to.  Animal style consists of melted cheese, special sauce, and grilled onions, simply delicious.    Another great menu option is the protein-style burgers where the bun is replaced by crisp refreshing lettuce.    Finish off your classic American meal with one of their three thick milkshakes!

Love this neighborhood spot.  Great place to go to enjoy some good food (bar foods), and drinks.  They have a wide selection of beers to choose from and are very knowledgeable about them.  The staff is super friendly and attentive.   My favorite menu item..."The Big Freaking Nachos", a delicious twist on nachos.  Made with fried wonton chips, crumbled Italian sausage, pepperoni slices, peppers, and melted cheese.  YUM!  Don't expect anything fancy in terms of ambiance, it's a hipster hang out, very eclectic.

A crunchy vegans dream restaurant!  When I became a vegetarian Pita Jungle shot up high onto my list of go-to restaurants due to their focus on freshness and health, and their plentiful amounts of vegetarian centered menu.  Don't get me wrong, they have a variety of meat and fish dishes, and of course feta cheese!  But so much of their menu can easily be turned veggie or vegan in just a snap of the fingers.    It irked me when I would visit a restaurant and have to order the same, vaguely vegetarian menu item, usually smothered with cheese.  A few months back I took the leap from vegetarian to vegan and therefore that narrowed my menu selections even further, and eliminating nearly every chain restaurant.  In replace for those restaurants I welcomed Pita Jungle with open arms and it is my new favorite ever since!    Talk about delicious fresh food, hearty portions, and wonderful customer service!  Everything my family and I have ever ordered has been completely satisfying, it is apparent each dish is made with attention to detail and is typically brought to the table by someone with a beaming smile.  Wonderful place filled with wonderful food & people!

Talk about fast!  If you are the type that appreciates a quick in and out mani/pedi then this is the place for you!   They do both mani and pedi at the same time which gets you out and on your way in nearly half the time, which I love!  But if you are looking for something more relaxing just stick to one service at a time.   Not only are the quick, but they are very precise, which has not always been my experience elsewhere.  They pay attention to details and are always willing to work with you on color, design, and other options.   Overall great establishment, just wish they weren't so stingy on the cash only tip, that is always a big turn off for me.

Every time I visit the PGA Superstore it is typically because I am in need of a new addition to my golf game, I know that they will not only have what I'm looking for, but will have plenty of options for me to choose from!    On this visit I needed a club re-shafted and re-gripped due to an angry outburst on the course.  This was the first time I had visited their repair desk ,and the gentleman helping me was very friendly, informative, and knowledgeable.  He was clear about the pricing, my options, and when I could expect to pick up my club.  Their pricing is fair in comparison with small golf shops in the valley and I was happy to give them my business.

After eating at Big Fat Greek restuarants numerous times prior to dining here, I thought I would give this "express" a try.  Unfortunately it could not even compare to a big fat greek restuarant and had me regretting my decision as soon as I got my food.  The atmosphere was sketchy and the food not quality.  I will not be returning to this establishment and would not reccomend it to others if you're looking for anything remotely close to BFG restaurants.

Loved this place!  I don't go to laundromats often so I was a bit clueless upon entering, but the staff was extremely helpful and friendly.    They have a wide selection and number of machines along with deep basin sinks for hand washing items, vending machines with all the laundry supplies you could need, vending machines for refreshments, and movies playing all around the place.   The entire laundromat was extremely clean and welcoming.  I would highly recommend to anyone!

I would definitely consider myself a regular at Aloha.  My boyfriend and I have been going since we moved to Tempe not just for the yogurt but the outstanding cutomer service as well.  The only employee typically at the counter is also the owner, he is so friendly and makes you feel at home.  He also will bring his dog with him to work to greet the customers outside, a nice touch as an animal lover myself.  Overall the yogurt is great, they are always coming out with new interesting flavors, evening making Milkbone yogurt for dogs.  I highyl reccommend this place to anyone, especially on Thursday evenings, BOGO!

I've been a returning customer of great clips consistently for about 2 years for a reason. When looking for a hair cut I like to be in and out and their online check in makes that possible, love walking in and skipping ahead of everyone waiting!  Also I went here to get my hair styled for my engagement pictures and Daisy did a wonderful job!  Who knew?!

Came in the other day and was treated very poorly from the start, as if I was interrupting their day.  Was tempted to turn around and walk out right then and there.  They hurriedly sorted through the items I needed shipped and treated me as if I had three heads for wanting to ship simple gifts back to family in Kansas.  By the time it was all said and done I left wronged by the lack of customer service and ripped off.  Will be seeking out shipping elsewhere going forward.

Love love love this place!  Originally got hooked at the Tempe location while attending ASU and have been big fans ever since.  My husband and I especially love their take on the classic New York style pizza.  We don't dine in often, but enjoy their easy online ordering particularly on those nights when we are on our way home from work and don't have anything in the house.  If you're a wing lover then you gotta try their golden sauce, it is delicious (and great for dipping your pizza into too!).

Yikes! I am torn because my brows are now on point, but boy oh boy was my experience strange!   I LOVE European wax center, especially their wax and the fact that they are typically consistent across the entire brand.  I have been to several locations and have been equally satisfied until my last few experiences at this location.  It is the nearest to my house, therefore it's most convenient, but I'll most likely be going out of my way to avoid it now.   The front desk staff is highly unprofessional and off putting.  Today while visiting I was their first guest upon opening at 10 AM and they were still applying their makeup and eating a full breakfast of pancakes, bacon, and fruit...really?!?! "Sorry to bother you, but I'm here to check in to my appointment..." I can't even sympathize with the fact that it was a Sunday morning...it was 10 AM!!! You can't pull it together by then?!   Next my waxer, after a few minutes of chit-chatting told me I would probably like a Brazilian wax, mind you I was there for my brows & lips, then proceeded to show me her own "business" to show her regrowth.  Wow! Thanks, but no thanks. I'm all for girl time, chit-chat, and waxing insight, but I don't need to know your business, especially after just a few minutes of meeting you!   While my waxing was great, it's all the quirky and inappropriate staff that make me running for the door.  Save me!

Always very satisfied when I come here.  Great friendly and speedy service, best to come during non-peak hours as there is often a crowd waiting. They have a nice beer selection which I appreciate, great Italian style menu selection, and good atmosphere.  No complaints here!  Dishes I highly recommend: ALL OF THEM!

Casa Ramos is amazing!  The best mexican restuarant I have been to in the valley and I have been to a lot!  Their service is superb, food is great, and the value is the best!  Would highly reccomend to anyone looking for the best bang for their buck!  Also, if you are ever in the Heber area, check them out up there too!

This spot is my go to Dunkin since its nearby my home and on the way to mostly everything.  Very pleased with its location, additionally the dining area is typically kept very clean and their outside seating is perfect for beautiful days.  Now in regard to the service and product, it continues to be a work in progress, but they seem to be getting better.  A year ago this would have been a very different post, but as of late they seem to be figuring things out and are more and more consistent.  I typically experience speedier and friendlier service in the drive thru than inside so I try to skip going in all together.  Overall, keep up whatever you're doing!

ONE STOP SHOP!  This place is fantastic if you have ANY need in your kitchen.  No membership required, huge selection of kitchen goods and accessories, and friendly staff.  I am not a restaurant owner, just a girl who likes to host dinner parties, and now that I've been here once, I know I will be returning.  I recently visited because I was hosting a seafood boil and was in search of those cute little oyster forks.  I had tried a few stores and only came across the plastic appetizer size, I wanted something more elegant and BINGO!  Not only did they have them, but they had many varieties to choose from and at a very reasonable price!  This store is like the Home Depot for cooks & chefs, and it is about the size too.  Be prepared to be overwhelmed by its vast amount of aisles and eye-candy for cooks of all sorts.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this place and highly recommend to anyone looking for those hard to find kitchen gadgets and doo-dads.

This is such a chill & laid back taco shop for the casual Mexican food diner.  This spot has everything I like in a restaurant:  simple menu, great value, and speedy service.  The ambiance is much align with the name, you get the feel like you are at someone's home which is always conducive to a good time.  I've been here for lunch and dinner and I always leave satisfied.  I recently stopped eating meat and find that the cheese quesadilla with the cabbage mix, or the vegetarian loco potato suffice as great meals.

What is there to not love about Sprouts?!  I truly enjoy my experience every time I visit here, and while I do not do my weekly grocery shopping here, what draws me in is the quality and fair priced produce, delicious deli options, and most importantly, their tasty and bang-for-your-buck custom made sandwiches!

My belly is full and my wallet is happy, but there are a few tweaks I would make to convert fired pie to a 5 star fast casual spot.  Things I loved: easy to read menu, variety of toppings, ease of ordering & check out, and the pizza of course! Perfect size too!  Things I didn't love: no vegan cheese, tad unevenly cooked pizza (one side was pretty burnt & crunchy), also unkept dining room.   One factor that makes me prefer their competitor, my pie, is that they not only have vegan cheese, but have a vegan pizza on their menu!  Also they have wheat crust which is an added bonus.

My pie is MY favorite of these new pizza concepts that are popping up everywhere!   First of all, as a vegan who finds it tremendously hard to eat out, and enjoy pizza like most others do, I LOVE that My Pie has vegan cheese!  Added bonus they have a vegan predesigned pizza on their menu! Love their mindfulness!   Also like the fact that they have a choice of white or wheat crust, added bonus!  Their selections of sauces and toppings are on point and their salads & cookies look as tasty as their pizzas!    Wonderfully satisfied with my experiences here each and every time!

Most enthusiastic service I have ever received! Those who work there are passionate about their food and are proud to serve it to you which made me so excited to try it!   We ordered the falafels, hummus, and gyro, all delicious! The falafels were freshly made and came out piping hot with a perfectly made tahini sauce.  The hummus was also freshly made and served with homemade pita bread.  I don't eat meat so I can't speak for my husbands gyro, but he nearly inhaled it!    Can't wait to come back!

I'm sure I am joined by many others when I say I came into this spot due to my familiarity and satisfaction with Boulders on Broadway.  While it appears to be slightly more upscale and has an open feel, it is consist with the Broadway location in regard to menu, beer, and customer service.    On one of my earlier visits I came in because I had a Groupon and it just so happened to be Trivia Night (Thursdays at 6:30)!  While I am not an avid bar trivia attendee, I do love my Jeopardy so I was happy to join in and play!  Also that night they had Prescott Brewery in the house promoting their beer and passing out sample for those in the bar.  Give me trivia and give me beer, it's a good night!  Spicy fried pickles too?!  Perfect!  While their service tends to be on the slower end, everyone there is extremely friendly, and helpful!  I highly recommend coming in for their happy hour due to some great app deals and stick around for dinner, trivia, or karaoke (Wednesdays, I believe)!  Great hangout spot!
