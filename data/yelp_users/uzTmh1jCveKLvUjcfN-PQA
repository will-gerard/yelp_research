This place is good, and it has a nice vibe to it. Very laid back. I just wish it was open longer... but that's not really a big issue especially now.   The food was good, each time I ordered the Fish and Chips and my signature "Sex on the beach" my drink was super good! I had about four of them and could have kept on going. I was on a date with my BF he recommended we go because he went with this co workers.   Service was prompt and my waiter was super nice. We were sitting on the patio and the only ones out there, but she still made sure to come out often to check on us. :)

This is truly sad... because it was a nice apartment before this all happen.   I never had a problem here. At all. If anything broke Frank came... and we never hassled him too much because things rarely broke. I had a parking situation with another tenant but that's another story. The parking spaces are VERY close so it can be a problem if people DON'T know how to park.  The problem came in when my apartment flooded... because the apartment above me flooded. She has about 2-3 inches of water and RIGHT before I went to bed one night it started... my smoke detector kept going off, and it was super annoying so I told my BF to take it down and we can call Frank in the morning. As soon as he took it down water started to come through it... that was already a huge sign and I no longer felt comfortable sleeping that night... but I was still going to try because I had to work the next morning. Soon after others started going off around the house and actually started to leak... I then called the hotline to get Frank out because something was seriously wrong and I didn't feel safe. No one would answer the hotline, I got nervous because by this time my whole apartment was leaking through whatever it could get through everything except my room and bathroom was leaking. It was so bad that bubbles started forming in my walls... anyway I called the fire department and they saw it said there was nothing they could do but we should try to call the hotline like we didn't do that before... the went upstairs to check the apartment above because we all figured it was something upstairs. They banged on the door and she came to the door, apparently she was sleeping but her living room was a mess! The fire department told me it wasn't safe to stay in my apartment that night. I knew by this time I wasn't going to get any sleep nor work tomorrow. Frank FINALLY came with some big vaccum and basically tried to blame her for the problem and vaccumed her apartment. I asked him to call the manager Joyce and he basically WOULDN'T! We then decided that we will stay at a hotel until tomorrow which is what we did. The next day she basically tried to refuse to give me another apartment saying that we needed to wait til ours was fixed again, but we went back before we talked to her and it was horrible the smell was bad and I started reading reviews online saying that the whole complex has leakage problems! I even read deeper and it just turned into a nightmare. I had to threaten to call the state before she gave me a new apartment. And get this it's smaller! But I STILL paid the same rent! She made me sign another lease for my last month and that was that. I was never late with rent, always kept to myself no problems and this is what I get. I would advise against this apartment but if it's last resort make SURE you have renters insurance and that you understand your apartment MAY flood.

This place is so romantic! I went here twice. Once on a spur of the moment type deal with me and my boyfriend, then again on Valentine's Day (prices go way up on Valentine's Day, but food stays the same quality) It is good! I love french cuisine so this place was up my alley.  It's not a place you eat at everyday but when you do you understand why it's such a treat. It is BYOW we found out when we got there the first time, a nice couple offered to give us their's as they brought two but my BF when down the street and got the kind we like. I'm a Moscato girl when I do drink wine. It's good that if you forget you can always run down to that big liquor store and get some. :)   I got the fish, my BF got the lamb (each time) appetizer was Brie and camelized fruit which was pretty much my favorite part. I don't really remember dessert but I know i had it and it was a sort of tart. All in all this place is good... the environment is what gives it everything though. Very cozy and romantic, I don't think it's a good place for kids... but I have none so I really don't know.

I don't really give five stars but it SAYS as good as it gets... which is true because the Chinese American food in Phoenix is wack. Very tasteless and the rice is disgusting at most places. BUT THIS PLACE?! It takes me back to St. Louis (my hometown) it's not as good but its good for being in Phoenix. I know good Chinese food and this is IT. If you live close... and even if you don't I think it's worth the drive if your craving it enough. It's extremely ghetto. A true hole in the wall PLEASE do not expect much when you go here. It's the results when your eating that are worth it. If you go off an establishment by looks then this place may not be for you. But if you can get past the looks I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I ordered the shrimp fried rice and regular wings each time. I ALWAYS call ahead, and they usually have my food ready when I get there. Again it is a true hole in the wall so don't be alarmed. But its cheap and it's good.   Oh and I am SURE it's cash only. It just doesn't seem like a place with a CC machine.

It's funny that I choose this place to be the first place I review. This is actually the place I had my first date with the guy I'm with now. We both ordered the Club sandwich and sat on the patio. It was hot that day, and I was very new to Phoenix, I actually wasn't living here yet. Anyway we sat on the patio and it was nice, a couple of drunk people (a man and a woman) started to get into it. He called her a horrible name and she got very upset. The manager came out very fast and handled it and then came to use and offered us a round on the house for the situation. HE DIDN'T have to do that but he did, and it was awesome. I have been a fan of this place ever since, I love this particular location it's always nice and lively and the food is always good. We have even gotten a few other people on the place. Oh and they serve one of the Best "Sex On The Beaches" I have ever had. So I mostly come here for drinks, but what's better than good drinks and good food with baseball on the TV? All in all I love this place, would give it a five star but the location on Bell is horrible so that effects how I rate them in general.

This is actually the only Mexican place I have been to in Phoenix. Partly because I love this place so much I wouldn't want to find another place. Partly because I fear I won't find another good place I like.   My BF introduced me to this place (as he introduced me to everything in Phoenix) him and co workers would come here sometimes. It is very good. I have no complaints. I love the setting, the food and the good service! I swear the drink/chip server comes along SO often! He is on top of it ALL the time! Never had a problem with service... one time salt was actually in my margarita (which is weird because I brought a friend here and the same thing happen to her so I'm not sure if they make them like that) but it was fixed pronto.   The food is good, I am very confident in trying different things on their menu because I have never had anything bad. This is VERY RARE for me. I usually get the same thing when I go to a place more than once.   I lived in San Antonio for several years so I know good Mexican food, and this place is pretty comparable. :)

I freakin LOVE this place! I am not a huge smoker but I love the references... I almost died laughing at the ice cube reference... I am corny. I know.  The sandwich was good, I also got a brownie. I'm not a sandwich person so I couldn't go into detail about it but I do know it was good. My BF introduced me to this place because he used to eat here when he was at ASU.   Great place!

This place has a really good happy hour! And the drinks are good. On the weekends it can get a little crowded but that's ok because I love the drinks. I also am a fan of the brownie!!! Like I usually always order that by the end of the night. I used to go in there very often so they knew me, but I don't live in Phoenix anymore so I don't go. But I would recommend this place even though it's on Mill and I hate Mill. This place is a good spot for drinks and relax mingling.

Back when I did a stint as a pescetarian  (I did four months) I went to this place, it was good meaning the food.   What I didn't like was how crowded this place was and how children were just screaming from left to right. (side note: I'm a tolerant person around kids even though I have none) but this was over the top. Basically the tables were so close you actually were sitting with other people eating with them, and that made me awkward.   None the less I never went back.. but I still gave it a four star because overall the food was really good and they had a ton of good choices to choose from. :)

I really don't see what the hype is about these cupcakes. Maybe they are better in Beverly Hills... i honestly don't know. I DO know the Scottsdale locations is overrated and the cupcakes aren't good. It's a pretty spot but I obviously don't spend almost 50 bucks on 12 cupcakes for the look of the place.   The only person who liked the cupcakes was my dog. He has the doggy treats... but then again he is a garbage disposal and will eat anything so he is kinda biased.   When I went in to pick my cupcakes there was a fly in the cupcake area... just flying around and sitting on most of the cupcakes. I informed her about it and she just threw one away and I'm basically looking like what about the others... (I feel sorry for the next person who came in)   That place cost too much money to have flies flying around on the cupcakes and they not be sanitary enough to throw them out and make all knew batches.   To top it off the cupcakes were gross, and we ended up wasting half the dozen. I obviously don't eat cupcakes for them to be bitter. If I'm going to intake the calories it better be sweet and heaven like.   In conclusion I just don't understand why people are flipping their wigs over these cupcakes. :(

Ok!   I actually used to work in the office but I swear I am not baised! (Even though I did get free brownies, and 50 percent off)   These are some GOOD brownies. So good I was addicted, I always wanted a toffee brownie. I sent some to my grandparents as a gift they loved the packaging! I love these brownies because they are Kosher Dairy. If you actually go into their bakery (which is also where the office is, we just work upstairs) you MIGHT see them mixing a batch up and see just HOW much butter they use because there is a series of glass windows. :)   I used to show up to work and smell brownies baking it just made my morning God forbid I took the bakery entrance! I love how fudgy these brownies are!   They are a great gift to send to someone (especially if you don't know how to bake like me)   ALSO the owners of the company are SOOOOOOOOOOOO nice. The reason the brownies are Kosher is because David (one of the owners) is Jewish. Eileen and David are super nice!   BONUS points for the theme color being purple!

Yes! I am giving it a 1 star.   I think I am a bit biased though because I have had Sweetie Pie's (being as I'm from STL) so I know good soul food PLUS my aunt owns a bakery and is a awesome cook when it comes to southern food.   This place? Absolutely NOT! The meals should NOT be 15 a plate.. it's not worth it at all. People always put this place on a high pedal stool and I don't know why. Me and my BF decided to try this place on a whim and I was greatly disappointed. I got the smothered pork chops... cold, bland, and looked old. Let's not even get on the corn bread... super dry! I seriously don't think this place is worth 15 bucks a plate.    On the other hand Lo Lo's (DOWNTOWN location) it's GOOD! So good when my cousin was in town for a day I suggested this place of ALL places I know. And she is a harsh critic but she approved! I know for a fact she would not approve of this place. Neither do I.   Thing is... this place is owned by Ms. White and Lo Lo's is owned by I think her grandson or something so you would THINK the food and the way it taste would kinda coincide.

I hate this Wal Mart. It's so ghetto. You can tell when people get their government assistance because you are more prone to see carts FULL of groceries at that time. Not that it is a problem who receives what, but the environment of this Wal Mart sucks. I live the closest to this Wal Mart though so I must deal. Most of the time I go to Target but there are times where I used to come here. EVERY TIME I used to come someone asked me in the parking lot if I wanted to buy tamales. Like EVERY TIME! It annoyed the shit out of me because I would usually be coming out with my items. So obviously I wouldn't want your tamales when I am sure if I wanted some I could get them from a restaurant or maybe even from inside. Another thing is people standing at the front one particular guy says he is an "aspiring" artist and when I ignored him as I was walking out he played the race card saying we are both African American and we should support each other. Wal Mart shouldn't allow people to be soliciting outside the store UNLESS they are selling girl scout cookies.  I did love to get my watermelon from here though it's cheap huge and super sweet!   All Wal Marts are not created equal... I have been to some very nice ones... out in Gilbert/Chandler area.

I used to LOVE this bar! They remodeled it from when I used to go. When I first started dating my BF and was new to Phoenix we used to go here a lot. The bartenders here were great! And they knew how to mix a drink! Especially the Asian woman, she was super nice and mixed one of the best sex on the beaches I have ever had! Kept me coming back, I also used to love the vibe of the bar, sometimes it got loud most of the time it was laid back during the summers since ASU students were probably back home.  I did have a particular incident which made me stop going so much when a fellow customer called me a "colored girl". I won't say he was racist nor will I say it was the bars fault because honestly he was hassling the bartender also. He was too drunk and talking out of the side of his neck, and his friend with him bless his heart.... but I didn't particular LIKE being in an environment where I was being offended and yet paying the same amount as the next guy.   All in all this bar is good and well! I miss coming here, but I no longer live in Phoenix anymore so it's a thing of the past, but if your looking to stray off Mill this wouldn't be a bad place to come!

They get bonus points because they know how to do a proper CLAW NAIL. I stumbled upon this place simply due to the fact that I went the day before to get my nails done somewhere else and they turned out HORRIBLE. She did not know how to do claws and instead of just saying so she attempted and failed and I was left to pay for something that looked HORRIBLE. Mind you it was MUCH more expensive than this place. When I came here he took them off and gave me what I much so wanted. I LOVED them! They aren't hard to maintain either and you can still get things done... except for typing on a PC that was bit of a challenge.. but no problem typing on my Macbook. Anyway the service is good, I recommend going early in the morning and not on the weekends. They have good service and the prices aren't very high. She even waxed my eyebrows and she did a good job! BONUS POINTS because she filled them in for me after wards! I don't wear acrylics anymore and I don't live in Phoenix so I don't go anymore but I do recommend this place if you don't live too far.  Four stars because one first impression the english barrier is real.

If you get a table here (like I did) don't. It was my birthday weekend, and a friend wanted to go here, so I was down. I had never been. I'm always up for trying new things. We both agreed to split the table. I was quoted on the phone 500 dollars, cool we put in our 250 and couple nights later I arrived. It was seriously NOT what I expected. I got there before everyone else, if you get a table you have to be there before I think 11pm or midnight. Ok so here is where things get weird. So I go in it's me and my BF, and on the phone the guy told me you get to bring 8 people with the table. So another friend shows up, I go get here and we are at 3 (you are included in the 8) another friend shows up and she brings 3 people with her... at the time they told me 2 people will have to pay because you only get 4-5 people with the table... please forgive me as I had a ton to drive that night so I'm going off estimate. I told the lady that one the phone he told me 8... we went back and forth.. all I remember is walking off because she was getting on my nerves and it was my birthday weekend. Anyway so they bring us the liquor with the girls and blah blah blah, and I really started to drink up. The vibe was WEIRD. I am going to be totally honest and blunt at this point. It was very ghetto, and for sure not what I am used to. I don't do these types of clubs. My friend recommended it to me, but I also have to remember she recommended I go to Pink Rhino and I did and it was as ratchet and ghetto as ever! I didn't know but about 2 songs at this club. I don't listen to hip hop like that outside of commercial or the stuff I may here such as Drake... and 2 chainz. I'm not a true hip hop fan so I can't tell you what's hot all I know is it was tons of black people and hip hop music. I am not prejudice! I am black myself, BUT I prefer a mix crowd, or a crowd where the music is TOP 40... Britney Spears, Rihanna, Katy Perry... Maroon 5, Fun, and just more pop. So yeah didn't like that but I was drunk and ready to have a good time anyway. If you have a table getting to the bathroom is a CHALLENGE and a HALF. You must walk through the crowd... then into a line as they have a few bathrooms and everyone uses it men and women. At the end of the night they charge you an extra 100 bucks for the tip... the girls did nothing... I just had two full bottles... and yeah it just wasn't my style for the amount we paid. I'm not going back ever. I didn't like how ratchet it was.

I LOVE frozen yogurt! Such a sweet treat!   What I DON'T like it watered down yogurt! *cough cough* (Mojo on Mill Ave)  This place is really good and the yogurt isn't watered down. I used to live out this way so I would come here often especially since it was open til midnight on weekends!  I love the variety of topping they have, cheesecake!!!!!! That is a topping I usually don't see at Yogurt shops.   It can be a bit of a wait during certain times, but that didn't bother me. :)

I love cupcakes! I don't know who doesn't honestly... I am always down to try a cupcake shop at least once! Unlike Sprinkles this place did not fail! I love how big the cupcakes are, the first one I ever tried was the Salted Caramel one and it was super good! I had done all my shopping and I walked past the kiosk by the garages. So I stopped and every since then... I have been hooked.   I got some of these cupcakes for my boyfriend's birthday he loved them too! :)

What can I say I'm a beauty junkie! And Sephora is my first stop. I love that they have many brands. So I can try out different brands out there... more of a variety. I also like that it looks like make up heaven would look like. I can NEVER pass a Sephora and not go in no matter if I don't intend to buy anything I ALWAYS go in. I more so like this store because they don't hassle me when I go in like Ulta... Ulta makes me feel so uncomfortable shopping there, as they hassle me with multiple "are you doing ok?, can I help you?" Sephora doesn't do that especially this one particular. They are super nice, and cool and eager to help when YOU need it. I never really need help though because I am a beauty junkie so I know most of the products when when I do need some help they are always there... and somewhat knowledgeable. I say that because there are so many brands and even they have told me it's hard to remember all or even know whats actually in the store. But they try and that's what counts the most to me. I spend a lot of money in Sephora alone so I expect a certain amount of service and I never had any problems here.   As a tip: I would recommend going on the website and writing what you like down.   I also love that I don't have to walk too far to MAC after I'm done with Sephora and vice verse!

Absolutely NOT!   This place is disguisting and I am not just talking about the food. The environment was so gross that I actually ended up NOT eating my Pho!   I went and there were literally two people in there, and yet their were dishes sitting on tables, and behind the section where you go to the restroom. Flies flying around, it was just nasty!  Let's not even get to the restroom. I ended up not using it because it was so nasty.   When you order a drink, it's a can and no refills for 1.75..... They serve nasty tap water, with no lemon or anything. It was just a hot ass mess. For the amount I paid and what I DIDN'T eat... and I didn't even bother telling the guy I wasn't happy because it would have just ended with me leaving even more unhappy.   Moral od the story is... don't go here. I seriously wish I would have taken pictures!!!!
