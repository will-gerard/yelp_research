Management at this location is terrible. How could you be a nationwide chain and not have capability to void a receipt so that I could adequately tip your employee.?!

The hostess didn't ask us where we wanted to sit and forgot to set our table. Our waitress was very good but seemed to be too busy. They need better management to train their people to work as a team. The host staff should have been helping in other areas. Other than that the food was good but it would have been nice to get some warm complimentary bread. I had to ask multiple times for the bread and when we did finally get some it was cold and slightly stale.

I love Echo's coffee so much better than Starbucks or Coffee Bean. It just tastes better.

Kudos to the omelette maker and the waitress! However, I'm not sure why it was so difficult for four hostesses to find me a decent table.   Overall the food was okay, not that great of a selection for $30 per person though......the bread table had a great display, but was inevitably just there for looks and stale.   I'm a vegetarian and tend to look for healthier options like fruit and a nice salad bar which was not offered.  I don't recommend this place at all. The cigarette smell from the casino seriously kills the appetite.

Sochu House serves the best Thai food I have had in a long time. To start we had the truffle edamame which was my main reason for going. I haven't seen this dish since vacationing in Hawaii and it was rediculously good.  For an entree I had this creamy coconut tofu dish which was savory and equally as tasty as the edamame. They have taken Thai to a new level with their Neo-Asian Fusion cooking.  We sat in the dining room, but I can't wait to go back to this place for Happy Hour. The lighting and decor in the bar area creates an extemely intimate and romantic setting for a date or chatting with friends.
