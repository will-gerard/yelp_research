I took my two children here after going to the museum on a Saturday afternoon.  I ordered a fruit plate to start with and then we were going to share a hamburger.  She asked how I'd like it cooked and I said "medium".    When my fruit plate was dropped off by another person, no silverware or napkins were left.  We started eating the fruit with our fingers.  The waitress walked by and saw us.  I assumed she was going to get silverware.  But then I didn't see her again until she brought the hamburger.  There were so many things wrong at this time.  First, the fact that I had to ask for silverware and napkins in a restaurant is absurd.  Especially seeing that I have 2 children under the age of 4.  I obviuosly need napkins!  But the hamburger was WELL done and absolutely tasteless.  There was nothing on it.  I had to ask for mustard.  When I ordered the hamburger I told her it was for us 3 to split.  She just brought over the hamburger on one plate with no extras.  I had to cut the hamburger into pieces and tear one of our drink napkins to put the burgers on for my kids. At this point I was so annoyed and tired and wanted to leave.  I asked for the check when she finally walked by a few minutes later (she never came by to ask how anything was).  I didn't even want to bother complaining and waiting to get more food.  After a long day, I just wanted to leave.  But I would never come back again.

I wanted to stop by here while I was walking around downtown Phoenix.  I came in just as a Diamondbacks game was finishing.  It was DEAD inside.  I sat at the bar and ordered water and a margarita.  It was the worst margarita I've ever had.  There was so much strawberry syrup and it was so sweet that I only drank a few sips, finished my water, and left.

This makes waiting in line for Pizzeria Bianco to open worth while!  I haven't ever sat inside, but it looks really cute!  I love that they serve cider, since I'm not a wine or beer drinker.  The cider is pretty good, but very large!  I almost wish it were smaller because it gets warm by the time I get towards the end of it because I'm a slower drinker.  It also warms up quickly sitting outside in line waiting for the restaurant to open.  The servers have always been pleasant and I would definitely recommend this place!

Loved coming here for a recent Yelp event!  I haven't been here in a few years.  It's definitely a museum for older kids, so my little ones won't be visiting here for a few years.  I was able to finally visit Body Works.  What an interesting exhibit!!  I have only heard good things about it.  I, personally, had a bit of a reaction to it, but it was very interesting.  I just couldn't get over the fact that these bodies once were mothers and fathers or children.  It was particularly hard for me to see the babies and development of a fetus.  I'm glad I went, but I don't know if I would go again.  It was a bit sad for me to see.  I think this is a good museum, but since I grew up in Chicago, I am used to bigger and better museums.  I wish we had more here, but it is a good place for older kids.

My new favorite store!!  I noticed that my Nikon D40x was getting dirty and needed to get cleaned.  I called around to a couple places and found it to be $95 for a cleaning.  When I called Photomark (that I've only heard good things about in the past), they told me it was $45!  Big difference!  I really needed it done on short notice and was kind of bummed when he said it would take a few days.  He heard the tone of my voice and asked me if I needed it soon and said he would rush it and have it done the next day.  Jay is awesome!!    I'm pretty amateur and I was kind of intimidated walking in and talking to someone about the camera.  But Jay was so easy to talk to.  He didn't talk down to me like I was an idiot.  He didn't talk over my head about things.  He was so easy to understand and he explained everything to me.  I also purchased a speedlight while I was there and the sales staff was awesome.  I had my two loud toddlers with me and he was laughing while they ran around with me yelling at them not to touch ANYTHING!!  I love that they hold classes here.  I am planning on attending two of them.  I can't wait!!!

We came here on a Saturday during Restaurant Week.  The service was excellent and very professional.  We received our orders quickly and everything was prepared exactly how we ordered it.  I ordered the salad with goat cheese and pears.  It was good.  Not great, but I ate the whole thing so I definitely can't complain!  The goat cheese was delicious and creamy.  For my entree, I ordered the beef tenderloin.  It was also delicious!  It came with a small portion of scalloped potatoes, a few green beans, and a few asparagus.  For me it was a perfect portion size, but for anyone else I think it may have been a bit small.  But since it's on the special "Restaurant Week" menu, I'm sure the portions are meant to be smaller.  For dessert, I ordered the creme brulee.  It was delicious as well!  The waiter also brought out a chocolate cake/lava cake?  Not sure what it was but it was yummy and served with an ice cream that was very light.  Almost seemed like whipped cream, but it was definitely ice cream.  OHHH!!  I almost forgot about the bread!  I loved, loved, loved it!  The butter is the best!  I couldn't quite figure out what is in the butter.  It almost tastes like a cream cheese.  It was wonderful!  Overall, everything was good but I don't know if I'd ever rush back.  I have other places I like more, but this was a good restaurant.  I would definitely recommend it to others!

I have been going to Dr. Goodwin for about a year or so and I recommend him to everyone I know!  I live up near Anthem, but make the drive down to him because he really is the best!  He is always kind and patient, which is a huge thing for me.  I used to hate going to the dentist because of the pain AND the huge bills, but Dr. Goodwin is always great!  I don't feel like he ever tries to "upsell" me and have me get extra things done that aren't needed. I have started taking my two kids there (ages 8 and 10) and they actually LOVE going now!   Not only is Dr. Goodwin a great dentist, but I absolutely love the dental hygienists and the front office staff!  They are so welcoming and I love talking to them! I highly recommend Dr. Goodwin!!

As far as a McDonald's goes, this place is always pretty quick and efficient!  I come here pretty often for coffee in the mornings.  The lady in the drive-thru knows me and is super friendly!  They are always fast!  I've only had a few instances where there's been a bit too much cream or something in my coffee where it had to be thrown out.  More often it's done perfectly!  And with the new remodel, it looks great!

First and last time here.   First, it was dirty and dingy inside.  I felt dirty just sitting down. Next, we had a vulgar couple of people sitting at a table a few feet away.  They were talking so loudly and about such inappropriate things while I was sitting with my 2 young daughters clearly hearing everything they were saying.  The food was so bad that my daughters ate one bite of cheeseburger and one bite of grilled cheese, and said they were done and would eat again when they got home.  I wish the waitress would have noticed and asked, but oh well.   We won't ever be back.

I do like Albertsons more than some other grocery stores.  Definitely much better produce and meat than going to Super Wal-Mart!  I'm always able to find everything I need for my recipes and the produce is always fresh.  My one complaint is the bathroom.  I usually shop with small children, so I use the restrooms there quite a bit.  It's always kind of yucky, but I guess all grocery store bathrooms are.

I love this place!  I love how clean and organized the store is.  Normally stores like this are a complete mess and I feel like I'm browsing through someone's messy closet.  The quality of clothing is still great with prices that are more affordable.  There are a ton of styles to choose from and they constantly get new merchandise in.  Love it!

The waitstaff is the rudest I have ever encountered.  They asked us to move to a smaller table--right next to the wall in front of the kitchen.  Kind of gross.  Then they took forever to bring us our drink order.  Another couple came in and tried sitting down at a 4-top table, and they asked them to move as well.  The couple didn't argue, just left.  The two waitresses came back by the kitchen, right in front of our table, and complained and complained about that couple and other patrons.  They were extremely unprofessional.  They were not trying to talk quietly between themselves.  They didn't like that people wanted to sit and read a newspaper on a Sunday morning.  They were more concerned with filling the restaurant.  I would never return to this place again.  Very rude.

I just received an email from the owners saying they just read my review and they are sorry and hope that I'll give JP Pancake another chance since they have new waitstaff.  I thought that was nice of them and I seriously thought about going back.  Then I wanted to read my review again since it's been over 6 months.  That's when I noticed that the same owner that wrote to me also is someone who wrote a "stunning" review giving JP Pancake 5 stars.  (A.B.   also known as Amber and Chad Dahl who own JP Pancake)  Now I'm sure it is not against the rules to write a review for yourself, but I kind of think that's like voting for yourself for Homecoming Queen.  I just don't think that's right!  It throws off the ratings of everyone else who is judging your restaurant.  I think it's kind of scummy that they did that.  Now I definitely will not return to this dirty, dingy place.   :(

I always order a cinnamon-raisin bagel toasted with butter, and every time I always complain that I wish there were more raisins in it!    It seems like at least half of my bites are just dough, no raisins.  But that is the only thing I could complain about!  The service is always fast in the morning and the people who work here are super nice.  I definitely recommend it!

I enjoy it here every single time I come!  Service is always friendly and quick!  Usually when you order orange juice, it comes in a tiny cup.  Here you get a nice large glass of it!  And the pancakes are a must every single time!  Their syrup is always served warm, and it's the best syrup you can find!

This pizza is absolutely foul! I can't believe that anyone likes this place!  It's so disgusting and greasy.  I ordered sausage and it was shredded and salty.  So gross.  And what's the deal with having them on every corner?  Worse than Starbucks!  I swear there are about 3 or 4 within about 5 miles of my house on Carefree Highway!

I came here with a big group on a Friday for happy hour.  Our waitress was awful.  It took forever to get a drink, and I was only the third person to arrive and the place was still empty!  The food was okay, but I wish there was smaller options, especially for a happy hour.  The drinks too were just okay.  The real problem was with our bill.  For about 12 of us, it came out to be $800.00.  My friend and her mom split a meal.  When they brought it out on two plates, both of them started eating them.  After they were halfway done, the waitress informs them that one of those plates was actually for someone else.  Ok, fine, but that's not my friend's fault.  They should have either split up the one plate for them or not put two in front of them!  She asked the waitress to take it off the bill, and my friend was told to get out of her seat and go talk to the manager.  What?!  Then the manager told her that since she ate it, she should have to pay for it.  I have never heard someone act so rudely as a manager!  He should have easily taken the $15 off from our $800 bill!  I would never come here again.

I'm not a fan of Cowboy Ciao.  I know a lot of people love it, but I'm just not one of them.  People love the chopped salad, but I don't care for Salmon, so I don't really care for the salad.  I did like how they present it and prepare it at the table.  The appetizers were okay.  I liked the mac and cheese the most, but most of the other people at our table didn't care for it.  My boyfriend and I split the Pastrami-rubbed filet mignon.  Neither of us liked it very much.  It was completely drenched in gravy.  You couldn't even taste the steak because of the gravy taste.  We had the peanut butter brownie for dessert.  It was okay, but definitely not worthy of a "best dessert" award!  The worst thing was the acoustics in the restaurant.  We had a group of 8 and we could not hear each other talking.  You literally had to yell for the person next to you to hear you.  And I gave up trying to talk to anyone from the other end of the table.

This is one of my favorite Starbucks locations.   The baristas are always sweet and friendly.  And patient.  Twice I've come in wanting to try something new, and they have recommended new drinks for me to try.  One, I didn't care for and they tossed it for me and made me my normal frappuccino that I love for free.

I just started attending here at Christmas and I'm so glad I tried it.  I haven't been attending since I was a child because church was always so long and boring.  I actually look forward to going every week now!  The building and campus is beautiful!  The volunteers who greet you everywhere are so welcoming and friendly.  Everyone is so nice.  The services are amazing.  The first half of the service is mostly music, which sounds fantastic.  Their music is geared toward a younger generation, and looking around the service, there seem to be a huge percentage of young people here.  Pastor Don, and the others who I have heard speak, are inspirational.  They have wonderful messages that connect to me and my real life.  I don't feel like I'm being lectured like I have at other churches.  They make me want to do better in my life and be a better person.  The child center is wonderful as well.  After services every week, my girls play in the courtyard with all the toys and balls.  They really enjoy the time that we get to play together.  There is also a bookstore, food court (Starbucks!), and outdoor grill.  There are tons of TV screens for those who don't want to miss out on any of the football games that are playing.  I love coming here and I would highly recommend it to everyone!

We got there early, probably an hour and a half before they opened.  Thankfully the bar next door opens an hour before.  The time went by quickly and luckily we were the last people to be sat when they opened!  The food was absolutely delicious!  I can't wait to go again!

Update:  I have been here so many times, and I rarely have a wait.  I hear from people that have never been here before that they don't want to wait 4 hours for a table.    I just went this last Friday at 6pm and there was NO WAIT!    I honestly can't think of a time I waited more than 10 minutes for a table!  Some times I'm actually sad that there is no wait because I do want to go over to Bar Bianco and hang out for a bit before going to dinner!  :-)

I'm always up for going to AZ88!!  This place has been around forever, but I love it every time I come.  I always order some type of chicken dish, and lately it's been the AZ88 chicken.  I love the spicy chicken with the celery with the mayo sauce!  Yummy!  Their strawberry shortcake dessert is also delicious!  My favorite drink there is called "Celebration Champagne".  So good!!  It comes with some type of pop-rocks kind of candy that gets sprinkled in by the waiter when he delivers the drink and it fizzes up.  Love it!

I am from Chicago and this is definitely my favorite place to go for pizza here in Arizona!  I'm also a huge fan of sourdough, so it is pretty perfect for me!!!  My favorite is the thin sausage pizza.  So yummy!!!  Parking is a pain and the wait staff isn't the friendliest.  I came in yesterday with my two daughters pretty early in the evening.  Our waitress picked up my daughters plate before she was even finished, cleaned up the entire table while we were still sitting there, and even took all the napkins.  I needed the napkins to wipe their hands after eating pizza...why would you take brand new, clean napkins away when I have two small kids with me?

I wanted to love this place, but I just can't.   There was absolutely nothing that I liked.  The waitress was rude and not very smart.  The food was not very good.  I had the lasagna, and I didn't even want to have more than a few bites before I said I was done with it.  I could make better lasagna at home.  We came for a birthday party and they brought out the cake, but didn't bring forks for about 5-10 minutes later.  I have no desire to return here.

I came here twice during my stay in June.  (This review is really late because I forgot to finish it because I started it on my phone!)  Actually three times if you count me ordering room service my first day and this being it..  The first time was excellent!  Service was fantastic, hostess was very sweet and talked to me as I came in.  She actually seemed interested in talking and listening when I told her about my stay so far.  Coffee was delicious, good food (although I didn't love the fried eggs).  The restaurant is huge inside so there was no waiting .  Loved it!  I came the next morning and got a completely different experience.  It was actually BAD.  Waiter didn't seem concerned about getting me anything in a timely fashion.  Again, the restaurant wasn't too busy, so there was no excuse.   My food was so bad and the eggs were so runny, that I had to send them back.  And I never send food back because I feel bad.... Anyhow, I sent it back (after waiting forever to get the waiter's attention and instead I got the manager's attention). My food came back a second time partially cooked more, but still runny.  I hate the runny white part in eggs over medium.  It was pretty gross.  I couldn't eat it and was starving by then, so I just ate the toast and bacon. My toast was ice cold.  The butter wouldn't even melt on it. I was told there wasn't any creamer for the coffee, and instead they brought me a cup with milk in it.  I ended up not drinking my coffee at all.  I was ready to rip this place apart....  Then I asked the waiter for the bill since he didn't seem to get the hint that I had been sitting there forever waiting for it.  And he told me the manager covered it and not to worry about it.  Fortunately for me, I didn't have any cash and couldn't even leave him a tip.  Not that he deserved a dime.  So because the manager at least had the common courtesy to cover my breakfast, I didn't give them the 1 star I had planned.... I'm not sure if I'd come here again.....I might try it once more....

I randomly came across this place here on yelp and decided to go find it on a random Friday afternoon.  When you first walk in, it just seems like endless junk.  Someone is obviously a pack rat.  But after getting past that and starting to walk around, there are so many cool little things here!  I had a look at the books, particularly the children's books, and thought they were waaay overpriced.  $3-$5 for a used kids' book seems a bit much!  The place is so big inside that I wasn't sure where I hadn't already been.  There are rooms that venture off from themselves--all stuffed with tons of knickknacks and things!  It was really warm in most rooms.  They did have fans going in each room, but being in Phoenix during the summer, I was getting a bit hot and decided to not linger much more.  One room kind of smelled like pee too.  Kind of gross.  I found a table with old newspapers, all marked for $5.00.  This is the 40th anniversary (I think it was this week) of Apollo 11 landing on the moon.  There were about 5 different AZ Republics from that date.  I bought one because I thought it would be something interesting to show my own kids as they get older!  I would definitely come again!  And the staff were very friendly, yet also didn't walk around me asking if I needed help when I was obviously just looking.

I wanted to go out for a hike and to shoot some wildflowers and thought I'd try this place.  Good thing I brought my wallet!  I wasn't expecting the $6.00 fee!  That's the only thing I didn't like about it.  At least for the money, the park ranger did point out where I would find the best flowers for pictures.    It was nice and quiet outside.  The grounds were beautiful and clean.  I also hiked the Go John trail.  I would definitely come back, but not as often as I would without the cost!

For primary teachers, this store has plenty of fun stuff that any teacher would love to buy (if they had endless amounts of money!)  But as a middle school teacher, this place is lacking.  I teach math, and the only poster I found was a perimeter & area poster.  The lady at the store told me that was all they had.  I tried to also find some new character education posters, but the only ones they had were geared towards 5 year olds with pictures of cartoon teddy bears.  I was also surprised that they didn't have any of the "motivational" type posters.  And why is this place so overpriced?  If I needed to buy post-it notes or markers, I would walk the 200 yards down to Wal-mart and buy them for probably half the price that Lakeshore sells them for.

I've lived here for about 6 months now.  I'm not positive if I want to stay or not.  I like the apartment.  It has great space and is less expensive than other apartment complexes in the area.  I also like that they have Friday night food nights and Saturday morning breakfast for free.  It's always been really good.  I don't love all the scorpions in my apartment.  Or all of the people who own motorcycles (loud motorcycles) around my building.  Or that rain comes through the windows during bad storms.  The biggest thing that I hate is that I get such bad cell service in my apartment.  I have to walk outside when I make important phone calls.  I have called AT&T to see if there is anything I can do, and there is nothing.  They think my apartment may have lead paint that is the reason I don't get service inside the walls, but once outside it's fine.

The amount of critters and bugs that I find in my apartment every week is disgusting.  Let's see...inside I have found tons of scorpions, spiders, earwigs, and even a cockroach.  Outside I had a black widow and 2 squirrels living on my patio.  The apartment complex actually charges you $5 a month for "pest control".  Although you do need to call and request a spraying (The pest control guys come out every Wednesday).  But I've requested and had no one show up twice now.  And the spray doesn't seem to do a thing so it's almost pointless to do it.  Just another $60 you are paying every year for nothing.  They should be spraying around the perimeter of every single building every week.  I lived in a house and when pest control came out, that's what they mainly did.   The other thing that I find gross is that there is not a cleaning crew to clean the pool area, especially on Saturday and Sunday mornings.  I have 2 small kids (ages 4 and 2) and I won't bring them to the pool anymore because it's disgusting.  The amount of cigarette butts laying on the ground around the pool is so gross.  They are all over the dirt areas around the trees.  The garbages are overflowing with bottles and red cups on the weekend.

I am done.  I keep trying to give them more chances.  Maybe because the rent is cheaper than elsewhere, maybe because I don't feel like packing and moving.   But I am done with their shit here.  I've always gotten along with the office staff, but I have heard plenty of complaints about them.    My last straw is the amount of noise you can hear.  These apartments have zero insulation.  I can hear my neighbors above me walking, shutting cabinets, running back and forth exercising, rolling a medicine ball.  I can hear them talking, I hear the guy calling his girlfriend a "fucking idiot" and them fighting.  I hear them "making up" after their fights.  Nice....  I have 2 kids and I was FORCED to move when I lived on the second floor.  Talus Ranch would not reimburse me for moving costs or anything when I had the neighbor below me harassing me and even at one point yelling the word "Bitch" at my daughter.  But I figured for piece of mind, I would just move to the bottom floor so I wouldn't have to worry about my kids making any noise while playing during the day and having the police called on me.  During the middle of the day.  On a Saturday.  Ridiculous.  Anyways, I moved into a different building, bottom floor.  I had 4 people living above me, 2 were small toddlers who ran around and made noise.  Not once did I complain.  When they moved out a couple moved in (my current above-me neighbors.)  They apparently are night people, wake me up when I'm sleeping, have had parties on Thursday nights, have their 2 yappy dogs left on the patio so the dogs crap out there instead of in their apartment I guess.  And not once has the office written them up.  They have woken my daughters up on school nights, and still the office doesn't want to call them to ask them to politely keep it down after 8pm.    Even though I was told I needed to have my daughters not play, run around, in the middle of the day.  I was told that there is no "quiet hours here".  All hours are quiet hours.  apparently not.  Other fun tidbits to consider if you're even thinking about moving here....  They will nickel and dime you for everything.  $$$$ for cable, even if you don't want it.  You must get it  $$$$ to pay for your rent!!  They charge you extra for sending you a paper bill.  If you opt to have no paper bill, they still charge you $1 to pay online!  How stupid!    With about 24 rent checks per building x I don't know how many buildings, at least 10 or 20, they are making an easy $240 to $480 EXTRA every single month!  Just because they want to charge for us making a payment!  $$$$ for pest control  $$$$ for garbage collection, although the garbage areas are absolutely disgusting.  Full of rodents, bugs, ants, garbage laying next to the bins BECAUSE THE BINS ARE FULL, not because people can't throw them in.  Huge furniture, beds, couches, left by garbages for MONTHS.   The office continues to do nothing about it even when I informed them that there was a couch out there 2 months ago.  It's still there...almost 4 months later.  And now has a mattress next to it that has been there for over a month.  Dog crap is everywhere!  I have a large dog.  And I clean up after him every single time.  They even have blue doggie bags for you to use and people are so incredibly lazy that they can't pick up their own dog crap.  One lazy guy actually bags up his dog's poop, but then HANGS IT from the bag container!!  Instead of just walking the 20 feet to the garbage can!  Unbelievable.  Classy people living here....   So I am not making it my personal mission to make sure everyone knows about the poor customer service of MAA.  I have complained to their corporate office more times that I can count.  Pay a little bit more and go elsewhere.  Maybe you will feel a little more valued as a customer as well.  You have been warned!

It's unfortunate that this is the only bookstore in the northern Phoenix/Deer Valley area.  The store does not seem cozy like a lot of the other Barnes & Noble and Borders Bookstores do.  I do not want to hang out here and look around.  I was also completely grossed out by the bathrooms.  There was used toliet paper all over the floor.  You could see that it hadn't been cleaned and swept in a long time.  The whole bathroom smelled like urine.  It was pretty disgusting.  I guess I will just have to drive down to Desert Ridge or Scottsdale 101.

Go anywhere else to eat!!!!  I came here during a lay over at the Charlotte Airport.  As soon as I sat down and opened the container, I regretted it.  The food just looks overprocessed and gross.  I ordered the Kung Pao chicken and rice.  They didn't even have regular white rice, only fried.  Way too heavy of a meal when you're about to sit on another airplane for another 4 hours.  The food was absolutely disgusting.  I took 2 bites and threw it away.  I can't believe I wasted $10 on this crap.    I then walked over to BK for a $1.75 cheeseburger that tasted like it came from a 5 star restaurant compared to this dump.

I'm sorry, but anyone that is complaining about paying $3.50 for a cupcake, and saying that's expensive, is crazy!!  No, I wouldn't come in here and buy a dozen or more cupcakes for a party.  I'd make them myself (or just buy the Sprinkles mix if you really want that great taste!)  But $3.50 for a dessert that is more than filling is a great price.  I can barely finish one cupcake.  They are super sweet.  The Red Velvet is my favorite!  I had never tasted Red Velvet before, so I didn't have anything to compare it to, but I have had many of their other flavors, including the basics of chocolate and vanilla, and the Red Velvet is by far the best!!  Every single time it is moist and delicious!!  I also love the Pumpkin cupcake, which I was surprised by!  I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin flavor, but this cupcake is delicious!!  I love that they have different cupcakes each day and seasonal ones as well.  Well worth the $3.50!  My favorite dessert place!

I've been here a few times with my boyfriend to watch Sunday football games.  Ick.  The place is so dark and hazy inside.  I just feel dirty being here.  The food is awful!!  I've had breakfast and lunch here.  The breakfast was the worst.  Just greasy and nasty.  The lunch (hamburger) wasn't inedible, but I've definitely had much better.  I would much prefer going to a Zipps than coming here again.

Came here twice during my Las Vegas stay...  The first time was for lunch.  I ordered a way overpriced hamburger.  It was good, but ridiculously expensive (just like everything in Vegas, I guess) Everyone in our party was amused by our asshole waiter.  I just don't get why people want to go somewhere and have some loser making fun of you.  I would go elsewhere for better food and better service.  And I ordered their expensive yard daiquiri.  DON'T BUY IT!  I didn't taste/feel any alcohol at all, after spending almost $20 on one drink.  I expect to be drunk afterwards!  What a rip off....way to spend $20 on a frozen icee.  The second time I came in at night for a drink, they were closing!  It had to have been maybe 10pm?  11pm?  They close early!  Go elsewhere!

I have to add to Andrew's review.....  I just can't believe the things that happened!!  Yes the app was good.  The entree was good too, but there were bites of just bread with no chicken in the panini.  It definitely would have been better with more chicken!  But the girl working here is one of the worst waitress/bartender/hostesses EVER!  When we walked in, she didn't even sit us.  We stood there forever waiting until she finally told us to seat ourselves.  We went outside since there was nothing left inside.  It was too hot outside so we came back in and figured we'd sit at the bar.  Luckily a nice guy noticed us looking around and let us sit at the end of his table that he moved apart since his whole party didn't show up for dinner.  I was so excited when I saw they had cider on their menu!  And not just one, but two that I like!  Wyder's Pear Cider and Strongbow!!   I ordered a Wyder's.  After I finished it and asked for another, she said they were out of them.  Okay, so I ordered a strongbow.  She came back and poured it into a glass for me.  When I took a drink it was disgusting!!  It was Boddington's!!!!  When I finally got her attention away from flirting with a man sitting at the bar to ask her for the correct drink, she told me they were out of Strongbow too!  How are you out of both drinks??  You're a restaurant.  Shouldn't it be stocked?  You're right across from a BevMo for god's sake!  When we ordered our food, he ordered the app.  Then I ordered my entree and she walked away!  She didn't even get his order!!!!  We figured it was probably for the best.  We'd split the app and the entree and eat less.  Stupid of the waitress to lose money that way, but whatever.  When she brought my food, she didn't bring the correct things.  How hard is it to remember?  She had maybe 4 tables to take care of!  Maybe if she stopped texting while she's behind the bar on her cell phone or if she'd stop having a conversation with the guy at the bar, maybe she could have done her job a little better.

I normally love Sauce, but I had the worst experience here on Memorial Day.  If that would have been the first time I ate here, I definitely wouldn't have ever returned.   I went to eat with my boyfriend around 5:30pm.  The restaurant was not busy.  However, the service was super slow.  I ordered the side of pasta shells with chicken and he ordered soup and a sandwich.  His was brought out first.  He ate slowly trying to wait for me, but after at least 10-15 minutes his food was getting cold as he waited for my simple dish to be finished.  I'm not sure why it was taking so long since it wasn't busy.  I finally went up to the manager, a lady who was walking around not doing a damn thing. (There was actually a guy in front of me complaining about how long it was taking to get his food too)  I told her that my order hadn't come out after waiting 20 minutes and that my boyfriend's food was now cold because he has been waiting to eat WITH me.  She was so flustered and said she'd find out.  She brought it to me a minute later and said she was sorry but that she couldn't control her staff.  WHAT?!?  How unprofessional!  I couldn't believe that she was blaming her kitchen staff, especially to a customer.  Maybe you shouldn't be a manager if you can't get your staff to work together.  She did offer me a slice of dessert that I took to go.  I got a slice of cheesecake.  It was awful.  Very dry.  So you would think that since I just got this dish right from the kitchen it would be super hot, right?  Nope, no steam coming up.  I tasted it and it was luke warm!  How is that possible?  How long has this been sitting out?  I also paid for extra chicken and I am not kidding when I say there were only 4 small pieces of shredded chicken at the bottom of the cup.  Normally there is so much chicken added, but today it was non-existent.  I couldn't even be bothered to talk to the manager again.  Also, it was really messy inside.  Most tables had crumbs and hadn't been wiped down.  We ended up moving tables because we were right under the AC vent and both chairs I sat in were covered in crumbs that I had to wipe off.  Such a disappointment since I had my heart on eating here today.

I have two girls, ages 3 and 1.  This place was absolutely perfect for them!  It's huge inside with tons of things for them to touch, climb on, and play with.  I'm looking forward to taking them again during the summer when it's too hot to be outside!

I am a cider drinker and they have a nice selection to choose from.  However, they are sold out of the Wyder's Pear Cider often, which is my favorite!

This is the worst frozen yogurt place I've ever been to!  First, when I first went last summer, they were pretty new.  I thought that was why it was so plain inside.  They also didn't have much to offer.  The frozen yogurt was too tart and then only offered 2 or 3 flavors--none of which I liked.  There was a plain flavor (ick!), mango, and maybe peach or something else strange.  And they put the toppings on themselves.  They barely put anything on there!  Definitely not worth the cost!  Oh!!  And because they were new, their website was pretty plain and boring.  However, I must add that it had soooo many grammatical errors.  So unprofessional!  And I see now that their website has nothing on it.  How can you have a business in 2009 and not have a website?  I've been in since then and it still is just as bad as then.  The yogurt is disgusting and I would never go here again.  It's disappointing because I don't have any other frozen yogurt places near my house!

I've been here three times and each time I tell myself I'm not going to bother coming back...  I've had the Caesar Salad before, BAD.  Today I had the wildflower salad.  It was so blah and small.  Especially for the high prices.  There's always a long wait to order and an even longer wait for the food to come out.  I don't know why I bother coming back.

I was so surprised by this restaurant!    It's located in the strip mall by Safeway and I automatically was judging that it would be bad.  I was wrong!  First, someone greeted and opened the front door for us.  It wasn't too crowded, but it was Sunday night.  Their Sunday night dinners are PHENOMENAL!  Great food and a decent price!  I had the most delicious tomatoes, that were locally grown, and I don't even like tomatoes!  The entire experience was awesome.  Great, upscale restaurant, delicious food!  I would definitely come here again!

I'm not a huge drinker, but I like this place.  It's huge inside!  I like cider, but can't ever find it at the grocery store.  Here they have tons of different kinds of cider.  And the people who work here have always been super nice and talk to me about my beer while checking out.

I loved this place!!  First, my drink was delicious!  I ordered the bellini and it was definitely one of the best that I've ever had--kind of fizzy, but so good!  The bread and butter was hot and delicious!  I didn't LOVE the Field Salad, but it was okay.  But I did LOVE my steak and french fries!  When asked how I wanted my steak prepared, I said Medium.  The waiter suggested Medium Rare since it's a thin hanger steak.  I'm so glad he suggested that.  It was perfectly cooked for me!  And I would love to try the dessert one day!  Looks delicious as well!

Delicous!!  I wish there were one closer to my house in North Phoenix!  There's always a lot of different options to choose from for yogurt and for the toppings.    And it always looks super busy, but I've never really had to wait in any type of line.  I'm always in and out.

I've seen this place for years just driving past the corner of Frank Lloyd Wright and Scottsdale Road.  Lucky for me, I was at a Superbowl Party where someone brought 2 of these cakes!  There was red velvet and chocolate.  Silly me only tried the Red Velvet at the party.  I thought it was really great and moist.  However, since then I've had the Red Velvet mini bundt cake, and I don't really love it.  I must say that Sprinkles' Red Velvet is so much better.  Maybe the larger cakes are better, maybe it needed to sit out longer.  I don't know.  I just know I won't be ordering the Red Velvet from here anymore.  I do Love the chocolate cake with the chocolate chips in it!  So so good!  Makes me wish I would have tried to large bundt cake at that Superbowl party now!  I also had a sample of the Lemon at the store, and I think I'll try that next time as well.  Keep in mind, it does have some type of nut.  I know my daughter wasn't a fan because of the nuts, but I loved it!

I love this place!  It's always busy, but I've never had to wait long.  They have tons of different flavors and different toppings!  I love that it is self-serve because I can add the exact amount of toppings that I want!  So yummy!

I am a huge fan of their hummus!  The best anywhere!  However, I always have to ask for extra pitas...  I always get the greek salad with chicken.  It's delicious!  And when they add the extra chicken, it's almost too much!  I guess I would rather there be too much chicken than not enough.  Service here has always been good.  I like the inside of this Pita Jungle a lot more than the other locations.  This one is much nicer inside with a nice bar area too.

I checked in here on Yelp and saw there was a coupon for a free drink or free appetizer when you use the Yelp coupon.  Unfortunately, our waitress said no, they are not accepting those anymore.  Maybe Blue Martini should make sure that the ad comes down before you stop accepting them.  Not good for business!

First, it was a cute little restaurant and our waiter was very helpful with suggestions.  I love that they use fresh ingredients from Arizona.  However, I did not like the food.  We started with the cheese platter.  It wasn't great.  One of the cheeses was creamy, but the other 2 or 3 I didn't like.  I especially didn't like the Parmesan--it was so dry and did not have a good taste to it.  For dinner I ordered the Tagliatta.  It was okay, but again-not great.  I liked my dates fresh sausage a bit more.  But again, not enough to ever want to come back.  Also, I absolutely hated my drink.  The waiter recommended the Camparita.  It looked good, but it tasted so bad.  My date thought it had too much grapefruit juice and was very bitter.  I thought it tasted more like tequila.  Either way, it was so bad that it sat full on my table the entire time.  Which brings me to say--I wish more waiters would notice that you aren't drinking your drink.  I always feel bad sending something back, especially since he recommended it.  I do appreciate when I'm somewhere and the waiter goes out of their way to try to find me something else I might like.  It's just the little things like that which I appreciate.

Yum!    I am a huge fan of their brushetta.  I don't think I've eaten anything else but it!  This was my first time at the Central location.  I came on a Friday afternoon around 2.  Parking was an absolute nightmare and I had to park across the street at the Circle K and pray that my car wasn't broken into.  We also didn't have a great seating arrangement.  It would have been nicer if they would have noticed all sitting in the middle of the patio and taking up half the walkway and let us sit at a table when one opened, but they never did.  Also, when I went to the bar and asked if they served any other alcohol besides wine and beer, the bartender told me no.  Later, I saw someone with another type of drink.  When I asked, they told me it was a mimosa and that they also served Belinis.  Not sure why the bartender didn't tell me that when I had tried to order a drink instead of serving me water.  Seems silly....but whatever.  I ordered the brushetta platter.  It was delicious!  I believe I ordered the goat cheese and bell pepper (it was my least favorite of all, but still good), the mozarella & tomato (yum), apple & fig (delicious), and prosciutto (spelling???)--it was my favorite!!!  I would definitely come back, only because of the delicious food!!

I have been going here for over two years.  I moved 30 minutes north, and I still make the trip to go to him because he is the best!  He is certified in pediatric and pregnancy.  I started coming here when I was pregnant with my second daughter.  I know he is also a certified sports chiropractor.  Kathy, in the front office, is one of my most favorite people ever!  She always has a friendly smile and is so helpful!  I also love Heidi, the massage therapist, who is there on Fridays!  I have recommended him to friends.  He is the best!   Update:  I left here when the main doctor left years ago.  Dr. Patrick Chivaroli was amazing!  I don't know where he went, but I definitely recommend him!   When he left, there was a girl chiropractor, and she was fine, but I didn't like her enough to keep making the 30 minute drive.  I now have a new chiro right near me in Tramonto who I love!

My 3-year old took some beginning dance classes here.  She absolutely loved it, and the owner Melissa!!  The class was great because they did about 20 minutes of ballet, 20 minutes of tap, and then 20 minutes of gymnastics.

When I first heard about this place months ago, I never thought I would be interested.  I don't like southern or fried foods.  Then I saw a write up in the newspaper where people voted on their chicken versus some fried chicken from some fancy place....and it was pretty much a split decision.  The descriptions of the food made me want to try it.    So we went last night (Friday night) for the first time to the Scottsdale location.  It was busy, but we we still sat immediately.  I was starving and the smell was wonderful!  I ordered the Betty Boop (one waffle and one breast) and Sierra Mist.  They do not serve alcohol here.  It comes in a huge mason jar.  I tasted the Kool Aid which was yummy too!  We also ordered the macaroni and cheese.  The chicken and waffles came out first.  The mac and cheese didn't come out until we were almost halfway done with our meal, which was a little strange.  The fried chicken was absolutely amazing!!  It was perfectly cooked.  The chicken was so tasty.  The fried part isn't overwhelming and greasy.  I am definitely a fan of fried chicken now!   The waffle was good, nothing special, but the sweetness did complement the saltiness of the fried chicken.  I wouldn't order the mac and cheese again.  It was a small portion in case you are thinking of sharing.  But it was too cheesy for my liking.  I liked that the manager came around and asked how our meal was.  She seemed to genuinely care what we thought of it.  I liked the food so much that I went again the next day with my two daughters!  The place is kid-friendly, although there is not a kid menu.  I ordered both of them full plates, which I probably shouldn't have.  They could have easily shared one.  They loved it as well--and the kool aid!  I would definitely recommend this place!  I never thought it would be somewhere I would like, but I will definitely go back.  Best chicken ever!  And cute t-shirts too...

I had heard that they sold British bacon, so I decided to stop by.  At first I thought they were closed because I didn't see any cars in the parking lot.  Then I saw the entrance was over to the side and there were 2 cars.    The store was nice and empty of customers.  The produce and food was displayed very nicely.  The store was clean and welcoming.    And yes, they have English bacon!  Yum yum!  And it's much cheaper than going to the British shop over on Hayden and McDowell!  Self checkout was a breeze.  I would definitely come here again.

I came here about a year ago for new tires and was given a card for 5 free oil changes.    The guys are always very friendly and quick.  Luckily, my gym is basically across the street from here, so I dropped off my car and went there yesterday when I needed an oil change.  Also, when one of my windshield wipers came off a few months ago while it was raining out, I pulled in here and one of the gentlemen came out and quickly fixed it for me within a minute and I was back on the road for free.    I highly recommend it here!

Always feel comfortable here, never feel like I'm getting ripped off. Everyone is very courteous.  Everything usually takes a few hours, so plan on someone dropping your car off with you. But they are busy because they are good and lots of people come here!

I don't like this place, but since it's the only place in the neighborhood to go for a bagel, I end up here too often.  The cinnamon-raisin bagel might have a total of 3 raisins in the entire bagel.  This has happened to me sooo many times, that I have stopped ordering it.  I feel like I'm just eating a cinnamon bagel.   You have to ask them to double toast your bagel.  If not, you will find that you have a luke-warm bagel with butter on it.  Ick.  I like my bagel browned just a little bit.  But I'm sure I will continue to come here until something better opens up nearby.

What a fantastic happy hour!!  Happy hour ends at 6pm and gets you half priced drinks and appetizers.  I love that they have Wyder's Pear Cider, which is my favorite!  I also had the pretzels, which are pretty okay.    Our server was fantastic and quick.  He even got us in another round right before happy hour ended so that we didn't have to pay full price.  I can't wait to go again!

I've been here 3 times for a group happy hour.   The first time, it was excellent.  Had a great waiter who stayed on top of things and even came over to remind us about happy hour ending and to see if we wanted any more drink orders so he could get them in before the cut off.  The second time, it was a bit worse.  We had a large group, and took up the entire patio.  However, there was only 1 waitress for about 40 of us.  She forgot orders, brought out wrong things, and had no idea who ordered which thing.  She overcharged me too many drinks that had already been paid for.  But since they have decent food, and GREAT prices during happy hour, we decided to come a third time. Apparently the manager didn't appreciate our business because he immediately asked when we would be leaving.  He said that we take up the entire patio and no one else can sit out there because we take all the seats.  Mind you, every single person there is a customer.  Every single one of us ordered multiple drinks and plenty of food.  It's not like anyone was just sitting taking a seat, but not paying for anything. This manager was so rude, that my co-workers debated leaving right then.  We will definitely not come back again.  We also do a fund raiser with them and our school once or twice a year.  We are planning on canceling that.  They have lost our business now, which is unfortunate.   If you have a large group, go elsewhere.  If you are looking for cheap drinks, and there's only a few of you, this is an okay place.  The pretzels are cheap and okay, nothing special.  My major compliment is that they have Wyder's Pear Cider, which is my favorite!

This has to be my favorite donut place (maybe just after Rainbow Donuts off Greenway and Cave Creek Rd).  There's a huge selection, they always taste fresh.  Only negative is that sometimes it's hard to understand the workers because some aren't native English speakers.  So I've gotten a wrong order before.

Dunkin Donuts coffee is my favorite!  I come here about 3-4 times a week.  The coffee is almost always perfect!  The workers in the drive-thru are always friendly and quick.  I absolutely hate going in though.  For some reason it always smells like something is burning inside.  No one wants to smell burnt food, especially first thing in the morning!  Yuck.  But it smells like that every single time, so it must be something they can't get rid of.  So I try to go through the drive thru as much as possible!

I joined this gym after leaving Lifetime Fitness because it was too expensive.  But I've realized that Mountainside is just as expensive as Lifetime, just closer to my hose and without a pool.  I think the monthly fee for just me is $40 and then I also pay $25 a month for unlimited childcare.  But I must say that I've liked the gym.  It has everything I need.  It's rarely too busy, which I like.  The child care center is nice and I like that you can watch the kids on the TV's that are all around the gym and on every single cardio machine.  I love that each machine has its own tv!  It makes doing cardio so much easier when I can watch and listen to whatever I choose.  I don't like that you have to bring a lock.  It is just annoying when I forget it.  I also don't like that bathroom area.  There are no towels in there.

Wendy and Paul Hartman have a wonderful gymnastics and tumbling studio here.  Both of my daughters, ages 3 and 5, love to come here!  They are so friendly, as are the instructors that both my daughters have had.  They are also patient and they interact really well with the kids.  The gym is clean and organized, with seats for parents to watch through big windows.  It's also a nice place to hold a kid's birthday party!  I would highly recommend this place to others!

My favorite part of this place is the massage chairs and the foot massages they give!  I've been here twice.  The first time wasn't great, but I liked my toenails.  I got there early and they put me in a chair to soak my feet with water that was freezing cold.  The second time was better, but I didn't love my nail designs.  It came out looking like a "Bollywood" design.  I guess next time I should be more specific about what type of design I want instead of just saying I want nail art.    They have a lot of colors, but they seem to have a lot of the dark reds and not as much in the light pink department.  I thought about bringing in my own color.  I like that they give you a list of options to choose from so that you know exactly what everything is and what it costs.

I first visited Zinburger during Restaurant Week.  I absolutely LOVED it!  The food was delicious and the service was excellent!  I just went again this past week and I didn't love it as much.  The burger was good and the fries were okay, but it wasn't as great as during Restaurant Week.  The service was just okay as well.  My daughters order chicken fingers and a grilled cheese.  Both were bad.  I had the Zinburger, which I really like.  I also order just the normal fries, which were just okay.  I won't be rushing to come back any time soon.

I've been coming here since high school in Illinois, so when I moved to Arizona I just figured it was easiest to continue coming here.  I've always had a fine experience here.  Normally the wait isn't too long and they don't usually try to make me buy anything I don't want.  I always get the 3-year contract.  However, make sure you make a note of when your contract is up because when you want more contacts they will make you come in again for another exam and all of that.  So I just order a ton right before that agreement is up so that it can actually push me another year before I have to sign up again.

I used to go to the Blu Agave in old town Scottsdale, so I was really looking forward to ordering food from here to go last night!  First, I googled Blu Agave and couldn't find their website.  It kept bringing up the Mayo Blvd restaurant, which I later found out has an entirely different menu.  It's too bad because I really wanted to order the Kettle Carne!  I finally found their actual website through Yelp.  I was a little bummed to see it wasn't the same menu, but I decided to order the Carne Asada Burro.  I grabbed the phone number, jumped in my car, and called from the car.  After being sent to a voicemail twice, finally someone picked up.  When I asked to order to go, they put me on hold for a very long time.  Finally, when someone came on to take my order I asked for the Carne Asada burro.  He informed me that they have a limited summer menu and it isn't on the menu.  I told him that since I'm in the car and don't have access to the menu, what would he recommend.  He suggested the carne asada tacos.  I told him I'd like rice and beans too and he said it came with it.  Great.  When I come into the restaurant (on a Saturday night at 8pm), it is completely dead.  There was not 1 person sitting at a table!  There was no hostess or anyone around.  I had to walk all the way to the back where the bar was.  There were about 10 people sitting around the bar with really obnoxiously loud music playing.  The bartender came out with my food and I paid and left.  When I got home and opened my food container, I was really disappointed.  I wish I had taken a picture.  It was pathetic.  There was a little bit of meat on top of a tortilla at the bottom, with some tomatoes and other things.  That's it.  I can't believe I spent $14 on that!  What happened to the rice and beans too?  I didn't care for the tortilla, so I just ate the carne asada with a fork.  It was good, but not $14 good.  I can realistically see spending maybe $4 on this meal.  It was nothing.  What a let down.  I should have just gone to Chipotle, spent $6 and gotten a ton more food for that price.  After reading all these reviews, I would stear clear of this place and go elsewhere....

I have been here a few times now, and it's been usually great!  I love the patio and the fact that the patio is only for age 21 and up.  On a nice night, it's great to sit out there having a drink and eating their delicious pizza!  I also love that they have one of my favorite beers, Ace Pear Cider!  Not many places carry cider, so this is a huge bonus!    There were still seats available at 6:30 in the evening, so it wasn't too full.  The wait staff has always been pleasant and nice.  I do love their pizza!  I'm from Chicago and I feel like I am a bit of a pizza snob, but I love their thin sausage pizza!  They use such fresh ingredients and I love their mozzarella.  So fresh and delicious!  I also like their Mediterranean salad.  I have ordered pizza to go from here twice, and both times I wasn't super impressed with it.  I think once I got it home it was cold and just not as good.  But I know I love it when I'm there!

A big group of us came here on a Friday night for happy hour after work.  It was great!  I loved the openness and we could sit without bumping into other people.  There was an area for kids to run around with a playground for them.  It was perfect outside!  (Although I don't think I'd come here during the summer....it must get awfully hot out there.  There's not really anywhere to sit inside)  You have to go inside to order food and I also ordered all my drinks inside.  The bartender was very nice and helped me decide what to drink since I am picky.  I didn't love the food selection because it was mostly greasy bar food and I was in the mood for something lighter.  It kind of had a Monastery/Greasewood Flats vibe to it.

Josh is an AMAZING trainer and I am so thankful to have found him!  Our dog Brody has had aggression issues towards other dogs.  Brody is 11 years old so I was worried that he would be classified under the "you can't teach an old dog new tricks" thing.  But Josh took him in for 2 weeks and within just a few days, Brody was already interacting with other dogs in a friendly matter!  During the first week, Brody stayed at Josh's and we did not see him.  This was so hard because we missed our dog, but thankful Josh updates his Facebook Good Doggy page every day with new photos of the dogs so we can see what they have been working on each day!  It would be the highlight of my day to see new photos (and my kids loved checking to see if there's any new photos!) During week two, my family would come over and go on walks with Brody and Josh so we could learn how to walk and train him correctly.  It was amazing to see Brody walking correctly--right next to us instead of constantly pulling us along!  I am so glad that we found Good Doggy and we are recommending Josh to everyone!

First to review!  Well, this is the new business in the old Krispy Kreme spot.  I was excited when I saw something new was opening and couldn't wait to try it out with my 2 daughters who both love Asian food.  We decided to stop by for dinner tonight since it just opened either today or yesterday.  Let's start with the Pros: 1. Friendly staff 2. Delicious food!  My daughters both ordered the children's orange chicken with white rice ($5.99 each)  Their dinner was a perfect portion size for them each with lots of chicken and other vegetables.  The chicken was really good, not the overly deep fried stuff you get from the other Asian place over on 27th Drive near Mountainside.  (That place has more fried coating than it does actual chicken).  They both loved their meals.  I ordered Chicken Lo Mei (soft noodles) for $7.99.  It was delicious as well!  I normally order Kung Pao Chicken with rice, but I'm glad I decided to try something new today.  I would definitely order it again.   And now the cons: 1. I know this is dumb, but I have a huge pet peeve about businesses that have grammatical or spelling mistakes.  It just looks unprofessional.  And hand written signs, too.  They had a sign inside that said, "Please wait for seatting."   2. I think it's a bit overpriced/expensive. It's tiny inside and I think I was expecting more of a take-out place.  There are only 8 tables inside so I really wouldn't think of this as a sit down restaurant.  But their prices are comparable to PF Changs (from their website) PF Chang's Lettuce Wraps $7.95 Hong Kong's Lettuce Wraps $7.99  PF Chang's Kids Sweet & Sour Chicken $4.95 Hong Kong's Kids Sweet & Sour Chicken $5.99  Some of their other main dishes are about $2-$3 cheaper than PF Changs.  I would say the majority of Hong Kong's dishes range from $9-$12 each. There is a huge difference in the decor/ambiance of going to dinner at Changs or coming here.  Don't get me wrong, the food is yummy, I just was a little surprised by their prices.   I would definitely come here again.  However, with the prices as high as they are, I wouldn't come here often.

It's probably a good thing that I don't live closer to a Five Guys....  I am in love with their fries!!  They are delicious!  I order the regular size and even it is too big.  Not only do they fill the cup, but then they also fill the brown bag that the cup of fries is poured into!  This is the first place where I saw the cool soda machine that I've now seen in a few other places.  But I love that you can pick your own drinks from so many different flavors!  Although, I get cherry sprite every time!  Yum!!!  Every time I have been here, there's always been good seating and everything has been clean.  My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it's a bit overpriced.

This is my current favorite restaurant!  Every time I come the food is delicious!  I love their pizzas, but just recently tried the barrata.  (Not sure if I'm spelling that correctly, but it's an appetizer of mozzarella that is still a little creamy, sprinkled with sea salt, and you spread it on this delicious bread!  So yummy!!  The service is hit or miss at times, but the food is what keeps me coming back!  I don't love the restaurant decor as much because it just doesn't have that homey feeling that I love getting from places like pizzeria bianco or cibo.  But the food.....yum!

Just got to experience this place for the first time last night and it was delicious!  I tried the PRINCIPE pizza and it was so perfect with prosciutto, arugula, and parm!  All my favorite things!  Service was super fast, cute location, and I thought the complimentary dessert and limoncello were a nice touch.  I'll definitely come here again!
