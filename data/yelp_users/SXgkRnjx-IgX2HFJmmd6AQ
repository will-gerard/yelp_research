I love Einstein but that was by far the WORST EXPERIENCE I have ever had. No one was smiling, no one said hello and I had to ask for someone to help me. It looked like they were all forced to be there and hated their lives. My bagel with cream cheese - with no one in line - took 10 minutes to be made. I asked for my food to go, they had it placed in sit-in plates. I asked for it to be placed to go and the man helping me looked at me and said "oh....I guess It did say to go..." I will not be going back to that location - EVER.

Amazing food!!! I haven't had anything I don't like. All the goodness without the guilt!
