Negative 3 stars!  Ordered sweet and sour pork, tasted like crap, rice and egg were no good.  Everything tastes old.  Hope I don't get sick!

We decided to visit it after a friend told us all about it.   We went after "meet the teacher night" at our school in Mesa, It was so worth the drive!  Will be going back alot more.   Cant wait ill they have hot dogs.

Great Little chocolatier shop. Reason why I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars is they need a bigger place with more chocolate to choose from. The stuff they have is really good but they need more. I'm sure eventually have a bigger place as they get a bigger phone. I bet rent in Las Vegas is super expensive so start out small and grow.  Will deathly come back next time were in Vegas.

Since I work in the area a lot iv eaten at ALL the food spots for lunch. This is A much needed yummy lunch spot.  Love their pepperoni pizza!  Not sure what else to say, but yelp says I need more words.  Interesting...  So yes it's a 5 star lunch spot for me.

We love this place, they do customer request pizzas. Tanner is one awesome manager at this place.    My daughter loves the cinnamon sticks dessert pizza  Love that they have mug root beer.   Emma treated my daughter great.

This place is addicting!  Love getting the Brass Monkey.  It's Mt Dew  peach and orange syrup with heavy whipping cream!    I love that they open at 7:30 on weekdays  Open 9am on Saturdays and closed on Sunday's.   So glad this place is here in Mesa.  Oh they even have a food truck now, so keep your eyes open!
