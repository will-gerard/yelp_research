Terrible. Some of the worst service and worst pizza I've ever had.

Quick friendly service. Very accomodating w special requests (vegan). Great egg rolls that are actually home made and hand rolled not the usual frozen sysco fare most places serve.  The food was all delicious and service was impeccable.  Very prompt and extremely polite servers.  Food was prepared quickly but at a comfortable pace, we did not feel rushed.

Horrible. Rude service, little to no options for vegetarians, overpriced for portion size. Rock hard flavorless tomatoes, etc. My egg salad had shells in it. When I complained they looked at me like there was nothing wrong, no offer of a refund/replacement, just a shrug and "oh". Would not return, I always give restaurants a 2nd chance because mistakes do happen, but their complete lack of caring has resulted in a lost customer for life, they do not deserve a chance to redeem themselves.

love the vegan options. try it, the daiya cheese they use is just as good if not better than the real thing. service can be a little slow, but always polite and welcoming.

They have a surprising amount of vegetarian options, just stick w green sauce as the red sauces are beef based. Love their salsa, it all seems to be cooked rather than fresh but I still enjoy it, and just the right amount of heat.

it's okay, like the vegan aspect. using tofu in place of paneer is not a good substitute, i'd rather go without than have the tofu in there, it's just not the right texture.  Spice level was ok, could have had more flavor, heat level was fine.  The "veggie based" rather than cream sauces they tout are a great idea, but sit/walk by the kitchen and look around, you'll see big jars of veggie stock base. You know what that stuff is? Salt, more salt, msg, yeast extract, and some veg flavor.  C'mon, if you're trying to do healthy then why base all your sauces on fake flavored salt paste and pass it off as a healither option.  Honestly, i'd rather have the full fat, cream laden version that tastes so much better, at least it was natural.

At 1pm on a Wednesday we were the only customers.  Service was friendly, but slow. The 2 servers/manager were too busy chatting on the phone in the back or eating their own lunch.  Another group departing as we came in seemed to be waiting at the front counter for about 10 minutes for the girl in the office to finish her phone call and close their tab.    Food was good, reasonably priced for a lunch combo with more than enough food.  3 of us ordered the lunch special (2 vegetarian, 1 chicken) which were all good, although the heat level was off.  The 2 vegetarians asked for heat level 3 (offered range of 1-10) while the chicken was requested as a 9.  Both came out around a 5. Why bother asking if you're not going to follow through.  Portions were good but oddly served.  Lunch combo includes salad, chutneys, rice, naan, entree, side, and desert.   For our group of 3 we were served 2 bowls of rice and 2 pieces of naan. We didn't run out, so it was ok, but seemed odd when everything else was served in individual dishes.  We had to ask for the salad and chutneys which were forgotten.  Masala Chai tea (which to me is the barometer of quality for any restaurant) was just ok. Too much fennel/anise flavor, and too thick/heavy being made with a lot of whole milk.    I checked in on yelp (which is how I found the place, after my first choice and favorite Udupi turned out to be closed/out of business!).  Yelp specified it was open for lunch, and offered a $15 for $25 coupon, which I purchased.  It wasn't until the end of the meal and attempting to pay that I was rudely told the promo wasn't valid with the lunch special.  I told her that wasn't mentioned in the terms, she made some excuse and wandered off.   I decided I'd just take it up with Yelp later, and put my card in the folio.  Unfortunately she disappeared and after about 10 minutes of waiting I tracked her down in the office behind the hostess stand, knocking on the door and interrupting her personal phone call.  At that point I was getting upset. with the service and called her out on the yelp promo, insisting that the only restrictions are that it's not valid for takeout or on Fridays/Saturdays. She disagreed but finally said she'd honor it and wrote down the promo code and adjusted my bill.  Overall the food was good but service was unacceptable. Portions and prices if ordering the lunch combo were reasonable but ala-carte and dinner menu pricing were excessive and the portions are probably the same judging by other reviews.  I would not return given the variety of other Indian options in the area.

Terrible food and service.  Consistently slow. Have to wait ages past quoted times even for pickup. Food is frequently cold or incorrect.  Save yourself the trouble and drive a few miles to the 7th ave and union hills location.

Bungalow is fun, unique, always changing. This isn't your typical warehouse store packed with cookie-cutter designs. High end case goods, quality artwork, fun and unique accessories, books, awesome candles, even vintage fashion and jewelry. The designers do free in home consults for you, actually know what their doing, and don't pressure you like the used car salesman approach you'll find at other stores. The store is also pet friendly.
