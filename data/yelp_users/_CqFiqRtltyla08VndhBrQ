Super friendly staff and incredibly helpful. Every tank is labeled and you cannot miss the price or type of fish. Got everything I needed for my new buddy Nuke LaLoosh just on my lunchbreak.

Set near a hip intersection of town, yet very obvious this establishment was there long before. Kind of a bust, and not too friendly when the place is busy - though maybe it's better on a slower night. Also, hope you like a lot of screaming.

If you've ever been to New Orleans and have therefore been spoiled by actual cajun food, this place is a guaranteed disappointment. My $12 shrimp po'boy had maybe 10 shrimp on it, something that is supposed to be a staple of cajun cuisine. The couple of small pickles, half of a tomato slice and soggy lettuce given as dressings for the sandwich were an embarrassment. I'm not sure what flavor the chips were, because there was no flavor. I think I could have had better at Long John Silver's, and I hate Long John Silver's.

Best chips and salsa in the wide world and delicious hand-tossed margaritas. The staff is incredibly friendly, and the atmosphere is impressive. Do yourself a favor and order the Creamy Chipotle Chicken. You're welcome.

If you know of a place where drinks are strong, these drinks are stronger. Good people, and an even better jukebox. I've had some great times with my lady Palo.

This is one of my favorite restaurants. The chips and salsa are great and so are the margaritas. The staff is unmatched. If your bowl of chips look even half empty, you can bet there will be a spinning bowl of fresh chips on the table before you even know it. I always order the Baja Spinach & Feta Cheese Chimi, and so should you. They also (somehow) know when you're celebrating. So when you're handed two pink shots you didn't order called Mexican Koo-laid, don't be scarred. Just suck it down and order another margarita.

Super cute restaurant with great service. Fun, local atmosphere and family-like staff after just a few visits. Feeney's Steak Salad for life!

Really cute atmosphere and friendly staff, and opens up during spring and fall as a great seating area. Coffee and groceries a little over-priced, but the seating area makes up for it. The green tea smoothie is amazing.

THE best pho ever. I can't stop eating here. The staff does their job well and the prices are incredible. If you're heading there for lunch, however, try to go before or after about noon to 1:00 p.m. It can be crowded, but it serves as the best indication for their amazing food.

Great little place. Very good burgers and people. Very clean and cute, and a perfect patio for spring or fall.

Definitely a weird experience. Sun's in your face if you get there at the wrong time of day, no parking lot so good luck on the street, and weird bathroom thing going on. Really good space for groups, though, and definitely a good array of drink choices. Not great for an intimate evening.
