The Courtyard Phoenix Airport is a really nice hotel. It has modern furnishings and decorations throughout. The hotel itself is very clean. The staff was friendly and helpful.  We stayed here after missing a connecting flight and had a very pleasant stay.

We traveled through the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport this week for work and found the experience A-OK. Phoenix is a clean, modern airport with lots of shops and restaurants and easily navigated. There was no line at security and we had our shoes off and on in no time. No complaints or problems whatsoever.

I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Phoenix for one night a few weeks ago for a convention. The location was very convenient since it was only a short taxi ride from the airport and right across the street form the convention center. The staff was friendly and the hotel was nice throughout. My room was clean, comfortable and quiet. I don't expect much more than that really. I didn't use any amenities other than the swimming pool and hot tub. That was one area of the hotel that could have been better. The pool area was very dated looking and showed signs of negligence and bad upkeep. This surprised me because the rest of the hotel was much nicer. Overall a fine experience with some room for improvements.

If you're in Las Vegas, do yourself a favor and venture away from The Strip and discover what old Las Vegas was like. Located inside the restored La Concha motel, the Neon Museum is home to a lot of Vegas history.   For $18 per person you can take a guided tour through the "Neon Boneyard" which is home to neon signs from famous Vegas hotels, restaurants, and other places. The tour is expensive but it's a great way to learn more about the history of Vegas and to see some great signs! It was well worth the expensive in my opinion and I would even go back again. Free parking is provided just outside the museum.   In a word the Neon Museum in Las Vegas is awesome and well worth visiting!

The Rio is an older Las Vegas casino/hotel, and it shows it's age. Although our room itself, one of the newer Samba Suites was nice, the rest of the Rio was old, dirty, dimly lit, poorly maintained in areas, and smelled like stale cigarettes throughout.   Our room featured a large living space and bedroom with a floor-to-ceiling view of the strip, which was really cool. The windows were tinted so we could leave the curtains open and enjoy the view during the daytime and nighttime. We also had a large bathroom area with tons of counter space and a shower/tub combo. The TV had a large HDTV, but the TV signal wasn't in HD... The mini-fridge was nice to have, but made a noisy, humming sound. Finally, because we were on the 34th floor, we heard some noise from the nightclub upstairs, but nothing that bad or upsetting.   Overall I was happy with our room at the Rio, it was sufficient for our needs minus a few things, but the rest of the hotel was lacking. On our next trip to Las Vegas I won't be staying at the Rio. I expected more given the price, even though we did get a good deal.

Chili's Too is nothing special. They have many of the same items you'd find at a regular Chili's restaurant but caters to faster items to get people fed and on their way. We ate here earlier in the week and the service and the food were in need of improvement. I would not recommend this place.

I flew into Phoenix for a business trip this week, picked-up my rental car and headed off to the Radisson Fort McDowell Resort in Fort McDowell, Arizona. Past Tempe and Mesa I drove and into the mountains, the whole time thinking that I must be headed into the boonies or something. After about 40 miles I arrived at the Radisson Fort McDowell Resort and was pleasantly surprised. Situated on an Indian Reservation you wouldn't expect much from this place but you'd be wrong. The resort is great! Very nice inside and out, modern architecture, comfortable rooms and fine dining. This is a real desert oasis!  Although the architecture of the resort and hotel is modern it features a southwest flair and southwest inspired motifs throughout. They also used a lot of natural stone for many of the floors and walls which looks great and helps give it a rustic look. Our room was spacious with two queen sized beds, a 40" LCD television, a small desk, easy chair, and the other usual amenities like a wall safe, closet, ironing board, etc. The furnishings were again modern like the rest of the hotel, but with some southwest flair. Unfortunately the TV signal was not HD and the wireless Internet was pretty slow but serviceable. The beds were super comfortable, very plush, and we both slept wonderfully.  Outside the resort features one of the nicest, if not THE nicest pool and pool patio deck I've ever seen. Check out the photos I posted, it is one cool looking pool. With natural stone and water features the pool is large and very nice. We went for a swim one evening and enjoyed the heated pool and especially enjoyed the hot tub. They have two hot tubs and like I said the pool is very large, so I expect it doesn't ever get too crowded.  The next day we attended a sales training at the on-site conference center. The conference accommodations were very nice, good lighting, and clean and well maintained. The food that was provided for breakfast, lunch and snacks was good. For part of the day there was another conference in an adjacent room and they were noisy from time to time, sometimes interrupting our conference a little, but otherwise the conference space was great. The walls could be a little more soundproof I think but overall it was fine.  I'm not a gambler or slot junkie so I spend much time in the casino other than a quick look about. The casino didn't look like much although it was plenty busy and people seemed happy enough. The Fort McDowell Casino is certainly no Las Vegas but I expect for the citizens of Phoenix, Mesa and Tempe it might be nice enough for a weekend away. However, smoky, gross smelling casinos aren't my thing personally.  All in all I couldn't say anything nicer about the Radisson Fort McDowell Resort as a hotel. It was a first rate hotel and a great place to stay. Sure it's a drive from Phoenix but it was worth it. If you're in the mood for gambling you'd probably be better served elsewhere but the casino might be worth a try... If you're attending a conference or are looking for a place to hold a conference this is a first class place.

Mr. Mama's isn't much to look at but the service was friendly and my breakfast burrito was pretty good. Prices were cheap too. Give it a try.

My review isn't fair because I didn't actually eat here... instead I walked in, walked around to see what they had to offer and left. The selection of food was very small and didn't look much better than school lunch food served at the cafeteria. Even though it was only $10 per person the buffet just didn't seem worth it. I decided to go eat somewhere else.

Naked City Pizza is a smoky dive bar that happens to serve up some pretty tasty pizzas! We enjoyed a very good pizza with pepperoni, sausage, roasted pepper, onion, olives, mozzarella and red sauce. The pizza was fired in a brick oven and the crust was great. The pizza logs were also very good. Service was excellent. Prompt and friendly. Naked City seems like a good place to get some eats, have a drink, and hang-out.

We stopped at the Tilted Kilt Pub & Eatery for something to eat just after 10pm on a weeknight only to find out that the kitchen was closed. So we had a few drinks instead. Drinks were nothing special. The "talent" was also not that great. Disappointing experience overall. Too bad. It's also never great to walk away hungry. Meh.

The Mob Museum is a very well put together museum about the history of organized crime. It has lots of interactive displays and videos, many mob related artifacts, and loads of cool memorabilia. There is almost TOO much to take in and there is so much to read and to watch that it's a little overwhelming almost. Plan on spending some time at The Mob Museum because it will easily take your two, three or more hours to see it all. But regardless of how much time you spend, go see the museum because it's very worthwhile.

Farmer Boys serves up some good tasting burgers and fries at this Las Vegas location. The food was freshly prepared and the restaurant itself was clean and well-maintained inside. Service was friendly and efficient. It's nice to see a chain restaurant that actually cares about their customers.

My stomach was hungry and my hopes were high when we stopped at eat. for breakfast on a Saturday morning. We waited 15 minutes for a table, which wasn't bad, but after that we waited even longer before someone finally took our order... After waiting even more time we finally received our food and thankfully it was worth the wait. The Huevos motelenos was vey good and had an excellent flavor and the pancakes were fluffy and delicious with rich, maple syrup. If the service had been better eat. would be a solid five stars.

The Enterprise Rent-A-Car is located a short distance from the airport along with all of the other rental car companies. There is a shuttle to and from the airport that is free, fast and super convenient. I don't know about Kevin's experience but my experience was great. Multiple shuttles were waiting for us when we got off the airplane and multiple shuttles were waiting to take us back to the airport when we returned our car. The rental building is also close by, not far away as Kevin indicated. It is maybe a 15-20 minute ride, if that, to and from the airport and rental building. The employees at Enterprise were friendly and got me into a great car and on my way fast. They upgraded me into a new Dodge Charger for no additional cost and it was a great car to drive. I would highly recommend Enterprise and encourage you to give them a try.
