I have gone here a couple of times for a pregame to events at US Airways Center.  This time was no exception.   I would describe the place as a upscale sports bar.  The service was great, I always had something to drink and the food has always been tasty.  I had the Buffalo chicken wrap with French fries. I would definitely order this again! It was absolutely delicious!!  I also had a spicy bloody mary which was standard, as well as some mimosas.  The mimosas were delicious and came with a mini bottle of champagne in its own little "ice bucket".  Which was just one part of an ice shaker with the mini bottle nestled inside, but it was genius :)  The happy hour looked nice but was not valid during event nights, which was disappointing.  I will definitely visit again :)

Pretty clean facility. Fast and prompt service. Very friendly staff. I just got married and needed to change my last name on my social security card. I was in and out of the office in less than 5 minutes, granted it was a Wednesday at 11:30am. I was dreading coming here and was so relived as to how fast it went. Definitely come to this office.

I have gone to the store once 2 years ago to get a bridesmaids dress and had a good experience.  So when it was finally my turn to try on bridal gowns I decided to go back here.  I have even researched on their website the dresses I wanted to try on.  Unfortunately during my trip they did not have any of them in stock because they are part of a trunk show, which I can understand.  SInce then I have made 3 different appointments with the shop during Demetrios trunk shows with no luck of the dresses being part of it.  At this point I am really disappointed in their service and their lack of wanting to help me.  I was told by the receptionist when I made my last appointment (2 weeks ago) that she would make sure that the dresses I wanted to try on were going to be part of the trunk show.  I had my appointment for today and have been gleaming just to be able to try on the dresses!  Unfortunately when I called this morning to confirm they where there the woman who answered the phone informed me that they were not.  So I've had to cancel my appointment yet again.  I just want to try on the dresses from the Ilissa collection #526 and #518, I didn't think it was going to be this hard to try on dresses I fell in love with over 6 months ago.  If I ever get to try on these dresses I will probably change my rating, I feel like I have been strung along and lied to ... I was willing to spend 5k on a dress and unless they can pull through on their next Demetrios trunk show I will have no other choice but to take my business else where.  Please step it up Demetrios and stop lying that you will make sure you will have certain dresses that you haven't been able to get in 6 months!!!

Just joined this gym a week ago...not impressed at all. The one in Scottsdale seemed to be ran a lot better when I was going to that one. I've come here every day, the spray bottles to wipe the machines and weights have been missing twice, this is unacceptable. I don't pay a fee to come use a machine covered in someone else's sweat. I can understand if a bottle needs to be refilled but to have NO way to clean the machines is unprofessional. I know I would never recommend this gym to anyone else.  I cannot wait until I move...I hope the Walnut Creek location is better than this Tempe one!! They got a star for being open and another for air conditioning. Not much else here.

I love Target!  I go here for almost everything!! They recently just updated their grocery section to include fresh produce, I would have given 5 stars if they would have just made it a Super Target!!  I frequent this Target often and I never leave the store empty handed!    I love how they have recycling bins right in front of the registers!  It is so convenient to be able to bring in old plastic bags and empty plastic bottles to be recycled especially because where I am living does not offer such recycling.    Every employee has always been very friendly.  When I have had to return items there have never been any issues or hassle.  If you live in the north Scottsdale area I would definitely recommend shopping here over Wal-Mart any day!!!!

I love Chick-Fil-A and was so happy to find one so close to where I live in north Scottsdale!!!  I go to this Chick-Fil-A often and have never been disappointed!  I always get an 8 count and a large fry, sometimes a chocolate shake if I'm not counting calories that day :)  Their nuggets are delicious and they offer every kind of dipping sauce you could think of.  They serve waffle fries, which if you ask me there are no better fast food fries out there!!!  And their shakes are amazing! So rich and creamy just wish they were guilt free!!  I like keeping my hands cleans and appreciate the abundance of sanitizers throughout the shop!  The staff is always so friendly and courteous and are willing to go the extra mile to make their customers happy.  If you are in the north Scottsdale area and looking for quality quick chicken definitely check this place out, you will not be disappointed!!!

Just went here to celebrate my mom's birthday with our whole family of 15 people.  The service was great, always had a full drink and basket of chips.  The chicken tacos are about as good as they get!  Absolutely delicious!  The salsa bar is amazing as well.  Didn't drink on this occasion but definitely looks like a great place for happy hour .. $2.50 domestic drafts, $3.00 margaritas.  The server even brought my mom a margarita with a candle lit in the middle of it! Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a great taco and happy hour!!!

This is a great Whole Foods! It's huge! There's so much selection on everything!! I lovetheir cafe area where you can get made to order sandwiches, burritos, and pizza! They even have a salad bar and a hit bar all with delicious options! I definitely try to hooon the day they take off $2 per lb on their salad and hot bars. This is one of the best Whole Foods I've visited!!

This is my go-to grocery store in my neighborhood.  The location, convenience, selection, price and friendly employees are the reason why I continue to choose Bashas' over the competitors.

This is the best self-serve fro-yo place I've visited.  The moment you walk in, you are welcomed to the shop as if they can help you with anything and to let them know if you have questions or would like a sample.  Everything is always very clean and kept clean as you go through and make expected messes.  I love the pomegranate-berry and chocolate frosty.  There are so many toppings to choose from, sometimes it can be hard to tone it down.  The fruit is delicious, every nut you could think of, every chocolate bar, some cereal, frosting ... you name it, they probably have it as a topping.  I would suggest anyone to go here who's looking for a quality frozen yogurt experience!!

Twisted Lizard is great if you're looking for dinner, drinks, a great happy hour, friendly people and a great vibe.  I have never been disappointed with anything from this place.    They have daily wine specials, a great happy hour and an awesome bar and patio.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice place to grab a drink or meal in north Scottsdale!!

I had been living in Arizona for 6 years without a hair stylist that I could proudly call my own, until I found Brook! She does an amazing job at coloring, I could not imagine going to anyone else. I drive 45 minutes each way just so Brook can do my hair! I would suggest her to anyone and everyone!!!

Came here for the first time today. I ordered the Veggie Dun Dun Box. It was so delicious!  Perfect amount of spice, not too overpowering. I would suggest to anyone to at least try it! It was made to order and came out in about 5 minutes during the lunch rush!  I will definitely be coming back!!!
