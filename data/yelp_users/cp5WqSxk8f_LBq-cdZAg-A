Contacted Acorn as I thought I was dealing with a good company. Just got my 2nd refill....wasn't sure if my gauge was working or not so I asked them to stop by and top it off. Guess what, the gauge was working and all they put in was 8.5 gallons of propane and I have a bill sitting here for $195.00. That is a $175.00 trip charge. When I called the person who answered insists beyond any additional conversation despite the fact that my husband was sitting right here and heard every word of my initial call with her and she says she told me ahead of time about the "trip charge". Well she didn't and any time someone has to go to the trouble of right fighting, it is a waste of breath to argue. Take the time to find another company. Even if she were right and she's not, who the heck is going to pay $175 for a trip charge? Seriously?

I saw the message that Wade posted on this review and wasn't surprised. Someone had called my house to "discuss" and I felt that the opportunities to discuss had long since passed. So make your own judgements about any company you hire to do business with and always do your homework when it comes to services that get reviews. Yes it is not uncommon for disgruntled people to write a bad review but also it is because you feel frustrated and have no other way to express yourself. CASE in point. I called Acorn and explained that my gauge read 70% and that I was not sure if it was stuck at 70% or that I was actually not using much propane. After all, propane is not my business. I just wanted to make sure that I would not run out of gas while cooking dinner. So when I expressed this to the "young lady" who answers their phones, YOU CAN BELIEVE that IF she or anyone else had said to me....THAT WILL BE $175.000 for us to come out just to check to see, I would NEVER have agreed to that. Nor would any ONE of you agree to it as it is absurd. Not only is it absurd but the very idea that they are going to have a $175.000 service charge each and every time they deliver propane gas to me, I would have never made those kind of business decisions. Any further more, when you have a person answer your phone whether it is a "hired" person or a relative or whomever....they are the voice of your company and will ultimately make and break relationships. So when I confronted "her" and told her that I would never have agreed to them coming out to "top off" my tank she accused me of being a liar and insisted that she did tell me this emphatically. OK....so you wanted to back peddle and pretend you did? I get that but don't take common sense out of the picture as I have stated above and pretend that we all ALL idiots and would agree to a $175.000 trip charge. Secondly, owners of Acorn Propane.....you should tell your phone people that everyone makes mistakes and they should probably acknowledge some sort of miscommunication ocurred and try to resolve vs. "I will just cover my butt and call her a liar and say that I did tell her about the $175.00". Bottom line is this. If every propany service company in AZ charges $175.00 trip charge, shame on you. I would go to Circle K before I would agree to that. And for anyone else who wants proof of discrepancy....I have a very small 60 gallon tank here that Acorn keeps trying to say is 120 gallons. The driver even wrote on my receipt that it was only 60 gallons. They added  8 gallons of propane for the $194.52 that they evetually refunded me but only after I called them back and asked them about the refund. Candice Hudson

I am a real estate broker who used HomeSpec by accident about 12 years ago and have never used anyone since. Not only are the inspectors excellent but the office staff cannot be equaled.  HomeSpec is an excellent company and I would recommend them to anyone who needs a thorough inspection for any reason.

Just had the worst gel manicure ever and the experience was awful. I had to sit and watch as one techinician practically assaulted a customer only to be yelled at and basically pushed out the door by the owner for complaining. All the while the owner was yelling in Vietnamese. My own gel nails are so horrible that I am tempted to have them done over tomorrow somewhere else. Some of the technicians are good in there, I have been in there before but after today I will go elsewhere.

I used to work next door so I had the pleasure of eating here all the time, you really get to know a place like that. I was never ever disappointed and found them to be really accommodating. The best comfort food ever is sitting at the bar and enjoying their pork sliders with an order of homemade potato chips.

We have gone to the Electric Eel for a couple of years and always felt like we were satisfied but recently figured out that either they have changed their business plan or as one reviewer stated, "is really going downhill". I would much rather they get their act together and get back to providing good but not great food for the money.   The other night we went there and as usual I ordered two spicy tuna hand rolls. Seriously when I was handed the first one there was an inch of seaweed still showing above and beyond the top of the filling! Who does that? Normally the filling is pouring out the top at other sushi bars. So when I asked our chef, he initially ignored me. Giving him the benefit of the doubt but still fuming over the now mini hand roll which has an increased price I did say later on "hey you ignored my question?" to which he immediately responded that Ann, the owner had gotten pissed at him for making them too big and that since she was his boss he had to do what she wanted. Which confirmed that he heard me in the first place and chose to ignore me. I stated that I was the customer and that my feelings were equally important if not more valuable and he just shrugged and deflected any further conversation. It was at that point that we made the decision not to go back. We are so sick of sushi bars that start out great and end with the doors closing and don't plan on spending any more of our hard earned money on a failing business.  Note to owner: You provide good food for a good value or your customers are not happy.  It may be a drive but we will go down to Cactus and Tatum and go to our all time favorite Shogun and make sure that they are still on their game as well as try out some other new places. Sushi is too damn expensive to not have an exceptional dinner anywhere you go.

I took my time the other day to read reviews to find a place to get a quality pedicure and manicure. I booked an appointment with Lyn and made sure to avoid any young guy with tattoos which by the way he is no longer there and of course I asked. Lyn was very nice, took plenty of time to do a great job. The two services were affordable and I appreciated the atmosphere inside the salon. It was busy and it seemed like everyone who walked through the door while I was there, Lyn knew them by name. They hustled to not turn away walk ins but didn't seem to be rushing anyone. I will go again. Be sure to know that it is on the EAST side of Tatum and NOT over by Cocomo Joe's. I was almost late for my appointment trying to find the place. Look for the small strip center on Tatum and Dynamite across from the Cocomo Joe's center.

No stars for this place I had to select one. Make sure you bring your own sweetener and salt as they do not provide condiments of any kind. Tables are filthy, air  conditioning set around 50 degrees and their bread is hard, intentionally.

My husband and I went here last night with a 10% coupon to try it. Walked in and within the first 10 minutes decided to have one roll and leave. However we decided to stay and we were actually glad we did. No it wasn't what we are used to but it managed to deliver some fairly decent sushi and the cost was unbelievable. The quality and taste was definitely there. I liked how they offer 4 piece rolls instead of 8 which allowed me to try more and not get overly full. I am pretty sure we would go back. I would not trade it for my favorite place but at this point not even sure what that is any more.
