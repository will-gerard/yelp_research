Great pizza but the people who work there are extremely unprofessional. They dress like they rolled out of bed

The lady was cutting my toe nails and cut my foot. Wouldn't stop bleeding. And she had the nerve to charge me full price. Extremely unprofessional and didn't even apologize.  Horrible customer service. Didn't make a scene as there were lots of customers. I will not be back. I called the next day to get a refund and they refused

Worst place ever. Homeless live behind the dumpsters. I had an ant problem and several leaks; one case my whole apartment flooded when I was washing my clothes and I woke up to the washer overflowing. I was kicked out of my apartment for 4 days, it was that bad.  Cheap inside and out. Look elsewhere. Only good thing about this place is they give away free rattler tickets.   I feel sorry for the next person who moves Into my old apartment, nothing but trouble.   KEEP LOOKING.
