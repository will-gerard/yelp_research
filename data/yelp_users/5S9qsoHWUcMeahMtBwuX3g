When it's late and everyone else has closed on a weekday, it's either a trip to Delux or a trip to here. When my wallet is weeping, this is the place to go. Their remodel is great and not so cluttered anymore, the place is always packed because the happy hour beer is cheap, service is able to keep up, and so far I haven't had any major qualms. Everything has been quite a good experience and the food is what you would expect from Applebee's. Not extravagant, but not absolutely horrible. Their sirloin choices are perfect for when I want to keep the calories as low as I can at an Applebee's (I really should be going to Sweet Tomatoes next door, but I lack self-control) and they give generous portions for everything.

These people will treat your car and wallet the same way they would like to be treated, period.   NO pressure whatsoever to get you to fix what is recommended and they explain everything in terms that you'll understand, not the bullcrap jargon the dealership tries to bombard you with in their printable fancy booklets 'customized' to tell you everything that is POSSIBLY wrong with your baby while trying to pretend to buy you a soda from the vending machine.  I can't tell you how many times my family and friends have told me how they've brought their own car here to 'test' whether they really need to fix what the dealership suggested and even if it was true, how staggeringly lower $$ they are to fix it. Lexus, Nissan, BMW, they've checked them all.  For example, my boyfriend thought his rear wheel bearing was having issues and even though he's been bringing it here for a while, he wanted to try a BMW specialist. We called Bavarian and they told us it would take a week to get in and an upfront $80-something hour long diagnostic charge. Cool story brah, but definitely not for us poor college-pizza-roll-eating-students.  Brought it in the following day to Camelback,left it there for a few hours, and at the end of the day, come to find out it's only the tire/rim having problems and they didn't charge us a single thing to have it checked out.   So while it doesn't look fancy and could be mistaken as your typical llantera, be smarter than that and give it a try.  How I wish this was a body shop too, but alas, the world is too cruel.

Is their infamous Chicken Fried Everything enough to blow me up into a giant hot air balloon until I go to 'Awesome-Portion-Heaven?' Yes. Is this something I'm gonna regret when I finally drag my body to the gym? Yes, BUT, I argue that you only live once and you should try one of the finest Chicken Fried Steaks around. The only bad thing I will say though is that their gravy is a little bland just by itself. I like mah gravy to taste like it could be an entree of it's own like it should, not as just a topping, but that's just the fatty inside me talking. Also, they get ya by asking if you want some more sauce or more of this, then when the bill comes they tack on extra money without warning me and I can't do anything but a major facepalm.

I own a 'bubble car' as my boyfriend likes to call it. Just a common Toyota Corolla S.. When one of my Goodyear tires needed to be replaced, I figured it wouldn't be a problem, considering that it's a COMMON car so there must be plenty of tires in stock before I go on a mandatory 300 mile road trip the next day.  27 calls later to tire shops ranging from North Scottsdale, Fountain Hills, Tempe, Gilbert, to Avondale, my tires seems to be as elusive as the Fountain of Youth. The thought of me lying in the middle of the desert in 100+ degree heat waiting for vultures to nom on me because I couldn't find a tire was starting to become more real.  My sadistic father, who watched me go through this mid-life crisis finally spoke up and said that there was a really nice guy across the street from where I was this entire time who fixed his car all the time and could probably help me.   Lo and behold, I call and the guy who works there looks it up and says 'We don't have it, BUT I can drive and go get one and be back in 10 minutes.' Why did I not get this response the other 27 shops I tried calling?!   Basically, less than an hour later, my car is done and ready to go. No appointments, no '2 days later', just fast service. The guy I spoke with was really nice, charged me only what was quoted without any hidden labor fees (cheaper than fixing it at the dealership), and told me to not be so hard on my father because he was a 'nice' guy.   We'll see about that.   Giving it 4 stars because I haven't had any other major service done there as others below have, but when I do, which will be very soon as my car brakes are squealing at an ungodly range higher than Mariah Carey's, I will be back to update my review.

I love helping out local, family owned places as opposed to the huge chains but I might have to skip out in this one. Even with the 5 dollar off  coupons that come in the Arcadia coupon books, the price is still too high for the work they provide.  My car needed a good wash after a freakish haboob/bi-polar weather attacked my baby leaving it looking like it had brown chicken pox. The inside wasn't majorly dirty, just some dog hair in the back from my puppy. I waited over a good half an hour for my car but since I had no idea about the wait time nor was I warned beforehand, I was definitely late for work. Yeah, there were a bunch of people which gave me the hope that it was worth it, but there's a same huge crowd at other washes that get the job done faster.  You know when you go through a drive through/self wash, how it always fails to get under the spoiler and the front of the bumper so you end up facepalming and have no choice but to use the good work shirt you're wearing to try to wipe it off . You would think with a hand wash it would be taken care of, but it was like it wasn't even touched or at least worked on enough.  They gave me the keys and there were still spots under the spoiler and specks of dirt still holding onto dear life all around the front. Side mirrors were still spotty and they neglected to simply wipe the inside dash where I had a a few dried up soda stains until I pointed it out and asked them to do so. Vacuum wise though, they did a pretty good job, but nothing I can't find anywhere else.   Save yourself the money and buy the Danny's Car Wash Groupon - 3 for $25 instead of spending 1 wash for $16 here only to still be left with an unfinished wash.

I like to think of this place as a step above Applebees but overshadowed by its cooler big sister Chili's. It's the middle child that never gets any attention and in this case, we really should just forget about it because its only contribution to society is to make us feel pathetic as we leave with our wallets empty and our stomach even emptier.   We had the Yankee Pot Roast. If the Yankees liked their food made with 3/4 of salt, they got it just right. I ordered the pasta and if I were to describe it, it's more of a watered down cream with fusili. Maybe the other location on Camelback is better, but this is the first time we've ever eaten food where it was so bad, we were laughing as we force-fed each other lovingly.  We laughed even more and cried in a fetal position at the same time when we got the check. It wasn't that we weren't expecting the price since we did order an appetizer and drinks - it just hits you that you seriously ate horrible food and can't do anything about it.  I mean I guess you could, but nevertheless you would still lose because you're just a bitter jerk who still ate a horrible meal. You're better off going to Boston Market across the street.

As horrific and barren as this place may seem when you're driving past this place, throw your assumptions away because this place is legit.   I needed to find a place that was closer to me than having to brave the Oregon Trail trek to Sushi Ken and found this gem on Yelp. This is the only place in Arizona where I have eaten tempura the way it's supposed to be done (when you see tempura shrimp that's uniformly round around the edges, that's a no-no.) They have takoyaki and the normal Japanese comfort foods that I have come to love, all cooked by a Japanese elderly couple. Prices are great, portions are enough for you to take some home, and food comes out quick since you're likely to to be the only one in there unless you hit lunch hour where all the MCC kids come trolling over.   They have sushi but I didn't try it and in an establishment like this where it's a little more barren and run down, I will truthfully say that I'm a little scared to try their fish, but I will probably do so in the future and update this post. Definitely worth a try!

Looks like I spoke too soon. It's back to going to 19th Ave and Camelback to get my pho/bbq pork fix.  For those who ask, the owner closed and moved because of what went down. If you want the same menu and food, go to Da Vang because it's within the same family. Phu Thanh moved to the West Valley and just opened inside of Lee Lee's on Cactus Rd.  So for those in Glendale, yay for you! For those who are stuck on the East side, you are welcome to come cry with me in a corner.

Sick of the modern and hip breakfast joints popping up around the valley who serve portion sizes meant for 6 year olds? Wondering why the hell there is kale and quinoa on your plate at a meal meant for bacon and more bacon?   Then rejoice, your wallet and appetite will be overjoyed at this little gem that recognizes the importance of having a breakfast so hearty and fulfilling, you'll sweat nervously - maybe even painfully - at the thought of lunch.   I admit, I am not a true breakfast lover. I eat breakfast at 1:30 PM because I try to avoid the crowd and wait time. Definitely not because I just woke up half an hour before. Yet, I could definitely forgo a burger to come to this place. There are 20 different omelets to satisfy your picky self and when the plates come, you barely have anymore room left on your table to make sure your Tapatio bottle is safe and sound, ready at the go. Potatoes are thick and crisp, and omelets are stuffed like your grandma would have made it.  Service can be a little nonexistent with the girls running around from table to table but it seems like a lot of regulars come so it doesn't bother either party. Definitely, would recommend this place either really early in the day to avoid a wait, or wait until an hour before closing. Beware though, that if you choose the latter - you'll probably be sweating a little while you eat during the Arizona heat. While The Farmhouse has kept most of it's old school decor and charm indoors, it also just happens to have kept the fact that air conditioning is almost non-existent when the place is at capacity.   For Crackers lovers - this just may be THE contender.

Bath, Nails, Anal Gland, Ears, the whole she-bang + a 83 pound 'overly excited and sometimes skittish at the dumbest things known to mankind' puppy that other groomers will deny because they are haters who refuse to take in dogs that don't fit in your purse = 40 bucks out the door.  Yeah, when you go in, you more than likely will question the decor and business. They seem to discourage owners to wait (note absence of any chairs in the huge waiting space they have) and it may seem a little old-school/sketch, BUT when you get your dog back happy, tail wagging at 50 mph, and in less than an hour and a half - nothing else matters.   If this isn't a gift from XL Dogs Anonymous Heaven, let me know asap before my puppy becomes the size of beluga whale.

"Woohoo! As good as it gets!" is pretty much true when you live on the Westside because all there is to eat are chain restaurants and fast food. Living here is like living in Pleasantville, where everything is always the same and everything is tame. If you really know your fish, this is the place to get some of the best and most generous portions of sashimi possible.   I've been to sushi places around the valley and no one cuts their sashimi as thick or has the nice fatty/fish marbling as Sakana does. If you're someone who just eats the more general types of sushi rolls like California rolls or something with just imitation krab and japanese mayo, you're not going to be impressed because you'll probably compare it some other restaurant who made a better krab mix.   If you're someone who is more exotic and is willing to come to a sushi restaurant to eat REAL seafood like squid, roe, sashimi, eel, scallop, or soft shell crab and eat it with as minimal soy sauce and wasabi so you can taste each item as it is before it's doused in seasonings that mask it's real potential, then you will be impressed.   TIP: Go after 7:30. The place is packed, small, and you'll end up waiting for an hour in their non-existent waiting area/small bench if you go any earlier.

Before moving up North, I used to come all the time to this place because my family knew the owners and it used to be near my ex-hairstylist. This is where I realized my intense, borderline dangerous love/addiction for Vietnamese deep fried egg rolls. After eating here, no other place could rival 43rd Express. My family and I always got the same things: pho, egg rolls and spring rolls, and a good ol'  rice dish with pork. I remember how I would just stare at the broth that came with the pho, mesmerized by the big and fatty bubbles that appeared next to the thinly sliced beef and beansprouts floating in all of it's glory. I used to drink that stuff up, as unhealthy as I now realize it to be but I believe that we all need to live on the edge every now and then. Big portions, small prices. Unfortunately, my family switched hairstylists and it just so happened to be conveniently next to Da Vang which is where we go to get our fix now because 43 Express is out of the way. Something about hairstylists within a pho vicinity seems to be a reoccurring pattern for us.   Yes, I agree, this ain't no glamorous place. I remember the occasional annoying fly in the restaurant, the non-existent Asian service, how we always had to wash our chopsticks and spoons in water at the table before we ate, and the mis-matching decor but honestly, the crappier the service/decor inside an Asian restaurant, the better it always tends to be anyways. Hey, no one said we were a perfect race.   Get takeout if you're that picky about interior, but technically, if you already decided to make the trek to this sketchy part of Phoenix, might as well just dine there. If you're used to Da Vang, change it up and try this place out if you don't mind the distance!

If you're not full by the time you're done eating here, you are not human. If you have been here and feel like service was not 'up to par,' 'accommodating.' or 'it's dirty,' you obviously do not know what a real Asian restaurant is like. Believe me, most Asians dgaf when it comes to this but in my opinion, the more they dgaf, the better the food is.   My family have been all around this state trying out Vietnamese restaurants and we have been coming back here despite the distance since I was little. Portions are big and prices are still cheap to this day, what more can you ask for?  No one does egg rolls better than them and no one, in my opinion can do a better pork and rice dish than them. If you're a novice, just simply order a #1: a big fat bowl of pho and nomlicious meat. Squeeze some lime in your broth, add some bean sprouts, and squeeze sriracha sauce and you have a meal fit for a really really obese 17th century king/queen. If you're not so much a noodle fan like I am, order a #41. I bet you have never eaten such succulent fatty pork in your life before. Douse the rice with the fish sauce and eat it all together with the lettuce they give you and you'll know what's going on. Or at least your stomach will.  Top it off with some Vietnamese iced coffee and I'm sure you'll be coming back to this somewhat shady but absolute gem.

If you're a cheap alcoholic, this is your new haven. Soko & Lime, 1 Bud Light, and 2 pitchers of Coors Light = $14. A Long Island was less than $4. Calm your liver down, I kid you not.   It's definitely a place where there is already an established customer base and the bartenders know their names and everyone is chum with each other. If you sit at the bar, you might feel a little uncomfortable at how out of the loop you are, but they're all a pretty friendly group of old timers.   Like others have said, nothing fancy here, but when you're downing copious amounts of alcohol like there's no tomorrow, can you really tell the difference? Food is pretty cheap, especially on burger days. Sometimes, the bartenders will give you a free shot just to spruce up your evening after a day of work.   TVs galore to watch whatever game you want along with pool tables and a Lethal Weapon 2 Pinball machine to which I have donated a blasphemous amount of quarters to. If you're here for Spring Training or just need a place to getaway while your significant other is shopping nearby, try out this dive bar. All I have left to say is that after a long week, this is a great place to unwind without breaking the bank and believe me, no one is judging you here - or at least they can't because they're way more slammed than you.

I've never had a patch of my eyebrows waxed off, but I can proudly say that after almost 7 months of re-growing that heinous empty spot, I now have.   Place isn't as clean as I like my nail salons to be and wait times are excessive as it seems like they are understaffed. Not that I expect nail salons to have a 'welcoming' environment since after all, we're Asian, but definitely not a place to come and bring family or friends. Space is limited and you just get that weird Dark Shadows vibe. Take the time to drive somewhere else or you may end up like me, Patchy McAdams.

Great food can be found anywhere. Great service is one in a million these days. This place gets an A+ in the most awful service I have ever received and if you have/had a Groupon for this place like I did, don't even bother going. You'll be treated worse than a bothersome fly on a hot and humid day.  It's simple. Businesses put  their name out by working with daily coupon sites like Groupon, LivingSocial, etc., to garner new and potential repeat customers. Instead, after going there with my handy coupon, I can't help but drive by this place on the way home and think nothing but the horrible experience I received.   I went with my boyfriend and bought the Groupon because I was impressed due to online reviews and decided to splurge on a good ole' prime rib. We sit down, am impressed with the old school decor, and then the server from Azkaban appears. We tell her that we'd like to order off the special evening menu where it's a little cheaper and tell her joyfully that we found this place through Groupon and that it's our first time. Wrong thing to do. I don't know if it's because past Groupon-ers don't tip well or something, but I could swear her smile immediately turned 180 degrees in an instant.   It took our food (the chicken and prime rib) almost 33 minutes to come out. All we did was nom ... and nom ... and nom on the watery coleslaw and gritty liver (which isn't to blame since I was never a liver fan). Not once did our server come by our table. We watched her run into the kitchen and either not come back out for a while or attend to other tables. It was another server that came out and gave us our food so we let our frustration go since it wasn't her fault and there's no use in calling her out for nothing. We asked if she knew where our server was, and she said she would look for her. 10 minutes later, nothing, yet it was the new server who kept coming back, asking if everything was alright like a normal server should.   Then it was time for the check and we just wanted to get out of there since we were basically ignored. 17 minutes pass, no check came even though our  table had been cleared. Our server was still MIA so we asked a random server to give us our check. He said he would tell our server to bring it back and we told him straight up that we didn't even want to see her face so another random server brought it back.  We had a table of 4 sitting next to us who even leaned over and asked us why we were being so calm when our non-existent server was treating us like crap. We didn't even want to bother waiting another 20 minutes just to talk to a manager since apparently the only way the servers here communicate is by playing Telephone so we just left after paying. The table beside us told us that they were going to complain for us since we wanted to leave, but whether they did or not I didn't even care at that point.   To be honest, I can't even remember what the food tasted like, which isn't quite fair in a review. I went here a couple of months ago, but I have never had an experience where service overrode the taste of food. I'm pretty sure prisoners in a cafeteria get more attention than I did.  Maybe it wasn't even the Groupon. Who knows. All I know is that we ran out of there like Usain Bolt and tell anyone who asks about our worst dining experience that this is the place to experience it.

I could write an essay about how amazing this place is. The employees really care and go out of their way to help you give the best to your dog. Yeah, feeding your dog with more higher quality food is expensive, but given the high number of recalls in the dog food  you find at PetSmart every month, do you wanna risk your best friend's life? Am I going to carelessly let my beast get sick when she's been such a brat and racked up so much $$$ in hospital visits over the dumb stuff she's done? Nuh-uh. This beast is stuck with me, she ain't getting the easy way out.   I used to buy Canidae but when they decided to jack prices up, the owner took his time to introduce me to a different brand just as good that fit my budget since I'm in there every month to feed the ox/whale hybrid I have at home. You won't get a boring lecture, but I can guarantee you'll walk out with more helpful information than you came in with.  It's funny, sometimes I'm browsing and the owner will straight out tell me that certain products in the shop aren't that great of an option for my dog and is just waiting for it to die off the shelf in due time. Honesty is something you will definitely find here and it's what keeps me coming back.  Also, if you have a large breed, come here for the industrial size tennis balls and cow bones. So so so cheap compared to other stores.

I feel like Ron Burgundy as he bashes frozen yogurt for trying to be anything like his beloved ice cream and tries to give it zero stars. In this case, how dare you call your "chicken katsu" .... chicken katsu.   I've been craving chicken katsu for days and saw this place during my errands. To keep it short, when you order chicken katsu you will not get chicken katsu, not even close. You will instead get barely fried/soft pieces of chicken (think teriyaki chicken); not even the right breading nor the right part of the chicken they usually use. Also, they will give you Katsu sauce, but it's really hoisin sauce. I thought all of this was a horrible mistake, but that's how they do things there. Talk about confusing and misleading, I feel like I ordered a hamburger and got a fish filet instead.

Burgers are bomb and fresh just as they should be. This is a no frills, cash only, sit, eat, please gtfo and leave asap so more people can sit down joint. Because it's so simple, there's not much to go into detail about.   Fries could be bigger because they remind me of the fries that came in my happy meal when I was 5, but that's just me and my fatty-ness roaring out loud. I heard that they used to take M&G, if that is true, then Chuckbox, Y U NO ACCEPT MY TAX FREE MEAL CARD?!!  Parking can be a pain in the butt sometimes, so watch where you park. There's about 8798723 red and white signs telling you that if you make the wrong choice, the odds will not ever be in your favor and Tempe towing will gladly make your night a living hell.

With 500+ reviews, I doubt anyone needs anymore convincing to try out a Delux burger ... unless they happen to be blind. I've been here countless times and there isn't much deviation from the norm. Delux sushi? Now that's something to talk about.   After combining Zen 32, I've been reluctant to try their sushi bar. Their sushi prices  could maim my already slim wallet. $14 a roll? I say 14 a no. Unless it's happy hour, I suggest going somewhere else that serves sushi for less if you're that desperate to satisfy your sushi craving. Then again, you're at Delux. Just stay and get a goddamn burger.   But when mom and dad calls saying that I should take a break from studying and take me out to dinner ? HELL YEAH I GOT TIME FOR DAT.  I've tried the Vegas Roll and Caterpillar and I have to say, one plate was enough to fill me. Quality was good, portions were decent, and presentation was clean and eye-catching as well. Being the typical nosy Asian mom, she kept pointing out how the sushi chef was practically standing, getting paid to do nothing on a busy Sunday night. I assume he gets more orders during Happy Hour.    The only qualm I have is that when he finally did get an order, he would make it really quick, but would then leave it on a rack until a server came to pick it up. I understand that burgers may take longer than sushi to make, but when I watch him make my sushi and leave it out for 5+ minutes even though I'm sitting RIGHT next to him, I'm a little peeved. It's fish, you don't leave it out like that you know? Even if the server is just trying to make sure all the orders come to the table at once, it just really irked me.   Other than that though, I say burger or sushi, try it all.

They definitely need to re-train the new sushi chef. He looked offended and even went as far as ignoring my boyfriend who brought my Vegas Roll to his bar and told him that the eel was missing. He just looked away and kept talking to another before he was so 'rudely' interrupted. Our server helped us out asap so it wasn't that much of a problem, but the sushi chef definitely needs an attitude change.   Prices have gone up and portions have gone down. What used to come as a trio (slides) is now a duo. Not sure how to feel about that as I understand the pricing in the restaurant industry yet it still seems a little unfair. Regardless though, I'll still come here because it's the only place open so late.

Came here for almost an entire year and stepped out of the gates poop free every time. Large space, 2 dog fountains, and trash bags galore to pick what you should be picking up. I'm talking to all you "summer's eve" who pretend to not look or catch when their dogs take a good ol' Stanley Steamer.  You always see the same group of people if you come in at the same time everyday. You'll see the old people with the lawn chairs gathered in a half circle when it's not even human to be up so early and you'll meet the same chill crowd in the evenings who talk about the last sports game.   My dog was never bit here unless it was playful nipping and I never saw more than 2 instances the whole I was there, but it's to be expected by the few owners who are too busy yapping/spending their whole damn time on their phones instead of paying attention.  Just don't come after 7 or 8-ish when the meaner dogs/more careless owners come. You know it's time to reach for the leash and leave when a big guy comes in with 3 chained beasts who gang up and lunge for the nearest toy poodle savagely and one of the beasts' names turns out to be Blackout -_-  Just remember the schedule when they water the grass or else you'll drive to a locked dog park every 2 weeks and have to drag your dumb a** all the way to Indian Steele which isn't the best option because the owners there are of a "different" kind who don't even let other dogs share the same water as their dogs, but it'll do while it's out of service and you'll sometimes even see the same people there too with their dogs.

I get inhumanely and unhealthily hysterical if we are not at a movie theater at least 40 minutes before a showing. The only other theaters near me is Tempe Marketplace or I can drive to Chandler Mall; it's the equivalent of asking me whether I'd like to walk on a bed of stones set on fire or on a path filled with metal spikes tipped with poison. After having to sit through the Lego movie listening to 'Everything is Awesome' (Nonstop-crying-baby-with-a-mom-who-is-too-selfish-to-leave-because-she's-too-into-the-movie Remix), I gave up on going to the busy movie theaters and decided to just stick with coming here.  Even on opening night/day, I don't think I've ever had to worry about getting a good seat. The other night, I arrived 5 minutes after previews for the new 300 sequel (I almost had a heart attack in the hallway) and still got middle seats just where I like. Their popcorn bucket deal here is worth it if you go to the movies a lot, 3 dollars to refill. It's never really crowded, quiet, and clean. Seats are just like Harkins, comfortable and able to recline back and forth unlike the sadists at AMC. Yes, the theaters are smaller then what we're used to, but with lower prices and no crowds, it doesn't make a difference to me in the end.  They also have an old school Spiderman pin ball machine here that I like to spend an ungodly amount of quarters on with the boyfriend. It's a night of simple fun, just the way I like it when the week has been weary and full of dumb drivers on the highway.

We held a banquet in December 2012 on a Saturday for a party of about 30 people, give or take at the actual Heidi's location. Heidi worked with our budget and was extremely responsive in the beginning which we were extremely grateful for. We had a 3 course meal consisting of salad, beef bourguignon, and an assortment of desserts. Nothing tasted weird or anything when were eating it at Heidi's and the guests thought the food was good. The party went well, awards were given out, and all of us were happy that another successful formal banquet had been planned and passed without any hardship.  *Cue Horror Music*   Come  the following Sunday and Monday, all of my friends are falling sick left and right, dropping like flies. One even passed out on the bathroom floor at 3 am and had to be sent to the ER. All of them were complaining of the same symptoms: throwing up, fevers, stomach-aches, tiredness, etc. I didn't know what was going on until we all realized that over 3/4 of the guests present at the formal banquet was sick.   Our social chair contacted Heidi's and their very first response was "we're sorry to hear that YOUR party has fallen ill" but it wasn't their fault because their cooks ate the same meal as us that night and they were not sick.   First of all, this wasn't just "our party" because Heidi's hosted it and fed us so they neglected to accept any responsibility at all. Secondly, while your employees may be well, it should be the customer's well-being that you are concerned about instead of just waving it off like no big deal.It's as if a guest walked over a certain part of the floor and slipped and hurt herself, but the chef had walked over the same part and was fine so it's no problem. Thirdly, Heidi's tried to point out that their staff eavesdropped on our guests planning to go somewhere afterwords so we must have contracted it at the location they went after. While what they heard was true, this lame excuse was proven false as most of our guests actually went straight home right after, including those who were most sick afterwords.   After I was made social chair in January, I tried to pick up after our last Social chair who e-mailed Heidi's for a solution but after back and forth statements that none of it was their fault, they stopped e-mailing and left it at them still trying to side-step away from getting almost an entire party ill.   While I understand that many others below have had great experiences with Heidi's, I only wish our guests could have received the same as well. I'm not entirely suggesting that you not contact their catering as an option for your next event because it seems like we were the first case, but I'm definitely not going to advocate for it either.   P.S. Might I add that our entire party was made up of college students. Particularly, college students who have iron stomachs; stomachs that have digested food & beverage combinations unseen or unheard of. It's hard to get us sick. Just saying.

Their lobster & crab mac n cheese is a dish I like to categorize in my prestigous "jizzing in thy pants worthy"   Nomnomlicious as it is though,  as a college student with an empty/dusty wallet that is always there to remind me that I, 99% of the time, am not allowed to indulge and happily jizz my pants, I cannot get what jesus christ probably ate at his Last Dinner.   Fear not though, that's where their daily specials save the day and for roughly less than 10 bucks, I can satisfy myself with their filling and hearty bruschetta while my boyfriend makes love to his beloved drunk italian sodas in a way I've never been treated to before.

I'm not ashamed to say that I am a Ross whore/groupie/addict.   I've been to plenty from Gilbert to Glendale and this is pretty much one of the few where the shelves are always full and you'll always find new things no matter when you go. I think it's because it's so near to campus that they always get new inventory unlike the quieter ones where they tend to hold onto an item for longer so the choices aren't that great. This is pretty much where I get everything now, from kitchen to closet. Michael Kors scarf, Steve Madden heels galore, Olivia + Joy purses, huge canvas art, the George Forman grill that saved me from near starvation ... I'm always able to find something for me. I'm not really into actual clothes from Ross so I can't judge on that, but when it comes to the amount and variance in purses, shoes (tons of name brands), and housewares (a poor HGTV fan's dream), they definitely got it right in that department.   Tip: Avoid during Christmas season. Oddly, I cannot find anything during that time and with the number of people who rummage through, it turns into what could be a backdrop from Slumdog Millionaire.

Hooters wings are practically the same everywhere and I have to say that no one can do 'breaded' like they do. I want meh some crispiness and boy, do they cater. Other than that though, this hooters has nothing special about it other than the fact that it is on Mill and convenient when you're balls to the wall drunk.  I went on a Wednesday night with a group of friends and the food came out in a reasonable time.   When I say reasonable, only if they were waiting in the kitchen for the actual egg to hatch, then wait for the baby chick to grow until it's an adult, de-feather it, and fry it fresh. This is how it felt waiting for our food and by the time the food actually came to the table, all the server AND the manager could keep repeating was 'we're on last call and about to close, do you want anything else?"   Well damn son, I just got my food and it's not our fault we had to wait until closing for our food to be ready.   A lot of the people I went with had to get up and go to the bar just to ask for water to be refilled because the server was so boggled and non-existent. Plates, drinks, utensils, nothing was ever given when asked even though we asked our server. I asked her for a box 3 times and she acknowledged but never came back once with it. This 'Styrofoam contraption'  was too hard for her to comprehend so I finally had to go searching for one on my own.   Two stars for the usual good wings, but nothing else for the non-existent service.

Food was pretty good, obviously better than your normal Panda Express meal. Portions were nice and family-sized and the place was packed like always. Overpriced in my opinion just like Pei Wei which is why I don't go. I would much rather go to Abacus Inn and get more for my money.   Why 2 stars? I went with a group of 12 for a birthday celebration. We told the waiter that we would like to pay separate. She told us that was not possible because of the 18% gratuity and there was no such option on the cash register. o.0 "Eh?"  We all looked at each other for a minute in silence and told her that it's been done before and we would just split the 18% on all bills. For some reason, she comes back with our whole table's receipt, gives us one pen, and then tells us that we would need to divide it up ourselves and then leave the correct amount for her to pick up not forgetting to include the 18% per person plus tax. "Use the back empty side of the receipt for scratch paper," she said.  This became a 30 minute ordeal as half of us scrambled to get our phone calculators out while the other half tried to get in touch with a manager who for some reason did not exist and it was the hostess who came to apologize and then just promptly left to go back to her position. What was supposed to be a birthday celebration became a sudden blast from Pre-Algebra past.   Pure laziness or stupidity? Either way, a major Facepalm moment on their part.

My dog has a sensitive stomach and has to eat natural stuff. Is it a pain in the booty? Yes. Does my dog eat better than I do every month? Sadly, since after paying big bucks for her food I'm usually stuck with McDonalds for a few days afterwords. But after going from pet store to feed tacks, this is the only place I've found so far that has the best pricing on my little spoiled turd/puppy's Canidae dry food.   This is more of a food place, not much of a dog accessories or supply store. If you don't feed your dog any fancy stuff like human-grade food or canned squid, just go to your local Petsmart, but for natural food this is a convenient place to go. Could you find some dog treats on Amazon for cheaper? 90% of the time, yes, but if you need the food ASAP and are willing to pay $1-3 more than it usually would so you don't have to wait for it to ship out, this is a great local place to support.  ALSO, they give out a ton of free samples for you to try out and being the secret cheap hoarder that I am, I always grab some for my dog to try. The staff are more than happy to give you a ton and explain to you the pros and cons of each.

I wish I could say something. Anything. But, all I got is nothing, because that's what I got before I left the most craptastic table known to mankind.  I never heard of this place before until a friend suggested that I go because they were having their 5 year anniversary special. If I liked it, my job was to report back to my entire sorority so they could try it out on another day and we would be a group of happy fatties. If I didn't, at least I didn't pay full price. My sister and I were pumped to go as it would be a new experience in Old Town. My phone was charged; I was gonna take an ungodly amount of photos of my food. I called to make reservations and they told me that they had limited tables and I would be at a high-top table. I'm not usually one for such seating but I understood that they would be packed so I took it with joy and excitement.  I got there early and checked-in with the hostess who said that my table was ready and all they had to do was clean it. You know the feeling when they lead you to a table next to the kitchen entrance, the bathroom, or some reckless child throwing spaghetti who needs to be tied up Silence of the Lambs style? Well, let me challenge that.  They had moved a high-top table from the bar area into the lit walkway where everyone walked in and out, but pushed it toward the wall where there was absolutely no light. I thought Cornish Pasty was dark, but where it was placed, I needed to turn my phone on just to talk to my sister across the little 2 ft. wide table. You could tell that a table wasn't supposed to be put there because well ... it was a walkway. If a party of more than 4 was coming through, one of us would definitely be bumped into. It only had 2 chairs, 2 settings but I reserved for 3. They said they knew and would set it up, even though I looked and the table was already clean and set? We waited for about 20 minutes and finally hunger overtook my sister who got up and asked if we could sit down. They told the same excuse to us they told everyone else 'We're waiting for some tables to move." My hopes for a better table soared like an American Eagle, but not another second longer did they shut down my dreams like the government. They pointed to the same table, and we awkwardly sat down ... while my boyfriend stood up waiting for the chair they still hadn't placed. There were at least 4 employees standing at the hostess podium, 2 feet away, just walking around my boyfriend like he had suddenly turned into stone.   The chair came 5 minutes later, but only because of my boyfriend's invisible yet oh so intense laser beam eyes gored into the back of their heads. No menus were given to us the entire time we sat. Once again, we are sitting so close to the hostess podium, I could play patty-cake with them. Then we waited until our server came, who immediately told us that we couldn't sit there if we were just waiting for a table, and that we would have to excuse ourselves to the bar area.   That was pretty much the last straw. Not even cheap Chili's would give this kind of rude service. My sister told her that we were her table but we were leaving. I walked the 2 steps over to the 4 hosts who looked baffled as to why we was leaving, but even a 3 year old watching Dora could have figured it out quicker than them.  We left and walked over to HiFi disgruntled, but even there we got better service even with the unwanted boobies all up in our faces.   Basically, I am appalled at what happened. I understand that you're packed with such an awesome special going on but lord did they over-estimate the crowd, taking reservations when they shouldn't have, giving tables to customers that not even a cave troll would deserve, and the lack of communication between the front of the house and the dining floor. People go out of their way to try new places and if you can't be organized without being blinded by profit, why should we as customers waste gas just to be shafted. We left so frustrated and sad, not even getting the slightest chance to try anything that we had drooled over previously through Yelp photos. Not even a freaking glass of water.

Stay away from this park. The dogs that frequent this park belong as extras/stand-ins for Cujo.  I left Washington Park when I moved to be closer to school and this little park was my only closest option. My dog was never aggressive until she had to defend herself here. All the dogs swarm to the gates when you come (a behavior that makes the incoming dog extremely nervous even aggressive), the owners don't pick up after their dog with the excuse that there are no bags provided, there is no little/big dog separation, and most of the dogs aren't trained to even come to their owner in case of an event. It's like a meth lab waiting to explode.   On a busy night, you can literally walk in and feel the tension between the dogs. My last time there, it was extremely busy but I still let my dog in because she's never had any problems before. All the dogs teamed up and chased my 90lb baby the moment she got in and the owners (mostly college students) literally just stared dumbfounded and watched until she snapped back to defend herself. Then I was the one being glared at and given the stink-eye like it was my fault.  I'm sorry, I didn't know I just stepped into Michael Vick's backyard by accident instead of the dog park.  I had to re-socialize my dog at one of the fancy, for-rich people indoor doggy daycare (thank heavens for Groupon) and finally, 1 1/2 years later, my dog can finally step foot in a dog park. She's still prone to ignore other dogs and doesn't tend to be very social with the dogs in the park, but it's a step in the right direction. Wish I had never gone here.

Couldn't choose between the ribs or the Luau pork plate and the waiter recommended the pork. I thought it was all right, but they sure doused it in 12 gallons of soy sauce and sort of over did it with the sweet pineapples. After being forced to eat white rice every night for the past 19 years due to a very persuasive/aggressive Asian mother, I vowed to stop eating it when I got out of the house but because it was so overly sweet and salty, I had to ask for more of the rice that came with it just to mellow my mouth out.   While I should give it 3 stars, I can honestly say that you cannot beat their happy hour prices. Thanks to this place, my boyfriend and my wallet are both happy and he's able to drop his 'macho' guard, He now happily drinks Orange Martinis and Mai Tai's, but at Hula's. Anywhere else and it's back to his manly Samuel Adams and Four Peaks. Le sigh.

Trying to get a hold of the receptionist here to make an appointment is harder than trying to find Osama Bin Laden. At least Bin Laden was found, I still have yet to hear any response from this establishment.   Apparently, there's only one person you can talk to to make an appointment and she never picks up her phone. I end up playing phone tag with her voicemail for days on end. Even the service representatives at Camelback Toyota gave me business cards for other local businesses when I told them about my problem instead of trying to get hold of them.  I eventually researched on Yelp and found Penske Automotive on Hayden Rd. who took care of the huge black hole in my rear bumper in less than a week.

Let's talk about vaginas.  I was going through a rough time where the lower half of me was not being very nice to me and I thought that it was transforming on it's own and my life was going to turn into that independent movie "Teeth." Having Dr. Glassman at my side to investigate this matter for what would be the next grueling 6 months was amazing to have. You're always welcomed into his office for a briefing/consultation, he's extremely professional and discreet (front staff maybe not so much), and every time I had a medical freak-out, he was there to answer my call and even get me in the same day within the hour.  He found out that it was a gnarly benign polyp and I had two separate operations on me - one in the hospital to successfully eradicate it. Ever since then, I've barely had any issues with my body and he's been working with me on getting the right birth control since my body seems to have a habit of rejecting them. Apparently my body wants the babies.    What took my old gynecologist 9 months with a check-in/waiting time of 2-3 horrific 'kill-me-now' hours, Dr. Glassman solved in one try and I always seem to be the only person in the waiting room when I go. His staff even tolerated me when I was high on anesthesia yelling nonsense and stumbling around the office like a drunk hobo. Even with insurance, he can be a little bit pricey (in my poor college student opinion), but he doesn't pressure you into doing anything you're not comfortable with, is upfront with the costs when you ask for it, and plenty of samples for you to try before you buy.  Fun fact: He met my boyfriend after my operation and I guess the bf left such an impression that my doctor felt the need to immediately give me an unnecessary amount of birth control samples. Always looking out, this one. Plus, did I mention he's the only one who gets my extremely unnecessary/sick humor? Score.

As Social Chair for my sorority at ASU, I had the oh-so-fun task of setting up our 1st Annual Year End Party and our Pledge Banquet at the same time in a span of only one month. I did so much research and called so many places that I suddenly went from full-time student to full-time event planner. I came upon 12 West Main on a random search and they have been nothing but helpful and responsive. They gave a way better price and were more than happy to work with an amateur who was slightly disorganized, making everything happen within that small time span. Guests who came loved the staff and venue itself. The catering was delicious and I couldn't have asked for more. Definitely take the time to call them up first before you start calling around like a telemarketer and you can definitely find what you're looking for if you tell them your vision and your price range.

I ended up on Main St. after doing some planning at 12 West Main and I remember being so hungry afterwords, I could eat a small infant (don't worry, I didn't).  Main St. is hard to describe ... it has some cool places like the Mesa Arts Center & the Museum of Natural History, but the other shops in what's supposed to be a hip urban downtown street are so desolate and barren, it reminds me of a forgotten Wild West Town. My friend and I didn't want to eat 'fast food' pizza which is the about the only thing you can get besides Subway on this entire street, and we saw this weird joint in the middle of it all that was a sit down restaurant. We decided to just try it before out stomachs began eating our own intestines.   The place was empty. That was my first impression and when you see an empty place you're kind of hesitant to even try it. I'm so glad we didn't leave. The lady recommended us a certain burger when we asked what was good and we each had root beer floats (a little watery, but it came straight from the legit brown bottles), and the food came in a timely manner. The patty size was HUGE for the small price accompanying it and my friend and I agreed that this was the FIRST burger we ever ate that wasn't greasy AT ALL, yet still held a good amount of flavor. I don't know how else to describe it, but it was just a genuinely good burger, fresh ingredients, no frills, and I didn't feel bad after eating the entire thing oddly.   The major reason I liked this place was because of this: You know when you're in an empty restaurant in those weird afternoon hours and the hostess or whoever tries to hurry you out so they can go back to concentrating on their phones, ipads, etc. The owners let us stay until we were too tired to talk and didn't care how loudly we laughed or anything. It was like I was eating dinner with a friend in my own living room comfortably and that, is hard to find.   Obviously, this is no 5 star burger with not even a 2 star decor, but the place is exceptionally clean, staff leaves you alone to do what you want, and if you happen to find yourself on this weird, empty, place called Main St., come to this odd little place that will qualm your confusion if just for a little with some darn good food.

It's a love-hate relationship with this place, especially for those who understand how non-existent the late night scene is in northern Phoenix. Our choices are limited so I'm usually stuck with here or Salty's in Glendale, which is just a blast from my high school past that I'd like to ignore. Believe me, the choice makes me want to gauge my eyes out too.  It was packed because of the UFC game when I went and you could hardly get around the sausage fest with everyone awkwardly standing and roaring, let alone try to wave down a bartender to get you a drink. When you did though, I will say that the girls are extremely nice, attentive, and quick. Does it overcome the horror when I see how much it costs for just a couple of drinks? Unfortunately not. Definitely a place where you'll have to get a little skeezy if you want something other than H20. Friends were telling me that it gets better when the music turns because everyone actually starts moving around, but the UFC fight had just barely started and I was dreading standing around in heels in the cold with the outdoor heaters not doing any favors for me.   As if on cue though, someone from above felt the pain in my calves and SIlva's career died in front of my very eyes. The UFC crowd left and music began. Crowd consists mostly of MILFS and ordinary looking guys who come alone dancing by themselves hoping for something, if anything. Definitely an extremely milder version of Mill with a male to female ratio of 3:1. Good dance music though, played a lot of 2000's hip hop.   Can't judge on food as I didn't get any, but I'd say that it's worth the extra money and time to go somewhere else or end up awkwardly standing next to a Mexican statue trying to get a drink for the next 15 minutes.

Not really sure what all the hoopla is about for this place. Overpriced and food was mediocre - my local neighborhood Italian restaurant does better at half the price.   We ordered the sopressata pizza, the short rib pasta, and the lobster and rock shrimp pasta. The slices of mozzarella on the pizza wasn't melted on the pizza and was actually so heavy and still in it's original form that it slid right off due to its weight. The 'short rib' pasta that I had just looked, felt, and tasted like it was just ground beef. The taste wasn't anything memorable,until I realized it tasted just like Chef Boyardee (I went through a scary but so satisfying canned food phase in middle school). Pasta wasn't cooked all the way either. The lobster and rock shrimp was pretty good, but not a dish to order if you're hungry as portions were pretty small.   In essence, this is the probably one of the few places where I left food on my plate and didn't ask for a to-go box. Sometimes, I'll even ask for a box and just throw it away the moment I get home due to guilt, but I really didn't want to see it again. I literally have never felt that bad as I could imagine my tiger mother screaming in my head about how there's a bunch of other starving asian kids in the Phillipines or something to that effect.   If you're looking for great pasta, literally just take one step left and head to Scarpetta where the environment and service is actually wonderful or turn around and head down the hallway next to Jaleo and grab some awesome pizza. The next day I went to The Henry downstairs and even though the menu was more d cafe like, I wish I would have gone there instead of wasting my money here.

I came here for a simple eyebrow wax and instead was the victim of a mini WWE struggle.   The lady kept using my chest as a coffee table to steady herself even though I asked her not to but she just told me to hold still and proceeded to keep using the people's elbow on me. My eyebrows came out uneven and they were trimmed too short.   The interior is pretty bland, just all white and empty. so if you're the type that likes getting their nails done where there's a painted sky on the ceiling with Greek columns, flat screens left on Travel Channel, and the whole shebang, go somewhere else. Maybe I'll try the other location seeing as they have better reviews? I don't know if my chest can take another beating though.

I think I just found my new favorite lunch spot and as much as my helpless body had hoped it would be some healthy, green-chic organic place, it's not, because this extra ordinary place with its' simple and short menu has just literally blown me away in smithereens.   You know how Jimmy John's has a light up neon sign that says 'Free Smells?' They should be dead ashamed of themselves and tear it down because the moment you walk through this place, it is nirvana to your smelling senses. That freshly baked butter smell hits you and all you want to do is just twirl around like you're a kid at Disneyland. You can tell that everything here is homemade and made in small batches, from the limited number of pies they have in the case to the small drink dispensers. Rather inexpensive, 4.99 a pie and they have coupons to use right there at the front counter. There's not much room to sit and eat, it's more of a come and go kind of place and that's okay because pies are easy to eat that way.   I ordered the chicken and mushroom pie and it was so warm and flaky. Inside, it had huge chunks of mushroom and real shredded chicken with a sauce that was so decadent, it reminds me of the stews that take hours to make. More personally, it reminded me of all the savory pastries I used to eat when my parents took me to Le Madeleine (rip). At first when you look at the pie, you're probably thinking it won't fill you up - which you're probably right, you need two. But depending on what filling you get, halfway through the rich and tender filling it suddenly hits you like a brick in the stomach and surprises you at the same time. It doesn't mean that I didn't finish it though, because John Cena doesn't quit and neither do I.   I know I should be talking and reviewing about the filling more but in my case, I NEED to talk about the puff pastry. As a cook, puff pastry is one of the hardest things to make from scratch, period. It is one of the most fickle things to handle and one change in temperature can kill the 'puff' in 'puff pastry.' When you watch cooking/baking shows, all the chefs use puff pastry from the frozen aisle, never made from scratch. Even as they prepare the frozen sheet of pastry, they warn viewers not to handle it too much. It's also kind of expensive in my opinion too, but when you realize how hard it is to make it, it slightly makes sense. The fact that this local place is basing its business entirely on puff pastry blows my mind and it's literally some of the best that I've had. I can't wait to try their croissants next.   I didn't try this place for the longest time because from afar, I have no idea why, but the sign made it look like a vape shop. I'm glad we have Yelp because without it I wouldn't have even stepped inside this plaza to try this place. Only con? It's not open on Mondays, the day of the week where I need something this heavenly to remind me that everything will be okay, even if I did neglect to do all the chores I meant to do the weekend before.

Came here with the boyfriend who was skeptical of this place because he doesn't see the difference between going to get his hair cut professionally and the usual me shaving his head  in the kitchen into something that resembles a misshapen-ed salad bowl.   We came with a Livingsocial deal and our first impression was that it was had a very unique and cool mood going on. The bf lit up at their beer specials and I have to say that for 2 bucks a Stella and everything else, it's a good deal whether or not you come for a haircut. Tried the food and it wasn't anything too special when you could just walk a couple of shops down to TK tavern.  Here's the problem: We came in, told them about the coupon we had, and then we had to wait for a stylist even though there was a stylist just chilling with nothing to do and other walk-ins without the coupon went before us. After our last horrifying groupon experience, this alerted my boyfriend that we were going to get a sh*t-tastic experience here as well because we're 'those with the coupons.' Finally he got a barber, asked for a simple number 3 haircut but to leave the top of his hair long. Instead, the barber just buzzed off all of his hair until he looked like a monk and did an even crappier job shaving off his sideburns, leaving him with patches. We were done in less than 5 minutes whereas everyone else getting their haircut were attended to like they were supposed to.  My boyfriend was embarrassed and just wanted to get out, because it's the second time it's happened we've gotten second-rate treatment because of our 'coupon.' If the owner is a bald guy, then he was there and even directed us to this specific barber who didn't talk or anything, just shaved and was told us he was done. Save yourself the money and go to your local barbershop who will treat you right without the expensive costs and actually listen to your needs without judging you.

Both locations are the same distance from my place so I've washed my dog at both. If you want one that's bustling with others washing their dogs, staff is friendlier and more interactive, and afterwords you can easily find a popular and convenient place nearby to grab a drink or snack with your buddy, then head to the one on 7th Avenue  If you have a beast of a dog who is skittish at the dumbest things, thinks she's too good to be near any water, and you don't want anyone to awkwardly bother/pity stare at you while you wrestle for an hour just to put some shampoo on this said beast, then head on to this quieter location. No one will bother you or judge you at this location, not even the employees. I guarantee it.   I also love that they give you a bunch of unlimited free treats to spoil your dog. Beware though, if your dog likes to chase cats, they have 2 orange cats that lounge by the cash register all the time so hold on to that leash tight.   If you live in the Arcadia area, try to get your hands on their coupons that comes in the mail in the Arcadia community booklet. It usually has a coupon for a 5 dollar self wash (savings of 8-10 bucks!) and some percentage off their pet food.

I'm surprised this place doesn't have more reviews. Trying to get a table every weekend morning is like trying to get your hands on that $2.00 LCD TV on Black Friday unless you want to fry on the patio.  No matter what you order, you can definitely split it between two people. Even if you order some 'egg white only and a bunch of other things to keep my skinny ass thin' type meal, the add-ons like bagel/toast, potatoes, etc. are there to make sure you don't leave  without having to massively scoot yourself back from the table to avoid your now tadpole-like filled stomach from injuring anything on your way out.   When it gets busy, the servers tend to disappear from time to time, but at 10 am in the morning while I nurse myself from whatever happened Friday night, the less talking the better. Also, food and drinks sometimes take a while, definitely short-handed. Poor workers are running around like it's the Kentucky Derby. Sometimes it's a hassle just to find a host who will seat you because they're running around too.  The best bang for your buck by far is the steak and eggs. Huge omelette-shaped hash brown, warm bagel with cream cheese, scrambled eggs covering half the plate, and a massive flattened tender sirloin all for 11 bucks. Did I mention 2 for 1 Bloody Mary's on Sunday?   Place has become such a favorite that I brought about 15 other friends and they all loved it just as much as their wallets did. To those who knew this as Taylor's Place and complain about how it used to be the best, yada yada yada, who cares. It's gone, so you might as well shut up and eat up at Daily Bistro or go to your local IHOP because it's here to stay.

Confused.  That sums up my experience. When they were about to open, they had pictures of their snoh on plates but when I get there, we get froyo cups. Some people have dishes, I don't. Problem with that is that they put so much snoh in the cups, they pretty much cheat you with the toppings. I can't stress how little they give you and even with so little, there's no room to mix it in the cup. So, even though you've compromised, took a couple of calming breaths, and came to terms with the abysmal amount of toppings, 4 spoonfuls in there's no toppings and you're left with strawberry albeit bland snoh. Might as well slam your head into the table in defeat because you pretty much just paid for sugar syrup and ice.  I came with family and everyone's snoh was different. Some were soft like it's supposed to (strawberry), but some where so compact and hard like a brick (taro). My family are natives so they definitely didn't think it was THAT worth it to drive down to Phoenix to try it. Cherry blossoms next door is 3x more worthy to drive down for.  There's a new Snow that opened in the Mekong plaza so I'll try it, but my expectations won't be so high next time. As for others, it's a new and exciting concept and I understand that there's already nothing Asian-related in this desert, but just calm your titties down because it's not as great at the hype surrounding it claims to be.

This is probably one of the weirder reviews I'll ever write. When I rate something 5 stars, not only does the food have to be hallucination-inducing, uncontrollably drooling awesome, but so does the service itself. In this case, the service pretty much is non-existent and confusing to the core but they have me whipped, chained, and weak at the knees for their food.   Eddie owns the place and he's pretty awesome at what he does. The flavors are so intense and so on point but not only that, they're kind of visually stunning as well. Be mesmerized by how intensely pink the beet hummus is or be nervous when you see how many green fresh jalapeno specks there are in the cilantro hummus. Their rice is a beautiful saffron golden color and always fluffy like a pillow. Their meats, especially their lamb and beef ... would you like some meat with your steamy meat juices? Because that's how succulent they are. Everything is just an explosion of flavor because of how many herbs and spices they use in each dish. I will warn you that by eating their potatoes, you should plan on not speaking to anyone for the next 8 hours because it is just deliciously bombarded with an obnoxious amount of garlic.   I order catering all the time for my workplace and the moment the work floor get an email that there's Hummus Xpress - they drop everything for it. These full grown men are willing to sit still through a 45-minute vendor presentation that probably doesn't even relate to what they do just to be able to enjoy the food rather than go out for lunch themselves. In our world, that's some major dedication.   Service? Let's just say it's been a trip. Sometimes when I call to order, their phone line doesn't work and they just don't fix it - just because. So then you're stuck for 3 months having to resort to ordering something else while you live on edge that your insatiable coworkers might jump you. Finally get a hold of them? Kitchen fire - closed. Need a catering order? E-mail it and hope that they show up at the time you requested because they never responded or asked for payment. Get the receipt - not even sure what they charged you for but it looks about right because you're too busy already stuffing your face. I'm sure it's different when you're there in person, but no matter how many obstacles they throw my way to make it seem like they don't want my business at all, I still keep vying for their attention like some crazy pre-teen Justin Bieber fan.

I went on a Saturday afternoon. I usually get food for my co-workers and we've been curious to try this place out because it was a diamond in the otherwise rough Indian School Rd. area. I got to the drive-thru at 2:30, thinking that it would be quicker than going in.  I had to be at work at 3, so no problem. Boy, was I so wrong.  As I arrived at the speaker-box, the employee immediately told me to hang on a moment as he was busy with the current customer at the window. No problem: new store, new employees, new things to learn, I understand.   Then ... silence. 5 minutes later, still no response. Cars were starting to pile up behind me so I finally asked if I could order and this is the reply, 'Oh ... yeah, I forgot you were there.'  Cool brah, my self-esteem thanks you.   I ordered a dulche de leche shake, the short rib and chicken tacos, and the burger with fries. When I rolled up to the window, the younger man working the register tells me to wait, again, as the card machine wasn't working and my food would take a little bit. Understatement of the year.  It's 2:55 now and I'm wondering if they're plucking the chicken feathers and scraping the meat off of bones back there because that's the only excuse for having to wait so long. When they finally work things out and hand me my food,  I end up late to work, hastily give out the food to my co-workers, and sneakily eat my own burger behind the counter.   Basically: I don't see the difference in buying a burger from here or 5 Guys even though they say it's made with different ingredients. Both are the same high prices (when you take toppings into account), same patty size, don't come with fries, and they both have excessive juice/oil dripping down my hand. Fries taste exactly like the salt and pepper Boulder Canyon chips except they went a little heavy with the black pepper, and when I asked my co-workers if they enjoyed the tacos, they told me next time to save my money and go to Tacos Sahuayo nearby for something tastier and cheaper.   The only thing i can compliment them on is the dulche de leche shake, but anything else is just alright, nothing special. I hate it when everyone else has a good experience and I'm the odd one out :[

If you're looking for furniture to fill your Cophenhagen themed decor that should not be touched by  pets, human beings under 4'11", or anyone that might cause a slight wrinkle in your expensive leather, this is obviously not where you should be looking.   If you're looking for a more realistic couch that's meant to be used quite often, durable, and extra comfy in case you get kicked out of the bed more nights than most, then you should definitely start here.  I spent a day looking for the right sofa, no joke. I went from Indian Bend (Jack's Warehouse, American Furniture) to Chandler (Ikea, My Pigsty, World Market).  My mileage looked like I had gone to LA by the time I was done. After you go to a couple of places, you start seeing the same material, styles, and even the very same couches no matter how many times you blink and you're left to only decide depending on the store's prices/sales.   I hate being bombarded by salespeople who start ranting unlimited color options for a couch I barely sat on or eyed for three seconds, but I admit it's not enough to deter me from buying anything. Pruitt's employees gives off the feeling that they're not paid by commission, and even if they were, I couldn't tell. They tell you what you want to hear, no gimmicks or fluff, and if you don't like it, they leave you in peace until you feel like talking to them again.  Needless to say though, the pricing didn't add up at most of these stores and I ended up going to Pruitts and within 20 quick minutes, found a fabulous couch, $279 with free delivery, softer than floating cloud wrapped in a warm flour tortilla placed on a baby's butt.   Yeah, it's that comfy.

So, I graduated with a double major and 2 months later, I was still unemployed as fate would have it. Thus, instead of wallowing in ice cream and Netflix, I decided to gorge my sorrows down at all the pizzerias in Arcadia after every failed interview like a true champ during this slow period of agony.  I still have to write reviews for the other places, but Nook is definitely freshest in my mind. This review speaks mostly to the prosciutto and meat lovers. If you happen to be a gluten-free, veggie lover, you and your cult can stop reading as of right now. Most other pizza places only give you the smaller option of like a 7" pizza, but here at Nook, their standard is a lot bigger and honestly you could split between two and not break the bank. Not a single space on the pizza is left empty, even if you only ordered just one simple topping because their fresh-pulled mozzarella is like an entirely new topping, with certain areas with bigger chunks of cheese than other areas. Only thing that kind of irked me was that I asked to add spinach and instead of sprinkling it throughout the crust and baking it, they just put a bunch of raw spinach in the middle which isn't exactly what I was expecting.   It seriously was like my eyes were deceiving me. There was so much prosciutto on my pizza that I can only compare it as if you were unfolding an onion. Layer after layer, it was never ending, like it was saying "Don't worry Loretta, we'll always be here for you." So reassuring and gratifying, just like the guy's voice from those Allstate commercials.   We also had the Pork Butt appetizer and those were right on par as well, not too much sauce to just overwhelm the taste buds and just a little coleslaw for some coolness and tang.   Great place for a date and service is very friendly and flexible with options. Great place that takes the extra time to concentrate on careful portions.

I've been a longtime customer of Doc's since he opened up shop and if you're wanting to support a great local business, this should definitely be in your Top 5.   Step away from the processed ice cream bars, cleanse your palette, and head over here to enjoy the purest forms of flavor in a much needed natural chilly popsicle. Doc has some flavors that can be daunting like Coconut Lemongrass Lime or Peanut Butter and Jelly, but don't let that scare you. You're spoiling your tongue and its' fledgling flavor buds so stop being a selfish jerk just because you have fears that stray from your normal unhealthy ice cream habits. His flavors change according to the seasons and I can't tell you just how much I cry internally that I have to wait until Fall for my beloved Concord Grape. My second favorite is Strawberry Champagne which has this unusual little fizz when it melts - but that's just the way I like my drinks so bottoms up and tongue out!  If you have the extra time, Doc is more than happy to tell you how he decided to get into the ice cream industry which is a pretty bizarre story itself. It takes 7 or so years of school to make ice cream, kiddos. Who knew you had to slave away at the same pace as an architecture major?  Only con is that I can't get them to my family on the west side since they melt pretty easily and just texturally aren't the same even when I try to keep them in an ice box. Thus, no one believes me when I describe these holy grails but I just wrote a Yelp review on it so I hope that will suffice their ignorant/sheltered minds.   From a business catering standpoint, Doc charges extremely less than Paletas Betty - like almost 50% less to feed over 100 people. So why not satisfy your stomach at the same time while everyone else hails you the Under-Budget King/Queen of the office?

Not going to lie, I did not trust this place one bit because come on - the place used to be a sex toy/clothing shop. In my mind, I just couldn't see how the place could be built for dog boarding but, Mirna (owner) proved me wrong.  Central Phoenix was seriously lacking a dog boarding center despite how dog-friendly the Biltmore/Arcadia businesses are and how apartment ridden this area is. I was going on vacation but moved from the 24/7 Gilbert Dogs area and needed to find somewhere closer than having to basically trek to Mexico just so my dog could be boarded.  This place was literally steps nearby and once again, I was wary due to the former business it used to be and how new it was with not many reviews. I first went to take a look at the the place and Mirna more than willingly gave me a tour. No dildos or bras surprisingly, but an actual agility/play area with more than 4 sections to move dogs around. 40 bucks a night is more expensive than most other places but if you look at their Facebook page, you'll see why.  My beast of a dog isn't exactly dog friendly after being attacked and finds other dogs annoying. I don't know where she got that from, definitely not me *eyes shifting*. It was my first time boarding and I nicely warned the staff that if they didn't update at least twice a day with pictures or videos of my beast breathing, I would assume that my dog was dead like Green Acres and start a one woman Ferguson Riot of my own. Mirna and the staff made sure she always had one on one enrichment and training and made sure to constantly upload the Facebook so I could breathe a little easier while I was away.   What was probably the best part? My dog didn't come back home smelling like she came from the mighty St. River of Dog Pee. I used to hate that I had to give my beast a bath after Gilbert Dogs because she smelled worse than a skunk but she smelled so great I almost cried tears of joy as I smuggled my face into her fat rolls.   Definitely give it a try! They also offer Veterans discounts so yay!
