This place is great! We found it on Yelp and are so glad we chose this over one of the over-priced, crazy busy chains on the strip! The lobster omelet and the Jesephine omelet were great! I also tried a piece of the smoked salmon and as a former Oregonian, I was shocked that I really liked it!! It's been here for years and the decor is nothing special, but don't be fooled by that! I also had one of the best cuppucinos I've had in a long time. The waiter was super friendly and we chatted with a very friendly local, which was a lot of fun. Don't miss this place!

I decided to go a little off the freeway to get a better deal on gas, as I was passing through the Phoenix area.. So I saw this place and decided to fill up here. When I finished pumping the gas, I was asked if I wanted to purchase a car wash so I did. I then took my receipt around the back to where the car wash was and found out it was closed! I have NO idea why they would sell me a car wash if the car wash was closed, but I thought it must've been a mistake and it was no big deal; I would just go inside and get a refund.. WELL, it wasn't so simple! The cashier wanted to argue with me and lecture me about how I should've looked at the hours before I accepted the car wash! Then she proceeded to tell me that she couldn't give me a refund because I "shouldn't have said yes if I didn't really want it". I explained to her again that I DID  want it but I didn't know they were closed.. Anyway, I refused to give up (all this over a few bucks-but matter of principle at this point). Anyway, it definitely wasn't worth the extra mile to get the cheaper gas!!
