Love this place, great food and atmosphere can always rely on them for a nice time.  Love the Nachos to share and a couple drinks is a nice after Theater snack LOL

Wow very disappointed again, other times were nominal but they are sloppy and not thorough.  Also if you want your trunk vacuumed it is up to you to tell them or they won't do it.  I got the works and expected it but guess I need to find out every policy they have prior to having the car cleaned.  They advised me the policy is not to get into personal space, i.e. the trunk, unless it is requested.  I had the works and the floor mats cleaned which totalled over $30, don't bother with any upgrades from them it's not even worth $9.  I live around the corner so they are convenient but I'll travel to get somewhere that does a better job for less money.  This isn't the first time I've had to go back and won't do it this time, just won't go back again.  Shame on me!   Good luck and hope it works for you but better ask about policies what they will and won't do and check it before you leave.. my bad.
