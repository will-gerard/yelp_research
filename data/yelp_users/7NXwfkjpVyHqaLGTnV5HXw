This is my favorite Chinese Joint in Az.  The owner Margeritta is very polite.  They have a Huge menu.  and the best part is everything is REAL!  Nice atmosphere for a nice family dinner, quick lunch, or a date.  This is the best joint and beats out all of the other places at the Chinese Cultural Center by far.  If you haven't gone here do it.

This is our family's secret joint for Chinese food. Never had anything there I didn't like. Also great pricing. Gotta try their HUGE Dumplings! If u r a person who like "real" Chinese food  or your American "chi chi" Chinese food (sweet n sour, orange chicken, etc) you will leave satisfied.

Some of the things on the menu are strange... But I've liked everything I ordered both times I've been.  Adventurous and boring (like myself) italian food lovers alike will find something they will enjoy.  The waitresses are hot so thats a plus too haha.  And one more thing PIZZA COOKIE.

I come here a lot for lunch.  All of the food is very good.  They have both authentic and american type Chinese food (sweet n sour, orange chicken, etc).  Plus the price is AMAZING!  I've turned a lot of my co-workers onto this place.  If you are in the Mesa/Tempe area and want some good Chinese that's cheap you can't beat this joint.

Ok guys... So a group of friends and I went to This park last night to celebrate.  We bought the tickets that would allow us to go into two different houses.  We were right at the end of the first house walking through a dark tunnel with uneven ground.  My friend was holding onto the wall to steady himself and snagged his hand on a nail.  An employee taped up his gashed

The Best Chinese food Buffet I've had.  Yeah Its a buffet so some of the items aren't super fresh. But they have amazing selections.  I come here with my team often after we compete and they are very accomodating.  The same people that own this own Lao Ching Hing at the Chinese Cultrual Center.  Legit Chinese food uffet style. How can you beat that? Plus if you come after 9 you get to fill a togo box for $5 or something. pretty cool if you ask me.

These guys saved my life! my Macbook Pro died on me the day before my midterm! They were able to fix my laptop and save all the data in 45 minutes for under $100! Even the Mac store couldn't do that! I'm gonna use them anytime I have mac problems in the future and you should too.
