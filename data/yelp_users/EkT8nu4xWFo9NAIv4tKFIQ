This place is amazing and I would recommend them to anyone. My husband bought me Valentines flowers and there was a little mishap but the hoops that the owner and manager jumped through to fix the small issue showed their remarkable customer service. The manager himself took everything into his own hands and made sure everything was perfect and even did the delivery himself which says a lot. The flowers were beautiful and everything was so perfect

Fun place, friendly people as well. Great service, we weren't sure we would make it by the time they stopped serving dinner so we called, the guy on the phone let us put in an order so we wouldn't miss out. I like that kind of friendly service

I have always loved coming here. They recently changes their food menu and it's a great selection of Irish favorites.

Very disappointing. I called this company because my drip system was acting up in my front yard. The man came out and looked around for a few minutes and told us we needed to replace the whole motor which was going to cost us over $680.00. Boy am I glad that we didnt move forward right away with his services. Today our landscaper came out to trim up our yard and took a quick look at the system and found that the sensors were dirty!! THATS IT, dirty sensors!! He charged us $35 to fix it right up. Beware that it seems if you are clueless as to what is going on they will attempt to take advantage

I love this place, they always do a great job on my car and never leave me disappointed. You can never be too picky as they're always so busy. But, I must say I've always had perfect friendly service

I gave one star because I had to.  This was one of the worst experiences ever!! We ordered food which was almost a hour late. Then the order was wrong. Courtney the young lady who answered the phone told us that there is no way to prove we ordered it a different way. Not very good customer service if you ask me. Oh! And the manager was busy and refused to come to the phone to try and help. I am extremely offended at the fact they basically called me a liar and said that we ordered our food wrong that they didn't get it wrong. Very rude, unfriendly service. Beware before you order delivery here. I will make sure to tell everyone I know to not go here.

I wish I could choose no stars. Originally a happy customer I had taken my ring in to be fixed for the 3rd time in just over a year. I decided I want to upgrade my center diamond and tried asking the lady I believe her name is Chris, that I would like to make sure they have the kind and quality I am looking for before bringing in my husband in a few days on his day off. She told me that when I bring my husband in we will look! Wow!! I tried to explain he will not come in and drive all the way there if they do not have what we want and she said "we will have it" completely rude and horrible customer service. I could easily cut the check just like my husband could but we make decisions together ultimately mine being the last one cause it's for my ring. My decision is to never do business here again and that's too bad cause we have spent a lot of money here. I work in sales and if I ever told someone's spouse we will wait till your husband is here, I would be out of a job. Stay away from this place

Super annoyed, I received a flyer from this joint talking about a grand opening and such so we decided to try it out. We drove out of our way to give a new restaurant some business. Thier flyer said "grand opening" open daily till 10pm. We showed up at 9 and they rudely turned us away saying they were closed and they haven't had a customer for an hour so goodbye. Probably won't be in business too long with that kind of service.

I was contacted by Christina Olson the General Manager today. She invited us in for a complimentary dinner and took great care of us. I am so happy that we were able to eat here, the food is amazing and the staff that was working was amazing as well.. Definitely try the Tuscan Risotto. For sure we will be back. Thank you for turning this into an amazing experience, can't wait to have dinner here again

These guys are amazing! I recently hit my after market rim on a curb (husbands car :/ ) and needed a repair quickly on our Pathfinder! They got me in and out in an hour! The work they did was great and professional and you can't even tell where the scratches were! I recommend this business to anyone. They're also affordable and I really appreciated the fact that they did not take advantage of me being female. The price they charged was very fair. Nice family owned company.

I recommend the Cajun shrimp and the pulled pork. They offer two kinds of bbq sauce for people with a sweet side or someone who may prefer savory. Friendly, inviting staff as well

So yummy, all I want to know is how come I have never been to this place before. The food is excellent, you need to be patient though as they're extremely busy and a little disorganized but the prize at the end of the line makes it worth it
