Absolutely LOVE this bar! The ambiance is beautiful - I love the long walk down the stone steps (careful ladies in high heels), the fireplace and comfy seating. My only complaint is that it is REALLY small - not the place to go with a large group.  The bartenders are phenomenal as is the food. Check it out for a romantic date night - you won't be disappointed.

I was there with the same group as Chrystalle B (below).  The food was great, but that was it.  Service was slow and the bill was a complete joke.  There weren't prices on all the items on the menu, so 12 people trying to look at a calculator tape and try to figure out what roll was what price? Not a good time.  We won't be back!

I literally have nothing good I can say about this place. We tried a similar place in Vegas and it was amazing, so when we found out that there was a place in Scottsdale that had private karaoke rooms, we were all in! HUGE disappointment! First of all, There are only two private rooms. One small, one large. And they weren't worth the $$$. They also charge you for a full hour. So we were there for 1.5 hours, but were charged for 2. It cost us double what we spent in Vegas for half the time. Then room itself was dark and plain. The karaoke system sucked. It kept telling us certain songs that were in the catalogue weren't available. The song selection was weak. And the lyrics kept fading out so you couldn't see them. The food was awful. Chicken tempura with no flavor. Seared ahi sliders that tasted like rubber. Drinks were poor. Service was horrible (waited 22 minutes for a soda!)...then the waitress kept walking in and interrupting songs. Then when we got our bill, an automatic 20% gratuity had been added! And the gratuity included the charge for the room fee! There's no way I would have given a $35 tip, but we had no choice. It was just bad. Will NOT be returning!!!

Found this seamstress on Yelp and since she wasn't too far from my house and had such great reviews, I decided to give her a try.  I am SO glad I did!!  Valentina has done everything from shorten a dress, take in some pants, repair a rip, re-line a dress, etc. for me.  Her prices are incredible, her turn around time is great (a few times she has worked hard to get me something I needed repaired right away), and she is extremely friendly.  I won't trust my repairs to anyone else!

I'm usually here for breakfast every Sunday. The food is fantastic (try the protein pancakes packed with blueberries and granola), the service is quick and friendly, and the owner is always there making sure his customers are happy. Not the fanciest place, but the food more than makes up for it.   Great prices, and great food.

Seriously the best burgers in town! I wanted to lick my plate clean. Tater tots and onion rings are cooked to perfection.  Ask for Andrew. He is knowledgeable, friendly, tells great stories and makes a great drink!

I've always been a big scaredy cat when it comes to going to the dentist.  So when I was told I needed some major dental surgery, I pretty much hit the roof.    I did a TON of research - spent about 6 months going to different oral surgeons and dentists.  each one gave me different options, but none of them listened to my fears and concerns...until I went to Dr. Chris Winterholler.  He truly listened to me and took my concerns and occupation (I'm an actor, so my smile and teeth are very important) into consideration when planning out my treatment.  I was informed on everything, every step of the way!    When it came time for my surgery, Dr. Winterholler took extra time to make sure everything was absolutely perfect and that I was happy with the final product.  His assistant Amy held my hand and talked me through the whole thing.  She made me feel safe and calm.  Dr. Winterholler even gave me his personal cell phone number (since my surgery was right before the weekend) in case I had any problems.  And one of the girls in the office went next door and bought me some soup to take home!  Everyone there makes you feel like family.  It's a great enviornment - I wouldn't trust my smile to anyone else.

We went here on a friend's recommendation for a birthday party.  So glad we did! Great food, drinks and atmosphere. Try their specialty tequila shots.  The pineapple tequila tasted like pineapple juice, but after 2, I was definitely feeling the tequila!  We had the fish tacos that were large and freshly made.  Can get a bit "college-y" later in the night and on weekends. If you like tacos and tequila, check it out for happy hour or dinner. Fun place!

Some of the best burgers I've ever had! All the food is awesome - as is the service. Definitely try the Brûlée burger and French toast fries. You won't be disappointed!
