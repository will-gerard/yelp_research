Chain restaurants are generally not my favorite.  Although,  after a night out with my family at this Tempe location...pleasantly surprised!  The interior decor has been modernized.  Dark wood and art work add to the atmosphere.  Host friendly, server efficient and the food very good!  We ordered the porterhouse,  sirloin and small ribeye. All medium,  and cooked to tender,  juicy perfection.  Again,  pleasantly surprised,  and I think you will be too!

This is my fourth year as a client, returning for every cut and color, satisfied and refreshed! The students are professional,  guided by on-site instructors and excellent products. You can't beat the price! Location is local, simple and easy to find. I'll continue to use the academy for all of my styling needs! (Also, my favorite added bonus is watching Adam instruct, very nice! Especially on the eyes! ;))

New location in Tempe,  recommended from memory of the previous establishment on Curry. I was ready for a wow experience.  The interior is clean, nice wood furniture,  although minimal decor.  Service was average,  not a high mark for hospitality. Menu prices are affordable,  although I feel the food lacks flare and flavor.  Overall, not much atmosphere,  server enthusiasm or exciting food. I would say it's a mid range Mexican food experience.  Try for yourself,  you're opinion may vary.

A trip back to Tempe, and I was looking for a place I remembered from before, Canteen.  It's now become El Hefe's.  They've done some renovating, and more patio space out front.  The staff is friendly, although, a little like Hooter's girls.  Service was very very slow, food was great, $2 tacos very good.  I would look around a little in the area before stopping here, but...give it a try and decide for yourself.

Basic breakfast, simple decor, service average,  food could be better. Service with a smile is nice, could be better overall.
