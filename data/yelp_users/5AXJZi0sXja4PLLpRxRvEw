The food here is decent. However,  the service  is so bad that I wouldn't consider ever going here again. The owner who was running the register definitely didn't make anyone feel welcome. (Not even a "Hello"?) Well, that and the fact that we ordered coffee and from the time we arrived until we left (nearly 40 minutes), all six containers of coffee were empty. The place was still busy. Surprise folks support small businesses in spite of how bad the customer service might be.

While I really miss the idea of being able to come whenever I wanted to, this gym really does have great hours. We have used the childcare on multiple occasions and the kids love it! I love being able to check in on them via the monitors. Just had a great smoothie. My son loves the rock wall and basketball court. Perhaps, I can get him to join me on the cardio and variety of equipment.

I really appreciate what Dwain did for us.  He was very friendly, got right to work, and was extremely detailed.  I was worried about pet stains which he promptly removed. His attention to detail was a breath of fresh air . .  especially on my couch.  I would highly reccommend Ames for your next carpet cleaning job.

Was just in California, and had to come back to the desert to get this great food. Choose as spicy as you want. Get corn Sausage, and other goodies in your bag. New Orleans style restaurant great food not on the cheap side though. great for that special event wait staff really friendly and helpful. Andy, our server was great!
