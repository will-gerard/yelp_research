Very friendly waitress, excellent bread excellent  choccimisu for dessert. The veal parmigiana for lunch was rather small and thin and could not cut it with a fork, had to use knife and fork for every bite. Did i mention it was thin yes very thin. Side of pasta tasted OK. Grilled warm sliced mushroom salad was fine. I really was hoping for large portions like other reviewers said to take some home for lunch but it was not the case today.

Stopped for a cookie,  wound up with 2 scoops of gelato, 1/2 price at happy hour. Exotic flavors, but I chose the peanut butter chocolate chunk, chocolate chunk mint. Delish

Get to the stop two minutes before they are supposed to leave and the bus had already left and I did not see any tail lights of the back end as I got off the escalator  to catch the bus because I knew I was close and it was 443 pm not 445pm. this bus service in Phoenix sucks with their timeliness.

so i called to store our rv, talked to the toll free number, assured me it is 60 feet long and they take rv storage, also talked directly to the store manager via phone 2 times before arriving, again assured me no problem. well as arrived, he comes out and says it wont fit in here! so i have this 55 foot rig with no place to store it ! all the local places are full because it is time to store the rv for the season. finally found a place 120 miles away. NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH CUBESMART AGAIN,  also i will not renew in denver either for my storage unit. cost me so much time and diesel fuel to drive to you and then to drive 2 hour to another place. not to mention 2 hour drive to pick it up when i want to use it next time. #FRUSTRATEDCUSTOMER

Where else at the airport can you get a pepperoni mushroom pizza for about 975 plus tax it was quick and delicious and the staff was very friendly and currently they still honor Fox restaurant concept gift cards even though Fox sold this chain off

Great chips and salsa, free, and the bowl of chicken soup was the best. Great kick to it and loaded with shredded chicken, I mean loaded. It was a meal.

Fucked over on first ride free. Credit card charged $13.88 anyway. Fuck Lyft. If it sounds too good to be true it probably is

What a great little gem i found by accident today. Great single serving desserts you don't have to buy a big bakery item that serves five to ten people, most everything I see is individual serving,  that you could have one of everything or just one to take with you. Smells amazing, friendly cashier too.

Had the key lime donut $3. Amazing. Better than voodoo in Denver. Also had the chicken single piece breast. Great fried chicken on bone. $4.50 Crispy....served with a side of Korean chili sauce. Which I tried on side but did not like it. But that's cuz I am not a fan of Korean foods. Definitely will be back for donuts. PS decided on apple fritter to go. $2
