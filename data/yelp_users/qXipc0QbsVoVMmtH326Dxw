Should have come here first - Went there about a year ago did not like the feel - so walked away and decided to keep the current car. I really wasn't in the market - but got a call from Barry - with the hours I work I don't return calls during the week so called back - he had no clue who I was and I should have ended it there. He claimed he could make it work blah blah blah - what was I looking for blah blah blah - did not listen to a thing I said except Sunroof - that was all the car had. He called me back needed me to do a credit app - they need to see the current car - blah blah blah - I was at Sprouts down the road so I went in. Huge mistake monster.....he took a credit app the assessed my trade in and he pointed to a car he had selected for me - I have not driven didn't even know if I liked it. He starts doing the salesman dance and 1/2 of the way in it I start asking to drive the car - now remember I was in there in March of 2011 so I have NOT driven the 2012 - and I was looking at a Beetle. They dig it out and I am allowed to take it up the 51 on sunday with no traffic and back....nothing remarkable - but I asked him questions about the car - did it have cruise control - no he said but it did - I finally got a brochure so I could see what I was getting into on paper and then waited and waited and waited and waited - the first game of the play offs was over....and I wated somemore.  At that point I see my license plate in Barry's hands so I became a little nervous finally I am taken into Antoinne's office - they are giving me this for free that for free - the conversation is tapped....the whole time I am saying that I know no bank is open today but he tells me they are a VW dealership and write their own deals....yea his mouth was moving so we all know he was lying....he would not put me in a 20k vehichle if he did not KNOW that this deal was done....more horse manure.....then the fun really begins. I leave the lot get into traffic and this car will not move. I took it over by my office to a vacant street and I can not get it up over 45 mph - it is a dog! Monday morning I call them and tell them this car isn't going to work....they tell me no worries we will get you approved and then swapp the car. Monday afternoon I get a call from Barry he wants to make an appointment - I can not commit to a time due to my job so tell him sometime between 630p - 800p - Tuesday I go in and guess what - no the deal is not done - but hey I can test drive the other cars - hey isn't that what you are supposed to do before you try financing - don't you test drive first?? So I leave again wasted my time...but here is where it gets really funny - I get a voicemaill from their ' Customer Service Manager' calling to congratulate me for my new cark - so the next day  I call her back ...now they have had this deal since Sunday   but she says after laughing at all of this because apparently poor customer service is funny to the Customer Service manager - that they have only had the deal for 2 days - umm no you have had it for 4 days. I agree to give them 2 more letting her know that either I have an answer on Thursday  because I am going out of town. In the mean time I sit down with a friend in on the lending side and he begins to tell me the reason it is taking so long is no bank will pick it up because  they are over charging me on the car -  extended warranty -  gap insurance - Zak treatments - everything  and that my current car is retailing for 19k - they offered me 13k ...so we  construct an email restructuring the deal and letting them know I will not come in until they have a letter of credit from the bank. 2 more days no calls so I call no word so- 2 hours later after waiting to find out it is ready I showed up. After telling them I was NOT going out of town with a car I don't own I get the Jeep - but they have lost my License plate - in fact if I had not walked the vehicle I would have left with out any plate,  lost my spare key and to top it off there is 300 miles added to the car but hey they did a crappy cleaning job... I get in the car and bam smack in the front window  - a chip good thing I have insurance let Farmers deal with them! The email is sent Thursday night  and I wait for the call from the tool Barry nothing all weekendMonday I call and he lies and says he called me hmm funny notthing on my cell from him....He calls back magically my key has appeared so I let them know I will be in afterwork..show up and the receptionist greedily takes my plate but pretends she does not know where mine is - funny she finds it in the drawer and tells me I have to sign for it. Excuse me - it is my license plate and my key - I am not signing for anything She then abruptly told me she was not releasing my plate to me - I reached over grabbed the dealer plate back  and stepped  out to call the police as I was not going to deal with their garbage.  The police showed up and handled it and I left - NEVER TO RETURN

After a melanoma diagnosis, 2 surgeries, 3 weeks of chemotherapy resulting in bronchitis and a thyroid that is a hot mess I came to Inner Vision. Things have turned around partially on the health front but the residuals of the wide excision continue to confound the teachers on how to modify back poses so I am not in excruciating pain. I am trying to schedule some individual training time to see if I can get this resolved

Went in on 12/23 to shop for foundation from Clinique - was high jacked by Smashbox - spent 224.13 sadly while processing it the system showed it failed so they ran it again as a credit card - ultimately charging me twices for the same purchase. Nordstroms denied processing it twice yet - there it was...my bank finally removed the charge only to have Nordstroms push the charge through 5 days later - AGAIN. I knew this had to be an issue so took it to another level the regional manager - what a waste of time - she can not call me back and sends the Manager at Nordstroms who denied all of this call me instead. Now I finally get a call back to inform me that this happened to SEVERAL people and now I am facing 5 NSF fees from my bank - because of them and they want me to give them ANOTHER 5 days to process this...

Went for months - I have baby fine wavy hair so no texturizing - apparently this is not something they understand as I left in July with a head full of texture - never went back.

Oh my gosh - the best Gluten free pizza ever I am in heaven!! I didn't think that I would survive this wheat allergy but now I have hope!!! The Pizza was crisp and chewy and amazing - I can't wait to try all of the flavors and they even told me that they would make one that was bruschetta - that was poetry to my wheat deprived mind!! Thank you so much!!

This review is for the pharmacy - I am a cancer patient about to begin chenotherapy  to make my life less complicated for this time my oncologist wrote a script for 90 days nothing was said when I picked up the script but when I got home it was from 30 days. No call to me nothing said to me no call to my doctor - when  I went back to find out why no calls were placed I was told that I should be glad that they got one month of my prescription that my insurance had only allowed for 1 month however when I asked if they had called the doctor they said we don't call the doctor so apparently when your doctor writes a script this pharmacy fills it however they see fit - in addition to this the entire time I was there the pharmacist stood in the middle of the pharmacy yelling this across at me. So CVS here is the facts had your pharmacist called the oncologist - the later would have called the insurance to get this approved and you would have pocketed a nice sum of money - in addition to that if this had been advised to me at pick up and I had been informed I could have at that time left the script at the pharmacy and gotten the 90 days approved but because your pharmacist behaved in such an unprofessional manner I not only will NEVER be back  I will be filling a complaint for his refusal to come to the window and discuss this professionally. Costco will now get my business.

Run run run the other way - years ago when a wonderful stylist resided at this salon I would go like clockwork every 8 weeks - but alas they ran him off with their less than stellar management. They offered a free cut when they didn't advise that he had left and when I arrived for my appointment that was when I was told - excuse they lost my number what you confirmed my appointment on my cell just fine. The stylist was only interested in selling me extensions so I left - my daughter was back in town so why bother... but occassionally I would go into the store and buy Aveda products. After moving I finally agreed to give them a try - I took in my Kindle with over 12 pictures of the Pixie hair cut I wanted - this stylist - Michael cut the sides so close that you could see the freckles on the side of my head yes he used clippers for a Pixie cut telling me that actually this was a modified mohawk - did I mention that my daugther is an Aveda trained hairdresser to bad she is living in Texas now?  Yea so I know a thing or two about a pixie cut but I have been so busy at work that I have not had time to call but today I  had a moment to call them 3 weeks afterwards - I was supposed to come in for an appointment in 3 weeks and that was not going to happen....so I called to do the polite thing - move my appointment. After what I had been through I didn't want the same stylist so I asked first for the manager and then for the name of the stylist who cut my hair - the caller claimed he could not find it later it turned out to be him but he lied.. I was told that the manager would call me - and Jennifer did call me back but with an attitude. She started the conversation by demanding why I didn't say something the day I left - well first of all NO ONE asked me....alot of their staff told me they thought it was great but I really had not even seen it ..yes thats right while in the chair he turned the chair away from the mirror and upon completion did not provide me the normal 360 view in the mirror with a hand mirror. So until I got home I did not realize the damage that had been done - and it was BAD the sides are a little over 1/2 an inch. And all I got was attitude funny thing when I gave it back to Jennifer and said it exactly as she said it she did not like it. I wasn't mad it is hair it will grow out, I will hate it for the next 2 months but do not talk to me like it is MY FAULT...Your stylist chose to use clippers on me ....and on I did say something to him at that point but he told oh this is a really long guard...um NOPE... Seriously they do a crappy job here and if you complain you get attacked And for the record I am happy to pay for my hair cuts but I want them done right the first time...you have no excuse if I show you a dozen photos ... Perry Monge here I come and I will definitely letting Aveda know as well..  *Update* I didn't get the owners phone number I was given his email and the owner either works for or owns a car dealership....shocker...this explains why their customer service is horrific as other have reported  STAY AWAY

Sent over my USAA request for a C-Max and Chapman replied I won't walk into their dealership unless a deal is done as 2 ugly previous dealings with these tools has made me very distrustful. They kept saying they could do it but they didn't have my credit... They said they had the deal but when I asked what bank when no applications had been submitted... Then they had my deal but ask them how much at what interest and what payment  and 2 days of phone tag asking for the details in writing I was told $730 monthly so did the math and realized they gave me $5000 on a car that KBB says is worth $12000 and my USAA discount gone... 28k car had been financed at 38k. Liars and scammers work here hell will freeze over before I deal with them and yes I am keeping my car **update ** I got an email from Sales Director Marlo Watkins apologizing for the games but he just could not send me the deal in writing because I  would not understand it! This is after I gave him until Monday to get it to me all I can say is WOW!! Do you think he gets just how offensive he is or are these tools really that ignorant? **** Response to the GM ***  Dear Sir  I did provide your office with all of the details and your team sent inquiries to 7 banks the problem is you are a group of rip off artist who the Internet has killed. You misrepresented my credit claiming there were dings that were not there to justify 12% interest. I bought a car at 3.25% with nothing down so i know you lied. Have a nice life!!

Worst experience - credit card charged with out permission, massage was horrible cancelled membership and won't go back.  I love it when the staff responds ...so let me clarify something for you Mike when I checked out I was told all iota was the tip and how did I want to pay for it. And to clarify you do not have permission to charge my card you have permission to charge me for services that I received that you submit a bill for I did not receive a bill I was not advised there was anything owed beyond the tip. Your customer service is horrible this comment that you posted to my review is proof of it and I have filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.

Marginal service my brows were always off balance with one too thin but the best part is when I moved to Flagstaff and had $90 in credit. First they claimed I didn't have an account when I phonetically spelled it the girl in the phone STILL could not find my account! I was annoyed this was in August finally after 3 attempts she found it. Fast forward to September no call regarding my refund and I call back same woman who lies  and says she called me...hmm cell phone shows nothing.. She wants my credit card over the phone claiming she did not have it - seriously have you heard of PCI compliance? No I will not give my credit card to an incompetent liar send me a check .. Can't do it has to check on an exception will call me back later yesterday but no call back again. No thank you I can do my own brows better for far less garbage.
