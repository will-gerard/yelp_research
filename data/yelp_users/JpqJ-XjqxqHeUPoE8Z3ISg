Their meatball & chicken parmesan heros are phenomenal. $8 for a hearty sub that fills you very well is a great deal. A great New York style Italian deli in northern Phoenix makes me feel like I'm back on Long Island, can't miss.

Place was horrible. Server dropped a drink all over the table & then when we asked if he was new he said he wasn't, but then we found out that he is. When we got our food everything besides the plates was barley room temperature. Manager said he would get us all new meals, but the server had to re-take the order because he forgot the original order we had. He came again & the food was STILL cold. We left & the manager said that "there's no way the waffles are cold because we just pulled them off the waffle iron." If that is the case, they should check to make sure their waffle iron is functioning right. My father was able to grab & hold the "freshly cooked" waffle in his hand. If it was fresh from the iron, he shouldn't be able to without burning his hand.  We went with my parents, my brother & my son to be mother-in-law for my fianc√©'s birthday breakfast & it was not a good way to start her day. I worked in the restaurant business for 4 years & my father is a cook at a restaurant, that is not how you handle business & Customer Service 101 days never lie to a customer. This restaurant should be closed.
