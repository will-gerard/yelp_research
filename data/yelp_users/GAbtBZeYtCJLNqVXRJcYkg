Oh Pane, you stole my heart. Not only was your service spectacular, your staff was nice, attentive and prompt. We had about 15-20 people come in at 2:45pm unknowing that you were closing at 3pm for a reserved event. You served all of us promptly without one mess up on an order. The food was ridiculously great and the water/drinks were always being filled or asked if another beer would be liked. I ordered the mozzarella sandwich which came on a warm focaccia bread... it was such a nice touch. The mozzarella was fresh and ample. The basil was fresh without any dents, blackening on corner leaves or bruising from being ripped/chopped- any of the such that often arrives on such sandwiches.   The d√©cor is very anthropologie bohemian chic... so cozy. I can't wait to frequent you again next time I'm in phx. You lived up to all the raving reviews friends have told me.

We ordered about 4 sushi rolls as appetizers -- they were all amazing. I ordered the thai noodle salad which was incredible also. Our service was top notch. This place is a definite after-work favorite easily. I can't wait to try more things on the menu.

I find myself craving impeccable smooth coffee similar to Intelligentsia, Toby's Estate, Stumptown, Counter Culture, Blue Bottle, [insert  more brands to reinforce coffee snob elitism]... the whole artisan coffee scene that lacks in Arizona overall. I think Lux is the answer for Phoenix's market for  coffee connoisseurship and boutique roasting.   Lux is industrial chic. Vintage industrial with soft touches of retro typewriters on tables. Its a muted scream of modernism without trying to hard. It's so effortlessly cool, clean, simple. The front side of the building facing East is all brick and hard to tell that there's even an awesome business running, let alone of what nature. Seems almost as if you have to be in the "know" to find it and hear about it.   Everywhere are cute hipster boys and girls which makes me fall in love and turn into a total creep peering and drooling not so secretly. The bar is a nice touch that was much needed and I'm glad they've now incorporated that into the place.   Coffee comes at the perfect temperature- not too hot where beans burn and leave a bitter sharp lingering muddle. The latte art is cool and a nice touch. You can get your coffe as a drip, chemex, French press.  Not sure about hario pour over or aeropress although I think they do have that option (unless I'm mistaken for a diff coffee shop in Phx area that offers that too)  Quality coffee is definitely prevalent. They roast their own coffee so you know it's fresh. The foam is always light and fluffy and not filled with too dense bubbles. Definitely lickable. They offer almond milk which is so refreshing as an alternative to soy.   The music can get loud sometimes so I tend to venture into the back patio. I haven't tried Lux's food but I'm sure it is up there, and if not, Pane Bianco right is next door.  My only one complaint (which I could care less about also) is that the line is a little akward when it gets backed up into the entrance but sometimes runs also into the middle of the room.

This place is the cutest date place. The patio is fun and romantic with cute lights and grape leaves growing around. The burrata salad is a must have. We ordered 2 pizzas- one margharita and one white pizza. Both were so tasty but we leaned towards the margharita as the winner. The italian wine we ordered was a hit and tasty as well. Our waitress recommended it and I wish I had remembered what kind it was. Seems that the staff sure know their stuff!   Beware of mosquitos on the patio though!

I dont think the price is worth the food. I asked for my gorgonzola steak medium rare and got it bloody red rare. I would have asked them to take it back and cook it some more but the gorgonzola cheese would be an absolute disaster for that. Others complained about their steak.  I would rather cook myself or go to outback... or any other high end steakhouse in the same price range.

I cannot even begin to explain how great this place is. Thai food is my favorite and I've had it home cooked by Thai natives as well as in amazing SF restaurants. This place is up there! There were 4 of us so we ordered 3 dishes to split- red curry, pad thai, pad kee mao. Each one was sooooo finger licking good. Their thai iced tea wasn't watered down one bit and wasn't overloaded with ice either. Nothing is skimpy about this place. We had tons of leftovers left. I will make this a definite stop when in the area!

Coffee quality here is great. Boyfriend ordered a chai latte and I ordered a regular latte. I dont normally like chai's but this one was the best I've tasted. It wasn't too sweet or overly nutmeg'd out. The cookie accompaniments are a nice touch. My one gripe is that the ambiance is a little odd. It was packed but dead quiet. I felt as if I was imposing if I engaged in much convo with my bf. It's almost library-esque.

While I'm a fan of the cakes, the staff is RUDE. There were two staff members in the room that greeted us, then went in the back and didn't come out for about 10 minutes. Then when I ordered, they were speaking to myself and coworkers as if we had invaded their time. They also wouldn't let us use our coupons although they weren't expired and were completely valid based on terms and what we wanted (buy 1, get 1 on small bundts).

Great donuts as any Krispy Kreme lover knows, but the service here at 7:30am was top of the line and perfect! Super friendly and fast.
