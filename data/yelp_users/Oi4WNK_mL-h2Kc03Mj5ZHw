Been using this company for years for all of our custom uniform needs. We run a commercial service company providing janitorial and maintenance services to buildings all over the US and all of our uniform orders come out of this location. They are always on time and have very competitive rates. I would recommend this company to anyone.  Blue collar also has provided me with all of my own non-uniform industrial clothing. They always have a very good selection in their store and have the ability to order anything I desire.

Really enjoyed working with these guys, fun to talk to, very knowledgeable, patient and friendly.   They have a great selection with lots of variety and great prices. I couldn't find better prices locally for bullion and they were able to put my order together for me quickly without hassle.   I'll be back!

As far as teppanyaki restaurants go this one isn't top of my favorites. 2 stars for good service and a nice setting... I'm docking 3 stars for my food being over cooked and not being offered anything to replace it, and our chef not doing any sort of classic teppanyaki cooking tricks (making oil light on fire, flipping shrip at people, bouncing his utensils around.. ect). Decent place to eat, but not a value for what you pay for.

Always have enjoyed eating at Chili's but this location was not up to par. Ordered pick up for the margarita grilled chicken and when I returned to my office to eat it was surprised to find only 1/2 the regular portion in the box. -3 stars for value in my book. Will not be ordering pick up from here again.

It takes an astounding restaurant to motivate me to login online to leave a review. This one definitely deserved it.  I've tried several Pho restaurants in the Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale area and this is the best one I've tried.   The Food is amazing, the staff is friendly, the location is always clean, the menu is not overpriced, the selection is great, and the food always comes out very fast. I always leave this restaurant impressed.   If your looking for a great pho experience this the best pick in town, no competition.

Epic happy hour menu 3-7pm, every day. Great environment, food is unique and delicious, staff is friendly and knowledgeable, the drink and wine menu is spectacular (ask their Sommelier for a wine recommendation) and if you need a recharge check the USB ports under the bar!  I'll be back!

Great spot. Worth every penny. I have a beard and it's always terrifying going someplace new. These guys know what they're doing. Nice atmosphere, very welcoming. A+

Place is amazing. I've had authentic Hawaiian food in Hawaii before and this place does it right! Spot on! I had the LocoMoco, it was delicious. I'll definitely be back to have it again. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu as well.  Staff and atmosphere were great. Really enjoyed this spot!
