I met up for coffee with a friend, @MsHerr, at a nearby Starbucks.  She asked why I didn't have her meet me at the Coffee Rush.  Since then, Coffee Rush has been a top priority to try.  And it does not disappoint.  This is a great place to go for fresh coffee, awesome atmosphere, and a patio with a view.  The free small doses of Internet is a nice added bonus, too.

I have been to Teakwoods many times.  I always get the wings because they are delicious and meaty and I really wish I had some right now.  They have to be the best in Chandler.  The atmosphere of the bar is a little different, as they seem to be going for a Texas Road House-style peanut eating place.  The peanuts are in huge buckets at the table, and you are encouraged to eat them and smash the shells on the floor.  I like peanuts and I love smashing things, and let's face it...being drunk is a blast, so when you combined all three and then add in some delicious chicken wings and hot servers, how can someone not recommend?

The mom-and-pop coffee shop (hey, that rhymes) Romancing the Bean is quietly located near Tempe Town Lake and specializes in baked croissant sandwiches, huge cookies and espresso.  To get the negatives out of the way first, the place is a PITA to find the first time, and the short term parking is expensive.  The coffee wasn't anything outstanding, but it wasn't bad either.  But the atmosphere is great, the shop itself is immaculate, the staff were all very nice and the cinnamon twist thing I ate was insanely delicious.  There is also free WiFi.  This is a great place if you are looking to try some place new a little ways off Mill.  I will be back for sure.  3.5 Stars is more accurate.

If you are a fan of good dive bars, look no further.  Doc and Eddy's is more than just a dive bar and pool hall.  It is full of atmosphere and diversity.  I was first introduced to Doc and Eddy's in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and was instantly a fan.  So, when I moved out to Phoenix, I was happy to see one.  It is the sterotypical pool hall, from look to smell, and sometimes that is exactly the type of place I am in the mood for.  And their food has just the right amount of grease.    To go along with the pool tables, there are a variety of video games and TVs.  Not to mention this is a great place to people watch.  It has a mix of Snotsdale, The Hills Have Eyes, Students and Middle aged people.  Fridays and Saturdays get pretty busy.

if you are in tempe, and want a quick and delicious lunch, ted's is the place to go.  ted's is a perfect place for a great brat on a toasted bun.  they have the art of cooking hot dogs and brats down to a science.  the line goes fast, too, so its always a good place to meet a friend at lunch.

I love Steve's.  Having been here twice now, I feel safe with my conclusion.  Steve's Espresso is tucked away on the side of an obscure strip mall in Tempe.  Most don't even know it is here, which is perfect for an increasingly anti-social nerd like myself.  The atmosphere is a little bit different, too.  While it is like most coffee shops, it is a bit simpler and the music is a bit different.  All of which add to my liking of this place.   Let's not forget the coffee.  While I can admit I may have had better coffee at other places, the espresso at Steve's is very delicious.  And for some reason, I have noticed their Mocha tends to give me a bit more motivation than most places.    I thank @bwilley for having a meeting with me here, because it is now a new fav.

Simply put, this is a perfect little independent and locally owned bookstore with a very pleasant and knowledgeable staff.  They have new and used books, and you'll find people getting comfortable and reading just about anywhere they can find a spot.  They have fair prices and most likely take used book donations.  I highly recommend.  If only I had more time to read.

Great place to watch an Iowa Hawkeye game!  There is a HUGE Iowa following in the Phoenix area that meetup regularly at the Sandbar on Saturdays during football time.  And it gets crazy!  They turn all of the TVs to the Iowa game.  Everyone is drunk by lunch because the games start at 9.    Drinks are pricy, and there is a high DB count in this place, but the scenery is nice.    Be careful about parking, though.

not only do they have great sandwiches, they have one of the greatest sandwiches ever to appear on a menu: grilled peanut butter and jelly.  bison witches (which, if you say it right, it sounds like buy sandwiches) is a great spot to meet friends for a casual lunch.  its right in the heart of downtown tempe off mill and is also a great spot to watch ASU football home games.  i believe the owners also own quinton's in iowa city, iowa. http://www.yelp.com/biz/quintons-bar-and-deli-iowa-city

Royal Coffee Bar is another one of the Phoenix area's independent coffee shops and it doesn't disappoint.  Located in a very obscure part of Downtown (across from the County Jail...not that I ever spent a night there for Jaywalking or anything...that was in Tempe), Royal Coffee is a great little place to get away from the mainstream scene to enjoy a great espresso.    From the instant I hit the oddly shaped entrance that surely would make Willy Wonka proud, I realized I was going to like Royal Coffee.  The barista looked as though she thoroughly enjoyed her job and took pride in the product she served.  The parking does suck,but the atmosphere inside and the quality of the coffee made up for it.    This was a great place for Phoenix OpenCoffee to meet, and I hope we return again.   I live in the East Valley, but Royal Coffee gave me another reason to make my way downtown more often.

Let me be clear:  Best Burger in Arizona!   Lenny's is a 50s style dinner that serves the most delicious burger in Phoenix that I have yet to experience. The counter and barstools perfect the theme of the place and allow for customers to watch the cooks prepare the burgers or dogs.  The fries are delicious, too.  And it is one of the cheapest places to eat in downtown Phoenix.  And often times, Lenny himself is there taking your order.  I HIGHLY recommend Lenny's to any burger lover.  It will not disappoint.  And they just recently doubled the size of the place!

Phase 54 is a pretty awesome place to go.  Located in the middle of an industrial area in Tempe, the hidden nature of the club helps add to its uniqueness and attraction.  Phase 54 started out as a recording studio. Then they opened up the lounge upstairs for entertaining their clients.  The recording studio is downstairs.  The main bar is outside and has a sweet patio. On the inside is a smaller bar and some couches to chill back on.  If you want a different upscale place to go to on a Friday or Saturday night, I highly recommend.

Typical Starbs...but the baristas always have smiles on their faces, so I like to go.  It is the closest coffee places to my house, so I go often for a quick triple espresso.  They spell my name right, too (one T), without me ever having to say anything to them.   This is right by Chipotle, Jamba Juice and Fatburger, off the 202.

This is the typical Jamba Juice, but I felt compelled to write a review because every time I am in here, they are always very nice.    This is a regular stop for me and will be for some time.

Outside of the food prices and the wandering hippies, this place is awesome and has a little bit of everything.  Their produce is tremendous and always fresh.  They have a great deli with a large variety of meats, vegetables and tofu, a hot food bar, a massive salad bar, a soup bar, a wine bar, a sushi bar, a great sandwich counter, great coffee, awesome desserts and a HUGE selection of wines and beers from across the world.  One thing I have yet to try, but that I know is awesome, is their meat and seafood counter, where you can select a piece of meat or seafood and watch them prepare it and cook it right in front of you using whatever spices you want.  All of this, on top of their very evident attempt to give customers helpful information on organic living.  They host a plethora of events, from wine tastings to book readings, all in an attempt to help get the community together for a common cause.  East Vally Friday Nights is a regular happening at this location, too.   Their customer service is top notch, too.  I go to this Whole Foods frequently, and every time they always go out of their way to help me if I need it or if I have any questions.  Oh, and did I mention they have free WiFi?

Apparently, I am in the minority with my opinion of this place.  While the coffee is good, it shouldn't take 20 minutes to process my order.  I don't care if they are personally flying to Columbia right after I order to hand pick the beans right before they make it...20 minutes is unacceptable.   And then when I place my order, I shouldn't be insulted by the guy making it.  Yes, I asked for non-fat milk.  I didn't ask you to put Ketchup in my drink, I asked for non-fat milk.  Don't treat me like I am mentally challenged.  I weigh 165lbs, do you really think I order non-fat because I am concerned with my weight?  No business should EVER ask a customer what the point of their order is the way this dude asked me.    I want to like this place, I do.  The atmosphere and location were great, and the hot tattooed blond sitting at the counter was fun to flirt with (I think she could tell the guy annoyed me).  So for this, I will give it another shot.  A lot of the people I know rave about this place.  Maybe I just hit it on an off day.  If I get the same attitude the next time, I might drop trough mid store.

I love Firehouse Subs.  Soooo delicious!  I'm a regular here because it's close by.  Even if I wasn't close, I'd still be a regular.  I haven't had a bad sub or bad service here yet (knock on wood).  Love the sub card they have, too.  I always enjoy it when a place rewards me for eating there on a regular basis.  They just added a touch screen fountain pop machine, too, which I thought was cool since I'm a computer nerd.  It's not the cheapest place on earth, but that's my only gripe.

Suite 301 might be my favorite bar in Tempe.  301 is a couch type lounge with a great outdoor patio located on Mill Ave above Hooters.  The lighting, music and decor give it an chill atmosphere and ambiance all its own, especially for Downtown Tempe.  Friday and Saturday nights start off slow, but kick it into high gear fast about 11:30 or so.       One major plus...this place is loaded with hot bartenders.  What?  I'm just sayin. Another plus is that drinks are reasonably priced.  The wait staff are usually attentive if you are lucky enough to get a couch.    There is a negative of getting up there.  The elevator shuts off at a certain time and the back stairs get to be like a subway ride during rush hour in Japan.  And let's not beat around the bush...some nights it can be DB central.    But, I recommend it if you are on Mill and want to chill in a lounge.

I needed a custom frame for some Hawkeye memorabilia I have.  Having never had any custom framework done, I had no idea what to expect.  The woman at FastFrame was as nice as could be, helped me with the process step by step, and actually helped me develop my idea into a much more fulfilling design.  Framing isn't cheap, but FastFrame is the best quality for the best price.  I even got a hand written thank you in the mail after my purchase.  That was a nice touch.  If you need any framing done, I highly recommend.

If I could travel back in time 30 minutes, I would just so I could punch myself in the face for opting to try this place.  For starters, this is NOT a coffee shop.  While they are trying to angel themselves as such, they fail in that attempt.  Their failure really isn't any surprise, as the coffee menu was very limited and the girl behind the counter clearly wasn't a barista.    I ordered a latte, for lack of my normal (seemingly generic) mocha being on the menu.  After 10 minutes, I finally got it only to have it taste like what I assume old engine oil tastes like.  They also fail at being a bakery.  I don't want to be too harsh, but if I wanted a Fry's croissant, I'd go to Fry's.  They have a very limited bakery selection with their display having little more than a few cookies.  I will give them credit that their prices are cheap.  I also give the girl behind the counter credit.  She was having to wear 4 hats at once.  She worked hard and was very nice.  And they do have a lot of space.  But I really can't see myself going back, which is sad because there aren't a lot of independent coffee shops in this part of Chandler.

After getting urged by some friends/coworkers to start dry cleaning my clothes (apparently they think I am incapable of working an iron...which...I am), I finally broke down and tried it.  And my very first encounter with a dry cleaner was Fresh Cleaners.    Fresh Cleaners is a relatively new dry cleaning place near Whole Foods in Chandler.  Since it is close to me, I thought it was a great place to start my dry cleaning experiences.  I was immediately impressed!  It is a family owned small business that prides itself on being very personal.    The owners are great and have made it a point to remember me and what I like.  They treat me like Hollywood royalty and I love every second.  My clothes are always perfect when I pick them up.  They have even tailored and stitched up some pants for me.  And it is fairly inexpensive, too.  I take 10+ dress shirts and a few pairs of pants every time, and it has never cost me more than $25 bucks.  I believe they give a discount if you bring your hangers back in.  This might be common at all dry cleaners, but it is a nice added touch that I appreciate.   I highly recommend this place if you live near it.    Their website needs some work, though.  I wonder if they might want this nerd to assist them.  I totally would for little more than a few free dry cleanings!

Judging by some of the reviews, maybe I went on good days because I've enjoyed my trips.  Good food and good service.    The last time I went, I sat at the bar for lunch on a Sunday, ordered an All~Star Burger with BBQ sauce and enjoyed some sports.  The bartender was nice and the food came quick, which was good because I was hungry (I inhaled the burger).  I'll be returning on a regular basis once football starts back up.

If I can say anything positive about this place, it has a great location and the employees are nice.  And they have a great little outdoor patio to eat in.   But...this place is nowhere near as delicious as Chipotle.  And they are so slow, even when its not a peak meal time.   The Qdoba on Central is better.  This location is still pretty new, so maybe they are still working out some of the kinks.

Jimmy's is a good "hidden" place to eat.  It isn't exactly hiding, there just isn't much near by except the community college, a few car dealerships and a Little Caesars.  The restaurant is very nice, the food is good, the wait staff is personable and rumor has it their Happy Hour is good.    Nothing too out of the ordinary, but a good place to try if in the area.  I'll be back.

Apparently I had a different experience here than Jason L.  But I suppose they had a few months to clean up their act.    I met up with a few friends, and S of N were having a two for one special on all menu pizzas.  We got two larges, and they were fantastic.  Yes, it was a tad greasy...but its New York pizza and that is how it is suppose to be.   We also got the BBQ wings, which were great.   My only negative is that it took a bit long.  But, with two-for-one pizza I imagine they were getting pretty slammed in the kitchen.  I will be back, even with the new Native NewYorker down the street opening soon.

This review will get right to the point.  I had some time to kill before an early morning meeting today, so I gave Lola a try.   Espresso = Awesome Service = Awesome Atmosphere & Music = Awesome  Everyone that stopped in while I was there all seemed very happy, which rubbed off on me.  I'll be back.

I tried Jason's Deli a few weeks ago on the recommendation of a friend.  The first time I went, the line was super long.   The line told me it was probably a good place to eat.  Since I hate lines, I skipped it and told myself to go back earlier the next day.   When I went back, I ordered a basic turkey sandwich.  One gripe was the amount of time it took to make the sandwich for how basic it was.  It was worth the wait, though, because when they brought it to me it was thick with turkey.  Bonus!    And I felt good knowing it was a healthy lunch.

Located in the heart of downtown Phoenix, The Daily Grind is an awesome coffee emporium all around.  This coffee shop is about as centrally located as they come.  It is right off the light rail route, not far from the ball parks, very near a lot of paid parking spots and right across the street from Duck and Decanter.  The Daily Grind won me over from their name.  The double play on words is simple and clever.  Then, being located in the heart of downtown is awesome, as it allows for a lot of foot traffic to observe, not to mention the skyscraper construction.  The space in this place is spectacular.  They offer plenty of small tables to sit down and plug-in at and the atmosphere is great.   The overwhelming red color inside makes you think for a split second you traveled into some time warp and landed back in 1980's Russia.  I knew I was going to especially like it when I saw they offered complimentary WiFi.  They definitely know how to win a nerd's heart!  I managed to find a perfect table next to a window right next to a plug in...I could see myself sitting here all day inhaling espresso and working on writing projects.  The good music (Dave Matthews is playing as I type this) isn't going to make me want to leave, either.  This was another selection for Phoenix #OpenCoffee, and I definitely plan on coming back.  They even have a coffee club car (buy 10, get one free).

My niece was in town, and was beggin me for ColdStone.  I didn't want to drive and remembered that Orange Leaf opened up recently across from where I live.  So I convinced her to take a walk to try it out.  It was an instant success for both of us!  And judging by the amount of people in the place, I am judging we aren't alone in that opinion.    Orange Leaf has lots of yogurt flavors, lots of toppings (even healthy toppings like strawberries and bananas) and is a a great place to go for a tasty treat.    Wow, that sounds cheesy...but it's true.

Luke's is fantastic!  I have eaten at several places like Luke's over the years, so I was happy to see this open up as I live nearby.  The decor is simple, but nice (great HD TV).  The workers were friendly and funny.  Most important, the food was great.  I will become a regular here, you can count on it.  Try the bratwurst...you won't be disappointed.
