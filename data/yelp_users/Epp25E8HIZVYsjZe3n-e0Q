Adam the sever in the poker room is terrible at his job. Loved poker but the lack of follow up by the server was ridiculous. Other people complained about him as well. Should not have to track down the server to pay the bill.

The finance department is full of thieves. They are shady and nerve follow up when you call. Tricked us into buying warranties we didn't know were in the contract.

Definitely witnessed under age serving of alcohol. Overrun with under 20 somethings ordering cheap tacos. Hostess seated her high school friends who showed up thirty minutes after us and we waited. Will never come here. Awful experience.

Awesome time! Good food great show. Thank you!! Will be coming back soon. Howard the owner was a righteous dude. Definitely made us feel at home and welcome.  And the loaded nachos are kick ass      #sidebiceps
