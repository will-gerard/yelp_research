Everything there is Way overpriced. My sandwich wasn't terrible, just ok. I could make better at home. Definately not worth $9!   I will give them credit for their coffee. It is amazing.

Hidden gem. The food is great - consistently! Classic, old-time atmosphere. Very family friendly. Love it!

I went to the new Postino in Gilbert this weekend and was so impressed I stopped in the Arcadia location since I was in the neighborhood.  Blown away once again...  I was actually reluctant bringing my 2 and 4 year old to a hipster wine bar but when we arrived, we were greeted warmly and they were very nice and welcoming to my kids. So I was immediately put at ease.  They have an awesome kids menu with food kids will eat but upscale - PB and J bruschetta or grilled cheese, both accompanied with grapes, apple slices and chips AND a cute little bendy toy - nailed it! There was a 3rd option but it escapes me at the moment.   I ordered the same thing I had on sunday - white wine blend and bruschetta, soooo good! I crave it.  I have to say, the customer service is superb. I actually was able to have a relaxing lunch with a wiggly 2 and 4 year old. Fantastic!

I'm so sad writing this review because I had such high expectations. I blame my husband for talking up the place so much.  Totally overrated. Don't get me wrong, I'll eat anything, anywhere if it's good, so the totally sketched out location, and dive-y no frills decor (decor is the wrong word, there is no decor) didn't bother me. But I have to say, I've had vastly better Mexican food. We got the machaca hard tacos and the machaca was so bland. The chicken soft tacos were ok. The cheese enchilada was awful. The killer for me was the tortillas used in our dishes weren't fresh. Also, they ran out of tortillas which I wanted to purchase and I was bummed about that.  My husband, who used to work in the area and frequented Carolinas says that this experience was a fluke, perhaps because we were there fairly close to closing time (although I don't think that's a valid excuse).  I wasn't impressed. Hubby wants me to return for breakfast with him and give this place another shot. Eh, I won't go out of my way to come back but if I'm in the area (unlikely) I guess I'd be willing to give it another try :/

My family has been coming here since I was a little girl. For over 20 years now...  Ray, the owner, feels like a family member. I love that he chats it up with his customers. The guy is hilarious and makes you feel like a valued customer.  On to the food...did I mention I've been coming here for at least 20 years? I have had EVERYTHING on the menu and LOVE it all! It is authentic and delicious. I lived in Hawaii for a few years after college and whenever I'm missing the islands I head over to Aloha for some ono kine grindz :)  Simple place, casual, no frills. Classic plate lunch style.   The best Hawaiian food in AZ, no question. You need to go.

So so delicious!!!  I got to sample lots of the flavors and the fam settled on cheesecake, tiramisu, bubblegum, birthday cake, and chocolate. The texture was spot on and the flavors were bold and fresh.   Friendly service and clean establishment. I also love the fact there are dairy free options. Awesome!  Really great experience and I'm sure I'll return. My only gripe is that it's expensive. A kids size is $3.14 without tax.

I really like this place.   Sure, it is true that it is a very crammed, no frills establishment. Not spa like at all so you will be disappointed if you want that environment. They do your facial waxes all out in the open for all to see, which is a little awkward. And kids are welcome - which was great for me today, as I just needed a quick polish change and had my 3 yr old in toe. I was VERY apprehensive about bringing my son but I figured it would be quick. They were just so great about it and made me and my son feel welcome and at ease. Just know there is a possibility kids could be there so that is something to consider.  All that being said, the customer service is fantastic. Always a warm welcome. Always a thank you when I leave. I for one really appreciate when a business owner makes me feel like a valued customer. Nail salons are a dime a dozen and I could go anywhere to spend my hard earned money. I like coming here because I like how I'm treated (seems simple enough but more often than not, businesses do not get this concept).  The prices are very reasonable too. They do a great job.

Unfortunately I need to downgrade my rating. I still think the service is great. Very friendly. However, there are some big things I'm noticing when I go back that really bother me...  It's increasingly cluttered and dirty. And most of the nail polish looks old and rancid.  I get a basic mani and pedi here, which was working fine for me. Each time they would try to upsell me to gel, and finally I gave in.  So at 3x the price for my normal manicure, they told me it would last for 3 weeks. Hardly. 4 days later, the polish on my thumbs were totally chipped and there were lots of air bubbles that popped up. Being that I had French, the bubbles look black on my nails. So I went back to have it fixed.  The girl did a really sloppy job. Polish is too thick. My polish is already peeling up and it's only been a week.  I already knew that their products are old so I would bring my own nail polish. But now I'm irritated because I feel like I was talked into gel and it only lasted as long as my regular manicure because they are using crappy old product (high probability) and the gel was poorly applied (lack of skill).  So, if i need something basic done for cheap and fast, I'll still go here. But if I need a quality job done, I'm going to pay a little more and go somewhere else.

Hidden gem. No frills, hole in the wall type of place (but pretty clean). The food is simply excellent. Authentic and delicious. Friendly service. I'm really amazed that the prices are so low! I got an order of spring rolls, 2 bowls of pho, 1 entree and a Thai tea for $20!!! Incredible value for the food quality.   I will definitely be back.

It's been a few months and although I've been able to try some other pho spots close by, for value, quality, and customer service, Saigon Pho wins in my book. Seems like maybe the month I downgraded them perhaps was a fluke (hopefully), because our food was excellent tonight. Fresh. And the customer service is always great here. Love this place and I'm here to stay!

I love this place. I've been to the Gilbert location a few times and this was my first time at Chandler. The food is so good and fresh. The yellowfin tuna wrap is to die for and only $7.99! It was less than my mom's chicken hummus appetizer, which was also delicious. I also liked the fact they have a great kids menu. The atmosphere is casual yet classy yet I felt totally comfortable bringing my kids there. Very interesting dynamic that is difficult to pull off.  I also had the sangria with my lunch and it was so refreshing and tasty. It was garnished with strawberry, and orange and lime slices. I appreciate that attention to detail. Not to mention a steal at only $3!  Customer service was good. We were greeted warmly and sat promptly. Our drinks came out quickly. Our server was friendly but not overbearing and our food came out fairly quickly.  I love eating healthy and the menu here impresses me. I also really liked the atmosphere, particularly the art pieces they have hanging. I will be back and hope to become a regular!

This location is the closest to my house. Honestly, I've never had a bad experience here. Although Starbucks is Starbucks, the employees are friendly and my drinks are always correct. Can't complain.  *They have a promotion going on right now where you get a free tall hazelnut macciato until 3/31/13. Just ask bc I don't think it's advertised. Got mine today!*

Not a fan.  Went here upon my sister's recommendation but she also said she hadn't been there in about 10 years. So I chanced it because I live really close.  We sit down and the first question our server asks us rather abruptly is, do you have a Groupon? I was like, uh no. Is there a Groupon? So I look on my phone and sure enough there was so I bought one -$19 for $30.  I was not impressed with the food at all. Every roll had cream cheese and krab mix in it or some variation of that. So not a great selection. Wasn't especially fresh and definitely flavorless. And the rice to fish ratio in the rolls was way off. They were like all rice no fish.  On top of that, our food took forever. Sigh.  Not a great value. Without the groupon our bill would have been close to $60 for some mediocre sushi.  So I guess a lot of people come here for their $20 all you can eat special. We decided not to because of all the rules and conditions. No sharing. If you don't eat it all, you pay for what you don't eat...seriously?  One bright spot was the service was pretty good.  Overall, won't be back :/

First, they don't answer their phone. Next, they are closed between lunch and dinner. Finally, it is ridiculously OVER PRICED for the area and quality. $43?! I literally pay $24 for the exact same order at another pho spot very close. I'm not opposed to paying out the nose for great food, but it better be just that. And it isn't.

PERFECTION.  Best restaurant in AZ hands down. It is over the top. From the moment you walk in, the service, the execution of the food, the wine pairings, the artistry of the menu, from the moment you leave - a handwritten thank you note, water, and chocolates in your car. Everything is on point. Pure artistry and close attention to every detail. Very, very expensive but worth it. The price point will probably keep me from becoming a regular but I very much look forward to returning again.

Oh how I love Target! This is my neighborhood store and I'm here at least 3 times a week. Seriously. It's always clean and the employees are friendly and helpful. It has groceries and anything I want/need is usually in stock. Now it has a Starbucks!

I'm not Catholic, but I attended today with my mom and sister who are interested in the church.  I really like this community. Very warm and welcoming, and very diverse. Also it's come as you are, which I think churches should be. But people were dressed as casual as shorts to dressed up in suits.   The parish itself is beautiful. I loved the music! The band and choir sounded so professional! It was very spiritually uplifting.   There is a prayer garden that has beautiful water features and a fountain. It was nice to sit there and take in the serenity.  Great parish!

I've been here many many times and always have a great experience. The food is high quality and fresh. I always get a pressed sandwich of some sort. The pizza is great too. And we always have to get a bread pudding with fresh whipped cream. Delicious!  And you absolutely must get an espresso drink here. Joe Johnston (the owner) brought the espresso machine over from Italy and OMG the espresso is fantastic! The cortadito is my personal favorite.  I've always had great service here as well. My only gripe is how you have to wait in line cafeteria style to place your order. Expect to wait a really long time if you go during lunch rush.

I wouldn't normally review a grocery store, but this one is my favorite. I seem to get the best deals here and you can't go wrong with the fuel points program. Customer service has always been good and they usually have what I need. Store is clean and organized well too.   But the thing that just puts it over the top for me to Yelp about it, there is childcare here! You don't even know how convenient and wonderful that is for me! My kids can go in and me get matching bracelets. I show my ID to drop off and pick up. And then I can shop in peace! It's wonderful.  I feel so lucky that this is my neighborhood grocery store. I actually would probably drive a little out of the way to enjoy this. Only a couple of Fry's stores have childcare.  Great store!

As a former LDS member, the whole mega-church concept is totally foreign and weird to me. And to be honest, we were only there to hear Paul Jr. speak and to see his new custom bikes.  I'm not a religious person but if I was I would definitely consider Cornerstone. I was really impressed with how warm and friendly and inviting everyone was. Very laid back, come as you are attitude and atmosphere and I LOVED that! And the music was great! Drums and guitars oh my! Not used to that after all my life of dull boring organ. They also have a cafe where I got myself an iced coconut mocha, which was delicious!  The kids center is amazing and very secure. They also had booths featuring different types of programs they offer. There is something for everyone!  Anyway, I was very impressed with this new church experience (and I'm pretty anti-church).

I'm here frequently for coffee since it's close to my kids school. We've had fundraisers here, playdates, etc. Plenty of room. Dining room is remodeled. Video games and a large play structure for the kids. The food is ya know McDonald's, but the employees are friendly and they get my order correct pretty much all the time (they can't seem to grasp light cream on the iced coffee though). Bathrooms are clean. No complaints :)

First time here this evening. Got a mani, pedi, and lip wax. I feel that I got a good quality mani and pedi. In fact, I recall thinking during my service that the tech was very thorough getting all the dead skin and rough spots off. I was also very impressed with the extensive selection of designs that are hand painted (no stensils!). Keep in mind, if you want a design, they start at $12 in addition to the pedicure. Also, they charge you an additional $5 to remove calluses, which I did not like. Shouldn't that be included in a pedicure?! I've never been charged for callus removal.  As far as customer service, I've been to enough nail salons to not misconstrue a lack of confidence in English as rudeness. So I didn't hold the aloofness of my nail tech against her. She did a quality job on my nails.  I do have one MAJOR concern about this place and that is the sanitary practices. Not everyone was wearing gloves doing the pedicures, the tools used looked like they had been sitting out for several uses. Futhermore, during my wax the tech kept RE-DIPPING the stick in the wax. That is a huge NO NO. I requested that she used a different stick each time she had to dip in wax but at that point I already knew the wax was contaminated if she is doing that with every client. GROSS.  My lip wax was also not executed correctly. She slapped on the wax sloppily on my face and then once she ripped off the strip she didn't immediately press the skin after so it was really painful.  I thought the price was high for pedicure - $25 without design, at least $37 with. Other services were reasonable - $12 for manicure, $7 for lip wax.   In short, I won't get another mani/pedi here because I'm concerned about sanitation. Same with the wax - YOU DON'T DOUBLE DIP THE STICK!   I would return if I just wanted my nails painted and a cool design.

I would give 0 stars if I could. Worst customer service I have ever had. Not even greeted when I came in. No one asked what I needed help with. Took forever for a very small job. Inefficient and unfriendly. Go to Kinkos, yes it's more expensive but you can get in and out fast and the staff isn't RUDE and doesn't mess up your order.

I've been going to Steve's before it was even Steve's (before him and Ned parted ways).  I love this place. Kinda sketchy location but I'm totally ok with that since I swear they haven't raised their prices in 20+ years. My fav sandwich shop in the east valley, even over Ned's (dare I say it). The reason I compare the two is because they are basically one in the same - same menu, same decor, right down to the old arcade games. Where Steve prevails for me is that I like their bread better and I don't have to deal with snotty Mt. View teens working at Ned's. Sometimes there are teens working at Steve's but they are so much more polite than Ned's employees. Usually though, there are the sweetest middle-aged ladies working at Steve's.  The food is really good. I've pretty much had everything on the menu over the years, but my favorite is still the poor boy on white with everything cold :) In fact, I love the subs here so much I had Steve's cater my kids birthday party last year.  Great Mesa institution. No frills. Just good sandwiches and friendly service. Good enough for me.

Probably the least favorite of the many festivals AZ has during March-April. Yet, I go every year! I'd probably enjoy it more if I didn't have to shell out close to $70 for my family of 4 just to get in!   The high prices (for everything) aside, it's enjoyable for the family. The shows are entertaining and fun. The food is delicious. We spend most of our money on the food.  I'm still on the fence on whether it's worth it or not. There are so many great festivals this time of year that are free.

I am so disappointed.  Went there early this evening for a celebratory dinner. We walk in and it smells, well, old. The atmosphere is cold and the place is kind of in disrepair. They need to just redo the interior design.  Our server, while pleasent, did not seem to do the normal things one would expect at a wine bar...no mention of happy hour specials, no mention of wine flights, no explanations about the wines...it was weird. I had to practically interrogate him for information.   The wine itself...meh. We sampled 6 in a flight and ordered 2 additional glasses.There were a few I did enjoy like the summer peach and the chocolate divine. But I think a normal wine drinker would find their wines way (way) too sweet and overall mediocre.  The food. Now this just makes me mad. I ordered the bruschetta sampler and the only one I even half way enjoyed was the blue cheese/grape. And while I thought the flavor was good, the execution was sloppy. I don't like to eat a meal that is not presented nicely.  The grilled shrimp one was NOT grilled or seasoned. It was cold and rubbery. Like it had been microwaved and left to sit. And it was coupled with a bland nasty hummas. Ick. I spit it into my napkin. Awful.  The prosciutto and fig, normally one of my favorite combinations, was not good. They put a bitter lettuce on top, which I don't understand, and an overpowering, sickly sweet sauce. It did not work well together at all.   Crabcake was ok. But $7 for a tiny little portion was irritating. Look, I get that it's tapas, but come on, it was a bite and a half. My husband got the rosemary meatballs which #1, were microwaved for sure, #2 drowning in marinara sauce which hid all the flavor.  They need a new chef.

Brunch meeting today with 2 colleagues. I haven't been here for awhile so we met at my suggestion. I was nervous considering the recent bad reviews. But happily, we had a very enjoyable experience.  First, our server was very sweet and attentive. It was not busy at all at 9am on a Fri and we were seated promptly with water right away. We had to wait awhile for our 3rd party to arrive but our server was totally patient and checked up on us.   I ordered coffee which was pretty good and piping hot. And she left the carafe for me. I loved the fact that they have stevia in the raw in the sugar holder.   I'm kind of an annoying customer at restaurants since I have (self-imposed) dietary restrictions, especially right after the new year trying to lose my holiday weight! On my order I requested all egg whites, fresh fruit instead of potatoes, whole wheat toast dry with butter on the side, and non-dairy creamer. It came out to close to $2 up charge for the changes, but whatever, I was so happy when my order came out correct and I didn't even have to repeat myself once. Awesome.  The food was pretty good and came out fast. Bacon was a little greasy and a little too much in my scramble. But overall, it was hot and fresh. You can always tell by the fruit. My fruit was very fresh.  My colleagues ordered the whole grain pancakes and huevos rancheros which both looked delicious. I got confirmation that they indeed were (I'm ordering that HR on my next cheat day! Yum).  Nice quaint place. We sat on the enclosed patio with the fountain facing the street. It was very nice. Will be back!

That was...weird.  So I stop in before heading over to Bounce U. I'm in Gilbert a lot and pass by this place often. Being on a recent local coffee shop kick, I decide to check it out. The location isn't the best. Not convenient as it's set far back from the road and not by any other shopping.  Upon walking in I'm immediately distressed at the fact that there is crap everywhere. Clutter, papers, knick knacks, old chairs, It's a cluttered MESS. Piles of stuff.   I try to decipher the menu, which is also cluttered and complicated. Give up and settle on an iced dirty chai. They don't have almond milk. Boo. Fine, I'll take soy. (Ok at this point it irritates me when local coffee shops don't have almond milk, no one drinks soy anymore!).  The guy, while very nice, was really...strange. Same with the lady typing away on her lap top who I can pretty much guess is the other owner.  My drink wasn't bad. Too much milk in it and I could tell they use a pre-sweetened chai. Whatever, it was ok. It did kind of bug me that the guy kept saying "charger" and I have no idea what that is. Finally since I'm the only customer I'm like, my soy dirty chai? He said yes but we call it a charger. Ok.  Behind the counter was in disarray as well.  It didn't look clean and orderly but they have a A rating sign from the health dept up. I couldn't see the date on it though.  Anyway, they thanked me and invited me back but honestly, I couldn't get out of there fast enough. Not my kind of place. At all.

Went here for a pedicure with a friend today. Some positives first...the place was pretty clean and they did a good job. Hot stone massage with basic pedi was nice.  However, customer service was awful. They were irritated when I didn't get a mani with my pedi. They were irritated when I paid with a card. Also, it's extremely awkward when they say it's $23 and then ask in an accusatory tone "just $23 on the card?" I would have tipped anyway. I always do at a nail place. So I didn't appreciate the attitude. Why don't they have a tip line on the credit slip?  And they messed up on my friend's gel manicure and wouldn't fix it because they were closing early for Chinese New Year.  Won't be back.

What's to say about this place that hasn't already been said after 801 reviews! It's fabulous! Great beer, great food, great service. They hit the trifecta.  Not only that, but I love that there is a wide variety of people here. Families with small kids, hipsters, college kids, old folks...everyone come on down! No one is out of place. We bring our kids all the time.  Last night I had the salmon blt and it was delicious! Hubby had the beer battered chicken fingers (his fav, he gets that every time).   All of their beers are fantastic, but I particularly like the oatmeal stout and the peach ale. Hubby LOVES the bourbon barrel ipa but that one is seasonal.  Great place!

Worst.experience.ever.  I totally agree with Lou on this...totally overpriced and crappy selection. I also bought a Groupon here and also felt like I didn't get a deal at all because the prices were so high. They didn't even have Malibu Red?! Which I have been wanting to try for awhile now.  I also felt skeeved out by the location. Like, I fully expected to see racks of porn when I walked in (thanks heavens I did not). And they bag their stuff in black garbage like bags, probably for the purpose of concealment. Obviously this place is for the clueless binge drinking college student.  The customer service was awful. When I asked about a particular vodka, the guy behind the counter condescendingly responded that he only drinks top shelf so he wouldn't know, snicker. Really? Apparently only the best for the dude in the stained t-shirt and a fu man chu. Plus, he could clearly see my husband and I were having trouble making a decision - no offer to help us out, no recommendations. And they either didn't carry what I wanted, or were out of it.  Ugh. Awful. I will never go back. People, stick with Total Wine.

Stopped in while kids were at piano because I desperately needed a manicure. I opted for gel because I just don't have time to get weekly manicures. I have to say, this is the best gel manicure I've ever had. No bumps or bubbles. Color applied evenly and smooth. Perfect manicure.   Customer service I thought could be better. Not very warm or particularly friendly. And I didn't like the smell of the lotion they used. But I'll still come back because the quality is excellent for the price.

I needed to see what all the hoop la was about! I went in expecting the worst, as I usually have a disappointing experience when a place is overrated.  Anyway, we spent the hottest day of the year (118 are you freaking kidding me?!) at the Science Center. I thought, ok PB is next door and there is no line, so we went for it.  It was about 4:45 and the place was practically empty! So the 6 of us rolled in and were seated immediately. Fabulous.  The menu is simple. Love that. We ordered the salad, roasted garlic pizza, margherita pizza, the Rosa, and the chocolate flourless cake.  Oh my stars. The food is excellent. What more can be said after 800+ reviews? My favorite was the Rosa pizza. Carmalized red onion, pistachios, rosemary...now I'm not a pizza expert (like I am with cupcakes and coffee lol), but this was probably the best pizza I've ever had. And I can't believe I'm saying that since I've traveled all over, and the best pizza ends up in my own backyard?   Chocolate flourless cake was also the bomb. So fudgy and rich and dense. So good!  Service was excellent too. Maybe because we were only  1 of 3 tables, but still. Food came out super fast, waters refilled, nice chit chat with the server about the owner Chris and the concept of the restaurant...I mean the whole experience from start to finish was perfect.  Great spot. Now, I would never wait for hours and hours. Just come for lunch or between lunch and dinner. But if you absolutely have to wait, it's worth it :)  Can't wait to come back!

Went here for dinner with girlfriends on Tues. Wasn't blown away.  It was difficult for me to find as there is no signage. I finally had to ask someone after wandering around for 15 mins.   The service was lackluster. Our server gave us the impression we were inconveniencing her more than anything. Not warm or friendly at all.  The menu was mostly sandwiches and salads all of which I wasn't particularly in the mood for. I was expecting more choices. I ended up ordering the Burger Au Poivre II...for $14.50, I was expecting WAY better quality.  I will give them credit for their very extensive cocktail list and the bar is well stocked with every type of quality liquor you can imagine. I had the celebration champagne which was tasty.  Beautiful atmosphere. I'd probably return for drinks at the bar but not the food or service.

Meh.  Went here because of the Yelp deal after we saw a movie. Ordered the fish tacos and was really disappointed. You can tell they use frozen fish. I ordered the fish fried, traditional style, and it was rubbery and greasy. Honestly, I've had way better at a chain like Rubios for half the price. It didn't even come with lime, but a tangy sauce that was way too overpowering. The rice was dry, the queso fresco on my black beans was rotten and the beans weren't all the way cooked. Nasty. I ordered a quesadilla off the kids menu with a side of fruit for the kids. It was pretty small and the fruit was a fruit cup NOT fresh fruit. Why wouldn't you serve fresh fruit? However, the salsa was good. Very smokey (chipotle perhaps?)  Needless to say, I was unimpressed with the food.  On the upside, the margaritas were good (and strong!). I had the skinny and my husband had a blended strawberry. They also have really good happy hour specials. The service was ok. Nothing spectacular but not bad.  I'd probably return for happy hour but definitely not for the food. It's pretty much a sports bar (lots of flat screens playing sports) that serves gringo style Mexican food.

Great atmosphere and customer service. The bartenders are awesome and made my husband and I few really good cocktails while we waited to go in the theater. However, the food is pretty mediocre. Overall, I had a pleasant experience and would return.

Unassuming little spot in a strip mall (seems like the best places to eat in AZ are) next to Fry's. Ordered an iced coffee with sugar free coconut syrup, sugar free mocha sauce, and unsweetened almond milk...PERFECT! I gulped it down and got one for the road. I also appreciate the fact that they got my slightly annoying order correct 1st try.  Hubby and I got the chicken salad croissant and a ham, cheese, spinach and mushroom omelet. Both were fresh and delicious. Eggs were fluffy. Salsa was really good too.  Customer service was warm and friendly. I think the cabin theme is kinda cheesy and unnecessary (seriously take down those ugly icicle lights or whatever they are) but the quality of the food and coffee and top notch customer service will keep me coming back. Great find!

I really (really) love Costco. This location in particular. I usually come during the week with the kids when it's not crowded to shop. And on weekends for the samples :)  The store is huge, clean, and well organized. I love that they carry a large variety of organic and non-GMO products. I find that those products in particular are a steal! They consistently have great prices on produce as well.  Customer service is over the top! I think this company is genius because they get that you really can do simple little things that make the difference in the shopping experience. When we leave the store, the associate always (always!) Draws a cute pic on the back of the receipt. Something totally simple and my kids LOVE it. And they give away free cookies to the kids at the bakery (however I learned this weekend not all locations do this...*cough*Tempe*cough*).  They also have the U scan here. Seriously you never have to wait in line ever! You can just scan your stuff as you shop. Then there is a seperate U scan check out when the associate scans your device and you pay. So fast and easy.  Thank God this is my neighborhood location because it's the best Costco I've ever been to.

Great boba drinks! I've tried the Thai tea, mango, and watermelon. Very good (very sweet if you like that, I do). The boba is excellent. I lived in Hawaii for many years so I know my boba :)  Where they lose 3 stars for me...  Customer service is severely lacking (bad attitude from the lady taking our order at the counter) and the drinks are overpriced. Plus, it's too warm in there. Come on, it's 110 degrees outside...stop being cheap and turn on the AC! Also, you must spend a minimum of $10 in order to use a debit card. I HATE when businesses do this because I never carry cash. It's so annoying.  Next time I'm getting the drinks to go.

I love Costco but I don't like THIS one.  I'm comparing to my neighborhood Costco in Chandler.  Customer service sucks. Guy at the Verizon booth today seemed totally pissed that we interrupted his time doing nothing and staring into space. Was short with us. Most of the sample people were rude. I'm actually shocked at what I experienced today since I usually experience awesome customer service at every other Costco.  This location also does not have U scan, so you have to wait in line no matter what. With U scan it takes me like 30 seconds to check out.  They also don't give out free cookies at the bakery to kids here. My kids were super disappointed when the lady told them they didn't do that.   I'll be sticking with my neighborhood Costco. Apparently they are not all the same.

Meh. I mean it's not terrible. Prices are ok. Service is ok. Pizza is ok (pretty greasy though). I did like the option of the different flavored crusts. We went with the garlic herb. It was ok. Other options were Cajun, parmesan, jalepeno, and a few others. The decor gives me anxiety. Way to much yellow but I guess that's a HH signature I suppose.  Nothing really to write home about.

I won free passes at raffle a few weeks ago and decided to take my son for his birthday. I'll say this...my kids always have a great time. Not an issue.  My issues are with the customer service and management here.   We came in Tues for the family bounce which lasts from 5-8. You can also purchase pizza and drinks for an additional $3.  We arrive with my sister in and her kids. I tell one of the girls working that we already have signed waivers on line and that I'm using my free passes for all four of the kids. Easy right? No. They made it very complicated because they were not communicating with each other and not listening to me.   They charged my SIL so I had to go back and get her money refunded. I had to tell them repeatedly that we already had waivers on line.  Next, we go into the first room. It stinks. Like mildew and pee. There are only 3 large bounce houses. The attendants werent watching the kids, but chatting amongst themselves. Which really irritated me as 3 older boys practically trampled my 4 year old to go down the slide.   We ordered pizza for 6 when we arrived at 5pm. My kids were hungry and it took forever for the pizza to arrive. The food came at 6:30. You only get 2 slices per person, so basically we ordered 2 pizzas.Why did that take so long? Another thing that bothered me is that 2 pizzas were sitting there for us, since 12 slices would be a pizza and a half. My husband goes to grab a 3rd slice and is told he can't have it. Well, what are they going to do with the other 1/2 of the pizza? It makes no sense.  Anyway, not my favorite place in the world, but my kids definitely enjoy themselves and it's another option to stay out of the heat.

I was contacted by the owner Brenna about my last review. Wow, I am just blown away at the level of professionalism displayed addressing my concerns. I was very happy to accept her invitation to return.  My recent visit was totally different than the last one. No confusion at the counter. The facility was super clean (no stinky smells), and it seemed like there were a lot more staff. Staff was also on point. They just seemed more organized and attentive. All the bounce houses were being monitored and I felt like my 4 year old was totally safe. However, I do think there should be an age limit. Probably 10 years old should be the max. It was a little too crowded that day for my liking but they had enough staff monitoring.  Anyway, so happy to see a vast improvement compared to last time. I brought 2 of my girlfriends and their kids and we all had a great time! We will be back for sure!

$3 movies! How awesome is that?! $2 on Tues! Even better!  Took the fam bam to see Epic last week (really cute movie by the way). Now being a discount theater, I kept my expectations seriously low. But I was very pleasently surprised!  After reading the reviews, I came with cash. But they now accept credit cards! Also, kids 3 and under are FREE!  And since we saved so much money on tickets, I thought hey why not splurge on some snacks? We got 2 kids packs which include popcorn and a drink for $3 each. I was fully expecting to be price gouged on snacks since tickets are so cheap. But the concessions are very reasonable! They also have a loyalty cup for $4, $1 refills.  We were in the large theater at the end. It was really clean, seats are comfy, and all the theaters are now digital projection (which I guess is new, along with them accepting credit cards). Very nice experience!  I will most definitely be coming back. $15 total for a movie and snacks?! Amazing value for the family!  My kids were also fascinated by the movie memorabilia here! They had a cool Pirates of the Carribean display that my son loved!  This place is great for a discount theater. I'd say even much nicer than the older Harkins theaters I've been to lately (Scottsdale fashion square, Arcadia), where they still charge and arm and leg for everything and are totally gross and uncomfortable.  Highly recommend!

I rarely disagree with Yelp reviews so I'm very puzzled by the experience I had here today, given the majority of good reviews.  First, the reason I decided to try this place was because we were in the area and it was ranked high on yelp. Perfect.  We walk in and it smelled funky in there. Like a heavy cleaner smell. It was really offputting.  We were waiting awhile before someone actually came to the host stand. Greeting was pretty icy. The guy was really weird. He grabbed some menus and handed my kids these doodle boards, which is great in theory, except for the fact that they were absolutely filthy.   The whole place was empty, except for one other couple, and the guy sat us right next to them. What's up with that? You could tell they were kind of thinking why we were sat so close to them when the entire restaurant was empty too.  It took us awhile to get through the menu. We didn't really get the whole Santa Fe concept and it would have been nice for someone to have explained their concept, as any server even half way paying attention could have seen we were having trouble deciding.  Also, we were there during a typical happy hour, but there was no happy hour menu or signage. I had to ask if they offered happy hour and what the drinks/items were, which irritated me.  So the guy that got us our drinks who we thought was our server, disappeared, and another server introduced herself and had a much better personality than the guy. She was very friendly, and talked up the menu quite a bit. Specifically saying how great the seafood is. Well, being from the east coast, we love seafood and settled on the lobster enchilada and salmon blt. My sister ordered a mini chimichanga.  The chimichanga was ok. I've had better. But it was a generous size. My dish and my mom's...terrible.  I got the salmon blt. The salmon was cooked fine. It wasn't dry. But it wasn't fresh. By a long shot. Very fishy. So gross. The bacon was greasy. The tomatoes were old and there was no lettuce. I was also expecting a fresh, authentic sopapilla, and a got a dry roll.  My mom's dish. Just bad. Rancid. And there is NOTHING worse than bad seafood. Our server deflected and said "hey I recommended the shrimp so you can't blame me." Instead of apologizing, offering her something else or comping the offending dish. Unprofessional.  A few positives...the bathroom was spotless and my margarita was good. The salsa is good. And our server was great until the end.  Overall, very disappointed.

This place is great! Came in for dinner last night after hubby was pleading with me that he HAD to have the Kings Hawaiian sandwich lol.  We go in and we are immediately welcomed, "welcome to firehouse!". We sit down and Barbara comes over to help us and explain the menu. She was wonderful! She told us the meats are sliced fresh twice a day and she got fire hats for the kids. They loved that!  So my husband gets the Kings Hawaiian, a meatball sub for the kids, and I got a corned beef. They were all amazing! Really good meats.  It is a little pricy. $6 and change for a sandwich and close to $9 for a combo. But it's quality. I also love that they have a few ways to donate to first responders. Will be back!

Wow! I used to live in Las Sendas and have been to the Mesa location several times and it has always been mediocre to just ok. Having moved to Chandler recently and seeing online that Dvine Chandler is starting a lot of specials this summer, I decided to check it out.  What brought me in was their summer backyard BBQ menu that they are doing on Sundays. We arrived at 12:30 and we were the only ones there (except for one older guy sitting at the bar).  We were seated right away and waters were brought out quickly. I was very impressed with the service. Our waitress was very warm, friendly and attentive. I was also impressed by the fact that when she forgot what I ordered (ok servers, just write it down and stop trying to impress us because it's super irritating when you forget or get something incorrect), she came back right away to confirm instead of guessing and screwing up. Good move, but just write it down at the beginning.  We had a party of 8 and I have to say I felt that we were really taken care of. Granted, there was no one else in the restaurant. I'll have to see what the service is like on a busy night. Our server brought my mom a sample of vodka to taste because she was ordering a new martini. I thought that was very thoughtful.  Our food was delicious. Everything was plated beautifully and the portion sizes were generous. The only exception was the calamari. It was tough and rubbery and the sauce was too sweet and greasy. Don't get that one. But seriously everything else was excellent. My husband said the pork relleno was the best thing he has ever eaten (and we have eaten at a lot of fine restaurants).  I liked the atmosphere too. It's much bigger than the Mesa location. I think it was about 2pm when the live music started, which was very nice.  Not a good spot for kids (which I guess goes without saying). I did bring my 3 and 5 year old since it was lunch time but there really aren't any menu options for them.  I had a great experience here, a couple hiccups, but the food to the service to the atmosphere was pretty good overall. Can't wait to come back!

Horrible. If I could give ZERO stars I would.  This place is totally overrated. I went there to celebrate my 30th birthday this past weekend and was utterly disappointed. The head hostess was rude and didn't seat my party until an hour after my reservation time, which then cut into my karaoke room reservation time. They charged me for the full 2 hours even though we were barely in there for 45 mins, which was their fault. Furthermore, I booked a small private karaoke room, which under normal circumstances (meaning, a REAL karaoke sized room) would have accommodated my guests. The person I made the reservation with failed to mention that a small room will only fit 6 people MAX. It's more of a closet than a room. Most of my guests had to stand in the hallway because there wasn't enough room for them to sit down. It was horribly embarrassing. The seats were ripped up and the karaoke machine was totally outdated. They had a huge book of songs that was also totally outdated. They are also supposed to include a small sushi platter with the room which they didn't, I had to actually go find a server and ask for my sushi platter to go. Then the sushi was not rolled correctly and fell apart when I picked it up.  I am VERY angry about my experience here. I feel ripped off and they ruined my birthday. I would have had a better experience making my own sushi and doing karaoke on the Wii or going to a karaoke bar in Phoenix where me and my guests could actually have room to breathe. Avoid this place. HUGE WASTE OF MONEY.  Very disappointing considering I frequent Sting Ray across the street and love it there. I expected the same quality since it is owned by the same people, but it's NOT at all.

Another satisfied customer here!  I found Scott on Yelp and thought, this has to be too good to be true...it's not! I called to book an appt and Scott promptly returned my call and email as well.   Scott and his crew arrived 5 mins early and they were clean, professional, and very warm and friendly. I LOVE the fact that he is mobile and could just come to me. The LAST thing I want to do is drag a 3 and 5 year old out in the heat and have to go somewhere and wait for hours.  Anyway, Scott asked me to show them my car and any particular concerns I had. I was really embarrassed showing them my car. I have 2 toddlers that destroy the inside on a daily, so my expectations were low that they could get out the chocolate milk stains on the ceiling, the gum on the seats, stickers on the windows, and whatever other kind of crust and goo spills, food, icees or whatever, that had been baking on the upholstery for who knows how long...  They got it ALL. I'm serious. They finished in about an hour and a half, which surprised me because they were very thorough. After they were finished, they showed me the car and I was literally standing there in shock. It was an unrecognizable new car.  Top notch work and customer service. Well done. I will definitely be a repeat customer!

Decided to come here for a drink with some girlfriends after seeing a movie. Big mistake.   So we have the unfortunate luck of picking this place on a Sat night when it turns into a dance club. You would think we were trying to get into the most exclusive club on the west coast by the way the bouncers hassled us at the door. In AZ, the driver's licenses don't expire for like 60 years or something and the bouncers made my friend get a second form of id because her driver's license was issued in the 90's and didn't have some hologram on it. Totally ridiculous. Then they wouldn't let us take our movie cups in even though we had emptied them out and threw the lids away. And the hostess was just flat out mean.  Finally after the hassle at the door, we walk in and the place is totally dead. What a joke! All that hassle and there's no one even there? You would think the owners would have promoters on the street begging pretty girls to come, but apparently they are going with the a**hole approach.  Finally, we get to the bar and order drinks. Bartenders were jerks. In fact, it seemed like the better looking the woman was, the worse service they got. Like they had something to prove. It was such a turn off. My friend was trying to make some friendly small talk with one of them and he snapped back "Don't think you're getting any free drinks from me lady" then walked away. So rude.  The bathroom was absolutely filthy yet, they had a bathroom attendant in there, which made absolutely no sense to me. I felt bad for the lady. It's not the type of place with clientele who are going to leave a tip for a bathroom attendant, plus having to sit in there all night in that disgusting place. Let the attendant go and hire a janitor!  Clearly the owners are delusional and think this place is The Mint when it's ghetto trash. Will not return.

I've literally never had a bad, nay, even mediocre experience here. Food is fresh, hot, out fast and so tasty. Service is perfect. Great value. My fav is #2 cheeseburger, protein style, ketchup and mustard instead of spread, and grilled onions :)

Took my grandmother here who was visiting from back east and we had such a delightful afternoon. There was a wine tasting that was fabulous. I actually bought a bottle from NC that tasted like tobacco (sounds gross but it was excellent). We sampled the watermelon beer, had a cappuccino which was excellent, and got a few salads and sandwiches for lunch. And of course we sampled ALL the olive oils. My husbands favorite was the chocolate olive oil and I liked the gourmet dipping olive oil.  It was way way too hot to sit outside but the grove of olive trees and picnic tables outside looked so inviting. I can't wait to return in the fall when it cools down!

LOVE Tumbleweed! Both the park and rec center! I'm here several times a week. They have a lot of classes to offer for both adults and kids. My kids are always signed up for something here. The facility is huge! It is really kept nice and clean. The exercise machines are in great condition. Good variety of fitness classes. Memberships are very reasonably priced. My only gripes are that child care is not included in your membership. You can buy a 20 visit pass for $40 for childcare. And they don't have a pool :( Otherwise, I'm a huge fan!  Keep a close eye on your kids at the park! It's huge and there are lots of kids so you could easily lose them if you're not paying attention.

Slow as molasses and got my order wrong. I ordered one iced coffee with sugar-free vanilla. How do you mess that up? I was the only customer in the drive through and it wasn't busy inside. No excuse for the incompetence. After reading the other reviews, they just don't care here apparently.

One word - Disappointing.   I decided to take my husband here for his birthday and because they were also participating in restaurant week. Also, they have great happy hour specials on Thursdays. Perfect.   First, I had requested on my reservation to seat us in a great seat with a view since it was a special occasion. They sat us in the back of the restaurant. Next, I ask for the happy hour menu and our waiter says happy hour is only in the lounge. So we couldn't get any drink specials which was annoying. Then we were brought out some crusty old stale rolls that were cold and hard and I immediately sent them back and requested fresh ones.   I ordered from the restaurant week menu and my meal was great. It is the only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1. My first course, the shrimp was a little overdone but had good flavor. 2nd course, my steak was cooked well. 3rd course, cake topped with mango and the basil ice cream was delicious.  My meal was not the problem. My husband ordered a veal porterhouse which came out looking like a big pork chop. Upon inquiring to the waiter, he told us veal turns white when cooked...what?! That is just flat out not true. I think our waiter was new on the floor because he was not knowledgeable about the menu (or steak in general) and just was b.s.ing his way through all night.   I didn't like any of the steak sauces. Too bitter or too sweet.   To top off the evening, our waiter took FOREVER to bring us the check.  I'm usually not a nitpicky person but when I'm spending $120+ on dinner, it better be well executed, delicious, with great service.  There are plenty of other spots in the valley to get a GREAT meal at that price point. Will not be returning.

Very different and fun dining experience! I was THRILLED to see Posh was participating in restaurant week because I've been wanting to try this restaurant for awhile but it is just out of my price range. $40 restaurant week menu and off I went!  Our servers were very knowledgeable and thoroughly explained the concept of the restaurant, the menu, how to order, etc. Every dish that came out was beautiful, unique and delicious. It was fun to be surprised as well!  I don't even remember all we had but there was squid, soft shell crab, scallops, albacore tuna, ginger soup, escargot, kangaroo(!)...all delicious and masterfully executed.  The restaurant itself is beautiful as well. Low light, candles. Very nice for special occasions as well as date nights.  I very much enjoyed myself. The price point will keep me from being a regular here but I'm hoping Posh will be participating in RW in September!

Omg this place is freaking adorable. For me personally, this is my ideal coffee shop. Local, family owned, community oriented, quaint, cozy, relaxing...I love the atmosphere!  Located right beside Joe's BBQ, there is parking in the back. Not a lot of room inside the shop, but there is plenty of seating on the patio. Lots of shade and misters so it's still pretty comfortable in the heat.  Now the most important thing...the coffee is great! I got an iced toddy with almond milk instead of cream. Next thing I'm going to try (on my cheat day!) is the Brucee which is an iced toddy with creme de cocoa and creme. Sounds delicious! Hubby got a cappuccino, which he gets at every coffee house we go. The drinks were great! Smooth and balanced. Good flavor. We also got one of Aunt Ninny's cookies which was delicious!  It got a little crazy during the rush. Seemed a little chaotic and disorganized. I was kinda stressed ordering. The son kept yelling "Dad! I need this! " or "Mom can you get me that!" I love family owned places, but that just didn't seem very professional to me. But I guess I would get the same if my kids were working for me lol.  Anyway, we had a great time chatting with one of the owners (the dad) once the rush had died down. He was very knowledgable and informative without being pretentious. I'm so appreciative of that. We have a great coffee scene in the valley but some owners can be real snobs about it. Not that way here at all. They are a lovely family.  Will definitely come back!

I have seriously mixed feelings about this office.  On one hand, I love Dr. Berger and Sharon is probably the best hygenist I've ever had. I would consider myself a long term patient if I were judging based on them alone. But here is where they lose 3 stars for me and probably ultimately my future business...  I discovered this practice through Groupon which advertised for $19 an exam, x rays, and cleaning. Great deal right? Wrong.   First, the customer service is seriously lacking in the front. Everyone seems rushed and stressed out. Appointments are always running behind. The first time I came to the office (for my kids appts), I wasn't even greeted. Next, if you are using a Groupon they basically shame you for using it. I really don't appreciate being referred to as a "Groupon patient", which in and of itself might seem harmless, but you just had to be there to hear the tone with which it was delivered to understand the offensiveness of it.  During the preliminary exam, my hygenist said I needed a deeper level cleaning which was not included in the Groupon and it was necessary for prevention of another condition. She had another lady (Lillian I think was her name) come in to explain the extra cost, which I did appreciate and she was very polite and broke down all the charges clearly. So I agreed to the extra charge for the deeper cleaning. But I didn't feel good about it.  It really felt like a blatant 'bait and switch'.  The cleaning and check up were fine. Sharon is awesome. But after...  I was embarrassed yet again upon check out by the front office staff. Referring to me as a 'Groupon patient'. This office also has a $50 for $100 Yelp deal that I tried to use but no one knew about it. They said I couldn't use it because I was already getting a deal with my Groupon. I said I wasn't getting a discount because I had to pay an extra $152 for a cleaning.  The way the whole situation was handled was just unprofessional and embarrassing. To stop the lady that was checking me out from continuing to blast my financial situation for all to hear, I finally just let her run my card just so I could get out of there with some dignity in tact.  I have a good friend who is a hygenist and asked her about the nature of the cleaning and she basically told me I got ripped off because their 2nd level cleaning is just a normal cleaning - what you would get at a normal cleaning in any dentist office. Furthermore, she told me I didn't get a discount because a routine cleaning doesn't cost $250 (they said I got a $100 discount because of the Groupon).  Anyway, I just thought the whole situation was shady. And it's really unfortunate because I really like Dr. Berger and Sharon but I have serious reservations about returning because of the admin and front office staff.

Went back on Thurs to get my teeth polished because the mouthwash they gave me at my last visit turned my teeth brown. Customer service was a lot better this time and the service was complimentary. I just can't bring myself to give this place a higher rating because I still feel my Groupon situation was an egregious bait and switch with no resolution on their part. Really love the hygenist Sharon though.

Trendy Mexican! I'm down!   I met a colleague here for lunch upon her recommendation. I was confused where the entrance was. But once I made it inside I was greeted warmly. Hostess seemed a little frazzled and made me wait to be seated while she took a phone call, which kind of annoyed me but I shrugged it off.  Anyway, we sat outside, luckily in the shade. Service was fantastic! Our server was very conscientious that we were having a business lunch and tried not to interrupt as much as possible, while still being totally attentive. It was great.  Food was phenomenal! I ordered a shrimp and fish taco. My colleague had the huevos rancheros. Both were excellent! My tacos were definitely on the small side and for $3.50, kinda pricey for the size. That being said, the shrimp and fish were cooked perfectly, everything was so fresh and tasty. Very pleasing.   I am definitely looking forward to taking advantage of their all day happy hour on Tuesdays!

I think if I were on death row, I would request Lolo's chicken and waffles and blue Kool aid for my last meal.  I don't come here often. But when I want to indulge in some excellent, crispy and not greasy, fried chicken and a sweet waffle, I run to Lolo's. It's so good. Be prepared to go into a food coma after your meal, so I don't recommend for a work lunch. More Sunday brunch where you can go home after and take a nap :)  Service has always been friendly and our food comes out fast.  My only gripes are that the wait is very long, which wouldn't necessarily be a problem but I feel like it's disorganized. There was a large table open for a while and we didn't understand why we weren't just seated there. The hostess was frazzled and confused.  I also think it's a bit overpriced. I wanted to try the hot wings until I saw that it was $12 for only 6! Really? That should be $7 tops.  And, I don't think the AC was working in the bathroom today. It was like walking into a sauna!  So, gripes aside, I love the food. Period. But I try not to come more than once every 3 months...I think that's how long it takes my body to digest a meal here.

Not a fan.  Just cancelled my membership. I signed up originally because of the youth programs and because it's within walking distance to my house.  The facilities themselves and staff are not the problem. I actually had good instructors for the classes and the equipment was in great shape and it's clean.  My problem is that it is way overpriced. Maybe in order to subsidize the low income members that go for free? I don't qualify for financial assistance so for $25 more, I could have a membership at Lifetime Fitness with every amenity under the sun for crying out loud. I think also because of their pricing structure, you get a lot of sketchy members going there.   Also, the main reason I signed up was for the youth programs, none of which are offered at this location for my kids ages (3 and 5) I guess because it's one of the smaller ones?   If you're single and low income or a student, it's a phenomenal deal. But families don't have access to many of the amenities and kids programs at this location and would be better off at one of the larger YMCA. Even at those you'll still pay out the wazoo if you don't qualify for financial assistance. Just not worth it for me and my family.

I've been to In n Out about a million times here in AZ and CA and I've never had a bad experience. The food is always good and out fast. They are always busy and deal with the crowds in stride. Very methodical and organized. The service here is always amazing. They smile, they are warm and friendly and I honestly appreciate that. Great company. Consistently good food and amazing employees. Well done.

I've been wanting to try Chompies for awhile since I was born in Philly and have been to NYC several times. It was a rocky start, which dropped them from a 5 to 4 stars, but overall, the experience was great.  First, we arrive around 11:30am and there are a few people waiting. There were 2 hostesses and 1 server (I think) standing there chatting amongst themselves. They didn't greet us or acknowledge us at all. I finally said EXCUSE ME do we seat ourselves or how does this work? The hostess took our name and said it would be a 10-15 min wait, which I thought was strange since it wasn't very crowded at all.   We did end up waiting 10 mins and were finally seated. Hostesses = fail.  Our server, Roxy, was AWESOME. The menu is so long and there are so many choices. Being our first time there, I had about a zillion questions and she was very patient and explained everything thoroughly, made suggestions, really helped us feel comfortable with the menu. She brought out everything so fast. I asked for a different drink because I didn't like the Arnold Palmer I ordered, and she brought a replacement in no time. We needed extra plates, and extra set of utensils because my 3 year old dropped his, and Roxy was on it. At the end of the meal Foxy brought my.kids 2 huge cookies (she asked permission first). Really great service.  On to the food...  To start they brought us 2 kinds of pickles - kosher and sour. Both were really good and crunchy. After pouring over the menu we finally decided on the Nova Lox bagel plate and the Dave's deli eggs benedict. Wow! First of all, these plates are HUGE. Don't expect to finish your meal. I was impressed with my bagel and lox plate. Served very traditionally - red onion, capers, cucumber...everything was so fresh and crisp...heaven! The smoked salmon aux really good flavor and texture. And the bagel...very fresh, toasted perfectly, really tasty, as was the cream cheese. Awesome execution of one of my traditional favorites. My husband had the Dave's deli eggs benedict which was perfect because it combined a lot of things we wanted to try- corned beef hash, latkes, eggs benedict - it really all came together beautifully. Great flavor. My kids split a kids meal - bagel and cream cheese and fresh fruit.  In short, the service and food were outstanding. I will definitely be back. And if they tighten up the front of the house and get their hostesses in check, I wouldn't hesitate to give this place 5 stars all the way.

Unfortunately, not a great experience. We still had to wait forever for a seat, then waited forever for our food. I ordered the same thing as I did before, bagel with lox. It was gross. Nothing was fresh. My red onion was translucent, like it had been frozen and defrosted. The whole thing was just unappetizing. Bummer. At least last time the service and the food made up for the wait. Not so much this time :/

Oh no no no  First impressions count!  I came in at noon for a mani and eyebrow wax. Customer service coordinator said to come back in an hour because the students were at lunch. Ok fine.  I come back and attempt to check in. There are about 5 students crowded around the front desk, just hanging out talking amongst themselves. I was like excuse me can someone check me in?  Of course I'm not in the computer because when I came in an hour ago, she just wrote me down in the book. Now I have to explain everything to this clueless student with the other ones looking at me like I have a problem.  Finally after about 10 mins of that nonsense, the original lady who wrote me in at noon came up and said oh I wrote her in. Gee thanks.   So a little frustrated I calm down and expect to get my services. Not so fast. Lady asks is he staying with you? Pointing at my son. Well, yeah I replied (I usually don't bring my kids to a salon, but this is a casual school environment so I didn't think it would be a problem.)  Then she said I couldn't bring him with me because of policy. Yeah I get it. And the policy is fine. But I had no notice of it even after looking on the website to see if it said  anything. So I said to her, why didn't you tell me that when I was here an hour ago when you saw him with me? Also, it doesn't say on your website you have this policy just to let you know.  Then she very rudely said, "well we assume people should know not to bring their kids to a salon. "  WOW  I walked straight out. Very unprofessional. Total waste of my time.

I love this place. Lindsay is phenomenal. I will never EVER go back to regular waxing with strips! My brazilians are super fast with no pain and minimal discomfort. I've been going to this location for awhile so imagine my glee when I discovered they opened a location close to my house in NE Mesa! YAY!!! Hopefully that location is as good as this one. All my waxes here have been superb.

I'm not exactly sure why this place isn't packed on a 112 degree day like today. The paletas are so delicious! We just happened upon the place because we parked in front of it. After our afternoon activities in the sun, a frozen treat sounded so good, and man did this place hit the spot!  No short cuts with their product here. The fruit is fresh and the flavors are bold and well-blended. I got the mango con chili which had just the right amount of heat. Hubby got the Mora (blackberry with lavender) and it was delicious! So fresh!  Great customer service too. Very warm and friendly and she even offered to pack our treats in ice if we wanted to eat them later.  Price is on point. We got 2 paletas for $5. Great spot. Can't wait to return.

Marti L.'s review is spot on.  My husband and I took our kids last year, they were 2 and 4 at the time. I'm writing this review now after being reminded of this place by my sister in law who wants to have her son's bday party here.  First, the pics on the website are totally misleading.  Basically, older kids will be totally bored, it is overpriced, the bounce house was FILTHY, the "petting zoo" was a bunch of creepy reptiles that looked like they weren't supposed to be there. Seriously, a crocodile with its mouth taped up with duct tape? My kids were terrified! And I was concerned about the health and safety of the animals.  The normal animals you would expect to see are kept in pens around the periphery and you cannot pet them. You wouldn't want to anyway. The animals and their pens are filthy.   The "hayride" was the worst part. It takes you around the edge of the farm where you get a view of garbage piles and neighboring buildings.  My kids did enjoy decorating the pumpkins, although it consisted of just sticking foam stickers on the pumpkins.  Won't be back.

I got a gift card here for Christmas and I'm so happy I did! I have been going to a chain that I was satisfied with so I wasn't really looking. I am always reluctant to go to a new waxer (bad past experiences). We'll let me just say you can put your mind at ease! They are the best! I've been getting waxed here on a monthly basis since Christmas. Every time has been fantastic. Great customer service, the facility is clean and calming. And no high pressure to buy products. Love it. Also, you get a discount when you pre-book your appointments. So I ditched the chain in support of a local business who earned me as a loyal customer. I highly recommend!

Hidden gem alert!  It doesn't look like much from the outside and it's not in the main hub of downtown Chandler. But as soon as you walk in you feel like you are in a completely different place!  The cafe used to be a small house. Not much room inside, but there are plenty of tables on the patio and in the lovely gardens. It is the perfect time of year to sit outside and take in the beauty and serenity of the gardens.  Also, there is an exotic bird sanctuary at the far end of the garden. My kids got the biggest kick out of the macaws saying "hello" and dancing. Luna was our favorite! We also sat and played a few games of checkers.  Our food seemed to take awhile but other than that, the service was great! Very attentive. Our server even told about the cafe, how long they have been there, how they brought the bird sanctuary in, very interesting! She also told us about the brewery that will be opening next store which we are really excited about!  And speaking of food, it was delicious! I got the Hawaiian French toast and my hubby for a breakfast burrito with fresh salsa, so good!  A few things that would make this 5 stars in my book...they need to carry non-dairy milk options. They didn't have almond or even soy. And I would have loved a cappuccino or some espresso drink. It just seems fitting with the gardens to have espresso. That would be lovely.  Overall, great spot. Family friendly, great service. Will be back!

This review is more about the birthday party experience we had here. The park itself is One of our favorite parks and I take my kids all the time. There is a big playground, small splash pad, a lake where you can feed the ducks (my kiddos love that). It's beautiful.   We had my daughter's birthday party here and I think it's a good value. About $100 for unlimited ride bands for 9 kids and 2 adults. None of the adults wanted to ride rides so they just let 2 more kids use them. You also get a party host, ice cream, balloons, and you can bring in your own food (which saved us quite a bit of money).   That all being said, we were very disappointed that the train was not working for most of the party. The kids had to ride the carousel the whole time. They were still going to charge me full price until I complained, then they reluctantly offered me a 10% discount.   Furthermore, the party host does not host. She helped put up the balloons and then sat there the whole time. I had to ask her to do everything - get the cake, put on ride bands, etc. I paid extra for the package with the party host so I wouldn't have to do those things. I thought she would be hosting the party and lead the kids through some sort of a schedule. When she gave me the comment survey to fill out, I told her what I was going to put on the form about her hosting and she got very defensive and said those things weren't in her job description so it wasn't her fault that I had those expectations of what a party host does. I wasn't going to argue with her but management really should clarify that they don't actually host, just help with set up and clean up.  Overall, not 100% thrilled with the party experience here, but I will continue to take my kiddos as we very much enjoy the park itself.

Not blown away, but it's not terrible.  Pros: very clean, nice bright decor, local and family owned. Fresh and healthy menu.  Cons: VERY overpriced. They are really stingy with the portion sizes. I had to ask if the drink cup I received with my "special" was a water cup, it was that ridiculously small. The food is healthy but not at all flavorful.   Note: THEY DO NOT HAVE PANINIS even though it says that on the menu, which was disappointing since that's what I wanted. I don't think the owners know what a panini is honestly. You get a toasted sandwich.   I had the Green Chicken panini, which wasn't a panini at all, just a tiny toasted sandwich. It was really bland. They need to throw a little salt and some red onion on it. Something. My husband had the chicken salad wrap, which was a little tastier, but not much.  If they would season the food, up the portion sizes, switch to normal sized drink cups so I'm not insulted when they hand it to me, OR lower the prices, I would probably give it a second chance. Since my husband no longer works in the area and I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, I probably won't be back.

This review was from April but was removed because it was posted on the Scottsdale Waterfront's location...  A miss unfortunately this time...  My 2nd time here and I went to the location in North Scottsdale (Hayden). Not a great blow out. My hair was totally flat. I was expecting WAY better given my previous experience. Darn. I have one more groupon left, hopefully the blowout will be a quality one like my first. The customer service and atmosphere were just as great at this location, unfortunately my stylist wasn't skilled :(

A+++++  It's expensive but well worth the VIP luxury experience you get. Everything is beautiful and the customer service is superb. I can't say enough great things about iPic. I'm a regular. We just saw The Hunger Games there last week. Hubby ordered the filet mignon sliders and a margarita. I had the mahi mahi street tacos and the rose champagne.  All phenomenal. Our server was quick and attentive and very warm and friendly. We had the creme brulee cheesecake for desert, which was amazing, and timed perfectly so we could eat it as we enjoyed the ending of our movie.  Upgrade to premium plus (become an iPic member to save some money) - you get the best seating in the theater, pillow, blanket, free popcorn and valet. Awesome.  This is the best movie theater ever.

I completely agree with Ray T's review. This is Ono Hawaiian BBQ with a different name. I was pretty disappointed. The shrimp and chicken katsu tasted previously frozen. Mac salad was good. BBQ chicken was good. Manapua not so good (they were small compared to a normal sized bao and I didn't like the sauce flavor, too sweet or something). We also waited 20 mins for our food.  I've had vastly better plate lunch in the valley. And if you have Ono's near you, no need to make the drive out here for this. Same stuff. Same quality. I'm seriously baffled as to how they won a Best of Phoenix award.

Not.impressed.  I recently moved around the corner and this place has been on my hit list to try. I met some girlfriends around 6:30 for dinner and drinks. Happy hour goes until 7 so I was pleased about that. The place had a good crowd but wasn't overly busy, as expected for a Tuesday evening. I read the mixed reviews, so I didn't really know what to expect.  Unfortunately, it wasn't a great experience for me. I arrived a little after my party and had to wait forever for our server to take my order. Since it was happy hour, I ordered a white sangria. Took forever to come out and it was disgusting. I had to send it back. When I sent it back, my girlfriend told me she had sent hers back right before I walked in and forgot to warn me about it. It tasted so unusual. Like, flat Sprite out of a mildewy dirty soda machine. Gag. And there was no fruit in it (?)  I don't know what our server was doing (we saw her a total of 3 times in the 2 hours we were there) but the manager came over to check on us. When I sent the sangria back she was apologetic and recommended a white wine. It was a buttery chardonnay and very tasty. And she also comp'd the drink for me which I appreciated. When she came back with the glass she examined it and saw a spot and went back and brought me a clean one. I appreciated that as well. That took this review from 1 to 2 stars.  On to the food. I tasted the crabcakes, bbq shells and cheese and parmesan fries. Not a fan of the crabcakes (in all fairness, I'm from the east coast and ridiculously hard to please when it comes to crabcakes), but they were flat, too much filler and too little crab, and not seasoned well. They should just take the bbq shells and cheese off the menu. It's lazy and gross. The flavors just don't go together. The fries were good. Nothing I haven't had before though.   Service (by our server) and the food were seriously lacking. I'm willing to give it another shot since I'm so close and I've heard their breakfast is really good. But I left this evening really disappointed.

Happy hour time!   After a rough start, it really makes me happy to come back and find that this place gets better and better each time.  Hubs and I weren't really hungry but wanted a snack. I ordered a red sangria and a pita pizza. Hubby ordered 24oz beer (for only $4.50!) and the artichoke salad, which wasn't really a traditional salad, but a board.  Everything was fantastic. My pita pizza was amazing! Everything I love...arugala, mozzarella, prosciutto, roasted tomato, balsamic...oh heavenly deliciousness!  Our bill was around $24. Not bad at all! Service was great too. Very happy!

More like a 2.5 I guess...  Very cute hipster ambiance. Loved that. But be prepared to get cozy with total strangers. It is a very tight space.  Also there is very limited parking. If you have a larger car/ truck/SUV, don't even try.  I ordered the chicken pho and traditional spring roll. The food left a lot to be desired. When I go to a Vietnamese place for the first time, I see if they can nail the basics before I venture to the other items on the menu. I'd say this place is catering to an American palate, so I thought it was bland and not as well executed as I thought it should be.  I thought $15 was expensive for what I got. I can pay $6.95 for some seriously good authentic pho at that hole in the wall place across from MCC, but hey, I guess you pay extra for the atmosphere and location (just don't expect the food quality to match the price point).  Service could be better. I wanted to order another drink mid meal and try a desert but was never asked if I wanted anything else. The servers were rushed and it was difficult to get their attention.  So all in all, it's not great, it's not terrible. I'd probably return for a happy hour, otherwise I'll stick to the authentic places.

Talk about shocked, and not in a good way. I haven't been having good luck with Yelp lately apparently.  My in laws just moved to Gilbert and asked me to recommend a place for dinner close to them. Of course I consult yelp and thought this place would be a slam dunk because of the great reviews. Wrong :(  We walk in and the atmosphere is really awkward. It was dead silent and everyone was staring at us because the seating arrangement is super close and awkward. They have white linens, which typically indicates more upscale, but then they have a tv blaring in the background at the bar?  The service was great (until the end). I would agree with other yelpers that they are way too anxious to clear plates. They were on it, but I thought it was ridiculous to ask my sister in law to take her plate away when there was practically a full salad on it and she was still eating it. Get a clue!   But I was very happy that our waters were refilled, bread baskets kept coming, I dropped my fork and they brought me another in like 2 seconds...very attentive service.  Despite the excellent service and the ok atmosphere (rearrange the seating and get rid of the tv!), it really is all about the FOOD am I right?  This is where this place completely falls apart for me. They simply cannot justify charging the high prices they charge. The quality and execution simply do not match the price. And don't get me wrong, I have NO problem shelling out for great food (I went to Kai for my birthday for crying out loud), but these prices offend me here.  We ordered calamari and stuffed mushrooms for appetizers. Calamari was rubbery and the garlic and white wine sauce had no flavor and arrived luke warm and got cold in like 1 min. Mushrooms were tough and chewy and too salty.  My husband ordered the veal francese. Veal was tough. I just didn't like the combo of flavors but that could be a matter of taste. No excuse for the veal though. His dish came with a side of pasta, which was burned. Totally inedible. I wanted to send it back but my husband hates sending things back and "making a scene".  I had the ravioli. It was excellent. I could tell the pasta was homemade and fresh.  SIL had the chicken parmesan with a side of fettucine alfredo. She said the chicken was dry and the breading was soggy. It did appear that way. The fettucine alfredo was very good.  Her husband got the special - veal with gorgonzola sauce. Same problem with the veal, tough overcooked. The sauce was pretty good.  It took FOREVER for our check to come out. Not sure what that was about since they were very attentive the rest of the meal. Our bill came to $123 and change. Keep in mind - no drinks, no dessert, and I had an appetizer for my meal. OUTRAGEOUS for some pretty mediocre food.  If you do take your chances going here, I would only get the pasta dishes. Everything else we got was not good. And you probably won't get out of there for under $100.  I won't be back.

Pretty much my favorite sandwich place to eat at in Mesa!  This is how it should be done - great fresh food, great customer service, modern hipster ambiance. I LOVE IT. The end.  My favorite sandwiches are the grilled veggie and goat cheese and prosciutto and fig jam. Actually, everything is good here. Seriously.   Also, try the coffee! The coffee probably doesn't get much play there (Mormons), but it is excellent.   Well done. I always make it a point to hit up UP if I'm in the neighborhood.

Just returned from a trip to San Francisco and I couldn't get the amazing dumplings I had there out of my head. I'm so happy this place is close by!  We ordered the pork and shrimp dumplings, onion pancake, beef stir fry noodles, meat pies and...XLB!  Yes folks, they have XLB (soup dumplings) here, which is my favorite. It's not on the menu but they will make it if you order it. That bumped my rating from a 4 to 5 star.  My kids also enjoyed watching the ladies hand make the dumplings.  Bottom line, the food here is authentic and delicious. They take pride in it. Customer service is warm and friendly and our food came out fast. And it's cheap! None of the dishes we ordered were over $8.  Great spot. Now, it's not the best northern Chinese food I've ever had, but it's pretty top notch for Phoenix. I anticipate being a regular!

I'm lactose intolerant and this place was SO worth the bubble guts (sorry tmi).  There was a pretty long line when we pulled up Fri night. But I was pleasantly surprised that it moved really fast. So don't let the line deter you.  I got the Madagascar vanilla topped with salted caramel. Oh hell yes...YES! Mouth orgasm. It was blissful. Get it.  My daughter ordered strawberry which was also amazing and fresh. We were able to sit outside at the tables in the back which was lovely.  My hubby ordered a cappuccino and said it was not good though :(  I went back after the line died down and tried samples of all the flavors :) Vietnamese coffee, mint chocolate, blueberry, toasted coconut, praline...they were all DELICIOUS. You can tell they use really high quality ingredients.   Service was really friendly too. They totally didn't mind letting me sample everything and chatting. They also made a few recommendations.   The shop itself it totally cute too. Retro decor with old school candy, gum and toys to purchase as well.  Can't wait to come back!

I decided to try this place because I had a Groupon. Blowouts for me are hit and miss since I have kind of tricky hair. I must say, my stylist did a fabulous job! Best blowout I've ever had. My hair was full and bouncy 3 days later! The whole experience was relaxing (great scalp massage!) and I felt very pampered. Great customer service too from the moment I walked in until I left. I loved the beverage service when I was greeted too. Very classy. Phenomenal place. I will definitely return!

Fantastic authentic Mexican food! Wow. I got 2 carne asada tacos. Only $1.50 each. The meat was tender and flavorful. Not fatty at all. I also got a horchata. Delicious!  Great customer service. Very friendly. I can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu.

Very pleased! I've been hopping denist offices since we moved from Mesa to Chandler and have had the WORST luck. Until I got a flyer in the mail for Fountains. $25 for new patient cleaning and exam, I thought I'd give it a shot since my family was due for cleanings.  I schedule cleanings for my 2 kids. We arrived at the appt and we were warmly welcomed right away. Some quick paperwork to fill out (bonus: they also have the new patient paperwork online so you can fill it out at your convenience) and then the hygenist Nicole came and took us back. She was really sweet and great with the kids.  Then Dr. Ramsey examined them. My daughter had a strange looking tooth on her x ray and he really took the time to explain to me exactly what it was and what my options were.   I really like this office because I feel that I was treated as if I had been going there for years and that they genuinely care about your health. Dentists are a dime a dozen, especially in the east valley. So it's nice when a practice doesn't look at you solely like you have dollar signs on your forehead. That was nice. (How sad that I'm actually so amazed at being treated like a human being at a dental practice!).   Furthermore, they have a very good in house dental plan for those who don't have dental insurance. There is an enrollment fee and then you get your cleanings for $25 and 30% off other procedures.   I think I've finally found a practice I will stick with!

I had pretty much the exact same experience as Angela M. a couple weeks ago. Also, read the 'not recommended' reviews on this business. Most of those are filtered because they just don't have enough reviews to make it past the filter. They are very eye opening.  Like so many others, I hired them base off their overall Yelp rating. Big mistake. I should have read through the reviews because it seems like what happened to me happens often. So buyer beware.  They quoted me $160 for a DEEP clean, which I thought was on the expensive side, but I figured they would be getting the stuff I don't clean on a regular basis and I have a 4 bedroom home.  So the good...  Scheduling an appointment is very easy and they are able to come out quick. Juan, the owner, is very responsive.  It all pretty much went down from there.  The day of the appointment I emailed the office with some specific requests. Like to make sure to clean baseboards, kitchen sink, wet wipe behind sink, dust fans and air vents, dust blinds. Most of my requests were already included in the deep clean, but I just wanted to make sure they were addressed. I also left a note of the same requests and my house key (as I would be at work when they arrived).   So I assumed a team would coming, given the size of my home and the level of cleaning that was to be done.   While I was at work, I received a phone call that Blanca had to pick up a lot of things so I was going to be charged a $25 "organization fee"? I was like, there is only one person there? And a fee for picking up and you're a house cleaning service? Unreal.  So I emailed the office manager to object to the fee because it was not disclosed to me prior to the appointment.   Once I returned home, the house was tidy, but it was not deep cleaned in any way. No dusting was done at all. Baseboards were not touched. I asked for my washer to be cleaned (just the top) and that was not touched as well.  So I contact Juan right away and sent him pictures of everything that was not cleaned that was supposed to be. He apologized and offered to send Blanca out to get what she missed. I thought that was a bad idea and sure enough, Blanca arrives the next day with a bad attitude. I mean she was extremely rude so I just had her leave after about 10 mins.  I email Juan to update him of the situation and he offered me a $15 refund for the baseboards. I was really offended at that because it wasn't just the baseboards. It was everything. I didn't receive the deep clean I paid for at all and Juan ultimately gave me the run around with no resolution.  Don't waste your money.

After I posted my Yelp review, I received an email from Juan offering me a refund and asking me to take down my review. I have since been refunded in full and greatly appreciate it. I added an extra star for the refund. However, I don't feel comfortable taking down my review, because that is the whole point of Yelp. Hopefully this business will improve their practices and others will benefit from my experience.

So happy to have found a great salon close to my house! I love the ambiance and decor. Very clean and bright. Greens, yellows and bright whites are so happy and inviting. No strong chemical smell because the products are organic, I love that.  The customer service is over the top. When I arrived I was greeted warmly by the owner Stephanie, who was very friendly and made me feel so welcome. She checked me in and offered me a drink and said to help myself to a gorgeous spread of treats.  My stylist was Jenna. She was great. I liked her personality. She is a real trooper with a great work ethic. The reason I say this is because number one, I'm half black so my hair is a little more challenging to deal with, but she didn't seem intimidated at all. I wanted highlights and because my hair is so dark, it took a really long time to lift the color. A really long time. In fact, the salon closed at 6 and I didn't even leave until close to 8pm! But the staff was super nice about it and didn't make me feel rushed. When I was checking out, my phone was dead and I couldn't pull up my Yelp voucher. It wasn't a problem. They just let me email my voucher #. Great customer service! Seriously.  The only thing that is keeping me from giving 5 stars is the styling of my hair. The cut was great and so was the color, but the blowout was not good. My hair was a frizzy mess when I left and I had to style it at home.   In all fairness, at this point 2 hours past closing time, Jenna was probably exhausted, I know I was, and everyone just wanted to go home already. So I'm not sure if it was the situation or technique or what. I do know that as soon as she pulled out a metal vented round brush, my hair was going to be frizzy. I've had enough great blowouts to know with certainty you have to use a huge round brush with natural bristles on my hair, and then your pulling technique needs to be on point and kind of aggressive.   For me personally, a blowout is my test for the skill level of a stylist. For some it's the cut, other it's the color. And unfortunately, my blowout was not good. A good stylist should be able to transition from caucasian hair to ethnic hair in my opinion. And not that Jenna wasn't good. She is and I would highly recommend her. But if I'm being truthful here, the blowout skills need work (on my type of hair).  All in all, I really did have a great experience and will return. I'm hoping the styling was a fluke just because of the overall circumstances. I have another appt in 6 weeks so we'll see...

Oh wow! Delicious! So good!  Randomly took the kids last night for a treat and apparently we have awesome luck because this is some of the best gelato I've ever I had. I got the caramel macchiato and the kids got strawberry and bubble gum. Flavors are fresh, bold, and well-balanced. They even put a vanilla pirroette on top. So adorable and I just love it when a place pays attention to detail! Then an employee came around with a tray of water. Awesome! Customer service was really great.  The only downside is that the place was so packed (on a Thursday!) that I didn't get to sample anything because I felt so rushed. Maybe I'll come in on a weekday morning so I can take my time sampling! Also, this is a total Mormon hangout. I'm not bothered by that at all but just so people are aware.

This place is awesome! I came here last night for my sister's birthday party and we had a BLAST!  The price includes a beverage and you can choose from a great selection. I had a yummy Pinot Grigio and I tasted my friend's sangria and it was delicious! They also had a nice spread of snacks for us as well - crackers and cheese, cupcakes, carmel corn, cookies...it was adorable.  We just happened to come on Ladies Night and I highly recommend it. They have an awesome music playlist, a champagne toast, and prize giveaways! We also got a gift bag with nail polish, nail file, cute owl magnets, and coupons for cupcakes and body wraps. There were also vendors there (a body wrap company and origami owl jewelry). Fantastic!  The instruction was easy to follow and our instructor was up beat and encouraging. She came around to answer any questions and give positive feedback. The staff was amazing as well. They were all really warm, friendly, and helpful.   I can't wait to come back. Seriously, what is better than painting while having wine with your girlfriends?! It's so relaxing and FUN. Brilliant business idea!  The Brush Bar is a MUST do!

Well that certainly was delightful! I'm really impressed with this place.   Very professional and great customer service. I was greeted warmly when I arrived and offered a bottled water. Fantastic! I've never been offered a drink at a nail salon. The guy that greeted me escorted me to the chair and introduced me my tech, Lucy.  The place is so CLEAN. All the techs wear gloves while doing pedicures and they immediately clean the tubs out after every patron. I watched them do it every single time after every person while I was there. What a relief!  The atmosphere is just different than your typical nail salon. Everyone seems like good friends. It doesn't feel like anyone is talking crap about you in another language (you know what I'm talking about).  Best pedicure I've had for the price. Hot stone massage included with a basic pedi! Mani was excellent as well. Very thorough. So relaxing. $5 upcharge for callous removal must be a new thing as it happened to me at another nail place and I wasn't happy about it.  The prices are so reasonable for the quality of service. For a basic pedi/mani combo is $34. Well worth it.   I will definitely be back!

The food and ambiance is great. SERVICE IS AWFUL!!! Went there this Sunday for dinner with my family and last night with friends. Different waiters. Both incompetent. One didn't know what a cucumber roll was (what?). The other spilled water all over my dress when I specifically asked him not to clear drinks over me (he tried to impress us by overloading himself and spilled on me as expected). We had to send all of the water back because all the glasses were dirty. Gross.  Everything takes FOREVER. Both nights if someone asked for anything - utensils, chopsticks, napkins, water (yeah, we had to ask for those), our server either would forget or not come back with what we asked for. They are too busy chatting amongst themselves instead of working (we can see you back there!)  Honestly, the place has potential. The food is good so they have that going for them. But the service is so utterly lacking to the point the food can't even make up for it. They need a management overhaul.

Alright, I've been here at least 4 times. This is the most bi polar restaurant.   I will say this, the food is good. But not so excellent to the point of putting up with awful service and chaos. And it's overpriced, so make sure you use a groupon here (which are frequently offered - which I take as a sign of business troubles if that's the only way you can get returning customers).  Anyway, we came in during happy hour. Our server was absolutely clueless. A recurring theme with the servers here. He couldn't answer not one of our questions. He didn't know what a cucumber roll was (I've had this issue here before).  Our plates were not cleared once during the entire meal, nor were our waters refilled even after asking a few times. We just kept stacking our dirty dishes to the side hoping someone would pick them up. No one did.  We had to wave our server down for the check and then waited forever for it. Upon receiving the check, he had charged us $10 for 2 cucumber rolls. Seriously? It's rice and cucumber that I get for my kids.  I disputed the charged and he said there was nothing he could do. So naturally I asked to speak with a manager. Our server (not the manager, who wouldn't speak to us?) came back and said, oh I guess my manager said he would just charge you happy hour price for the rolls. OK. That's all I wanted and he had to make it a big damn ordeal. Also, I see the manager looking at us just totally annoyed. He even walked by our table a few times and wouldn't even smile or say hello.  Yeah, there are just way too many great sushi spots to put up with this bs. I can't even believe I've allowed myself to be subjected to it more than once.

Groupon ran a few specials to this place and I bought a few thinking $5 for a ticket and drink was a great deal...NOPE!  I love the dinner/movie theater concept, so I was excited when Groupon ran their special and was looking forward to trying this place out. I love IPic and the new AMC dinner theaters. But this place does it all WRONG. Horrible execution. HORRIBLE.  First of all, if you don't have "reserved" tickets, you need to show up at least an hour or two early to get a decent seat. Shows are always sold out. Theaters are too small and they block out 60% for "reserved" seating. Should you find yourself with only the front row available with the rolling office chairs, (this has happened to me twice now), you can't upgrade your tickets to reserved seating at the box office. You have to purchase all new tickets through the kiosk or online for a $2 surcharge (a very annoying, anti-customer service move). A clever backhanded way of getting an extra $2 from the customers. That is bad business. By the way - the Groupon tickets are NOT reserved seating.   When I complained to the manager, he said there was absolutely nothing he could do about the situation (really? Nothing? What good are you as a manager if you have no power to remedy a customer's problem???). Then he proceeded to condescendingly explain the whole "reserved" seating thing - yeah, I get it, I'm not an idiot. So I said I probably would not be returning because everything about the place was such a HASSLE. His response: that's fine if you don't come back.  RUDE. BAD FORM.  I can't speak for the food because I didn't even get that far.  Awful place. Will not be returning.

I decided to try Primp and Blow because they offered a special on Groupon. I'm so glad I did! I went to the location by Scottsdale Fashion Square.  My stylist was awesome. She was very skilled and did a great blowout but also had a great personality as well. She made me feel relaxed and comfortable. I love the atmosphere. Great customer service. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because they charge you $10 extra for any hot tools styling, which I thought was annoying, and they don't have a look book. Those very minor issues aside, I had a great overall experience and will return.

What is going on at this place?  This was my 3rd experience at Primp and Blow (2nd time at Waterfront) and it was terrible. I had one Groupon left and decided to use it since it was Mother's Day.  When we arrived, all the staff seemed to be pissed off, like we walked in right in the aftermath of some horrible staff fight. It was very tense.   My service was rushed and uncomfortable. My scalp massage was awful - very rough and fast. My stylist hardly spoke to me. I don't even remember her name. I tried to strike up conversation to no avail. It was all very awkward.   My blowout was ok. In the middle of my service the stylist just stopped abruptly and said, "I need to go take my medication" and walked away. Uh what? A guy that was at the front desk jumped up to continue while she left and was like, don't worry I'm a stylist. He was really sweet and apologetic (wish he had just finished my blowout).   My stylist was training another person and kept referring to my hair as "frizzy" multiple times, which I found offensive. There are more professional ways to describe my hair type.  My blowout looked good when I left but fell about an hour later. That was disappointing. A good blowout will last me at least 48 hours.  After my service, I went to the bathroom to change into my dress and walked in on one of the stylists (the one my stylist was training) PUKING in the bathroom. Omg, lock the effing door! It was so embarrassing and I felt really bad for walking in on her. I closed the door quickly. When she came out she told me she was really hungover from the night before and it sucks to be puking at work (yeah, for you and me both lady!). Really unprofessional.  Probably will not return given my experiences keep getting progressively worse :/

First time here this evening and overall very pleased with my experience!  Negatives: - icy initial reception by hostess. She was not friendly. - no happy hour food items - I wasn't a fan of their white blend  Positives: - great service. He was friendly, quick, and attentive.  - loved the atmosphere. Warm, cozy, visually appealing - the whole place is beautiful! - FOOD IS AMAZING! We had the bruschetta sampler, smoked tomato bisque with grilled cheese croutons (genius), mixed fries, and pear salad. Everything was beautifully presented and delicious! Fantastic!  We only had time for one glass of wine. I will definitely be back to try more! Great place!

Great selection and the prices are cheaper here than Michael's I've noticed.  But why do I have to wait an eternity to check out of here everytime???  The last time I went there was only one register open and the cashier was just taking his sweet time, no sense of urgency, and didn't call anyone up to assist. There were like 10 people waiting I kid you not and people were quickly losing patience. Finally the poor old woman behind me walked off to find a manager and 3 more cashiers arrived lickety split after she complained.  Customer service and management needs major work but I like the store that aside.

I stopped in today because my sister had a BOGO coupon and insisted we go there since it's so close.  Food quality is standard Quiznos, of which I have never been a fan. Sister appealed to my cheap side and lured me with a coupon.  The BOGO coupon you ask? Yeah, we couldn't use it. That was irritating. The guy gave us some song and dance about how the coupon was fake (despite the fact we had just used coupons from the same book at a McDonald's about 10 mins prior to coming here with no problems). So I don't know what that was about.  He was perfectly nice about it and gave us a free drink and chips for the trouble.  But still...  Don't get the fountain soda! I got a diet Pepsi and it tasted so gross and strange I threw it out.  The store front was clean but the bathroom was nasty - poop on the toilet seat and no soap in the dispenser. EW. I get very concerned when a food establishment does not have a clean bathroom.  No reason for me to return.

Fabulous coffee bar inside QC Olive Mill. I have a lovely experience every time I go. Bill even gave us a mini coffee lesson today. We loved it! Terri is so sweet. Such great customer service.  They know what they are doing. They know their coffee. It really is so rare to see business owners take such pride in their product and business. I'm so appreciative of that as a customer. I would be here every day if I didn't live in Chandler!  I had a cappuccino and husband had a traditional macciato (not on the menu). Both were phenomenal.   My only gripe is that they don't have almond milk. Come on Bill and Terri, no one drinks soy anymore!  Overall, great spot!

Love this Target! Big, clean, New. Friendly employees. They have everything - pharmacy, grocery, STARBUCKS! Yes!   I would stay away around the time the high school across the street gets out (2-4pm). The place is crawling with annoying teenagers everywhere, in the store, the parking lot, parents picking them up etc.   I'm not sure if it's a limited time thing but currently the Starbucks there does this thing called a "treat receipt" where you can bring back the receipt within 14 days and get any drink ANY size for $2. Awesome!

Went here for brunch Sunday morning with my 4 girlfriends. Wow. This place is great! Can't beat the $5 wine! I ordered a glass of the seasonal white blend - to die for! The bruschetta was amazing. My girlfriends ordered some salads and paninis, which were also fantastic. Food quality is impeccable.   Love the laid back hipster atmosphere. We sat on the patio and it was lovely. Our server (Drew) was so cute and had a great personality and really knew how to take care of us persnickety ladies :)  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it took FOREVER for our food to come out. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt since it just opened and they're probably still getting the kinks out. But everything else was 100% perfect. I will definitely return. So happy they are in the east valley!

It's been almost 2 years since my last review and I've been a frequent flyer here. I love it. I actually have overwhelming cravings for the bruschetta sometimes.   They've added a bocce court in the back and everytime I've gone recently there has been live music. And Gilbert being Gilbert, I love how this business has adapted to the community. It's pretty family friendly - as long as your kids are well behaved like mine :p (the kids menu is spot on).  Customer service has had it's ups and downs here for me (except for Scott who usually works at the bar. He is amazing and is always super friendly and very knowledgable about the wines and beers), but the quality of the food and the wine and beer selection are always top notch.  I love it here. And keep coming back over and over, my diet be damned.

This review is for the farm itself. I'm almost nervous to leave a review because I don't want people to know about it and have it become a crowded, expensive disaster like the U pick at the farm out in Queen Creek.  Anyway, the U pick started at 8 am this morning. I wish it opened a little earlier because it was already hot by then. It wasn't bad though because being in the orchard we were covered by lots of shade.  We had such a lovely morning picking fruit. My kids loved it. There were lots of big ripe peaches and nectarines to pick. They smelled so delicious it was difficult not to immediately take a bite!  Not only that, but it wasn't crowded at all. It was very peaceful. I SO appreciated that because we went to a U pick farm out in Queen Creek last week and people were practically fighting each other for peaches. It was horrible. Not here. Not at all.   Very reasonably priced too. We paid $2 a lb. If you fill up a box it's about 11 lbs - $22. Not bad! I've already made a pie and some jam today :)  The guy checking us out informed us that they will be having a U pick for peaches next week, apples in a few weeks and a citrus U pick around Dec/Jan. I can't wait!  They also have a farmers market on Wed and Sat.   I'll definitely be back! Love it!

Great food and beer! And free parking is awesome. I am a little disappointed that you have to pay for every little thing. When I go to a festival, I want to try a little of everything and businesses I've yet to try. Same with the beer. But you can't really do that when everything is $10 each. Vendors didn't offer samples either. Water is $2 except at the DC tent where it's $1.  I was disappointed that you have to pay $10 for the kids area as well. Really? $20 for my 2 kids to jump on some bounce houses? I didn't think it was worth it.  So yeah, it's a nice, big family friendly outdoor event. And we did have fun. But I just think it was an expensive afternoon and I didn't really get to try much.

Decided to check this place out because they had a good deal on GrouponNow.  Very unprofessional and unorganized. Look, just because you are an aesthetician doesn't mean you can run a business. This particular establishment is a prime example.  I bought the GrouponNow which is only valid for a time specified for one day. In this case I had until 6pm to redeem. I tried calling all morning to schedule an appt. No answer.  So I just went down there. Walked in, rang the bell, heard some ladies chatting in the back. After waiting for 15 mins, I finally walked into the back and said HELLO?! Finally the owner came out and said they were closed. Closed? I informed her that she had a GrouponNow running that day. She apologized and offered me a free treatment for my inconvenience. I appreciated that and left.  When I called back to schedule they said they were booked up for the next month! Today, I saw another GrouponNow for them and decided to call and see of they had any openings. This time, at least someone answered the phone! She told me they were booked up the next month. What?  I'm just confused as to why this business keeps running GrouponNow specials that people cannot redeem?  A med spa needs to be staffed and organized before they open their doors. This business is an unprofessional disaster. I hope people check Yelp before buying Groupons to so-called med spas.

Checking out hot new businesses on Yelp and I was thrilled to find this place as it happens to be very close to my home. Read the stellar reviews and was happy to give it a try. So I really (really) hate to be the one give it a less than stellar review...  Stopped in this morning for donuts and coffee. They advertise cappuccino so I was really disappointed to see one of those automatic machines you see in a gas station. Cappuccino was no good obviously.  Speaking of cappuccino, the lady serving me didn't understand that cappuccino is not a flavor. I ordered a hazelnut cappuccino (which I threw away after one sip), and the lady brought out 2 drinks. I said I only wanted the hazelnut and she said I ordered the hazelnut and cappuccino. NO. Cappuccino is not a flavor! Anyway, the miscommunication was a little annoying.  As for the donuts, pretty great. I ordered 1/2 dozen - glazed, sugar, toasted coconut, original, and 2 pink sprinkled (for the kids).  The toasted coconut was PHENOMENAL! I will return just for that donut. The original was hard and stale, and the others were good but not mind blowing. I've had better at Bosa consistently.  Customer service was icy. The cappuccino thing aside, the lady was not friendly or helpful. I was not greeted, she didn't say thanks or have a nice day. Nothing. And seemed annoyed that it was taking me awhile to decide which donuts I wanted (it was my 1st time there!)  Anyway, I'll probably return if I have a craving for that toasted coconut donut, but I'll probably drop my 79 cents on the counter (no tip) and get out. Given the great reviews, I was pretty disappointed with my experience today. Hopefully it was just a fluke.

This is the cleanest McDonald's I have ever been to. Plus they have a huge toddler play area with flat screen tv. It was so nice to sit here and enjoy my coffee and newspaper while the kids played. The play area is just like the mall, but without the filth and crowds. There is a hand sanitizing station and a sign that says to use before and after play. The play structures aren't those disgusting tube slides and ball pits that are impossible to clean. These can actually be cleaned! (See pics). I hope this stays my little secret. Free wi-Fi too! Friendly employees. Food is of the same quality you'd find at your typical McDonald's. I just thought the decor, atmosphere, cleaniness and play area were good enough to Yelp about.

I just had the best brunch of all time...  I knew of Crepe bar food truck so imagine my delight when I was checking out hot new businesses on Yelp and saw they had opened a store front just a few miles from me! So I high-tailed it over there asap.  They did not disappoint! We were greeted as soon as we walked in. Everyone is friendly and enthusiastic. They asked if it was our 1st time in and explained a bit about the menu and how to order etc. We got the custard with berries and the breakfast burrito, a cappuccino and a pomogranate green iced tea.  I was delighted to see the square pay and iPad they use. It's so easy and efficient. And to me a sign of a modern efficient business.  As we were waiting for our food our server chatted with us a bit, she was great with my kids! We just loved her warm friendly personality.   Then our drinks came out. Heaven. My cappuccino was smooth and rich. I saw on the sign they use Ecco coffee...score! One of the best local coffee guys hands down. My husband got the pom green tea which also was delicious.  Our food came out next. It was beautiful. The breakfast burrito was huge. Bold flavors. Just delicious. My kids scarfed down the custard and berries so fast I was lucky I even got a bite. Those crepes were SO good that we went for another! This time we got the "first time" - banana and nutella. Classic and very good. I loved the brulee on top, kind of gave it a roasted marshmellow flavor and texture. Oh my stars it was so good.  While we were stuffing our faces, the owner came over and introduced himself and thanked us for coming in. I LOVE that. Then we had a nice little chat. It was great! We really felt like valued customers and I'm so appreciative of that.  No question, I will be back. A lot. This place is only 1 mile from my kids school. Awesome!

I've been meaning to come in since I had my bday dinner at How do you Roll? Finally made it in with the fam!   I was super excited to try the Japanese cold brew. We had heard awesome things and boy, it did not disappoint! We had a flight of 3 different kinds - lemon jalapeño, med, and ginger cardamom. They were all delicious. The first one you could really taste the lemon, not so much the jalapeño, the med was nice and bold, and the ginger cardamom was my FAV. Nice and spicy.  Note: cold brew has MORE caffeine in it!  For food we got the BMOC and the Pain Perdu. Both were excellent. The pork on the BMOC was nice and moist and smoky. The Portuguese donut was fluffy and not too sweet. Pain Perdu is just SINFUL. Banana bread pudding French toast with whiskey caramel sauce?! Oh you must. You'll gain 5 lbs but you just have to do it.  My only gripe is that both dishes were swimming in sauce. It was too much. My waffle was soggy on the BMOC because it was drowning in syrup. And it whiskey caramel sauce is so rich, they could really just drizzle it on there and it would suffice. Next time I will order the syrup and sauce on the side! I suggest you do the same.  Overall, really good experience. Customer service was warm and friendly. Mostly hipster crowd but there were families there too so we felt totally comfortable as well. Will return!

The outside had me worried a bit but I couldn't be happier with Dr. Phillips!   My poor daughter has been running a high fever and she couldn't get into her ped today. Sun Valley is the closest ped urgent care near us.  I am a bit of a hypochondriac. My kids never get sick so when they do, I tend to think the worst and panic. It doesn't help that I look up symptoms online and think my daughter has meningitis!!!  Dr. Phillips was great. He didn't dismiss my concerns and explained to me how and why my daughter did not have meningitis. He was great with my daughter too. Even managed to get a laugh out of her when she's feeling so miserable. His exam was very thorough and he made sure to answer all of my questions. I didn't feel rushed and he didn't make me feel stupid for thinking my daughter had meningitis. He is wonderful with kids, and wonderful with anxious parents like myself.  Bonus: he is an ER pediatric physician at Banner as well.   Also, we were in and out in 30 mins. No wait. That has NEVER happened to me at an urgent care.  This place is a total gem and will be my place of choice for after hours care for my kids.

I'm from the east coast and LOVE Rita's! Imagine my sheer delight when I stumbled upon this location!  I walked in and the place is clean, colorful, and made me nostalgic for my youth! You can't help but smile. Was greeted warmly by friendly smiling faces :)  I chatted with the owner for a bit and turns out she is from the same area as my family back east! Small world!  They let me pretty much sample everything since I haven't been to a Rita's in a long time. It was awesome. Lots has changed or maybe the west coast chains are different. The cantaloupe has fresh bits of cantaloupe in it. The sugar free mango peach was so good. I was hesitant to try the creme flavors - cheesecake and oatmeal raisin - I didn't like the cheesecake so much, tasted too artificial, but the oatmeal raisin was (surprisingly) delicious!  I was disappointed they didn't have my favorite flavor - Swedish Fish - but they said they rotate flavors and will probably have it in soon.  I'm so happy there is a Rita's so close! What a wonderful surprise today!

I have driven past HC several times over the past year and finally stopped in. I was very impressed! First of all, it is decorated beautifully. Lots of light and very clean. So cheery!   We were greeted warmly and my husband (a self-professed coffee conossieur), starts grilling the poor kid with questions about their coffee, roasting, suppliers, etc. He handled it great! He answered all of our questions.  They get their coffee from Press Coffee (love those guys) and bring it to Maricopa once a week. He let us sample their house Sumatra and it was excellent. Really great customer service.  I also noticed that they know their customers. It seems like they have a lot of regulars which is an excellent sign for a business. In fact, the guy asked if it was our first time in and then proceeded to explain the menu and their offerings. Like I said, great customer service.  Now all this wouldn't even matter if they don't serve great coffee right? Oh but they do! I got a dirty chai with almond coconut milk (bonus points for not having to explain what a dirty chai is, for offering 2 kinds of chai, gold star for having almond coconut milk!). It was heavenly!  Husband got a cappuccino and it was excuted very well (good foam skills back there!) and was tasty.  They thanked us when we left and we were on our way! Great find! I will definitely be back!

I have to agree with Alison T's review. I was pretty disappointed with this place.  First the positives - cute place, clean, friendly service (albeit clueless), $2 plates, $1.99 Kirin pints.  $2 plates consist of 2 small pieces. I don't think it's really a good deal considering how much you need to eat to be satisfied let alone full.  Also, the food was not good. (Eek I just twinged a bit because that sounds really harsh, but it's true). The spicy dumpling soup was inedible. Way too spicy! And I'm saying this as someone who loves even the spiciest of Thai food and the like. And the flavor was gross. Tasted like unfiltered tap water. Ick. I didn't even get to the dumplings.  One roll had cream cheese in it instead of avocado, which it was supposed to have. I also had the Adkins roll, the only rice free, cucumber wrapped roll they had. It just fell apart when I picked it up. In fact, both rolls were just sloppy in execution.  The kids had teriyaki chicken and rice. Chicken smelled bad. They just ate rice and edamame.  I also feel the price point is too high for Chandler. They have their rolls priced at North Scottsdale prices. So irritating. $12 for an Adkins roll? Maybe at Sting Ray at the Biltmore!  $120 for some really mediocre food on a Sunday afternoon? Not happy about it.

I only get my brazilians done here. Seriously, I don't trust anyone else! I love that they use the hard wax instead of strips. So much safer, quicker, and less painful! Also, very reasonably priced. Only about $40 for a Brazilian when you can easily pay $80 for one at a salon! They also offer many different packages, which they always offer to you when you check out. I think it's definitely worth it if you get waxed regularly. I usually don't buy one during the year, but I always get a wax package for the summer when I know I'll be in regularly. Customer service has always been great here too. I'm a fan and recommend this spot to all my friends.

If you want simple breakfast nailed to perfection, with excellent customer service, I highly recommend this place.  As always, I tried to keep my expectations super low because of the hype, but honestly, it deserves the hype!  It was rainy today so we got an unusual late start on the day. Worked in our favor because there was no wait when we arrived (about 1pm).  Everyone there was super nice. Like, genuinely nice. We ordered coffee and the fresh squeezed honey lemonade. The lemonade was delish! They must put a ton of honey in there because you can really taste the flavor. It's so good. The coffee is great too. It's a special blend made especially for Matt's from Cave Creek roasters.   For food we got the special - 3 egg scramble with andouille sausage and fontina cheese. Omg... Now you can imagine how easily it would be to screw up this dish. But it was not greasy, eggs cooked perfectly, and the HASHBROWNS WERE THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD. No seriously, how do they get those hashbrowns so crunchy?!?! The andouille sausage was nice and spicy. Great dish.  It came with a side of sourdough toast and fresh house made strawberry compote. Soooo good and fresh. Compote not too sweet. Great!  The waffle was light and crispy. Bacon was the real deal y'all. Thick. Crispy. And they have REAL maple syrup.  So...they forgot our waffle and we had to remind them of it. No big deal at all to us. But the way they handled it, they comped the waffle and apologized over and over. Over the top customer service. Over the top.  It really doesn't get any better than this for me. Simple food cooked perfectly and great customer service. And the place is adorable too. Will be back for sure!

My husband first tried AZ Food Crafters at one of the Chandler festivals (can't remember if it was the beer or BBQ fest...), he has been raving about them ever since.  It took us awhile to try them because their hours are pretty limited and the location isn't the best. The owner told me they weren't really focused on having a restaurant, but they mostly do farmers markets and orders for pick up. The location is clean and open with a few tables in the front for seating.  The owners are very friendly and hospitable. We had a nice chat about their business and the different hand pies they offer. They make everything from scratch and use fresh ingredients.  We ordered a few of the green chili pork and the chicken marinara pie, as well as the brown butter spiced apple pie. They were all very good. The spiced apple was very heavy on spice, but I like it that way.   I think the price is a little high for what you get ($4 a pie), and they are fairly small, but they are really tasty and fresh. They do offer a 3 for $10 deal so you can save a few bucks there.  Overall, the pies are really good as well as the customer service. I'm a fan!

My favorite boutique in the east valley! I love the fact that this store carries a lot of local designers and is very supportive and involved in the community. The store carries a good selection of items that are affordable but not cheap. Customer service can't be beat. The owner herself spent time with me helping me put together outfits and I thought that was awesome! I always feel like a VIP shopping here! I am definitely a fan and will return. Stop here first before you hit the mall. Support local. You won't be disappointed!

It was PACKED today (spring break) and I felt like they didn't know how to handle the crowd. We waited in line forever to buy tickets, then another line to get tickets scanned and hand stamped, and yet another line to get into the theater. No direction. They should have the lines sectioned off, especially one to bypass the theater and enter the emergence gallery and conservatory faster. I feel this process is really inefficient and slow and definitely could be fixed. So that was frustrating.  The 3D movie was awesome. My kids loved it. I loved it actually :)  The emergence area is small and we were packed like sardines in there. But once we got up to the glass, it was cool to see the butterflies emerging from their cocoons.  Next was the conservatory. This is beautiful! It's just so magical having all these colorful butterflies flying all around. It's enchanting. Note - it is really humid in there and my 4 yr old freaked out and I had to take him out for fresh air and water. Keep that in mind with your little ones.  The snack bar/cafe is really expensive. I recommend bringing your own snacks and water.  They have a small section with bugs (we saw honey bees, a scorpion, a tarantula, and ants), and some aquariums and a small sting ray tank in the middle. I wasn't impressed given the cost of admission. The sting rays are tiny and you can barely pet them.  Overall, the crowds made the experience pretty unpleasant, and BW hopefully will work on handling crowds better. In the future I know not to come during high peak (weekends that's a given, but also school breaks).  I think the admission price is too high as well. Not a lot of interactive exhibits and only one movie. I don't think an annual membership is worth it for those reasons (and with 2 kids, I typically spring for the memberships - zoo, science center, children's museum), but I don't think we will be coming back for awhile.

I have been wanting to go here since I first got wind of this place and FINALLY made it today!   I am not familiar with Creole style food and one of the owners (I think) was happy to give me the low down. She even offered to make me a new coffee if I didn't like the chicory flavor, since it was my first time having. Awesome customer service! I also can't have dairy so I asked what their non-dairy options are. They just had soy. So of you've been reading my reviews, you know I get peeved when a local coffee shop doesn't have almond milk. So I decided to suggest they offer it, and the owner said he would from now on! So those of you almond milk lovers can thank yours truly for French Grocery carrying almond milk :)  Anyway, we ordered macaroons (I liked the green one the best, I think it was pistachio rosemary). They were perfect! Soft, chewy, not too sweet, bold flavor. The beignets were hot and fresh covered in powdered sugar, OMG to die for. And the praline bacon. Just sinful. I wish they would serve those hot out of the pan though. The one we got had been sitting out for a few minutes and cooled down and got kind of limp. They were so delicious. I'm a huge fan of sweet and salty mixed.  Unfortunately, they were sold out of croissants by 10am! I'm coming back during the week for those. Diet be damned.  We also got a French press and cafe au lait with chicory. I really really liked the chicory flavor! It's hard to explain. They use Cortez Coffee which I was thrilled to hear about because we know Ron Cortez and his coffee is superb.  Since they are brand new I figure there are kinks to be worked out. It was kinda hectic and disorganized at the counter. I think they are still finding their groove. I think they need to open earlier and definitely need to be open on Sundays. Parking is also a pain. But, their food and coffee is high quality and delicious. They will have lines out the door by the year's end.  Can't wait to come back. Seriously, I can't get that green macaroon and cafe au lait with chicory out of my mind. And the beignets...and French press...and praline bacon...

I really like it. Service was outstanding. Simple menu. Sleek and stylish decor. It's a beautiful addition to downtown Mesa. ER has so much potential! I had a lovely chat with the owner, Edmundo, who told us about his family, him being from Mexico and his wife from Costa Rica. The beautiful mural on the wall represents his family. It's awesome! You can tell there is a lot of love and passion behind this business. I also liked the fact that the owner was so friendly and open to suggestions and feedback.  I was so very excited for ER to open since I lived in Chile for a year and ate empanadas nearly everyday. We ordered the El Capitan (it sounded the closest to the traditional Chilean empanadas I loved), and the Cubana. Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed by the El Capitan. It wasn't bad, just not what I was expecting I guess. Cubana was very good.   They also had a really good lunch special. It was $7.50 for 2 empanadas, a side of beans, rice, and salad.(I think). Excited for them to get their liquor license and start offering local craft beers!  I think ER has a lot of potential. Will be back to try the rest of the menu.

So I've been here twice already and it's only been open for a week! Hubby and I attended the grand opening and literally couldn't stop talking about the beers and burgers all week.  It's pretty much seat yourself from what I can tell. But they manage to notice us and get to us quickly. Customer service is super friendly and attentive.  Opening night we ordered the 70/30 brisket burger and it came with home fries. This time it came with rosemary chips. Real cut potatoes. They were excellent! Both times the burgers have been cooked perfectly. Soft and juicy and a little pink...SO good. We have no problem ditching our plant based diet for THIS burger.   So this is a brewery so it's really about the beer right? I'm not a beer expert or hardly even a beer drinker honestly, and the BWBW made me wish I had bought a growler so I could drink it every night. It's probably the best wheat beer ever. They had a few ales and IPAs that were quite good as well.  They said next week they will have their Superstition Coffee stout ready!!! Omg...I'm definitely bringing my growler for that. I love Superstition Coffee (no really read my review).  Yeah, I'll be back :) Well done!

I've had this bookmarked for awhile...I should have come in sooner! It's great!  We came in today for Father's Day (found out about the free pie for Dad's today gave us a perfect reason to check it out).  When we walked up, they were slammed. But it was not a problem! They are really organized and the line moved super fast. I'm actually shocked at how fast our pizzas came out considering it was so crowded when we went today.   The pizza is fantastic! We ordered the pesto chicken, Italian meat lovers, pepperoni/olives/mushrooms, and a plain cheese for the kids. All the pizzas are $7.75 and just a plain cheese and sauce is $6. Great value for an 11in pizza! Oh and a pizza cookie ya know, since it was a special occasion.  Such a great concept and very well executed. I'm totally coming back to try their salads.

Ok. I really want to like this place. The atmosphere is gorgeous. And I keep going back because hubby digs the happy hour - a great deal with $5 pizza and discounted beer. I've been here I think 5 times already at least. But the slow service and poor management/operations keep me from being a fan.   With the exception of the green chili pork pizza, the food isn't that great either. Actually, I've had the strawberry salad which was good, but overpriced for the portion size. The margarita pizza was terrible. They use pesto sauce and not fresh basil and it was soggy. Not a fan of the bruschetta (weird combo of flavors that don't work).   And my last visit, I ordered a burger wrapped in lettuce. They don't have lettuce, just salad greens. So my burger comes out totally cold, on top of a bed of wilted spring mix. Not appetizing at all! So I sent it back and told the server it was cold. He brings it back, and it's burned to a crisp!  I was like seriously? Why would you even serve that to me? I sent it back again and just requested they take it off the bill. Which they did without any hassle.  The pizza takes for.ev.er.  I've been meaning to ask the owner if they only have one small pizza oven back there because the wait time is unreasonable. Like 40 mins for a small pizza has been the consistent wait time. It's frustrating.   I really hope they can turn things around. I have a relative in the restaurant biz and understand it's exceedingly difficult, especially when you have owners new to the industry. So I try to be patient with new places (hence me not writing this review until after I've been 5+ times). But at this point, they should have things running a little more smoothly and they are not improving.   2 stars for atmosphere and for service and management always being gracious and willing to fix their screw ups (which happen a lot).

Gosh I hate to be the one to do this but, this was not even near 5 star caliber to me (especially comparing to other cafés in the area like Lux).  I had some errands to run in Cen Pho and I really didn't want to totally derail my diet for lunch. So I did a yelp search for salads and this popped up. Imagine my delight to find all raving reviews! I headed over immediately.  I love the atmosphere. It's really cute and cozy, but a little industrial too with the concrete floors and counters. Love, love the teal chairs, white brick walls and fresh flowers.  Anyway, the service, while nice, was pretty aloof. And it wasn't busy so I don't know what the deal was. Perhaps they were busy making call in lunch orders that I was ignored?  I got a small spinach salad. For $4 I felt the portion was fair. However, my salad was supposed to come with Pomagranate and it didn't have it on there. I initially wanted to try the soup but they had run out (by noon?).  I got a Belgian waffle for my son. My salad came out (which took awhile), I finished it and we were still waiting on the waffle. I was trying to catch the eye of one of the employees because my son was really hungry, and he's 4 so he was about to go postal.  Finally a young girl asked of there was anything else, and I reminded her of the waffle and cookie we ordered. Her response was oh sorry that wasn't on the ticket (she was being polite not snarky - never know how that might come across in a review). But she was the one who took my order so I was confused as to how those items were left off the ticket.  Anyway, the waffle and cookie finally came out. They were really good. In fact, the food is really good and fresh. No doubt about that.  But my overall experience was just weird. In fact on the way out, a gentleman asked how was everything and I was like ok, food was good but it took a long time and the Pomagranate was left off my salad. His response, were there pomagranates supposed to be on your salad? I was like yeah all the ingredients of the salad are right here on the menu. He just shrugged his shoulders and said yeah it happens sometimes. He wasn't rude, but dismissive. Didn't apologize or anything.  As I walked out, one of the ladies was rolling out dough to make cinnamon rolls. They are probably delicious.   They seem like super nice people who serve good food. But they could use improvement on the customer service and efficiency.

I concur with everyone else...  I understand that this is the first year of this event so I wasn't expecting things to run 100% perfect. But it was pretty bad start to finish.  Parking, indeed was a nightmare. After  waiting in line forever to get into the lot, we finally bailed and turned around and parked at the lot by Tempe Town Lake about 1/2 mile away, and just walked to the arts center.  We finally get to the arts center and see a huge line.  My sister still needed to buy a ticket but we didn't know where to go. Random people passing out wristbands, people just standing around not knowing where to go. It was total chaos.  Once we get into the event, you have to wait in line after line forever. In the 3 hours we were there, I only got to try a fish taco from Rubios, a small square of pizza from Mellow mushroom, which took extra long because they had run out of pizza. Tomato soup from Lodge but they ran out of the grilled cheese that was supposed to accompany it.   Drinks I only had a sample of (not so great) wine and a beer (they were pretty stingy with the beer pour and my husband made a comment about that). There were a lot of options at the event, but the length of the lines combined with the short event time, made it virtually impossible to try even a fraction of what was there. I didn't even get to see any of the demonstrations or entertainment because 99% of my time was spent in line. No way in hell you are getting your money's worth.  It was particularly hot today and there was no water to be found anywhere. It's not really foreseeable that it would be close to 80 degrees in Feb, but you do have people drinking alcohol  in the sun all afternoon. Water should have been readily available.  I don't get how this event was so poorly executed? It's a ticketed event so they knew exactly how many people would be in attendance.

This review is just for the aquatic center. Med sized city pool with a large splash pad, water slide, whirlpool and lazy river. Also a couple diving boards. It's brand new so the facility is very nice.  Today is the grand opening and it's not even that crowded so that's nice. It'll probably be a mad house during the summer as it's not very big.  It's free with a rec center pass which is likely a vastly better deal than a day pass. Day passes are overpriced compared to other city pools, at $4 adults, $2 kids. That's double the price you'll pay at any other city pools.  You can rent swim vests for your little ones.  Fyi...there's practically NO shade. Not that many seats either. There's a small area in the middle with shade and seating, then you have to take refuge on the perimeter of the building. Bring your own umbrella and seat.

I found a Living Social deal for this company. A really good deal $65 for 4 hours of cleaning. My appointment was very easy to book online, however, they didn't have anything available for about 2 weeks. So expect a wait for your initial appointment.  Today was my appt with Celina T. She arrived 10 mins early, was very friendly and professional. She asked me if there were any areas she should focus on which I appreciated a lot since she was only there a few hours.   I came home from work and was very pleased! Everything I said to focus on was done and she even washed a load of towels for me (she asked permission first). I have a lot of loose items laying around randomly and Celina was very respectful of my things. I have decided to book her for bi-weekly cleanings. I highly recommend her.
