480termites to conduct termites inspection on a transaction I had in escrow,  they came back saying  property also had bed bugs, we hired them to treat for bed bugs, they treated a  total of 6 times, after nearly spending $1000, we decided to hire Burns to do heat treatment for the bed bugs, which 480termites don't offer, probably due to lack of experience, we were told immediately by Burns that we didn't have bed bugs and the dead bugs were just dog dog fleas! After spending all the money on the wrong treatment and loosing 2 buyers, I called 480termites to let them know I get the manger who didn't care and didn't wanna hear it and hands the phone back to receptionist!

Not the same! I was a huge fan of the Scottsdale restaurant, I took my boyfriend to the tempe location and was a huge disappointed! Not the same,  food quality was horrible, different chef than the old scottsdale location. Not worth it.  save ur money! I used livingsocial and still wasn't worth it.

I ordered the chicken shawarma sandwich and the lamp shanks with hummus, my pita was burnt, dry old cooked chicken and it came with "Greek salad" nothing Greek about it, no feta and awful dressing, my hummus was tasteless and the lamp shank was very small what they charge for it.. Won't be back!
