This is my favorite place to get black out drunk.  Always close enough to uber home. always strong drinks and interesting people.

Very sweet people lots of product.  Doesn't seem like the cleanest of places and my nails are lifting already. After four days. Rather upsetting because they are soooo cute.  Went another time because I had always had luck in the past.  My nails lifted within a day, I went back three times to have them corrected- on the fourth trip decided I would not be coming back.

I love this place.  Their ceviche isn't as good as it was 3 years back.  I am not really sure why as my talents rest in more in eating than cooking. They also have an amazing lemonade and Rosemary drink that i have drunken dreams about.

I have been coming here for years and it is always horrible customer service (i swear it gets worse every time). Last time some little punk kid with plugs yelled at me for being 5 minutes late for my reservation even though i called ahead of time to let them know.  However.. you end up just allowing it because the price is awesome and so is the sushi.  The wait staff is horrible.  They are horrible when you order drinks they are rude when they drop off your check... but ... I'm still coming back for the cheap sushi that so far hasn't made me violently sick.

Really disappointed.  I was very excited to come here and was ignored for twenty minutes before I walked out.  We even had a conversation with the owner who i had met before at a foodie event about how I was waiting for a menu and some water.  She went into the back for a couple of minutes... then came out to serve someone else.  I must not have looked very friendly at that point.

This place was cool.  Its huge has great bartenders and good live music.  Definitely want to spend more time here. its just far enough away from "mill" to be tolerable.

Everyone is super friendly.  The food is awesome and the green salsa satisfies my cravings for spicy without making me cry like the wimp i am. I will definitely be back

I went in for a estimate on a botched front end job from another company.  I was needing to get my car re repaired because it was a lease and i was terrified at what the leasing company might charge me. There was other damage on the car.  Some wear and tear and some new damage from someone who had hit my car on the passenger side and i didn't realize it until that day.  The reason for my rating is this:  I felt the entire time like the girl up front was super shady because i asked her to look at one thing and give me an estimate.  She proceeded to inspect my entire car and tell me that i needed 95% of it repainted or she was sure the lease company would charge me for it.  I told her that is not an option lets just look at the front.. My estimate came out to $2000 and i might have believed that if one of the things in the quote wasn't buying an entire new Chevy cross in the front instead of just replacing the broken clip under it. I felt like i was dealing with a shady car salesman.   I ended up returning the car with all the existing damage.  The leasing company (who's obviously out to make money as well) charged me a total of $400 for the front end bumper damage and hood.    While i will never get the hour i drove out of my way to show up at this shop back.. I'm glad i didn't spend more than 5x the amount it actually cost to fix this with Carworks.
