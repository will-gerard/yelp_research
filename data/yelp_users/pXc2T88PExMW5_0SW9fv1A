The coffee and my sandwich were alright--it was the experience that really left me with a bad taste in my mouth.  I stopped in on a Sunday afteroon, wanting a bite to eat and an iced coffee. There was no sign of food on the main menu, and when I asked if they had any, the guy at the register pointed to a stack of papers. I looked and saw they were a circle-what-you-want type thing, so I did that. Then he proceeded to tell me they were out of turkey as well as pepperjack. Ok, sub ham for turkey and jack for pepperjack. Then he tells me they're out of iced coffee....now sure how, but fine...I picked something else. As my credit card was running he made an exasperated noise and told me they were out of pretzel buns too. Honestly, I was at my wits end at this point, but since my card already run and I was starving, I just rolled with it and told him to put it on sourdough. The other guy behind the counter was apologetic, saying they get their shipments on Mondays and that was why they were out of so many things.   I had asked the guy who rang me up for the wifi password and I sat down and attempted to connect to the wifi. There was no network with their name, so I chose the strongest signal, but it wasn't theirs. When the guy who took my order brought out my sandwich I asked which network it was. He told me (and it was not anything obvious) with a tone like I was a total moron and I was putting him out for asking. Then, at 1:30 he walked up to me and said "I just wanted to tell you that we close at 2:00 sharp." I could already tell because they were bringing in the outside furniture, plus I had checked with the nicer of the two employees not two minutes before that, but thank you for the rude reminder.  It's really a shame that I had such an awful experience, because I'm signing a lease at a place really close to here. I'd love to have a local coffee shop I feel comfortable stopping by or working in, but this one certainly isn't it.

I'm a huge fan of Via Delosantos, and not only because it's about a 5 minute walk from my house. Their house margaritas are only $3. Are they the best margaritas you'll ever have? Probably not. They're a little sweet and made with a mix. But will they get you drunk? You're damn right they will. And for the price, you really can't beat that. They make it easy for you if you want to turn any of their 50+ nicer tequilas into a margarita: just add $2 to the shot price.   As for the food, I've never been disappointed. Some things are better than others though. Their Pollo Fundido is truly the best in town. I've never had a better tamale, and they have red and green sauces. I believe the red is vegetarian friendly, so when I had my veggie friend visiting, she was happy to have an authentic tamale to try. My husband and I mixed it up last time we went and split the Super Mexican Pizza, which was surprisingly good. It was on a huge tortilla and had machaca beef, tomatoes, green onions and black olives. Ask for a side of sour cream and you'll be in heaven. One mexican pizza, a margartia, a Dos Equis and tip= $25. Not bad for a night out for two, and we even had a few pieces leftover. Personally, I didn't care for their guacamole. It just seemed like mashed up avocado to me, no especially interesting additions, so that's the one thing I'd steer clear of.   I don't personally know what "real" Mexican food is...I've never been to Mexico. All I know is my husband and I have been told by several people from Mexico that we're lucky to live by one of the best authentic places in Phoenix. So take that as you will.  The place is a little run down, but to me that's part of the charm. I love sitting in the little back room, it has a more personal feel. They get pretty busy around dinnertime on the weekends, but the wait never seems to be more than 10-15 minutes. Fair warning: They close at 9:30, even on Saturdays, which is pretty annoying. I thought the hours listed here couldn't possibly be right, but I called and confirmed.

It's been said before, but I'll say it again: Cibo is pretty freakin' awesome. The pizzas are unique, but well-balanced. The toppings are well thought out...they're not throwing a bunch of strange stuff on a pizza just because they can; the flavors really meld well. The crust is chewy but not difficult to eat. My pizza was a tad overdone on the bottom, but it was easily overlooked. They have a good wine selection but I was looking for a local brew since I just moved here and they didn't disappoint there, either. Service was a little slow but super friendly. The patio is absolutely lovely and the funny slumped over tree with twinkling lights is a nice touch.

Delicious food. Fast Service. Polite employees. Clean environment. It doesn't get any better than this in the fast food world.

This is a place you want to take visiting friends. It looks like a hole in the wall in a sad strip mall, but it doesn't let you down. The burgers themselves aren't super special, but the topping combos are killer. The Santa Fe burger, with a whole fried green chile on top, is a sight to be seen. The fries are surprisingly delicious and have the skins still intact. They remind me of the fries at Five Guys, which I think is a really good thing. Last time we went I decided to try the subs, and I would heartily recommend you do the same. I was feeling something a little more traditional, so I tried their Reuben. The sauerkraut wasn't too overwhelming, the dressing was perfect, and there was a ton of melted cheese. Mmm. I will warn you though: Whatever you get is going to require a LOT of napkins, and possibly a knife and fork. This isn't a place to take a dainty eater.  Their selection of pop (yeah, I said pop) is insane. All of them are priced the same. No stressing out over picking one out before ordering and wondering how much each costs. And after you're done eating, go next door to the pop-only storefront and pick up a 4 or 6 pack to go. I asked the owner how many different varieties he has, and he said right now it's 700+, so the choice won't be easy, but you'll come away with some interesting varieties. I picked up a rhubarb soda, and a espresso soda last time, along with the key lime one I had with my meal.

Since moving nearby I'd been scouting this place, and it seemed to be a little hole-in-the wall gem. We finally tried it this week and it was exactly that!  We walked in and received a cold greeting from the guy at the counter. He seemed a little bothered that we were there, but took our order. Two gyros with a side of hummus. It took a little bit to get the food, but as he was the only person working, I didn't mind. The price was reasonable. We hung out in the sparse interior until it was ready, then headed home to chow down.  The meat itself was hot and delicious; not at all dry like gyro meat can sometimes be. There wasn't an overpowering amount of onions, which I liked. (I hate feeling like I have dragon breath for hours and hours after enjoying a Greek feast.) I usually like an obscene amount of tzatziki sauce and this gyro was lacking in it. But the more I ate, the more I found myself enjoying the tasty pita and meat flavors instead...but I'm not a total convert: next time I'll order some on the side for dipping's sake. The hummus was really tangy and had a few veggies hanging out on top, most notably a kalamata olive, which I grabbed before my husband even had a chance. Yum.

To be honest, I wasn't expecting much. I just moved here from Memphis, a city known for its BBQ. Seriously, there are over 100 BBQ joints in the city limits and it's a much smaller city than Phoenix...they're not messing around. But Waldo's is close to my house and had decent reviews, so I figured why not. I'll give it a try for a Sunday night meal, but I didn't think I'd be that impressed.  I'm not too proud to admit when I'm wrong. So here goes: I was wrong.  The menu is simple and small, which made ordering a breeze. My husband and I split a brisket sandwich and hot fries and ordered a side of mac n cheese too. I like that they offer the sandwiches "Memphis Style" as well, AKA with slaw on top. They're not lying--most places in Memphis make their sandwiches with slaw, but my belly isn't cut out for cabbage, so we didn't try theirs. The brisket itself was chopped and had tons of flavor. I didn't put the sauce on the sandwich because it didn't need it on every bite, but when I dipped it, the sauce proved to be as good as the brisket. It was spicy but not too intense for most. The hot fries on the other hand..man, those suckers got really spicy after a while. They seemed to have cayenne or something sprinkled on them and were really tasty dipped in the ranch that they provided. The mac n cheese was really creamy, not that gross hardened cheese, stuck together stuff you find at some other places.  Over all I was really pleased. I love the round prices: our was $7 even. The only thing was bugged me was that I couldn't find the menu for this location online, only the larger location in  Mesa. They have a more extensive menu, so I arrived hoping they had fried okra, which they didn't. I'd love a menu for their location on their website to avoid confusion, but it's a minor annoyance for such tasty, affordable BBQ.

Welp, I've found my favorite local place.  From the decor to the food, everything about Most Wanted is top-notch. I met a friend here for lunch on a Sunday. There was a steady amount of people coming in and out, but the service certainly didn't suffer. Since it was our first time in, we were offered samples of all of the different meats...which made it incredibly hard to choose, as there wasn't a bad one in the bunch. But there's no guessing as to which you will like...you'll know! The people who came in after us had been in before, but asked to sample a few anyhow, and they seemed happy to oblige. I ended up getting 3 large tacos: Creamed (chicken), Cochinita Pibil (pork), and Barbacoa (beef). All of the meats were incredibly flavorful. We shared a basket of chips and guac which was tasty too. There's also a salsa bar with 3 different heat levels available, plus all the limes and jalapenos you could want. My advice? Skip the fountain drinks and peruse the cooler of bottled varieties by the door...you can't go wrong with the legendary Mexican Coke.  Finally: the decor. I was in love from the moment I walked in. I love bright (some would say tacky, but whatever) walls and glitter. Add in some badass Lucha Libre portraits and masked heroes flying from the walls and you have Most Wanted's vibe. Basically, it's a delicious heaven for me.

If this if the caliber of goodness they're bringing after only being open two months, then I'd say Northern Perks has a bright future ahead.  My husband and I stopped in on a Sunday morning. We were the only customers inside at the time, but there was an older couple enjoying their purchase on a patio table out front. The woman working (owner I assume) was super friendly and helpful. She just lit up the room and you could tell she loved being there.   The doughnuts were really top notch. The plain glazed would be almost indiscernible from Krispy Kreme's in a side by side taste test, and to me, that's a heavenly thing. The glaze was light and flaky--never too thick or (eww) damp like it sometimes gets. The cronut (my first, I'm behind the times) was tasty and crisp but the filling it had was a little bland. I'd like to see it done with a more interesting flavor. The lemon-filled doughnut was nice and tart--just what I look for, but if you prefer a sweeter lemon, it might not be for you. The boston cream doughnut was just that, cream-filled, not filled with a glorified pudding like some places offer. The ham, cheese, and jalapeno croissant was to die for. If you like spicy breakfast foods, that is, 'cause this thing was not messing around. I think it was my husband's favorite part of the trip, and that's really saying something, as he is a doughnut FANATIC. (He remembers the first time he ever tried one as a child. No lie.) I also got an iced Cafe du Monde coffee, and although it was prepared a little differently than I had in good ol' NOLA, it was outstanding. The chicory in the coffee is what really makes it stand out.  Do yourself a favor and stop in--you won't regret it!

Incredible pizza. Ultra friendly service. A warm, inviting environment.   If you only read that far, it pretty much covers my experience at Base. We stopped in on a busy Friday night but were greeted promptly and with gusto from one of the owners who was also our server. We started out with the flatbread and house made dips. The two dips were perfectly portioned for the 8 slices of flatbread. I'm not sure what they were...besides really tasty. (The owner was incredibly busy, but I have no doubt he would have answered any questions that we had about the dish. We're just love trying new things, so we just went with it!)  The wines were written on a chalkboard on the wall. It seemed like they had a good selection, with glasses starting at $5. But we both prefer beer, so we ordered a few glasses. They were nice and cold, if slightly smaller than I would have liked for $6 a piece.  We chose the El Diablo to share. The pizza itself was a thing of beauty. A wood fired pizza can be a disaster if done incorrectly, but they certainly know what they're doing. The crust was crispy but not overly so, and spotted but not burnt. All of the ingredients were of the highest quality, which reflected in the incredible flavors. The tomato sauce was simple and fresh.  It was topped with soppressata, kalamata olives, and peppers. It was slightly spicy but might be more intense for those who aren't acclimated to spicy dishes.  It was a little more than I spend on an average Friday pizza night, but the quality is so good that I can see myself coming back for sure. Plus, Tuesday nights they have half price pizzas. In other words, I think I've found a new night to go out for pizza!
