I wish there were stars for service and food separately because I hate to give 2 stars to a place I like, but the service today was just...ugh.  First off, I like Zoe's. It's not the greatest food ever but they use a lot of feta and I love feta. I am not a fan of the overdesigned feel of the restaurant, but whatever.  Today, I departed from my normal and had a different sandwich. I asked the girl at the register nicely if it could not be too heavily toasted because I've had some turkey sandwiches nearly blackened to where the bread was useless. She not only proceeded to do a subtle half-eye roll, but she was outright unpleasant. I've never seen her there before and this surprised me because usually the people up front are really nice.   Will I go back? Yes. But I'll make sure to not go to her if there is someone else available or just order it on the phone so that way if she does answer, I can't see her roll her eyes at me.   Oh, and they didn't burn my sandwich alright. Actually (if I could take a picture I would) they barely heated it. The cheese is still mostly intact.

Oh, Athenian Express. You were so promising, alluring, and tempting when I walked in the door and yet, so disappointing.  The bad: - Awful gyro meat. This tastes like the gyro meat at Crave sandwiches, which we all know isn't real gyro meat.  - THREE slices of gyro meat. THREE. I took a picture to prove that it literally only came with three slices. Whichever reviewer said that their sandwiches were bigger than a Kronos lied and lied mercilessly. Seriously, who gives three slices of meat? - The sauce was mediocre. It's homemade, but that doesn't mean it has to be mediocre.  - Fries aren't anything special. They taste like fries that come in a bag, no special seasoning or anything.  - Cubs fans. Enough said.   The good: - I ordered fries, which I got, but they also gave me fruit. I don't know why, but this saved the review from being one star because the fruit salad had mango AND orange in addition to melons and strawberries. - Fast service. Damn fast. Maybe too fast since they gave me so little meat.  Overall: I was so excited to go here because I only get gyros on a special occasion. Well hot damn, I won't go back. I'm going to stick to George's Famous Gyros on McKellips in Tempe where not only are they not Cubs fans but they use real gyro meat.

Honestly, this place is really great. As usual, I'll do my good and bad points.  Good/great/amazing - The service here is top-notch. If you've ever been somewhere where they don't pay attention to you, this is the opposite. Every ten minutes someone was asking me if I wanted something to drink (such as wine), a hand massage, or something to read. At one point my stylist even offered to get me something from AJ's because I mentioned I was hungry. - Hair/facial I went here to get a haircut, highlights, and a facial. The facial took nearly an hour and she really went to town on my face. Liz, the one who worked on my face, knew my problem areas even before I mentioned them. For the frugal yelpers out there (I'm one of them) there isn't too much pressure to get any of the products they use. At least, it's not annoying enough for you to say "Ugh, stop!" but just enough to get you to think. I did get one of the recommended face products and it really does work (even on my more oily than texas skin).  My stylist was a nice lady whose name begins with the eighth letter of the alphabet (should you want to go to her). When I got there, my hair was two-toned and very boring without any style. I spoke to her about what I wanted and nearly three hours later (and one other visit to add a few more highlights) she had turned my sad sally hair into something that I actually want to comb and style everyday. I will go back to her as often as I can mostly because my hair finally looks great.  The not so great: Pricey? Yes. If you're a poor grad student like me, it will be expensive.   Overall: This salon is great. It is a bit pricey so I can't go back every six weeks since that would require cutting my grocery budget and/or driving. Service is amazing, they really pay attention to you, and they will leave you with great hair. My stylist really was wonderful.   Bonus: I forgot their 100% guarantee. If you're even remotely not happy, as in, 90% happy but you really want your bangs a quarter inch shorter or one more highlight, they will do it. For free.

No, I simply cannot put in a good review for Miracle Mile.  A coworker recommended this place to me. Actually, two coworkers did. However, upon inspection of my pie right before I was about to eat it, I noticed that there was mold in it.  Yes, mold.  Sorry Miracle Mile, your fries were bland and while your chicken tenders were decent, I can't forgive mold in a pie. I did take a picture of it so I will be adding it to this review as soon as I can.  Who knows if I will get my 2.95 for moldy pie back.  *ETA MM has been notified and I am to receive a gift certificate for my 2.95. I was given the option of returning it but it's over a 40 min drive.

Simply put, these guys were great.  If you never look around, you'll never find honest, small businesses like these.  While the initial appearance may put most off (it's not exactly Safelite but don't let looks fool you) it honestly is worth going here.   The guys here were super polite, friendly, quick in service and VERY fairly priced. They won't come to you, but you'll be in and out in under a half hour.   When this plastic strip thing didn't stick entirely because of the rain, I drove back and they fixed it for free.   I'll be recommending friends and while I hope I ever need to replace my windshield, I'll definitely come back if need be.

Apparently, you really do get what you pay for. My mother and I went to get our nails done for a night out. While hers came out perfectly fine, the man who did my nails probably didn't care about hygiene. Or safety. Or being professional or courteous.   First, he started scraping my cuticles with his own nails. I let that go since it's happened to me in Mexico but I don't like it when it happens. However, the final straw was when he cut me- twice. On two separate fingers. Not even a little cut, which would be acceptable, but one was bleeding enough that the little bowl of water that you put your hand in was colored red. I jerked my hand away so that he could see what he did but all he muttered was a "tsk tsk" and kept going. Instead of listening to my gut instinct and saying "you know, I don't want the manicure anymore" I just stuck it out.   I really wanted to like this place since it is so cheap ($8 for a manicure!!) but I will not go back. If the lady had done my nails then it would be a different story.   I would file a complaint with the AZ cosmetology board, not because I am one of those who complain, but because this really was a bad cut. However, you need before and after photos and I do not have those since I don't expect to get my cuticles ripped out when I go get a manicure.

No. No. No. I've had it with this place. I gave it several tries, I even tried to convince myself that it wasn't THAT bad, but it is!  - The sushi is TOO small. Really? It looks like a child's version of sushi. My god, it would take eight rolls to fill me.  For the same price, I'll keep going to the one restaurant at tempe martkeplace. I'll take pretentiousness and overdone japanese furniture over crappy sushi anyday.   Sigh. I wanted to like you, Sushi 101. But you're like that boy I dumped in the 10th grade who talked a lot of talk but ended up being a total bore.

I've been trying out different sushi places around my house and I've finally found one where I'll be proud to be a "regular".   While it's no RA or Kabuki, it definitely has  its perks.  1) No long waits 2) No annoying tourists (although writing this review may bring more in but I'll settle) 3) Great sushi 4) Nice chef on M, Th and Fridays.   Their happy hour is only from 5-7 but it is from Mon- Fri. Most places only do M- Th. There are a good 15 or so rolls that are half off during HH and plenty of daily specials.   This place is only 6 minutes from me and it's right down the street from where I take the express bus back home from work.   Now, if you're expecting smooth, suave and hip from Crazy Fish, don't come here. If you prefer RA or some other chain-sushi place, don't come here. If you want a nice waitress who is friendly, a chef who talks to you and is pleasant, and a quiet place to eat, CF is for you.  Since I prefer dim lighting to red lights and no waiting in line, I'm going to come here repeatedly.

I'm commenting on the beauty parlor here. As someone who breaks out from the wax they use on my eyebrows, I love threading.   If you can take the (slight) pain, go to India Plaza to get your eyebrows done. It's about $8.45 with tax, takes about 10 minutes, and you leave happy. They're open on weekends and it seems they might even be open pretty late.   Definitely going to make this my regular eyebrow place.

Great specials: 2 slices and a drink for $3.50 It's not the greatest pizza ever (for that, go to Pete's # 2 in Chicago), but it beats anything from Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa John's, etc.   The portions are big, the pizza is not too ridiculously greasy, and the people are friendly without being fake. Delivery is also quick!   ETA: I'm giving them a full five stars because they are so friendly and have great service. They charged me twice for a pizza, so I went in and they gave me the cash right then and there. They weren't even snotty about it!

I'm surprised at myself for giving out so many 5 star reviews in the past two months but this place really deserves it.  It is day 4 of my french manicure and honest to god, swear on my grandmother's grave, there is not one single chip! None! I actually forced my own nail chip just to see what it would take because I was starting to worry!  The good:  Quick, cheap, effective. The decor is nicer than your usual 10 dl manicure place. While my nail lady didn't speak very much to me (I'm a quiet person so that's fine with me) there are other chattier ladies.   They're open till 7:30 but they actually let me come in as they were closing because they knew why I needed the manicure (job interview the next day). Not only that, but they didn't skip on being nice.   There we were, 7:25, and she proceeds to do a full on french manicure for nearly 40 minutes.   Polish- good selection. OPI and they use the new gel stuff from OPI which is why I think my nails haven't chipped.   the bad: Umm...parking? It's at tempe marketplace so you might not get a spot right in front but it is not hard.   This IS my new spot for nails. I may start going every two weeks since it's so affordable and apparently my nail polish is lasting me much, much longer than a normal one.

te encontre!  I've been reading yelp reviews of this for a good two weeks and was dying to go here.  After a long day of not eating, I forced myself to go here. It's completely out of my way but boy was it worth it.  I ordered two things: Carne asada tacos combo plate and a Tinga quesadilla.  The fact that they have tinga makes me very happy. It wasn't as "tingaish" as I would have liked it, but then again, no one has ever made me tinga like my Tia guty.   The bad: - teeny tiny parking. I came here at 4pm on a friday and was the only person there for a good ten minutes. I can't imagine finding a parking spot when there are more people around.  - The tortillas weren't great. They're not bad, but they aren't anything special. A taco should have a good tortilla in case the meat sucks (not that it sucked here). - The rice and beans portion is small. WAY small. I get that a restaurant needs to make some profit, but these are tiny.   The good-  - The quesadilla is huge. By huge, I mean I ate half of it and had to save some for later because of how filling the doughy tortilla is. This is not your average quesadilla. Not only do they use the right cheese (not your Americanized mozzarella and monterey jack or even, god forbid, chihuahua cheese), but the tortilla is flaky AND flavorful. That's a quality tortilla. This tortilla is nothing like the one used for the tacos, you can tell they make these themselves.  -The variety of salsas is pretty damn good. They will have everything from the most unoffensively bland salsa for gueros to a chile de arbol salsa that could make my daddy sweat.   - La horchata. Now this is what horchata should taste like. Other restaurants take note because people may come here solely for this. The fruit is a cute side trick, but the horchata really is good.  I give it five stars because it reeks of unpretentiousness and we all know how much I loathe pretentiousness. The artwork is simple but quirkily Mexican, there is nothing fancy about the decor (which I like) and the cook looks like my Tio Memo (except he can cook whereas my Tio cannot).   Overall, I hope they don't change a damn thing here. Let it become as popular as they can but please, please, don't change what you have! Finally, some authentic (and I hate using that word) tacos in Phoenix.

This salon definitely lived up to expectations. I went in to donate my hair to Locks of love and got a great haircut and style. Alex, the stylist who worked on my hair, was great. I really liked that she wasn't super fake bubbly nor stone cold silent.   Overall, she was very helpful in communicating to me what I could do with my new, very short, hairdo. While it's a lot shorter than I'm used to, the haircut is great. They even called today to see how I liked my hair!  If you like non-frilly, not over the top trendy, and detail, this is a good spot. I may not go in every 6 weeks but I'll definitely go back.
