My precious little brother has been going on about Smoky Jon's for some time now and we finally made a trip that allowed us to head on into this fabulous establishment!  I couldn't quite decide what I wanted so I went with my usual BBQ joint pick - pork sandwich!  I opted for the potato salad and beans on the side.  My entire plate of food was delicious and I'd absolutely come back again.  The only thing I didn't love was my husbands chopped beef sandwich - but, lucky for me, I went with my ol' bbq joint standby ;)

Meh.  It was OK.  We were in Madison this past weekend for our 1st Anniversary and I really needed to find a place the first night that I could make reservations at seeing we were dining with our 7-month-old daughter - weren't sure how she was going to handle a long dinner out -  and I also needed a place that well, makes a damn good steak.  I figured it was safe to assume that something with Chophouse in the name would make a decent filet.    Things started off very promising.  Our server, Liz, was incredibly nice and was wonderfully sweet to us and our little girl.  She was very apologetic when it took a ridiculous amount of time to receive our first course - carpaccio and she even removed it from our bill.   She was great and she is the reason for one of the stars.  Finally after the carpaccio - which was quite delicious, not overly flavorful or brilliant, but good enough - we received our Caesar salads which were actually brilliant and delicious and receive star number two.   Though, in a "chophouse" a salad should NOT be the highlight of our meal.  FINALLY, our steak comes out.  We both ordered a filet done medium rare and while their level of doneness was not an issue, it was just the most absolute boring filet I've ever spent $38 on.  It was completely unseasoned and looked like it came off a Weber grill out back.  Scratch that, a filet off a Weber grill out back would have been far more delicious.  I was expecting something far more luxurious - a nice solid sear, etc.  This did not meet either of our expectations at all.   We went with the a side of mushrooms and they were pretty good.  By no means the best damn mushrooms I've ever eaten, but they were pretty good.  All in all, this place was a big miss for us and left a bit disappointed.  I kept saying we should just got to Ruth Chris', take our daughter to a chain, it'd be easier, this and that and dammit - we should have.    We certainly wouldn't make any effort to go back here, nor would we recommend it to anyone else.  The food just did not match the price point they seem to believe they're at.

Pretty lovely little Children's Museum!  Our little girl is still a bit too little to enjoy this place, but my husband and I really had a nice time walking around here.  I gotta say, I spent close to a dozen years in Chicago and spent an enormous amount of time at the Chicago Children's Museum and while I  prefer that one to this one - this one is still very very nice and should not be missed by families with little one.  I appreciate their focus on the environment here and loved the rooftop garden!  There didn't seem to be as much hands on stuff as I would like - no big water works area, digging area, etc.  I really really enjoyed that the little kid area had a great little room to nurse babies, with a comfy couch, fridge, etc. - how terrific!  I look forward to our next visit when our little girl will most likely enjoy it a bit more!

Pretty small and jam packed Whole Foods, but it's a Whole Foods and I've missed Whole Foods.   While I typically get irritated shopping here due to the prices there are a few specific things I must get at Whole Foods when I have the opportunity - their feta and pita. From their deli and food bar I must get  their japanese tofu and cucumber sesame noodles.  Also, Crispin cider, which most locations seem to carry.   Staff was nice and friendly here.  They did not have burrata cheese, which sucked, but I found it elsewhere in Madison.  All in all, nice little Whole Foods.

Fun little shop!  Love that they carry Zutano, Jefferies Socks, Haba, Robeez, etc. The guy behind the counter was very welcoming and nice.  Well laid out for a small shop, filled with great stuff, but not overwhelmingly packed - plenty of room to move around and browse.  A great spot to find age appropriate, fun and whimsical clothing items.  Wonderful place to find unique gifts.  My one complaint is their prices - a bit too high! Though, I realize they must have a smaller inventory, etc. which will be reflected in prices...   Overall, great little shop and I look forward to visiting again when we're back in Madison.

What a super nice Super 8!  We booked through Hotwire and chose a "Secret Hotel" and I admit, I was a bit bummed to see that we were given a Super 8.  However, I shouldn't have been, at all.  This place was really quite nice and the manager, Josh, went above and beyond to make sure we had a room with a fridge.  Everything was very good here for a two-star motel.  Rooms were comfy, clean and well equipped.  The pool was very nice and clean.  Breakfast was your typical, but tasty, continental fare.  Every employee we encountered was pleasant.   There is a lot of annoying construction going on around this place right now.  Which didn't really cause any huge issues, just a few minor traffic annoyances.  This is a perfectly fine location if you plan to get around Madison by car.  It is close to everything one would go to Madison for.     Again, I was disappointed to see Super 8 pop up in my "Secret Hotel" reveal, but now, I'm glad it worked out that way.  Great place at a great price.

We were in dire need of Haribo.  I did a little research before we headed to Madison and was directed to Bavaria Sausage Kitchen.  Sausage and Haribo - yes please!  The shop is small, but well stocked.  Plenty of German and a few Dutch delights.  Due to the fact that they're a pretty small shop, their prices definitely reflect that.  Their prices were a bit on the high side and much of the stuff could be ordered much cheaper online.  HOWEVER, it's always nice to browse in person,  We walked out of there with about $50 in Haribo alone - so obviously, they had a very nice selection!  Tried some sausage as well, the deli sliced Alps salami was ok and their summer sausage very good.  They're closed on Sundays, otherwise, we might have stocked up on a variety of their sausages and other freezer items on our way home.  Overall, nice little place and I imagine we'll be back the next time we're in Madison!

Very enjoyable dinner.  I had the pork loin with a tarragon sauce, amazing veggies and roasted garlic potatoes.   Boyfriend had the pecan crusted trout with wild rice and veggies.  Yum yum!  Dinner servers were sweet and efficient.  House wine is a pretty darn decent $18.00 bottle.  Good stuff.  After several days on the road eating diner food and fast food, this was very very welcomed.    Breakfast, while tasty, very tasty, service was slow and nonexistent.  We both had the huevos rancheros and they were very very good. Massive portions.   Not sure what was up between the night and day on service, short staffing could have been an issue, not sure.  The food is really good though and dinner service certainly wowed us.

How the flying frickity frackity does this place have 4 stars on over 500 reviews?   This place was crap.  We waited over a half hour to get in here and I ate a burger for the first time in over 2 years and I was very very much reminded why I gave up such things.   I figured if I was going to eat a burger after all that time I was going to eat one in a restaurant by the darling Hubert Keller.  After such a memorable Fleur dy Lys experience, we figured we certainly couldn't have a bad burger joint experience.... but we did.  The cheese is placed on the burger far too early on the grill, therefore it all melts and slides off, by the time it gets out to the table there's pretty much no cheese.  My bun was soooooo soggy on the bottom that I almost gagged.  The raw onions, flimsy and flavorless, the tomato orange and unripe.   What a disappointment.  My husband was equally disappointed with his fancy burger.    There was nothing that could have gained this place a 2nd star.  Service was shit, even the soda was flat and syrupy.  I'm seriously trying to figure out how our experience was so 1 star compared to all these 3, 4 and 5 star reviews?   What are you all comparing these burgers to?

Casino review.  Disgusting smell.  I had a horrible head cold, could barely smell or taste a thing and even I was nauseated by the smell.  What IS that smell?  We couldn't get out of there fast enough.  We considered dining at one of their many restaurants and based on the smell decided against that.

Impressed!  I was NOT looking forward to staying here.  I was hoping we could do Palazzo, etc. - but my mother was tagging along to hang out with our daughter one night and we were purchasing two rooms, so we needed something well located and far less expensive.  We found an excellent rate for two Go Deluxe rooms and I gotta say - we'd most definitely consider coming back here!  The prices are right, the location is excellent!  Downfall - wouldn't hit any of the restaurants or entertainment here, but you're a hop, skip and a jump from all the places you will want to dine at, etc.    Beds were comfy, pillows were too thick and hard.  Bathroom was fine enough.  Only issue, lots of dishes left out in the hallways - some for 24+ hours, not cool.  Carpeting could be updated in the hallways.  All in all, impressed by Flamingo's GO DELUXE rooms.  Might even come back

I don't do buffets.  I don't like them, if I'm going to go to one I can be very picky and whiny.  Before this, there was one buffet I liked and one only... but now, I would happily go back to The Buffet.  It was good, it was sooooo good.  It wasn't as overwhelming as I thought it might be and the food was really really good!   Some amazing Asian noodle dishes, pasta dishes, seafood.  There was sushi, but I don't do buffet sushi... it didn't look lovely enough for me to try.  Several different meat stations were available as well.    The desserts were incredible.  Wow.  Banana's foster, bread pudding, you name it, they had it!   Beautiful breads and vegetable sides.  It took about 30min in line but it was worth the wait and we needed to be at Bellagio for "O" so it worked out awesomely!   The one shocking thing we learned from the family in front of us, kids older then 3-years-old are charged full price!  So I'm not sure I'd bring picky kids to The Buffet unless they'll eat almost $30 worth of pizza and sweets ;)

I f-ing love this place.  It's where we had breakfast , well, three of the three mornings we were in Vegas.   I prefer savory to sweet crepes, unless they're just buttered and sugared....  I'm a less is more kind of a gal.   This place is truly top notch in my book!  They're huge and well, maybe it's 'cause I'm from downtown Chicago... but I don't find $9.99 for a crepe than can feed two to be at all over priced.

Lovely and beautiful.  Visually stunning, charming and even funny at times!  I've seen Mystere, Zumanity and LOVE in the past and I love LOVE but you cannot even begin to compare LOVE and O.  They're both so spectacular, but the stunts, the diving, etc. of O is breathtaking and awe inspiring!  We sat in in Section 204, Row R  and it was a great spot.  We were slightly bummed beforehand, but  there wasn't much available seating wise for same day tickets.  They're not easy to come by from discount ticketers so I urge you to buy them online before your trip or a couple of days in advance from the box office at Bellagio!   What a magical, memorable experience!  Skip Mystere and Zumanity and go straight to O or LOVE!  Pick Mystere over Zumanity if you can't get either, Mystere definitley is a lovely show, just not quite as good as O or LOVE!

Very good diner fare!   I opted for the soup and sandwich combo - Reuben and clam chowder.  Both picks were very good, though the chowder was quite heavy on the thyme.  The Reuben was typical delicious.    While I wanted to crawl into the pie and cake cases and eat them all - I decided to just take home a piece of the coconut cream pie.  My favorite - and it didn't disappoint!    Service was friendly, food came out quick and hot. I'm not in sun prairie often - but I'd head back in if I'm there!

Incredible.  Service was fantastic, a level of service that just isn't quite reached in most restaurants, fine dining or otherwise.  Some of the most polished, yet friendly and approachable I've experienced.   Food, it goes with out saying on a 5-star review that the food was extraordinary.   We opted for the four course "Elegance" tasting menu and were not disappointed.  The only dish that didn't quite live up to my husbands hopes was a ravioli option, but even that was still very good for something he wouldn't have typically ordered.   I won't go into each option because I imagine the menu changes often, but if you have a chance to try the onion soup, do so, it is incredible.   The final surprise of the night were the incredible desserts!  I very much hope to dine at Hubert Keller's Fleur de Lys again.   Hubert just so happened to be there the night we dined and what a very nice, friendly man he is!

Oh Ian's Pizza how I wish you lived near me... oh who am I kidding... how I wish I lived near YOU.  I can only speak for the kalamata mozzarella slice and it was mother frickin' frackin' delicious.  That is a damn 5 star slice o' pizza.  So good.  So amazingly good.  I could eat a slice every day good.  Oh right, I had a bite of a mushroom something or other pizza - deeeeelicious as well.  Health-wise, It's probably best we aren't neighbors.

My goodness, I have missed you.  We headed to Madison for our 1st anniversary and since we booked the hotel I was trying to get my hands on a large cooler so I could stock up on my loved and very missed items at Trader Joe's.  Thank you husbands coworker for the mighty fine cooler you provided!    This is a particularly nice and well stocked Trader Joe's!  The parking, as everyone claims, truly is a bit of a pain in the ass - oh well, parking at the one I frequented in Chicago was a bigger pain in the ass.   The staff here is just as nice as any other TJ's, maybe a little nicer.  I was surprised by how well stocked everything was considering how busy it was and that it was a Sunday morning.   We walked out of here with $180 worth of deliciousness and we have now decided to purchase a deep freezer - well, we've been wanting to for quite some time, but this little trip and 1st time trip for my husband really helped seal the deal I think - and make a trip from good ol' Wausau every other month or so.    My god I've missed this place.

Had an absolutely fantastic lunch at Batali's  Enoteca San Marco! The food was outstanding.  My husband enjoyed the meatball dish and I had the cavatappi which was truly extraordinary.   One of the best dishes I had during our time in Vegas.  Service was so-so, seemed a little rushed for a 1/2 empty place.   We dined at B&B Ristorante last year and surprisingly found Enoteca San Marco to be a much much better experience food wise!

Incredible and  Fantastic and Amazing.  The rooms are beautiful and elegant, spacious with gorgeous furnishings.  The only reason I can't go 5 stars is because the comfort of the bed and the bedding could definitley be improved.    The bed is the most important element of a hotel room, correct?   The bathroom is beautiful.  The rooms are very similar to the Venetian rooms, but I do recall the beds being a bit nicer over there, though, it's been a few years since we've stayed there.    The restaurants in The Palazzo are good!  Really enjoyed Woo and Table 10.  Very easy access to Venetian and the Grande Canal  Shoppes and the incredible Venetian restaurants.   You can spend all day...even 2 or 3... between The Palazzo and The Venetian and never run out of things to do and see or eat.  Be sure to see The Jersey Boys while there!    The Palazzo is a very very solid choice in Vegas.

Fun and solid lunch by my lonesome at Table 10!  The corn chowder was amazing, I have no idea why I was compelled to order it, but I certainly am glad that I did!  It was VERY good.  The tempura ahi tuna dish was very good.  The corn, shiitake and cabbage chow chow was a touch too vinegary for me, but that's simply a personal preference issue.  The tuna was prepared perfectly and the sauces that accompanied the dish were lovely and really balanced the chow chow for me.  Service was so very friendly and efficient!  Cute decor, well spaced tables and very very accommodating of a solo diner.

Oh what a night...!  Ha!  Fantastic, seriously, what a hell of a show this was.   I heard a lot of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons growing up, but I learned that I am far FAR more familiar with them than I ever thought!  I knew and enjoyed every single song.  Seriously, I was not unfamiliar with a single one, thanks mom!  This show is one for almost all ages... I would say 14 to 105.  They allow 12 and up, but I'd say it's far more appropriate for 14+.   Loads of swearing and a short scene of sexual references with scantily clad woman.  This two hour and ten minute show flew by!  I was sad when it was over!  I missed the production when it hit Chicago, so I was glad to catch it tonight in Vegas!    It was amazing, I was born in 1980... but I felt as though I got the chance to see a real Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons concert!   Travis Cloer WAS Frankie Valli, he just was... I clearly do not remember Frankie Valli in his prime, but I certainly feel like I do now!  Fantastic cast, every single one of them!   I'd see Jersey Boys again and again.

Ok.  So, we were pretty much just tired and hungry when we arrived last night and didn't want to venture out far from our room for dinner, so we strolled into Woo.  Like many other reviewers state, the place was pretty empty, though, it was Wednesday night, so I wasn't all that alarmed.   I was seriously not expecting much at all.  For starters, our waiter was more than a touch strange, weird vibe coming off that one for sure.  The decor was lacking and the menu appeared to be priced highly for what we'd seen of the place so far.  Then, THEN, our drinks arrived.  I very highly recommend the amazingness that is the Woo-Tini.  Wonderfully sweet and tart and fresh tasting.  The menu is a little weird, it's pretty much filled with shared plates.  We chose the Tuna Tartare which was fantastic, the escargot which was extraordinary.  We love Thai escargot and this surpassed our best Thai escargot experience.  The highlight of the night, for sure.  We also did the black cod miso which was very good, but a touch disappointing considering it was a $20 dish.  The other highlight of the night was the salt and pepper calamari.  Wow.  It was unlike any other salt and pepper anything I have consumed.    The portions are pretty small for sharing so we ended having the bread pudding dessert as well, which was also outstanding.  The passion fruit sorbet was extremely tart, which isn't my thing, but my husband really loved it.  We were so pleasantly surprised by the flavors and freshness of each plate!  We came in here absolutely starving, ravenous.  Not exactly the best option for our hunger level, but we would absolutely come back here... The price is way WAY to high for 5 stars, but based on quality and taste, I do have to go with 4.   Our food experience was definitley 5 stars.

Ok.I have been searching for this pizza since I vacationed in Italy back in 2010.  Pizza Brutta blew me away yesterday.  I always like to go with the margherita when trying a new, Neapolitan style, pizza place.  Theirs was absolutely delicious.  My husband went with the Rosso Verde which was also incredible.  Both pizzas looked like they were hand delivered to our table from Italy.  Perfect amount of toppings - not TOO many, just the way it SHOULD be.  They were chewy and slightly charred, perfectly tomatoe-y and the right amount of salty  - just the way they SHOULD be!  Perfection, truly.  Staff was incredibly nice and I loved the counter service style of the place.     Oh right, and not only is their pizza brilliantly delicious - their gorgonzola salad was also amazing.  Holy crap was the dressing delicious.    Pretty sure I'm going to move to Madison so I can eat Pizza Brutta whenever I want.

Best meal of the trip, best meal of the year so far.  The place was packed and we planned on waiting an hour or so before being seated so we took ourselves to the bar to have a drink... little did we know that the drinks were going to be amazing fun and we'd each have three and very quickly fill up that hour wait!  The girls behind the bar whipped up and recommended drinks and every single one was amazing, between the two of use we had 5 different cocktails!  The Nevada and Whipple were two of the best cocktails I've ever had in my entire life!  They may look like small cocktails, but they pack a punch, seriously.  Enjoy looking at the bar menu, many of the cocktails come from drink books from years past.  Tom Collins, Gimlets, you name it!  Very cool.  We were then seated at a lovely table by the window and greeted by our very sweet server!  I wish I caught her name, she was very polite and informative.  We started off with the chilled selfish platter.  Extraordinary.  Oysters, crab, lobster, some amazing sashimi with horseradish panna cotta.  I was not a fan of the geoduck, but it was interesting to try!  My ex-husband had the mixed grill and enjoyed every bit of it.  I tried a piece of his calamari and it was outstanding.  I had the big eye tuna and it was incredible.  Perfectly rare, perfectly sauced.  Perfect.  We both ordered from the Wood-fire section of the menu and received the best vegetables we've ever had on a plate of food.  So much fun, mini potatoes, tiny beet chips, orange peppers and more laid on vibrant romesco sauce.  Our plates were visually stunning.  We ended up choosing two sides, which I don't recommend, it's a lot of food, but we wanted to try the whipped potatoes and cauliflower and were not surprised to have been completely thrilled by them!  My husband despises cauliflower, has a very very serious hatred for the lovely veg, so much in fact that he'd really rather I not cook it the house because the smell makes him gag... guess who loved the cauliflower?  That's right, my husband!  The dessert menu looked beautiful but we couldn't fit another crumb in us!  Which reminds me, the blue corn muffins and bread basket were to die for.  The best EVER and I have consumed a lot of corn muffins in my life.  Soft and moist and beautiful.  This place was perfection.  You cannot possible go wrong at Michael Mina's American Fish.

Great!  Clean, spacious rooms, comfy beds, nice bathrooms, upgraded features, friendly staff, decent  (pay) breakfast!  We scored this place via a mystery hotel through Expedia or Travelocity or something - so the price was right.   Only downside - location wasn't really ideal for us.   Overall, nice place and a place we'd consider again in the future.

Clean, well designed, easy to navigate.  Loved this place.  Picked up a few bath bombs, scents are fantastic and found a table of $10 "Mystery Bags" in the back... GET ONE, mine was loaded with six of their gorgeous bars of soap!  $40.00 worth for $10... can't beat that.    This place is a bit like the store LUSH, but definitley at a better price point.  Not as much variety, they have shampoo bars, bath bombs, sugar scrubs, body wash, lotions and bar soaps.  Didn't appear to be any facial products or hair conditioners.

Headed in for an early dinner with our 7-month-old in tow.  They were offering a limited menu at that time, which was more than fine with us.  After a too long dinner the night before it allowed us to give Graze a whirl without subjecting our daughter to another two hour dinner.    Service was nice, without being overly the top friendly - more of the down-to-earth level of friendly, which was nice and how I prefer service to be.  They very kindly parked our stroller for us and presented us with a very clean high chair - which, let me tell you, is a bit of a rarity.  I didn't have to wipe this one down before we placed our daughter in.    We had a carb filled food fest here.  We started with the pretzel - delicious!  Loved the mustards (especially the tarragon and horseradish)  and the brick cheese spread was lovely.  We also went with a cheese plate and I was pleased with them all.  The walnut bread was quite nice and the compote was tasty.  We both went with the Pub Burger and were very impressed.  I love a burger with a little garden of loveliness on top, however, most places I have to pick off a not-yet-ripe tomato, or not-so-crisp onions or soggy lettuce.  I'm a bit of a pain in the ass when it comes to topping my burger - the ingredients must be perfect.  Theirs were complete and total perfection.  The only minor issue was my English muffin was a bit too soggy, but otherwise, it was delicious.  It was cooked perfectly medium rare and was the perfect size 1/4lb patty.  Delicious, not obnoxious and huge.  The portion of fries with a side of garlic aioli was enormous and tasty.    Truly, a great meal was had here!  I was nervous about bringing our daughter - but was touched by the fact that her presence was no big deal at all.  So, if you have kids and they're well behaved or you're good about being on top of their happiness while dining and are mindful of fellow diners - go ahead and bring them here.   We look forward to dining at Graze again!

I was a big fan of the restaurant that used to be in this spot.  The current Batali and Bastianich pizzeria that took over did not disappoint our group of six.  The pizzas (the Romana and a sweet onion w/ proscuitto!) were delicious, the salads excellent and the deep fried cauliflower was awesome.  Only complaint - it wasn't at all busy and everything seemed to take forever!

Ugh.  Their customs area SUCKS.  Sucks sucks sucks and sucks some more.  If I can help it I will not be flying internationally out of CLT again.  We were in line well over an hour, you can't use your cell phone in line, so you can't check status of the flight your about to miss... you can't get ahead of the game to rebook a flight.  What a nightmare.    The customs officers are a a bit too friendly and chatty.  If they'd just shoosh and do their job we'd all probably got through that quicker and less people would have missed their connection.

Well.  There were items I loved and others I didn't - at all.  Absolutely loved and adored the pork belly taco bao.  So good.  Would go back to have a million of those.  The bao sampler was a big ol' miss - I didn't really enjoy any of them.  They all seemed quite dry and lacking in flavor.  With that said - my kids (3 and 19months) liked them, so great.  We picked a noodle bowl which was really delicious and I'm eager to try more on the noodle side.  The little dumpling add ons were also a bit of a miss.  Maybe we chose poorly on some items.   Who knows.  Regardless of the couple of misses I liked what we liked so much that I would go back to try more.  Bonus - honeydew tea. Delicious!

Uh, I completely forgot we were in an airport while dining here!  Delicious! I had some of the best carnitas tacos and my husband's quesadilla was ridiculously tasty.  Service was awesome and quick.  Hell, I look forward to connecting through PHX again in the future!
