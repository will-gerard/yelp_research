Quite possibly my favorite food truck in Phoenix.  Everything on their menu sounds amazing, so deciding which dog I would like by the time it's my turn to place my order can sometimes be a challenge. But have no worries. Whatever you order will be delicious. When I'm not feeling adventurous to try something new from the menu, I usually order the Moki with a spicy beer hot dog and a side of fried pickles. Yum!

My wife and I were craving some asian noodles and stumbled upon this place.  Some might be wary to try this place because it shares a building with Party City (essentially behind the store), but some of the best restaurants I've been to can be found in least than ideal locations.  When we entered, we were welcomed immediately and pleasantly surprised by the overall vibe.  The bar was packed and overlooks the open kitchen where flames were shooting above the woks.  I was keen on the reggae/island/jam band background music as well (Passafire, Dirty Heads, Slightly Stoopid to name a few of the bands).  Once seated, we noticed the beer and wine options written on the walls and were  very impressed with the large selection.  Service was speedy.  We quickly got our drinks and ordered the spring rolls as an appetizer.  They were very flavorful.  My wife and I both noticed a cinnamon taste at the end of each bite (possibly Chinese five spice).  For the perfect spring roll bite, I recommend dipping it in the plum sauce along with a bit of Sriracha.  For our entrees, we were looking for spicy dishes and went with the Hokkien Mee and Lantern Flame.  Both were very tasty and hit the spot.  When it comes to the level of spiciness, I would say it was on the mild side for my liking (still delicious).  However, my wife and I are heat fanatics, so me stating it was mild would probably mean that the dishes had adequate spicy flavor for the general public.  The portions are hearty, so there was plenty for leftovers.  You certainly get your money's worth and then some.  We will definitely be back!

CrossFit Infernal is more than just a place to get a good sweat on.  It doesn't matter if it's your first day or you've been a member for years. The moment you walk in the door, the coaches and other members treat you like family. The coaches are very thorough in demonstrating movements and always make sure individuals are using proper form to ensure their safety and to prevent injury. The workouts can be catered to people of all fitness levels. Of course, there can be some friendly competition during the WODs, but everyone is still rooting for one another the whole time.  Give CrossFit Infernal a try and I'm sure you'll get instantly hooked just like me. I will never go back to working out at a conventional gym again!

My co-workers and I decided to try this place for lunch.  I was slightly skeptical to begin with being the carnivore that I am, but I figured I'd branch out beyond my typical lunch spots.  The ambience was as I expected a vegetarian/vegan cafe would be with a spiritual/yogi vibe.  When we got there, a few people were seated and it was far from what I would consider busy.  We placed our orders and took a seat while we waited for our food...and waited...and waited.  My colleagues ordered smoothies and a salad and I got the portabello cheese steak sandwich with a cup of the spicy roasted tomato vegetable soup.  All items that you would think could be put together and be in customer's hands within 10 - 15 minutes tops.  From placing our order to having food in hand, this quick 'to-go' lunch stop ended up taking almost 40 minutes!   Although I thought my food was flavorful, my sandwich did not stay in sandwich form for long.  With every bite, more and more of the sandwich kept spilling out the sides.  At the same time, my soup was more of the consistency of chunky mashed potatoes.  Unfortunately for my co-workers, their salad left a lot to be desired and they resorted to tossing it out.  For the time our adventure took and the price (forgot to mention that you should probably be ready for some sticker shock), I probably won't give this place another attempt.

The staff was great and so was their beer. My only recommendation would be to install TVs. Mumford and Sons on repeat will only keep patrons there for so long.

This food truck is awesome!! PouÂ·tine (Noun): Canadian delicacy consisting of french fries covered in gravy and cheese curds.  I was already sold by that definition alone, but American Poutine Co. took it up a notch.  Everything on their menu sounded delicious.  I showed some self-restraint by not ordering one of everything on the menu and went with the Porker Poutine.  To start, they don't use fries straight from your grocer's freezer.  They use quality fresh-cut hearty potatoes for the base of the dish.  They certainly did not skimp on the pulled pork which was super smoky or the thick and crispy bacon.  All of that was slathered in gravy and sprinkled with cheese curds.  An explosion of deliciousness in each and every bite.  The American Poutine Co. has to be one of my top 3 favorite food trucks in the Phoenix area!
