Today was the last time I'll ever come to this dunkin donuts. The first time we came here my boyfriend got food poisoning and today the guy took my boyfriends order then walked away and when I tried to order all I could get out was "bagel with cream cheese" and he walked away without letting me finish ordering. Then I noticed I hadn't gotten my coffee and when i got my food it was missing an item. The guy said(with attitude) I had to pay for it, which I did after the fact. While waiting for my item the man preparing it was on his cell phone complaining about how much customers are complaining that their order is wrong when it's busy.

I came in here with my friend who is getting married. She had an appointment and I didn't but they were still able to fit me in. All the technicians we dealt with were super sweet and had great personalities! Special shout out to Phoebe and Lovely you guys rock! Thanks again for the great service and conversation.
