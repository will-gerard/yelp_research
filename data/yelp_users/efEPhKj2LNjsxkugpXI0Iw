Worst Pad Thai yet. Tasted like a dollop of Skippy peanut butter had been added AND they actually substituted parsley for cilantro!

A good example of a fast casual restaurant with integrity in it's business model and great food to match. Wish more franchises would take note.

Really wanted to like this place. Brisket was tough and rubbery. Cobbler was average. Hostess lacked warmth and scruples.
