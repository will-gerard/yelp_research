So happy that yelp helps me decided what I'm going to have for dinner at the last minute! This place was a gift that I stumbled upon while doing a simple yelp search by my new place. Without a doubt; I discovered my new fav Mexican restaurant!   Nice and clean inside with classic Mexican decor and plenty of seating.   The service was fast and our server was very smiley. I love a happy server!! Very quick to bring out chips and salsa AND beans! What a treat! Beans with your chips, winner! I split a cheese crisp and shrimp fajitas with my boyfriend. The cheese crisp was a delicious classic and the fajitas were tasty and served on the nice hot plate.   Will definitely be coming back for more!

i have been to this place three times and tell everyone about it. This place is super professional. talk about being spoiled- this place soaks your feet and massages your face, scalp, arms, hands, legs, feet, neck, and back. from the complimentary water to the hot towel they place under your neck- i'm in love. They even have frequent customer cards.

Yummy! We arrived shortly before close and still received stellar service. They had had a busy lunch and were out of quite a bit of the crepe fillings. But the Staff was super friendly and answered questions and offered  their suggestions when we couldn't decide in which dessert crepe we were gonna have.    I enjoyed the breakfast burrito with no bacon and a vanilla bean crepe w strawberries.  One of the friends I was with got the breakfast burrito with bacon. It had a white bacon powder on it that was a mystery fluff to us before we asked. Apparently is has a subtle bacon flavor. Either way; the idea was creative and original but may have fallen short of its potential.   Before entries came out they brought dehydrated kale chips and a gummy candy treat. It was perfect! After we finished those they brought out a granola mix; which was a little sweet for my palate, but still enjoyable.   The complimentary treats were much appreciated!   Overall vibe of the place is pretty chill with attractive art work.

Great experience! Delicious food! Fantastic live music!  The host Sarah worked well when our party of 3-5 turned into a party of 8. Thanks girl! We even switched tables (which can be annoying) and the staff didn't express any irritation. We decided on Salut because of their $5 Martinis (on Wednesdays) which were pineapple tonight! mmm tasty and not overly sweet.  Our server Adele took great care of us! I switched  to the house pino noir which was perfect with the hummus nachos! My friends got a couple of reasonably priced pitchers of Rolling Rock and the Salut fries. We shared a bruchetta board which was a hit! You get a choice of 4 different bruchettas for $12. We got the garlic & roasted red pepper, fig & goat cheese (FAV!), mushroom & sundried tomatoes (OH YUMM), and pesto & tomato.   It was free s'more night also. We got two platters of graham crackers w chocolate pieces, marshmallows, metal skewers,and a hot coal pot to roast the marshmallows! Super tasty!   We had the delight of meeting the manager and even got to meet the owner. They were fun and made our night amazing. Lots of laughs and great food & drinks! We will definitely be back!

Came in for happy hour on a Wednesday and Opted to sit outside instead of at the bar. Patrice took great care of us. We enjoyed their $5 happy hour margaritas, the guys I was with got the $1.99 daily tacos, and I had one of the most delicious vegetable tacos of my life. I will be back for the great service and yummy tacos.

First time here, love the vibe. Got a seat outside on the patio. Had great service from Melinda. She hooked it up w a tasty pancake while we waited for our food. My harvest Benny ended up not being my fav which wasn't a big deal to me but the management ended up giving me a discount. I dig this place. Everyone that works here seems happy which feeds the over all positive welcome vibe.

Previous reviews got me here, and it stood up to its reputation.  This place is very clean and super friendly. A friend of mine came into town and we last minute decided on pedis. We were able to walk in with no appointment but i wouldn't recommend it. They only have one spa chair for pedicures which was kinda awkward. Thankfully our tech was awesome and made the time pass by with putting smiles on our faces and laughs in our bellys.

What a quaint little gem! Enjoyed a nice relaxing lunch on the patio with my pooch; my friendly server Alexis even brought out chilled water for my pup. I started with the vegan asparagus soup- holy cow- asparagus soup?! Delish! The dirty chai I had was on point as well as the open faced club. I wrapped up the lunch with a creme' puff with raspberries and the most amazing blueberry lavender infused icecream!   They offer free wifi and were ok with me sitting on the computer for a while.   Chill place. Cutest place mats and interior decor. I'll be back for sure!

I have been wanting to try this place for a while now and still didn't really get to try it. I went there with my pooch and sat on the patio. Despite my flaky friend not showing up I decided to stay. It was a cloudy day and a little chilly so I ordered a hot almond milk latte. (I love places that offer more than the normal milk n soy options.) One of the staff members was very willing to turn on one of the outside heaters for me. Almost immediately after ordering my Latte it started raining. They rapidly put up the umbrellas in an attempt to keep my pooch and I dry. This is when i received several drama filled phone calls and stirred up emotion for me. I was crying, wet, and had a miserable dog. I got my latte to go.   I am writing this review Because of the great smiling service I received. I had multiple check ins by several different staff members. They truly did everything they could. Thanks guys- keep up the good work.   Can't wait to try your food.

Happy to have found a vegan/vegetarian spot; however my experience was a flop. I dig the small menu... But only when it's available. We tried to order the jackfruit sliders and they were out of them on a Saturday Night at 6:30pm... Sucks for them it is one of their most expensive menu items for $11. And one of 10 items on the menu. We opted for the calabacitas burrito and the chili Guac fries. Sad... Just sad.. The burrito was lacking in many ways.  Unseasoned squash, no sauce, small, dripping in oil, and wrapped in a thick store bought flour tortilla. Each bite tasted like a mouth full of flour. The fries seemed like they were cooked hours before and were limp and Luke warm... Served with a cinnamon ketchup thing.  I was happy to see an effort for culinary skill,  even though it was not the best flavor it saved the bland wrap.  The nachos were ok. The Guac had a nice flavor and the Chili wasn't bad. But the fries underneath were the same limp old Luke warm fries.   In the end probably won't be back... Note to the business... If you are reaching to a picky niche market like vegans/vegetarians make it it f'n awesome and have it available.

Visit number two and still unimpressed.   I didn't mentioned in my first review; but the order at the counter concept does not work with their layout. Not at all. It's awkward and cramped.   I can see how it could take quite a bit of time when there is only one person taking orders, making drinks, and answering the phone. The counter gal seemed to be frustrated. She received a phone call from someone trying to order two burgers. She sternly affirmed they were a vegan restaurant and offered no alternative options. She seemed off put and didn't have the best customer service skills, especially when it came to informing meat eaters that vegan restaurants offer 'great food' still!   As a previous bartender I also found it slightly humorous when a female customer asked for a 'really light beer' and she suggested an IPA. She followed with orange blossom which was a much better option. Well there's my nit picky service review.   Food- got the cauliflower tacos. Wanted to love them because I was starving. Over all presentation was great. But I had to add Cholula sauce to give it any flavor. I could hardly taste the red(?) avocado cream dressing. The corn tortillas were also hard :/ the cauliflower was nicely fried but still lacked flavor.   I look forward to the next vegan restaurant...  But hey; thanks for existing. I still chose to come to the Coronado instead of their near by competitor Green. I still vote for vegetables instead of soy based processed mock meats.
