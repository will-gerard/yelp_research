Though the service is always cheery, they messed up my order (for the third time) and I had SERIOUS acid reflex (for the first time in my life) because of the "Cajun Shrimp Pasta" and I didn't even eat half of it. I am in extreme pain and writing this review at nearly 2 am because I can't sleep.   I am from Louisiana. Southern food doesn't hurt me. This is painful.

If you're looking for an art warehouse, HERE'S your place. Decor is super cool, staff was extremely friendly-- overall a wonderful experience.   Also, everything is super cheap compared to major craft stores and it felt much more homey, to say the least.

Atmosphere is a little weird but the food is always awesome :) service is so-so, but they get the job done. The gyro plate may seem over priced, but it's really big.

The best wings in chandler I swear! I love wings, I eat them at least twice a week, and these are better than any others (I have tried Thai Peanut and Buffalo Regular, Buffalo is the best) Yes, it's noisy in here but you'll never have trouble watching the game, plenty of flat screens in here!   Service was great too, the one time I was in a rush, our waitress got us in and out in a hurry. My new favorite dinner place :)

I have absolutely NO complaints. I actually had trouble finding the place, and was about 5 minutes late. No problem for Dr. Falcon! Then I  found out I was nearsighted and wasn't sure how to chose glasses, so the ladies up front helped me look at different glasses and decide which ones were best for me. She also treats my sister, who has serious eye problems, and my sister ALSO suggest Dr. Falcon to everyone she meets.  The staff is helpful, friendly, and totally NOT intimidating. It'll be a great experience, I guarantee.

This is by far the best Chinese place in Chandler. It's super cheap and you get tons of food, and the noodles are fantastic (and also hand pulled).   I have always ordered the seafood hand-pull noodle plate with handpull noodles. Take out or eat in, this is a great option for anyone who needs to eat fast (they normally operate very quickly).

This is THE PLACE to eat in Chandler. My family has been coming here since I was a little kid. Common favorites are the morning monte, the breakfast sandwich, or just their perfect combo platter! They have a great location (near downtown but with better parking), and near the outdoor seating is their neighbors bird collection (it sounds gross, but it totally isn't. And if you don't like birds, it's okay, because they're always about a house away). Sometimes the wait is long, but the trade off for cheery service, amazing noms, and local/small atmosphere makes it worth it :)

I have been coming her for years, waitress knows my order, all that jazz.  Recently tried the breakfast sandwich and I'm hooked! Try it with egg whites, havarti, and bacon-- it's killer!!!

The people are nice and the service is good, it's just so expensive I can barely stand it. I get it, it's "fashion" or whatever but seriously. I get my hair cut here and that's it, and I hate having to have things done other places.  In any case, great people and great cuts. I just can't bear to go there for much more.

I had the eggs Benedict, which may have been the best I've ever had!! I'm not normally a huge fan of potatoes, but there's are the best, I am addicted! I also had the sunrise smoothie, and it tastes a lot like a soft sherbet ice cream, so if you're into that-- go for it.   Overall, I loved the experience! My only suggestion would be to make it less difficult to find napkins :( I had to ask a bartender for some because there were none anywhere where customers could get them.

Talebu is where I spend ALL of my time. Seriously all of it. I spent 6 hours there yesterday. Every day after school, the kids of the CPA debate team come and do work over there. The regular baristas are nice and super happy and polite. Recently, however, I've had some concerns.   They hired some new baristas and they simply don't make the drinks well. Yesterday I had a Green Tea Frappe that tasted like it was watered down and near flavorless from the moment I got it. It would probably be wise for them to learn how to make the drinks before they're sold to customers.   Hopefully these baristas learn soon because I want to be there and enjoy my drink again XD not have to bear it just to support the place I love to be.

By far my favorite pizza place in Phoenix (even better than NYPD). The personal pan is just the right size for me! I get the the two different sausages with extra cheese and garlic sauce (rather than tomato), always knocks me out!

Cheddars has an absolutely FANTASTIC atmosphere. Lighting is always great, noise level is moderate. It's a great place to go on a semi-formal dinner, without dumb prices. The seating is plentiful and the tables are big.   Also, the croissants are ambrosia (God Food), just so you know. So order 12 and you should be set. Be weary of the red beans and rice, it's a little too watery for my taste.   I come here all the time with my family or with friends, it's a great place to enjoy a meal.

Ambience is essentially "trying too hard" embodied. The food is good, but what I had in particular was very poorly made. Eggs Benedict is really sour, I have no idea why. When I took a bite, I thought it was rotten. I didn't get sick, so I think it was just the flavor. The potatoes are good though.

I don't know why there's never anyone here!!!!! This place is my absolute favorite and go to when I'm in a rush.   Essentially it's subway for stir fry-- but also salads and panini's and wraps... Or whatever. So basically subway for everyone.   It is always clean and always pretty quiet. Lots and lots of options! My go to is the shrimp hot bowl with noodles and teriyaki with water chestnuts, garbanzo beans, bean sprouts and bell pepper. But you can literally have whatever suits your fancy.  Also, the service is always great! Super friendly and funny people working here.   There are no downsides to eating here. PLEASE COME HERE OH GOODNESS ITS AMAZING!

I come here probably 3 times a week and I always order a number 13. It's not only consistent, but it's also delicious. The interior is super new. Sometimes there's a bit of a wait but it's always worth it! Service is not noticeable, which is good when it's not s place with a wait staff XD

Anyplace that serves breakfast potatoes and not hash browns can't get 5 stars from me but they came pretty close :) service is quick-- food is good. I was particularly impressed with their eggs Benedict, they make it with croissant instead of an English muffin.
