The surgeon himself is great and I'm happy so far with my results. My issue is mainly with how they schedule.  For the pre-op and first post-op appt they schedule a group of people at one time, because the surgeon is only there a couple of times a month. They have no regard for their patients time. I can't use any more pto because I used most of it for the surgery. They would be better off using 15 min increments to schedule us. I'm on my lunch break now and so far have been waiting 45 mins. My other issue is they don't say the post op appointment is also a group thing. It's not fair to group schedule us. There were multiple people upset and even the receptionist stated that she gets yelled at every time.

This place is great. Reasonable prices, great stylists cute decor, very welcoming. It has a very hip vibe to it, lots of cool colored hair and great fashion but not so hipster that I felt uncomfortable. Parking situation isn't great but don't let that scare you off. The only thing I hated was the hair washing sinks. But just a minor thing. Brittany was my stylist today and I said I wanted blonde and I got it. The color looks amazing. I loved this place.

The employees were amazing, and they let me try the sauces before I ordered. I love dark meat chicken and it was delicious. They also let me know we can put as much sauce as you want, so get some on the side if you like a lot of sauce. It was very much like Chipotle in that the food is sitting there waiting to be used. I loved it here. Not every place is for everyone but I can't wait to go back. It was soooo goood!!!

Decided to try out the new salon in my area and was pleasantly surprised. I will say the guy who did my pedi was a little rough but I don't mind that. I wouldn't come here for a relaxing pedi but it was certainly efficient. I loved the way they do the callus remover and my feet are smoother than they've been in years. And I get pedicures all the time. They seemed to move people in and out pretty quickly. It's a cute place and it looked very clean. The tools were taken to the back as soon as we were done so I'm hoping they do sterilize. For my pedi the water was hot, the stones were hot and the towels were hot.  I would say the only fault is that it wasn't a spa experience but my pedi looks great.

The concept is great. It's a cute bar. The bouncers were very nice to us, even after we dropped a glass. The service at the bar is why I rated it so low. They need more bartenders. And maybe not hire "manic pixie dream girls" since they all looked like they had better things to do than serve drinks. 3 of our friends never even got a drink after 35 mins of standing there.
