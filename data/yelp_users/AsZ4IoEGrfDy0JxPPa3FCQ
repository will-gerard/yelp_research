Great restaurants here, but can they get a flight out on time?  Leaving PHX for SFO was almost an hour late and returning to HNL from PHX was 40 minutes late.  Geez...at least I was able to get there and didn't have other connecting flights.

Meh! Almost 2 hour flight from Sacramento to Phoenix this afternoon...very smooth, no turbulence, but not once were those of us in the main cabin offered a beverage. But the dopey flight attendant on Flight 596 kept strolling up and down the aisle 'collecting' the non existent service items. What's up with THAT US Airways?! I know airlines are trying to save money but that is just downright CHEAP! Meh! I'll choose another, less stingy, airline in the future.

Southwest Airlines...You will always be my first choice in air travel! I flew with another airline to use up an existing ticket...but whenever possible, I'm sticking with Southwest!

Excellent grilled fish for the fish tacos...not breaded and fried.  Perfectly cooked and served hot.  I would order these again and again!  Accompanied with a bloody mary and I was ready for the remaining leg of my journey home to HNL.

Pretty solid place. During my recent layover from San Diego to Austin, due to delayed flights and whatnot, I decided to have a filling breakfast since I wasn't sure when I'd be able to eat again...and not wanting to buy any of those 'snack' boxes on the plane.  I ordered the Enchilada and Eggs breakfast and it was massive...and filling.  No regrets :-)
