The salespeople here are nice enough, but Mark in particular, isn't very thorough. I went in to have my suit re-tailored and he finished ringing me up for some additional fixes (collar fold being the biggest one). I asked him before I left if I was being charged for everything and he said yet. I told him I needed the suit the next week for a wedding and he said I could pick it up Wednesday. I go in Wednesday and everything went wrong.  The salesperson that grabbed my suit said I still owed $35. When I asked what for he said the collar fix hadn't been rung up the first time. When he checked, it hadn't even been done. He tried to say they would fix it but I would have to pay. I refused. Then the pants were too long still. At this point I'm frustrated because I need the suit in two days for a wedding. Thankfully, they made the fix the same day and I avoided a potentially stressful situation.  I recommend going here for the bare basics. Anything above and beyond and you run the risk of having things done incorrectly.

This place is AWFUL! I went down here to buy a dinette set since I used to live in the area and had bought furniture at a place next door (which is no longer open). We met with Jerry who was very friendly. We found a set we liked and agreed on a Saturday delivery next week. I called Monday to let him know that some things had come up and ask if we could move it to Friday of next week. He told me no problem.  Come Friday, they never called despite being scheduled to deliver furniture between 2-5. My fiance had to call them to find out that they "just got the piece in that Friday and could not deliver until Saturday". Very unprofessional. At first, they said they could deliver it Sunday since Saturday did not work (I told them this back on Monday), but I wanted a refund instead. All of a sudden, they were able to deliver it Friday again as originally promised. Jerry told me, "Oh, he's putting the final piece on the furniture now and is on his way".   I never got a number for the driver in case they were closed before he arrived. When my fiance called back to ask for a number, they told her to wait until he shows up and that "they would not be closing early today". At this point, it's 6 PM and they close on 7 PM. I just don't trust them anymore. I drove down from North Scottsdale to go to the store in case the delivery guy never showed up. My fiance finally called me to say he had arrived and was just now assembling the furniture in our place. That doesn't match what Jerry told us.  All in all, very unprofessional. And to top it off, the table has a small nick on it from when he was putting it together. We even had to polish the table ourselves (it looks much better than what they dropped off now that we polished it). I will never do business with Jerry or this company again. I advise others to do the same.

I used to go to Mojos all the time until I discovered Aloha Yogurt. They always have different flavors and the topics are fresh. I feel like I have far more choices here than I do other places. Staff is always friendly and immediately offer you samples when you walk in. I highly recommend Aloha if you want self serve yogurt!

I'm writing this review to specifically shout out Z! I'm usually very hesitant about going to Verizon stores due to sales tactics, but I was due for an upgrade. After waiting a bit, Z came over to help me. Not only did she not try to upsell me on a phone I didn't need, but she took the time to address all of my questions. I left with exactly the phone I needed and the only additional item I got was by my own choice.  Z is an example of what a salesperson should be. She understood my needs and got me exactly what I needed. You need more salespeople like her!

If you're looking for a cool bar to hang out at and play some games in the process, look no further! We went in and ordered some drinks. Prices are comparable to most bars on the strip. As long as you are drinking, you can play games for free at the bar. Selection isn't the widest (bar or machine wise) and they will not switch out the current game in the system.  Most of the bartenders were super friendly. Some of them looked like they'd rather be anywhere but there. They offer bottle service which allows you to play any console game you'd like all night. Cool idea but made me want to play other games even more.  They have a DJ at 10 pm but no one was really dancing. Music was great though and added to the overall atmosphere.   I would say add some variety to games offered and PLEASE get a few pinball machines! Beyond that, worth a trip if you are on Fremont Street.

China Jade has easily the best lunch and dinner specials in Scottsdale. It still doesn't hold a candle to Dragon Express down in Mesa (best Chinese in Arizona), but can't go wrong for the price. All the employees are friendly and they are pretty fast with orders. Absolutely check it out if you want some fat food Chinese that is above Panda Express.

I was a resident here for three years. When I first moved in, the staff was great! Although I did see some get less than favorable treatment, the staff seemed to like me from the get go. All was great for about a year or so. After that, the management started to turn over quickly. I believe the property owners changed and things went down hill. Some of the office staff was still friendly, but a few of them seemed to get an attitude. Fast forward to right before I moved out this year: the current staff there is mostly apathetic or very short with you when you come in. I wouldn't bother unless you need to pick up a package.   Let's talk about the complex itself. The area isn't that great. The price was okay for where it was, but you'll constantly see people digging through dumpsters. The apartment staff will drive right by someone doing it and not even say anything. Also, forget walking somewhere at night. The one time I did that, I was lucky I was in a group. We ran into some people that looked like they wanted to start something, but our numbers were larger, so they left us alone.  The parking situation is HORRIBLE. If you have people come and visit you, tell them they will be walking. Barely enough uncovered spots due to people with multiple cars. On top of that, if you have a space near the mailbox, prepare to deal with people parking in it weekly. There wasn't a week that went by where I didn't have someone in my space. Unless they've been there 24 hours, the office won't do anything for you. Do NOT forget to lock your car. I had my stuff stolen at least once as well as mail and packages when my mailbox wouldn't close properly.  The apartment itself: the appliances are old. I constantly dealt with the garbage disposal having food come up while I ran the dishwasher. Maintenance claimed this was because the wires were connected but refused to fix that or replace it. Maintenance is generally slow as well. When I first moved in, they left a note after entering and doing work. Now they don't tell you when they've come in to fix things. Neighbors were hit or miss. Some were really cool. Others were quite rude. Before I moved out, I noticed people were getting louder and louder throughout the complex. More parties were starting to happen and people with motorcycles seemed to race through with friends.  At least a few times a year the water and/or electricity cuts off in the complex. This can be down anywhere from several hours to a whole day. It's very inconvenient and there is no warning for when it will happen. When it does though, you'll see your neighbors outside complaining on their cell phones or looking around lost.   I ended up paying for damages because the apartment was not flexible with walk-through times and dates. Unless you are willing to take work off during the week to be there with them, they refuse to schedule them on weekends. Honestly, I'm happy to have paid and moved on. I liked how close I was to the freeway and neighboring towns (Tempe and Phoenix was a quick drive away). I was also near major restaurants as well as cool spots like Bookmans or Zia Records. I wish management had stayed the same throughout my time there. I feel the current staff is just there to collect a paycheck.  If you are the kind of person that really doesn't need much in the way of maintenance or service, this place is fine. For the location and things to do in the area, it's not bad. It would not be my first choice, but you may get lucky with your experience there.

I went here for the first time today with my fiance for lunch. I ordered the pesto chicken sandwich with a side of pasta salad. The sandwich was terrible! My chicken had a consistency of tuna like it had come out of a can. The pasta was also bland and had no seasoning whatsoever. For $20, I expected to get something at least half decent. Needless to say, we took a few bites and asked for a refund. I'd like to give them a second chance, but with places like Kneaders Bakery, I'm not going to bother.

Sa Bai On The Fly brings some much needed food variety to an area plagued with nothing but fast food. The woman at the front desk was very attentive and made us feel like valued customers. We ordered the Spring Rolls, Pad Thai and Spicy Pan Noodles. Everything came out promptly and tasted great. The chef even came out to ask us if we enjoyed the meal.  I'm happy to see new food options in the area. Especially a place that has good food. Prices were very reasonable and we got great portion sizes. Will definitely return!
