Yum, can you say great steak?  This is another of my father's favorite haunts after the car races at Manzanita.  Back in his day they did not serve alcohol and he and his racing cronies would bring their own bottles. My first trip here was over 40 years ago when they still had the stockyards next door.  Worst imaginable smell in the world greeted my nostrils when we got out of the car and rushed inside.  Once inside the only aroma was that of sizzling steak.  The stockyards are long gone but the steaks are still there.

The staff is friendly and knowledgable and the sales on stationary are always welcome.  Lots of specialty papers to purchase by the sheet or in packs of 25 or 50, with matching envelopes.  Oh so easy to give just the right touch to my correspondance.  Even when they are swamped with business the staff is always ready to lend a hand or help with a jammed machine.  When my puter is down I rent one of theirs for just $10 and hour with printing priveleges.

Normally AJ's is one of those places I have to avoid like the plague because it would be too easy for me to go bankrupt enjoying all they have to offer. The one exception to that is their truly fabulous made to order Sunday breakfast special...  Our Sunday morning treat is to have a made to order omelet.    Served from 9 am until noon on Sundays only this is an awesome deal:  only $5.95 for the hugest omelet ever and two sides.  Three of us at work share this monster.   I don't know how many eggs are in there but my guess is at least 6.  This heavenly concoction weighs in for at least a pound.  Eight inches long, five inches wide and three inches high.  We get it with everything but the kitchen sink; generous portions of two kinds of cheese, sausage, bacon, onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, asparagus and zuchinni.  Just writing this review is making me hungry (can't wait for Sunday to be here!).  This awesome veggie and egg extraveganza pairs ever so nicely with a double side of the most mouth watering scalloped potatoes to ever grace a plate.  I don't know what is in them but I could probably put a way of gallon of these all on my own they are so divine!  If you find this place as tantalizing as I do, leave your plastic at home and just bring a ten dollar bill; you will be glad you did.

Always a great selection.  This store is always full of wonderful surprises and great sales.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  One of my favorite getaways when I have a few hours to enjoy the shopping experience.  Creativity gets a big helping hand here.  Lots of classes too.

I love that they always have those chocolate mints at the register.  My fav is the tapanade (consistantly the best anywhere) and the greek salad.    The wait staff is always friendly and patient.  No probs with ordering to go.  There are coupons available on Restaurant.com for this place.  Save more money by trying the lunch specials.

All the luxury you crave when in Vegas without the heart stopping bill.    Why bother going into Vegas when you can have all the glamour right here in Henderson without all the crowds? Whether I am staying here or not, the buffet here is the first and last place I hit when going to Vegas. I can not say enough good things about this buffet.  REALLY!  I am a buffet snob.  I love buffets but I hate canned crap.  I want great food and lots of it.  I am indesisive so buffets are my style. This one is HUGE.  About 2000 sq feet of just food, the dining area adds another 2000 sq. feet.   Assuming it is dinner time we will be Starting on the right where we begin with Asian fare; all the most popular dishes (about 12).  Next is the Mongolian BBQ style area, pick your meats and veggies and the chef whips them up in front of you.  Move on over to the Mexican food area for about a half dozen of your most popular dishes including hand made tortillas at the taco bar, enchiladas, chile realleno, etc.  Now, we venture over to Italian (about 6 entrees plus pizza), my son's fav is next; seafood.  I think they outdo themselves here.  The obligatory fried and breaded white fish & chips & fried shrimp are out shone by stuffed mussells, shrimp scampi, stuffed blue crab and salmon filets.  My brother opts for the Prime rib sliced to order.  Want it thick rather than wafer thin?  No prob.  He had his 1/2 inch thick.  On a diet?  Have the roast turkey or ham followed up or proceded by the gargantuan salad bar.  Nothing canned here, all fresh.  Trying to keep Kosher?  They have a small section of that also. End your meal in the seperate dessert area complete with a large selection of sugar free dessert in addition to the kid's favorite; the sundae bar and soft serve ice cream.  I'll have some cheese cake please. After the stomach numbing gorge at the buffet, mosey on over to the casino and shuffle off the kiddies to the great play area (arcade) and movie theatre.  A three story shopping mall attaches to the resort so while you play golf or gamble the wife and young'ns can be out of your hair.  Or, send your better half off to thier amazing spa for some r & r.  If you chose to stay here (highly recommended): Every room is luxuriously appointed with down comforters, down pillows and fiber filled ones too, comfy terry cloth robes (just in case you forgot yours) and exceptional free goodies in additon to some unusual pay as you use em stuff.  The bathrooms are like a private spa with overlarge seperate tubs and showers.  Even the potty has it's own little room complete with a phone. The entire place is decorated in antique reproduction furniture with plenty of marble and decorative wrought iron.  It all comes together for a warm and friendly experience worth repeating over and over again!

I went here for the first time to honor my father after he died.  This was one of his long standing favorite haunts for good Mexican food.  I was NOT disappointed and could see immediately why he loved this place.  Come as you are; be in dressed to the nines or in your favorite worn to a frazzle blue jeans.  Just be sure to bring a big appetite because the food is tasty and plentiful.  Prices are very reasonable.  I had the chile relleno - very good.  Chips were thin, crisp and hot and never ending without having to ask for refills.  The ambience is fun and fabulous.  The decor is something right out of a sumptuous Mexican hacienda.  If you have never been to Mexico but would like the feel of  being there then this is the place.  Intimate rooms for a cozy tete a tete, large rooms designed to accomodate the largest banquet or charming out door seating plus a very friendly bar area.  Whatever type of dining experience you crave Tia Rosa's can accomodate you.  The wait staff was very attentive and the food and Margaritas were amazingly delicious!

Hey!  I may be almost as round as I am tall (short, actually) but I do crave well made and fashionable clothing that neither looks like an embellished gunny sack or something out of Grandma's closet.  Why is it that most clothing manufacturers think that once you reach a certain size or age you no longer want to look pretty?   This store has everything a plus size girl or woman could ever want and more.  Except for shoes.  No shoes here.   Be you Petite, average height or tall; if you are plus size this is the place to shop at.  The staff is extremely nice and very helpful.  I have never walked into this store and been greeted by anything but sincere smiles and positive attitudes.  The clothing is very good quality so it won't fall apart , shrink or grow when washed or worn a few times or a few seasons.  Hallelujah!  There is always a large selection of clothing and accessories  on clearance and all the latest fashions by the best plus size designers are available.  Absolutely the best selection of downright gorgeous  bras with matching panties of anywhere in town.  Yes, they also have the old standbys (Playtex) too.  This is most notable because when you desire a sexy bra and you wear anyting larger than a 36D the pickings are usually quite slim.  Not here though.  If you are at all unsure as to your true bra size they do fittings. One side of the store is casual wear and the other is business and formal attire with a large lingerie area in the back of the store.  Come back often as the selection changes weekly with new items going on clearance regularly.  If you are a plus size gal or know one point her over to Catherines; she will thank you for it.

The produce at this store is always very very nice and reasonably priced.  There is a very disagreeable smell in the meat department so I don't buy anything from the meat or fish department.  The pet supply area has a good selection.  The frozen food selection is very small.  The video department has been replaced by a machine; kinda cool.  The bakery is a bit of an afterthought.  What a shame.  The store at 75th and Cactus (which they closed) was much better.

I love grocery stores!  The first test is the smell.  This one always smells good.  The store is well organized and the staff if very friendly and helpful.  They must take happy pills because they are always chipper and have a ready smile.  The produce looks nice (but sometimes it can be a little pricy).  The sales are great and the end caps usually have a bargain worthy of stocking up on.

This is a fun grocery store when you have lots of time to just wander around and take it all in.  The produce and meat departments are a bit small but the deli area is very good.  The frozen food and specialty foods areas are very extensive.  Lots of health food alternatives that you don't see elsewhere.  The butchers in the meat department are awesome!  They showed me how to de-shell and prepare raw shrimp and gave me cooking advice all with big smiles on their faces.  What a pleasure.  With the expanded housewares/garden/hardware/toys/gifts areas this truly can be a one stop shopping experience. One of the few stores that allows for self checkout; fun for the kids.

The staff in the mini mart is always friendly.  Lowest cigarette prices in the area.  Ask about the discount basket.  The gas bays are always clean and functioning.  Nice flower pots at the pumps.  Restrooms are well maintained.  Don't forget the drive thru car wash complete with hand drying by Jorge.  He is awesome.  Never leaves a streak or drop of water on your car.  He even wipes down your tires!  Best $5 car wash in town.

This is all American food.  I'm calling it Ethnic, because American is an ethnic group too and they don't have a fast food grouping.  Hey!  I'm a California girl; we love our burgers the In & Out way.  Always fresh, always made to order and always made right.   Drive through or dine in.  The drive through is surprisingly fast.  The inside dining gets crowded at meal times but it usually works out that by the time your food is ready a table opens up.  On a nice day there are plenty of outside tables to take advantage of.  Kid friendly dining with lots of high chairs.  They keep it pretty clean even when it's busy.   Best fries on the planet because they are made ultra fresh right before your eyes.  Watch the guy take a  fresh potatoe and slice it and then fry it.  I like mine extra well done.  Not a problem at I&O.  They make it the way you want it.    Add on grilled onions with or without your slice of raw onion.  No prob. Full slices of onions (none of those dehydrated minced things that look like lice on your burger), rich ripe red tomatoes (not pink; red and ripe)and whole leaves of lettuce (none of that shredded stuff with brown edges).  The buns are baked fresh everyday too.  Fresh, fresh, fresh and juicy.  On a diet?  In and Out invented the protein burger over 40 years ago.  All the other fast food places are imitators.  In California we called it a Rabbit Burger.  All your burger goodies stacked on whole lettuce leaves and lovingly wrapped.  Messy and yummy.  Animal Style - it's not on the menu but you can make your burger or fries Animal Style - adds grilled onions and more condiments. On your fries it adds cheese, onions and thousand island sauce - Wow!  They (unfortunately) charge extra for it now.  Oh well, if you tell em to leave off the cheese they will not charge the extra $1.85 on to the fries though.  Top off your meal with a real made from ice cream shake.  Everyone else has finally followed suit on this one too.  Used to be you could only find ice milk being used.  I & O always used ice cream and still does.  Nice fat straws too - not those skinny ones that you have to suck your brains out to get a good slurp.  Pick up a cool t shirt and bumper sticker while you are there and show your burger love to the world!  Dang!  I've made myself hungry writting this reveiw.  Think I will head on over for some comfort food!   Sunday through Thursday 10:30 a.m.-1:00 a.m. Friday and Saturday 10:30 a.m.-1:30 a.m.

Buyer Beware!  Even if they recommend a product and it is the wrong one they will NOT take it back or exchange it.  EVER!  Not even if you never opened it.  Very rude staff. My daughter and I went to D&I and told the clerk that we needed an attachment tool for my drill to twist wire.  The gripper on my drill was not small enough to be able to grasp my wire.  Our wire was not your typical round wire but square.  When it is twisted it makes a very cool serpentine effect that is stunning when crafting jewelry.  The sales girl said they did not have an attachment for our drill but they did have a "Jump ring maker" that would do the job.  We purchased it and took it home.  At home I further researched our needs and realized that this jump ring maker was NOT what we wanted.  We never opened the box.  We attempted to return it the very next day and were told no refunds, no exchanges.  Period.  We tried writing to the owner via email and got the same response; no refunds, no exchanges.    I find it funny how the owner of this store and his employees continue to lie to defend themselves.   They have concocted an elaborate lie about my wanting to make a ridiculous amount of jump rings.  Suposedly for a window display in my salon.  sounds like that would be a very modern looking display and my salon decor was NOT modern.   Once again,   I tried to return the jump ring maker  the very next day because it was NOT what I needed to twist wire.  The box was not even opened, so how could I have made 60,000 jump rings with it.  What the heck would I need 60K jumps rings for?   I NEVER wanted to make jump rings and I never have.  He knows it.  He continues to lie about the experience I had with his store 3 years ago.  Every year he trots out his libelous accusations and personal slurs towards me.   How sad.
