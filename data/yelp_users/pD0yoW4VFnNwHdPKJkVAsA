Been going to this place for years. It's cheap, delicious and consistent. It's a guilty pleasure for sure. This place needs to be ranked higher it's the best Long Wongs to share the name in the Valley.

Cheaper Greek food than My Big Fat and tastier. Recommend the Greek fries (feta and lemon juice) and the Spartan club. Nice patio seating too. One of my favorite places in the area.

When asking for an extra tortilla for my fajitas they gladly gave me one and charged me an extra 2.50 without telling me. 2.50 for a tortilla after paying $15 for a fajita plate. That's pretty steep. And without saying a thing when inquiring. BS

My favorite coffee spot in Phoenix. I may be biased because its the closest one to my house, but nonetheless, the services is awesome and so is the coffee!

Amazing! I got the Shredded Pork which I believe is their house specialty. I had the casserole and mashed potatoes as my sides. The food was really creative and not your run of the mill Mexican. I def plan on going back soon.

Better than Starbucks. That's all I got, but its enough. Check it out if the yuppies don't scare you away.

Right across from Rips. Perfect for after drinking food. 2 burgers and fries and drinks for 15 is pretty good. Very friendly service. One complaint is the burger meat wasn't the best but the toppings make up for it. I'll come back.  Update: This place closed. Disregard above :(
