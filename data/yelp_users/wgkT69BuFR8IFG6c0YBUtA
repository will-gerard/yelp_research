We went here for my birthday dinner with some friends and loved it!!  Food was great and server was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. Will be going back there is a lot more on their menu I want to try!

This location is awful! I used to go here and food was good it slowly started to go south so I stopped going. The other day I decided to give it another try heck it has been at least 4 years maybe they have improved?  BAD idea!! They have since tore down the wall that provided a the little bit of privacy it had to have a now open disorganized caf√© look. Service was horrible and the food was disgusting and way overpriced. The only good part was my beer. Will not give another chance this place needs to just be a bar. Maybe use the dining area portion as a dance floor.

My husband and I have used this body shop for our Kia Forte multiple times in the last couple years. Alfredo and his team are the best!! They are honest and professional and I would recommend them to anyone that needs body work done.

Love this place since it has opened we have eaten there at least once a week. We are newbies when it comes to Thai food so I really have nothing to compare it to.  The people are friendly, the food is GOOD and the place is CLEAN!!! We have tried multiple menu items and have like them all so far!
