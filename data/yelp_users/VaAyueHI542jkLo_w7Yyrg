Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe has the authenticity of Japan's finest "Mom & Pop" eateries.  This effect is achieved by trasporting diners to a quaint interior with friendly service and delicious food the moment the enter from the low scale strip mall exterior.  The Ramen with Pork Cutlett (chashu ramen) is superb as are many of their other Asian dishes and even their italian fare is done with care and skill.  Sometimes the servers aren't the best in terms of knowledge and attentiveness, but the quality of food, affordable price and friendly atmosphere make up for it.

Overpriced, Terrible service!  I've been a long time customer of this chain, but I won't be going back!   For a long time I was happy to pay the high price for a great pie, but on a recent trip the poor service left a sour taste which has prompted me to visit the MANY other great pizza joints in the neighborhood.    The manager was short, snarky and seemed to be put out to have me come pick my pizza up for take out.  When I called from a friend's phone and told him I didn't have my phone but that I was a previous customer and gave him my number, he said he would just drop the pizza at my house and charge my credit card if I didn't show up.   When I did show up and had a beer with friends while waiting he had the audacity to make a comment that if our intoxication became a problem he would have to ask us to leave.

I was contacted by NYPD management who took the time to assist in resolving my previous issues.  It's still a bit pricey, but it is quality.  They have resolved the service issue and on my subsequent visit I was very pleased on all accounts.

I've lived half a block away for more than a year and while doing a u-turn in the strip mall I saw the sign, which jogged some distant memory of somebody mentioning "Bertha's".     We've only been there once and had the Waffles with mixed fruit and whipped cream and an Egg Sandwich with roasted tomato, pesto and arugula.  YUM YUM YUM!    The place is modest and welcoming.  The food is fantastic and priced incredibly reasonably.  I'm so happy that I've found my neighborhood breakfast place and can't wait to go back again and again!
