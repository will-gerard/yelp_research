I have only been to this location a couple times, but every time I have my food has been cold and hard. I do love carls jr and have never had an issue with this other than at this location. Though my fries came out hot, my chicken sandwich would have shattered if I threw it at the wall. Lol for $8 I would hope it would be a little more fresh! Come on carls jr!! You can do better than that! :)

Absolutely love this salon!! I have been there two times since I moved back here and both times I was extremely satisfied with my visit! The ladies are very nice! They don't pressure you for anything you don't want, which is nice! The pedicures are amazing! I felt like the massage was extra long both times for no additional cost! That's my favorite part of a pedicure :) .. This is definitely where I'll be going for nails from now on!! It was only $35 for an amazing pedicure (with sugar scrub!) and an eyebrow wax! Can't beat that.
