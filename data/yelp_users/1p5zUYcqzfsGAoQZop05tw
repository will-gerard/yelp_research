on 8/16/11 at 7:45 PM I took cab 142 from the airport to my residence.  I entered the cab the driver asked where I wanted to go.  I explained to my residence, but that it would be best if I driected him along the way.  I said "best to take 202 off at Priest to Galvin up Galvin to McDowell."  He said, "OH a Short Fare!"  I said "Excuse me? I always make the minimum as stated on your window and if my money is not good in your cab, you can let me out and I will be happy to take another vehicle?"  He mumbled under his breath..I expalined that I take a cab weekly to and from the airport and that I am more than happy to find someone else...He said, "It must cost you a lot of money to take cabs you should drive."  I arrived home, had to get my own bags out of the vehicle and I called your dispatch to complain.  I was told Managers were not in, however that someone would contact me on 8/17/11 in the morning.  I have not received a call.  I called back to dispatch asking to speak with the supervisor and the gentleman on the phone said "If you didn't hear back, its because we are too busy."  I asked to speak to anyone else, he said "They are too busy to talk to you."  I said I would be happy to hold.  He placed me on hold and after a few minutes I found that AAA Cab has a comment section on their website and decided to contact them there instead.  If you have issues with them I highly suggest that you complain as well.  Had I been a visitor to the area this would have been one of my first encounters with a service in the area.  Not a sparkling review by any means.  If you have a chance to take a different cab I would suggest that you do so.  I use Clean Aire Cab frequently and adore them!  Unfortunately, they are not allowed to pick up from the airport which keeps horrible companies like this in business!

Awesome! Absolutely awesome! I found DeAnna on Groupon and I have stayed ever since. The salon is clean and modern.  She does an amazing gel manicure and is exceptionally affordable. Great conversation and she focuses all of her energy on her client sitting in front of her 100% of the time. She doesn't interrupt your mani or pedi by taking phone calls and booking other appointments. Having said that, if you are trying to book a first time appointment with her, leave a message, she is very good at returning calls to schedule you. However, she isn't available while working with her clientele. She is the shop owner and the only person doing nails at the salon. Worth the wait for sure!! She has stylists at the salon doing hair and they are fabulous as well. I can't say enough good things about her!  Call and schedule you will not be disappointed.

I love this company!  They are clean, courteous, kind and professional.  I would tell you that if you ever have an opportunity to call a cab in the Phoenix area to use them.  Unfortunately, you will not be able to take one of their cabs from the airport..which is awful beacuse it allows horrible cab companies like AAA the ability to leave a horrific first impression with our area visitors.  Clean Air Cab all the way!

Love Leigh and Don at Salon Ivy.  100% salon without the snobby approach of Scottsdale.  Great service and super stylists.  Leigh and Don are awesome!
