Hmmm - for 5 stars - a place needs to a) have great drinks b) have great service...and for extra credit - c) also provide great ambience (yes - that is the correct spelling - sc*** you yelp spell checker).    Parasol Up - Parasol Down delivers on a) b) and c). The drinks are OUTSTANDING. I tried the muddled cucumber (cucumber topped with ginger beer (non alcoholic) and the grapefruit strawberry collins. Both were amazing.   The view overlooks a giant indoor pool with a waterfall inside the WYNN. Could not ask for a better view. Will definitely go back.

Rudest dispatcher ever...maybe he was having a bad day. Had to cancel my order half way. Not going to use them again. UPDATE to review: I noticed that as soon as a 1 star review is posted (and there are several yelpers who got this rude treatment), there are a few 5 star ones that showed up. Look at the USERS who post those 5 star reviews - they have ZERO connections on yelp - and all they do is boost up reviews of these SUCKY companies.  Yelp - please take note.
