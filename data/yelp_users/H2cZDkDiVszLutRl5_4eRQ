Only stayed here for one night, but I wish it was for more. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, always trying to anticipate your needs. The rooms are nicely appointed, but as compared with other Ritz's this one is on the lower end.  The common areas were the best. Very luxurious and the lobby and lounge area were very relaxing to be in. There is a pool, but no hot tub. We were able to use the fire pit area which is very nice and comfortable. We did not use the fitness center but it looked nice and the business center was state of the art with both MACs and PCs.  We only had one issue while we were there, and thus the reason for the minus one star. Our keys were deactivated by the computer at the front desk in the middle of our stay. We know that it was not because we kept them near our phones because they all went out at the same time. A trip to the front and it was resolved.  This location is convenient for business purposes in the area. $29 overnight parking is tough, but there is a neighborhood nearby you can park at after 5pm if you want to risk it.

This place is a gem! It offers separate restaurants for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Came here on a Sunday for brunch which ends at 1pm. You just have to be seated by then, and from what we noticed, a few came in after that and were able to be seated.  That being said, it would be tough for a wheelchair or elderly people to make it to the brunch restaurant. It is all the way in the back of the property and the parking lot is across the street. The rest of the trek is gravel and dirt.  Everything they serve here comes from the property you are at. You can truly taste the freshness and your body will thank you. I had the chorizo scramble and it was excellent. A very filling meal, the flavors were vibrant and the atmosphere wonderful. For drinks, they have a self serve, station with lemonade, teas, coffees, etc. The speed of te service was excellent and very courteous.  This is a great place for groups or a couple to dine!

Came here for one night only and could not have been happier. The staff was extremely nice and the room spacious. They did not have an upgrade for me as a Gold member so they put me in a room with a patio and favorable view right off of one of the tee boxes. The front desk clerk walked us over to the elevator and pushed the button for us!  Our suite was huge, with a living room with pullout, small kitchenette, and refrigerator. The decor was just okay, nothing too special. The bathroom had both a tub and a stand up shower with a rain bath head. There were also dual sinks in the bathroom. The bedroom had its own TV and an iHome clock.  The pool was a bit small, and is only 4 ft. deep at its deepest point, so perfect for kids. The staff here was also great, getting us fresh hot towels! The chairs could use some updating but I won't complain too much.  As Gold Elite, we got one free breakfast which include meat and an omelet station. The seating area is right off the lobby so it is very convenient. There is also a large patio with lots of seating and a fire pit, overlooking the pool and golf course.  The most amazin part was the free parking. A place like this could easily charge for it (don't get an ideas Marriott), but they don't. Great family hotel!

There are a handful of restaurants right on the park and this is one of them. We were attracted to the outdoor seating on a beautiful day. There is more seating outdoors than in and the inside feels more like a bar, with TVs playing sports. We came around 2:30pm and surprisingly had to wait for a table. Once seated, the staff began service that was quite friendly, but as the meal went on, we got less and less attention and an apathetic attitude. I don't think it was anything we did. Our party of 4 each got entrees and shared an appetizer.  I had the chicken wings mild which were quite weak. They make them crunchy here which is something I like but I wish I had gotten the hot ones. Mild just didn't do it for me. The lines for the bathroom were long and there were most certainly non customers using them. There is one bathroom for each gender that is a one-person-at-a-time kind. For a place that is named Euro Pizza, none of us got pizza, which should tell you something...

Came here before an ASU football game and it was packed. The service was poor (slow, order came out wrong). Not sure if it was because of the volume of people or not, but management should staff more employees in anticipation of this on game days.  The food is nothing special and the prices average. The only positive aspec tis the atmosphere. It is partially outdoors and brightly decoratedon the inside.

My first convenient store/gas station review. I had been told about this place by a friend and it lived up to the hype. First off, the gas area is large and not crowded like other gas stations.  Once inside, the display of food and drink was amazing. There were a ton of different hot dog options, taquitos, and other hot bites. The buns are kept warm down below. As for the drinks, there are 2 walls with everything you can imagine such as milkshakes, smoothies, fancy coffee flavors, etc.  The service was great and there is a lotto machine in the corner. Again, even the inside did not feel cramped. It was nice and modern. The only reason this is not 5 stars is because there were no onions as a condiment option for your hot dogs!

First time dining in a nice restaurant inside of a Vegas hotel, so I didn't quite know what to expect. Would there be slot machines at our table?  I was pleasntly surprised by Circo. First of all, have a reservation. We went there on a Saturday night and couldn't get in until 10pm without a reservation. And we were lucky to be able to do that.  Most of the tables here had a view of the water outside of the Bellagio. You could watch the water show from here.  On to the food. Excellent. And it better be for what you pay, but the service is top notch. Our glasses were never even close to empty and the spacing between when the server would visit your table was just right (not too often).  MAKE A RESERVATION!!!!

We all know about the Bellagio, and so my story is that this is one of those places I've always wanted to stay, but never gotten around to it for some reason or another. Well, I finally had the chance and was not disappointed.  We had a standard room was on the 21st floor. There is someone verifying keys 24/7 so that only guests are allowed up the elevator. Same goes for the pool area, and they scan your key there, not just look at it. The rooms themselves are roomy, with controls on the wall for the drapes. It had an IHome Ipod dock that doubled as the clock. The bathroom was large with a separate tub and stand up shower.  The casino area is nice and there are some things to look at in the hotel. The restaurant selection is decent. The minus one star is for the fact that the room had a tube TV, I would have expected a flatscreen at least!

New Favorite Lunch spot in Vegas! The service is friendly and the views gorgeous if you get the right table. The start you off with a bevy of breads and crackers with their tapenades...oh so good.  The BEST Carpaccio I've never had. It is $18, but you get a ton of meat and the dish could certainly stand alone as a meal. For our mains, we had the flatbreads. One was a fig and prosciutto and the other the Italian, with all the staples and grilled perfectly. The size was decent as well and we had leftovers to take.  On a Sunday, it was not hard to get a table and one with a view to boot. Highly recommend this place!

When in a rush and just wnat good food at a cheap (for Vegas) price, this is the place. It is behind the Casino in the Paris and has many different crepe options. Whether in the mood for sweet or savory, this place has you covered.  I got the savory crepe with prosciutto and it was delicious. The prosciutto was salty, but htat's the way I like it. It was ready in about 10 minutes and we were back at the tables within 25 minutes of ordering.  There is a cafeteria style area to eat right next door and is a good area for people watching.

This isn't the biggest club in Vegas, but it offers a good crowd and a decent experience. The night we went we arrived around 11pm. We were staying at the Bellagio so we were able to bypass the line fairly quickly. Note, our group was an equal amount of guys and girls.  Once inside, you are on the second level and have to drop down to the dance floor. With our group, we were able to create a little of bit of breathing room to dance. The DJ was good and the go-go dancers were okay.  There is a decent amount of space around the top to look down and the bouncers are not super rude like at other Vegas Clubs. I would return!

This review is also just for the golf course. This course is nice and wide open. The fairways are wide, but there are lots of bunkers. The course winds through a vacation home community and has water stops all along the way. The carts are decent and the surroundings nice.  We weren't allowed to rive in the native lands but we fortunately did not need to too often. We booked online and got a voucher for a free hot dog and drink at the turn. There was also a popping pool party going on with a DJ that we could hear and see from one of the holes on the back 9. Would have loved to have jumped in a pool right after the round.

This review is for the Casino only. Came here late night for some cheap gamblings. It is in a great location right on the corner so the access was easy. The smoke smell is strong and the servers slow. I realize it's cheap gambling, but O'Sheas is way better!  There is a poker room and on a Saturday night had 3 tables going, with a minimum $40 to $200 buy in. The other tables were packed and there is even a section of tables where there are go-go dancers dancing for you (they are horrible by the way).  This place also features electronic Craps. You make your bets on a screen, but there are real dice with real rollers, a great way to learn. Drais after hours club is also here, so once that gets going, the line for the club stretches into the casino and makes it even more crowded in that area. In a pinch, it gets the job done.

Another great spring training facility. This park is home to the Texas Rangers and Kansas City Royals. This is a newer park with decent bathrooms. The concessions and all of the staff are nice and competent. The lawn area is great and the bullpen access is good, even you are higher up than at some of the other parks. They sill still throw you some balls though.  Parking is free of course and the park has that midwest small town feel to it. Don't be fooled by the maps though, this park is far off the freeway and way out there if you're coming from Phoenix.

We had a 6 hour layover in Phoenix with 2 kids and found this place. It is accessible by light rail so we did not need car seats to get our kids here. They normally close at 4pm, but were open from 5-9pm on this Friday because it was the first Friday of the month. We got there right at 5pm and thankfully so because when we left at 6:15 or so, there was a line around the building (since it was a free admission night).  The staff are extremely friendly and the facilities are top notch. There are different areas encouraging both sciences and pretend play. There is a special "shoe-free" toddler area which was great because the bigger kids are not allowed in there. My 3 year old liked the grocery store and kitchen rooms and also the noodle area that you can walk through. I wish we had this in Dallas!

This club is just like any other Vegas club. Long lines, crowded, and dark. That being said, there are some distinguishing factors about Lavo. If you eat at the restaurant, you gain entrnace for free and skip the line.  Once in, the club is inviting. There are many places for the ladies to get up and dance. The bottle service area is accessible and not some elusive club area, it is easy to mingle with those folks. There were people of all kinds, ages, etc. Security keeps things moving and helps you out whenever possible.

Talk about making healthy food fun and tasty, this place does just that. It is an upscale casual, and is on the pricey side for casual, but you are paying for your health. The dishes are all sourced from local farmers and you can taste it. Even for someone that is not used to eating healthy, there are things on the menu for them.  I had the burger for example, which is bison meat. It was every but as juicy as a beef burger and had a great kick to it. They have all kinds of foods, including tacos and Thai dumplings, which I had for an appetizer. These were decent, but not the best.  The service was great and the outdoor area is well heated with lamps on those cold nights. Oh, and their kale is the best here, a great place to introduce someone to it!

One of the newer parks for spring training, this one has it all. You have good access to players via the bullpen areas and a great view of them warming up. You can feel the speed from those pitches. They'll throw you balls pretty often.  There is plenty of grass seating not only in the outfield, but a little section in each corner down the 1st and 3rd baselines. The concessions are a plenty although the workers seem to be a bit slow. That is the only thing keeping this place form being a 5 star.  The players leave to the corners of the field so camp yourself out there if you want autographs and such. You can't go wrong with Camelback Ranch!

This place is great for Bachelor Parties, and as I would imagine, anything else a well. We had a 4 bedroom suite that was really one suite that has 3 adjoining rooms.  As mentioned, there was a huge projection screen, and all of the amenities were nice. it even had your name on the screen (at least the name of the person who booked the reservation) everytime you turned on the TV.  There were plenty of towels, soaps, and shampoos for our two night stay and service was never an issue. There was a full kitchen which did not have an oven however, which made it difficult to cook our frozen pizzas late night.  All in all a great place and I would definitely stay here again!

The food here is pricey, but well worth it. The sides are served family style so you may only need two or three for the whole table. The steaks are perfectly cooked and the cuts of meat are the best of quality.  This particular location offers a cool area to sit in if you are fortunate enough to be seated there. It is a pod-like structure that is in the middle of the hotel atrium. It feels very cool and adds to the experience.  If you are looking to go big, this is a great place to do it!

On our drive over to Phoenix from LA, this was a perfect stop for all. Of course it's cheap and filling, but the best part is that they serve breakfast all day. I had the Country Boy breakfast and it was amazing. Tons of food all for $8.99. I had the sirloin steak, but in hindsight, probably should have gotten the country fried steak. The sirloin was a bit tough and over cooked, even I asked for medium.  Lots of food and fairly quick for a sit down restaurant, this place had great service and is a treat on road trips!

Came here on a Sunday morning and there was a sizeable crowd, but not too crowded. It was a colder day, so not a lot of people sitting outside. Our group of 4 was able to find a table in the back corner after ordering our crepes. There was a much larger group seated already so this place can definitely handle groups.  I had the Philly crepe and the banana nutella crepe. For the price, it can't be beat. I think they have a small kitchen and thus the wait can be long. $7 for all savory crepes and $6 for sweet, the wait is worth it. The service is great and this street is cool, being inside of an old house. Parking was easy. The scene is definitely hipster.

Came here for the first time on a Saturday night. It was packed and the wait was about 45 minutes for a party of 6. We were seated outside and it was a warm night, so we didn't need heat lamps.  Once seated the service was sub par. For instance, our server took my tea for a refill and never brought it back. In addition, we ordered a bunch of personal pizzas and she said that their oven was small and suggested we get large pizzas half and half if we wanted our food in a reasonable time. We obliged and it still took over 30 minutes to get our food!Sounds like they need a bigger kitchen.  The pizza itself was decent, nothing special. We had some leftover and they wrapped it is tin foil and gave it to us, no box or anything! I don't think we'll be returning.
