We love Mucho taco!! The owner is great and always makes sure to take care of us when we stop in. The mole chicken special is our favorite! This place is a small authentic restaurant but delivers a huge explosion of mexican flavor!!

Waited 35 mins for partly wrong order, red jade chicken was over cooked. Had a full restaurant of waiting people. Somethings going wrong in that kitchen. Equivalent to fast food except for the wait. Should've went to original in PHX.

We Love Hula's! Our purpose is to visit every Tiki restaurant and bar in every city! All the Trader Vic's,( we have Hala Kahiki in our home state), Mister Tiki, Bali Hai, Kon Tiki, Mai Kai and plenty of others. We know TIki!!  We know Mai Tais and We know Great Food!  Hula's has it all!   We loved the atmosphere, the MunkTiki mugs everywhere. We appreciated every element of the place. (Especially Gilligan's Island projected on the wall above the bar!) The owner Chris impressed us with his hospitality and knowledge of the Tiki World. We were only in Phoenix for 3 days and we went there twice!! After having mediocre $10 Mai Tai's at Trader Vic's Scottsdale, we were quite pleased to sit on the patio next to the fire pit and enjoy $7 mai tais that actually tasted like they should. We tried every damn drink on the menu!!  So then it was time to eat! Calamari was fantastic, Coconut Shrimp Rolls were the "bomb" and Ahi Tuna Wontons rocked our palates!! Island Poke and Spicy Seaweed Salad were great too! No, we didnt eat this all in one night! We told you we went there two nights in a row!! :)  Great Cocktails!! Great Food!! Great Service!! You've gotta try it!!  We will be Back!!!!!!

I love Nourish! Yes, it may not be the easiest place to get to, but the building it's in, is awesome. I admire the Optima Camelview every time I drive past it. Next, Nourish is small and not very fancy but so what? The menu is confusing because of all the color coded dots, but the options are fabulous! My husband is an amazing chef and he can make me these dishes at home, but who wants to constantly eat at home?? I'm just surprised at all the tough reviews for Nourish. I thought the food was great, very clean tasting and no, I wasnt full when I left. You are supposed to eat for fuel not for full, am I right?  This is a great little establishment for some fantastic allergy-free food. Hence the name "Nourish" , I would say the name is fitting.  I say definitely give it a try if you have any dietary restrictions or if you just want some really clean, good for your gut and soul, food. Oh yes, and the mojito was one of the best I've had in the Valley!! Ill be back soon!

Get the quesadilla sampler for sure!! When we first pulled up into the lot, we saw they had a drive thru and we almost left because it looked dumpy. Im glad we decided to try it because it was awesome. Had a little bit of a wait for our food, but it was worth it! Don't judge a book by its cover on this one!!
