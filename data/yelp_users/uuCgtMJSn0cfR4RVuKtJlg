Received an email after placing my order online stating a 38 minute delivery time. After an hour I called the restaurant only to be told there was a problem and my order could not be processed. There was no effort made to contact me and no apologies offered. Manager of the store was "too busy" to get on the phone and discuss with me. In a city with many choices when it comes to pizza delivery, Pizza Hut has lost a costumer.

Such a wonderful spot to meet friends for drinks or dinner! The food is spot on and the indoor/outdoor bar area creates the ideal vibe. Perfectly located in the Quarter  right next to the parking garage.
