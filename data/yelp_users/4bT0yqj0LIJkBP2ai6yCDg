There is $5 parking available on the corner of Washington and 2nd St. Must have cash.

I bought a Groupon for 2 adults for the Arizona Science Center. It was my first visit and I was eager to see the Lost Egypt exhibit. We paid for our son separately. I was a little disappointed with the Lost Egypt exhibit but overall, we had a really great time. My son has been before. He is 10 and loved it. There is an additional fee for IMAX and the Planetarium... Plus, you'll have to pay for parking. However, the parking can be discounted with validation AND the food in The Lab Cafe was reasonably priced. This is a great place for kids. I

We only went to Grazie because we had a Groupon. This was the filthiest restaurant I have ever been too. Every table was COVERED with dirty dishes and food. Our pizza was horrible. I would have rather had a frozen pizza at home. Never again.  I am sorry for the harsh review but it was really that bad.

I love this place.  The staff is amazing and the vibe is cool.  The private tasting area is pretty sweet too.  There are always a lot of great events happening here. I will be back many times!

This church is great.  The message is something I can relate to and the music is fantastic.  The Peoria campus is huge!!  If you are looking for a smaller experience you may want to visit one of the other locations.  Message is via video for most services.

Service sucks. Everyone who works here has an attitude and is not accommodating!!!! Olive Garden tastes better then the food they serve here. Deals are also misleading. Save your money and go elsewhere.

I love Gordon Biersch but especially love this location. The staff is friendly and very attentive. The private event space is fantastic.   I have dined here many times and have never been disappointed. I have also used the private event space for a number of events. This space in particular is great for a large group of 30+ people. Thank you Gordon Biersch for a wonderful experience. I will continue to come back again and again.

This is a gorgeous park and is perfect when looking to get outdoors. This is not a park where you can bring a stroller with all-terrain tires. I'll be back when my child is older and he can ride in his hiking back-pack.   The staff was helpful in assisting me to find a trail that might work for the two of us. I really appreciated that. We ultimately just ended up walking the paved road and still enjoyed our day in the park!

I love Focal Point. Wendi does such a fantastic job coloring and cutting my hair. I always feel fabulous when I leave.   The salon is always clean and the staff is always friendly. I love the included hand and arm massage and the wine too!  Thank you Focal Point!

Friendly service and great food! We couldn't happier. We will definitely come here again and again and again.   Bottomless spaghetti with meat sauce tonight for only $8.99! Yum! One of my favorites. Thanks Peaks & Valleys Restaurant for a great evening.

Thanks Peaks & Valleys Restaurant for a great evening.

We love this venue.  Its a little treasure in Cave Creek.  Don't let the "Coffeehouse" sign fool you.  They have a large selection of beer and wine.  The patio is amazing too.

Found this gem on Yelp and absolutely love it. We love the "Drunken" Noodles and Coconut Soup. They are a couple of our favorite dishes and have always been pretty consistent in taste. Dine in or take out! The staff is extremely attentive and very nice. We have recommended this restaurant to our friends and will continue to come back.

My sandwich was good but the dining room was filthy and disgusting. There was not a single table that was clean and the floor beneath them was just as filthy. Staff needs to clean the dining room more often. If the public dining space is that filthy, I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like.

We didn't enjoy our lunch today. We waited nearly 45 minutes for a couple of sandwiches. The place didn't seem busy but the food and service was especially slow. When the food arrived, it wasn't amazing. Sorry to say but I don't think we will be back.

We had a fun and informative afternoon!! John blows.... (J/K). He blows glass. Haha. We had an absolutely amazing time. The Circle 6 team is super cool. We spent another $20/each and made a second item in the same class! I  would highly recommend Circle 6. Awesome time.

I absolutely love Hacienda's. The staff and service are amazing. I especially love Angel - the best bartender ever! His sense of humor and level of service make each visit memorable and very enjoyable. Thanks Angel!   I order Irene's Enchiladas every time I visit. This dish is very delicious and is definitely my favorite. Try it! You won't be disappointed.   Can't wait to visit again.

Great food. Great service. However, we used a Living Social for two dinners with two glasses of wine... We upgraded our wine to a bottle... The manager did not grant the correct price discount. We had to argue the price difference. Shady! Just take advantage of your voucher and get out! Mary, server, was awesome.

What a great place for breakfast! The hostess immediately greeted me at the door. She was so cute and polite! I was sat at a comfy booth and promptly greeted by a server. I ordered the breakfast burrito which was absolutely delicious. Our food was quickly prepared and it seemed like a matter of seconds before it arrived at our table. Great service. Great food. Great atmosphere. I will definitely recommend this place to family and friends.

This establishment has absolutely wonderful food and very friendly staff. I ordered a chicken caesar wrap with a greek salad on the side. Both items were very very delicious and fresh in flavor and ingredients. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in search of delicious Greek food at a reasonable price. I love the new happy hour menu too. What a great spot to stop before the movies or a sporting event. I will be back!

Great food and great service!! Our food was served in only a few short minutes on a busy Saturday night at 7:00pm. By far the fastest restaurant service I have ever experienced.   I tried the BBQ with mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. Yum! Meal was delicious.   One of the managers stopped by our table and our waitress was wonderful. Very pleasant experience.   Live music most nights. We will definitely be back!
