Food was pretty good and atmosphere was nice. We were greeted upon arriving and chose to sit in the bar area. Luckily we caught the tail end of happy hour which was nice. Our bartender was a riot. It's been a long time since I've had a server that is so straightforward and friendly (with dry humor). There was another couple next to us that were some of her regulars that spoke very highly of the service as well. Made our date night a humorous one. I think her name was Angie or Angela. Definable ask for her section. We will return.

Food was very good and the staff was very pleasant. The food was priced a little higher than expected but overall very inexpensive for that area. Will go there again.

Do NOT do the yelp deal. It's a scam if you plan on having lunch with someone else that has also purchased the deal. It clearly states on the coupon that the limit is one per person, but they tell you later that it is only one per table. So we bought 5 and ended up being able to use 5. What a joke. They need to be honest in their terms. The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because they were quick to fill our glasses and the food was mediocre. Won't go back

First impression walking in was a Chipotle type restaurant but the food is WAY better. You can taste the freshness and the options and varieties available are immense. Highly recommended:)
