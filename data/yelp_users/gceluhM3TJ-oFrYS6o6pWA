I wouldn't normally check in or rate a Starbucks I go to because they're all pretty much the same. I believe this particular location recently went through a new facelift (remodel). It looks different from all the other Starbucks I've been to: High bar tops and community tables, nice outdoor setting, and open space. The setting reminds me of some of a few coffee places I've been to in NYC. Maybe that's why I like it so much. Oh and the baristas are welcoming too.

Update: went in and got some chicken tacos but disappointed with the quality of chicken. It was very fatty. Other than that, it's still a great place for some good eats.        17 years and this place is still standing strong!   Don't judge a book by its cover! Mucho taco will knock your socks off with their food and their customer service. I came in and ordered a few tacos and a carne asada burrito. The food was great. It contained a lot of meat, which I like.  Five stars definitely goes to their customer service. Even though it was busy with only one person running the front, they were attentive to each person!While I waited, they offered me free chips and salsa along with a cup of iced horchata. I don't care about the "free" part, but I care about the gesture; it was unexpected.  The salsa was spicy (yum) and the horchata was refreshing.    A must try place if you're ever nearby.

If I heard correctly, this is the first food bank ever! The staff were friendly and so were the other volunteers! You can go by yourself or as a group, it's fun either way. You leave the food bank feeling good, knowing that you were able to help others.   I would highly recommend coming out and volunteering. It doesn't cost you anything but your time.

I haven't had much luck choosing new restaurants lately. Let me save your pallet and your wallet!  Persian Garden Cafe is identified as Persian/Iranian Mediterranean - when I think of Mediterranean food I think of big bold flavors! Unfortunately, this place lacks just that!   I ordered the vegetarian sampler as an appetizer and the meat combo (chicken and beef kabobs) for dinner. My appetite isn't that big so I had to share it with the boyfriend of course.  Our appetizer took about 30 minutes before it was brought out. Not sure why it took so long because there's nothing special about it. The menu states that you get "naan" with the meal - don't mistaken that for any other naan you've ever had. This tasted like cardboard and looked like it too!   About 5 minutes later, our dinner followed (timing is impeccable here). Our meal consisted of basmati rice, chicken and beef kabobs. The basmati rice didn't carry that special aroma like it usually does. The beef and chicken lacked any kind of flavor or seasoning. I'm not sure how they did it, but they somehow took all the flavor out of the meal! I was going to ask for some hot sauce to spice things up, but our waiter never came back to check up on us.  Disappointed to say the least. Another first and last for me.

A friend of mine recommended this place and I finally got a chance to try it. It doesn't stand out like most restaurants so if you drive by it, you may miss it. It's a nice mom and pop store.   Oh my yum! The menudo and pozole are delicious. The portion is pretty big but if you really enjoy the soup, you can get the bottomless soup bowl.   I also got the Michelada here. They make it really well.   You can tell that everything is made fresh. We had to wait a few extra minutes for our chips and salsa because they were making the chips!

I don't like Tao Garden because it sounds like my name, I like Tao's because they serve great Chinese food. This is one of my go to spots when I'm craving Chinese. It doesn't hurt that the I leave Tao's feeling full like my wallet! They have great lunch specials and their dinner menu is decently priced as well.   I recommend trying some of their specials if you want something different; their specials never disappoint. I order their pea pod leaves every time, but that recommendation is for those who like veggies.

I initially started taking real estate classes because I wanted to learn more about the industry, not because I wanted to become a real estate agent. First few words out of the teacher were "we are not here to teach you about real estate, we are here to teach you how to pass the test". Upsetting at first, but then it made sense - You cannot learn about real estate unless you are in the field, but you can learn the terminology and laws through the classes.  The teachers here are great. Most of them are active brokers and they know what they are talking about. If you're not understanding a topic, they will slow it down and explain it until it's clear. There's a lot of information to take in but they give you a 10 minute breaks every 50 minutes or so. This will give you time to walk around, stretch, or eat. Make sure you bring in your lunch and/or snacks because that's all the time you get.   It's a small school with small rooms, which may be uncomfortable for some people. It's also a little musky, but I'm not sure why. They recently replaced the carpets with wood flooring.

Freshly hand made noodles right in front of your eyes! You can choose from 5 different types, which ranges from spaghetti like noodles to thick flat noodles. The meals are fairly priced. It's pretty cheap, but you get what you pay for!   This is my second time at China Magic Noodle House and it'll probably be my last. I wasn't impressed the first time and told myself I would never come back, but my boyfriend wanted to try it. We ordered number 11 with the cold marinated meat, the oxtail noodle soup with noodle D, and beef stir fry with a noodle they chose (never asked what kind of noodles we wanted).   The food was average, nothing to brag about. I would rather go to a Chinese restaurant and order take out.   The wait staff were not friendly and barely spoke English. They never returned to the table to ask if we wanted a refill on our drinks.

This place is not like any other shop. Hands down no comparison. Everything here is made fresh.   Their bagels are big and doughy (kinda chewy how I like it).   Eggs are real! (Not out of a carton or premade)   Bacon made to order.   I usually get the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich. Made perfect every time.   Plus it has a family feel to it. Not a chain store, but a mom and pop shop.

Juba has amazing food! If your taste buds are as adventurous as mine, this place is a must try!   I wanted a different dining experience, one that made me feel like I was somewhere else. I wanted to find a place where they served traditional ethnic food, while eating on the floor. What do you know, I found it! You are more than welcome to eat on dining tables, but if you want to go all out, take off your shoes and sit on the floor!  Whenever I go to a new restaurant, I like to ask the waiter what they would recommend and/or personally eat. I don't say no to many foods, so this girl ordered the lamb and goat on a bed of rice. I'm not an expert on Ethiopian food, but I know when something makes my taste buds wanting more. My dish was well prepared - bringing out flavors I'm not familiar with.   The food is inexpensive and the portions are large enough to share. What more can you ask for?

When it comes to food, I hardly ever turn away. This place may be the first to make it on my "never return" list.   I've been to Korea and tried their traditional cuisine, drove to California and stumbled upon great Korean restaurants, and even found a few spots in AZ that I can't complain about. This restaurant has the worst Korean food I have ever had and I can't say much about their service.   My boyfriend and I walked into the restaurant looking forward to the all you can eat Korean bbq ($20.99/person for 2 hours). As we entered, we saw a very empty room with a few employees standing around. We were then greeted by a young lady who walked us over to the Teppan  table. Not too bad yet, but just wait.   As we looked over the menu, we decided to start off trying two different types of meats, the bulgogi and the short ribs. Our waiter then said, "that's all you're getting?" Assuming that the portions were small, we ordered the spicy chicken as well!  A few minutes later our food came rolling out. By our surprise, there were no side dishes! I have never been to a Korean restaurant that didn't serve you small side dishes! The meat portion were huge (which is never a compliant); probably a pound of meat each. But when they charge you $15 dollars for not finishing the protein, that's when I get frustrated. I feel as though I was tricked into ordering more (Side note, you are not allowed to take it home either).  The pancake they served soaked up all the grease, which was not appetizing at all. They cooked the kimchi without asking our preference (I like mine cold). The beef that came out had good flavor, but I can't say the same about the chicken. The chicken was nasty. It didn't have the consistency that chicken should have so we never went back for seconds.   The other disappointment was that the the food was cooked on a Teppan table. When you go to any other Korean bbq restaurant that allows you to cook, you cook your food on the grill. Since this was on a Teppan table, I'm sure it wouldn't be safe for diners to cook by themselves so the waiter had to do. Our waiter was horrible! He started asking us what the kimchi was and once I told him, he said he would never eat that stuff. He didn't know anything about Korean bbq or how to cook it so the owner had to come in and cook for us (sub par service). I always have a soft side for new servers because I was once a server myself, but get some training on the food and how to cook it if that's your job.  I could go on and on but to sum it up, I was disappointed with the overall experience. We were in and out of the restaurant 25 minutes flat. I will never go back to this establishment. Good luck if you do!

I love the coffee here. I haven't had Intelligentsia coffee until I stopped by WhereUBean - you can definitely taste the quality of the coffee compared to most places.   This is a small cozy coffee shop. The baristas are friendly and make an effort to get to know you. My favorite barista is Adam. He's been a great addition to the coffee shop.   They also serve fresh baked goods. Definitely a must try if you like sweets. If you come in at the right time, you can smell them baking! Mmm   I usually get a hot honey latte. Yum!

A few of my boyfriends friends swears by this place. They say it's the best Cajun food they've ever had! Unfortunately my experience was a little different.   Walking into the restaurant, I figured they would have change the decor from the previous restaurant/owner. I was wrong. Everything looked the same!  The meal itself was not hitting the spot (I'm usually easy to please when it comes to food). We started with their crab cakes - green onions were overwhelming, salty, over seasoned, and too fried. I think crabs have a great natural taste that doesn't need to be masked by all the seasonings. We then decided to share the half fried oyster po boy and half seafood gumbo. The seafood gumbo wasn't anything special; a little too salty for my liking. The fried oyster in the po boy must have been old because it had a stench after biting into it and the texture was off. To be honest, we weren't feeling too good afterwards.   Sad to say, but this place is one and done on our list.

Heard about Greenmix from a few friends; many of them giving this place a good review so I figured I'd try it out. It's a pretty cool concept for those who are looking for a healthier option when eating out. You can create your own salad or order the ones they've already put together. There are panini's, wraps and rice bowls as well.  I created my own salad which included, spinach, baby bell peppers, jicama, almonds, mangos topped with Korean bbq beef and a side of dressing.   For a salad like that, I wouldn't mind waiting 10 minutes for because you have to cook the meat. Very disappointed with what I got and how long I waited. It took about 25 minutes for my salad to come out to the table. Mind you, there was no one in there beside my boyfriend and I. The Korean bbq didn't taste like any Korean bbq I've ever had. Seemed like it lacked certain flavors that they are known for.   I like the concept but probably won't be back.

I've been to the one located downtown and loved it! The Tempe location did not let me down. You still have the same feel - all the beers, live music, and friendly staff.   I came here on a Thursday evening with one of my girlfriends. We tried their brown bag surprise! You get a random beer in a brown bag... Neither you nor the bartender knows what kind of beer it is until its in front of you.   Something I've never seen at other bars/restaurants are waiters walking around with samples of their food. I guess this is something they do at random a few times a week. We got to try their bruschetta and meatballs.  Fun time. Live music. Oh and Tempe improv is next door!
