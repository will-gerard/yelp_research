Jenny loves smiles!  And it shows!  First of all, the coffee was hot, and I mean hot!  But, let's be honest, it is supposed to be!  The bagel was very good, perfectly toasted, and when I asked if I could order an extra side of veggie schmear, she said "absolutely"! (free of charge!) The customer service was excellent, the restaurant was clean, and Jenny-you are very good at your job,  it shows through all of your employees.  Keep up the great work!

They are only getting one star because yelp requires it.   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Was caught behind an accident that was keeping me from picking up my call in order.  Nothing to do about that out here, Hunt Highway is one lane each way.. One would think that this would be an acceptable excuse to not pick up my call in order, and I thought it best to call and let them know I would not be able to make it in. Oh, no!  The man on the other end screamed at me!!  Called me nasty names and called me (expletive) stupid!  Told me he would call the sheriff as he had my phone number.  I tried to explain the situation once again, however, he could not even hear me as he was screaming at me at the top of his voice!  I finally had to hang up on him.  Needless to say, this was my first and last time trying this Chen's Chinese Restaurant. Will drive the extra distance to go to the Chen's down the road near the Safeway in Florence.

Bean dip, yummy!  Spinach enchiladas- the only thing I ever order, and I always make everyone else try them- they are that good! The only thing that I suggest is that they get hitching posts, and perhaps a trough....when we ride horses in to the restaurant, we tie up to the light posts.

I am VERY pleased with the service from Dr. Gus and his staff from start to finish in regards to my 10 year old Rat Terrier Louie. Dr. Gus listened to all of my concerns, was attentive to Louie's needs, and still practices old fashioned customer service. He and his staff member called me on two different occasions to check on Lou after surgery, and the front desk staff were also very efficient when I returned  for a follow-up visit and collar return.  The prices are quite reasonable, they don't put your animal under anesthesia unless necessary, (which was an issue with another vet closer to home) and in my opinion well worth the drive from San Tan Valley!  Thank you thank you thank you!!!

This site makes you give a star- but I would like everyone to know that I am giving ZERO stars.. DO NOT book a reservation at all with Gallo Blanco- they can not handle it....I booked a birthday party for 24 (with two months notice)... and they dropped the ball, BIG TIME!!! ~Service...slow to non existent and our server was RUDE!  ~Food... sparse and WAY overpriced for a sit down meal... ~Bar...is it a hassle to order a drink?  It is at Gallo Blanco...we bought bottles of wine   1. Our food was over an hour and a half late (reservations at 7:30pm and food was still coming out at 9:45pm!!!....it's tacos folks.....and there was not enough food for everyone!!! 2. We had NO water, (we were seated outside!!!!!) 3. Impossible to get drinks or water at bar...  * When reporting problems to the owner, Denise, she sent me an email offering no apologies or acknowledgement that guests were upset...  Rather, she sent me a copy of the order to the kitchen, which just proved that the kitchen and staff were wrong in regards to amount of food to be served!!!!   The most disgusting part of the whole ordeal was her closing to her email, which said: "At this point, and will all due respect, we are done."    GALLO BLANCO HAS ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  P.S. The Clarendon is not affiliated with Gallo Blanco.....is just houses the restaurant unfortunately.

The food here is delicious, the restaurant and bathrooms are always very clean,  and the staff always makes sure we feel welcome and that we don't want for anything.  Have not had a bad menu item yet, and the menu has many different offerings.  The lunch pricing is the best bang for the buck!

At first, I was a bit hesitant to order sushi in San Tan Valley....after living in San Francisco...however,  the Sashimi- the best I have had in the valley! HANDS DOWN THE BEST PORTIONS!   For under $19.00, you get large portions and fresh-never frozen fish! Sushi- great options and again-fresh and delish!   Each time I have been, (more than 4 times) I have ordered a different entree, and have been pleasantly suprised each and every time... Miso soup-smokey, plenty of tofu, and loads of flavor!!!   I am confused about the negative mentions of this restaurant.  As a chef, a foodie, and as a traveler, I am picky.  I do not understand the mention that Kyoto Bowl and others may offer better food.  Perhaps, these non foodies do not understand the culture of good Asian food.   My hats off to Irene=thank you for offering great Asian cusine in the middle of 'nowhere'. I recommend this place to all of my friends from the city.......

Once again,  Wow!  The sashimi plate was out of this world- and the Mackerel was delightful!  Yummers.   Each time my boyfriend and I eat here, we try something different, and each time- it is amazing.   The fish is fresh and brought in every other day, the portions are large and Irene is great! I suggest sitting up at the sushi bar...

We don't even ask for menus any longer.  We just sit at the sushi bar and have Irene choose our meal, appetizer to dessert.... Perfect every time!!!  We go once a week!
