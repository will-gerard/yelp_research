This was a delicious simple Mexican short order shop.  I had the az burrito and was surprised at the number of ingredients it had.  My son had the quesadilla.  Horchata had a unique flavor to it the was interesting.  Meal came to $16.  Plus Guy ate here!

A nice break from the chains.  I hade a raspberry salad with chicken that was great and my mom had the burger which she really enjoyed.  One of my favorites in ahwatukee.

I've to this cafe a couple times. Their food and drinks are yummy.  I had sesame burger and my son had the teriyaki chicken.  It was a little too different for him but it didn't stop me from finishing it for him.  I would have liked a few more choices of dishes with meat but I suppose that would defeat the whole vegan cafe idea.

I bought 2 crab to treat my wife on her birthday at the store #1201 4005 E. Chandler boulevard. In Phoenix.  When I got them home and steamed them powerful ammonia smell developed which is the sign of decomposing crab.  We finished the evening with leftovers and we threw the crab out.    When I went into to the store the next day I told them what happened and gave my receipt.   The older lady managing the service desk told me she couldn't give me a refund and asked me why I hadn't brought in the smelly crab.  I really expected better customer service from Safeway. Disappointing experience.

Went into store and spoke to George the store manager after being prompted by one of the Safeway employees.  George listened to my experience and apologized.  Also said he had spoken to the employee working that night.  Followed up by offering me a refund and a small outback gift card to make up for birthday dinner.  Most importantly I felt listened to.  Can't change my rating to 5 star because I wish it hadn't happened at all, but I felt like they did a good job of trying to make the best of the situation.

I inquired about services with three different process servers and Britney contacted me within a few hours on a Sunday night.  I was able to send her my documents Monday morning and she had served the papers before the other two companies even responded.  Fast, easy and great communication at a reasonable fee.  Thanks Britney!
