I realize I'm one of the many 5 star reviews, but my experience was with their takeout service. Couldn't have been more friendly. The food was as good as ever and it was ready right on time. Love oreganos and the people that work there.

I just had a shrimp taco and carne asada enchilada that blew my mind. I'm currently in a post delicious meal nirvana/coma. So good.

Really enjoy Chen Wok and appreciate how accommodating they are to vegetarians. My gf is vegetarian, so I always request that they don't use chicken broth with the assorted veggies and veggie lo mein. Lo Mein is always delicious. A previous commenter mentioned the smell outside, which is usually pretty bad, so just stay home put that out of your mind and order delivery!

Realize I'm just piling on here with all the positive reviews, but this place is gem. Great patio when the weather permits and delicious food. They typically have a decent groupon offer running also, just don't forget to tip your waiter on the original total!

Not sure how I've waited so long to write a review, but this place is great. Great ambiance, great food and always great beer on tap. This is basically my go to spot and it never fails to deliver.

Spent the evening here for the ASU/UofA game. Couldn't have been happier. Great atmosphere, service and food. I spend a lot of time at the Scottsdale location, and while there is a different vibe, I think it's a perfect fit for the Mill Ave college crowd.

Most people go in to the car buying experience expecting things to go terribly. I went in with a positive attitude, but Camelback Kia did everything in their power to make sure that I did in fact have that terrible experience.   I was at the dealership for about 4 hours even though I knew the two specific vehicles that I wanted to see. I wasn't shown either vehicle, and every time I asked to see those cars, they acted completely oblivious and just started talking about something else. It was the strangest thing. That night I went online and found a Kia Soul at a competing Kia dealership in south Scottsdale. I went there the following day and bought the car because they actually showed it to me. I could have been the easiest sale ever for these guys.   Since this ordeal, Camelback Kia has probably called me 20 times. Each time they call, I ask them to take me off of their list and they fall all over themselves  apologizing for "losing my business" and they promise that they will remove me from their call list immediately. Well, here we are almost a month later and they are still calling and clueless in regards to my situation. I'm typically a pleasant individual, but these people have me heated.   So, Camelback Kia, here is my message to you: every phone call I get from you moving forward, I will copy/paste this review and add it to an additional review site. Yelp first, DealerRater next, then Cars.com and Google. And please, don't bother responding to this review.

Not sure what the hype is all about. We've been here twice and the food was underwhelming, service was poor, and they managed to mess up our order both times and did nothing to fix it.

Updating a previous review. I must have caught them on off nights the first couple times because our third visit was a great success. Food was good (I had the smoke house) and the customer service had improved big time. Will most likely be back.
