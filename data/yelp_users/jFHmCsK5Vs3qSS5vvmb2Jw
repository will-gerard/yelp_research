Really crazy selection of invitations. I cant believe how many books they had!! Wow, definitely more than any other venue in Phoenix.   That said, unless you are thinking of invitations over $8/person (not possible for me because I have an insane guest list), then it is not the place for you. I guess they have a lot of invitation books for less, but that selection is not nearly as exciting or unique as the high end stuff.  The women who I met there were not friendly but not rude either - definitely tend to leave you alone to sort through things.  I didnt end up ordering anything from here because I found beautiful invitations that looked very expensive for a lot less through Hallmark.  But this is a place I would definitely recommend to START (and possibly finish, if you're lucky) invitation shopping. You learn a LOT about the different possibilities and styles.

Great lunch place with good food and good service, but not so sure about five stars... I dont give those out that easily.  I ordered the bruschetta plate: - Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone - delicious! - Brie & Apples with Fig Spread - delicious though a little sweet - Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato - delicious but gets a little soggy - Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil - good but the tomato was not very ripe  My sister had the chicken salad, with pecans, apples, gorgonzola and raspberry vinaigrette - she said it was alright. I tried some of her Prosciutto with Brie panini, that comes with fig jam and arugula - that was really really good. Heavy on the prosciutto, light on the fig jam - an excellent balance :)  They also have happy hour drinks 7 days a week -- all wines $5/glass, draft beers $5/pitcher -- worth noting!  Overall I liked the place and the prices were great, but I think my expectations of a soulful renovated historic post office were maybe too high.

Incredibly disappointing! I think that this was the worst decision I made for our wedding. She didn't provide enough flowers and yet her quote increased at the wedding, and though the ballroom looked nice, the rest of the ceremony and event looked cheap and/or empty and/or full of glitches (thing falling apart, things left fallen by the alter..etc). She's nice but for the price we paid, we were so disappointed. I've just spent a lot of time in the floral industry lately and realize now how much beauty and care could have gone into this event but didnt. For what we paid, I've seen stunning weddings with lush florals and it saddens me when I think about what we got. Honestly, three years later, I still feel disappointed in the wedding flowers she provided. I would not recommend her.

I love this airport. I come here all the time, and it's so spacious and clean and new-feeling.

I love this place! It's pretty far away from us (we live in Scottsdale) but well worth the drive.  We usually do the Mormon Trail and the Hidden Valley Fat Man's Pass which is a pretty nice leisurely walk with incredible views, but last weekend we did the Holbert Trail (mostly because we got lost and ended up on a different side of the park than we planned - now we know to take 24th St all the way down.)  The Holbert trail was really nice too. It's also pretty leisurely and probably the same level of difficulty as the Mormon trail (easy to moderate - easy for most, moderate if you are deconditioned, afraid of heights, or have joint problems). It's really nice to do on a cool morning.

Wow, this place has one of the worst services I've experienced, in terms of shopping for a bridal gown.   When I called them, they basically told me that it was getting late and that I wouldn't really be able to try on dresses, but I said I just really wanted to take a look at their collection, and they sort of grudgingly agreed.  Then, when I got there, (still an hour and a half before the store closes), there were NO customers in the store, so I'm not sure why I was warned that they were so busy.  Anyway, their collection is ok. Not as nice as Destiny's Bride or Mariee, but they have a lot of dresses to look through. I didnt find many newer styles, but I tried on three dresses, one of which was really pretty.  I worked with this woman named Sue, who barely talked to me. She disappeared every time I tried on a dress, and sometimes forgot to help pin it on. One time, I came out holding this huge dress up, went in front of my family, and she just stared for a while, and then was like, "Oh, I guess I should pin that".   Afterwards, I asked for the details of the gown I liked, and she gave me a card with just her name. No gown information. So when I looked at her, confused, and asked about the gown, she literally said "oh, its style .... "... and then I asked, "and the price?" and she just responded "Oh, ...."  I had to ask my family for a pen to write that down. How can you shop from a place like that?  It was ridiculous! Maybe Sue was having a bad day or just wanted to go home, but seriously, I was so offended and shocked by her attitude. I mean, the gowns are alright (and definitely less expensive than other places... ) but not worth the crappy service!  I hate to pull this card out, but I'm south asian, and I really think that all the people I interacted with would have been a hell of a lot nicer if I wasnt.

Wonderful art museum! I had honestly resisted for several years (My parents live in Paradise Valley, and I visit a few times a year) because I didn't know what to expect. This December, I finally went on a thursday, when they have free admissions, and it was incredible!   The James Turrell piece was very meditative, particularly the subtle color and light shifts that happen over minutes and the dramatic shifts that happen over hours. I found myself in that space with at least 20 people in inspired silence for at least half an hour during one of my visits, and in many ways, it felt more raw and magical than the exhibit at the Guggenheim.   There was also an exhibit dedicated to Julianne Swartz entitled "How Deep Is Your", that was amazing - delicate, vulnerable, strong, weak, frail, love-filled, love-lorn, nostalgic... a beautiful experience of human emotion.   And lastly, an exhibit of contemporary Japanese art exploring water, elements, and scale, that left you with a new sense of wonder and possibility.   I am an artist myself, and I feel like contemporary art museums are hit-or-miss situations. This one was one of the best I've been to, so well curated and thoughtfully presented, with emphasis on quality rather than quantity, and I will definitely be going back every time I am in town.

Wow this place is AMAZING!  I AM NOT A VEGETARIAN or vegan, by any stretch of the imagination, and was dragged here by some vegetarian friends who swore this place was amazing, and I left completely converted, at least to Green.  What I love about this place is that it's VEGETARIAN COMFORT FOOD. The flavor profiles are so delicious, the replacement for meats tastes so good (no weird textures or weird after tastes), and you don't feel like you have to be super healthy (although you can choose healthier options if you want).   The spicy buffalo wings, the chili fries, the big wac burger, and the samosas were DELICIOUS. The atmosphere is very casual and minimal, and the prices are great. I am so impressed!

The Cholla Trail is amazing!!! Im glad I got new sneakers for christmas, because I needed that traction. Really fun hike -  Im scared of heights which makes things a little complicated, but I LOVE hiking and the views from this mountain are incredible.  First time I made it almost to the helipad, second time almost to the summit (stopped after the climbing got a little too vertical and steep but plan to push on next time). Took us a little over an hour to get near the top. I am DEFINITELY coming back. Most fun hike I've done in a while!

Great hike, absolutely beautiful views, and quite a work out. The trail is never too narrow or unsafe, but does require careful maneuvering at parts, and steep rocks. The challenge made it more fun, and it was inspiring to see some of the more experienced hikers run up and down. The views from the summit were beautiful, and the exercise refreshing.  I'd recommend bringing water, sunglasses/hat, and coming earlier in the morning to avoid too much sun.

Mmmm best boba in Arizona, hands down, and at a great price.  Reminds me of the Boston Tea Stop in Harvard Square, Cambridge, MA.

Oh my gosh, this is the best sushi I have had in a while!   First of all, a really nice ambiance that is modern and sleek but with some dimmer lighting to make it feel a little more warm and inviting. There is room on the patio too, by the fire pits, but it was a little too hot last night - maybe in the fall!  Our waitstaff were really sweet and courteous, and the place has an open kitchen so you can see (and smell ! ) all the amazingness that is being prepared.  Everything we ordered was delicious! The lamb dish with korean spices was perfectly cooked (we asked for it to be medium, instead of medium rare, which I think was a good move), and the sides were amazing - especially the sweet potato and the brussel sprouts.   And the sushi - they make even the classics absolutely mouthwatering, from salmon-avocado to crispy prawns to the california roll. The quality of the fish was excellent, and I think next time I'll probably order some sashimi too.   We weren't even that hungry, but we finished everything it was so good!  Definitely recommend this place! I'm going to have to come back for the happy hour!

These cupcakes are INCREDIBLE! We got them as a gift a few weeks ago, finished all 12 by the next day, and have been craving them since, so we went to get more yesterday.  BEST ONES TO GET: tie between red velvet and white chocolate raspberry also recommend marble several people liked the chocolate ones, but I'm not a chocolate flavor person...  What makes these cakes so amazing? They are the perfect consistency, not too sweet, not too rich, the icing is delicious, and you don't feel sick at all, or get a sugar low after the sugar high, like most cakes...   If they did big wedding cakes and I had known about them 5 years ago, I would have definitely ordered that from here too!

This place really surprised me. So peaceful and relaxing inside, the private rooms were excellent, the beds even have a heater if you want that option, and my masseuse was great. Seriously, Im surprised it can be this good for so little cost. Will definitely be coming back.  The two downsides to my experience were 1) i waited half an hour for my 6oclock appointment, and 2) I was quoted $25 per person over the phone since we had a large party, but when we went to pay, they charged $30 per person. Just a little irksome.

Oh my gosh, this place was terrible.  I went to look at bridal gowns, and had an appointment at 3, and had to wait till 4 to be seen! Then, the girl was so busy helping the OTHER customer, who just walked in the door, that I would be waiting in the fitting room for ages, for her to pin me in the dress. She wasnt helpful, she didnt make me feel comfortable, she didnt take any time to talk with my family, and she was just sort of tacky, in the dresses she would pick out.  Their dress selection is not bad. They have a lot of beaded dresses. I didnt find anything that I really liked. Two of the dresses were pretty, the rest were just sort of average. Most were between $800 - $2000  Not really worth going to. Go to Destiny's Bride or Mariee. They have much better gowns and much more experienced, sophisticated staff.

Excellent experience. I got a great manicure and pedicure there last week. The staff is really friendly, the treatment is much more involved than most (massages were excellent and lasted at least 5 minutes more than at other places) and the whole thing was $30. The quality was great, my nails still look amazing.

This is a really beautiful 4 mile hike to Tom's Thumb and back. It's mild-moderate in terms of difficulty, but I didn't rock climb/scramble up the last bit, so keep that in mind.  It just feels like a peaceful walk in the desert, far away from the city, and the views are incredible the entire time.  I'm definitely going back for a longer trail.

What a cool place! It's an upscale pub and refreshingly versatile. If you wanted to come with a few friends and have bar food, it's great. If you want to come with a big group, it's a fun, loud atmosphere. But somehow there is something very romantic about it - I'm not sure if its the dim candle-lit mood or the way that you just feel in your own world, but you can have a very intimate dinner right in the middle of it all and not even notice.  The food is delicious!! I had the BEST GRILLED CHEESE ever. High quality cheese and bread, and white truffle scented mashed potatoes! Mmmmmmmm. The crabcakes are delicious and the short ribs were excellent! The catfish was also delicious but it's pretty spicy, so be aware. It's a little on the pricier side, but you're in the middle of downtown Scottsdale with great ambiance and very good food. Definitely makes for a special night.   4.5 stars so I'll round up!

This is one of my favorite places for lunch in Phoenix/Scottsdale so far! Really delicious food, beautiful ambiance, excellent service - and at a very reasonable price.  We came here yesterday and were pleasantly surprised to see that happy hour is from 11-6:30. The weather was incredible so we sat outside in their beautiful courtyard. The decor is modern contemporary, and they play soft pop/R&B from the 90s and 2000s, which is kind of mellow in an unpretentious way. We had a really sweet waitress who made sure that our experience was very smooth.  Onto the best part - the food --- When the bread is incredible, it's just such a good sign! The balsamic vinagrette with the oil is really excellent quality. I almost asked them where they get it, because we've been having trouble finding good balsamic out here. After the bread, we had Mini Ciabatta Sliders, which come with ricotta, basil, asiago, EVOO, and fig jam that is to die for! Then I ordered the Grilled Cheese and Short Rib sandwich, which came pressed with arugula, caramelized onions, manchego & cheddar. Again, AMAZING. My husband ordered the Bistro Tender & Panzanella Salad, which is served with grilled beef tenderloin, organic tomatoes, red onions, olives, romaine, croutons, and drizzled with balsamic reduction. He took a bite and was like "Wow, this is REALLY good!"  I cant stress enough how good the food is! The fresh ingredients, delicious flavor profiles, unique combinations... it really feels like the person who is making your food cares deeply for it, and it makes a big difference!  I will definitely be back!

A nice, friendly, quiet little coffee shop. A good place to read a book or work, but not so much socialize.   I prefer the coffee and atmosphere at Diesel.

This place is amazing! It's like a more upscale Mexican place that gives you better quality food in more of a Scottsdale, contemporary casual setting, at a very good price.  I came here for lunch a few weeks ago. There's a really nice shaded outdoor seating area, an awesome lunch menu with delicious drinks (they have a full bar), and approachable, friendly service.   I had the Linguica (portuguese sausage) with house rice, and also tried the braised short ribs with house rice. Both dishes were amazing! I also had the Mexican Martini, which is basically just a delicious margarita.

The biggest Indian market/supermarket I've been to in a long time. Great fresh produce, almost a whole aisle dedicated to spices, at least 10 different kinds of rice in huge 20 lb bags...   I just wish they carried Cadburys.

Nook is like a fancier version of a sports bar. For the kind and quality of the food, and the overall much more casual experience than we expected, the price point seems a little high.The food is good (particularly the short ribs, but the salmon was dry, the swordfish lacked flavor, and sometimes the presentation was quite lacking), the service is excellent, and overall I think its a 3.5 star experience (I'll round up to 4 for Yelps sake).   It feels cosy and casual, even though it is pretty dimly lit, largely because of the TVs right next to the booth seating area. That's probably why it feels more like a sports bar than an intimate restaurant. Most of the other diners seem to be in their 30s-50s and the atmosphere was pretty relaxed. Let's just say there are a lot of tattoos and piercings in the room, which is totally fine with me but did not sit well with some of older, more traditional professionals I came here with. It feels more like a cool place to come with friends, than a place to have a fancy dinner with colleagues or family.

This is a really nice pizza place in Scottsdale that is also attached to Forno Fabbri (a market and bar area). The ambiance is relaxed, casual, contemporary. There's a shaded outdoor patio (a little too cold at the moment), as well as indoor seating. The service is friendly, and the food is delicious.  We shared the POMO pizza (comes with sausage, mushroom, bellpeppers, and onions), the lasagna, and the Capri panini (with Italian sausage, sauteed mushrooms, roasted red bell peppers, sauteed onions, & evoo). The pizza and panini were very good, with quality bread/crust and very fresh-tasting ingredients. I didn't really like the lasagna that much - a little too rich and creamy, and the pasta felt soft and a little overcooked.  Definitely a solid experience though.

This is such a cute place to get a few drinks and some bites and enjoy a warm evening in downtown Scottsdale. The crowd is mostly younger 20somethings and 30somethings, which is refreshing because it seems to be generally an older crowd that hangs out at nicer places in the downtown area. We really loved sitting outside and enjoying our cocktails. I would definitely go back and try more food :)

First place I went to try on dresses, and it was amazing!  I worked with Sara, who was so thoughtful and considerate and really helped me with each gown before coming out to show my family.  She made me feel really comfortable, and always gave her genuine opinion when I asked for it.   They have gorgeous dresses there, at great prices. (from what I experienced, 1500s - 3500s, mostly). A huge variety, a lot of different styles, and seriously, some of the best dresses I saw in Phoenix. I am still deciding - and a dress from here is in the final 3 - that's the trouble with dress shopping, usually so many dresses look great, and you can really get confused by which ones you like the most - and the nicer stores carry beautiful, unique collections, so you never know where you will find the dress.  I seriously had such a great experience at Destiny's Bride, though, that I highly recommend, if you are getting married in Phoenix, you absolutely HAVE to stop here. It's definitely one of the top two places for gowns, and their service is amazing - It's the whole package.

Ended up getting a dress from here after all! It's funny that it was the first store I went to ... I should have just stopped there - I would have saved a lot of time!   Waiting for my dress, now. And still recommend this as one of the best bridal stores in Phoenix, definitely the best in terms of overall experience.  Just request to work with Sara. I cant really vouch for the same experience otherwise.
