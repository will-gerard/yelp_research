I don't know why I keep gravitating back to this HRC location because it's always been just blah at best. Last night's dinner was no different.  Went with a party of 7 and we were smart to use their Please Excuse service found on the website so that we could cut to the front of the line before the Suns game.   The place was busy and our server appeared capable, but looks can be deceiving. As it turns out, service was what it usually is, slow. We had a mixture of sodas, water, beer, and mixed drinks at our table and unless we ASKED for a refill, it wasn't coming. We would have spent more on alcohol if the server seemed remotely interested in serving us.  Our appetizers took FOREVER to come out. Meanwhile glasses sat empty on the table. The appetizers finally came--we ordered the sampler tray and a chicken quesadilla. It was tasty. Nothing special. The potato skins were particularly notable though as they were perfectly done and NOT greasy. Refills FINALLY came after we had to ask twice for them.   Dinner comes out before the appetizer dishes were cleared and we were starting to have an excessive amount of glasses and bottles on the table that the server didn't feel necessary to remove from the table. *sigh*  Most of us had burgers and they were all just basic burgers. I had the california burger and it was a big sloppy mess. Someone had the bright idea of putting the guac on the burger before the cheese. The cheese is the glue and the guac goes on the bun. As soon as I attempted to pick it up to eat, everything slid all over and I ended up having to eat it with a fork and knife. The fries were bland. And we waited again and again for refills.  It's conveniently located right across the street from the Suns arena and I think this is really the last time I"m going to subject myself to this place. I've been to MANY HRC's across the globe and this one is the worst one.   Can't SOMEONE put a decent place in downtown Phoenix? PLEASE!

I have been to Alice Cooperstown MANY times over the years but it was the most recent experience that made me think back to all those times and wonder why it is I keep coming back?   The food is bland. I don't know how much simplier I can be. The Big Unit--Bland. The Ryne Sandburger--Bland. French Fries---DOUBLE bland. Onion Rings---Bland. The BBQ dipping dauce for the onion rings--BLAND. There is absolutely NO FLAVOR to this food! Thank God for ketchup and mustard cuz otherwise it would have been your basic hosptial food. And every other time I've gone here, it's been bland bland bland food. Nothing pops at this restaurant when it comes to the food. And the drinks...blah at best. I once ordered a Waborita and had to send it back three because it was so watered down. You'd have to spend a lot of money to get a buzz on at this place because the drinks are very watered down. The beers are crisp and fresh, but the drinks..not so much.   Now if you are looking for ATMOSPHERE, Cooperstown is your place.  The staff all have the Alice Cooper-esque eye-liner which is cool. There is Alice memoribilia covering every inch of every wall in the place. And of course all good theme restaurants have a gift shop.  They have great live bands that come out to play and when there is no band, they have great piped in music too.    Cooperstown is a novel place to take out-of-town guests before a game, but if it's just you and your family, you won't feel empty if you skip it.  It's just too much money to spend on very bland, uneventful food.

This is the original Macayo's and man has it seen better days. The decor is old. The carpeting is tired. The plates are chipped and scratched up. The service is crap and the food is NOT what it is at other Macayo's around town. It took our server 10 minutes to come and get our drink order. One member of our party ordered a Coke and it was totally flat. It took her another 10 minutes to replace it.  I had a chicken taco and the chicken tasted canned. The server spilled salsa all over the table and took forever to come back to clean it up. One member of our party ordered a bean and cheese burrito enchilada style and got a beef and green chili burrito with verde sauce...and then our server seemed befuddled when we asked for her to replace it with what we actually ordered.  Honestly, I have eaten in better dive-Mexican places than this Macayos. Definitely skip this spot.

LOVE Schreiner's! Have been several times to stock up on sausage and fresh meats. We've even done the brown bag lunch.  Jalape√±o sausages are AMAZING. The Maple Blueberry sausage is unbelievable. The staff is very knowledgeable and helpful. We can't wait to go back!

Fun, friendly, prompt service and tasty food? What's not to like? Portions here are definitely Texas-size so you are not going to go away hungry. They were very accommodating to our large party and our server was excellent.   Parking here is HORRIBLE though. The restaurant is on the corner of 16th St. and Bethany Home in a rundown strip mall. The spots themselves are short and it's difficult to get into and out of the lot. Not sure if there is a special trick to parking here but please keep in mind when you come that parking is sucky.   Now, bear in mind when you come here, there are not many "healthy options" on the menu. And they are not ashamed of this at all. They embrace the Texas size deep fried, heavily battered foods they offer unabashedly. As someone who is careful about what I eat, I did manage to get a salad and felt good about it. All the dishes came out at the proper temperatures and were freshly made and nicely plated.   Looking forward to going back in the near future!

Fab-u-lous!   The architecture is amazing and the hotel and grounds are decorated perfectly for the holidays. The food is elegant, sophisticated, and perfectly done. The brunch buffet is beautiful and flavorful with a nice variety of cold items.  The brunch is pricey starting at at least $28 depending on which entree you select. The buffet is included in the price of your selected entree. The buffet on it's own is $30. Expensive, but well worth the price.   It was a lovely treat for the holidays!

One word--3 syllables--FAB-U-LOUS  All the best parts of Scottsdale without the annoying snobs!  Party of 4 went yesterday and we had a varied sampling from the menu. Had the olives and pub board as appetizers along with a very nice Spanish red wine that was suggested by the server. The Pub Board was fantastic with Portuguese chorizo, cheese, and a very yummy homemade pretzel. The olives were a really great sampling of many different types and they all complimented our wine well too.   Hubby had the Autostrada with the potato cheese soup, I had the 9 Iron with soup, friends split the Proscuitto with Brie with chips. All were positively perfect!  For dessert, we ordered a bottle of a white Spanish wine Fuente Milano and it had a nice grapefruity after taste that was very cleansing on the palate before we had the Chocolate Bouchon, the Creme Brulee, and the salted carmel sundae. OMG...all were so yummy and the wine went perfectly!  The nicest part about Postino is that it isn't on a main Scottsdale Rd. drag....it's actually nestled on a side street off of 39th St. and Campbell. You'd never know it was there if you weren't looking for it but apparently plenty of people know about it because it was hopping at noon yesterday.  If you haven't tried it....go. You won't regret it. It was hip, fun, and the food was realistically priced and absolutely DELICIOUS!

My little man and I had a great time! Such a variety of rooms for the kids to use their imaginations in that it's mind-blowing.  The store is super clean, nicely laid out, and when the cafe is done, will be absolutely complete. Definitely buying a membership our next visit back. Just wish that it wasn't 45 minutes away from my house!   I do wish they had a cell phone policy though. There was a woman there who spent the entire time, and we were there for 2 hours, on her phone talking loudly in some Eastern European language. She hardly watched her children who were all over the place. There's a difference between letting kids explore and letting them run like wild animals.  She was even on the phone while in the bathroom trying to change diapers. It was unreal. There were other mothers who were there who were on and off the phones the entire time and not paying attention to their children. I think a cell phone policy would definitely get parents to engage with their kids and be present for even just a short while.   All in all, Imagination Avenue was a GREAT visit. We can't wait to go back!

We had a blast at AMF Desert Hills a few weeks ago! The service was the most friendly I've ever experienced at a bowling alley. They actually came to our lane several times to check on us and make sure we were taken care of. Brought our food to us from the snack bar and everything! Never had this kind of treatment at a bowling alley before! Looking forward to going back for another family night!

I had avoided going to Castles N'Coasters for many years based on the reputation it has had of being a haven for misfits, gang members, and otherwise annoying guests. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this reputation is not at all what I experienced at CnC. While it was not without it's challenges, it was overall a very nice experience.   Pros: Cool rollercoasters Fun golf experience Friendly and Courteous staff  Cons: Not enough staff to handle the crowds Not enough staff to handle a private party AND maintain the general public's needs.   I can see where the tightly squeezed in rides might make it difficult to navigate around the narrow park if it were a crowded day. Further, it was strange and a bit unsettling that the rides were manned by only 1 staff person. For safety sake, there should be two sets of eyes checking for properly buckled guests. Plus it would sure make the lines run faster. Finally, if you are going to offer an unlimited pass-it should include the zip line.   It is a pricey day though to come here so if you are able to find a coupon--I recommend it highly. But, all in all, a nice day and I'm looking forward to going back with my son and nieces.

Worst.seats.ever.   We are avid movie-goers and this theater has, by far, the most uncomfortable movie seats anywhere in the valley. It totally ruins the movie-going experience when you can't get comfortable in the seats. We will absolutely NOT be back to this theater again.

Enjoyed a fun visit with a big group of friends recently. Service was EXCELLENT and food was perfect size for all of us to share.  The food was delicious....not necessarily authentic, but it was served hot, fresh, and tasted great. I would definitely go back to this location again in the future.

Organ Stop Pizza is a childhood favorite of mine. We visited this location as well as the downtown Phoenix location before it for years. Now that I live in the far west valley, it's been, easily 10 years since I last visited OSP.  We happened to be in the neighborhood for a Convention so we brought a large group of friends to experience OSP themselves.  First things first, this place is visited by a lot of retirees. And by a lot I'd say that we were the youngest group there by at least 50 years...and the glares to the kids in our group did not go unnoticed. But our kids are all very well behaved despite the daggered looks from those who forget what it's like to have children.   Speaking of children, OSP is not very kid-friendly when it comes to certain areas that we apparently take for granted. There are no cups with lids on them at all. We were informed that they need to have a special 'license' for that from Pepsi. This is news to me as I've worked with Pepsi for years and know of no special license. The excuse was that they were afraid that people would take the kid cups, put alcoholic beverages in them and walk out of the restaurant. um...WHAT? Additionally, if you have a child who requires his pizza cut up into smaller pieces, good luck trying to find a knife there. There was 1 and I mean o-n-e (1) butter knife in the whole restaurant that we practically had to sign over our first born child in order to use. I'm pretty sure that the retirees aren't looking to shank each other in the parking lot so to have to play verbal judo with the staff to use a standard utensil was really ridiculous.  The restaurant is now cash-only. This means no debit or credit cards are taken but they conveniently have an ATM machine located in the lobby to not only dispense cash but charge a hefty $3 fee to use. If you want to have a refill on your drink, there is a charge for that too. Buying drinks by the pitcher is fine but it's soda...seriously? The pizza is alright, the salad bar is 1 trip only and is sparse at best.   The single saving grace of it all is the Organ. The piece de resistance. This is a good thing and a bad thing because given all that I've described, its simply not enough for me to drive an hour out of my way for an otherwise aggravating time between musical sets. While you're there, it makes those aggravating occurrences not quite so bad though because it's such a unique, memorable, interesting experience. I loved OSP as a child and enjoyed so many wonderful, memorable visits. Unfortunately, it's not always enough.

Nestled right next door to C-Fu Gourmet, it would be easy to miss this little gem but you really have to make an effort to try this place out if you enjoy sushi. The service was excellent and the menu was pretty expansive for such a small place.   Because I'm pregnant, I'm trying to limit my exposure to raw fish so I ordered the chicken teriyaki platter. It came with rice, soup, salad, and a full breast of teriyaki chicken. Unfortunately, my food arrived cold. I was disappointed but sucked it up so as not to embarrass our hosts. For this, I lowered my rating one star. Cold food is a pet peeve of mine.    My son and our hosts enjoyed the sushi and kept noting its freshness and great flavor. Hubby enjoyed the teriyaki ribs and his meal was served hot hot hot. Not sure what happened with mine, but oh well.   I'm looking forward to going back after my pregnancy so I can try out the sushi and hopefully the hot food will be hot.

Rarely do I give a 5 star review so please know that when I do, it's means something to me.   Flemings has come a really long way for me. It used to be just another trendy Scottsdale who's who of snob fests but either I'm lightening up with age or Flemings has grown from being just another Scottsdale steak place to being THE Scottsdale restaurant for steak and wine.   We went to Flemings this week to celebrate a birthday. The reservation process was easy because I could do it right online. I received a call the day before to confirm by a very nice young lady named Perla. She gave very good phone meaning she was polite, not overly chatty, and sounded enthusiastic about our visit.   Upon arrival, our party of 6 was greeted warmly by the hostesses and seated promptly. Our server and his assistant were attentive and friendly without being casual. Even my 8 year old was called "sir", which he totally loved. And while the rest of us were having a very nice Napa Valley red wine, our server was thoughtful enough to get my son a Shirley Temple so he could feel part of the big kids crowd. I know that traditionally Flemings is really meant for grown-ups but my kid has good taste and he behaves in a restaurant so he's golden. :)   Scott Yanni is the managing partner for Flemings and he made his way to our table to greet us and ensure our satisfaction for the evening. Scott treated us so kindly and was very gracious. Not often do you get to meet the managing partner of a restaurant, much less meet one who treats you like an old friend.   Now, the real reason you come to Flemings is for the steak. I ordered from the Winter Prix Fix menu which is a specialty menu being offered now. I had clam chowder for my starter. The chowder was so velvety and smooth with just the right amount of clam and potatoes. The nicest part about it is that it didn't smell fishy like some clam chowders do when the clams come from a can. Not so at Flemings. And of course, my pet peeve is the temperature of the soup. This soup came out piping hot and ready to roll. Love that!   My next course was a petite filet which came out among the row of plates my table had on the arm of our very skilled server. He had 6 dinner plates lined up his arm and never even came close to dropping them. It was a show in and of itself. Now back to that steak......it was like buttah as they say in the old country. It wasn't overly seasoned which was nice because some places try to mask the flavor of the meat with too much seasoning. This steak was a perfect medium rare and not a shade over or under. The side dishes were wonderful as well. We had mashed potatoes which were creamy and seasoned just right as well as the Flemings' potatoes, asparagus, and sauteed mushrooms. The Flemings' potatoes are definitely one of my favorites and were heavenly.   We rounded out the evening with desserts that were out of this world.  We had a chocolate lava cake that was so rich and moist that it melted in our mouths. We also enjoyed sorbet with chantilly cream as well and it was the perfect ending to a great meal.   Never once were we made to feel rushed or an inconvenience. Our servers were at our beck and call. Our water glasses were never empty and our food was served at just the perfect temperature. This visit was in a word.....Perfect.   Thank you Scott and the staff at Flemings for a memorable and wonderful evening!

Refused to book appointment for Digital Photography Workshop for Groupon customer. Have tried to book appointment for workshop 5 times and each time we get the runaround--anything from we're too busy to hold the class, not enough students to have the class, we're not booking anything right now call back in August, to we're not booking Groupon customers. The funny thing is that I even tested them to see if they just weren't booking at all or just not Groupon customers. As it turns out, when I wouldn't mention the Groupon, they had plenty of room and no problem booking! It's only when I mentioned the Groupon that it became an issue.   They sold over 300 of these Groupons to users. I can't imagine that we are the only ones who have been denied the ability to use our Groupon.   Very unprofessional and we do NOT recommend.

I gave birth to both of my sons at this hospital, first time 10 years ago, 2nd time was last Saturday. Both experiences were top notch but I will focus more on my 2nd experience since it is more fresh in my mind although both experiences were 5-star!  I had a scheduled C-section set up and received excellent pre-operative information from the hospital to prepare for the procedure. The check-in process was very well handled and all of my paperwork was already received, documented, and ready to go prior to our arrival. The surgical staff greeted me warmly and made me feel very at ease with the process. My husband and older son were both allowed to stay with me while we waited for the procedure time and my husband and son were both allowed to stay in the holding area while I had the procedure as well as welcome to join the nurses in the nursery when our baby was born. My husband is squeemish so he wasn't in the room with me during the procedure and never once did anyone make him feel bad about his preference.   I was allowed to bring my own CD to play music while my baby was being born and one of the nurses took photos immediately after my baby was born. The staff was kind, caring, and very professional the whole way through.  After the procedure and my arrival to my room, I was greeted and cared for by caring, professional aides and nurses the entire 3 days I spent at the hospital. The staff treated me like a friend or even a family member during my stay. I was fortunate enough to have a corner room which was enormous...which is good as we had a lot of visitors. There was no request too big or too small for the staff to handle and even during times when my care was a bit on the gross side, I was always treated professionally and with the utmost kindness. My baby was treated just like he was a member of the nurse's family and the staff never did anything with him without ensuring that I was very aware of exactly what, who, where, when, and how with my baby's care.   Surprisingly, the FOOD at the hospital was EXCELLENT. I don't know if other hospitals do this, but basically, food service is treated like room service. You call down to the cafeteria, place your order, and within 45 minutes, your food is brought right to your room. The food doesn't taste industrial...it's fresh, hot, and surprisingly good. I was very impressed.   I would and have recommended this hospital to my pregnant friends and I'm so glad that I chose Banner Thunderbird as my hospital of choice to give birth to my kids. Thank you Banner Thunderbird for the outstanding care and for making the birth of my children special and memorable.

I didn't expect to have to visit Banner Thunderbird again so soon after the birth of my son on 7/16 but an emergency arose that caused us to have to return with him. The pediatric ER was FANTASTIC. They made us feel at ease, were prompt with their care of our baby, and provided answers quickly with what our next steps were.   Ultimately, we had to stay overnight and stayed in the pediatric unit with our baby so here is part 2 of our visit....  The Peds unit is OUTSTANDING. Our nurses, Robyn and Jamie, were kind, understanding, and very professional. We were treated like friends rather than just patients. Our pediatricians during our stay was professional, nurturing, and didn't allow us to beat ourselves up over our baby's issue. But the best part of our visit was our tech, Mary. She treated our baby like he was one of her own kids and she treated us like royalty while we were there.   Though I'm not looking forward to having to go back to the hospital, I know that when I do have to go back, I will receive excellent, high quality, nurturing care from Banner Thunderbird Medical Center.

Had outpatient surgery recently in the Outpatient Surgicenter located right adjacent to the hospital. Lovely staff, clean facility, took me on time....couldn't have asked for a better experience! Always feel well cared for when I've had to utilize this facility.

I have been a patient of Dr. Sawyer's for over 13 years. I absolutely adore him. There is no kinder, gentler, and more understanding doctor than Dr. Sawyer as your OB/GYN. If you are having fertility issues, he can help. If you are looking for a great GYN, he is gentle and very professional. He also has a female PA and a female nurse practioner who see patients as well if you are more comfortable being seen by a woman.  Dr. Sawyer delivered my son 10 years ago and my entire pregnancy went smoothly and calmly thanks to the good doctor and his years of experience in OB. I'm excited to be having our 2nd miracle baby after all of these years and Dr. Sawyer is with us every step of the way.  Christy Brown is Dr. Sawyer's PA and she's terrific. I saw her many times after I had my son and she is friendly, sweet, and truly understands. She has given me great advice to help with various female issues and has always been right on. I've also seen the NP, Amy, a few times and she too is patient, kind, and understanding.   The office staff is very professional and treat you like an old friend. Many of the staff have been working there for at least as long as I've been seeing Dr. Sawyer. His PA and NP have been there for 10 years. You know an office is happy when there is low turnover.  I have never had to wait more than 30 minutes to see the doctor and as I've said, I've been seeing Dr. Sawyer for over 13 years.   Again, I can't say enough nice things about Dr. Sawyer and his practice. I've been 100% satisfied for years.

It has been quite a few years since I visited Picture People for portraits and in the past (pre-Yelp), my experiences were mediocre at best. Today we had a great experience and I'm pretty jazzed about how cool my 2 year old's pictures turned out.   What went well: **Online appointment process was EASY and problem-free **Started our session right on time **Only had to wait 30 minutes for prints to be ready **Got some very nice shots despite lack of connection with photographer **Great location--NOT in the mall anymore so a lot less distracting! **Decent pricing for packages **Prints were very clear and excellent quality  What I wish would be better when I have a portrait session is that the photographers be less stiff with kids. For a studio that specializes in child photography, my photographer and the other that was working while I was there were both just very stiff when working with kids. Kids won't warm up and genuinely smile if they don't connect with you. But then, most adults won't smile genuinely either if there's no connection. I had to work REALLY hard to get my boy to smile.   If you have a kid who doesn't smile on command or has a hard time warming up to strangers who are stiff around kids, keep this in mind when working with Picture People. Our portraits did come out beautifully, but not without a great deal of effort on my part.  I will definitely go back because of all the reasons I mentioned above though. The end certainly justified the means. :)

Rock Bottom indeed. At least that is the level of service you can expect at this location.  We went with our usual girls night out crew and sat outside on the patio. We sat for 15 minutes before a server even came over which was ok since we were chatting but we sure got thirsty. A server came over and asked if we had been helped yet and when we said no she said she was likely not going to be our server, but she'd take our drink order. Turns out, she was our server for the night. We could have done better serving ourselves at that rate. It took another 12 minutes to get our drinks. So yes, we were there 27 minutes before a beverage hit our table. Not a good start but this was my friend's choice as it was her birthday so I didn't complain.   Ultimately, it took our party of 5 more than 2 hours to eat dinner at Rock Bottom. We had 3 different appetizers which we took advantage of the happy hour prices. We had to remind the server that we were to get the 1/2 price appetizers when she brought our check. We had to beg for refills of drinks, ask where our dinners were, and it was like pulling teeth to get service. The food was ok at best but really the service was so horrible that I wouldn't recommend this place to an enemy.    Save yourself the hassle. There are plenty of places who do want your business enough to treat you right. It's funny too because the place was packed. They won't be packed with us anymore. We dropped over $130 there. Never again.

Based on our recent dinner, I don't think I'll ever go back to a Bill Johnson's restaurant...at least not for dinner. Breakfast there is pretty good and often times worth the miserable service, but dinner? Not again.  We went recently.  Took 20 minutes for salads to come out of the kitchen. I don't know what's going on back there, but the restaurant was NOT full and there was no need for it to take 20 minutes. Salad is the basic bagged salad, a couple of grape tomatoes with dressing in little portion cups. How hard is that to put together and why did it take 20 minutes? A question for the ages I'm afraid.   Our server was moody. She went from being friendly and interested to not filling a drink on our table in the 20 minutes it took her to get our salads out. She ignored us when she did come out of the kitchen to attend to her other tables. When she did bring the food, Dr. Jekyell appeared again and she was nice as could be and filled our drinks, only to disappear again while we ate. Thank goodness we didn't need anything because we weren't getting it.   I ordered the Ribeye special. Since I received my education in the culinary field, I can confidently say that the piece of meat I received was NOT a ribeye. Since it took so long to come out of the kitchen though, I suffered through once again thinking of my motto to NOT eat at chain restaurants again.... There was so much fat on this piece of meat that I made a neat litle pile of it on my plate for the server to notice. She noticed but said nothing.  The mashed potatoes were instant potatoes and the corn on the cob was over-cooked and dry. But it was only $12.99.  Oh and don't bother with the $2.99 margarita special. You get what you pay for and that's not saying much.   I've given Bill Johnson's many a try over the years because back when I was a kid, this was a great restaurant to go to and the food was always really good. As of today....I think the only way they stay in business is because of their breakfast. It sure ain't the dinner or the service.   I am hoping this is my last visit to Bill Johnson's but alas, I'll probably try them again in a few months hoping that they will be like they were years ago, but I'm sure reality will kick me in the gut again, much like the crappy dinner we had on Friday night. *sigh*

I have been to this zoo several times over the years and finally FINALLY had a good visit. I'm not sure what the problem was before...I just found this zoo boring to the point where I hadn't even seen the whole zoo until now. That having been said, my most recent visit was an eye-opening, very fun visit. The variety of animals was excellent though they do seem to have a ridiculous number of birds. The aquarium is fun too.  Pros: Large variety of animals Small yet intimate animal enclosures make for a more intimate visit with the animals. Friendly staff  Cons: EXPENSIVE $30/adult admission, $15/child 3-12. Too many additional charges to nickle and dime.  Snack bars don't take debit and ATMS are not readily available small animal enclosures make you feel like the animals are stifled...but then it IS a zoo afterall.

Over the years, this zoo has REALLY improved. I remember when it first opened there were hardly any animals but this little zoo in the far west valley has really blossomed.   I love how much closer to the animals you are, the interaction with the animals, the variety of exhibits...what I don't love is the price. It's expensive at $30/adult and every other attraction at the zoo is costly. There is nothing under $2.50/person with most things at least $4-$5/person to experience. And bring cash because there is only 1 ATM and it's usually out of cash and the attractions and snack bars are cash only which they don't tell you at the front door.  Given the cost of admission, I think the membership of $100 is well worth it if you plan to come more than once. I will be back and will be buying the membership next time.

We got a giftcard for Christmas so we thought we'd give Applebees another try.  My son actualy insisted I write this review during our dinner so some of this review will contain his words.  Caught up to hubby and son at Applebees after a PTA meeting and they had already ordered appetizers. The cheesesticks were pretty basic. Cheesy, crispy, and not bad though the marinara was bland. The steak quesadilla thing was decent too. I'm sorry I don't know exactly what its called...that's what son called it. It was like a burrito though and not a quesadilla but I don't care enough to go look. Again, the flavor was ok, but just not sure what to expect.  Dinner however was just blah. Hubby and our friend each ordered the Quesadilla burger. Both said it was totally bland. Hubby had coleslaw which was overdressed. Friend had french fries which were crispy and hot but bland. Hubby added mayo and ketchup and that still didn't help the burger though.   I had the 3 cheese chicken penne. Bland. Thank god they put diced tomatoes in it or there wouldn't be any color to it either. The pasta was overcooked and also appeared to have been sitting around in another vessel before I got it because it was very oddly bent for penne.  My son had a rueben. He's used to the ruebens at Archie's Deli which are A-MAZING. This one at Applebees was so very salty that he couldn't eat it. The meat wasn't fresh and the saurkraut was clearly from a can. He was very disappointed and after 3 bites informed me that I better Yelp this restaurant because it's TERRIBLE and people need to know.  Now the only saving grace was our server. I didn't catch her name but she was friendly, polite, unintrusive, and kept our drinks filled. She brought the food out while it was hot rather than letting it sit in the window and the crappy food wasn't her fault at all. That's the only reason Applebees didn't get 1 star.

My stylist recently moved to this salon. It's definitely interesting to see the difference in clientle that visit stores on Grand Ave versus Bell Rd. Let's just say I was the youngest guest in the salon by at least 40 years. BUT--the quality of service was EXCELLENT at Sarai. I was welcomed warmly, offered a beverage while I waited for my stylist and got to observe very kind, professional service all around. The salon is super clean, nicely decorated and has a good number of work stations. The salon was bustling for a Wednesday morning but then again, given that the clientle is mostly retired ladies, it made sense. Although I tend to move when my stylist moves, I'm glad she's found a home here because its quite a nice family-owned place!

I'm not the one that usually takes the cars in for a wash as I find it to be an annoying process. I don't like being hit up for oil changes, glass replacement, or getting the heavy handed pressure to upsize the wash. None of that happened at TNT and man was that refreshing!   Yelp check-in got me $4 off on my VIP wash which was a bonus!   Prompt, friendly service, no high pressure sales, and my car done right the first time--boy should Cobblestone and Classic Auto Spa take note!

Solid visits since my original 3/31 visit and I am happy about the consistent service I receive here.  While I have been solicited a few times for auto glass repair by a guy who finds taking no difficult, it is overall a very nice location to visit.  Service is prompt, no high pressure sales to upgrade my wash or service, my truck is done right the first time and the lobby is very nice with a big viewing window to watch the cars go through the wash. Gotta love the $4 off with the Yelp che

The little blurb when you select your star pretty much sums it up...Meh. I've experienced better.   While the place is usually packed at breakfast time, the service is blah and the food is a bit pricey considering it's just IHOP. The healthy choices are limited and like I said...meh....whatever.

I've sat on writing this review for about a week now trying to decide what I wanted to say and how I wanted to rate this....well that and I was busy, ok?   Anyway, took some family members and a couple of kids to the Lobster on a Monday evening. With the SnowBirds stil in town, this place was busy. What was supposed to only be a 25 minute wait was actually a 45 minute wait and after telling them we were leaving, a table suddenly came available. Imagine that....  Our server was....confident. His introduction to us included a detailing of his excellence in service and went on for a couple of minutes while the kids squirmed. We ordered our drinks and away we went.   Now Mr. Excellence in Service wasn't so excellent. Maybe it was because he was the only server in our section and he had 7 tables with at least 4 people at each table. I imagine that was because he had bragged to the manager how awesome he was and that he could handle it because normally at chains, the managment has policies about the number of tables a server can have. But I digress. Our drinks would be empty for a while before he would get around to us. And to top it off, he forgot to order our appetizer that he himself said he LOVED and was his favorite. Our salads took FOREVER to arrive and when our meals came, one of my companions and I who had ordered the same item didn't get the right item. Very disappointing. When Mr. Excellence in Service was called over and we told him about the missing appetizer as well as the two dishes that were incorrect, he almost broke down in tears right at the table! WTF?   Anyway, we explained to him that we would eat our dinners but wanted a discount and wanted to be sure the app was not on our bill. He seemed fine with that and apologized about 200 times. Then the manager comes over. Clearly this woman has been beaten down by customers one too many times because she was nearly in tears as well. We weren't even mad...we just wanted to be sure we were billed correctly. She offered to put the missing item in a to-go box for us to enjoy later....again WTF? But she did give us free dessert, comp'd us a dinner and made sure the appetizer wasn't on our bill...which is all we wanted.   The food itself was fine...typical Red Lobster fare. Nothing overly special. The kids were happy with their food. I just wanted to be sure we didn't get billed for stuff we didn't get. But Mr. Excellence was so broken up about screwing up our table after all his bravado, he hardly returned until he brought us the bill where he apologized again so profusely even my 8 year old was like Dude, get a hold of yourself.   The saving grace of this experience was the comp'd dinner and free desserts. Yes I'll likely go back to Red Lobster because dammit I like that shrimp and lobster pasta. It beckons me every so often and I can't shake it.   If you go to this Red Lobster, expect a wait and expect substandard service, but at least you know the shrimp and lobster pasta won't disappoint you.

We used this Rubio's location for a fundraiser we had this year for our school. FANTASTIC staff, friendly service, and the food is great. Very generous portions and fresh, hot and yummy. You will never eat at Taco Bell, Del Taco or any of the Filiberto's spin offs ever again.   The restaurant is always clean and you can count on a good experience every time. :)

Absolutely LOVE Peter Piper and have enjoyed this facility for years. Surprised I haven't YELP'd it before now but I guess it just never struck me to do so.   Great games that are always working. Easy for the littler ones to get tickets for the toys that you could buy in the dollar store but end up spending $20 to get...but I digress.   Pizza is addictive. I CRAVE the California Veggie which is my favorite and although it doesn't always fit in my diet plans, I do try to have it about once a month.  I've also had the wings, salads, and even the soft serve ice cream. All is very good.  I've been to birthday parties here, held meetings here, and even had fundraisers here all with lots of success. This Peter Piper is very good to the community as well offering plenty of donations and opportunities to reward kids in schools.    The staff here is friendly and nice. The management is helpful and eager to please.  All around 5 star location.

All in all, I'd say this was pretty darn good visit. Our server was super friendly and patient with my "elderly" father-in-law who is quite needy when it comes to his pizza and drinks.   My son and I shared the DBacks Triple Play which is sausage with carmelized onion and sweet red pepper. It was delish--though I will dare say that it's better when you have it at Chase Field with a beer and watching the Dbacks live..but I digress. My husband had the #1 which is a sandwich called Still The One. Father-in-law had super thin crust sausage pizza and mother-in-law had some sort of chicken dish. We were all pleasantly pleased with our choices and as mentioned, our server was excellent.   I am definitely thinking another visit to SONY will need to take place soon! Thanks for the great visit!

Once again you get the husband/wife review, but so be it. :)  I go to Butcher Bob's all the time for my catering as well as home cooking needs. They have the freshest, best cuts of meat and are very reasonable in price. And of course it's fresh--they cut it right on premises!   The nicest part about Butcher Bob's is that you are dealing with knowledgeable people who want you to get exactly what you are looking for in a cut of meat. I've called them for specialty orders and the very next day, they've got it taken care of for me. They take time to explain about the cuts to you and the pros and cons of using one type versus another. They don't try to talk you into buying anything more expensive than what you truly need. They will even give you ideas and suggestions for preparation.   Now your local supermarkets, they don't cut meat on premises anymore so you can't ask the butcher at Fry's to make you a paillard of chicken breast. They simply don't have the tools and in many cases, the know-how to get it done. You have to go to a real Butcher shop like Butcher Bob's to get what you really need.   If you are looking for the best cuts of meat along with a little help in your preparation when you are preparing your next special meal, go to Butcher Bob's. They will definitely put your mind at ease and you will be amazed at the delicious flavor of freshly cut meats.

I went to Sarah's Hallmark yesterday for their Holiday sale and was very disappointed with the bait and switch tactics going on with the Vera Bradley bags. They were offering in their sale print ad one style of bag but when I got to the store, that bag was NOT the one they were offering with the sale price. And it wasn't because they didn't have it either!  When I asked the clerk about the proper price of the bag, she insisted that the owners made a mistake but that she couldn't offer the bag that was pictured at the discounted price. I told her this was bait and switch and asked her to call the owners to clarify. She wouldn't do it. You have to sell the bag pictured at the discounted price...plain and simple. Very disappointing.

It's Target...what's not to love? The one thing that I can say isn't worth while at this location is the fresh section of the grocery store. Its over-priced AND I have noticed several things that were past expiration in the cases. I have also had several things go bad within a day of purchase. Beyond that--it's Target--what's not to love? ;)

Oh Harkins...how I do love thee versus that of your evil competitor Ultra Star. I can always count on fresh popcorn, clean floors, and roomy theaters. Thank you for your loyalty programs to reward those of us who frequent your establishments and for offering a variety of pricing options that don't force us to jump through hoops to meet.   The kids who work here are nice, make eye contact, and seem to like their jobs. The theaters and bathrooms are kept clean.   All in all I can always count on a good visit at this Harkins location!

To say we love the Challenger Space Center would be an understatement but there is no adjective to really describe how much we enjoy visiting this great museum!   The volunteers, the staff, and the sponsors have created a mecca for science and space lovers. And even if you aren't that into space and science, you will find something interesting and enjoyable to see at the center.  My son attended their Space Camp this past summer and it was very professionally done. He went on two space simulations where they got to go to Mars and the International Space Station. He got to learn how rockets are made and actually shoot them off on the roof of the building. He learned about solar energy and made a solar box to make smores. It really worked! He had an absolutely blast and is looking forward to going back this summer.  We loved the program so much, we had his birthday party there and did a space simulation. All the kids had a great time and still talk about it today!   We recently went to a workshop with actual NASA Astronauts who shared with us their personal videos and experiences in space. It was amazing!  I can't say enough great things about the Challenger Space Center and I hope you will go check it out sometime soon!

I really try to avoid chain restaurants whenever humanly possible but sometimes, it's unavoidable; especially when you have kids. I do my best to avoid them because you always get the same service and food....and sometimes that's NOT a good thing.   Case in point...The Red Robin.  We went to Red Robin at Arrowhead this week and it was blah at best. We live near the Red Robin on Bell road just west of Litchfield Rd which is crap at best, but we happened to be near the mall and went here instead.   We went with a group of 6 of us. Our server was standard and did the bare minimum. Most of us ordered burgers, except my son who always orders the chicken fingers. It's a kid thing. I prefer not to eat red meat unless I'm going to a high end steak restaurant so I ordered a Guacamole Bacon Burger with a turkey patty. I don't know why I do this to myself because 99% of the time, it's a frozen turkey patty that is so overly salted it's practically inedible and that's pretty much how this one was too.  Normally I get the Red Robin Gourmet burger with a turkey patty and I'm fortunate enough that all the toppings mask the flavor of the patty. Not so much with the Guacamole burger. Now, you would expect that on a guacamole burger, there would be a good amount of guac on the burger since you probably aren't putting ketchup, mustard, etc on the burger. Not so. It was a chinzy amount of guac with 2 fatty slices of bacon on top of an over salted turkey patty. All this for under $10...lucky me.  Now, I don't know what's going on at Red Robin lately, but they used to give you a substantial amount of steak fries in the plastic basket of fun. The last couple times I've been, I get like 5 fries and then I have to ask for more which takes way too long and I'm ready for the check by the time they come out. I'm glad the fries are unlimited, but give me enough to work with if you aren't going to wow me with your lack of stellar service.  Now the one thing I really do enjoy about RR is the freckled lemonade. It's tasty, cold, and most of the time it comes out in neat twisted glasses. I say most of the time because they don't ever have enough twisted glasses clean to keep the glass consistent with the beverage. By the time I'm ready for my 3rd glass, I'm getting the basic soda cup. Gee. thanks.  So, I'll keep going back to RR because my son enjoys it and because I'm clearly a glutton for punishment. But that doesn't mean I gotta like it.

Enjoyed a very nice meal here tonight with my party of 13 for my grandfather's birthday. Love the selection of pastas and even more so, the selection of non-pastas as well! Not every place will offer spaghetti squash, low fat marinara and veggies for those of us watching our calories. The pizza was delicious, the lasagna was very tasty. The chicken parm was perfectly done. Our server, Ashley, did a great job keeping up with all our drinks and needs.The only thing I wish was different was that we should have been put in a more private location due to the size of our party. Instead, we were parked right smack dab in the center of the dining room. Kind of made it difficult to talk with our other family members as it was pretty busy. Overall though, I was very impressed and look forward to a future visit!

It's Denny's--how bad can it be? Well let me tell you...this visit to Denny's was B.A.D. It was over 90 minutes from start to finish and we were seated immediately on a weekday morning. Food came out S.L.O.W and our server was even slower. We didn't get refills nor were they even offered. My husband's pancakes were burnt on the outside and still runny on the inside. The fruit that came with my breakfast had been frozen and wasn't quite thawed out yet. I have eaten at this Denny's before and while the service has never been all that stellar, this was by far the worst visit to a Denny's I've ever experienced and because it's Denny's my expectations are pretty low to begin with. Do yourself a favor and skip this particular Denny's. You will save yourself the aggravation.

I have visited this location COUNTLESS times over the years so I'm surprised I hadn't reviewed it until now.   The food here is fresh, properly tempered, and the store is VERY clean...well except the bathroom. The bathroom is always a disaster. I'm not sure why. Even after the remodel, the women's bathroom always is sticky, dirty, and just makes me feel like I need to go shower afterwards. It's weird.   The staff is usually very nice and friendly but they get very frazzled when the place is busy...and this location is BIZ-EEE. When the snowbirds come and especially during Spring Training, this store is PACKED. As a local, I usually skip ST's lunch time mid-February through beginning of April because it's just too busy.   All in all though, this is a good location with consistently good food.  The only other aspect of this store that prevents it from getting 5 stars is that Sweet Tomatoes is ridiculously over priced. It's soup and salad for goodness sake. It shouldn't cost me $25 for 2 people to eat soup and salad with a drink. But that's just me. :)

Welcoming, clean, and a wonderful place to snuggle with my little guy and read books while we pass time. The staff is friendly and kind. The Starbucks guy was funny and helpful. Overall a nice visit.   The one thing I wish that businesses (and this BN is guilty of it) WOULD NOT do is put the changing table in the handicap stall. There was a woman in the handicap stall for...no joke...45 minutes. I had to take my boy out to the car to change him as I sure won't change him on a pad on a public restroom dirty yucky floor. I wouldn't have had to do that on a 113 degree day though if the darn changing table was outside the handicap stall. And the reason I know it was 45 minutes? We went in to the bathroom right at our arrival and had to use it again 45 minutes later. Same lady in the stall. And yes, she was ok. Or so she said.   So, if you have kids, keep this in mind when using the rest room, otherwise enjoy a very nice experience at this BN location.

I'm spoiled by the old location we had here in Surprise where the staff was fun, friendly, and on point. This location, the staff is indifferent, in a rush, and don't even make eye contact with you when you order. I really hate that.   The menu is the same and the food is good. But the staff is what really makes this location a 2 star joint. They really need to get a personality!

Frankly, one star is even too generous for our visit recently to Abuelos at Arrowhead. What used to be a fun and delicious place to eat has dwindled down to being just an absolute dump.   The restaurant was filthy. Someone had actually dropped one of their flossers on the floor in the lobby and the hostesses just walked by it over and over again. There was trash in the faux planters and there were actually still Christmas decorations in a couple of random spots in the faux plants surrounding the dining area. There were dirty tables that just sat dirty all around the dining area. Sorry but that's unacceptable.   The server was friendly...sort-of. He sold us on an appetizer and then didn't bother to put it in! I think he was put out that our party of 3 decided to share the fajita trio rather than ordering 3 seperate dishes. The fajita trio is HUGE and it easily feeds our family. Our drinks were never refilled...our chip bowl sat empty so long it started to get cobwebs on it.   Overall, this was a grossly disappointing visit to a restaurant that once was respectable, clean, and had pride. There is clearly no pride left in this Abuelos. I think I'll just stick to the dives here in El Mirage....at least they care about their customers and their reputations.

Been here for a variety of events and always enjoyed this venue. I wish the ladies room was a little more accessible but beyond that, the seats are comfy, the stage is easy to view no matter where you sit, and the people who work here are actually helpful. Have yet to have a bad experience!

Holy crap! This is hands-down the best dive I've ever visited for Mexican food. You will not find a better place. When you pull up, you'll be skeptical...trust me. Try it.   The restaurant is cash only and the dining area is outside, screened porch. Again, put that aside. You're not here because of any of that.  You are here because of the food. The food. The fresh made tortillas. The hand pulled chicken, the perfectly seasoned steak. The rice and beans that are lovingly made fresh daily.   My son had the red chili burrito and has said on more than one occasion that it changed his life. He gets a far-away look on his face whenever he talks about it.   The place is PACKED during the week with business people and on weekends--even more packed with locals. They know something you don't know yet...but you will...Norteno is the bomb. Go. Now. Seriously.

I graduated in 2000 from AIPX as a culinary arts student and although this review isn't about my education experiences there, I can say I received a 4 star education there. This review is about my experience having lunch recently in the Gallery Cafe.   My friend, my sons, and I enjoyed a delicious lunch on Friday which included one of the tastiest cabbage soups I've ever had. We enjoyed leg of lamb as well as short ribs for our entrees and the bread was incredible. The student server although a little slow did a very good job in his presentation and had a very clear understanding of what was being served, how it was prepared, and offered suggestions based on the questions we had.   I look forward to a return visit to the cafe and

To have the ability to accommodate a 35 person reservation on a Friday evening is to go above and beyond in their ability to provide good service. We had 2 servers who worked VERY hard to keep our drinks full. Our food was served hot, on time, and the could not have been better.   Our fajitas were DELISH--to the point where all of our first timers in the group said they will DEFINITELY be back.    Thank you Fajitas for going above and beyond!

Delicious breakfast and very accommodating to larger parties.  I had the Triathlete and it was more than enough, very flavorful, and great option for a person being mindful of calories.  Love that we had hot coffee right at the table the whole time versus the server allowing the carafe to get cold. Our server was very nice and we will definitely be back soon--I am really wanting to try the breakfast tacos!

Although I'm a resident of Arizona, I stayed here this past weekend as part of a Convention of about 300 people. We had a wonderful visit. The rooms are clean, the hallways are kept neat without the clutter of room service dishes. The meeting rooms, albeit a little on the small size, were modern, well air-conditioned, and the staff was very available to help with set up and clean up. The food during our lunches was very good....in fact, above average for banquet food. I would definitely recommend the Sheraton Crescent for your convention needs.  I hope we have our event there next year!

Since the sale of and subsequent closure of Paesanos on 43rd Ave and T-bird, I've been in search of a replacement. While nothing will really be Paesanos, Pizza by Napoli is a decent enough substitute in the Glendale area that satisfies the craving and doesn't make leave you disappointed.   Crust is just crusty on the outside with a little doughiness on the inside...just right. The sauce is just the right balance of acid and sweet. The cheese is very fresh and not overwhelming. The pepperoni wasn't greasy at all so you know that they get the good stuff. Overall, a nice pie that makes you look forward to more!

What a fun little place in Scottsdale! My family went for breakfast this morning and enjoyed chocolate chip pancakes, little piggies, egg white omelets, and biscuits and gravy. All were delicious. In fact, while I make some pretty darn good pancakes, I will admit that these are better than mine. So much so, that I can't wait to go back. The service was excellent, friendly, and prompt. Looking forward to our next visit!

Decided to give Frank & Lupe's another shot since we were heading to Brush Bar again for an evening of painting fun. Disappointed doesn't even begin to cut it.   The service was indifferent, rude, and was clearly not interested in us just like the previous visit. We were seated right in the main dining room so no matter what our server had to do, he had to walk by us each and every time. He forgot drinks, food was served to us cold, didn't even bring the appetizer we ordered. If he tried any harder to ignore us, it would have been downright funny.   The biggest turn off was the glass of water he served to one of my dinner guests which was rimmed with ANTS. It was almost like they dipped the rim of the glass into a whole pile of the dead ants before serving it. How he missed it, I'll never know. It was disgusting. Not an apology. Not a discount offered. Nothing.   This was the most piss-poor service I have received in a restaurant in a long time and you can bet your last dime it's the last time Frank & Lupe's will ever see me or the 8 other guests I brought.

We have dined here many times and have always had a wonderful experience. My husband prefers his steaks well done...with ketchup (YES, I know....) and never do they make him feel funny about it and they ALWAYS cook it perfectly. Our last visit I had the chilean sea bass. That is a fish that is so easy to overcook and mine was PERFECT.  The salads are always served chilled and the hot dishes are always always hot.   Can't go wrong with the potatoes au gratin though any one of the side dishes will do because they are all yum. Desserts are also delicious but usually we are so full from dinner that we just can't make dessert work.   The staff is attentive, friendly and pleasant without being overbearing. That's a biggie for me. Some servers just want to be besties and I just want to eat....  Definitely recommend this location and be sure to set a reservation or it'll be a long wait!

After 2 fantastic visits to the Persian Room, I feel very good about giving 5 stars on this imaginative place.    There are lots of appetizer options but if you don't get the eggplant hummus you are missing out on a slice of heaven that no one knew existed. It is PERFECTION. Warm pita bread along with persian spices and fresh sweet onion make it just that much better. Seriously--you can eat this onion by the slice and not worry about bad breath. It's awesome.  We shared the #49 Persian Room platter is perfect for sharing and features some of the best choices on the menu. From the inventive koobideah, beef barq and the chicken filet served with delicious basmati rice, you just can't go wrong. I recommend asking for 1/2 rice, 1/2 Persian Room salad (which is basically a Greek style salad) as there is still more rice than you could possibly eat, even with a 1/2 size portion.  The first time we went, we ate upstairs by the bar, which was actually more interesting than the main dining room, mostly because you got a great view of the street and all that was going on. The second visit we were in the far larger overflow seating area, despite having had a reservation. It was packed both times with all walks of life visiting the restaurant.   The service staff was excellent offering suggesting to new timers, even remembering names of those returning for new visits.  I always like when you can go to a  place and the people remember your name. :)   Definitely try the Persian Room. Deliciousness in a genie bottle!

We hit up Pita Jungle before we headed to Gammage for a play last night and although it's not our first time to Pita Jungle, it was our first time to THIS Pita Jungle.   The 5 stars is based on the awesome service experience we had. The food is always good, but Kevin, our server, was kind, polite, friendly, and helpful. But what really put it over the top was his very thoughtful gesture of bringing my son club soda and a cloth when my son inadvertently spilled food on his tie without even being asked. He even helped him get his tie clean. It's this kind of simple, yet sweet gesture that gets ya a big tip and Kevin earned every cent of it.  Pita Jungle's food is delish. We had the hummus for an appetizer, just the basic hummus. It was creamy, flavorful, and the warm pitas were perfection. My son and I also had the chicken schwarma pita...our favorite. The chicken was perfectly done, not overly sauced, and the pita again was warm and wonderful. We finished the meal with a baklava sundae. OMG...I will be back if only for the sundae alone! Warm baklava with ice cream and chocolate sauce? YES PLEASE!   The restaurant was super clean with lots of local art on the walls. The open floor plan made it very welcoming and bright without allowing for it to get too loud.   Thank you so much for a great experience. We don't get to Tempe often, but we will definitely make a point to visit this Pita Jungle when we are there again!

I realize that the Improv and Stand Up Live are owned by the same peeps, but I've got to say, Tempe Improv, albeit an older establishment, is better than SUL. The staff is friendly and not overly imposing. They don't try to trick you into the souvenir glasses that you don't need/want. They don't get too pushy with the upsales. They don't walk in front of you nearly as much as SUL though they have changed from their previous policy of not serving during the headliner which I dislike and they lost a star over. We enjoyed dinner the last visit to see Bill Belamy and it was pretty darn good. Not OMG but definitely do-able. The comedians we've seen were excellent and we will definitely be back.   The other reason why I removed a star is that they have a DJ now to entertain before the show. I'm not sure if that was just for Bill Belamy or if that's the regular scene but it prevents your group from having any conversation because it's so darn loud. It's a good idea, but maybe turn it down a little so friends/dates can talk!   Please stop with service during the headliner though. It's distracting to everyone--including the headliners. I realize you make money off of your ridiculously over priced drinks but seriously.

I purposely didn't read the Yelp reviews before coming here so that I wouldn't have any preconceived notions about this place. I wanted to check this place out with fresh eyes. Some of my points here have been shared many times over in previous reviews but again, I purposely didn't read them so this review is from my eyes as a "virgin" visitor.  My son and I came here last night before heading to Gammage for a play. My first thought upon entering was "Am I in the wrong the place?" Haji-Baba is a small ethnic market as well as having a small eatery inside. It is an older store and the restaurant is off to the far right side of the store. In fact, the restaurant seems like an afterthought. There are very old tables and chairs, with the cheapest silverware, napkins, plates and glasses that the restaurant supply stores carry. There is no personality to this part of the store at all. And while that isn't entirely a bad thing because I'm not afraid to visit a dive restaurant, in the case of Haji-Baba, this was just a sign of things to come.   Despite being severely overdressed, we were seated at a nearby table by a polite man who came across like one of the owners. Unfortunately, he was not our server. Our server was a man who was barely audible when he did speak to us, which was nominal at best; which is to say that he said just enough to get our order and then never came back again. Our dinners came out in less than 5 minutes..which seemed very surprising to me. Although our dishes are not complex, nor is the menu as there are limited selections at Haji-Baba, I thought that there might be a little more effort, especially now that I've read so many other reviews on this place. The food was clearly pre-made and just scooped on the plate. I guess that's ok and maybe I'm spoiled and used to cooked-to-order food lately. Hard to say.  The food itself was pretty good. My schwarma plate came with tabouli, hummus, rice, schwarma and 1/2 of a pita. My son's beef schwarma had rice, greek salad and schwarma. No hummus for him and he had the other 1/2 of my pita. Both of the schwarmas were fine. It was nothing special. I've had better and I've had worse. The hummus was creamy though kind of bland and the pitas were warm and flavorful...when we got more! Our first one was kind of blah. The rice was just plain white rice. The Greek salad was way overdressed to the point of soggy. The tabouli was nice though with just the right amount of crunch.   Overall, this would have been a 3 star review if not for the lackluster service we received. Our server had zero personality. He never came back to check on us though he stopped at several tables near us to give them a "thumbs up" to check on them so maybe it was just us and the fact that we were dressed up that put him off. I thought initially that he might not have been comfortable speaking English as clearly most of the staff here were European but he spoke beautifully to the tables around us. Our drink vessels were bone dry. I had to flag down the guy who seated us to get extra pitas and refills on our drinks. Next time I'm in Tempe, I'll go the 1/2 mile up the street to Pita Jungle for Mediterranean food. The service was better and the food had some heart put into the process of preparation. Haji-Baba was, in a word, forgettable and that's kind of a shame because with a little work, it could be the 5 star place that so many people on here seem to think it is.

After 2 years, you'd think that a place might improve a bit...alas it did not.  The service on our recent visit was S-L-O-W.  And by slow, I mean that I suspect that the kitchen was still plucking the feathers off the chicken when I ordered by kebabs. Our server had suggested that the schwarma would take at least 30 minutes to prepare and in retrospect, I should have ordered it anyway based on the length of time it took for our order to arrive. And it was NOT busy.  Drinks again were left bone dry. I tried the yogurt soda which was DISGUSTING. Skip it. The food was just meh and the service was yet again, lackluster at best.   I will not be back to Haji Baba. 2 chances and between the meh food and the lackluster service, I just can't see giving more of my time or effort to a place that doesn't seem to want to put in time or effort.

This review is on the portrait studio only though I am a fan of this particular JCPenney store.   It had been YEARS since we've done a professional family portrait for Christmas so with Groupon offering such an amazing deal, I couldn't pass it up. The studio waiting area is fairly roomy considering the amount of people packed in bright and early on Black Saturday. The employees were all friendly and cheerful. We were taken right on time for our photos. Our photographer was EXCELLENT. She asked great questions about what we were looking for in background, poses, and "theme". She had a way with the kids and got the baby to smile every single time. Our pictures looked great. The young man helping me select our portraits for our package was helpful, patient, and gave great suggestions without being pushy. He didn't try to get me to buy more than I was comfortable with and he was very patient while I picked out our photos. Our photos were ready about a week later and pick up was easy and pain-free.  The only reason this isn't a 5 star review is because this studio is EXPENSIVE. Had I not had a Groupon, our bill would have easily been over $400 on portraits and still wouldn't have gotten the photo CD as that was even pricier. Even with the Groupon I still spent $160 on my own.   All in all this was an excellent experience and I will definitely consider JCPenney Portrait Studio again in the future, but I admit that I might balk a little simply because of the price.

I've ordered cookies from Cookies by Design many times and they never disappoint. I have worked with this store as well as stores across the country when ordering for the people I work with and people I love. Everyone has always said how beautiful the cookies look but even better, how great they taste. You won't be disappointed. :)

Always a good time bowling here. From the outside, it's a bit rundown and the neighborhood is a bit older as well, but the inside is clean, bright, and welcoming. The snack bar needs help as the last couple of times we went, the cook was ridiculously slow. We just wanted cheese sticks and it took 45 minutes...and there were only 4 other lanes being used at the time!   All in all, good family fun with great offers if you sign up for their email list and friend them on Facebook!

I have been a Desert School FCU customer for 20+ years. I have NEVER had an issue, not even once, when dealing with DSFCU.  If there is a mistake, they immediately correct it. If I make a mistake, it's not a condescending "told ya so" mannerism. I have a vehicle loan with DSFCU as well and the rate I received was the best around. The staff at this location is always very helpful despite the fact that they are dealing with the elderly on a regular basis. I always am treated in a calm, cool, and professional manner no matter who I work with at DSFCU.

Although the staff here is very very nice, the food at best is just meh....I visited recently with a friend and found the menu and food to be uninspired. I ordered the soup, salad and breadsticks. First of all, it bagged salad and about a cup of it at that. It's not a bread stick, it's a slice of garlic toast. And the soup, the soup was pretty good. It was semi-homemade chicken noodle soup. It's not unlimited but it is only $5. You do get what you pay for in that respect.  My friend ordered the mostaccoli with meatsauce and salad. The pasta was overdone and the meatsauce was pretty salty.   I suppose for the older crowd that this place attracts in Sun City, this food is great, but honestly, it was nothing special. It wasn't bad...it just wasn't good either.

Those who read my reviews know that I am a sucker for a good kitschy dive. There is no better, no kitschier dive than Chang Lee. It's quintessential, over the top decor always makes me smile and for those who turn their nose up to such things, you don't know what you're missing. The food at Chang Lee is delish. It is authentic, well seasoned, and served at all the right temps. Love that you can order the special and it comes with egg roll and chicken wings. The staff is friendly, polite, and attentive. Love that it's family owned and operated. I have come here many times over the years and I look forward to going back soon.

Nice car-wash with reasonable prices and decently friendly staff. I can tell the staff is used to dealing with the older gentleman types versus the hip and fun 30-something female SUV driving Mom types, but that's ok. The Mom-mobile was detailed just right, the wait wasn't too long, and the air freshener lasted more than 1/2 a day.   Way way better than Cobblestone Spa over on Bell Rd.

Good pizza at a reasonable price that's NOT a chain! What more can you ask for? Service is good and the pizza is great. The only downfall is that you have to deal with the Sun City-ers which makes visiting the restaurant annoying. Beyond that, the restaurant itself is clean and simply set up and the food is very good.

Not impressed at all. The waitress kept interjecting herself into our conversations. The drinks were empty most of the time. The food was clearly not fresh made. Salad came from a bag. And who splits a hotdog lengthwise and serves it on a piece of bread for a kid's meal? Seriously?   What's confusing about this place, and many places in SCW is that the people come here in droves. When you get old, do you somehow lose your tastebuds entirely or are you just willing to accept cheap crap because it's cheap? I just don't understand it. But I will say if my in-laws suggest it again, it will be met with a resounding NO.

If I could do 3.5 stars, that would really be more accurate of a rating. While I do like Dr. Pham and Dr. Marcelo very much, the office staff can be a little touch and go.The front office receptionists are downright unfriendly. We had an emergency situation with my son's circumcision and all they cared about was collecting my co-pay rather than getting us back to see the doctor as urgently as possible. The back-office staff are a little nicer but haven't bothered to get to know my name and are a bit stand-offish at best with the kids. This is kind of a pet peeve for me. My name is not "Mom" well at least not what adults should call me. I should be called by my name...especially if I'm the one paying the bill. Additionally, when you are working with kids, you should be enthusiastic, friendly, and kind. It would put all the kids more at ease.   Because I like Dr. Pham and Dr. Marcelo so much, I'll continue to come back to Surprise Peds but bear in mind that the office staff could use some work on their people skills.

While I am very surprised to be the first to review this fabulous Italian eatery, I also find it to be a pleasure as well!  Nestled in the heart of Carefree's shopping centers and eateries on Easy Street located right next to a nail salon is this quaint, elegant, and sophisticated little restaurant. Inside there are about 15-20 tables. I had made a reservation for our party of 4 not knowing how busy it would be on a Friday evening at 7 in Carefree and I'm glad I did. This joint was hopping!  We were given water and a basket of delicious toasted and warm bread with an herb butter. I'm so tired of those "trendy" places that think Olive Oil and balsamic is a proper topping on bread.  Not so at Giordano's...they offer olive oil but the butter is where it's at.  We were greeted promptly by our server who suggested a great wine for us. We ordered calamari as our appetizer. Calamari isn't my favorite because it's usually so overcooked and chewy that it's just not worth the money. Giordano's used panko breading and these calamari were fried perfectly. The accompanying marinara sauce was fantastic as well. Not too sweet and not too tangy.  One of my party ordered the chicken and the other veal marsala. I ordered the Giordano's chicken which was chicken parmesan but with a slice of eggplant onto of the chicken before it was breaded. It was fabulous. The veal was fork tender and very flavorful. The chicken marsala was not over-cooked like some tend to be and each of us had an accompanying side of vegetables and our choice of penne or spaghetti. We all chose penne and it was perfectly cooked. The vegetables were al-dente and had been tossed in a buttery sauce. They weren't dripping in the sauce, but rather, the sauce was just kissing the veggies. It was quite heavenly.   For dessert we shared a tiramisu and cheesecake. I am usually not a fan of tiramisu because the ones I've experienced had such a strong coffee flavor that it was off-putting. Not so at Giordano's. This was tiramisu with a background flavor of coffee like it's supposed to be. The cheesecake was rich, creamy, and probably the very best i've ever had, and I've had NY cheesecake in some of the finest NY restaurants.   Our server was friendly and non-intrusive. The busboys were equally non-intrusive and kept to themselves. It was a bustling place and while these servers and bus people were busy, they never made you feel like you were bothering them.  I highly recommend Girodano Trattoria Romana in Carefree. It is pricy, but you have to expect that given the location and the local clientle.  I am trying to figure out a way to make an excuse to drive up there REAL SOON! :)

Very impressed. The service was excellent, the food was delicious, and the atmosphere was fun yet elegant.   My husband treated me for a pre-birthday dinner while visiting Vegas this past weekend and he picked Postrio. I like Wolfgang Puck though sometimes he's a bit overrated. Postrio however, did not disappoint.   I had a lovely glass of prosecco and we enjoyed the trio of housemade sausages for an appetizer. My husband had the spaghetti and meatballs and I enjoyed the meatloaf. We were both impressed with the bread selection and thought the foccocia was the most delicious we'd ever tasted. For dessert we shared the Banoffee which was a banana cream pie with toffee sauce. It was amazing!   Definitely ask for a table inside if you don't want the hustle and bustle of the Venetian to intrude on your dining experience. It's much quieter inside and more appropriate for an intimate dinner for two.

We were fortunate to stay here via my husband's Diamond VIP hotel points so perhaps we got treated a little better than the average guest, but our stay was really very nice.   The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. The breakfast was excellent. The service was very polite and helpful.   It's about 1/2 mile from the monorail which is nice.  If you are looking for an off-the-strip getaway, this hotel is just right.

Great service, amazing food, beautiful view...what more could you ask for? Well honestly, I'd ask to not be packed in like sardines and a somewhat less noisy environment considering the pricey-ness of restaurant.   I loved that there is a dress code in this restaurant. I loved the menu choices. I thought the service was outstanding. I loved the view from our window seats as we watched the fountain show at the Bellagio below and enjoyed the Vegas strip. The food was perfection. The chocolate souffle was absolutely to die for! With all of this perfection going on, I truly feel silly even mentioning the negatives, but for me, the experience really has to be impeccable to give that 5 star rating. We were packed in so tight that my husband and I almost had to look at each other sideways to enjoy each other's company. And because we are packed in like sardines, the noise level is far more than what it should be for a more upscale type of place.   That having been said, I can't wait to go back and see if perhaps I can give it a 5 star rating next time!

My wonderful husband treated me to a spa day for my birthday and I was thrilled with the package that he selected for me.  I started the day with a Coconut Cream Body Scrub and massage. Quinn performed my scrub and massage and it was wonderful. I prefer to have a male masseuse as women tend to overcompensate and rub too hard. Quinn did a great job and worked out all the knots in my back. Ahhh.  Next, I had a Custom Concept facial. I hate that I can't remember the woman's name who performed this service, but she had an amazing Russian accent. My pores have never been so squeaky clean and the face and scalp massage was wonderful.  After having been scrubbed, massaged, and polished, I headed down to the salon for a pedicure. I had the Paradise Pedicure and it was very nice. My toes look perfect and Jessica did a great job smoothing out all my rough edges. :)   I received a full grand tour of the spa and did also use the gym which had a wide variety of machines and free weights. Everything was in good working order and I was very pleased with the service and the spa treatment. I would definitely go back!

Wow.   For quite a long time I've avoided Pizzeria Bianco. I didn't want to be disappointed by all the hype. I'm a New Yorker. Pizza is like family. Don't f-with family.   So why did I finally break down and go to Pizzeria Bianco? I had to see for myself. I had to know. I had to understand why this place is rumored to be the best pizza in Arizona--and quite possibly, the best pizza in 'Merica. We were going to a Suns game that night and thought...why not?   And is it the best you ask? Does it live up to the hype? Is it worth the long waits?   Definitely. Most definitely. Absolutely. Unequivocally. Undeniably. Yes. I have had MANY a slice of pizza in my 4 decades of life and the pizza at Pizzeria Bianco is unmatched in Arizona.   Despite the rumors of long waits, our party of 4 was able to slide right in at 5:30PM on a Wednesday night with no wait at all. Valet parking at Heritage Square made it nice. The restaurant was busy and before we left, that's when the wait was just beginning. We were greeted promptly and received drinks right away. We settled in and enjoyed this smaller size brick building and checked out the crowd. It was a little drafty on the cooler December evening but the number of people in the restaurant made it comfortable.  Within 15 minutes, we had two fresh, hot, straight from the brick oven pizzas on our table. We enjoyed the Bianco Verde pizza and the WiseGuy which is a sausage and caramelized onion pizza. Big deal--sausage pizza. No..seriously. This is sausage from Shriners sausage factory here in PHX. Like the best sausages in town. And they didn't disappoint. Both pizzas were incredible tasting though my meat lovers both said that they thought the BiancoVerde was superb.   It must have been the Gods smiling down on us that we were able to just get right in with no wait and I'm not sure when I will tempt fate again, but seriously...this is the best pizza I've had in Arizona. Hands down. No joke. Believe the hype.

A great baseball park! I've been to many stadiums across this great land of ours and Chase Field is one of the best. There is not a bad seat in the house. I have yet to find a single person who works here to be unfriendly or impolite--whether it's the beer guy, the hotdog vendor, the ticket taker, the ushers, it doesn't matter. Everybody who works here is polite, friendly, and courteous. I've been coming here since it was Bank One Ballpark and I have always had a good experience.   The one downside to Chase Field is that the food is EXPENSIVE. Expect to shell out a small fortune for food.   The other downside is that they allow Dodger and Giants fans to come to the stadium. Most of those Dodger fans are obnoxious, rude, and ridiculous. And the Giants fans are whiny babies. But that's not Chase Field's fault. ;)

Went with a party of 10 this past weekend for my best friend's birthday extravaganza. We had teppanyaki and our chef was terrific. He was very funny, inviting, and did a great job with everyone's food. We had a range of dishes from seafood to chicken to very well done steak and our chef handled it all with his silly little giggle.   The happy hour prices can't be beat, but man once you get out of happy hour, the drink prices are STEEP! We had drinks, appetizers, sushi, and then teppanyaki. The calamari was chewy, but the bbq chicken egg rolls are great.  The drinks were yummy. I have no idea what kind of sushi we had, but it was pretty darn tasty too.   The only reason this isn't a five star review is that our server had the personality of a rock. If he cracked a smile, it might have killed him. We spent collectively close to $500 and I don't think he could have cared any less about us. Too bad too because it reflected in his tip and generally we are pretty generous tippers.   We'll go back to Sapporo in a heartbeat though. The people watching is tremendous!

Dear Bobby, I have been a very long-time fan of yours and I have long anticipated eating at one of your restaurants. I was thrilled to get the chance to eat at your place in Caesar's Palace. While I enjoyed very much the cactus pear margarita and the goat cheese queso fundido, I was very disappointed by our server as well as the quality of the Mesa Burger my husband and I shared.  Let me start with our server. If his presentation style was anymore negative about what WASN'T available on the menu that afternoon, we might have left had we not really wanted to try your food and been as hungry as we were. It's one thing to be out of something but it was the WAY he said it. "Just so you know and don't get your heart set on it, we are OUT of the ribs. They aren't that good anyway" was how it was presented. Hmmm. Not good. He then described the Tuna "Nachos" as being more Tuna tar-tar with a side of tortilla chips and said "unless you like raw tuna, this isn't for you". Um...ok. You get the point. This guy clearly needed some training. And I won't throw him under the bus and name him here but email me if you want to know more. As for the burger. I'll go back to our server....we ordered the burger to share and ordered it medium well. He repeated it back to us, medium well and confirmed we wanted to split the order. When the burger arrived, it was all on one plate. I figured he didn't tell the expediter or just didn't note it on the order. We wait a couple minutes and he finally appears with 2 plates and a knife for us to split the burger ourselves. Um...ok. I cut into the burger and it is rare. Ok, rare is an understatement. It was raw. Blood raw. Definitely NOT medium well like we ordered and he confirmed. So we had to flag down a waiter as ours had conveniently disappeared. He came back and said that we had told him medium rare. Um...no we didn't. We never eat anything rare and he had repeated back to us what we wanted which is why I knew he knew what we ordered and just wanted to put it on us. So a new burger came a few minutes later and while that wasn't medium well either, it was a lot better than the raw that we got initially. Unfortunately, your chefs feel the need to ridiculously overseason the burgers to the point where you can hardly taste the burger itself. And the fries? Ugh. An over-seasoned, over fried mess. There was a coating on the fries that totally took away from the potato flavor of the fries.  Quite honestly, this first visit to one of your restaurants was a huge disappointment. I expect more from someone of your caliber and while you didn't cook any of this yourself, this was a representation of your brand. I don't know if that is fair or not, but I guess if you are going to put yourself in the position of being on a pedestal by being on television, you need to hold those who are running your brand to a higher standard. If this is what your restaurants are putting out, I think that you need to spend less time at Food Network and MORE time in your restaurants.  Please read my review on Holsteins and visit their restaurant to see how to really get things done.  Thanks for reading this and I hope you will take it to heart....even though I figure you'll probably never see this and those who really should see it won't really do anything about it. Good luck...

Talk about a perfect experience...Delmonico is just amazing. My husband and I enjoyed the best meal. He enjoyed the petite wedge salad while I had the lobster bisque. He had the NY Strip and I had the bone-in ribeye. Our server told us that these would be the best steaks we've ever had on the strip. At first we thought he was just blowing smoke, but boy, was he ever right. The steaks were perfectly seasoned. We shared the au gratin potatoes which were hearty yet creamy and just delicious.   The service was perfect. Not intrusive or annoying at all. Food arrived at the proper temperatures and my drink was never less than 1/2 full.   Can't wait to go back. Thank you Emeril!

I don't think I could have found a more perfect place to celebrate my birthday!   After an amazing experience in December, I was so pleased to hear we would be going back for my birthday! I decided that this time around I would try out something besides steak. I knew they had steak down pat, but if this were truly an Emeril place, I knew I had to check out the other menu selections. So this time around we enjoyed the artisanal cheeses to start and I had the shrimp with fettuccini with olive oil. My husband enjoyed a trio of filet mignon medallions. The pasta was perfectly cooked, not overly dressed in sauce with the shrimp cooked to exactly the right temperature.  My husband's filets were also perfectly done and the sauces that adorned the medalions were amazing. Truly amazing. We shared the potatoes au gratin and of course, these were just as heavenly as I remembered from our first visit.   For dessert, we shared the chocolate root beer float. The root beer was Abita, made in Louisiana. It was mild in flavor yet refreshingly delicious. I could swear that the chocolate ice cream was house made though I don't know that for a fact. It was sooooo refreshing and just the right way to top off our meal.  I love Delmonico. It is by far my favorite restaurant in Vegas. I can't wait to go back. One day I hope to meet Emeril and hug him for making such wonderful food.

I never was a "Cirque du Soleil" kind of person. I watched a few specials on TV and found them boring and just...well.....weird. After seeing KA, I can honestly say that I am a fan. The show was spectacular in every sense of the word. The action is breath-taking. The stunts were impressive beyond my wildest dreams. The story was interesting and holds your attention. There is so much going on that really, it's hard to take it all in and I must have said WOW about a thousand times after the show ended. I truly had a hard time wrapping my brain around what I had just seen. The stage revolves not just around in a circle but actually stands end on end.   You just need to see it to believe it. And I think if you keep an open mind, you too will be as impressed as I was.

2 words--not impressed.   I called ahead to see if we could make a reservation for our party of 3 as we had show tickets and was informed that they do not take reservations for parties smaller than 8. I was assured however that we should have NO PROBLEM being seated promptly at 6PM on a Saturday evening. Our show was at 8PM so I figured a 2 hour window should have been ample. It's just pizza--how hard can it be? Boy was I wrong.  Well guess what? The restaurant was P.A.C.K.E.D. We waited 20 minutes to be seated which wasn't too bad for a Saturday evening at a popular spot but when the expectation was already set that it "wouldn't be a problem" to get seated, it was annoying.  The hostesses were friendly and pleasant tho so it was hard to be outwardly annoyed.   We were finally seated inside and proceeded to wait some more for a server to come by and take our drink order. 10 minutes passed when I flagged down a busser to ask if we could get someone to take our drink order. A few short minutes later, our server arrived and so it began...the glare. The "can't you see I'm very busy and you'll just have to wait" glare. Sigh. Because we were seated in a smaller room, it was very noisy and our server REFUSED to speak louder to share with us the beers they had available. We aren't deaf...it was just loud. She wouldn't move closer to the person asking, she wouldn't speak louder, nothing. And then she walked away...and 10 minutes later, she passed by to inform us that the bartender was backed up and it would be a few more minutes but didn't stop long enough to take our appetizer or dinner order. Fortunately, the busser was VERY on top of keeping our water filled so at least we had SOMETHING to drink. Drinks finally came out and we had to ask her to take our appetizer order. Again the "can't you see I'm busy" glare. It was 30 minutes after seating that our appetizer finally came. We ordered the Burrata which is fresh mozzarella with proscuitto and toast. Although the mozzarella and proscuitto were delicious, the toast was burnt...visibly burnt. I'm not even sure why she put it in front of us that's how burnt it was. But, we couldn't send it back because no one ever came by to check on us.   More time passes and everyone in the room has received their appetizers, entrees, and have moved on to dessert except for us. We are still waiting for our entrees and are watching the clock. At 7:20, I flagged down our server who gave me the glare again to ask her if our pizzas were coming out soon as we had show tickets. Instead of "I'm so sorry for the wait, let me check on that for you" I received the "I'd call you a bitch if I wouldn't get fired for it" glare and this time the glare was accompanied by a lecture that there was a party in the Carriage House. I had NO idea what the Carriage House was or why a party there had any effect on our meals but our server had already huffed off before I could ask. So we googled. Turns out Carriage House is part of Cibo where they serve large parties. Good to know...would have been better to know back when we were getting seated about these delays but so be it. Our pizzas arrived at the table at 7:30 PM. We have now been at Cibo for 90 minutes. Our show was at Comerica and was starting at 8PM. We scarfed down that pizza as fast as we could and Ms. Glare left us the check at least when she dropped our pizzas.   After all that waiting, rudeness, and more waiting, honestly? I've had better pizza at Picazzos. This pizza was thin looking but was doughy. The sausage on the Salsiccia was sparse at best. The Rustica wasn't cut properly so we were fighting with the proscuttio. Both were just ok. It was really very anti-climatic.   Cibo was a major disappointment. Considering all the rave reviews here on Yelp, I am that much more disappointed that our experience was so dismal. I wish I could tell you our server's name. If she said it, we sure didn't hear her and I'm pretty sure she didn't say it. There are lots of other options downtown. You might consider not going to Cibo unless you go with a larger party because apparently that's the only way to get good service and properly prepared food.

Hubby and I had date night here recently and we had an EXCELLENT experience. We decided to try someplace new as some of our old places were getting a bit old hat. Bobby's was classy, the staff was VERY friendly, and the food was DELISH! I think the only thing I would change is calling it a Jazz Lounge because there wasn't one note of jazz that played during our time there, but if that's the worst thing...so be it.  My husband and I shared the hummus appetizer. The crackers were interesting, but the veggies were fresh, crisp and perfect with the hummus. I had the chicken and fusilli and it was excellent. It wasn't overly saucy and was plentiful with chicken. I believe my husband had steak but honestly, I was so focused on my dish...it was amazing. I know he enjoyed whatever it was he had but for the life of me, I can't remember. We did enjoy the raspberry mousse for dessert which was creamy and just heavenly.   Our server was wonderful...friendly, kind, and gave perfect service. He was truly very nice and made our visit one that was quite memorable.  I'm looking forward to coming back for a future date night!

Pinball Hall of Fame? Not typically my cup of tea but my friends are HUGE fans so I sucked it up and tagged along. Much like casinos where there are no clocks and no few windows, PHOF is just as dark and timeless. We ended up spending 3.5 hours there and it felt like no time had passed at all! What a fun afternoon! The variety of games from old school arcade style to old school pinball to brand new pinball games was really impressive--even to someone who isn't in to video/pinball like me. It's pretty cheap to play with machines varying from .25 up to $2 depending on what you play.  There is no snack bar but there are a few snack machines and soda machines for you to get snacks if you are so inclined. And part of the building is dedicated to rebuilding/remodeling some of the machines so it's pretty...rustic....but that aside, it's got a nice layout and the widest variety of pinball games and old style arcade games that you will be entertained no matter what your skill level is.    So, if you are looking for something fun to do, head over to PHOF--but here's a tip--DO NOT take a cab over. The cabs will give you a very hard time about coming back to get you. The bus stop is nearby or take your own car...but be prepared to have an old-school fun time.

Very nice hotel just off the strip by the Convention center. Clean, modern, and smoke-free makes this place a nice break from the hotels on the strip. The pool is nice, the restaurants are good, and the staff is friendly. The catering manager, Michael, is OUTSTANDING. Our rooms were just the right size. Beds were comfy and because of our Marriott status, we enjoyed ice cream AND beer as our welcome treat. Gotta love it! :) Looking forward to coming back!

I've been coming to the Red Door for a while now and it only recently occurred to me that I should "yelp" them. Shame on me but certainly not a reflection of the spa itself.  I go to the Red Door mostly for salon services but the spa services here are outstanding. My review though is going to be solely about the salon.   If you are in need of a good hairstylist, I have one word for you. It's the only word you need to know and will ever need again. Gaston.   Who is Gaston? Gaston is only the most spectacular magician of hair that has ever walked the earth. Forget Fredric Fekkai. Forget Jose Eber. Ken Paves who? Louis Licari has NOTHING on Gaston.  Gaston works hair miracles all while providing service that is beyond compare. He gives great advice on color and style even taking the time to teach you how to do your hair so that you too can look just like you walked out of the salon every day.   Gaston is a diamond in the rough and I can't sing his praises enough despite the fact that I have reservations about sharing him with the world. I want to keep him to myself....but someone with a gift like Gaston shouldn't be kept in the dark.   I will warn you...services at the Red Door are kind of pricey but haven't you lived with that mousey Super-Cuts hair-do for long enough?   Call the Red Door at the WigWam today and ask for Gaston. Seriously. Now. Your grays will thank you and you can thank me later. ;)                     Why haven't you called Gaston yet?

Although I enjoyed my experience at the stadium--it was clean, food was good, service was great--what I REALLY enjoyed was the bus ride over from Kellis to the stadium. This was so well run, well thought out, and well executed. I appreciated that they didn't let anyone on the bus who didn't have the NFL approved bags or were in any way likely not going to make it thru security at the stadium. It was my first time but I did read up on the requirements so this didn't directly affect us, but I could easily see how this could have been a very aggravating experience for first timers and I appreciated the security's professionalism and thoroughness.

I really don't get what the big deal is about with this place. I went after reading all the rave reviews by other Yelpers last evening before heading to Gammage to see Wicked. For the first time, I went to a Yelp-recommended place and was very disappointed.   First of all, the place is a dump. It's run down and kind of dirty...or at least gives off a dirty feel.I have seen the new Pasty that is over on Guadalupe in Mesa and the decor is very nice and it's clean.  This location is not wheelchair friendly at all and don't bother bringing more than 4 people unless you plan to stand at the bar.   I'm not sure if they were employees or just friends of the employees who were working there but there was a group of college age guys hanging around both behind the counter pouring their own drinks and lounging in front of the counter who were just filthy. They had dirty beards, dirty hair, dirty ripped up clothes....I had no idea that the new look in college guys was homeless-chic.    The food was....eh. My son had the meat and cheese pasty and I had the rueben. We shared our pasties and I was no more impressed with the meat and cheese than I was with the rueben. They weren't bad...they were just eh at best. You get the pasty...no side dish, no salad, no nothing. It's not really a value.   Our server was pleasant but nothing special. She served our food and kept our cokes filled. It was clear that the focus was on the bar. There were about 9 people just hanging out at the bar, which is fine, but the place isn't advertised as a bar. I had brought my 8 year old son and this place is really not kid friendly given the amount of attention given to the bar and the dirty patrons/employees who were hanging around.   If I do go back to Cornish Pasty it will likely be at the newer location which is why I give it 2 stars and not 1 because as a chain, it might be worth the 2nd visit. This one is just not worth the drive from the West Valley.

I have dined at WCG before and attempted to make plans for my group of friends and I to celebrate a birthday there.   Unfortunately, WCG does not accomodate parties greater than 4. You will have to wait until tables become available as they will not even take a reservation for anything greater than party of 4. No, this isn't advertised on their website. Seriously...and in this economy? Really?  Keep this in mind as you all are preparing for your holiday celebrations and go somewhere where your business is appreciated.  I sent them a copy of the receipt from our party of 9's  dinner elsewhere to the corporate offices to let them know what they missed out on. I doubt they will care as Jillian, the hostess who answered the phone when I called about our reservation was completely unfettered  to lose our business. Absurd.

Enjoyed lunch here with my husband while visiting Vegas this past weekend. My husband enjoyed the burger while I enjoyed the apple salad. Service was pleasant, professional, and right on time. The food was delicious. The burger was very tasty with fries that were so crisp they practically snapped! My salad was fresh and perfectly dressed. I hate when a salad is over dressed. I did get chicken breast to go with my salad and it was a bit overseasoned to the point of being too salty.   All in all, this was a fun restaurant and a good dining experience but just remember, you're paying casino floor prices..so don't get sticker shock when the bill arrives.

I am such a fan of Dooby's Grill. It is a fantastic little hideaway off of Dobson Rd in Mesa. We drive 45 minutes out of our way to eat there and are thankful that the price of gas has decreased enough to make it worth our while to go more frequently.  First of all, Dooby's is NOT Greek food. It is Israeli food with some Mediterranean stylings added in so for those of you who consider yourselves fans of Greek fare, keep this in mind when you come to Dooby's.   The atmosphere at Dooby's is very Middle Eastern-casual. There are standard tables, but also tables with pillows on the floor as well. If you plan to eat a lot, eat at a standard table, because there is nothing more humbling than trying to roll yourself into a standing position after gorging on warm pitas, lamb kebabs, and baba ghannouj. Don't count on this being a quick meal either. Food comes out of the kitchen at a steady pace, but if you are intending to have a quickie lunch, it's better to phone your order ahead.   The lentil soup is fantastic. Very flavorful and the texture is perfect. The hummus is wonderful as well. Get the hummus deluxe as it has diced pieces of lamb in it. Yum! And the hummus has body to it. It's not some paste smeared on a plate. My meal of choice is always the Chicken Schwarma. You can have it as either a meal or a sandwich but it doesn't matter which way you have it; it melts in your mouth. The garlic sauce is a nice addition to the schwarma, but you don't necessarily need it as the schwarma has great flavor. Every once in a while, I like to add some shug to my schwarma for a little kick. For those that don't know, shug is a Yemeni hot sauce made with cilantro and jalapeno peppers. My hubby and son enjoy the chicken schnitzel. We have enjoyed pretty much everything on the menu.  One area where Dooby's could improve is in the salad department. The salads are unexciting at most. But then, most people don't go to Dooby's for the salad anyway. And it's the 2nd reason why I enjoy the lentil soup. Also, and maybe it's a personal preference, but I find the falafel lacking as well. They remind me of dense, flavorless hockey pucks. I generally skip them because I am used to more crisp, flatter, less dense falafel. Perhaps I've become a falafel snob? But I digress....  The service staff at Dooby's is very casual and friendly. Dooby himself is in the kitchen cooking and I can't remember a time when he's not there. There is also belly dancing as well which personally, I can take it or leave it, but my male companions seem to enjoy it for whatever reason. But because of the belly dancing, it's not necessarily the most kid friendly place. Kids are a bit uncomfortable with the whole half-naked lady gyrating around the dining room thing.   Oh and one last thing, you have to ask for the check at Dooby's. They don't just bring it to you. It's a European thing and something I rather enjoy because you never feel like you are being rushed out of the restaurant.  Go to Dooby's and see for yourself. Don't take my word for it.

I am a huge Suns fan but my review is about the fundraising options that the Suns have to offer as well as their back-office staff.  First and foremost, talk about a professional, classy organization. Whether you have fundraising experience or are a total novice, the staff treats you like you are the only group they are working with. My contact is Kyle Pottinger and he is always a gentleman. No matter what questions I have, he always answers them promptly and never makes me feel like I'm bothering him.   The fundraising process is easy and the tickets practically sell themselves because who doesn't want the chance to purchase discounted tickets?   The process is easy and the rewards can be lucrative depending on the target audience you are working with. The Suns will treat you professionally and courteously. You won't be disappointed.

We have been going to The Landmark for years though now that we live over an hour away, it's been several years since our last visit. But, suffice it to say, despite the lengthy amount of time between visits, The Landmark did not disappoint!   The restaurant is just that...a Landmark. It is the original site of the first Mormon church in Mesa back in 1908 and it's also where the original Mesa Community College was located. It's very antique-y looking and is rich with history with loads of photos and information all throughout the restaurant to share the historical details of not just the restaurant but this particular section of Mesa. It's in an older part of Mesa so naturally it attracts an older crowd. Those reviewers who complained about the ambiance and the crowd clearly didn't get it as to where they were dining.   I've eaten here off and on for about 15 years. I have never, ever had a bad meal at The Landmark. The food is always hot, well seasoned, and delicious. The Salad Room is unique and interesting with lots of choices for just about any palate. For our entrees, my son enjoyed the NY Strip which was well seasoned and had a bleu cheese sauce on it, loaded mashed potatoes, honey glazed carrots and even onion rings! The men in my family like their steaks well done and this was perfectly done without being over-done like so many places can do with a well-done steak. We also had the champagne chicken which melted in my mouth. It was amazing. We were delighted to see that they still serve sorbet between the salad and main meal to cleanse the palate. I so love that. It's a touch of class that seems to be lost in many of today's restaurants. We also enjoyed dessert of chocolate mousse and the 3 cheesecake sampler. Everything is made on site and there is clearly TLC in every dish. The menu has a wide variety of choices from seafood to grilled entrees, to things like stuffed meatloaf and stuffed pork chops. Again, we have never, ever had a bad meal at The Landmark.  The service is impeccable. For me, it's the gold-standard for restaurant service.  Every other restaurant I have ever reviewed both here and prior to Yelp has had it's service scrutinized via the baseline that is The Landmark.  The service is always friendly, never intrusive, yet extremely attentive. We have never had a server who was snarky, rude, or unhappy to work there. We never have had to remind a server to bring something or had to wait for refills. The service is perfect. Don't change a thing!  We are definitely going to make a point not to allow such a lengthy amount of time to pass before we hit up The Landmark for a meal. Please give this place a chance as I'm sure you won't be disappointed.

First timer and man did we have a good time! We were a walk-in party of 10 and we were quickly and easily accomodated. Our server was one of the owners and she was very helpful with our choices as well as providing quick service with piping hot food.   Our group sampled a wide variety of dishes including combo appetizer, the ma tar bah, the thai fried wontons, Chicken Pad Thai, Spicy Thai Wrap with chicken and shrimp, the BBQ chicken, Gai Ping, Grilled Pork with Spicy Pineapple, and Crispy Chicken in Spicy Thai sauce. Every last dish was excellent and served hot.   Can't wait to go back again...even if it is an hour away from my house!

What a fun way to see a movie! We enjoyed the Jambalaya and Mac and Cheese with our showing of Zoolander 2 and it was a good time. The food is fine...nothing overly special but it is a fun and different way to see a movie. It was nice to be served rather than wait like sheep at the candy counter. It was nice to have someone else cook and clean up. While it's a bit pricey, it's a creative treat for a fun evening.

I can't believe I'm doing this...it's BEST BUY for God's sake. It is, as a rule, the most unpleasant customer service wasteland that I've ever experienced and I detest and avoid the store like the plague.....until yesterday.   You see, I had to go buy a new remote for my TV...and they carry this particular model at Best Buy and not at my preferred stores. So I very very begrudgingly went to my Surprise Best Buy store...where in the past, I've experienced non-existent customer service, a discombobulated store where you can't find ANYTHING because nothing is where it should be or makes sense to be, and the cashiers are about as dull as a kid's set of plastic knives. Yesterday I was in the twilight zone. The security guard at the door greeted me. I thought he was talking to someone else until he made a point to look right AT ME when he said hello! (I KNOW, RIGHT??) And then when I went to the TV section to find the remotes...I was GREETED by not one but 2 employees! (SHUT THE FRONT DOOR!) And these two employees were PLEASANT to my children (hang on--It gets weirder!) They took me right over to the remotes, showed me where the one I needed was, explained a little about it to me to make sure it's what I really needed, and didn't pressure me into buying ANYTHING I didn't need. I looked at my older son and pinched him to make sure we weren't dreaming....and he was just as surprised as I was by this whole thing. As we crossed the store to the cashier, I was greeted by 3 more employees who were in various departments. As we approached the cashier, I was sure that this was going to be SS.DD (that's same SH!T different day for the novice) but the girl greeted the 3 of us, made eye contact, and even though she has to try to sell me the warranty, she didn't push when I said no thank you. She was pleasant, genuine, and I felt like she cared about me as a customer.  I am still kind of floored by the whole experience and while I can't believe I'm saying it, I would actually CONSIDER going back to my Surprise Best Buy store without first having to psyche myself up or take a shot in preparation for the visit. And that makes me feel so weird.....but I guess anything is possible!

Always busy which is a good sign that they do a good job at this store considering there are 3 others within a 3 mile radius. Store is always clean, staff is attentive and friendly, and fast. I don't have to repeat myself 50 times with what to put on my sandwiches either which is something I do appreciate.   All in all a nice place to stop by for lunch on the go!

Mediocre food with unfriendly service. Restaurant was dirty. Tables were left unbussed and one of the workers decided that fixing the door in the middle of the lunch rush with a drill for 30 minutes was a good idea.  First time...and last time.

I make a point to come to Sprouts every week to buy produce and I can't believe it never dawned on me to Yelp them before. My bad....  The store is super clean, the staff is very helpful and nice, and the produce is the freshest and last longer than any other store in the area. The meat counter is excellent, the deli is wonderful. Prices are reasonable and a great selection!   The only drawback to this store is something that isn't even their fault--this store is a big attraction for snowbirds. This makes shopping during snowbird season frustrating at best but again, this isn't Sprouts' fault though I wish they did something to appreciate their loyal RESIDENT customers when the snowbirds go home who had to endure the rudeness of the snowbirds.    But hit up Sprouts for a great grocery experience! :)

Unimpressed. It's very pretty and has an interesting menu to read but for the prices charged, I was very disappointed in the lack of FLAVOR in the dishes. The only thing that was even remotely interesting was the salsa served with the chips. As an Arizonan, it's by default that we eat a lot of Mexican food. I've had way better. It's too high priced for the lack of flavor.

I am sorry that I didn't try this place sooner. It's divey, dark, and cheesy in decor but the food was excellent and plentiful with great service.   While there was nothing there I hadn't had before, it was really the service that stood out--though the food is very very good. Our server, Julie, was great--kept our drinks full, delightfully, and even got to know the kids at our table to call them by name to help them feel special.   I had the chicken and asparagus special. It was terrific. My son had the moo shi house special which he loved. I wish they would have put the plum sauce on prior to rolling, but they brought a squeeze bottle filled with it to add as much as you like. We enjoyed the sweet and sour chicken, kung pao chicken, and beef and broccoli as well. All were very good. The egg rolls are exceptional.   We look forward to going back soon!

Unfortunately, the family who owned the restaurant for more than 30 years decided to sell and get out of the business. This restaurant was part of my family for the majority of those 30 years and there was no better pizza in Phoenix. You can keep Pizzaria Bianco. He's got nothing on Sal. There was a family feeling...and when you were a regular, you felt like part of that family. We had many a family dinner at this restaurant and to know that Sal, Vonda and the boys are no longer there is like losing a part of your own family.   We gave the new owners a fair chance. The new owners clearly don't know how to make pizza and either didn't buy Sal's recipes or just haven't bothered to learn the technique. We ordered 4 pizzas and each one of them had a different degree of doneness. My husband described the sandwich in his review below....and when we asked why the sandwich had to be heated when it's supposed to be a COLD CUT sandwich, we couldn't get a satisfactory answer.   If the Restifo's are out there....we miss you and wish you would buy back the place. It's not Paesano's without you.

We had a very enjoyable visit recently! Food was very flavorful but I'm kind of a fan of hot food being served hot. Everything was the same temperature. The service was EXCELLENT which is what really bumped up this rating.   We tried a variety of dishes from teriyaki chicken, cactus rolls, the shrimp california roll, and the Arizona tiger roll. We also had gyoza, and the combination tempura.   All in all, this is a great little place and I am really looking forward to going back soon! Just hope they watch their serving temps.

We have gone to this Friday's several times. It's adequate. The food is decent. The atmosphere is fun. The Irish Car Bombs are excellent. :) The service can be hit or miss, but apparently the managers are reading these Yelps cuz the service has gotten considerably better.   What makes this restaurant stand out for us is Kara. The last couple times we've come to Fridays, we were served by Kara. She is a FANTASTIC server. She is friendly, professional, and gets our orders right no matter how many in our party. She doesn't forget things or make you feel like you are bothering her. She is GLAD to have you as a guest. I realize that might be what a server is SUPPOSED to do, but you guys know as well as I do that's not always the case, especially with chains.   Just like with any chain, your service can be hit or miss, but give this Friday's a chance and you might just be surprised at the improvement.

Hands down the worst restaurant in Surprise.   The only reason we came here tonight was to support a fundraiser for our school's PTA. TGI Fridays promises a 20% return for everyone who turns in a flyer to their server. That would be great if people weren't leaving left and right prior to being served! I personally watched 4 tables of our families get up and walk out after waiting at least 15-20 minutes just to have their order taken after being seated. That is simply outrageous and unacceptable.   The same girl who forgot about seating us back in November tried to INSIST that my 8 month old baby sit in a booster seat because they can't put the high chairs out in the aisles. I told her I needed a high chair and to sit us at a table. She kept trying to seat us in a booth and told me again about the whole high chair in the aisle policy. I told her I don't care what your policy is, my 8 month old needs a high chair.....so we got seated at a table and she told me again no high chairs in the aisles. I don't know if she is just dense or what but given that she still has a job there after the crap job she did back in November leads me to believe she must have naked pictures of somebody to still be working there....or they just don't give a damn. Silently, I pushed a chair to her and took the high chair from her and seated the baby in it pulling it next to me so it was out of the aisle. She goes "ohhhhh...that's smart.". O-M-G.....  I hung in there because it was for the school, but honestly, we should have left as well because we waited 15 minutes for our drink order to be taken after the saga with just being seated. Drinks came and we placed our order. We ordered the Chicken Quesadillas to start, lobster ravioli for my son and a club sandwich with a side salad for me. The side salad came out first which puzzled me and concerned me that the waitress forgot our appetizer. I said nothing though and about 10 minutes later, the quesadilla came out. It was overdone and had that burned taste to it though it wasn't burned in coloring. I think the quesadilla maker probably burned the quesadilla before they made mine and I got to taste the remnants. It was overly saucy to try to mask the burned flavor...though it wasn't a very good job. :( The side salad was 1/2 cup of lettuce with a couple of grape tomatoes and 4 croutons. My son said the lobster ravioli was not very good and it tasted more like imitation crab meat to me when he gave me a taste. It also didn't come with the bread stick that was advertised in the listing. *sigh* It's for the school though so we hung in there....and waited 25 minutes for our check. Literally. We watched people waiting to have drink orders taken, waiting for their checks, waiting for their food...and mostly a whole lot of waiting.  It wasn't just our server who was slow...the entire restaurant seemed to be in a time warp! It was un-freaking-believable. I asked to see the manager, and quite honestly, I'd still be waiting for him because he never came by my table. Waitress finally came back and said, "You don't want dessert, do you?" Wow......but we ordered dessert to go just so we could get the hell out of there and up our bill for the school's benefit. It was the very first time I've ever gotten a to-go cup of ice cream with the dessert but I digress.   I doubt our school did very well in this fundraiser due to the horrendous service that everyone experienced. It was the hardest earned 20% I've ever given. Next time I'll just make a donation to the school rather than go through that disaster of a dinner again. This TGI-Friday's should be ashamed of themselves. They taut that they do these fundraisers right on their tables but they are no where near equipped or capable of benefiting these non-profits and schools. Shameful!

Believe it or not, our school actually made about $50 for our fundraiser and this store STILL HASN'T PAID OUT! Their manager gave us two expired certificates for a free meal to use as a raffle and now won't return our calls. ABSOLUTELY THE WORST!

Never did pay us the money they owed us for our fundraiser and karma finally caught up with them. This location is CLOSED PERMANENTLY! good riddance to poor customer service and sub-par food.

My husband added me on to his membership for my birthday and so far, I like it. It's a gym without the meatmarket feel. I like that I can go anytime I want. The equipment is great. Lots of variety, always in good, clean, WORKING condition. There is no babysitting available so you definitely have to plan ahead to use the facility. Also, absolutely no one under 16 is allowed on the gym floor at all so don't plan on having your tweens or younger teens coming along with you to use the equipment. They claim to offer classes though I've not had the chance to experience them because the times don't work with my schedule at all and I'm not sure what the variety is on the classes as no one else seems to know when I ask, but so far, I'd say that this is worthy of 3.5 to 4 stars. :)

Freshest tasting coffee and coffee drinks that I have ever had.  The store is funky and fun, They offer cool new, specialty flavors on a regular basis. The staff is super friendly, and I have never been disappointed in visiting this little gem.  My son says they have the best iced Chai Tea latte that he's ever had and after tasting it--I would agree! Can't wait to go back!

Looking for a good dentist? Legacy Dental Group is your place! Dr. Louis Core is very professional, knowledgeable, and downright friendly. The office staff is polite and professional. Dr. Core has been my dentist for years now and I drive a good distance to go see him.   But the real reason I go to Legacy has nothing to do with Dr. Core and EVERYTHING to do with Nancy, my hygenist.  I have never had a moment of pain or discomfort while in Nancy's care. She can do a cleaning so fast you won't believe it...and it's a GREAT cleaning.  She's hilariously funny and she never makes you feel bad if you aren't the best flosser in the world.   Legacy's office is also very kid friendly. Dr. Core has a bushel of kids himself so he understands how important it is to make kids comfortable, especially at the dentist. And Nancy is great with kids too. Took my son today and he actually said he LIKES going to the dentist!   Go see Dr. Core and Nancy. You won't regret it.

Who LOVES locally owned, family run businesses? And who toots their horn loudly when it's warranted? THIS GIRL! And El Ranchero in Wickenburg is about as good as it gets. Sure the decor is rustic and a tiny bit tacky, but what GOOD, AUTHENTIC Mexican place doesn't have these qualities? What will make you come back is the food. And oh how I enjoyed the food.....  Our group of 8 was seated promptly and greeted very warmly by the owners as though we were old friends. The chips and salsa were excellent; and not just because it was chips and salsa but because there were two different heat levels as well as a fantastic bean dip that were just waiting for a warm, perfectly sized chip.   We enjoyed chimichangas, enchiladas, street tacos, and even taco salad ranging from beef to pork to chicken and every single thing we had was DELICIOUS. My baby had a cheese crisp that was about as awesome of a cheese crisp as I've ever tried. And it was ONLY a cheese crisp for goodness sake! It was really THAT good. Another great thing is that if you are trying to watch the added calories that refried beans can add to your plate, they will substitute black beans for you instead!   Our drinks were kept full, our plates were served hot and fresh, our entire crew was treated like family. I.cannot.wait.to.go.back.to.El.Ranchero. SOON!

Went back again the other night with just my husband and baby boy. We had just as good of a time as we did with our group a few weeks before! I had the shrimp ceviche tostada special. It was A.M.A.Z.I.N.G! Fresh avocado slices on top of freshly made ceviche. Yum. The tostada didn't even get soggy while I fussed over little man getting him to eat his cheese crisp--which was excellent again as usual.   Husband had the red chili pork special and it was so tender and delicious.   The service is so friendly and polite that you can't help but feel right at home.  Love it!

Each year for the past 5 years, my son and I have made it a holiday tradition to come to Symphony Hall and see the Nutcracker. This review is based on the Nutcracker presentations solely.  The show itself has been up and down over the years. This year, we agreed that the evening show on 12/11 was the best one yet. The dancers were light on their feet with very few mistakes.   The only thing that needs to change is the price and quality of concessions. I'm sorry but if I want Safeway cookies, I'll go get Safeway cookies. If I'm going to pay $3 for a cookie...it better not be a Lofthouse cookie.   All in all, it's been a great time over the past 5 years sharing the Nutcracker with my son and making Christmas memories. I'm looking forward to going back.

I preface this by saying that I am not really a video game person. At least not to the extent that my husband and son are. That having been said, I had a total blast at D&B. There is something there for everyone, in every skill level. A big group of us went to have some fun for my hubby's birthday. Love the prize options to purchase with your game tickets. Love that the games are pretty generous in giving out tickets---or I'm better than I think I am at video games.   I had a great time and I'm looking forward to going back.

Where to begin? Our organization held its annual convention here and while the price was certainly right, we quickly learned that you definitely get what you pay for--and not in a good way.   The banquet manager is a nice enough guy but man talk about nickel-and-diming people to death! They tried to charge us .25 per pen if we wanted pens for our workshop rooms. They would charge us for water by the gallon and one of the staff very rudely informed me that if I wanted a cup of hot water for tea for my sore throat that I would have to buy the water by the gallon!   The rooms were all way too hot with the A/C not working properly. Even the restaurant azul was HOT like bikram yoga class hot. The hotel overall had a musty smell to it and the pool was not well maintained.  The convention center was a perfect spot to hold our exhibit hall but the City owns the convention hall and they are ridiculous with what they want to charge for as well.   I'm not sure if it's a Mesa thing or if this is just a restaurant beyond the norm for Marriotts because this was the rudest, most bizarre experience I've ever had.

Red, white and bleu salad was super yum and a great addition to the menu! This location was clean with great service and food served at just the right temps! Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos! When I'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I'll hit up again!

The basic rule of thumb for us gringos when it comes to getting authentic, delicious, cheap Mexican food is to go to Mexican restaurants that actually have Mexicans eating in them. Lupita's is one such restaurant.  Make no mistake, Lupita's is a dive. A complete and total dive. And what can you expect for a restaurant based in El Mirage? It's not exactly the gastronomic capital of the world and Lupita's doesn't disappoint.  The furniture is mismatched and the sombreros that are hanging on the wall are definitely cheesy.  Even the Christmas lights that are hung up are hap-hazard at best.  However, there are no better Carne Asadas, Green Chili Burros, or dare I suggest it...the Gringo's delight....tacos...in the Valley!   A kids' menu is available with the usual kid-type fair and the adult menu has a broad spectrum of delicious offerings sure to please the most discernable palate.   On Friday nights, there is a live Mariachi band from 6:30-9:30PM and Mondays-Thursdays, margaritas are only $1.99 from 3-7PM. And those margaritas are quite yummy!  The service staff is friendly, relaxed, and treat everyone like regulars and there are A LOT of regulars. Guests can sit wherever they like and there is always a game of some sort on the televisions. And dependings on the evening, you can find Lupe herself cooking in the kitchen.   Take out service is available and they are more than capable of handling orders large and small in short order.  Oh, did I mention the fresh, housemade salsa? Yeah...that's a definite must have as well. The chips are fresh and hot...not hot from under a heat lamp, hot from being just take out of the fryer.   Again, make no mistake, this place is a total dive, but you will not regret for a second going to Lupitas' for your dose of Mexican food delights.

Don't let the long lines discourage you from coming to Chipotle. The staff works fast and the food is plentiful and served at the right temperature. The staff is also nice and you don't have to repeat yourself when placing your order.   On this particular day, I had chicken tacos. They were absolutely yum. Everything is made to your specifications so if something isn't right, it's probably your fault! :) My husband loves the burritos. Now while the girl making his over did it with the salsa, it was still pretty darn yum...and why was it yum? Because it was made the way he likes it. :)   The one thing I like a lot at Chipotle is the guacamole. It is so flavorful and I love chunky guacamole. They do it just right here at Chipotle.

Save your money and go to Paradise Bakery in the food court. Same quality of food for 1/2 the price.  I had the turkey cranberry sandwich and the chicken soup. The sandwich was actually quite bland and the soup wasn't much better. For nearly $20 for a soup and sandwich, I was expecting some wow.  Just cuz it's Nordies doesn't mean it's quality.

The only downfall to Sweet Tomatoes in general is the price. It shouldn't cost me more than $20 for 2 plus drinks. At Sweet Tomatoes, it's at least $25. That's kind of annoying because....IT'S JUST SALAD! But--that having been said, the salad is fresh, the soups are flavorful, and the other hot food items are plentiful. The staff is friendly and polite. It's always a good visit but the sticker shock can be a little surprising because IT'S JUST A SALAD BAR.

This store is less than 5 years old and looks like it's over 20. Run down and in complete disarray with staff who are seriously unhappy being here makes this store even worse. Our visit today found the store in such disarray that I thought a small tornado had run through it.  Even my 2 year old said Mommy this store is a mess!  For a 2 year old to notice is saying a lot.   I try to shop local because our city could use the sales tax but from now on,  I'll drive over to Surprise. This store is....well...a dump. And that's the nicest word I can find for it.

I don't typically give chains a 5 star review but we had an OUTSTANDING experience at this BJ's last weekend and here we are a week later and I'm still very pleased! We had a group of 12 people and from the time of reservation to the time we got our check we received 5 Star treatment all the way!   The food was good, the service was EXCELLENT, and the overall experience was top notch! We will definitely be back!

My dad likes this place and requested to go here for his Father's Day lunch. For various reasons, we ended up not going until yesterday...a Friday afternoon...and it was not a good scene.   First of all, there was no one up front manning the counter so we had to wait...and wait...and wait for someone to come seat us. The restaurant was not busy but for some reason waiting seemed to be the theme of the day. When we were finally seated, we ordered drinks which took an excessively long period of time to get. Then we had to wait some more for our server took our order. She only came over after I went over to another server to ask for some help. Had I not been with my Dad, I would have left. He seemed OK with the waiting but it was 40 minutes before our order was taken...and again, it was NOT busy.  That's just unacceptable. It was another 30 minutes after we ordered for our food to come. So it was well over an hour from the time we sat down to the time our food came and we didn't order anything complicated....a couple of hot sandwiches! And when our food finally did come...it was COLD! I was SO annoyed. I mentioned it to the cashier and he just said oh I'm sorry to hear that. Ugh.  Last time we ever go here again. There are a million places to go for a meal. Skip Black Bear Diner on Bell. It's not worth the hassle.

I've avoided it as long as I can, but I did go back to the Black Bear Diner as it's still my Dad's favorite place for breakfast. You know what? I'm glad I went. It was actually a pleasant experience and for the most part, the place has vastly improved from my last visit.   First of all, they offer fit fare selections on the menu which is important to me. The portion of egg whites I had was way more than advertised, but that's ok because it was a vegetarian omelet that was filled with veggies that I don't ordinarily find in an omelet: squash, zucchini, and more! I asked if I could skip the toast and just have fruit and the server gave me a double portion of fruit! Nice!   Dad had the french toast and he loved it. It's a generous portion of french toast and more than he could finish.   And the server was really very nice. She smiled and kept smiling the whole time she served us! Yeah...I know, right? Crazy! She was pleasant, friendly, and prompt with service. Loved it.   I might actually suggest we go back again the next time I meet Dad for breakfast!

This is generally a good place to go for a nice ladies type lunch. They have lady-fare with sandwiches, soups, and salads. Men get dragged here from time to time, but when you go in, it's mostly the ladies who are here cackling like hens in the hen house. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. My favorite is the chicken walnut salad sandwich. I get it on a croissant rather than the dark grain bread.   This visit though, I came for breakfast. I've had their bagels and muffins but this time I ordered a vegetarian omelet. This came with fresh fruit, toast, and I ordered orange juice. The juice was fresh squeezed and it was delish. The fresh fruit was nice as well. The omelet...not so much.   It was a good sized omelet with a squeeze of sour cream on it and some feta inside. It appeared well made with the right fold to it. I cut in and that's when the disappointment began.  When you order a vegetarian omelet...you expect veggies. This omelet had diced tomatoes and broccoli. That's it. Now I know that Paradise Bakery has more veggies than just that so I was moderately disappointed about that. Yes broccoli and tomatoes are veggies (well tomatoes are a fruit, but I digress) but if you call something a vegetarian omelet, PUT MORE THAN 2 VEGETABLES IN IT!   What made me put out though was the fact that the broccoli was raw. It wasn't even remotely cooked and it was only slightly warmed by being wrapped up in egg which means that the broccoli was tossed on top of the egg which was then folded over to make the omelet shape. This means that the diced tomatoes were also raw as well. Not good.  So, I bring this to the attention of one of the service people who is nearby cleaning tables. They seem confused by what the problem is. I'm trying to explain about cross contamination, etc but it's clearly not part of the vocabulary of this person. So then I speak to the manager.  He at first argues with me that the broccoli is just al-dente. Now, I am a trained chef. I know the difference between al-dente and raw.  How he could even make that claim was beyond me because you could tell by looking at the broccoli that it was raw. I make him taste it. It's then he agrees that it was raw. We discuss cross contamination, safe food handling...He then just says well that's how we do it here. I see this conversation is going no where. I set my fork down, thank him for his time and tell him I am not interested in eating this omelet any longer. He offers not a refund, not a new omelet, nothing.   I like PB for their sandwiches and soups but now that I know how they handle food at breakfast, I'm probably not going to go back there for lunch. They are an massive diarrhea episode waiting to happen and I don't have time in my life to risk that chance. So based on the raw food and the manager's inability to satisfy a customer, 1 star. And that's generous.

I've been to Thailand and I can say that this is about as authentic as it gets on this side of the world.  The staff were warm and friendly.  What I loved most was that I could choose the level of spiciness in my food. It was a great treat to get to do that.  The prices are reasonable, the food is flavorful, and the service is excellent. This was well worth the trip to Anthem from Surprise.

Good visit! Friendly staff and consistently good pizza. Very clean restaurant--even the bathroom was spotless which was nice. Our server forgot about us after she dropped off our pizzas but it was still a nice visit. Try the beet and goat cheese salad. This one was pretty yum! And the California Veggie pizza ROCKED!

Yum. Just Yum.  Ok I have to give you more than yum...I know. :) But let's start with YUM.  I have ordered from this company for several years now and the brownies never disappoint. Each brownie is individually packaged for freshness and they are the most moist, flavorful brownies I've had outside of my own kitchen. (And I make damn good brownies--but they don't travel well. LOL)  The thing I like best is that they offer sugar free treats too so even my diabetic friends can still enjoy these delicious brownies without worrying about their sugar skyrocketing.   My favorite is the chocolate chip brownie but I'm also partial to the white chocolate and hell, even the original Plain Jane is really delicious too.   Fairytale Brownies ships all over the country to share some this holiday season with those you love most too!

Came in from PHX to give Shabu Shabu Paradise a try based on the recommendation of a local friend.   In a word....fantastic. The food was delish and the service was wonderful. It takes some time to get your food after you order because everything is cut fresh that day so be prepared to wait a bit. However, it is SO worth the wait! We had both Shabu-Shabu and sukiyaki and omg...yum.  The dipping sauces were good accompaniments and overall I can't say enough great things about this place!  The service was attentive, kind, and very helpful as for some of us, it was our first time.   Can't wait to go back on my next trip to Vegas! :)

Breath-taking! This is the best word I have to describe Love.   This was my second Cirque du Soleil show with Ka being my first. Where Ka left me with that WTF-just-happened-feel (in the best possible way), Love told a subdued story about Love set to the music of the Beatles. The costumes were wonderful. The performers were ridiculously talented, and the music...well...you can't ever go wrong with the Beatles. I left this show feeling invigorated, positive, and full of, hmmm, LOVE!   I would absolutely go back if only to try to catch all the stuff I missed because there is always so much going on during a Cirque du Soleil show. Truly visually amazing.

First visit we ended up leaving because what was supposed to be a 10 minute wait turned into a 30 minute wait and we had a show to get to....but I'm SO glad we went back another time.  Food portions are HUGE so don't be shy about sharing a meal or even just an appetizer cuz DAH-YUM you get a lot of food. Love the drinks in mason jars too. Now that's the right way to drink sweet tea!  And the food was excellent. In fact, the biscuits and apple butter could easily be dessert...or a meal on their own. WOW. Super yum!   Our server Bethany was terrific. She kept our drinks full, was very personable, and had great suggestions without being intrusive. I will definitely be back--and am looking forward to those biscuits and apple butter very soon!

The best way I can describe our visit with Margaritaville is genuine. Everyone, from the hostesses to our server to even the stiltwalker guy, were very genuinely happy to have us there, genuinely happy to be working there, and the food was genuinely great!  We came last night with the 10yr old to celebrate his first week of school and we had a great visit! Hubby and I shared the Cheeseburger in Paradise and it was AWESOME. The fries were crisp and well seasoned. The burger was perfectly cooked and delicious. Son had the fish tacos and they were amazing. The side dishes were even well thought out and delicious. I had a side salad with our meal and it was cold, fresh, crisp and not some pre-packaged slop on a plate. We also had a slice of cheesecake and a slice of key lime pie for dessert. Food was EXCELLENT.  I had the wildberry margarita and it was AWESOME. My hubby had a rum and coke and said it was perfectly balanced.   Our server, Jimmy, was polite, friendly, and very professional. Our drinks were never empty and he was never intrusive. Our food was served at the right temps and never seemed to have sat around under heat lamps. I hate when that happens.   The stiltwalking balloon guy was just super. He was friendly, kind, and genuinely glad to have us visit his place. In fact, we remarked that he looked just like the Jolly Mon from Jimmy Buffett's childrens book of the same name and he thought that was awesome. :) He made the most amazing Spiderman balloon creature that we've ever seen.   Son has been raving about this visit for the last 12 hours and made a point to tell me to be sure to YELP this place as soon as possible.  it's not often that I can say that I look forward to my next visit at a restaurant, but I am truly and genuinely looking forward to our next visit to Margaritaville.

Another great visit to Margaritaville last night! We went with a party of 7 and sat out on the patio. Fortunately, we got there before the Coyotes game got out because the place was a ZOO after the game let out but that didn't stop our server, Jason, for continuing to provide us with EXCELLENT service. Our drinks were kept full, our food was delivered hot, and he was friendly and fun.  Several of us enjoyed the Cheeseburger in Paradise, while one friend had the Seafood Mac and Cheese which was delish. Another friend shared the fish tacos which are super fresh and perfectly grilled. We all shared the Volcano Nachos which are HUGE. I don't know if they are $15.00 worth of huge, but they were big, hot, fresh, and yummy.  We had the Chocolate Hurricane which was by far the best dessert there and I've tried them all. (and no I'm not ashamed of that either. :P ) We had a great time and are looking forward to our next visit back!

I love love love Which Wich. We enjoy sandwiches here often when we go to Westgate and so happy that it continues to do well. The staff is fun and friendly. The process of ordering your sandwich is unique and interesting. The sandwiches though...oh my. They are so yum. The bread is fresh, chewy on the inside, crunchy on the outside. The deli meats are cut when you order the sandwiches and the condiments are just perfect! Whether you get it cold or toasted, you can't go wrong at Which Wich. And try the "house" chips. They are seasoned perfectly! :)

Abundance of trails for a variety of skill levels. The per vehicle charge is $6 and they only take cash so be sure to bring $ with you. The park's house are reasonable and the staff is great! Have been out here many times to hike, take guided tours with the rangers, and more. Its a fun, cheap, and a great way to wear out the kids in a beautiful setting.

Stopped in recently after a fun night at Brush Bar and was very glad that we did! Pizza is delicious! The husband/wife team who own this place are pleasant and really from Italy. Wife is a little rough around the edges but I suspect it's from all the drunks who stop in there late in the evening and give her a hard time. We found her friendly and nice when we chatted about her Italian heritage. Sometimes you just have to make it about others and not about YOU. ;)  The restaurant itself is a little older and rough around the edges compared to other places in Old Town but in a way, it was refreshing to get something GENUINE instead of contrived like so many places there are. It's got a handful of tables and a high tops along the window but it's clearly meant more for take out than dine in.   The pizza was very yum. I had a slice of pepperoni and jalape√±o which was excellent. My husband had a slice of Italian sausage and a slice of pepperoni. Both were great. The sausage wasn't too spicy and the cheese was excellent. We even got a pie to go to thank our babysitter (the big son) for a job well done. The pie to go was even tastier than the slices we had.   We will definitely go back to Best of Italy next time we have a pizza craving while visiting Scottsdale. It's worth the visit and I look forward to exploring more of the menu.

While we live within walking distance of Ultra Star, I am more than happy to drive the 8 miles out of my way to come to this theater. It's always bright, always clean, and the staff of able-teenagers is always polite. I do like my teenage employee peeps to be polite and make eye contact with the customers and Harkins does seem to train these kids right!  I love the discounts offered at the snack bar for frequent movie goers. I love that the theaters are clean after every showing. I love that the seats are comfortable and the sound is just right.   While Harkins can't be held accountable for the few idiots that venture out to go to the movies and have to provide their own subtext to the movie going experience, Harkins is responsible for every other part of my experience and I have yet to be disappointed when I go to this theater.

Reasonable prices, good service, over-priced snacks (like every other theater) and comfy seats! I do enjoy this AMC very much though when I have to come here versus the Harkins on Northern.  The one MAJOR drawback and this is a BIG WARNING is that if you go on the day of a Cardinals home game, EVERYONE and I do mean EVERYONE has to pay $10 to park in the parking lots at Westgate. The parking attendants will give you a ticket to take inside and AMC has a person there to give you back the $10 but the fact that you have to pay it to begin with sucks. What if I didn't have cash on me? This by no means is AMC's fault. I suspect it's the City of Glendale's or the Cardinal's convoluted way to soak people but at least you do get the money back if you are paying attention.

It's more than just a library, it's a community hub that brings together every age group and walk of life to expose us to culture, activities, and education all under one roof!   The location is within bike riding distance from my home so my son meets his tutor there weekly in their bright, open workstations. My 2.5 year old and I have attended the Toddler Story Time and Toddler Songercize classes which are fun, friendly, and best of all--FREE! I have attended classes here on a range of topics and of course the library itself is fantastic. Such an enormous selection of books, movies, and so many pc's that there is simply no excuse not to come visit the library. What I like best though is the ability to download eBooks to my iPad from their website! I don't have to remember to return the books because after 14 days, the book isn't available to me anymore...and I just have to check it out again. No late fees, no guilt. Gotta love it!

I am an enormous baseball fan. I have been to all of the Spring Training facilities here in AZ and Surprise Stadium is one of the nicest of the bunch. I took in a game recently with my 8 year old and his buddy.  Parking is free which is a nice gesture and the tickets are reasonably priced, but as I've thought about it more, I think this is why the price for concessions is so ridiculously high.  $5 for cotton candy during Spring Training? Seriously?    The field itself is absolutely beautiful. The seating is well done and the grass area is also well manicured and well maintained.   The volunteers they have acting as ushers could be a little more diligent though. There was a kid who thought he could stand in the aisle talking to his buddy for as long as the rest of us would let him and not once did the usher come and remind him to take his seat. Fortunately, the kid had his name on his baseball glove that he was clutching so when I called his name and told him to SIT DOWN, he sat...mostly because he was scared that this strange lady knew his name! His mother didn't like it much but I reminded her that if I wanted to watch a game with a kid standing right in front of me the whole time, I'd go watch at home on TV. That got a chuckle from my fellow seatmates...and the kid kept his butt in the chair the rest of the time. :) This is not the first time I've experienced less than diligent ushers at this stadium and for this and the very expensive concessions, Surprise Stadium only gets 4 stars.

I've been to this Babbo on several occasions and the service has stunk each time. The food is decent enough but not so much that I'm willing to deal with the indifferent service. I've been here 4 times with various friends and family members and each time we've suffered through indifferent, half-assed service. I'm just not willing to put up with it. I'll wait the hour it takes for me to be seated at Olive Garden at least I'm treated like I matter there. (Dare I say...like family? haha)  The final straw for me with this restaurant was that they were going to donate lunch to a class at my son's school and nearly welched on the promise. Apparently the school had to get real pissy with them to get them to fulfill their promise and it was only then that they came through.   Sorry, but you don't welch on promises, especially when there are kids involved. A donation of spaghetti, sauce, and salad isn't going to kill a restaurant.

My usual Mediterranean/Greek place was closed tonight (hopefully not forever...) so friends and I gave this little place a shot.   First of all, the place was packed, which is always a good sign. It's small so there isn't a great deal of seating, but they do offer outdoor dining which was nice.  We ordered a sampler platter of stuffed grape leaves, spanikopita, hummus, and baba ganoush and it was all wonderful. The hummus was creamy and very flavorful. The spanikopita dough was flaky and light. The baby ganoush was perfection.  My hubby had the falafel platter and we were pleasantly pleased with the fact that the falafels weren't little hockey pucks. :)  One friend and I both had the chicken swarma. He had it as a gyro, and I had it as a platter. Both delish.   Other friend had the chicken souvlaki and greek salad. Loved it!  The service was prompt and friendly and we can't wait to go back again soon! Well worth the drive from El Mirage. :)

A fun visit to Pitta Souvli! Had the chicken schwarma which is good but just not the same as Doobie's. But since Doobie's closed, this will have to do. My son had the falafel platter which was good, but the trouble with falafel is that if they are over done, they are hockey-puck-like in texture. Our companion had the special which was a mediterranean burrito. It was awesome.   We live in El Mirage so it's over an hour drive for us to get to Pitta Souvli but it is worth it.

I've been to this Changs a bazillion times over the years. The food is always the same consistency but the service has been up and down over the years. I went yesterday with my group of girl friends for GNO and we had a blast. Our server, Memo (yes, that's his name) was excellent. He kept our drinks filled, handled all our quirky lady-crazy orders, and was friendly, upbeat, and helpful. The food is the same typical Changs food that you can get anywhere but the difference is the service. I hope that this Changs keeps up the good work because everyone needs a good go-to place. :)

Wow what a great experience we had at Kabuki last night! Joe was our server and he was wonderful. He gave great recommendations to us first-timers and even had fun with our littlest guy!   Oldest son had dragon roll and the eel was so fresh tasting with just the right amount of sauce. A very generous portion with 8 slices so it had enough for a meal or enough to share if you wanted!  Husband had the  beef teriyaki which was a very generous portion served with soup, salad, and rice. I had the chicken sukiyaki which was HUGE. I didn't necessarily care for the texture of the cellophane noodles but the rest of the soup was delicious. My littlest boy had the roku which was basically beef teriyaki over ramen noodles with a salad. It was really very good.  I also had the calpico soda which I'd not had before. It was made with milk, soda water, and peach kiwi juice. It was terrific!   Our experience at Kabuki would not have been better and I can't wait to go again very soon!

We love Chef Eddie Matney and we are so glad he got away from Stoudemire's downtown. That was a waste of his talent.   The food here rocks. I had a steak that was off of their nightly special menu that was out of this world. The husband had the meatloaf. How can you not love that meatloaf?   The service was stellar. The dining room was stellar. Mark Curtis walked right by our table and said hey to us like we were old friends.   Can't wait to go back!

Another great visit to Eddie's House! It was quiet last night as it was New Year's Day and I suspect that people were too hung over to dine out, but that didn't deter Eddie or his staff. The service was excellent and the food was spot on as always.  Eddie is also on Facebook and Twitter so if you are a friend of his, you can get a heads up on some awesome deals! For example, over the Christmas holiday, he offered 50% off on his gift certificates. So if you buy a $50 gift certificate, you only pay $25 for it. Awesome idea and let me buy several for friends while keeping one for myself. :)   You can't go wrong at Eddie's House so don't be afraid to give it a try. It's very affordable for a Scottsdale joint and well worth the price of gas to get there!

What can I say that hasn't already been said about Eddie's House? Eddie is not just an amazing chef but he and Jennifer are tremendous hosts. When you eat here, you truly are eating with family.   I took my son for a Valentine's Day treat and we had a great time. The restaurant was packed, as expected for this type of holiday. The Valentine's Menu did not disappoint. We were in a surf and turf mood so we shared the Twin Heart Filets of Beef and the Maine Lobster. The filets were actually in a heart shape and were not just adorable to look at but DELISH! The lobster was perfectly cooked and so succulently sweet. Perfection on a plate and there is nothing in the world better than freshly caught lobster. For dessert, my son enjoyed the chocolate dipped strawberries and I had the Oreo Fudge chocolate cake. Both were treated to a generous dollop of housemade whipped cream and both were amazing.   As always, the service was impeccable.  The hot food came out hot and the cold food came out cold, just as it should be, and right on time despite the packed house. I was expecting long kitchen waits, but the kitchen staff was really doing an awesome job keeping up with the orders.     We save Eddie's House for special occasions, but the prices are such that you could eat here weekly and not break the bank. And we are always welcomed like old friends and we always have the best time! Thank you Eddie, Jennifer and the Eddie's House Family! You did not disappoint and we can't wait to come back!  And an aside to the woman sitting next to us who gave me a "Scottsdale" look and eye roll for bringing a 10 year old...at least my date behaved better than you....sloppy sloppy. ;)

What a gorgeous, professional looking facility! With 24 regular courts and a spectacular center court, it is really a nice showpiece in Surprise. We've been taking lessons for a few weeks now and our teacher is EXCELLENT. Can't say enough nice things about the facility and its staff.

My 6 best girl-friends and I decided to give Vogue Bistro a try after hearing a rave review from a family member. We eagerly arrived on a Friday evening and found the house was packed! We did have a reservation and were seated promptly outside on the patio. Walking through the restaurant showed us a lovely sophisticated dining room with just the right volume of music. The restaurant was brimming with patrons.   And then there's the patio.....  Vogue Bistro is located at the far end of a strip mall and it backs up to a residential neighborhood. I suppose that explains the cats who were milling around outside on the patio looking for scraps of anything delectable that might come their way. I am hoping that it wasn't a sign that perhaps there were rodents in the area as well, but given that there is so much seafood on the menu, I am hopeful that this is what drew the cats to the patio. Not that we minded the feline visitors....but it's just not something you typically expect.   The patio is ok. They do have heaters in case it is a cool evening, but, overall, the dining experience is a bit lacking if you have to dine on the patio...if not for the cats but for the lack of ambiance.   The cuisine at Vogue is refreshingly upscale without the upscale price. The chef is pleasant and friendly and works her ass off in the kitchen. There are so many chefs in the Valley who don't actually cook anymore, rather they stand in the kitchen yelling. Oh wait..and they are usually men. hahaha. We enjoyed the flat bread as well as a recommended appetizer of the day which was slow to arrive, but worth the wait.  My dining companions enjoyed a variety of dishes from the skewers to the meatloaf to the delicious hamburgers. Again, the meals were very slow to arrive, but once they did, they were delicious.   Our server was pleasant, but seemed put out by our large table. This did reflect on her tip overall, I regret to say since our bill was well over $100.   One surprise at Vogue was the treat of the most delicious margarita that we've ever tasted. The agave nectar was house made and I truly think that was the key.   Overall, I would say that Vogue Bistro is a very nice change in the typical chain restaurant laden experiences you find in Surprise, but be prepared to be there for a while. This is an experience you want to savor.

The first word that comes to mind about my recent experience at Vogue Bistro is "DISAPPOINTED". From start to finish, our visit was simply that, disappointing. I knew things had changed there when we waited to be greeted at the hostess stand and a server came up to greet the woman in front of us. He kept trying to seat her when all she was doing was picking up a to-go order that she had already been helped with. He finally got snippy with her when he caught on that she wasn't needing his help. I don't know why he wasn't catching on...she said it loud and clear about how she was picking up a to-go order and didnt need help. So that was the kick-off to our evening.   Now in all fairness, our server was pleasant enough. She was thorough, polite, and competent. The food though was quite disappointing. The fritto misto was a hot mess. Well in this case, a cold mess. Although we were seated on the patio, you would think that in those first few seconds of being on the table, the food would be hot...not the case. It was a big, discombobulated pile of cold, fried mess. The calamari was terrible. It was chewy, overdone, and mixed in so much into the other fried items that you couldn't tell what you were eating most of the time. Every thing tasted exactly the same...flavorless.  My friend and I ordered salads and my son ordered the Vogue Steak. I ordered the Vogue Salad. Most of the time when you get a frisee salad, frisee is a featured green. In this salad it is THE green. The dressing was minimal at best and the chicken was flavorless. Very disappointing. My son ordered his steak medium and one part of the onglet was rare and the other part was well done. And there was a RIDICULOUS amount of shoestring fries. It was a serving enough for 6 people. And the food took FOREVER to come out! We watched the servers waiting anxiously for the kitchen to get the orders out and could see by the body language that they were uncomfortably antsy.   So all in all, I paid $97 for meh. That was for the Fritto Mess, Steak Vogue, 2 salads and 2 glasses of wine. And that chaps my hide. But I will tell you...there are better restaurants in Surprise that put out better food at far less of a dent in your wallet that will treat you like a valued guest. Go there. You will be far more satisfied than with my experience at Vogue.

I've been to Ultra Star a number of times and have been underwhelmed each visit. The one plus to this theater is that it's within walking distance of my house. It's not my favorite theater but we've kept going back from time to time simply due to its location--not because we like it.   For a newer theater, it's kind of dumpy. The lobby is too small and crammed with stuff for functionality. The carpet looks old and trampled and kind of old-school versus the competitor theaters. Bathrooms are just kind of bleh and most of the time, not terribly clean.   If you go to the first show of the day, expect that the theater will not open until 15 minutes before said showing starts. Sure, it's $5.50 for the first show, but the staff is so freaking slow, you've missed all the previews and often times, at least the first 5 minutes of the movie too!  Concessions are RIDICULOUSLY overpriced. This chain is a California-based chain and they charge California prices for their concessions. They offer no frequent movie-goer discounts or bonuses at all. And again, the staff is SO FREAKING SLOW for really no good reason.  At least the popcorn is fresh tasting.   Ultra Star is also pretty darn stingy with what it will donate to local non profits as well which for me is a downer.   All in all, I don't see this place open in another 5 years. The theater is never packed and again, with California prices but located in Surprise bordering El Mirage...I just don't see it surviving much longer. And when I have the choice, I drive to the competitors 90% of the time.

Stopped in for lunch today with my boy after catching Harry Potter at the movies. This is the first time we dined in since my last visit back in February though we've enjoyed take-out a number of times....pregnant lady cravings dignify only the best when it comes to pizza needs. :)  My son and I were greeted warmly by the hostess and immediately sat at our table. Within minutes we were greeted by our server and her trainee and got our drinks promptly. LOVE THIS! It's as it should be. I know that it seems silly to point it out but so many places can't seem to do these basic things right!   We shared a 16inch meatball and pepperoni pizza which was baked to perfection. The meatball slices were thicker than usual and this made the pizza that much more flavorful. Additionally, I think they changed the pepperoni as it wasn't as spicy as it has been in the past. This is ok with me as I thought the pepperoni was a bit overpowering before.   Our server and her trainee were not intrusive or annoying at all like we've experienced in the past. In fact, they thought it was hilarious that we had told the hostess we didn't need menus because we knew EXACTLY what we wanted. They were both friendly, kept our drinks full, and didn't try to participate in our conversation or interject themselves into our lives beyond providing us with great service. Such a relief from times past when the servers have been way too involved in our table's business.   We ordered dessert to go and enjoyed a slice of blueberry cobbler cheesecake after coming home. It was DELICIOUS. It was a double decker slice of cheesecake with blueberry filling in the middle and a crumble topping on top. It was really excellent.  Very happy that they've toned things down and did some real training of the service staff at Grimaldi's. I'm not ready to give them the 5 stars yet, but they've definitely improved.  We will be sure to dine in again soon!

Honestly? I'm just done with this Grimaldi's. The service absolutely SUCKS and last night's effort was definitely a perfect example of what's wrong with this location.  We had a 1 hour wait last evening, which was excessive given there were tables that were empty waiting to be filled for quite some time. Secondly, we ordered 2 salads but only received 1 of them. We waited so long for the other, the pizza came out first so we cancelled the other salad. No apology. No offer of making it up to us...nothing. There were at least 1/2 a dozen times when a server or a guest broke a dish or glass while we were there. It was almost to the point where people should have started shouting OPAH! afterwards! At one point during our meal, a child raised a plate over his head, smashed a plate to the floor (to which the parents did NOTHING--but that's another story) right in front of the server. The plate broke in a thousand pieces, several of which hit us in the legs. It took at least 15 minutes before someone came and swept up the remnants of the broken plate. That is unacceptable but......Did the manager come over? Heck no. He didn't even MOVE or turn around from his seat at the bar where he was parked watching the Spurs/Heat game. That's right. The manager parked his butt in a seat at the bar the entire time. He would randomly get up and go cut a pizza from time to time, without washing his hands first mind you, but he never came around to a single table, never looked up once during the parade of broken dishes, and could not have been any less involved in his shift. The pizza took so long to arrive that it was actually cold and the crust was soggy.   Done. There's just no reason for this when Grimaldi's isn't a cheap visit at all. I've given too many chances and it's just not worth it.

Impeccable service, delicious food, and beautiful ambiance. What more could you ask for?   What I enjoyed best was that we brought our kids and were still treated like royalty. My children are perfectly behaved and I've received compliments everywhere I go because my kids are so good you hardly know they are there. That doesn't keep some nicer restaurants from making you feel like lepers. In fact, the reason we went is to celebrate my 11 year old's Honor Roll achievement and from the waiter to even the manager, the staff made a point to come by and congratulate him on his hard work.  The food was wonderful. Although my steak was a little short of medium, the Flemings potatoes always make up for that. And the chocolate lava cake at the end? OMG. But my favorite is the chantilly whipped cream. I could eat a bowl of that all by itself.   So I'm looking forward to going back to this Flemings and I really do appreciate how kind they were to my son on his academic achievement. They didn't have to gush so much, but they were genuine and very sweet.

I've been to Kokopelli a couple of times now and I've held off writing a review because they are kinda new. I feel now at this stage of the game, they are due for their review.  Each time I've gone to Kokopelli, I've gone with a group of at least 8 people. The first time was for my husband's birthday. I made a reservation for my group, but we didn't get seated for more than 30 minutes after our arrival time and our reservation time had gone by. It wasn't until I complained and said we were going to walk did a table for 8 suddenly open up. This last time when we went, we were seated promptly and our table was ready and waiting for us.   The service at Kokopelli is very laid back. When I say laid back, I mean in the "just a sec, hon" kind of way. First off, I'm not your hon, sweetie, darling, or any other condescending monicker that rolls off the tongue of someone who isn't really up to the task. It irks me to no end when I am called this by a server and it seriously drastically takes away from your tip.  So, when our server walked by and made eye contact with me while our party of 9 was being seated, I got the "be right there, hon" and I knew it was gonna be a wild ride.  Said server came back a few minutes later and took everyone's drink orders, promptly calling each person in our party, sweetie or hon. *insert eye roll here*.  When she returned, she had forgotten one of our party's drinks so she had to go back for it. She then took our salad and appetizer orders again to a barrage of sweetie and hons. When the apps and salads came out, she had forgotten our Crab and Artichoke dip. When I asked her about it, she got the "oh yeah!" look and went to check it out immediately.   I should note in this part that it's not actually crab in the Crab and Artichoke dip, but Krab. This was disappointing but we were hungry so we dealt. The dip itself was blah. I imagine it's supposed to be served hot, but ours was luke warm at best. It was just eh.   The kitchen staff the past couple of visits has appeared sparce to me. And when I say sparce, I mean I only see 2 guys working the kitchen...and that on a busy evening service isn't necessarily a good thing. On both visits to Kokopelli, it has taken more than 20 minutes from the time we were FINISHED with our apps to the time we receive our dinner. This particular time, we didn't get our dinner until 30 minutes after we had FINISHED our apps and salads. This to me is very slow service. For this, I blame the kitchen, but I have to wonder if it's possible that the server doesn't tell the kitchen to fire the dinners until she sees we are done. Either way, it's way too long to sit there waititng for dinner to arrive. I don't expect it dropped in front of me as I take my last bite of app, but within 10 minutes seems reasonable...not 30.  So, yet again, said server didn't bring a couple of items that my companions had ordered so she had to go back for them. This was getting annoying, but we barreled forward. I had ordered the Pasta Danielle with Crab....er I mean KRAB and Shrimp. This was supposed to have a creole sauce in it but it was more like alfredo with a few red pepper flakes. It wasn't even a red sauce! Sorry. That's not creole. But by this time, I was hungry and ain't no way was I sending this one back for fear that we would never see it again. My hubby had the fish and chips which he loves. The chips are sweet potato fries which are delish. 3 of my guests had the ribeye cooked to varying degrees. One companion ordered it with bleu cheese and apparently it was the bleu cheese that made the dish because the others said it was just blah at best. In fact, they ordered a side of bleu cheese just to make the steak go down a little easier. Another companion had the pasta cordon bleu which she enjoyed but there wasn't any chicken in it. Apparently you had to order the chicken separately which she didn't realize. I couldn't see what the others had but they seemed to enjoy it.   We all also ordered dessert. We had the apple crisp, pecan pie, and bread pudding. Of course server AND kitchen forgot one of the bread puddings so when it was finally brought out to our companion, most of us were finished. On top of that, when he took his bite, it was SO HOT that he burned his mouth. Nice. Thanks for over-nuking the dessert. He didn't bother to finish it but decided to take it home.  I have to wonder if the service is better with smaller parties, but honestly, I don't think I'm going to go back to find out. It's hard to expect an establishment to treat it's parties of 2 any better than it's parties of 9 because it's all in the skill of the service staff. The wine is nice at kokopelli so buy a bottle and enjoy at home. At least you'll be free from the sweetie and hon saga.

My son and I went last night to District before heading to see the Nutcracker. The restaurant is sprawling and very modern in decor. Our server, William, was very knowledgeable, friendly, and uber professional. (Are we still using uber? If not, you get what I mean...)   We enjoyed the calamari as a starter and my son had the crab cakes while I enjoyed the evening's special shrimp with Mediterranean rigatoni. The calamari was a little chewy but the crunch was quite nice. It came with a chimichurri sauce as well as a spiced mayo dip. The chimichurri was nice but the mayo dip could have used more kick. Our main dishes were great though. My son loved his crab cakes. They were just the right combination of moist yet flaky too. The house-made tartar sauce was fresh and quite tasty.  The special shrimp with rigatoni was terrific. It had wonderful chantrelle mushrooms in it that were meaty and delicious. The Mediterranean sauce was nice without being overly briny from the kalamata olives. The sourdough bread was nice and the olive oil dipping sauce was just right as well.  When the check came, a serving of cotton candy came with it which was a sweet touch.   All in all, it was a very nice evening and reasonably priced for a downtown hotel location. We will definitely give it another try!

Enjoyed breakfast/brunch today with a large group to celebrate a friend's graduation. The service was EXCELLENT and the food was quite tasty. We had a large party of 14 people and we were well cared for. The prices were very reasonable for a resort location and with the variety of dishes we ordered, everyone's meals were spot on. This is definitely a casual location meant for the golf/tennis crowd but it still has cloth napkins and proper china table wear. I was very impressed and look forward to a future visit!

This was our 2nd visit to this True Food location and again we were well taken care of by the staff and servers. We came twice with larger parties of peeps and the staff is more than capable to handle groups.  It does get a bit loud though which was the knock of 1 star.  I don't like having to feel like I'm yelling to my guests who are right across from me.   The food is excellent. Fresh, temperature appropriate, and delicious. Kids portions are very generous as are the adult portions. It would be easy to share a kid meal with your little one or have them share with you if your little person is a light eater.  We enjoyed the turkey lasagna, red chili shrimp, street tacos, turkey club wrap, salmon, and something else I forget...but it was also very delicious. My son enjoyed the flourless chocolate cake as well and it was delectable.   Can't wait to go back to True Food again soon!

Based on the Yelp reviews, I took my Dad here with my sons to celebrate his birthday over breakfast. The decor is fun and homey if not a little busy. We were seated right away and our server was very nice and patient as we poured over their extensive menu.  And now comes the reason for the 2 stars. Although the server was good, the kitchen was not. I ordered egg whites and got regular scrambled eggs. My son ordered a make your own omelet and they messed it up. What was interesting is that our server noticed the food was wrong while she was serving it to us and still attempted to give it to us anyway while arguing with herself that it was wrong. We turned the food back and she went back to the kitchen and reemed the kitchen staff a new @-hole. Literally. We were sitting by the kitchen and heard her yelling at them...and apparently this wasn't their first screw up of that morning.  We saw the ticket and she had clearly written it up right so this was all the kitchen's fault. At this point, our food came out in pieces. My son got his omelet but not his sides. I got my toast on one plate, bacon on another, and egg whites came out about 15 minutes after everyone else's food. Further, the "fruit cup" is basically canned fruit cocktail with a couple of cantaloup cut into it. Not cool. It was basically a big cluster----. Our server apologized profusely and frequently.   Now, in knowing that our experience was not what it should have been, our server could have given us a discount or taken a meal off or something, but nothing was offered and there didn't appear to be a manager around. I looked. Which leads me to wonder if she wasn't a manager given the way she reemed out the kitchen staff, now that I think about it.   I'll consider trying them again because it can't be that bad twice. The food, once we got it, was tasty. We will definitely need to share in the future because the portions are obscenely large. I hope next visit is better than this one.

I don't toss around 5 stars lightly. Service has to be flawless, food has to be top notch, and the entire experience needs me to be thinking about it days later. That's what I experienced at The Mission. Broken Plate Concepts truly gets that dining out isn't just dining out--it should be an experience from start to finish.   Like it's sister restaurant, House Brasserie, the restaurant is lovely.  And it's meant to be a finer dining experience so take the time to dress up. A party ahead of us who clearly hadn't planned out their experience was informed that the young men needed to remove their baseball caps. They weren't happy about it, but I appreciate that a restaurant wants to maintain a certain level of experience for everyone.  There are 2 patios, one in front and one in rear of restaurant. Both were comfortable and calming. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable, and worked very hard to make our first experience memorable. We were celebrating our anniversary and she even treated us to dessert. Classy!  So, if you're coming to The Mission, you have to have the table side guacamole. It's a must have. You can have other stuff off the starters list but if you don't get the table side guacamole, you are a fool. Seriously. It's that good. They roll out a cart filled with every ingredient imaginable to create guac and literally make guacamole right at your table to your taste. It doesn't get any fresher or better than that. The chips are warm, not too salty and more importantly, sturdy! There is nothing worse than flimsy chips that break when you are scooping salsa and/or guacamole. And let me tell you, the salsa is incredible.   Husband and I both had the street tacos; he the tecate skirt steak tacos and I the roasted butternut squash tacos. Y.U.M. We went on Saturday evening...it's now Tuesday. We are STILL talking about these tacos. The skirt steak was melt in your mouth tender and the butternut squash tacos were filling and perfectly done. Nothing worse than overcooked squash. We also had the papas y chorizo and the chipotle grits for sides. Both were delicious and unique.   Our dessert was a pumpkin bread pudding that was damn near a religious experience. Ordinarily I wouldn't pick bread pudding but I am going to have to rethink that after having this ooey, gooey, chunk of heaven. The ice cream sprinkled with cayenne was a nice touch too.   We are already planning our next visit and can't wait to try more treats!

Joined a couple of friends for lunch today and couldn't believe that the place was completely dead at 1:30PM....but then again it's a Wednesday and it is downtown....but I digress. Lunch was FANTASTIC. My son had the Carne pizza which was a pepperoni, ham, and sausage very thin crust oval shaped pizza. It could have been a bit cheesier, however, it was crispy and very tasty. One of our friends had the Prosciutto di Parma pizza which has prosciutto, arugula, shaved parmesan and was just delish with a spritz of balsamic on top. Friend 2 had the veggie sandwich which had portabello mushrooms, grilled onions on ciabatta and I had the BLT which is kind of a standby sandwich for me when I want to see how good a place is. If you can't make a good BLT, then don't bother. It was toasty with crispy bacon and was just delish. I enjoyed it with the gorgonzola slaw which is a coleslaw with gorgonzola cheese and pistachios. It was very tasty.   Service was good...drinks kept filled and friendly servers. Restaurant was spotlessly clean and I am looking forward to going back soon!

WOW what a FUN, interesting, tasty little gem in the Southwest Valley!  Our party of 4 gorged ourselves on fais do do (appetizer sample platter), shrimp etoufee, po boys and combination platters suited to fit even the most simple of palettes. I will tell you--as a healthy eater, this place does not offer many options for lower fat/lower calorie meals so use this as a 'cheat' spot. It'll be worth it. Loved the shrimp etoufee with dirty rice. It was perfectly done.   The place itself is a bit divey looking, but don't let the looks deceive you. It's super clean.  The food is really good. The service was friendly and competent. Drinks are served in mason jars which keeps things nice and COLD.   Definitely worth the drive from NorthWest Valley. :)

Walgreens is one of the best things about the Strip. It brings shopping back to reality. If you need bottled water, sodas, snacks, forgotten toiletries, even alcohol for your hotel room--dont pay hotel prices! Run over to Walgreens and pay "normal" prices! You can even get a tacky styrofoam beer cooler to keep your stuff cool while picking up deoderant that you forgot to pack or some tchotchkes to bring home. This Walgreens is located at the Venetian, but there are several now on the strip so be sure to hit one up and save your cash for gambling instead of overpriced bar drinks.

We went here for dinner last night and it was so amazing that here I am,  first thing in the morning, writing my review. In a word, Posh is AMAZING. So much so that I can't wait to go back!  Sorry Mark and Eddie, but I think I just found my new favorite place! Oh I'll be back to you, but holy cow is Posh ever good.   As has been described already in other reviews, you get a list of proteins and you can let the chefs know what you dislike and they will build a menu based on what you do like. I pretty much gave them carte blanche although husband was a bit more restrictive. We opted for the full tasting menu, his without wine pairing and mine included wine.   The service is absolutely incredible. Everyone is very friendly and non-intrusive although with selecting the full tasting menu, we saw A LOT of our server.  Several times, Joshua Hebert, the chef/owner served our dinners and he is a delight--very sweet, humble, and a refreshing change from some of the pompously overbearing chefs here in town (cough cough Chris Gross cough cough)  The food was fantastic....simply, utterly, completely fantastic. With the full tasting menu, there were 14 (no that's not a typo) different selections that came to our table including dessert. I included the foie gras and while others disliked the pairing of it with the berries, I found it quite a nice compliment to the richness of the foie gras. Each selection came just as we requested it be prepared, full of flavor, and never over done.  Our dishes truly crossed the entire spectrum of food ranging from fish to clams to beef short ribs to sweet breads, venison, duck, lamb, and beef.  We had the most delicious endive salad which was a homage to the wedge salad only bite size. And we also had an amazing sweet potato soup that was velvety and perfectly done. The only dish I didn't care for was the duck as the texture just didn't do it for me. Husband likes his meats prepared well done and he got well done every single time--not burnt--but still moist and delicious.   Since I selected to have wine pairing, each dish came with a different wine....so yeah, that's 14 different wines...well 13 because 1 dish was actually paired with a very nice beer. Each beverage was perfectly paired with each dish. Having the pairing did enhance the flavors of each dish. But I guess that my 1 complaint...14 alcoholic beverages paired with 14 dishes and this Mama was definitely drunk by the time we got outta there.  By the last 4 dishes,  my tastebuds were so inebriated, I don't think I quite got the full flavor of those dishes. I can tell you that those last 4 dishes had great textures and I'm pretty comfortable to say I liked them.  The dessert of crustless cheesecake with meringues was refreshing because it wasn't so sweet. (at least I think so haha)  The next time I go back, I will probably just order a bottle of a solid all-around kind of wine instead of doing pairing simple because I don't want to be drunk every time I go there.   The only other complaint I have is that the restaurant gets very very loud. The room is a wide open space with nothing to break up the noise. And be prepared for the obligatory arrogant Scottsdale guy who thinks he's far more important than he is, out with a woman who is so out of his league that he doesn't realize she's just there for his money. There were a few of those, but it does make for great people watching.   If you are looking for something different...something where you can just tell the chef this is what I don't like, now SURPRISE ME, Posh is your place. I can't say enough great things about this place and I really can't wait to go back!

So I found myself once again in Sun City West tonight this time to enjoy dinner with the in-laws. I have determined that if you enter the realm of Sun City, SCW, or SC Grand you are less likely to be stared and glared at if you are accompanied by a SC resident. Keep this in mind when you enter the Twilight Zone.  But the point of this review isn't to give tips on how to best deal with SC, but to tell you about a great little family restaurant called Rosie's Italian Cafe. Rosie's is nestled in Sun City West off of Meeker (also known as Reems outside of SCW) and Camino Del Sol near the True Value Hardware store. It is a cute place that recently added on another dining room when they took over the old Dominos pizza location that moved out of that strip mall. This turned out to be a good thing for Rosie's because before Dominos moved, Rosie's only served pastas, salads, and sandwiches--and NOT pizza. Which in and of itself is rather strange for an Italian restaurant. It seemed to work for them because for the most part, Rosie's has a pretty good, steady business. But, since Dominos moved out, Rosie bought their pizza ovens and voila, now Rosie's serves delicious, hot, fresh Chicago style pizza now.  Rosie's is moderately decorated with pretty floral plastic tablecloths and photographs of Chicago along with Chicago memoribilia. Nothing fancy or over the top and that's actually refreshing to not have a restaurant over do it.   Back to that pizza....and let me just tell you, that pizza is thin crust, flavorful, mouthwatering gold my friends served straight from the ovens to your table with a wink and a smile from Rosie herself.   Rosie's has a great selection of pizzas but if that's not your thing, they also have a fantastic selection of pasta dishes and a Chicken Parm dinner that is simply to die for. There are also hot and cold sandwiches, light appetizers, salads, and soups on the menu as well.  The garlic bread served with the pasta dinners is hot, but melts in your mouth from this great garlic butter sauce that they smear on it. Oy...it is so good. The salads are fresh and not wilty with a great selection of dressings.  There is a soup of the day selection so the soup variation isn't too great, but that's ok because the one soup they are serving is made fresh that day.   Rosie's had a very good, steady flow of business tonight, a Wednesday evening, and when we left, there was actually a wait list for people to get in. Rosie's also does a steady take-out business as well.  So, if you are looking for a solid family restaurant that is no frills in the West Valley, Rosie's is your place. Blue Haired chaperone not required, but definitely recommended!

Date night with the hubby never disappoints because he picks really cool places for us to try out!   We really enjoyed the Meritage Steakhouse.  It is located at the JW Marriott Hotel near Desert Ridge Mall.  The service was excellent; friendly and non-intrusive--just the way I like it. The food was very good. Not the best steak I've ever had, but I certainly wouldn't kick it out of bed in the morning either if you know what I mean.   I ordered from the Sunset menu, which is a prix fix menu that is available before 6:30PM. Our reservation was right at 6:30 so I thought it was nice that they still offered it.  I had the Meritage salad, the Filet Mignon, and creme brule as well as a flight of wines that were most delish. The salad was a mixed greens type salad with a rather tart dressing. Not so tart that I couldn't finish, but tart enough to say...wow this is tart. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly medium, just the way I like it.  It had a sauce on it that I was unfamiliar with that made it a bit sweeter than I'd like. For me, I prefer my steak naked because I want to enjoy the integrity of the meat itself...but whatever. I scraped off what I could and did my best with it.  It was accompanied by several stalks of very hearty asparagus and yukon gold mashed potatoes. The asparagus was peeled where it should be and it was cooked to al-dente perfection. The potatoes were creamy and tasty, but could have used a bit more seasoning to them. The creme brulee for dessert was very nice as well...but if you screw up creme brulee you might as well hang up your apron.  Hubby had the NY Strip with peppercorn sauce which he enjoys well done. It was cooked PERFECTLY and not dried out or overcooked in any way.  They also put his sauce on this side, which I would have preferred myself, but oh well. He had the twice baked potatoes for his side which was very creamy and cheese. He had the wedge which came with a slice of pancetta on top. Always have to have bacon on the wedge. For dessert he had a banana cream pie which was very clever. It was a chocolate mini pie shell filled with banana cream filling and topped with a length-wise slice of dried banana that was tossed with cinnamon and sugar. It was very cool and quite tasty.  We dined al-fresco as it seemed most of the other patrons chose as well. It was a lovely patio with a nice fire-pit nearby.   All in all a very nice dining experience and I'll definitely look forward to going back and trying some of their other selections!

I joined Mountainside about 3 weeks ago so I wanted to give it some time before I gave a real review. Honestly? I love it here.   The childcare is very good. The ladies are patient, kind, and clearly enjoy being with the kids. There is ample adult/kid ratio so that makes it nice. The toys are clean, not broken, and ample as well. One of the major reasons behind my selecting Mountainside is their childcare. It's super important to me that my son is well cared for but also has a lot of fun while I work out. And childcare is including in my price of membership!  Speaking of membership, there is so much included with the price of membership that it's mind blowing. They do offer classes that are above and beyond the price of membership but there is more than enough to keep your attention. The equipment is clean, always working, and there seems to be more than enough for everyone to use. I never feel like I"m bumping elbows with anybody on any machine or weights. I also like that my 12 year old can use the equipment and work out too.  The classes are great! I have taken a wide variety of classes now and each one is fun, challenging, and motivating. I'm a particular fan of the Yoga, Pilates, and "On the Ball" classes.   I also utilize the trainers which is an extra charge and my trainer, Haley, is great. She's attentive, interested, and pays attention to ME when I'm working with her. The trainers all seem very knowledgeable, helpful, and not a bunch of muscle heads like you so often see.   The locker rooms are clean, well-kept, and have lots of amenities.   All in all, I have zero complaints about Mountainside. I really enjoy the facility and am glad I took the leap from Anytime.

It's been 6 months since my last update so I felt that since the gym really does read these reviews and they do act on them, I owe them an updated review. :)  The gym itself is still 5 stars. I love the amenities, the classes, the equipment variety, I love my trainer and I love that I've dropped 3 pants sizes. The child care situation has improved SIGNIFICANTLY. The staff is much more interactive with the kids and even make the effort to greet and say good bye to all of the kids when they leave. The lady who used to make a face when my boy came in now actually seems to like him. It's nice to finally go in and not have tension. My son genuinely enjoys going to the gym and playing with the kids now. So, it took some time, but it looks like both the child-care and my son have gotten over the growing pains of their new relationship together. I'm glad that the gym makes an effort to improve based on what members describe here in YELP. Thank you for caring enough about what we think!   So with the improved childcare situation and the overall good stuff going on there, it balances out to a solid 4-stars all the way around.

Well into my 2nd year as a member at Mountainside and I have to say I am really fond of it.  The amenities, the classes, the equipment variety are all excellent but the real improvement has been in the child care area.  What was once a tumultuous relationship has now blossomed into a partnership that I appreciate. The staff is more interactive with the kids, better at conveying expectations, doesn't change the rules from day to day, and my son genuinely enjoys going to the gym to play.  I'm really glad that MS makes an effort to listen to members and cares enough to make changes.   I got a new trainer after my trainer recently left and the transition was easy with results well worth the continued expense. Trainers are a separate price from the membership and while I had not worked out with a trainer in the past, my experience with Core Concepts has been very positive. I work out with David O now and he is professional, knowledgeable and truly interested in my continued progress.  He has become a learned friend who has a vested interest in my health.   So happy I chose Mountainside for my fitness center and so happy that I can get back to giving it 5 stars.

We've been to the Golden Corral for breakfast many times and each time it gets ever so slightly worse. This most recent visit was really the final straw for me.  The food is so overly salted that I have to wonder if there is an enormous salt lick in the back that they use when heating up the food.   My son likes to drink milk and the little cartons of milk available for the kids have been spoiled the last three visits. The dates have been fine but the contents of the cartons have been spoiled to the point of becoming cheese....ew.  With that in mind...something is wrong here.   The service is sketchy at best. What starts out as a great server ends up overwhelmed, annoyed, and irritable within 30 minutes. Who knows why or what happened but all I know is that the plates stop coming and the friendliness goes out the window.   So basically...skip this place. Go down the road to the JB's in Sun City Grand. Sure the blue hairs will glare at you because you are on their turf, but at least you'll get a decent meal.

Haven't had a bad visit yet! Friendly staff and pretty tasty pizza. I do enjoy it more at the restaurant versus take out though the delivery isn't too shabby. I guess there is something to be said about it being brought to you versus schlubbing around town to get it yourself. They even deliver all the way over to me in El Mirage.   I prefer crispy thin crust (NY style) pizza and they are able to accommodate easily and happily. The toppings are fresh and not greasy. And they are great community partners by offering restaurant night fundraisers as well. Gotta love that! Looking forward to future visits!

Golden Spoon is good...not 5 star good, but it'll do on a hot friday night in Surprise after a movie. The prices are reasonable, the service is friendly and the yogurt is thick, creamy deliciousness. I'm not sure what would make this a 5 star place for me. I think perhaps the fact that the owner knows that I am a president for a non-profit and he's constantly after me to have a fundraiser with them makes me feel a bit put upon whenever I go there. I go in hoping he's not there to solicit me. I guess that takes away from the experience. If not for that, I think I'd give it 5 stars. :)

Still visiting Golden Spoon on a regular basis and just loving it. It's great on a hot night or as an after school treat. The yogurt is delicious and either low or non fat so if you are watching your weight, it's a great treat that doesn't make you feel guilty.  The staff and ownership are friendly, patient, and never make you feel rushed or like you are bothering them.   Maybe I'll head there tomorrow after school! YUM!

I go to Paradise Bakery fairly regularly in Surprise and while it's not perfect, the Chicken Walnut Salad sandwich and the chicken with wild rice soup call my name from time to time and I was taught to always come when I'm called.  I was heading out to the Wigwam today and stopped in at this Paradise Bakery location for a bite.  Lunch starts at 11. I stood right in front of the sandwich station watching a worker still making omelets and purposely said nothing, wondering when or if she would ever look up at me.  I do this from time to time to test the service and this PB failed.   I knew she knew I was there but she made a point not to make eye contact with me until my friend came over from the bakery side after ordering her smoothie to ask me what the hold up was. I then said very loudly that I was still waiting for someone to take my sandwich order. It was 11:15. The omelet worker never did look at me when she asked someone to come over and take my order.  I placed my order for my sandwich and then got my soup. I had to wait for an employee to wander over to the cash register and then realize she didn't have a cash drawer in order to pay. More meadering employees before the cash drawer came.  I didn't get my sandwich until 11:30. I ordered a 1/2 chicken walnut salad sandwich. Nothing special...no changes to it. It took 15 minutes to get it and that would be 30 minutes after changing to lunch. That's unacceptable.   I will skip this location in the future not just because of the slow change-over to lunch on a slow day but because the employees were just indifferent and slow and this is often indicative of a poor management team. I can spend my money at better places.

We love Archie's Deli! The portions are ENORMOUS and the food tastes great! The service is excellent and it is clean clean clean!  We had a party of 27 at Archie's recently for a birthday dinner and we were well accomodated and everyone raved about the food. From the Archie's Ruben to the Patty Melt, to the house made chicken noodle soup--you will not be disappointed with Archies!

Yum as always! Had the Motor City Madness which is the most delicious grilled cheese sandwich ever. I ordered a cup of tomato soup to go with it. In my opinion, it should be automatically part of the meal, but I digress. :) The soup was yum, the sandwich was buttery, cheesy, and toasty goodness. And of course I had a side of potato salad which is better than any other potato salad I've had in any other restaurant.

Another 5 star visit today at Archie's Deli! My son enjoyed Neptune's Catch which is a tuna salad sandwich with cheese on grilled rye. It was A-MAY-ZING!  My hubby had a chicken salad sandwich which was delish. I had the tomato basil soup with a salad and the soup was perfect. It was fresh, hot, and just the right texture. I had a bowl of it forgetting how enormous the portions are at Archie's and couldn't eat my salad. I'll enjoy it tomorrow at lunch. Service was great and the food was terrific. It's a can't miss trip yet again! :)

Another great visit! Met up with 2 friends and enjoyed the Grilled Cheese and tomato basil soup. Perfect on a freezing cold day like today. Friends had the reuben and the pastrami and both loved them. 1/2 size is the perfect size sandwich there but if you've got an appetite, Archie's can sure feed ya!

Just as fabulous as the Postino in Scottsdale. Went with a group of 7 and the service, food, and wine were all excellent!   I had the proscuitto and brie panini, hubby had the autostrada, son had roast beef, others had turkey, vegetarian, and chicken and mozzarella panini. I had house salad with mine that was so fresh with a perfect dressing. Others had the soup of the moment which was a white bean stew. It was amazing as always. Even the chips that accompanied my son's sandwich were crispy and not greasy at all. They were some sort of organic chip but these were more than that. They were thick, and tasted homemade.   We had the pub board, the plate, and the olives to start and we ended with the Salted Sundae which is by far, the best dessert I've ever had at any restaurant ever.   Reasonable prices, friendly service, and amazing food. What's not to love about Postino?

Came for brunch today at Postinos and it sure didn't disappoint! Had the B.E.L.T. which is Bacon Egg Lettuce and Tomato on ciabatta with dijonaisse and it was amazing. And they had no problem making it with egg whites just like I love it. My husband had the egg and bacon which he said was perfectly done. My son had it with regular eggs and they were made perfectly. One companion had the salmon and eggs and loved it. Another had the scones with an egg and bacon. The scones were light and just right--not dry like some scones can be. And the devonshire sauce was incredible. Our dishes all came with a lovely fruit bowl. I had the Mimosa which was lovely and at $5--a bargain.   I totally love Postinos for lunch and now it's my new favorite for an affordable and DELISH brunch! Not one of our meals was over $10! So worth the price of admission!

While I find the prices to be a tad on the high side for a place that's pretty divey, I will say that having a Mexican buffet is pretty unique to the area and well worth the price at $9.99. I did appreciate that they didn't charge me for my 2 year old to eat from the buffet but I didn't appreciate the lack of free refills. It doesn't say anything on the menu about not having free refills and our server didn't mention it.  The service is pleasant and friendly though, the restaurant is C-L-E-A-N, and the food is served hot and fresh. I guess I can suck it up on the lack of free refills or just order water in order to enjoy solid food with very nice service.

I'm surprised I havent updated my reviews on this place until now. I've been a guest at My Greek Corner many times since my previous review and have yet to have a bad meal. The portions are generous, the service is friendly and nice. They even do restaurant night fundraisers for the schools which was a pleasant surprise!   They have adjusted the consistency of the hummus since my last visit and it's much thicker and creamier than it was in my initial visit. Plus the side salad is a lot more proportionate. They've come a long way in the 2 years since my first review.   If you haven't been to MGC or haven't been back in a while, give it another try. I think you'll be pleasantly pleased with what you find there!

After hearing rave reviews about this place from friends and family, I figured I'd give it a try. In a nutshell, the best word I can use to describe the place is bland. Don't get me wrong, the menu is very diverse. The prices can't be beat. I had a hard time selecting an item to try because there were so many great selections to choose from. I decided to settle on something simple because in my eyes, a restaurant worth it's moxie is going to be able to handle the simple stuff perfectly. So I had a turkey and Swiss sandwich with a cup of the soup of the day which was a lemon chicken rice soup. And it was all so darn bland! The lemon soup was only slightly lemony and it had 1 piece of chicken in it and a few floaters of rice. The turkey was...strange. It wasn't like a piece carved off the turkey itself, and it wasn't deli meat either. I'm not sure if it was a bunch of pieces compacted together or what. I had it on wheat and it was toasted which is fine....but damn if it wasn't just ugh bland.   Because my husband really likes this place, I'll give it another try in the hopes that it was just an off day but man the first impression was really...bland.

Our first visit to Cartwrights was pre-Yelp and I am sad to think that it's been so long between visits but Cartwrights is located right in the center of touristy Cave Creek and that is probably the reason why.   Our recent visit was to attend a memorial luncheon. Cartwrights went out of their way to ensure our large party was comfortable and well cared for. The food was spot-on. From salads to sandwiches, to steaks, to vegan there is something for everyone. The service was prompt, friendly, and eager to please. One of the kids in the party was a bit of a pickier eater and they went out of their way to ensure she was pleased with her food...a child-A child who was not paying the bill! But going the extra mile to ensure that EVERYONE was happy is my point and what made Cartwrights a 5 star experience. Drinks were kept full, food served at the perfects temps, and the room we had was beautifully done. I will not allow so much time to pass between visits.

First visit and definitely not my last. Glad I did my homework though because what could have been a VERY expensive visit ended up not being so bad.   The slides and kids' area is well staffed although a tad bit micromanaged. I get it because safety MUST be a priority but there is a fine line that must be hard to dance around. We went in the middle of the week and the lines weren't terrible, but as the day wore on, it got pretty crowded. The Lazy River is a bit TOO lazy for my taste, but the wave pool is fun and the little kids' play area is just right for a variety of age groups.   Here are the tips I was given to make W-n-W a fun visit that won't break the bank.   1) Get there early so you can get a spot in the shade. This is critical because well...Arizona is hot. (duh)  2) Pack your own lunch in a cooler to leave in your car. When you want to eat, go out to the car and enjoy a picnic lunch there. This saved me AT LEAST $100 because food is RIDICULOUSLY expensive.   3) You CAN bring in sealed water bottles to the park. Sippy cups have to be empty so unless you are breastfeeding, don't expect your little ones to have their juices or anything like that brought in.  4) WEAR FLIP FLOPS or AQUA SOCKS. The ground is searing and when you are waiting to get on some of these slides, your feet will melt off--literally-if you aren't wearing shoes.   5) Save-Around guide has discount coupons if you're only going once and Luke AFB has discounts for Vets and current military. However, if you are planning to go multiple times this summer, the summer pass is worth it.   6) Only bring in what you absolutely need. Lockers are pricey and if you buy your tickets online, you won't even need to bring in your wallet and can lock it in the trunk of your car.   7) Sunscreen sunscreen sunscreen. Oh and sunscreen.

Another fun visit! I am a big fan of the Pear Chicken salad. Lovely goat cheese that gets all melty from the warm grilled chicken...mmmmm. The mango iced tea is nice too. Not too sweet or too fruity. It's nice to have healthy choices amid the movie theater and Grimaldis..which I love. :) Definitely hit this place up. The burgers are yum and definitely give this salad a try!

Have been to Birt's a few times now and am a fan! The food is delicious and the atmosphere is unique. The restaurant is IN the bookstore. Like literally--you are surrounded by books. That has it's pluses and minuses. The pluses is that it makes for interesting conversation pieces. The minus is that the customers will literally reach over you to pull a book off the shelf. (TACKY but true story).   There is an upstairs section to the restaurant which is a nice touch, but it makes serving difficult. Servers aren't as eager to take care of the upstairs customers and continually go up and down the stairs. If you want to be left alone, that's the place to sit...but if you need anything, you might find yourself going downstairs on your own to get drink refills.   Overall, this is a cute little spot that is quite unique. I will be back!

Skeptical is a good way to describe my initial feelings when we arrived at the Bluewater Grill. The decor is very reminiscent of 80s Red Lobster so my expectations were low despite the location of this restaurant.  Boy was I in for a surprise though. Fish was DELICIOUS. Fresh, perfectly cooked, exactly as ordered. Husband had fish and chips and they were not breaded to death pieces of unknown fish. They were just right pieces of fresh cod. I had the scallop and shrimp skewers and they were perfect. It's so easy to over do scallops but these were on the money. Our server was a delight and even hurried things along when we told her we were heading to a show.   I am very much looking forward to a return trip to dive into the menu a bit more thoroughly!   Thanks Bluewater Grill for exceeding my expectations!

We have driven by this place so many times and didn't try it because we thought--yay--another dive bar...they won't be here long. Were we ever wrong! This place has been here in Surprise for at least 5 years now; standing strong against all the other restaurants that have come and gone in this particular strip mall. I'm not sure why, but as we were driving by, I thought--WHY NOT? So my son and I went in for lunch. As we walked in we were pleasantly surprised to see how busy it was, in the middle of the day in the middle of the week.  We were greeted and seated promptly. . We both enjoyed tacos for lunch that were out of this world! My son had the firecracker shrimp tacos which he loved and I had a chicken taco special that was excellent. We were pleased with the service and how quickly our food came out considering the place was packed. We are looking forward to a return trip with the rest of the family!

Fan-freakin-tastic.   Ok. I know I need to give you more than that, but let's just start with Fan-Freakin-Tastic. Went last night with the hubby who will likely write his own review so you get the male perspective, but this place is just excellent...reasonably priced...with delicous food....and a BITCH of a grenache that is outta this world!  The restaurant is nicely lit, not overly bright, but not so dark you can't see what you are doing. And there is patio seating in back complete with heat lamps so we enjoyed our dinner al fresco! Love this!  John was our server and he was knowledgeable, friendly, polite, and made sure our drinks stayed full and our food was brought out at the right temperature. This might seem mundane, but that is truly an art in and of itself.   We started off our meal with the antipasto plate and olives. The grape tomatoes are marinated in balsamic and something else and they were heavenly. The meats and cheeses paired so nicely together that I almost wish we had ordered two platters and made it dinner! The goat cheese was so creamy that it melted literally in my mouth. Absolutely divine. The olives were a nice variety though  I can't tell you what kind they were. There were a couple of spicier ones which added a pleasant kick.   Hubby and I shared the strawberry and gorgonzola salad. This is super yummy. The strawberries and gorgonzola paired nicely together with the toasted pecans and the mixed greens. It was perfectly dressed with a lovely viniagrette that just kissed the leaves of the salad.   Hubby ordered the 5th and Wine burger for dinner as he adores a really good burger. The burger comes with a side of garlic aioli and crispy french fries. These fries were well seasoned and were in fact crispy--shocking, I know! The burger....well let's just say I'm lucky to have been allowed a minor bite of it because hubby LOVED IT. it was deliciously seasoned and didn't even need the aioli. Hubs likes his meat cooked well done and this burger was perfectly so while still juicy!   I ordred the Chicken Pesto Pasta. In my opinion, soup and pasta are the best ways to judge whether a kitchen is any good because those are two very basic things that get very messed up if a kitchen has no skill. 5th and Wine definitely knows their stuff. This dish comes with just the right amount of bow-tie pasta delicated dressed in a pesto creamy sauce with grilled chicken breast throughout. So much chicken that I had a piece in nearly every bite of my dish and that's saying something. The chicken was perfectly done--not dried out like so many other places do where they hope the sauce will save it. No. This chicken was beautifully seasoned and was cut into chunks so that it matched the size of the bow-ties. I usually try to leave a little behind but I ate every single last bite. And as I sat there, I contemplated whether or not I needed bread to sop up the last bits of goodness left in the bowl and realized I didn't even miss a piece of bread to go with my pasta. These chefs at 5th and Wine...they've got it down.  On to dessert. Since 5th and Wine is still new, they are still working on their dessert menu. Their only offerings were cheesecake and a brownie. I wanted to try both but hubby was too stuffed so we opted to share the brownie. The brownie came out and looked like a brownie...not a piece of brownie colored cake like you get at so many other places. This was warm and topped with a delicious chocolate sauce, raspberries and vanilla ice cream. The perfect ending to a really great meal.  The drinks were fab. Hubby had a rum and coke and then switched to the Bitch grenache with me. I had a merlot to start which was subtle and not overly oaky. The grenache however stole the show. It had a velvety aftertaste that leaves me wanting to go back again real soon to enjoy some more!   This little place has got it going on and you get Phoenix price with a Scottsdale atmosphere. I'm looking forward to my next visit with the girlfriends!

Went back on Friday night with my 5 best friends and we had a blast! The food was just as terrific and the wine was flowing perfectly. Service was friendly and unintrusive.   And we got to try the Beef Bourginon. O. M. G. Talk about melt in your mouth goodness! It was amazing.   The turkey panini was wonderful and the side of butternut squash soup was velvety and served piping hot. Just the way we like it!  I had the chicken pesto pasta again. I know I know...I should try something new, but man is it ever good.  Two friends had the strawberry and gorgonzola salad while one added grilled chicken to it.  Loved it!  We tried the calamari and it was breaded and fried perfectly. I hate when calamari is chewy and over-done and this was fried perfectly. We also had the antipasto plate as well. The tomatoes...oh goodness I do love those tomatoes.  And we shared both the brownie and the cheesecake. The cheesecake is a tall slice of melt-in-your-mouth piece of heaven.  The brownie should have been served warm like it was last time but that's ok. It was still amazing.   Great job to Scott and Scott--the managers. You are doing amazing work!

Another amazing visit to 5th and Wine with my friends! Dinner was amazing! Service was above and beyond. We are all changing our eating habits and the server was kind enough to split all of  our dishes for us so that we had smaller, more reasonable portions. That was way beyond our expectation and definitely not what we've been used to in recent months.  Beef Bourginon again was awesome. The strawberry gorgonzola salad is perfectly dressed. We also had the chicken picatta and butternut squash soup. Sooo good.   Love 5th and Wine. Can't wait to go back.

Party of 16? No problem at 5th and Wine--well with a well in advance reservation that is!! The joint was hopping last night when we arrived for dinner!  We had an awesome time. Service was on point, the music was great (Jack Young was playing), and the food was delicious as always. Thanks Scott Yanni and the crew for making us welcome and taking good care of us. Many of our group were newcomers to the place and everyone said they can't wait to be back!  Why haven't YOU gone to 5th and Wine yet?

Another great visit and another great beef bourguignon! One day I will try something different. Maybe next time. We'll see.   Our service was spot on as usual and the food was hot and delish. Drinks were always full and our server was professional, friendly, and not intrusive at all. The music of Ivan Harshman was perfect. He's very talented singer/guitar player. First time we've heard him. I'll definitely come back for another Ivan night.   Calamari was perfect, cheese plate was fresh and the goat cheese was creamy and wonderful. 5th and Wine burger was amazing according to son and hubby who shared since the burger is really big. Beef Bourguignon was melt-in-your mouth bits of heaven. There was a nice array of ice cream choices including caramel and mint chocolate chip for dessert which was an evening special.   So yummy.  But I think next time I'm going to make an effort to try something new. That beef calls my name but I shall try to resist....

Another 5 star visit to 5th and Wine this past Saturday night! Went out with friends to celebrate a birthday and of course we were not disappointed.  I know I said last time I would try something new but damn that beef bourguignon is good....I promise myself though, next time I go, I'm getting the chicken pot pie. Birthday girl got it and I had a taste...O.M.G. the crust was flakey and the stuffings were absolutely AMAZING!  Husband had the 5th and Wine burger as did another friend. That is really an amazing burger. It is just perfect.   Appetizers included the fried pickles, the cheese platter and the antipasto and each was delicious and served at perfect temperature. Our drinks were kept filled and the alcohol was flowing...well except for me...pregnant lady enjoyed her iced tea though! :) My hubby and a friend enjoyed rum and cokes and actually had to ask for the coke can to be brought to the table so they could water down the drinks! Never had that happen before so that shows that you are definitely getting what you paid for in the drink department.  We even enjoyed dessert which included a brownie sundae for the birthday girl and an ENORMOUS slice of cheesecake. The cheesecake was so big I thought we were eating at Claim Jumper!   Service was perfect as always--attentive, friendly, and never intrusive. Hot food came out hot and cold food came out cold. Dishes were cleared promptly which is something that is important to me. I hate when the dirties are just left sitting there.   Great music, great fun, fabulous food...again, why have you not eaten at 5th and Wine? I can't wait to go back!

Another great visit to 5th and Wine recently! Went with a group of 9 friends to celebrate a birthday. Chicken Pot Pie is a MUST HAVE as is the Sloppy Joe. Music on the patio is great. Service is EXCELLENT. Scott Yanni and staff really have things down pat. This is a definite MUST GO place in Scottsdale and worth the drive for us West-Siders.

I've been back to Picazzo's several times since my review last year and I am remiss in updating my review.   Picazzos has been GREAT since my first review. The pizza is amazing. The pasta is delicious. We've gotten take out and eaten in and all were good experiences. TDishes we've enjoyed include the butternut squash ravioli, the pasta diviolo, the California pizza, and the Sweet and Sassy! The salads are fresh and aren't overdone.   he staff is a bit hit or miss hence the 4 star review, but I would say all in all, Picazzos is definitely worthy to give a try to some night soon!

Self serve frozen yogurt? What's not to love? Great selection, excellent taste, and a toppings bar that can't be beat! We come here regularly and for those of you looking for a good fundraising location, yes, they do offer fundraising for non-profits! Will be back soon!

Enjoyed lunch today with friends and my gourmet son at Pita Jungle. It's hip and trendy, but don't let that stop you from coming to visit. The food was very good.   Since the weather is so nice out, we were able to take advantage of patio dining. Our server was nice, but honestly, I don't remember her name. In fact, I'm not sure she introduced herself, but one of my friends knew her from a previous restaurant they both worked at.  We enjoyed the falafel platter and the small hummus as starters. The falafel was flavorful, tender, and not overdone at all. I hate hockey puck falafel. My vegetarian friend enjoyed the roasted vegetable salad, my son had the pesto pizza, our other friends had the lavosh pizza, and I had the chicken schwarma pita. All were very tasty. My son enjoyed his pizza so much that he didn't even speak the entire meal.   I'm looking forward to coming back soon to try out some other treats! I have been told via my Facebook Check-In that I MUST try the nachos so next time, it's on my list!

While I'm still searching for a new stylist, my hair just keeps on growing so I decided to give Great Clips a try today. I've never been to a Great Clips before and I used their iPhone app to "check in" to get put on the waiting list as I'm sure on a Saturday, it gets quite busy. I only had to wait about 5 minutes and this location wasn't that busy at all as I got there right at 8:05 AM and they open at 8. There were 3 older gentlemen ahead of me. I think it helps that this store is tucked in over by Vogue Bistro instead of right by the road as I'm sure it would have been a total zoo on a Saturday AM.   Christina cut my hair and she was friendly, polite, and listened when I told her what I wanted. I have super thick hair and it probably would have been easier for her to just wash my hair first in the sink, it would have cost me an additional $4. Not that $4 is a big deal, but my hair tends to laugh at the water bottle spritz. Either way, it worked out ok. It only cost me $13 for my cut...it was fast, easy, and Christina did a nice job.  What I wish is that instead of perm services, they offered COLORING because I am getting sick of doing my own coloring, but I didn't know they didn't offer coloring so had to zip to Bashas next door to get a box of Garnier. Besides, does ANYBODY perm anymore?   Would I go back? Probably...if I only need a haircut and no other services. The store was very tidy, the ladies were super nice, and my haircut was well done. The mobile app was cool and easy to use and made checking in easy.

My 13 month old LOVES his Gymbo class! This location not only offers interactive play specific to your child's age group but when you sign up, you can come as often as you like and even partake in the open gym time at no additional charge! Plus you get Gym-Bucks which can be used in Gymboree's retail stores just for being a member of Gymboree Play! You aren't set in stone to one specific class date/time which is great because toddlers can be so unpredictable! :) The class leaders are nice, friendly, and explain how each section of the lesson we are learning will help teach our babies a specific skill set. The other parents who attend the classes are friendly and attentive to their children which is great! Nothing worse than inattentive parents! The gym is spic and span and I am so glad that after 10 years since our last baby, we are still pop pop popping all the bubbles out here at Gymboree!

This Kohl's is a fantastic treasure in Surprise versus the store located on Bell Rd. The staff is polite and helpful, the store is CLEAN and the clothes are even on the proper hangers! Although it's still important to make sure to check the size on the hanger versus the actual size of the item, you are less likely to have an error at this store than the one on Bell Rd.    I honestly hesitate to review this place so highly because I don't want it to get overrun but I can't help but gush about it.

Love going to the games--whether they win or lose. Great people watching, good food selections though I wish they had more healthier choices. The bathrooms could always use work but all in all, a nice facility. The workers are nice and the fans for the most part are manageable. The team has moments of greatness and hopefully, one day, they will regain their 2001 glory. :) But I do so love baseball and always look forward to a visit to see my Diamondbacks.

Always busy at this location. The staff is friendly, polite, and helpful. Love when people make eye contact with me when I'm talking to them. I realize that's probably a little thing but it makes a big difference to me. This location is always clean, bright, and even the bathrooms are clean too.  The food is good enough.  I usually get a salad and its pretty yum. The guacamole is worth the price of admission. All in all, a good go-to place for lunch! :) Wish they had a drive thru!

Good pizza, pleasant staff, cold beer--everything you could want in a good pizza joint. Nice to get seated right away and although the restaurant was busy, the staff wasn't frazzled or indifferent at all like they get at Grimaldi's. We are definitely going back and I'm looking forward to it.

Wow. and I'll say it again. Wow. I felt like such a grown-up staying at this hotel but I mean that in the best possible way. The Cosmo has it going on when it comes to great service and minding all the details! The casino located on the main floor is sprawling with a nice variety of games. They do make an effort to keep the riff raff out which is nice.  The 2nd floor has all the stores which are the typical hotel-boutiquey stores. There are very unique stores tho which was a nice change. The third floor is where all the restaurants are and if you are good at exploring, you'll find the Secret Pizza place! :) The Wicked Spoon buffet is one of the most amazing buffets I've ever been to.   Now for the rooms. Our room was so posh and beautiful. Lush fabrics, super soft pillows, a fabulous sitting area, and jets in the bath tub. A-Maz-Ing! We had a beautiful view of the strip from our room and my favorite part was how quiet it was at night. It was a busy weekend in Vegas but you'd never know with the quality of the noise reducing walls and doors!   The staff was so friendly and genuinely nice. Such a nice change from other Vegas hotels where the staff barely looks at you. They truly made you feel at home in the hotel and no request was too big.   I can't wait to go back to the Cosmo. Hell, I'd move in if I could!

Met up with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday and we had a great time! Our waiter was friendly and fun--even buying birthday boy a shot of tequila! Gotta love that! Food was enjoyable though not anything you haven't had before but it was satisfying enough and the drinks were kept full. Can't beat that! The mariachi band was EXCELLENT and a lot of fun. It's a little pricey but then, what isn't on the strip anymore?

I'm a major FRO-YO fan and had been meaning to try this tucked away little gem for quite a while now and believe me, I am SO GLAD that I did. Stopped in last week with my sons after hitting up the Skechers store for some new kicks. I have to say I am so sorry that it's taken me so long to try this place out. Of all the FRO-YO places I've tried, this is hands down--THE BEST! So why not a 5-star rating?   What I didn't like:  *They don't do school fundraisers. According to the guy working the counter, the owner doesn't want the hassle. That's too bad because with this little gem in a tucked away corner of Westgate, school fundraisers would be a great way to get the word out about the business and help the community at the same time.   *According to front counter guy, they also don't have a frequent guest punch card or anything to encourage loyalty.   What I liked: *They DO use YELP to give discounts and if you are a Facebook Fan of theirs, they have all sorts of discounts as well. Use the "check-in" features on Yelp's mobile app and get your discounts or mention the FB discounts and you're golden.  *Awesome selection of FRO-YO. I had Carmel Pecan and Peanut Butter. OMG they were to die for. If I could have put my mouth under the spiget of Carmel Pecan, that would have been an excellent way to die. My boy had the mixed berry sorbet and he just loved it.   *Excellent selection of toppings. From nuts to berries, candy to Trix cereal, there is something for every pallet to top your FRO-YO.   *Fun decor. One wall is actually textured to look like ocean waves. The furniture is comfy and modern.   *Nice staff. While I was sad about the school fundraiser and loyalty answers, the counter guy was polite, friendly, courteous and thanked me three times for stopping in.  So, if you are all about helping local businesses like I am...hit up Ocean Blue. I'm going tomorrow so maybe I'll see you there!

While the food was pretty good, the $72 price tag (with tip included--gee thanks) definitely made the meal less appealing. We visited the buffet after coming to Talking Stick to see a concert and thought it would be a good bet. The wait to be seated was ridiculous. There were tables open and we were a party of 6. The staff refused to push tables together or seat us at a bigger table as there 'might be a bigger party waiting in line who needs it'. They stopped letting people in because it was at capacity...but those tables sat empty. And those tables sat empty the entire time we were there. The food was just alright with some dishes more of a standout than others. But for the most part, it was just meh. IF we ever go back to Talking Stick--and that's highly unlikely for reasons completely separate from this buffet, we will definitely skip this restaurant.

I will start off by saying this--I am NOT a NASCAR fan. I know peripherally about those who race in it and some minor ins and outs but I am far from what anyone would call 'a fan'. That said--NASCAR HOF is INCREDIBLE. What a collection of classic to modern day race cars. All of the trophies, auto parts, how they work,hands on stuff is amazing. I got to drive inside a race car model like it was the real deal. I got to change a tire like they do in the pit crew. It is AWESOME. I highly recommend a visit there in your near future. :)

It's been a while since I've been to a pumpkin patch as my son is now 10 and it doesn't interest him like it used to...but now that we have a baby in our midst, we get to enjoy all of those fun things all over again!  I've been to several pumpkin patches around the Valley over the years and MacDonald's Ranch is just as good as anybody else's patch.  What they do have over the others is more exposure to the animals at the ranch as well as a fun hayride. The hayride leads out to a staged pumpkin patch area rather than an actual patch, but it is a different experience versus other places I've been. There is a petting zoo and random animals walking around the ranch, as well as pony rides/horseback rides too.   There was plenty of parking and it was very crowded today when we went, but not so terrible that it sucked the fun out of our trip.      I just wish for once that it wouldn't be 90 freaking degrees every year that I go to a pumpkin patch but such is the nature of the beast in AZ. Of course that is of no consequence to this review as only God can control that.   All in all, it was worth the trip and the $8 price of admission each. Had we just gone with our baby, it wouldn't have been worth it so consider bringing at least 3 years old and up to really get your money's worth.

Wow what a bustling nail shop! I went in on Saturday for a pedicure and some quiet time. This spa was PACKED but they were able to take me right away. Friendly, courteous, and an hour later, I had cute toes and a relaxed demeanor to continue on with the rest of my day!  Looking forward to going back soon!

We've been to Hayashi several times now with larger groups and we've always had a good time. We've always sat at the hibatchis  which is fun and lends for an interesting evening.    We've been to Benihanas several times and honestly, the food is better at Hayashi. We all had different items and everything was cooked to perfection. Nothing was dried out or under seasoned like you often get at Benihanas. JC was our chef and he was funny, entertaining, and fit right in with our rowdy crowd.  The only reason why I didn't give this a 5 star rating is that the drink service was SO FREAKING SLOW! Granted, the restaurant was jumping but it was a really long time between refills and I really hate that and its been like that every time I've gone there.

Popcornopolis came out to sell popcorn at our Fall Festival all the way out here in Surprise and it was a HUGE hit! They have been doing fundraisers for us for a while now and Maria is wonderful! I've had the cheddar, nearly naked, kettlecorn, cinnamon toast and ZEBRA CORN. I put the ZEBRA CORN in all caps because Dah-am is it ever amazing. We sell it by the cone for fundraisers and it is BY FAR the best selling of all the flavors. Chocolately goodness over salty popcorn is heavenly.   As fundraisers go, I can't recommend Popcornopolis enough. Maria is helpful, knowledgeable, and easy to work with. The popcorn is so fresh you'd think they popped it at that very moment. It's a long drive to their shop for me, but I will be making the trek out there soon because I really want to stock up for the holidays!

Dear Bueno Burger, I love you. Maybe that's a bit forward after my first visit today, but I do and I can't be ashamed to hide my love for you. From your mesquite grill, to your pickled jalapenos, to the fresh guacamole on top of my perfectly cooked bueno style burger, I find you remarkably attractive. Your french fries were hot, fresh, and perfectly made. Your onion rings were tasty and not too breaded. Your store is clean, neat, and brightly lit with it's beautiful modern booths and tables. Your fountain drinks were typical but well stocked.  Your staff is friendly, polite, and helpful to a new-comer like me. My dear sweet Bueno Burger, I'll try not to be too overbearing with my visits because you are kind of a far drive from my house but you are oh so worth the trip and worth spending my weight watchers points on any day of the week. Until we meet again.....  Faithfully yours, Beth S.

I have visited Bliss ReBAR twice now and have enjoyed both visits in their own unique way.  My first visit was as a date night with my husband. Delicious street tacos and he had the mac and cheese. The sangria was excellent and the patio was delightful. I liked how the restaurant was separate from the bar and one didn't intrude upon the other. It was a nice atmosphere, service was prompt and food was served at just the right temps.   My second visit was an entirely different experience. Not to say it was bad...just different. I went with a friend before we went to the Bette Midler show which was on a Sunday evening. I made reservations online via their website. We showed up and the restaurant side of the business was closed, blocked off, and appeared to have been that way for some time. My friend and I looked at each other and headed over to the bar side to get an explanation. We stood there for a while at the entrance because the sign at the outside hostess stand said to come inside the bar. So we went back outside, stood by the hostess stand and suddenly the hostess appeared. She seated us inside the bar at a table. We were greeted promptly and handed menus. The bar was pretty full for 5PM on a Sunday and when the waiter returned I asked him about the restaurant side being closed. He explained that the restaurant side closes down on Sundays after 3PM. I mentioned that the website didn't say anything about that and I was surprised that they would take a reservation for dinner when the restaurant is technically closed. He said that the kitchen is open with all the same food--they just close the restaurant side in order to keep the electrical bill down. Ok...makes sense. We ordered, got our food, and all was fine. Just as good of an eating experience as the previous time but with a more colorful crowd. Bliss ReBAR seems to be a haven for gay men which is totally fine with me, but if you have a problem with that, Bliss isn't the place for you. My friend and I had a great time and the other patrons were fun, interesting, and made for great dining companions.   I will definitely go back to Bliss and am already looking forward to having those tasty street tacos again!

What is not to love about Charming Charlie? You don't have to be the most girlie girl in the world to enjoy Charlie's array of selection. And boy is there a selection! The store is arranged by color and every color of the rainbow is represented, including black, white, silver, and gold! There are some apparel choices, some shoes, but it's about accessories. There are accessories to meet, fit, or challenge any personal style. It has really helped me to branch out and try bolder styles without breaking the bank!  The only reason I don't give this store 5 stars is because the staff was non-existent. There was no one helping customers--much less even saying HELLO for that matter.    I did have a fun visit there though and I will go back because it's not terribly far from me, but I'll keep in mind the staff's lack of enthusiasm. That's not representative of how other Charlie locations are so don't let that deter you.

Fun concept and an excellent place to run off some preschooler energy! Place is clean and well maintained.  The kids who work there are YOUNG so be patient but they do their best to keep the guests happy.   There is a multitude of things to do although I do enjoy the preschooler area quite a bit. Between the bounce houses there and the big trampolines, they get a good workout.  The older kids have way more allotted to them, but they need more to entertain them. I brought my 3 and 13 year olds and they both really enjoyed themselves in the 2 hours we were there. And 2 hours was definitely enough.   If you follow them on instagram, you get $2 off which helps but they don't allow for re-entry if you leave so plan your time here accordingly. They do have cubbies for your things which helps too.  Be prepared for the brussel sprout/foot smell. It is pungent.

Have had several desserts from this shop and the one word that comes to mind whenever I think of this place is "dry".   Every dessert, from the cookies to the cupcakes, to the loafettes are all d.r.y.   I wish I could say more but I think that pretty much sums it up.

An absolutely impeccable 5-Star evening with the husband celebrating Valentine's Day a day late. It has been a while since I've enjoyed a true 5-Star evening and our dinner at The House was pure heaven.   Our server, Karen, was an absolute pro. She made great suggestions, had intimate knowledge of the menu and the specials, she was interesting but not intrusive, and she was everything I want in a server.   We sat outside in the garden and it was just lovely although as the evening stretched on, it did get a bit chilly despite the heat lamps and sitting next to the fireplace. The garden is beautiful though and even though the restaurant is right off of Baseline Rd. you don't hear the noise of the road at all.  Now on to the food. Oh my. The food. We enjoyed the cheese board and the Fried Arancini with Tomato Sauce which are fried risotto balls to start. We chose white cheddar, parmesan, and brie and it was wonderful accompanied with dried cherries, golden raisins and the candied figs were to die for over grilled toast points. The fried arancini was awesome. Toasty and crunchy on the outside, but creamy and cheesy on the inside.   Our second course included the cauliflower soup and field green salad. The soup has a hint of serrano pepper to it which added a nice heat on the back of the throat. I had the Mango and Serrano Mojito which really paired nicely with it. The field green salad had a delicious lemony dressing that really made the salad pop.  My husband had the rib eye and I had the shrimp and grits for our main dishes. My husband prefers his steak well done and the House did not disappoint. The steak was well done but still juicy and delicious inside. The shrimp and grits were PERFECT. The shrimp was perfectly seasoned and just right in doneness. The grits were creamy and not grainy at all. The bacon and carrots in the grits added just the right amount of salty crunch that really made this a well rounded dish. For dessert, I had the cannolis. What made it that much more special was the strawberries that were garnishing the plate had the cannoli filling piped on top. O.M.G. That should have been the dessert in and of themselves!  Every facet of our dinner at The House at Secret Garden was just right. I cannot wait to go back and I sure hope Karen will be our server! I will say this though....do not plan to rush through this meal. This meal is meant to be savored, relished, and enjoyed. Our reservation was at 6:30 and we didn't get out of there until 9:15 and we enjoyed every single second of our meal. If you are in a big rush, don't come to The House because you will not get out of it what you are truly meant to get out of being there. It is a gastronomic experience, not some fast-food bing, bang, boom b.s. Take your time, sit back, and truly enjoy the experience.

Once again an impeccable 5 star evening! We enjoyed Valentine's dinner with the special menu that really should have been titled Tony and Beth because it's exactly what we would have ordered anyway! I had the carrot soup, the scallops, and the chocolate marquise for dessert. My husband had the mozzarella salad, the hangar steak, and the milk and cookies panna cotta.   Scallops can be dicey but man they sure do a great job at House! They were perfectly done. The cauliflower side dish 3 ways was excellent. The carrot soup was so warm and velvety. The chocolate marquise...holy cow though....I couldn't even speak it was so good.   The hangar steak was well seasoned but not overly so. The mozzarella salad with hand pulled mozzarella was dressed perfectly and was just enough. The milk and cookies panna cotta was the perfect way to end the meal.   Couple that with the delicious drinks, the gorgeous atmosphere, and our super server, it made for another great visit! Can't wait to go back!

Vision has been our community's management company for several years now. At first glance, our community seems ok. The parks look nice and the streets are relatively clean. The communal areas are kept up nicely. However, if you really take the time to look around, our community has gone significantly downhill since their taking the helm. We have been through at least 4 community managers and each one has been more blind than the next to the blatant violations that occur throughout our community. For example, there has been a huge picture of Jesus in the bushes of one of the communal areas near the main road for 2 weeks now. It caught my eye one day when the sun glimmered off of the glass. How after all this time the community manager hasn't noticed it is beyond me...but it definitely solidifies my feeling that they really aren't looking...if they are even here at all!  I suppose that it must be a perk however, to be on the HOA board of directors because those guys are the worst violators of them all.   With respect to contacting Vision about concerns, you get a snide, exasperated response from Hannah. I kind of feel sorry for her because she has to be the one to hear all the crap from all the residents and unfortunately because her company sucks so bad--she never get the chance to hear very much in the way of positivity. I called her recently to try to communicate with her about the road work that the city was planning and she wasn't quite sure how to handle a conversation with someone who was seeking a win/win. Maybe she's nice in her non-work life though I'll never know and hopefully Vision will someday be the company she wants it to be because honestly, she doesn't deserve all the abuse she gets simply because Vision sucks.   I hope someday our HOA board will get its nose out of Vision's ass and price out a new management company. Our old company was actually very good but there was a lot of stupid drama that caused the change in the first place. It would be nice if people who joined boards actually represented the needs of the people and not had personal agendas but it is what it is.

We really enjoyed our visit to True Food Kitchen. The service was excellent and the food was...FRESH! I had the watermelon and heirloom tomato salad. It was scrumptious. The place was open, airy, and fun! I would definitely go back the next time I'm in the Scottsdale Quarter and bring friends too!

Where have I been that I haven't visited Nordstrom Rack until recently? Shame on me! Great prices and great Nordies tried and true items. I particularly liked the kids section. Great clothes and REASONABLE prices. My kids are looking great at prices I can afford. The staff was super nice and very professional....and I could get my receipt emailed to me. We will definitely be back. Thank you!

Sunshine Moon Peking Pub opened on Friday evening and my hubby and I were there the next night to give it a try! Located within walking distance of 5th and Wine and run by the same great people, Sunshine Moon's decor is fresh, vibrant, and not ridiculously flamboyant in it's Oriental flair like so many other places can be.  The menu is a good selection although it's nothing you haven't seen before. My hubby had the Mongolian Beef which was the most tender beef I've had since eating the Beef Bourginon at 5th and Wine. It literally melted in your mouth. I had THE General's Chicken. It had just the right amount of spice to the chicken that it wasn't overwhelming but lots of good kick. We were served crispy fried won tons while we waited for our entrees and the dipping sauce had a nice warmth in the back of your throat which was pleasant.  The dessert, Tempura Ice Cream, was really a nice way to end the meal and cleanse the palate after the heat of the chili from the General's Chicken. I wish the Tempura was a little crispier but the ice cream was lovely and the creamy creme anglaise and raspberry sauce was perfect with it.   I am hoping they will add Mu Shu items to the menu as that it my favorite but all in all the menu is solid. With Mongolian Beef that tender, this restaurant is sure to get a good following. Further, the cut above the rest is the beer and wine selections.  Scott Yanni has done it again with his pairings and I think this will definitely lend to the success of this new venture!  The service was excellent as well. Rachel was our server and she was professional, knowledgeable, and friendly. Her recommendations were spot on and our food was piping hot when brought to us.   All in all, I'm looking forward to bringing friends and family to this new gem in Old Scottsdale and adding it to our repertoire. I just hope they add Mu Shu to the menu! hint hint! :)

Took my best girlfriends to SMPP last night for our Girls' Night Out and we had a blast! It was their first time and all 3 were very impressed. We love 5th and Wine and I knew they would love SMPP just as much since it's owned and operated by the same fantastic people! We had a Groupon which was taken with a smile as well.   Our server was friendly, fun, and took our GNO behavior like a pro. :) He nearly became part of our family by the time we left.   The food, in a word, was just spectacular. We had the Crab Wontons and the Vegetable Spring Rolls to start. Both had interesting and appropriate dipping sauces We always eat Family Style so we shared the Mongolian Beef, Shrimp in Lobster Sauce, Soft Noodle/Fried Egg and the Kung Pao Shrimp. I wasn't sure about the Soft Noodle/Fried Egg because it just seemed strange, but it was absolutely heavenly. Everything was perfectly made. The shrimp seemed to snap when you bite into them. The Kung Pao was spicy without being overpowering.  The Shrimp in Lobster Sauce was decadent. The Mongolian Beef was tender and perfectly seasoned. Everything just tasted FRESH. Clearly the ingredients hadn't been sitting around and nothing had been premade or had sat under a heat lamp. Everything was nicely seasoned with a nice mixture of flavors without being overpowering.  We topped off the meal with the Tempura Fried Ice Cream and the Peanut Butter Chocolate Mousse. We loved both equally and they were perfect endings to a really great meal.   Can't wait to go back again and bring more friends to this jewel. Thank you for a fun, fabulous experience!

After the less than underwhelming lunch we had the day before at Bobby Flays Mesa Grill, I was reluctant to do burgers again but I'm so very glad I did. Holsteins does right everything that Bobby Flay's does wrong. The service was attentive, upbeat, got our order correct and the food was SPOT ON! I enjoyed the Candy Cane boozy shake which was very yummy and almost a meal in itself...but the winner was the burger. I had the Gold Standard burger and it definitely lived up to its name. Perfectly cooked to medium; bacon had a good bite to it, not too much lettuce and tomato so that it complimented instead of overwhelmed the burger. The aioli was super yum too. The seasoning on the burger enhanced the meat but the star was the meat itself. The burger was tender, juicy, and was as it should be if you were making it on your own grill at home. I had the shoestring fries which were clearly hand cut and cooked to order. They were crunchy on the outside but fluffy on the inside. My husband had the Nom-Nom burger. He initially took the chips off the burger but put them back on when he saw how much they complimented his burger and added the perfect crunch. He orders his burgers well done and the waitress didn't even flinch as some often do. It was done perfectly...and still had that juiciness that a good burger should have without the redness. We will absolutely be back to try more yummy goodness at Holsteins. Thank you for renewing my confidence that there CAN be upscale burgers that are truly done right.

I have had many experiences at Vegas buffets over the years and I can tell you that my experience at Wicked Spoon left me positively giddy and going from station to station to thank the chefs for going the extra mile to make each dish perfect.   The buffet was fresh and colorful with such a wide array of foods served in their own serving vessels. We enjoyed breakfast (complimentary due to my husband's platinum status at the hotel) and we were so pleasantly thrilled with the experience. The omelets were made perfectly. The pancakes were fluffy and delicious. The salads were cold and fresh. The fruit was perfectly in season. The individual serving dishes of butternut squash ravioli and mac-and-cheese orechette made it easy to not over-eat. The pizza was crispy with perfectly melty cheese.  The service was friendly and prompt with the drinks and quick to bus the tables.   There was truly nothing I would change about this place. I just loved it. I wish I could eat breakfast there every day.

Great New York-style pizza and enjoy the "secretive" aspect to the location. I love that about this place. I enjoyed a slice of meatball and mushroom while hubby had the meatball and pepperoni. Good size slices of pizza (not the obnoxious SBarros size-but a big enough size that one is enough) with a crunchy crust that I love. You can get a whole pizza if you want, but a slice is a great snack too! If you can find it, you won't regret it! :)

Anyone who follows my reviews knows that BBQ is not my favorite cuisine. That having been said, when we headed out to the Hog Trough Smokehouse to meet friends on Saturday, I was less than enthused but I suck it up in honor of my family. And honestly? I'm glad I did. This rustic little place in Wickenburg is a diamond in the...well...rougher?   Service was helpful, knowledgeable and patient with our larger group. Parking was at a premium as there was some sort of event in town but it worked out fine for us. This is a picnic tables, paper napkins, plastic wear, and styrofoam cup kind of place so don't expect fine dining here. Rustic food served in a rustic style place in a rustic style town? Sounds about right to me!  Pulled chicken is my go-to meal when I enjoy barbecue and was surprised to see the sauce served on the side! That's right--I got to add as much--or as little as I like! You actually get to enjoy the integrity of the meat versus guessing because it's over-sauced. The meat was not overly smoky, but had a nice smoke flavor to it. Imagine that...flavorful food! I enjoyed the potato salad and cornbread muffin with it. The sides are tasty and well seasoned. The bun for the sandwich was fresh and didn't overpower the sandwich either. I got to taste the coleslaw and the beans that my dining partners had and next time I will order the cole slaw as my side to go on top of the pulled chicken. I thought it might come that way but it didn't. That's ok...just gives me a reason to go back. And I will go back! How could I not? The food was plentiful, flavorful, and the servers knew what they were doing and how to talk about the food in their presentation!

What a fun, yet very noisy restaurant! Went last night with family and friends and I was surprised at how busy and NOISY it was for a Tuesday night.   Food was great. We enjoyed the pretzels and the zucchini fritters for an appetizer. The pretzels and cheese fondue were awesome...like I could take a bath in that cheese sauce kind of good. The zucchini fritters were just ok and the dipping sauce tasted too much like tartar sauce so it wasn't my fav. I enjoyed the scallops while the rest of my companions has the jambalaya and the pork carnitas. All were really tasty. The scallops were perfectly done and a good size. We also enjoyed the peanut butter chocolate gelati for dessert. It was superb.   Service was very good and prompt. Our drinks were kept full and I love that. This will definitely be in my arsenal of places to go downtown when I head there for events, but definitely keep in mind--it's NOISY.

Although this location does take walk-ins, it would behoove you to make an appointment if you would rather not spend an afternoon waiting. Lots of Sun City Westers come here so expect a wait if you didn't make an appointment.   The staff is nice. The front desk guy is a bit indifferent but I imagine I would be similar in stature if I had to deal with the elderly all day long. Not to say they don't deserve to be treated well, but I've seen them in action and they can be tiresome at best.   The phlebotomists are very proficient. My blood is not easy to draw yet they never have a problem. They are kind, professional, and make the process not so bad.   So what did we learn? Make an appointment, be patient with the oldsters, and the process isn't all that bad at this location! :)

A solid 4 star review on my first visit and I'm eager to come back and check out more items on the menu!  We were seated on the patio which is a large, spacious area. It was chilly last night but the patio was warm and inviting. The only draw-back is that it's...dark. Very dark. Had a hard time reading the menu much less seeing what they placed in front of us but the taste of the food was inviting enough for me to come back in the day-light to get the full effect.  We had the loaded chips to start. They are FANTASTIC. The housemade chips are perfectly crunchy and not greasy or oily at all. The carmelized onion, bacon, blue cheese, were all terrific. I am not sure if the chipotle crema was on there, I didn't taste it and had it been served in a better lit area, I'd know better if it was on there or not.  What I will say is that the loaded chips are a MUST HAVE appetizer because they were phenomenal.   My boy had the crab cake BLT for his main. It was very tasty, served on a roll with perfect fresh veggies. The crab cake was perfectly done...not too moist, not too bready. The french fries that he chose for the side dish were not anything special at all. They were typical shoestring fries that I'm pretty sure were frozen and weren't well seasoned at all. They had salt, but for a place that prides itself with fresh house-made food, I was surprised by the lack of creativity with the fries.  I had the soup and salad combo. The soup was a loaded potato soup which was pretty nice. The broth was nice. Nothing special, but had a nice velvety finish which I like. The bacon was yum but I think it might have been missing cheese or something. It just tasted like something was missing. I wish I could say what. I added pepper but that wasn't it. It was salty from the bacon but not overly so. The salad was the chopped salad which was tasty. The hard boiled egg was way way too salty though. The ranch dressing was nice though and the avocado was fresh and firm.   Our server was thorough but not terribly engaging. It's always been kind of hit or miss with the trendy servers at Postinos so I didn't expect Windsor to be much different. The decor is fun and I loved the wall of cassette tapes. Awesome conversation piece. Bathrooms are very similar to Postinos But unlike it's cousin, Windsor is not yet a 5-star place. It's got potential but it's not quite there. I'll definitely be back because they had a lot of very intriguing menu choices and those loaded chips are worth the price of admission all on its own.   Oh and one other note...like it's cousin, parking at Windsor is also a pain in the ass. Keep this in mind and definitely do the valet. It'll save you a lot of aggravation.

Chocolate cherry dipped cone? YES PLEASE! Well worth the trek out to Wickenburg from Surprise to this great little joint which is part of my past. Love Tastee Freez and love their soft serve. Friendly staff, clean restaurant and terrific dipped cones! Woth the drive!

Dear Churn, I love you. Peanut butter ice cream. Seriously? You had me at pretzel cone but peanut butter ice cream? How can a girl say no to that?  Super cute shop, friendly staff, and a speedy service line makes getting your ice cream craving cured pain free and fun.  Love all the knick knacks although the toys right at kid level were pretty devious of you.  But...peanut butter ice cream. Yeah. That makes it all better.

My son (AKA the 10 Year Old Gourmand) and I enjoyed lunch here today and enjoyed it thoroughly! We were pleasantly surprised by the trendy, upscale decor that was without a hint of tacky typical Asian restaurant flair. The room was open and bright and not a hint of fushia in sight. :)   We enjoyed the pork eggrolls as our appetizer. They came out piping hot with an accompaniment of mint leaves and lettuce to roll the egg rolls in. The viniagrette dipping sauce was sweet without taking away from the flavor of the egg rolls. Probably the best egg rolls we've had in quite a long time.  I enjoyed the Meatball Pho for my entree. I enjoy Pho very much and this was excellent. I was told by our server that they steep the broth for over 10 hours and it was very nicely done. I ordered a small serving which I couldn't finish but not because it wasn't amazing. I just got full. :)  My son had the shrimp fried rice. It had a very generous portion of shrimp in it...and not diced up and spread throughout...these were larger size shrimp with the tails still on. I counted at least 8 shrimp which is a pretty generous portion. The rice was perfectly cooked and while it could easily have fed us both, my son gobbled it up like it was his last meal. It came with a side of scallion soup which was also delicious  as well.   The service was attentive while not being intrusive and they were kind enough to explain about the side dish of condiments for the Pho to ensure that even the most novice of Pho-eaters were sure to find a way to make their Pho exactly how they like it.   All in all, an excellent new restaurant hidden among the chains that surround this area of Bell rd and a new treasure to Surprise. Can't wait to go back!

We've been here 3 more times since my last review and each time has been as good as our first visit.   My son is addicted to the shrimp fried rice. And I can see why! It is flavorful and the portion of shrimp was and continues to be very generous.  At our last visit, my husband and I shared the Saigon fried rice which was very good as well. The one thing that I noticed, and it's only because I'm a culinary school grad, is that the cuts of meats in the rice weren't uniform. It had sausage, pork, shrimp, chicken, etc in it and the meats were all different sizes. It's not an issue but from a culinary standpoint...I'm a snob in that way. hahaha.  The drinks are always full, the service is always attentive, and they are always very happy to have us back! Looking forward to our next visit as those darn pork eggrolls are addictive!

As always, a 5 star visit to Saigon Kitchen. Stopped in today for lunch to celebrate my son's last day of school. We enjoyed the egg rolls as usual. I had the vegetarian pho, he had the Saigon fried rice and our companion had the filet mignon salad. All were delicious, served at the right temperatures, and our drinks were kept full.   We got to Saigon Kitchen at least once a month and every time is a great experience. From the friendly hostess to the attentive server, and even the bus person is helpful and kind, we always have a memorable experience.

Dear Egg Rolls, how I do love you here at Saigon Kitchen. You are delicate, flavorful, and SUPER HOT. It's hard for me to wait when you come out of the kitchen but I MUST because you burn the crap out of my mouth otherwise. :) Love wrapping you up in a leaf of lettuce and mint leaves. Love dipping you in the wonderful sauce. You complete me......  We also enjoyed the vegetarian pho today and my son had the filet mignon beef stew. The meat in the stew was so tender it just fell apart. It was perfectly delish. The pho is what you make it to be! Add the fixings and make it what you want it to be and stop complaining about it being bland. It's SUPPOSED TO BE!

So, we went back to SUL recently to see Jim Breuer and man does he put on a great show! If you get the chance to see him--GO. He was 5 stars all the way.  Now, as for SUL, well the same issues I had the first visit were even more evident the 2nd visit. Service still continues at FULL THROTTLE through the entire headlining act. It was a CONSTANT barrage of servers walking in front of us the entire show. It was rude, it was distracting, and frankly, I don't know if I'll go back knowing that for the ENTIRE SHOW, I will have someone walking in front of me. Please--that was one of the best things about Improv--the suspension of service during the headliner so that you can actually see, pay attention to, and be entertained because thats what we paid to see!   Our server tried to pull the same trick with the souvenir glasses as last time but we told him after he brought our drinks out the first time that that's not what we ordered and we aren't paying for them. He changed them out without much fuss because he could see we meant business but still. That's not good business.   I want to like Stand Up Live and I know there will be acts that I want to see, but I'll be honest, I will truly hesitate if that show is at SUL.

Chris did an outstanding job for our convention reception last year. I feel remiss that I didn't provide a review at that time, but Chris was outstanding. His equipment was even better than the hotel's! We were very impressed with his professionalism, his willingness to work with our group's funky scheduling, and his patience with our audience. We highly recommend Chris and hope you will book him for your next event!

What a fun place--and right next door to Stand Up Live! 80+Beers on tap, great food, excellent service. I couldn't have asked for a nicer visit!  Crowded but not overly so, food served hot, beer served ice cold. Can't wait to go back!

Simple concept taken to a whole new level. Creative burgers, delicious varieties of fries, and one of the best milkshakes I've had in a long time. I had the Beach House burger which is a burger with Roasted green chili, smoked mozzarella, pico de gallo. It was outstanding. A friend had the Br√ªl√©e burger which is Fried egg, bacon, onion, burnt sugar, havarti. It was heavenly. My husband had Paradise burger which is 2‚Äã beef patties beer battered and fried, smothered with a green chili/vodka/bacon cream sauce. Topped off with smoked fresno chilis pickled in whiskey! It was amazing. We had the sweet potato tater tots, the french toast fries (which really should be on the dessert menu) and the carnival corn. It was all really good.   The place is small so be prepared to wait for a seat. Everything is made to order so don't go if you are in a hurry. This place is meant for slow enjoyment. We will definitely be back to try more things on the menu!

The gourmet son and I have been here several times since school started and each time the yogurt is fresh and delicious. The decor is retro and fun with 3 televisions showing old tv shows or movies. Once we even got to watch an old episode of Ozzie and Harriet. The store is clean, the staff is friendly and helpful, and I like their frequent visitor plan--instead of having to keep track of a card that gets punched, they have your phone number logged into their computer and add points to your account. Get 500 points and you get a free yogurt! Not too shabby!   Plus for those of you who need fundraisers, Cruisin also offers fun fundraisers as well!

Visited here during a convention in Charlotte by recommendation from the hubby and man--this was some good grub! We went with a party of 10 and they were more than accommodating. I wish we had such a concept here in PHX!  So many choices and options even for the most picky of palates. The food was cooked to order--which I love. The salads were fresh and tasty.  But like my hubby--I wish there was beverage service because it is a bit awkward to have to leave the table when dining with associates to refill a drink. This isn't McDonalds....  I do look forward to coming back during my next trip to Charlotte though!

Have had many good experiences here at SAH. I just wish that veterinary care wasn't such an expensive undertaking. It's really kind of ridiculous that it costs nearly $100 for a 7 minute vet visit every year. The vet techs could really give the shots and save customers a bunch of money but I digress.  The standard of care is very professional, friendly, and pleasant. They are very accommodating to my dog who doesn't like other cats or dogs so they work around his needs. They were very caring with my previous dog who had to be put down. I'm sorry to the previous person who had a bad experience with having their dog put down there. Believe me, that is not a normal circumstance at SAH.

VERY impressed with this little gem of a barbershop!   Friendly and very experienced staff in the cleanest barbershop I've ever been in. The staff has done a first-rate job on my boys' hair every time they've gone in. Even my baby gets a super haircut to the point where I have no idea how they could have done so well as he's pretty squirmy! He always looks sharp!   Highly recommend this shop!

It's Coco's--how special can it be? Well believe it or not, we had an exceptional visit to this location to celebrate a birthday in our family. My inlaws don't like to leave the perimeter of Sun City West/Grand so we are limited in our selection of restaurants. And this location has been a lot of different restaurants in the past, but I think it will see success as a Coco's. The service was excellent, our food was served at the right temperatures and the wait was minimal at best.   We look forward to going back--which is tough to say with a Sun City restaurant but this Coco's has earned another try! :)

Very impressed with this fun place at Arrowhead! Food was yum, service was pretty good! We were initially seated inside but it was such a nice night that we asked to be moved outside to the patio--NO PROBLEM! We got in a corner booth and it was perfect.   The only thing that keeps me from giving this 5 stars is that for those of us not imbibing in alcohol...we had to BEG for refills. And those were sparse at best. Hate that. :(  But, the food was quite yum. We had Fish and Chips, Shepherd's Pie, and Bangers and Mash. We also had the Corned Beef Nachos as a starter. All dishes were piping hot and very well seasoned without being over powering. I had the small portion of the Shepherd's Pie and it was just the right size. The side of veg on all of our dishes was sparse at best and very oily...and kind of an after thought but so be it. We also enjoyed the bread pudding, red velvet cake, and apple cake for dessert. The apple dessert really needed ice cream but was otherwise pretty good. The bread pudding was wonderful--not overly mushy. I'm not a red velvet fan but this one was moist and the frosting was super YUM!   All in all a good visit and I look forward to going back soon!

Frankly, I was frightened to eat here...but my inlaws really wanted to try it and because I prefer to keep the peace in terms of family relationships, I sucked it up and kept my trap shut. Luckily, my husband reminded my FIL about the recent health department visit where the German cockroach fell on the head of the inspector but it wasn't until after my FIL mentioned how clean the place seemed compared to the other Chinese place....  Ok, so our visit was ok. The restaurant was clean, the line was clean, and the staff kept the tables well bussed. The food was EXACTLY THE SAME as the China Buffet over on Litchfield and Bell though. In fact, pretty sure they are the same business because the food was identical in presentation and flavor. The difference with this location is that they have Mongolian BBQ. Well, at least they have a Mongolian BBQ station. It's unmanned. I waited for someone to come...even asked for someone to come...was told it would be "just a minute" but no one ever came. Oh well. It's not like I'm coming back.   It would be great to have a Chinese restaurant that is outside the box here in Surprise, but I won't hold my breath.

Enjoyed lunch here recently with 3 friends. The restaurant itself is beautiful--clean, open, and somewhat reminiscent of a NY style deli in the sense that you order at the counter and they bring it out to you. It would probably be a good idea if there is an "Order Here" sign to let people know that as it is a tiny bit confusing if people aren't used to the NY Deli way.   LOVE the big screen with the live feed from Times Square. Great conversation piece!  One word to describe the food is FRESH. Everything is made to order and is clearly made on-site which is a nice change.   I had the Herald Square sandwich with a side of pasta salad. The bread was very fresh and the meat was sliced fresh when I placed my order. The cranberry sauce was very tasty and the greens on the salad were a nice addition. The pasta salad was well done, I just wish there was more of it than the little portion cup size!   My friend had the Italian sandwich which was on ciabatta. It had a nice sauce on it and she had the potato salad which she felt needed salt. It was a dill style potato salad and wasn't overly mayonaisse-y.  Other friend had a Chef Salad which was made to order with his choice of dressing. They had house made italian dressing which was nice.  Third friend had a coney island hot dog. It didn't look to be anything special but he said it was one of the better Coney's he's had in a while! He also had fries which were hot, perfectly salty, and again, house-made. Love that.  Two of us also had cheesecake which was quite tasty.   Prices were reasonable and the portions weren't too big or too small. Overall, a nice addition to Surprise and the small crop of local owners that are springing up.   Looking forward to going back soon!

I have now enjoyed several meals including breakfast and dinner at NY Flavor and each time gets better and better. I'm not ready to give them 5 stars, but the food is really very good and the service is getting there.   I recently enjoyed an egg white omelet with vegetables, potatoes and toast. It was very good. They were out of fruit cups so I had watermelon which was just in season. The eggs were perfectly done and the potatoes were quite nice. The toast was unbuttered, which is good for me but they could have put some butter or something on the side so you didn't just have dry toast. That's ok. They are still learning.  I also had a basil marscapone burger on another visit. It was quite delicious. The carmelized onions on top really added a nice sweetness and the bun was perfectly paired. I like my burgers cooked medium and this was perfectly done.  As mentioned, everything is made to order and is wonderfully fresh! :) I love that.   I do need to expand my repetoire of sides as I really do love the potato salad. Perhaps on another visit...perhaps even sometime this week. :)

We've become such regulars here and it's nice that our business is appreciated.   We came tonight with my inlaws who we introduced to the deli about 2 weeks ago. They've been here 4 times since I first brought them. HA! :)   And with coming here so frequently, I've challenged my son to try something new every time we come but he loves the Nautilus sandwich the best. So I tried the 34th Street sandwich. O.M.G. It's a turkey sandwich with brie, watercress, and poached pears with honey mustard on a kaiser roll. It was hands down the best sandwich I have ever had. Ever. Ever ever. My son tried to steal the other half from me and I almost stabbed him with my fork. Ok not really but he did try to steal the other 1/2. My father in law had the Philly Cheesesteak or as they call it ?*illy Cheesesteak. :) He really enjoyed it. So much so that he wouldn't share a bite! :) My mother in law had the Herald's Square. It's her favorite. I had it the first time I came here. It's turkey with cranberry on 9 grain. It's an excellent sandwich. The cranberry sauce isn't overwhelming at all and the turkey is fresh sliced. My mother in law and I also shared a piece of chocolate cake and it was moist, fresh, and oh so chocolatey. You could tell it was house-made. My son had his favorite cheesecake. Just love that cheesecake.  The staff here is so friendly, whether you are a regular or not. They have really gone above and beyond to make people feel welcome and they've done well at explaining to people how to order.   Looking forward to our next visit!

Just when I thought I couldn't love NY Flavor any more than I already do, Bill and Lynn along with Chef Craig top themselves again. Now they are offering a 10% discount to anyone who shows their PTA Membership card. So not only do they make delicious foods at decent prices and are the friendliest, cleanest restaurant in Surprise, they are embracing the community to help out our schools, parents, and kids by joining the ranks of the largest child advocacy organization in the country! What's not to love about this place???

Came in for dinner tonight and had decided before I got there that I was going to try the veggie burger after reading so many rave reviews about it in the newspaper reviews recently. Now I am not a veggie burger kind of girl nor am I much on beef either--I'm that weirdo turkey burger kind. This veggie burger was EXCELLENT and I would have it again in a heartbeat. The outside edges were a bit on the crispy side but the center was moist and delicious.   My son enjoyed the ?illy cheesesteak which was outstanding...and my friend enjoyed the marscapone burger which is always out of this world. Both enjoyed the crispy fries while I had my tried and true potato salad. I kind of wish they would try out macaroni salad for a little while but maybe I'll suggest it to Chef next time I'm in. We'll see.  Friendly staff, clean establishment, and have really grown to love eating here!  Plus--enjoyed my 10% PTA discount. Can't beat that!

Because I've changed my eating habits and have successfully lost quite a bit of weight, I try to eat light for my mid-day meal. Today was an exception as Chef Craig wanted us to try out two special burgers...the Hawaiian burger and the Brie burger. My husband was able to try the Hawaiian last week, but this was my big chance and it did not disappoint.   The Hawaiian is 100% angus beef (I get the 1/3lb burger) topped with delicious ham, melted swiss, avocado slices, thin sliced onion, tomato, mayo and crushed pineapple. I'm going to coin a 90's phrase that I feel is appropriate to describe this burger....orgasmic. Honestly. I felt the earth move when I bit into this burger. The creamy texture of the avocado paired so nicely with the sweetness of the pineapple. The saltiness of the ham was just right. It was sheer perfection between a sliced bun!   The Brie burger is also 100% angus beef topped with thin sliced onion, tomato, sauteed mushrooms, and a slice of brie cheese. It is also amazing as well. The creamy yet tart flavor of the brie really lent itself nicely to the angus meat and even though my son likes his burgers grilled well done, it was still juicy and flavorful.   I can't speak highly enough about NY Flavor. I can't wait to go back later this week to try something new!

As always, great visits to NY Flavor; wonderful hospitality, delicious, housemade recipes, and I can't seem to get enough. This review is on the Spanish Harlem and the Reuben sandwiches which I enjoyed this past week.   The Spanish Harlem is a seasoned steak sandwich with fresh made chimichurri spread, tomatoes, red onions on a baguette. When you read this you think that this sandwich might have some kick to it. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Chef had to tone down the spiciness of this sandwich based on demand from the public. For me, this is a shame. When I see chimichurri spread, I'm thinking spicy and I want spicy. Don't get me wrong, this is a very flavorful sandwich. The steak is nicely seasoned and tender. The chimichurri spread, although not spicy, is a nice change to the standard mayonnaise spread you might get at other places. The veggies are fresh and crisp and the baguette has a nice outer crunch with a soft inside. I was just disappointed that this sandwich wasn't spicy. I could have asked for hot sauce or something to kick it up, but it is what it is. This sandwich gets 4 stars.   The Reuben sandwich is one of my all-time favorite hot sandwiches. It is very important to me that it's done right and NYF does it right. What I also like about this is that they ask you if you want it made with 1000 island or with mustard. They also ask if you want it toasted or not. I am a corned beef girl with swiss, saurkraut, 1000 island on marble bread girl. That seems pretty standard to me and the way I've always had it but I appreciate that they are willing to make it to the taste of other lesser-known cultures who do it different. ;) The marble bread was fresh and perfectly toasty. It didn't get soggy either from the spread which can happen but perhaps it's because when I didn't give it time to get soggy either. The corned beef was spot on. It was fresh sliced, tender, and just the right amount of hot to get the swiss all melty and take the edge off the saurkraut. This was a 5 star Reuben all the way.   So as I continue my journey through the menu at NYF, I still can't recommend enough your taking the time to come by and visit this little gem in Surprise. I LOVE locally owned businesses and I'm THRILLED that I can continue to give this place high marks. :)

It's time for my monthly NY Flavor update. I don't know if I could honestly admit how many times I've been here since my last review, but it's easily twice a week. I've enjoyed breakfast, lunch, and dinner here multiple times over. The staff is friendly, kind, and great stewards of the community. Saw them recently at a fundraiser to help build a local skate park making hot dogs! Yum!  So, since my last update, I've enjoyed the veggie burger, Gramercy park breakfast sandwich, the South street. the lasagna. The veggie burger is truly amazing. I never in my life thought I would like a veggie burger but I absolutely LOVE this veggie burger--to the point of craving it! The house made black bean patty is mixed with beets, carrots, and some other stuff that is just downright delish. The Gramercy Park breakfast sandwich is eggwhites, turkey, and cheese on a kaiser roll. What's not to love about that? The South Street is a grilled chicken breast sandwich with corn relish and the usual set up of lettuce, tomato, and onion. I am not typically a fan of chicken sandwiches. Usually you end up with a rubbery hint of a chicken breast. This chicken breast is grilled perfectly--it's juicy, flavorful, and it fits the kaiser roll properly rather than just being a big dump of chicken between a bun. Finally, the lasagna. This is a meatless lasagna that truthfully, I was skeptical about. I make excellent lasagna and always have put ground beef and ground sausage and get rave reviews for years on it. This lasagna is better than mine. And it's meatless. And honestly--you don't miss the meat at all. Now if you have to have the meat, you can get meatballs and sausage on the side. But try it without first and see for yourself. It's absolutely amazing.   Now, since my last update, NY Flavor has done a few changes to the menu. They've added fresh fruit cups, you can also add a side salad (for $2 more) to any dish, and you can get a 1/2 sandwich with soup OR salad. And you can pick ANY sandwich on the menu to get 1/2 size. The soup is excellent. I had the tomato and roasted red pepper bisque. It was wonderful.   NY Flavor is going to be implementing some daily specials during the Olympics so make sure you stop in! And if you haven't become a PTA member yet, you really need to find a local school or contact me and I can help you join so you can get your 10% discount at NY Flavor for being a membership!

Updating my review with feedback on a few menu items that are new to me or have been improved upon since my last review. I should also mention that NYF now serves beer and wine! They have a great selection of bottled brews and several wines to accompany your meal or even stop in for Happy Hour from 4-6PM Monday-Friday!   Let's start with the Spanish Harlem as it has been perfected. In one of my previous reviews, I mentioned that it was just missing something kicky to really make the sandwich pop. Well, NYF found it. Chef Craig changed the bread to a wonderful jalapeno fiocaccia and it is now PERFECT and absolutely a 5-Star sandwich. The jalapeno fiocaccia is fresh, not too crunchy, not too doughy, and just the right amount of heat without overpowering the whole thing. If you are looking for a sandwich with a kick to it, enjoy the Spanish Harlem.   Now, working my way through the menu, I've tried the following new-to-me items that are really notable. The Tribecca sandwich is a roast beef sandwich with carmelized onion and an amazing horseradish spread that is really remarkable. I am not a big roast beef fan as it tends to be kind of chewy and just isn't my favorite. This roast beef is tender, not chewy, not stringy, and is not too rare like it can be sometimes. This is served on a ciabatta that is also not too crunchy, not too doughy. The horseradish spread accompanied with the carmelized onions...now that is what sets this sandwich apart. The horseradish spread is not too horsey and the carmelized onions gives it a nice sweetness that offsets the spread's tang to make a marriage of flavors that is unforgettable. This is quickly becoming my new favorite sandwich.  And now the salads. Usually I build my own but this time I decided to trust the chef and I tried the Southwest Caesar. The standout in this salad is the chipotle caesar dressing. What an incredible tang without being overly heated. The flavors just dance off of your tongue and the flavors in the salad pair so well with the dressing. The crunchy romain coupled with red onion, grape tomatoes, real bacon, fresh corn, real parmesan cheese and toasty croutons make this salad something special.   If you haven't been in to NYF yet, please stop in and actually EAT the food. You'll be pleased with how good real cooking can be!

My name is Beth S and I am addicted to NY Flavor. That having been said, this is a review on the 2 recent catering gigs that I hired them to perform for me.   First job was a dinner for the teachers at our school. We ordered spaghetti with salad and bread. It was BEYOND expectation. The sauce was awesome, the salad was beautifully done and the bread was still warm upon delivery! The teachers raved!  The 2nd job was for my son's birthday party this past weekend. We ordered sandwich trays of all his favorites and not only were the sandwiches perfect but they were beautifully displayed and not just tossed on some sandwich plate. The salads were plentiful and delicious. Our guests were BLOWN AWAY about how delicious and well done the catering was and I am so glad we hired them to make my son's day special.   Bill, Lynn, Chef Craig and staff are terrific. I continue to be impressed with their professionalism as well as how they treat everyone who walks in the door-whether it was the first time or the 80th time-like family. So lucky to have this small business in Surprise. :)

Yeah, so I'm a regular here at the restaurant and having tried most of the offerings on the menu, I was so pleased to be greeted with a SPECIAL today--PULLED PORK SANDWICH! Now, those of you who follow my reviews know I am not a real big BBQ fan. I tag along with husband and son who love it when they are in the mood for BBQ but it's just not my favorite cuisine. In addition to the pulled pork special, the soup of the day was roasted corn and poblano chili chowder. O.M.G  Let's talk about the chowder first. I am a HUGE soup fan. I gauge the quality of a good chef by their soup. Chef Craig has a real winner with this one. It's got just enough texture to be chowder-ific but it's got a nice velvety smoothness to it that you aren't expecting. The poblanos add just enough heat to give you that little OOOH when you taste it but not so much to turn you off entirely to the soup. And don't take my word for it...the next 4 people after us ordered the chowder and while we were there, at least 3 people came in to order quart size take-out versions of it! This soup was truly a religious experience so much that I may have seen Jesus while eating it. Can I get a Yum Yum from the congregation?   And now the pulled pork special. The pulled pork absolutely melted in my mouth. The housemade honey bbq sauce was just the right amount of sweet and tang to compliment the pork and not overpower it. The coleslaw on top added a perfect amount of crunch served on a buttery sandwich roll that is light, flaky, and oh so yum. You can get your choice of side and hubby, son, and I each had something a little different. Son had the coleslaw on the side, hubby had the pasta salad and I had a side salad. My son called the sandwich "sublime". I didn't even know my 12 year old had that $5 word in his arsenal! Hubby was so quiet that I couldn't gauge what he was thinking until he smiled that blissfully satisfied smile when he finished that I knew, this was a sandwich among sandwiches. He promptly called Bill, the owner, over and shared his rave reviews.    As always, the service is friendly, prompt, and makes you feel right at home. Everything here is made to order and the joint is jumping with Spring Training happening right around the corner at Surprise Stadium so expect a crowd when you come. Quality food takes time--and this place is worth the wait!

Although I'm  big fan of the Southwest Caesar salad as it is my go-to lunch here at NYF, I tried the NYPD burger today. Your choice of 1/3 or 1/2 lb burger on that buttery bun with the smokiest blue cheese crumbles I've ever had. It was delicious! I love that everything here is made to order and to your specifications. I love that the staff is friendly, courteous, and go above and beyond to make your meal special. The new menu boards are up as well and they look fantastic!   Plus--did you know about the kids' menu? Yep--NYF now has kids options as well! From kid faves like Mac N Cheese to hot dogs, sliders to chicken fingers, this menu offers some great kid size choices for even your finickiest little New Yorker.   Oh and if you follow them on Facebook, they will run Facebook specials from time to time to keep things interesting.   All in all, a very fun mom-n-pop restaurant tucked in to Surprise that you don't want to skip!

Now serving cod cakes on Friday night...ok you had me at hello! You get 2 pan fried hand made cod cakes, coupled with the awesome fresh cut fries and house made cole slaw partnered with some super yum tartar sauce for $9.99 is just about as close to heaven as you can get. This is a special though for the month of June so come in while it lasts.   The cod cakes are panko crusted with fresh cod inside and are just about as tender and flaky as you could possibly want. The fresh cut fries are crisp, hot, and perfectly seasoned. The coleslaw is not too saucy which I like.   Of course all the other standard menu items are available too--even breakfast--so there's something for everyone!   Oh and if you haven't tried NYF yet and want to--go on Monday from 4-close as you'll get 20% off your entire bill during the month of June!

After eating lunch here 3-5 times a week for the past 2 years, breakfast nearly every Saturday, brunch on Sundays, and had MANY events catered, I have NEVER had a bad meal or seen a customer mistreated. The staff here at NYF is second to none in ensuring your food is made to your taste and satisfaction. While I have seen some cranky seniors...and that's not unusual at certain times of the year, I have never once seen a staffer here lose their cool or not take care of a customer in a manner that I would describe as far above and beyond. Bill and Lynn make sure that every customer feels like family. Chef Craig comes up with inspired, creative, innovative specials to keep frequent diners from getting bored. If anyone had a bad experience here, I guarantee Bill, Lynn, and Chef Craig will make it right IF given the chance. It would appear that one reviewer on here recently has a vendetta or maybe his undies are too tight. Hard to tell...but I can guarantee after my MANY visits, I've never seen ANYONE go away upset if they took the time to mention their issue. Oh and by the way--no one who works there has blonde hair. So take that for what it's worth--Just sayin'.   There are so many great things on the menu but my go-to is the Southwest Caesar salad. I add avocado to it to pack a punch but the different textures and flavors in this salad alone always leaves me wanting more.  It is fresh made with romaine, grape tomatoes, parmesan, real bacon bits, red onions, cilantro, fresh corn, croutons, and a southwest caesar dressing that is a spicy kiss to top off the meal. I get mine with grilled chicken too that is juicy and YUM.  Today I enjoyed a chicken Spanish Harlem and it was perfection between two pieces of jalape√±o ciabatta. The french fries are heavenly and FRESH CUT to boot! My boys enjoyed the pulled pork special, but last week the Italian Beef was on special which was amazing too. Their kids menu is fun as well and kids do eat free on Wednesdays! My littlest guy loves the junior sliders and today had the pee wee pasta. Breakfast is excellent as well. The pancakes are SUPER. The portions are good size--not oversized; rather they are APPROPRIATE size.   NYF goes above and beyond to help the community too! From offering restaurant nights to PTA/PTOS, to mentoring DECA students at Willow Canyon to catering lunches for Surprise Chamber of Commerce events to dinners for tennis tourneys, to teacher appreciation breakfasts to providing dinner for the local Relay for Life events, the amount of love they give back to the community is just awesome. This is a local business that deserves the accolades it has won by being named NW Region Chamber of Commerce local small business of the year.

Can't believe it's been over a year since I last updated my review about NYF. For as long as I've been coming here, it's been a five star experience. The staff; Craig, Stephanie, Ginger, Kenny, Jarid and Alex are all exceptional. The owner, Bill, is always helpful and nice. The kids doing prep work in the back are friendly and polite. You will never see a staff member lose their cool; even during the busiest of times.   You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The specials are unique, innovative and delicious. Lynn's desserts are delicious. The classics are always done to perfection. The hand-cut french fries are the best in town.  Whether you are looking for something lite like the Southwest Caesar or you're going full-scale with a DeNiro Burger and everything in between--there is something for everyone here. They even have gluten free bread!   Baseball season is coming up and the restaurant does get busy so keep in mind that everything is made fresh to order. Fresh to order means that you might have to wait a tad longer than those assembly line fast food crappy places. It's so worth it though. Believe me.   Just can't say enough about how much I love NYF and how glad I am that it's a staple in my family's life. We are able to enjoy so many family meals here together.

I have given them fair chances and have never been impressed. The food is heat and serve with nothing that really stands out. It's adequate enough...but nothing special.  Wait times for food can be hit or miss with no rhyme or reason.   The problem at Jim's is the counter service. The woman who works at the counter is about as rude as it gets. It almost feels like we were supposed to thank HER instead of her thanking customers for coming in. I don't know why she still works here; I have to assume she's an owner or really good friends with the owners because her continued employment is a mystery to me. Twice while we were there, cooks quit in the middle of their shift after having what seemed to be a good argument with her.   There are better places in Surprise. Don't settle for crappy service.

Great spot to hit up before or after the game and save some money over those pricey concessions in the process! Friendly staff, very clean restaurant, and the same deliciousness that can be found at all the other Chipotles'. Definitely will make a point to go back for a quick, easy, inexpensive meal again next time I'm downtown!

I have been a patient of the Center for Venous Disease for years now and am very happy with not only the service I receive from Dr. David Smith, but the staff is also EXCELLENT. Unfortunately, I have yucky old lady varicose veins and although Dr. Smith did fix them beautifully 6 years ago, I had a recurrence or shall I say a mutany happen when I was pregnant with my 2nd child last summer. I have had a combination of vein stripping and foam and have had excellent results. Dr. Smith is gentle, kind, and informs you of every step he is taking the entire process. The staff is friendly, courteous, and treats you like family.   As a side note, varicose vein procedures are often covered by insurance so check with yours as it is often not cosmetic reasons behind having the procedure done or why you have the veins in the first place. You don't have to live with the heavy, itchy, painful, nasty looking snakes on your legs anymore! Check into it and check into Dr. Smith because he really is a miracle worker! You'd never know I had nasty varicose veins before his work on my legs.

A great addition to the Surprise area! The staff is great--polite, friendly, and they get the sandwiches done right the first time. I've used them twice for catering purposes and they were on the money! They even helped me carry my sandwiches out to the car! I gladly drive by 2 other Subways just to go to this store.

Our party of 6 stopped by tonight for dinner. Apparently the intended clientle is the over 65 crowd and although my 11 year old and 9 month old were treated kindly, I found it a bit off putting to have one of the staff sweep the floor for the 5 baby snacks my baby dropped under his high chair before we've even been served dinner. Seriously...5 crunchies. And I would have picked them up myself before we left but apparently they were bothering someone enough that she had to drag out the broom and dust pan and make a scene about sweeping them up.   From the get-go our server seemed disinterested in us. Audrey N was our server and although she never did introduce herself, her name is printed on my tab so I'm assuming that's her name. Our drinks were not just empty, they were bone dry unless we specifically asked for a refill. There is no bread service...at least not any that we received so it was a long wait between the time we ordered and when we got our meals...especially when our drinks were empty in the process. Evidently there were dinner specials that we only found out about after we placed our order and only because we heard her sharing them with the table next to us. She never offered appetizers which we might have been talked in to but alas, that's an upsell that she won't get. And we really threw her off when my husband asked her to describe the meatloaf dinner. He was intending to find out about whether the meatloaf had gravy on it and how it was served (sliced, a mini loaf, etc) but his question really threw Audrey for a loop as she had no idea how to describe how the meatloaf was served. She never checked on us during the course of our meal though she was quite attentive to the over 65 table of 4 next to us. Finally, we would have liked to try the dessert, but Audrey unceremoniously dropped off our check without so much as a mention of dessert. Again, another upsell that she missed out on. Believe me, I really tried to keep an open mind about this place, but Audrey brought any sense of positive energy to a grinding halt.  The food was....confusing. The reason for my confusion is that the food, although all distributed on the same plate, was all different temperature ranges. I ordered the pot roast with mashed potatoes and mixed veggies. The food was all different temps and even within the individual items, there were varying degrees of temperature as well....none of which would I describe as h-o-t. It was more like luke warm, cold, and stone cold. Further, the portion was adequate if you don't mind 1 cup of mashed potatoes, 1 cup of veggies to about a 2 oz portion of pot roast meat. The price seems satisfactory enough but if I'm only getting 2 oz of meat, it's out of balance. The little bit of pot roast I did have seemed tender and flavorful though and the mashed potatoes were seasoned nicely. The veggies were varying degrees of doneness with the broccoli undercooked and the squash a mushy mess.   My husband did get the meatloaf and it wasn't drowning in gravy which was good, but he also experienced the varying temperature degrees as well. His meatloaf went from slightly warm on the edges to ice cold in the center. His potatoes were stone cold.   My son and another guest had burgers which they enjoyed, but the "freedom fries" were basically frozen fries so they were uninteresting and soggy at best. Our final guest ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich which wasn't terribly buffalo'd in flavor and had the same frozen fries to accompany them.   The lone stand out was the absolutely delicious sweet potato/jalapeno soup that I had with my dinner. It was fantastic albeit luke warm.   If I could offer any piece of advice it would be to make sure you treat ALL of your customers professionally and kindly because once those snowbirds go home, you're stuck with the families who actually reside in the area and when you haven't treated us right, we aren't going to pick your place to come back to visit. Work on your serving temperatures and timing so that hot food comes out HOT and train Audrey. Seriously. Oh and the pictures hung in the dining room that are for sale that feature women in bikini tops? Tuh, ack, eey and distasteful at best.

We went on May 9 and had a pretty nice experience. I'm not sure what's with all of the 2 star ratings because honestly, this place was much better than I was expecting and for those who read my reviews, I have pretty high expectations.   What was good: They offer school fundraisers. This is why we happened to go that night and they donate back 15% to schools. That's a big plus for me.  Although the menu was nothing overly specia, there is a wide selection of items so even if you are watching your weight (as I am), you can make healthy choices without being relegated to the salad section. And the food was tastier than I was expecting. My friend had a Cuban Sandwich and said it was pretty good. The bread was fresh and the meats were plentiful and tasty. My son had fish and chips. The fish was a little greasy, but overall, it was very tasty. We had to ask for tartar sauce and it didn't come with the malt vinegar but I suspect that if we asked, we'd have gotten it. I had a veggie wrap which was brown rice with a variety of mixed veggies with some kind of sauce wrapped in a very large tortilla. It was pretty darn tasty.  My friend and I both had broccoli on the side which was overcooked, but it was nice to have that as an option in a sports bar setting all things considered. We also had a steak quesadilla to start and the steak was VERY flavorful and nicely done.    Our server was SUPER nice and although she made a few mistakes, she took ownership and rectified the problems promptly. For example, she brought us steak nachos when we ordered the steak quesadilla. She apologized, took ownership rather than doing the "blame the kitchen" routine, and quickly brought us a new appetizer. She was a little slow on keeping the drinks filled but it was busy so we'll cut her some slack.   What I didn't like:  Thinking back, there wasn't much I didn't like. The food was flavorful, the service was nice, though slow, and the place was nicely lit, open, and inviting. I'd definitely go back for a girls night out situation or at least an adults night out. I guess the one thing I'd have to question is whether or not it's a sports bar or a family restaurant with a sports theme. It's hard to decipher. I guess that would explain some of the other reviews complaining about the lighting and the ambiance because it is hard to determine which theme the restaurant is going for. They do Kids Eat Free on Tuesday nights....so if it's a sports bar...you don't really want kids there. I don't know. I'm rambling.  Here's the bottom line....give it an honest, open minded try. If you don't like it, blame me. If you do like it, blame me. :)

Spacious, friendly, and comfy--those are all great attributes to a decent club room. Great selection of snacks, lots of outlets for charging various batteries, nice quiet rooms for phone calls...also a bonus. The nicest part was the really friendly staff...which is unusual for US Airways, but a refreshing change. If you have to hit up a club room, this won't be a disappointment.

There is nothing more that I love than a locally owned family operated business.  I love being able to use the drive thru here and am always pleasantly pleased by how fresh tasting and delicious the coffee is. We enjoyed the fresh muffins today (orange cranberry and dutch apple) which were completely ah-maz-ing. From the chai tea to the mochas, to the lattes...you won't be disappointed at Sunsational.

Unique and fun new place in Scottsdale! Took the whole family recently and there was something for everyone! There are actually 2 separate buildings to Brat Haus. One side is clearly "the bar" and the other side is more geared toward those (like us) who come with kids!   There was an outstanding selection of beers from all shapes, sizes, and thicknesses. There was also an outstanding selection of uniquely flavored soda pops for the kids too! We enjoyed pretzels fundido and the Belgian fries for appetizer. Although the pretzels were a bit overdone and fundido was a bit blah, the Belgian fries were DELISH and plentiful. The dipping sauces were excellent and more than made up for the lack-luster pretzel appetizer.  I enjoyed the Spicy Brat with the Apricot chutney and it was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy. My son and his friend enjoyed standard beer brats with mustard and saurkraut. They LOVED them. My husband enjoyed the specialty pork brat and was very pleased with it as well.   I'm looking forward to going back for a grown-ups night out there soon as I'm sure it's way more fun for the adults though I am happy that it was kid-friendly as well! Well worth the 40 minute drive from our house and looking forward to going back soon!

Our group recently held a bowling tournament at Uptown Alley in the hopes of not just raising funds for scholarships for students in our district, but also to spread some community spirit by supporting a new(er) local business. This review is based on our entire experience.  First of all, Uptown Alley does not really give you any breaks for a group event--not even if you are 501(c)(3) or raising funds for a good cause which they knew was our purpose. They charged us $2 each for shoes and  $15/hr per lane (we had 20 lanes reserved). So essentially, we would have to raise at least $1000 just to break even. We were told they would open up early for us at 8AM but we had to be out by 10AM when they opened. Come to find out they already open at 8AM on Saturdays so they weren't doing us any big favors. They wouldn't help us advertise our event in their facility even though it would have helped draw people to their business. They offered us no freebies to our participants to encourage them to come back. Our group has over 2000 members in the local community that we could market Uptown Alley to and support as a local business but nope...they weren't interested in that at all. We weren't allowed to bring in donuts, juice, coffee or any food related items for our participants even though it was supposedly before they opened for business. We had to order from their restaurant with the sampling of breakfasty type items they had. Essentially, we were made to feel like they were REALLY going out of their way and doing us a favor by even allowing us to have our event there at all. If we weren't so set on trying to support a local business, we really would have gone somewhere else but our group really does make an effort to keep it local whenever possible.   The day of our event went off without a hitch. The staff was polite, courteous, helpful, kind and considerate. This definitely made up for the way we were treated in arranging this event. The bowling was fun with plenty of space, broad shoe selection, decent food, and drinks. The service was a bit slow considering they knew we had a group coming. There was 1 server for all of us and we were the only people in the place...which did open at 8AM per the sign on the door and their website! And he didn't really come back to check on us so my lane's guests only had 1 drink and that was it. The food was alright though and was definitely not what you would expect from bowling alley cuisine. Our group had fun though...but I think it's because it was a fun activity. I mean who doesn't enjoy BOWLING?  As I've understood it in my efforts to market this event, Uptown Alley isn't very community friendly at all. Our district's special education classes don't even go here because they won't give them a break on price! They go to Peoria to AMF! I'm sorry but if you can't support Special Olympics or SPED and give those kids a break, that's just not saying much about your business's philosophy.  So, although I'd like to say I'd go back to Uptown Alley because they are a local business and its important to support local businesses, it  might be solely as an independent person but not as part of my 501(c)(3) group.  I'm inclined to pass on group efforts since I believe that local businesses should also be supportive of the community. It's got to be a give-and-take relationship.

Ice custard happiness indeed! Brought the kids here after school today for our first visit and we will DEFINITELY be back! Blake, who was working the counter, was patient, helpful, and explained the menu items thoroughly to us newbies. Three of us had Gelati's which are a combination of flavored ice AND custard. Absolutely yum! One kidlet had blue raspberry ice that was delish!   AND they do school fundraisers as well! Love companies that give back to the community!  Can't wait to go back soon and try more flavors!

Have gone here at least once a week since my last review. I can honestly say that each and every visit has been a 5 star experience. From the friendly, polite staff who all seem happy to be there to the DELISH gelatis, mistos, and milkshakes that I've had...it's all been happiness galore.   The kids enjoy the Swedish Fish, Starburst, Cotton Candy, and Sour Patch Kids flavored ice. I am more partial to the fruit flavors with watermelon, strawberry, cantaloupe, mango, and passion fruit all being favorites of mine. My husband has to go with the sugar free and those flavors are DELISH too! And that's just the ice. The Frozen Custard is Ah-maz-ing. Seriously. I could take a bath in that vanilla custard. The custard here is more of a soft-serve version versus the kind you might find at Freddy's which is more hard packed. I prefer my custard softer so this works for me. And I love that they now offer a lite version and strawberry custard too. y.u.m. I had a peanut butter milk shake recently and it was to die for...seriously.   First timers, I recommend getting a gelati. That would be custard on bottom, ice in the middle and custard on top. This is the best way to enjoy what Rita's has to offer because you get the best of both worlds.   We truly do love Rita's and we know you will find a flavor you love too. But it's not my fault if you get addicted.....

We waited an hour to get in to this joint the other night but the wait was worth it. The burgers were excellent. Our server, Shawn, was friendly, funny, and very capable of dealing with a hungry crew of 10. The restaurant was packed so the service was a bit slow, but the food was worth the wait. We recommend the PBJ burger. I had the chicken sandwich which was excellent. Another friend said the Caesar salad was AWESOME. Lots of choices for even the most finicky of eaters. I wouldn't recommend it for the kids though. We bought our 3 year old and although the choices on the menu were ok for him, there is no kid menu. The restaurant is loud and raucous which is great for a night with friends, but not really for kids. Outside where we sat is mostly high tops so it's hard for kids to sit on chairs that high without worrying they are going to fall off. It's like constantly worrying about your drunk friend falling off the chair, except they aren't drunk..and is 3. LOL. Anyway, we are looking forward to going back for a grown-ups night soon! :)

Very accommodating to our large party on a busy Friday night! The food was excellent. The cornbread muffins were mini size which was a little disappointing but the rest of the food definitely made up for it. Drinks were kept full, food was served at the right temps, and what a fun spot to visit in downtown Charlotte. Hope I get to go back soon!

I've been a number of times to Red Embers and have never had a bad visit. The service is always friendly and prompt though I will admit, it's a bit less prompt at lunchtime which appears to be the time of day when they are training newbies.   I've had a wide variety of menu items and while none have disappointed, my favorites are the chicken pesto flatbread and the veggie tacos.   Look forward to future visits!

Wow. wOw. WOW. Did I say WOW, cuz WOW. And I mean wow in the best possible way! Party of 7 came by on a Friday night with no expectations, no reservations, and a 2 year old which can usually spell out a recipe for disaster but boy did Charr impress!   We were seated right away at a perfect size table and greeted immediately by our very friendly and very competent server. We received info on the specials as well as tips for first timers. Our drinks came right away and our server was even conscientious enough to ask if we should bring the 2 year old's food right away! (YES PLEASE!). Mr. Aiello himself came by to greet us twice and make sure that everything was perfect.   So, what did we have? I can tell you, I had one of the best salmon burgers I've ever had in my whole life. A delicious, perfectly cooked filet atop the most delicious house made garlic knot bun. What I loved most was the fact that the bun never got soggy from the lemon basil mayo sauce and the arugula was so fresh I'd swear that it was snipped that day!  The salmon was perfectly done. The baby had housemade macaroni and cheese that every adult at the table swore was the best ever. I think we might all have it next time as a main dish ourselves. 4 different cheeses mixed in the sauce and topped with a slice of cheddar and baked to perfection. O.M.G. Several of the grown-ups had the Phoenix Burger and the Charr Burger. Everyone said the burgers were DE-LIC-IOUS and cooked to perfection since so many of us have different degrees of doneness that we prefer.  Final friend had the pork tenderloin and while that fell a tad short versus the burgers, the overall dining experience left her feeling 5 star all the way.   Dessert was also superb. I had the Strawberries and Zabaglione sauce while others had the Apple Cobbler served hot with vanilla ice cream. All were super yum.   While this restaurant is very out of the way for us, we will definitely be making an effort to go out of our way again to visit Charr very very soon.  Thank you for a great experience and excellent food!

So worth the drive from El Mirage! The store is clean, the staff is friendly, and the food was DELISH! Best chicken schwarma since Doobie went out of business out in Mesa. We enjoyed a wide variety of dishes and a week later--my party of 9 is STILL talking about how good the food was. Going back this weekend!

Excellent. Pizza was yummy! Our server was friendly, kind, and worked very hard to keep all 7 of our drinks filled at all times. We enjoyed the wings, crispy green beans, toasted ravioli, and the olives for an appetizer. We also had the apple crisp, donuts, and cookie pizza for dessert. The pizzas...we had BLT, Meat Lovers, Organic Veggies, and the Fig and Proscuitto. All were excellent, unique, and served piping hot. We had a range of ages (2 to 48) at the table and everyone was very happy with the food. I'm very much looking forward to going back!

My in-laws are big fans of Nick's and Nick's II. I really don't know why. I can't figure out what the attraction is for the older crowd but there is a wait every time we come here as the restaurant is packed with older folks. Perhaps it's the large portions at cheap prices that has them overlooking the fact that the food is really not that great. The salad I had on our recent visit to Nick's II was a plate of romaine lettuce with a slice of tomato with 2 kalamata olives. Seriously. The veggie wrap didn't have any dressing or sauce with it and was so bland it was ridiculous. I asked for some balsamic and the server looked at me like I was crazy...and the balsamic never came. My husband had a ham and cheese sandwich that you would think would be hard to screw up...but again...blech. They used hand carved ham which SHOULD be WONDERFUL but they gave him the fattiest pieces on the ham so all he was chewing was huge hunks of fat. Not appetizing. The staff were all on edge because Nick (or at least who I think was Nick--older guy speaking with an accent wearing a Chef coat) was eagle-eyeing what the staff was doing in the dining room and critiquing. I wish he would spend more time in the kitchen and work on that dish-soap flavored chicken lemon rice soup or perhaps get creative instead of using frozen products to pass off as homemade.   Again, I don't know what the attraction is to Nick's or Nick's II but I will be doing my best to avoid both locations. You get what you pay for when you pay for cheap food....

This place is what Claire's WISHES it could be.  The sections are color coordinated, the prices are reasonable, and they have friendly, helpful staff.  The quality of the products are pretty good as I've had several rings that have oxidized. The purses are cute. The shoes and scarves are super reasonable. It's not tacky or overly ridiculous. It's easy to coordinate outfits with the pieces they have and Charming Charlie's just makes me HAPPY.  Take your time in this store. It's easy to get overwhelmed by all the pieces. And yes, they do have gift cards so you can bring more friends to become Charlie-addicts.   I've visited several Charming Charlie locations and this one is by far my favorite. The other locations are fine...I think because this is my first, it's the most special. But all the stores are nice and exactly the same. :)

Enjoyed a wonderful anniversary dinner last night on the patio. I think the thing I was most impressed with is the fact that there were several LARGE parties--like 10-15 tops--and the restaurant handled it with ease! The kitchen wasn't ridiculously backed up. The servers weren't harried and terse with other guests. In fact, 2 of those large parties were prom kids and I was very impressed with how the staff handled it all. Certain Italian restaurants in downtown Phoenix **cough cough**CIBO **cough cough** should come take note on how to handle large crowds while still treating all guests like they are important.   The food was spot on. We started with the smoked burratta for an appetizer. Creamy, silky, heavenly cheese topped with smoked leeks and truffle oil...what's not to love? I had the kale salad and husband had the Italian farro salad. Both were delicious, not overly dressed, and chilled. Love that. For entrees, I enjoyed the Jidori Chicken which was PERFECT. It was not overcooked or overseasoned and I love the frenched bone in. Wonderful. My husband had the Creekstone filet. He likes his steak well done and House Brasserie did not disappoint. For dessert, we shared the apple upside down cake. The pistachio ice cream really made the dish...the cake itself was just kind of meh....the ice cream definitely saved it.   The patio is BEAUTIFUL with lots of space and I highly recommend requesting outdoor seating if possible.   While this is a "special occasion" priced place, we will definitely keep this one in our repertoire of places to visit again SOON!

Way back in October I commented about the snow bird factor and now that it's July, that's no longer an issue. Stein Mart is one of my favorite stores and isn't as pricey as I thought. The "deals" are toward the back of the store while the "boutique" part of the store is right up front. The staff are very nice and much more relaxed now that they've had a chance to settle in and aren't overwhelmed by snowbirds.   As the 2013 snow bird season approaches, I hope that the staff will be better prepared and newbies to Stein Mart will have a better experience than I initially did. :)

Salted caramel frozen yogurt? YES PLEASE! It's no secret that I'm a big Fro-Yo fan and this spot, though a bit hard to find amid all the hub-bub of the big strip mall off Bell and Grand, is definitely worth the visit. Fro-Yo is fresh tasting with great flavor combinations to choose from. For those looking, it's on the side near where B of A, Starbucks and is right next to Pizza Hut.    The one thing I would change is the stark-white tables and chairs. Not a good mix with kids coming in. It seems to be becoming an industry standard with Fro-Yo places and this place is pretty sterile. The neon colored spoons are fun though and there is a wide variety of mix-ins to add to your Fro-Yo if you so desire.  A piece of advice--I hope that Razzleberriez will remember--when the snowbirds leave, your best customers are going to be us residents and we have kids so don't forget to appeal and cater to us as well. We'll be loyal to you if you are loyal to us!

Came with a friend on Black Friday after all the nut jobs went home to nap and it was worth the wait. Great deals, great stores, beautiful location. Parking was a little dicey however that's expected on Black Friday. Love love loved the H&M store! Great to have a Polo store, Hilfiger, Coach, Izod....so many choices. No need to go up to Anthem or out to AZ Mills anymore! The West Valley finally has some good shopping! Just keep in mind--not all the stores are "outlet priced".   My only complaint is that there is no food court! It would be the PERFECT SPOT for a little coffee shop (NOT STARBUCKS--too many of those as it is), or burger shop or something. All there is is one little lonely pretzel stand...big whoop. So Tanger--get some food in your Outlet and you will be PERFECT! Luckily, Westgate has some good selections and is a a small walk nearby.

Not because I wanted to, but I've had to come to SimonMed 5 times in the last couple weeks due to some testing/imaging I was requiring from my health care professionals. This location is conveniently located, even has some covered parking! The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and stays on time! The waiting room is spacious and the front office staff is NOT annoying. Now that is a win/win/win to me! :) If I have to have more testing done that requires imaging, I'll definitely request to come to SimonMed in Surprise.

Totally awesome dude! If you are a child of the 80's, this is a MUST SEE show! This show is only about 2 weeks old at the Venetian and it's already becoming a seasoned veteran star on the strip! The live show is 100 times better than the movie (which I happened to enjoy); it's far more fun because the theatrical experience makes audiences feel like they are inside the Sunset Strip's legendary Bourbon Room. The cast's energy is supercharged. They obviously love the songs, the wild dancing and the script which is slightly different than the movie so if you only know Rock of Ages from the movie, please--GO SEE THE LIVE SHOW! If you are a soap opera fan, you might recognize Kyle Lowder who plays Stacee Jax and he does a magnificent job! Justin Mortelliti plays Drew and he sings with such passion that it's clear that he not only loves his role, but really feels the music he's singing. He truly made the show. Mark Shunock plays Lonnie and is an absolute riot. Carrie St. Louis plays Sherrie and is tremendous.    Every little detail makes this show a blast--from the flashlight "lighters" to shine during the ballads, the jean jacket vests on the staff members, even down to the beer hawkers selling wine coolers! LOVED IT! The interactive nature of the show makes it that much more fun and will be the best money you spend on a Broadway-esque show on the strip.  Now, keep in mind, while this is a fun, interactive, supercharged show....it's NOT meant for kids. There are sexual overtones, drug innuendo, language, etc during the show making it not appropriate for kids....unless you are ready to have "the talk" with your kiddos and need some help 'splaining some things. LOL.   And don't forget to hit up the Bourbon Room after the show for some great 80s music and yummy drinks. It's a great way to keep the party rocking all night.  But seriously, if you get nothing from this review, take this to heart...my husband doesn't like musicals. He cannot understand why there is a need to break into song every 10 minutes during the show and I know that he came to this show to appease me...and even he LOVED this show. He's still talking about it today! So go to the Venetian and see Rock of Ages. You won't regret it and it's nothing but a GOOD TIME!

Boy are they caffeinated..er PERKY...at this store! I had my first visit but my kids go all the time when they are out with Dad so I actually had to read the menu. Pretty easy stuff to pick from but I'm not sure where they get their beans cuz after 5 sips of my iced coffee, I was W-I-R-E-D!   Son loves the thai chia latte iced with lotsa whip and my littlest guy likes the not-so-hot chocolate with the whipped windmill.   Cute place, fast service, but definitely will order decaf next time. LOL

New name but same old crap as UltraStar now known as Digiplex! Overpriced concessions, no loyalty programs and the same apathetic employees. Yet I will still come here because its a mile from my house! Honestly though I won't miss it when it closes. They aren't very generous to the community and they don't offer much value for the money. Drive the 5 miles to Harkins or AMC at WestGate if you are seeking the total movie experience.

Very well done version of the touring show. The singing was excellent--the variety of songs were really incredible. You can't help but tap your feet, clap your hands and sing along.   This one-act show has no set changes and is an examination of one night in the lives of Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, and Carl Perkins as they collaborated in the old Sun Studios together with their old manager before each of them exploded into musical phenoms. It's a simple show with classic tunes, superb singing, and live instrument playing. With so many shows over doing it with distracting glitz and set changes, the simplicity of Million Dollar Quartet is downright endearing. You catch your breath when they show the original photograph from the actual night the show is about and see the real Elvis, Killer, Cash, and Perkins playing together. It's truly a glimpse into a historical moment in music and one you will not regret seeing.   Definitely worth the price of admission!

Brought my boys in for lunch today. It has been a while since i've seen such excruciatingly slow service...to the point where we almost left several times during the course of our visit. I wanted to give this place a fair shake though so I sat it out. I'm not sure how this place is for dinner but lunch is not the time to give this place a visit.   The food was just meh. My older son had an 8in pizza that was alright. I had a buffalo chicken salad that was meh. My youngest had the cheeseburger sliders that were actually a good size and seemed pretty good. But boy was the service s....l....o.....w. Drinks took a while to get refilled. Food took forever to come out. It was like watching paint dry.   I might go back for an evening with friends just to see what it's like in the evening but I can tell you that I WILL NOT go back at lunch time.

Beautiful new building with energetic staff. We went on opening day so there is room to grow but it was very well run for an opening day.   Custard was good, but Rita's is better. Freddy's is more ice cream consistency and the flavor was refreshing though. It is piped down a long chute and is then scooped versus a softer serve style like they have at Rita's. The sundaes are pretty creative. Kids had the dirt and worms, brownie sundae, and their signature Turtle sundae. For me, I prefer to start out plain because if you can't get the basic, it doesn't matter what toppings you put on it. So, plain-Jane custard cone for me. All were tasty but again, more ice creamy than custardy.   Fast service though considering how packed they were and the drive thru seemed to hustle through pretty well as well...way better than at Culvers.   Looks like we've got a winner! I'll be back to try the burgers and will update my review from there. But, a good solid start and a welcome variety to Surprise.

Chipotle is Chipotle is Chipotle. Love the outdoor seating, the margarita options, and the fast, friendly service. It is a great location at Westgate and while others are fighting for a seat at the regular sit down restaurants, you can count on quality, consistent food at reasonable prices at this Chipotle location.

This place used to be MVP Nails and Spa but changed it's name in the last year.   I would have to say that this is by far my best experience at a nail salon. I have been here several times now and each time has been excellent. The staff is friendly, helpful, and very professional. My pedicures and waxes have been perfect experiences. The prices are reasonable and EVERYONE understands and speaks English clearly. I realize how that might sound, but for those of us who frequent nail salons, this is definitely an important factor. Plus, they are running a 10% off pedicure special! Can't beat that! :)

My husband and I have both been recent patients of Dr. David Bates and I can tell you from our experience--5 stars all the way! I will let him update you on his experiences.  I hurt my foot recently at the gym and Dr. Bates was able to see me the same day when I booked my appointment on Zoc Doc. Loved being able to fill out forms and have everything ready BEFORE I get there. Loved that I could get x-rays done of my injury ON SITE. Loved how quickly I was seen by the Dr. Loved that I could be fitted with an immobility boot ON SITE.   Dr. Bates was an excellent listener who was empathetic yet clinical but not so much that he talked over my head. He explained how my injury happened, gave examples, and shared with me what I can do to prevent it in the future.   Very impressed with Dr. Bates and am glad he's in my corner as a healthcare provider!

As prepared as I was to give this place a 5 star review, when I received my check and saw that I was charged for refills, it definitely bumped Tennessee Grill down a peg. Who doesn't give free refills on fountain drinks and iced tea anymore?   The food was quite good. Loved the house made potato salad and the fresh cut Tornado fries. The chicken wrap I had was WONDERFUL. The pulled pork was tender albeit a bit dry. Tennessee Grill prefers you dress your own bbq..which is fine but keep the pork in its juices or something.   We will go back in the future and just have water for drinks but definitely will do more exploring of the menu.

My toddler and i just completed the Mommy and Me Toddler B class and boy did we have fun! The teacher was very professional and fun and very welcoming to the kids. The pool and the surrounding area were super clean. I wish there was more shade and I wish that it wasn't quite so expensive for non-residents but the classes were worth it.  The Mommy and Me classes were meant to introduce children 18 mo-3 years old to the water, learn basic paddling, kicking, how to pull themselves out of the pool, how to float on their backs, etc. There was supposed to be 1 day where we talked about CPR but the teacher just gave us a handout and told us about compressions. There was no actual instruction or demonstration about basic CPR and I think that would have been important to receive. For me, that keeps this at 4 stars versus 5 because it was an advertised portion of the class that I felt wasn't fulfilled.   I do recommend these classes and the pool really is beautiful. With a great wading area, slides, diving boards, and lots of opportunity for instruction, teams, and socialization for kids there is something for every age group.   I did provide this feedback to the aquatic center and the rec department so hopefully they will make adjustments from there.

WOW! What a great experience we had visiting Fired Pie! I noticed this place as an up-and-comer here on Yelp and boy, you yelpers didn't let me down!  Located right next to the Starbucks by the Deer Valley 30, this little gem is a definite winner!  We visited as a party of 7 and we had a great time! What a novel concept-- pizzas are made to order with your choice of cheeses, toppings, sauces just like you would order a meal at Chipotle or Subway...and you just can't go wrong! Whether you build it yourself or order one of their signature pizzas, I'd be surprised if you found a choice you didn't like!  I love thin crust pizza so much and this place has just the right thickness--not too doughy but not paper thin either!  The kids running the counter were super helpful and knowledgeable. The general manager stopped by to check on us and he was very pleasant and recommended the cookies for dessert which were awesome!  My husband has been back with the boys a few times and loved it each time. I can't wait for my next visit...which I hope is VERY soon!  Absolutely LOVED it!

My mother introduced us to this fun place one afternoon for lunch midweek. We were only one of a small handful of tables but our server was great. I am surprised myself to say 'but' but there are so many times where you hit up a place that is a touristy spot on off hours only to be treated like you are invading their space. Not so for us. Our server was friendly, attentive, and very kind considering we also had the 2.5 year old in tow who just wanted to shake his booty on the dance floor. The music was fun, the food was tasty, and again, the staff was very friendly.  I look forward to making Whiskey Rose a part of my repertoire when visiting Westgate!

We have been a couple of times as drop ins and we are always greeted warmly, made to feel welcome, and given the full tour each time.  They are very friendly toward the preschool set which is nice considering those the the ones most likely to break something. You can use any and all supplies and are super helpful with ideas, tips, and techniques to make your piece of art a masterpiece. The studio fee isn't astronomical but I wish it was per party versus per person--especially when again...its you and a preschooler. But it's fine. Pieces are fired quickly and are ready for pick up usually within a week.   Got my first coupon via email and can't wait to use it this week!

I had the most amazing dinner at The Gladly. It's tucked in to the location formerly known as Ruths Chris steakhouse and boy have they transformed the place! It's so fun and they managed to figure out how to put a bathroom IN the restaurant as opposed to when Ruths was there and you had to use the building's bathroom.   We shared the sausage, pretzel, and cheese appetizer. We shared the chopped salad, my husband had the mac and cheese and I had the chimichurri chicken. In a word...OMG. The chicken was perfectly done, juicy and flavorful. The chimichurri sauce was not overpowering and if you combined that with a forkful of mac and cheese--holy cow. The chopped salad, while you might think is a simple easy peasy dish was complex, flavorful and HUGE. I will definitely order that as my main next time we go. My husband and I could not believe how delicious this salad was. We were so full we didn't get dessert but next time...and there WILL be a next time.  Service was outstanding...friendly, polite, and very helpful to newcomers. The place was busy but there was no lapse in service at all. We were very impressed. Can't wait to go back with friends.

Absolutely a joy from start to finish. I have had many dogs groomed over the years with various groomers and my experience at Margo's was by far the best. Margo is efficient, professional, knowledgeable, kind, gentle, and my bushy haired border collie dog looks AH-MAZ-ING! The store is clean and fresh smelling. Margo's husband also works at the store and is an excellent 'receptionist'.  I couldn't be happier and I will definitely go back!

I've been back twice since my last review and each time Margo's Pet Spa has been a joy to work with. They are super accommodating with availability, professional, knowledgeable, and very understanding of my Type A dog's personality.  My border collie looks fantastic when he visits and he doesn't fear the visit either which speaks volumes.  The store is fresh and clean, conveniently located, and hands down the best groomers I've dealt with.  Love it and highly recommend!

What a great visit! I've been driving by this plaza for quite a long time now and an impromptu date night led us to finally give West End Bar & Grill a try. Boy am i glad we did!   Nestled in a back corner of the lot behind Goodwill, it's definitely off the beaten track. You can't see it from the street, you have to pull in to the lot and head to the southeast corner of the back lot. And don't let the golf carts out front fool you--this place is BIG, FUN, and not just for the Geriatric crowd of Sun City West!  We enjoyed the wings for an appetizer. The wings were big and meaty with a nice crunchy coating.  I enjoyed the Veggie sandwich which was a portabello mushroom sandwich with mozzarella cheese and mixed greens on flat bread. It had a great pesto and balsamic dressing as well. It was EXCELLENT. My husband had the special which was a taco salad with a FREE margarita or beer. He had the marg. The taco salad was just the right size, fresh, and plenty meaty. We also had dessert--a lemon bar sundae. Everything was really very good.   Our server was friendly, interesting, and not intrusive at all. The other staff members were also friendly as well when they worked near our table, checking on us and removing plates as needed.    I am really looking forward to going back to West End. This place is a diamond in the rough here in Surprise and supporting small, local businesses whenever possible is what I'm all about!

3 Friends and I went Saturday to the Improv. I was very unimpressed. We've gone to the Tempe Improv many times and had great service and loads of fun, but the Improv at Harrah's downright sucked.  First of all, we didn't even get a server to take our drink order until the end of the first act. We didn't get said drinks until after the headliner took the stage. It appeared they only had 2 servers working the entire room. Not good for a Saturday night.   The show itself...sucked. The opener was this older guy, David Gee. So unfunny it was downright sad. The 2nd guy was a little better, Rick D'Elia had a few good one liners and got some chuckles from us. Rondell Sheridan was very funny but he focused for quite a while on "Tammy" from West Texas who thinks that Texas is another country...and maybe it is, but damn...20 minutes worth of this? Really?  If I could have gotten our money back, I would have. It sucked. Very disappointed.

Very unimpressed with Party Planet all the way around. We ordered two balloon arches for our school promotion ceremonies and they failed to deliver one of them. It was due to arrive at 8AM and they argued with us about the delivery time being 8:30AM when we called. They called to tell us they were on the way to our school to deliver it and then never showed up so we didn't have an arch for our morning ceremony. I am sure that the only reason we got our second arch was because of our angry phone calls about the first one being a reminder that they had to bring the 2nd by the afternoon.   Very unimpressed and will not be using them again in the future.

I have used several party rental companies in the Valley and White Knight was by far the friendliest and easiest to work with. We rented a 9 X 5 inflatable movie screen and had a very successful experience. We picked up from the office and was given a thorough explanation about how to set up the equipment, best practices, and more. Very fairly priced and reasonable to work with. We will definitely be back!

I do enjoy the perkiness of DBC and this new location, while not easy to navigate, is a winner here in Surprise. Great selection, tasty coffee, and fun kid drinks too! A nice addition to the environment here in Surprise.

Fun place with really good food.  For me, it's all about the side dishes. I gotta tell you--the coleslaw, potato salad, and cream corn were DELISH. I had a turkey sandwich and it was so tender and juicy. We all enjoyed ribs, the regular and jalape√±o sausage, and pulled pork. All were flavorful, tender and not overwhelmed on the sauces. The service was polite, friendly, and helpful to us as newcomers. The only drawback I felt necessary to mention is that there are a lot of flies. I realize it's built as an old gas station with the roll down doors, but there's gotta be a way to reduce the number of flies in the place.   We will go back when the weather is cooler...and there are fewer flies.

This is hands-down the best kept secret in Youngtown. Yep, you heard me right-Youngtown. That dumpy little town that you pass through between Surprise and Glendale on Grand Ave has THE BEST ice cream shop in the Valley. Oh you've never heard of it? Get with the times, people!  This ice cream is made on site and in flavors you've probably never dreamed of! And they have a food truck that we had come to our school's carnival that was just as awesome as the shop! $3 for a single scoop, $5 for a double. And the single scoop could feed 2 people easily so you know you're getting a generous deal. So many choices in flavors, floats, sundaes, toppings--it's all good.   If you are a fan of ice cream, and let's face it-who isn't in Phoenix in July--then make the trip to Youngtown and visit Mighty Moo or find out when their food truck will be in a neighborhood near you--or better yet, hire them for YOUR next event! You will soooo not regret it.   By the way, if you don't get the peanut butter explosion, you are just failing at life. Seriously.

My stylist recently moved to E Clips so my review is going to be on the location--I love my stylist (LISA) and have followed her to 3 different salons now.   E Clips is located in the same shopping center as Party Planet, Irish Wolfhound, and Rio Mirage Cafe in Surprise. So if you are familiar with that center, you know that parking is A MESS. Make sure you give yourself a little extra time to get where you need to go and add a little patience as well.  The salon itself is cute--very open--and spacious. The lady at the desk was very sweet, offering water while I waited and worked very hard to keep the place tidy. It's a bustling salon with lots of stylists and services offered. I like the shampoo sinks the best. The one other thing because its difficult location that I have an issue with is that it has that open ceiling floor plan. I don't know the right terminology for it--but it's the ceiling that isn't really a ceiling--you see all the pipes and stuff. I hope that makes sense...sorry for not having the right descriptor. But, because there is no real ceiling, the salon is noisier than a typical salon would be to a noticeable degree.  Other than that, E Clips is a very nice salon and I look forward to going back to see my stylist there!

In a word--OUTSTANDING. From start to finish, we've had an excellent experience with American Furniture Warehouse. The staff were easy to work with and went above and beyond to make our experience a success. From the helpful sales staff to the very professional delivery guys to the empathetic staff in returns, this has been an experience that is A++.   The furniture itself is well made, comfortable, and no issue. We were able to furnish 3 rooms at a ridiculously low price that I won't share here because it almost makes me feel like we stole this stuff from them--that's how great a deal we got!  The delivery team was friendly, courteous, and ON TIME!   We had to return our matching coffee and end tables set as the wood didn't match in the set and the returns desk was so easy to work with, it was absolutely refreshing.   I highly recommend AFW. You will not be disappointed.

Very pleased with our first visit. Portions were pretty big--like the Hibachi dishes were enough to share--and the service was excellent. I was surprised that the child's size beef teriyaki came with miso soup as well as a small salad, rice, tempura veggies AND the beef teriyaki. It was a sizeable portion for $7. I appreciated the Happy Hour pricing being extended. The Gyoza was good. Im not used to it being fried rather its usually steamed but it was good. The egg rolls were tasty. Not as good as Saigon Kitchen but its hard to top those. I am looking forward to going back!

I am a fan of Fired Pie and this store is a nice addition to the Tanger outlet area considering there is not really anything in the way of actual eateries there beyond snacks. The store is new, the staff is new so give it a chance. I love the concept of building my own salads and pizzas just like at Chipotle or Subway. Looking forward to going back! Pizzas were very good though and the roasted veggie salad was a perfect blend. Looking forward to improvements on the comfort level of the staff with the product and the place will be great!

As odd as it seems to give a 5-star rating to Dunkin Donuts, I have had nothing but 5 star experiences with this location. Although it's located in the heart of Sun City West, it is worth it to come in to get donuts and coffee. Just be careful for the 'clientele' at certain times of the year to be less than friendly. That's not Dunkin's fault. They are always polite, always friendly, and very helpful. The donuts are very fresh--not sure if they make onsite but they are super fresh. The coffee is excellent. Lots of great choices for every kind of coffee aficionado. My littlest guy LOVES coming to this shop and they are never without chocolate with sprinkles. :)

Wow! What an adorable little place hidden away on 3rd and Garfield! I had the spicy chai tea latte and an olive oil muffin. Wow. So delicious, so fresh, and the chai was the best I've ever had. I look forward to going back one day soon!

Pizza was pretty good-hot and fresh! The sauce was a little bland but it was definitely better than most in the area!  Service was friendly and polite. The restaurant is very bare-bones in decor but if you don't care about ambiance, this place is definitely a keeper. We will be back!

It's Denny's so it's the same quality as anyplace else. The service here is nice. They do make an effort to keep drinks filled and serve the food at the right temperature. But if you've eaten at one Denny's then you've pretty much experienced the menu so there's not much else to say!

For the longest time we went with the impersonal style of insurance carrier where you don't have an agent--you just call in to an 800 number and hope for the best. The problem with that is that the person on the other end of the line doesn't know you from Adam and therefore has no real vested interest in you as a customer much less as a person.   The best thing we ever did was switch from the impersonal online stuff to Chance Mikos. Chance treats every customer like a friend. He comes right to my home at times that are convenient for me about our insurance needs. He is never pushy or tries to sell me things I don't need. He doesn't try to oversell. As a family man himself he understands the dynamic of choosing the right products for the individual rather than trying to fit the individual into a box. He even takes the time to review my account and make suggestions or even to say hey, reviewed your account and we are right on target.   Whenever I have a question, Chance is a phone call or email away. I can always count on him or a person from the office to get back to me promptly. While Farmers might not always have the cheapest price, I'm actually willing to pay a little more because I have a guy like Chance on my side looking out for me and for my family.   Chance can count on us to be a customer for life.

Another new name but the same overpriced stuff. The theater is getting more and more run-down looking. Maybe the new owners will spruce it up? I hope so--the building isn't very old...  But expect more of the same so far with Carmike Cinemas as we have experienced with Digiplex and Ultrastar before it.

Although I can't speak to the sales experience at LHM because my husband is as much of a shark as the sales staff, I am writing this review on my experience with the service dept.  In my lifetime, I had a few positive experiences dealing with service depts at dealerships, but wow--Tom Rodriguez in LHM's service dept is a true gem. He explains things in simple terms, doesn't try to talk you into things you don't need, follows through with answers, follows up with phone calls, and doesn't treat you like an idiot. I didn't have to crawl up his butt to find out when my car would be done. I didn't have to remind HIM what my warranty covers. I didn't have to fight him to fix things properly. It was just done and done correctly the first time. He doesn't talk down to me because I'm a woman but he does take the time to explain things so I understand. Tom worked with me to find a time that worked in my hectic schedule, kept me in the loop, and made me feel like we on the same team in the service of my vehicle rather than making me feel like it's a battle.   I am VERY pleased with how I was treated, how my vehicle was serviced correctly the first time, and can't say enough nice things about Tom.
