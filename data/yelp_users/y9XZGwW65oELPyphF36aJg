Thirsty Thursday is the only thing going for this place. I've passed this place on Fri/Sat nights and it looks dead outside. On Thursday nights, however, this place is like all of ASU packed into a gas station. A gas station with extremely watered down fuel. Now, I'm not a heavy drinker but I'm not a lightweight either and I had quite a few drinks. Despite this, I left almost completely sober and bloated. I tried. No amount of dollar margaritas and 2-dollar "jagerbombs" were going to get me drunk.  Besides the weak drinks, the dance floor was packed and my drunken friends seemed to be having a blast. I'd only come back on two conditions: Thursday night, drink at the Cue Club beforehand. I didn't have to pay cover but my boyfriend did ($5) because we didn't know they had VIP card girls.

First off, I'm glad my mom dragged me around bargain shopping with her when I was little. Start em off young, they say. I love bargain shopping now, and Last Chance? No sweat. This is what I do when I need to de-stress.  I haven't had the chance to really fight for a deal yet. Meanwhile, I'll watch the worst in women come out in this survival-of-the-fittest environment. I have war stories to tell for each time I've gone in. Friendships broken. Alliances and enemies made. Children abandoned.  I have found some pretty amazing deals here, this is the bargain store I can go where all the clothes/shoes on the medium/7/8 racks aren't taken. I always leave having bought at least 1 thing. Designer brands for pretty much nothing, compared to their original price. Just beware of damage- that's why most of the stuff at LC's there in the first place.  Word of warning for bikini shoppers (or two-piece anything)- you'll go through hell and back more than once to find the right size and match. I have bikinis without their other half because I couldn't pass up the chance and hope to god I'll find the other half someday- even something that remotely matches or from another store. I walk around with them in my purse just in case I come across something that looks like it matches so I can try it on together. I have a BCBG bikini bottom that I bought one year, and finally found the matching top the next year.  Just to reiterate what everyone else has been saying: If you don't like to get down and dirty to find a deal, steer clear, because you'll get eaten alive in here. Stick to the Marshall's just outside.

I've only ever had my ears gunned at Claire's, so I can't compare HTC to any other piercing place, but I can say I was really happy with my experience.  After reading reviews on Yelp all day at work, I decided that I was going to drive like a maniac over to HTC as soon as I clocked out to get my piercing done and over with. I walked in 15 minutes before closing, shivering with excitement/fear/adrenaline/cold. There was only a single piercer (Peck) and the counter guy there and they were really nice and professional even though they probably wanted to go home. It was really clean and Peck talked me through everything- he freehanded the piercing and it was over before I knew it! I spent more time filling out the paperwork than getting pierced. Went home with a salt-water mouthwash and adrenaline high, piercing healed perfectly.  I haven't bought any jewelry from them besides the surgical-grade titanium that they put in initially, so I can't say anything on those besides they're all really pretty. I'm planning on going back for all future piercings, that's for sure.

I remember my mom buying boba at restaurants a couple times when I was younger and I just couldn't get over how gross it looked to see those slimy black balls shooting up the straw into her mouth. Well as I grew older, my tastes changed, and I've come to love boba. I wouldn't say I'm a fanatic, as it's only something I have from time to time, but when I do have it, I want to have the best. After trying mediocre boba all around town, I did my research and found The Street to be my best bet. I'm never going to buy boba from another place again, because this is the best boba I've ever had in Arizona. While it is a little on the pricier side, the cups are huge and the taste is fresh- they use real fruit and the boba is the perfect consistency. They don't skimp on the boba either. I tend to try to save my boba so I have enough to last me the whole drink, but I end up having a few rows at the bottom left over.  As for the non-edible aspects, I love the graffiti on the walls- it's so fun to look at while you're waiting for your order to be made. It's a small place, but it's not like it needs to be any bigger; I never stick around too much longer after I get my boba and I've never seen it completely packed with people. The main lady who works here is really nice and helpful if you're not sure what to order (she recommended me a strawberry milk tea when I wanted to try something new, because I was a strawberry smoothie fan, and I never turned back- it's like liquid heaven in my mouth), I've only ever seen her working and once I saw a younger girl helping out a little. It's kind of funny because the first time I walked in, I was expecting a bunch of teenagers to be working in a place like The Street, just because of how it looks.  Anyway, I love this place and it was even a selling point when I was looking for an apartment, because it's right down the street (no joke and no pun intended). Try it out :)

Okay so I assumed that if there's only 2 electric companies in a city and you don't have a choice which one you get with your residence, there wouldn't be much of a difference in service. Well. I guess I'm a fool.  I've been with SRP since I moved out on my own and I didn't love it because I was paying for a necessity but whatever. Responsibilities as an adult, right? Then I move to this place that happened to be in a small pocket in Tempe controlled by APS and BAM my electric bill went from $30/mo to $75. Well that's strange, maybe it's just some startup fees/deposit and I guess I accidentally left the heater on all day a few times. Oh, just kidding, I have SIXTY DOLLARS OF FEES. My actual electricity usage? $15. This is absolutely ridiculous. I'm sure my neighbors think they're living next to a psycho now, because you should've heard the tantrum I threw (assumption could also be due to me being alone most of the day, talking and singing to myself rather loudly, but lets disregard that fact).  Sweet, fee-less SRP, I can't believe I took you for granted. If I could, I would break my lease over this just to move back to you. Now I know why you're supposed to ask what electric company is used before you move into a place. (Very expensive) lesson learned. Once I'm out of here, APS is never going to see a penny from me again. Doesn't matter that my actual electricity service is fine (the 1 star), but the fees are just plain unfair and bad business practice. I can't believe they're still around.
