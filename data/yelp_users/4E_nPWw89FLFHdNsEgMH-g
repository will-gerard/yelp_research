Very, very nice theater. I swear there is not a bad seat in the house, unless of course you are sitting behind a tall person and then you are screwed. I was lucky enough to see the performance, Daddy Long Legs and both the actors (Megan McGinnis and Robert Adelman Hancock) did a fantastic job. They kept you entertained the entire time which is what you want in a musical/play. (although there was a woman behind me who fell asleep and starting snoring.. wowza)   The bathrooms ( which I frequented before, during intermission, and after) are quite clean which is always a plus in my book. The staff were friendly and very helpful and I will have to check out the play roster for this theater to see what else may be coming up.

Yes I know this place is now apparently closed but I only went their once and had a really good time. It was March 2006, my birthday dinner, and staff were great, the food was really good. Sorry to hear that it seemed to had gone downhill. Oh well, I enjoyed my one night with Fate and I will always have those memories.

It has been about two years since I last came to Honey Bear's. The last few time I had visited, I felt like the portions were a little skimpy for the price I was paying. However that all changed when I brought my dad for a late lunch/early dinner.   We order the full slab with potatoe salad and beans. Man when we got home, the plate was packed with ribs. So much so that the two of us sharing was not a problem. I am not a fan of potatoe salad, however I will admit that theres was quite tasty! The bbw sauce was better than I remember and although my dad enjoyed the sauce, he makes his own and just had to say there's is good but mine is still better. SMH!.   They have revamped the menu to make it a little more affordable and they seemed to have up there portions a tad. Way too go. My dad enjoyed one Phoenix's hometown spots. Good job! I will be back again soon for rib tip Friday's!

Not a Sweet Tomatoes that's for sure. The selections are scarce and when you are use to all they have to offer at the Sweet Tomatoes, you are definitely disappointed when you see what they have to offer at this Souper Salad. In a pinch it would work, but you can definitely find something else better.

Cheap drinks! and it wasn't even happy hour! SCORE! Seriously. I thought this place was a Chinese food place due to the name. I had no idea it was actually a Pub. My mistake. I was here this past Saturday celebrating a friends birthday and we enjoyed ourselves. Between people watching and just talking about everything (and I do mean everything) plus the drinks were cheap. What more can a girl ask for? I will definitely be back here again!

All you can eat limited sushi on Saturday for around $20. Sold. I crashed Dottsy Z's  party with two other lovely ladies (Hi Amber and Debi) this past Saturday after literally stepping off of a plane and seeing her post that she was here. The funny thing was that I wasn't really hungry, until I saw all the yummy food in front of me. Eel rolls, Las Vegas rolls, Toosie Maki Rolls, Spicy Tuna Rolls, good lawd I was in heaven. I ate so much that I arrived looking "skinny" and I left looking as if I was expecting a baby sometime in the very near future lol. Sad case yes. Our waitress was extremely nice but a little overworked since it appeared as if she was working the entire restaurant solo. So if you are hankering for some sushi, go on a Saturday over to Moto Sushi. But be warned, you must eat everything that you order if you order off the all you can eat, or you will be charged 50 cents per piece that you leave on your plate. So don't overdo it. (We left nada! lol)

I swear this is a great "dive" bar. The drinks are cheap and good and everyone is always so friendly. I always forget about this place and have only been twice in my 8+ years here in Phoenix but I think I will need to change that. Seriously a great place to just hang out and, grab a few drinks and just chill.

Hi Werner!! Yep gotta give a special shout out to the newest bartender on his first day  working at Rokerji. He was awesome and he spoiled me and Soraya rotten. :)  This is cute but small little place. As I was walking up, two different couples instantly said, I hope you have a reservation as they were walking away. Uhoh... this can't be good. I called Soraya who was in route to ask if she had made reservations.. hmm nope. Crap. So when she arrives, I sucker her into going downstairs since everyone that went down, came right back up. Lo and behold there were two seats at the bar. Hmm interesting that no one saw that lol. We hoisted ourselves up and was immediately greeted by Werner as well as the rest of the bar staff. We ordered our wine a bottle of the cupcake wine, which was delicious and it was half off seeing as it was Monday :). We also ordered the prime rib sliders, brie toasts, and the tacos. The people next to us had commented on how hot the tacos were and was wondering if we could handle the heat as they said they couldn't. Don't get me wrong, they were spicy, but I make things way spicier so I was use to it. Soraya well not so much lol.  The tacos, sliders, and brie toasts were so good, The prime rib was cooked perfectly and the au jus to dip it in was num yummy. We also ordered the flour-less chocolate cake that was more like a sinful fudge. Delicious. We even got to move over to the fire place to continue chatting it up and enjoy our wine and dessert.  I will definitely be back, especially if Werner is working. :)

Cooler than average chill spot to come to, especially if you are on a date. You can cozy up in a quiet corner and have some drinks and really get to know someone. If you have never been, it can be a little hard to find, but worth it.

I took myself out to dinner tonight to Vincent's on Camelback for restaurant week and I have to say it was great.   Service Jodi -  The General Manager, Fabulous! Alex - I believe that was my main waiters name- great guy but the other guys who brought out my food, filled my tea, and just came to check on my on a regular basis were so great and very thoughtful. I guess they don't get very many ladies dining alone :)  Food Warm Croissants - YUMMY! So very good.  First Course - Ratatouille Tart with Parmesan Crisps & Black Olive Tapenade - Light and fluffy with lots of veggies. Came with a small salad that was pretty tasty as well. Olive Tapenade is always a little salty regardless of who makes it however this one was not as salty as most. Very good.  Second Course- Duck Confit with Citrus Sauce - YUM! Cooked to perfection and the sauce was just right. Also came with a small portion of scalloped potatoes, a couple of veggies. Only ate half as I wanted to make sure I saved room for dessert. So needless to say I have enough for dinner tomorrow night. They even packed in a few extra of those mouth water croissants. Double kudos for that.  Third course - Warm Chocolate Tarts with Fresh Whipped Cream - SINFUL! Seriously mine came out nice and warm, fresh from the oven with a nice dollop freshly made whipped cream. So very good indeed.  I must say that dining alone has its perks. I got to people watch, even watched a proposal (she did say yes by the way) and the staff were really nice and very attentive. I will definitely have to visit them again soon.

How have I never written a review for this place? What the hell? My coworker goes there at least once a week to pick up her (our) orders. We get the spicy chicken bowl and we order so much that the woman who runs this place knows her (our) order lol. Depending on who makes the dish determines the level of spiciness, but it is yummy for your tummy goodness. Oh and don't forget about the chocolate chip cookie. There have been numerous occasions in which by the time we order our lunch, they are already out of them since she makes them fresh everyday. So not fair! Even the sandwiches are yummy, but the spicy chicken rice bowl is number one in my book!

Like their competitor Sprinkles, Tammie Coe is just way to sweet for me. Their frosting is heavier and their is just something in their cupcakes that makes me wonder what is that? As much as my coworkers enjoy both Tammie Coe and Sprinkles, I pass everytime someone brings them in as I am just not a fan. For those that enjoy them, by all means I am not mad at ya. Just don't understand what all the fuss is about.

I hadn't been here since the yelp event last year. The chips and salsa are to die for and it it took everything in me not to eat all of the, since I call myself being "good". I did order the shrimp tacos (sans the tortilla) which were delicious and the service was great. I will definitely come back again to see how things are during happy hour and heck just for the chips and salsa.

I have been here many times for various events and yet it is showing as my first check in. Weird. At any rate I was here for my birthday dinner with four other girlfriends this past Friday.  The company I was with was worth five stars in itself along with the view. Our server was friendly although preoccupied and quite busy. It took awhile to receive menus when we sat down which was a little odd but we shrugged it off. We ordered two bottles of the Arizona Stronghold wine, the duck confit ravioli, pork belly, short ribs, steelhead trout, filet, and the pork tenderloin. Holy cow the food (all of it) was absolutely amazing. Even the bread along with the three different dips for it was delicious.  We shared all of our dishes and everything was melt in your mouth good and succulent.  The pork belly really did melt in your mouth and the sauce..oh my we were fighting (playfully) over dipping our bread in the sauce. My steelhead trout was the best I have had to date. I was so full but I made sure to eat every last bite (my stomach was not happy with me). All the other ladies throughly enjoyed their meals as well. How we actually had room for dessert I still have no idea but we all took one for the team and ordered dessert as well. I was surprised with a happy birthday creme brulee from the chef which was just as heavenly as the rest of my meal. The wine,  the company, the food, the service  (once things slowed down) was perfect. I cannot wait to come back again!

Oh Chili's. You really let me down this past Friday night. From the cheese fries being old (as if they had been reheated and reserved)  to the cooler than average steak. I did send the cheese fries back  and got a piping hot new order but I didn't send back the steak for fear of what may have been done to it after sending back the fries and also for fear that it would come out a hockey puck. I will say that even though it was not as warm as it should have been, it was at least cooked to perfection.  I will say that I was not the only patron sending food back in my area. The table in front and beside me also sent back food for various reasons. At least I wasn't alone in my food unhappiness. Eh I may come back again someday but you are not on my go to list anytime soon.

I have passed by this location for years however I had never stopped to have an actual service done until today. I have gotten plenty of air checks done here but that was about it.  I do still go to the one in North Scottsdale but they will now have serious some competition since they are kinda close to me house (N.Scottsdale is close to work). I must say that every time I have stopped ( yes I know I have only one check-in but I was never here for longer than 5 mins. I mean why check in for an air check?) it has always been after right a mad rush which is AWESOME for me because that means in and out quick. Even the oil changed I received on a Sunday no less, they had me in and out in what 30 mins tops? Crystal, whom I remember from my favorite Scottsdale location works here and she is one bad (as in very good) mechanic/service tech! I so adore her as well as Tim who was a manager.  Any who, If you are ever in the area, stop by get your services done, and keep it moving. They are friendly, fast, fair and they let you know what needs to be done either right then and there or sometime soon.

This place was awesome and Gwen was fabulous. I came here last night after a friend of mine and I were trying to find a place to grab drinks close to where we live. Gallagher's came up on the search offering happy hour and reverse happy hour 7 days a week. Score! We walk in and it wasn't very crowded yet so we grabbed a couple of seats at the bar. Gwen let us know they had specials on Coors light and a special drink for Halloween called vampires kiss which was only $3.00 all night. Yummy. Oh and after 10pm when karaoke starts, long islands ice teas are only $2.00 and believe me, with some of the singers we needed one.   Oh final thing, their wings are amazing and cheap after 10 on Saturday. Our bill was a shocker to us because we drank alot and ordered some wings. So very reasonable. We will most definitely return soon.

Picture this, New Years Eve, driving down Bell Road and bam, you run over something and your tire goes flat. So you proceed to pull over, beg someone to help you put on the donut so that you an go to the nearest Firestone to get it fixed.  You walk in and they are busier then heck on this NYE. However the friendly guy behind the counter says no problem, we will get you all squared away in about an hour or so.. is that ok? Oh and it is only going to cost you $47 as you had warranty on your tire. Hmm HELL YES that is just fine. They were friendly, helpful, and they let me know about a few more issues that I may want to check on at my next oil change, but I was in and out before they closed at 5pm. Thank you again for squeezing me in and taking good care of me.

I am giving them 4 stars for making the heaviest batch of nachos I have had in a very long time. It was piled high with tons of meet, cheese, guac, sour cream. I was in nacho heaven. Yes I have been to just about every -icos, bertos, etc, but they were very generous on this particular day and I know it. Thank you for helping with my nacho fix. If I am ever in this part of town again, I just may stop in and say hi.. and grab some more nachos!

I enjoy going to this location to buy fresh fruit and their freshly made tortilla chips. The prices for their fruit is way cheaper than other places as well as their jalapenos. I don't really buy the groceries as they do seem to be a little higher than other stores, but their produce department gets two thumbs up from me.

I enjoy going to this nail salon because the ladies are friendly, its clean, and they do a great job on my pedicures. From just people watching, I can tell that most of their customers are lifers as they know them by name and they have the same person at the same time every week. Stop by and tell the ladies that Ebony sent you :)

This place is still, after almost two years, my favorite nail salon to go to. Plus they received a 100% on their suprise inspection and that is always a plus in my book. The ladies are still as friendly as always and the owner Don is one cool guy.

2.. the number of hours I spent here getting my new social security card with my new last name. 7. the number of minutes it took, once my name was called to get a new SS card ordered for me in said last name. I pray that I never have to come back to this place again after that crazy experience. Plus it was FREEZING! What the crap?

I tried this place out all because of Shane's ROTD and yep it lived up to its greatness. I ordered a appetizer platter, twice cooked pork and pork fried rice. (Apparently I was craving pork which is beyond rare) Man all of the food was really good. The egg rolls were stuffed with yummy goodness, the honey chicken was finger-licking good, there was TONS of pork fried rice packed into that container. My goodness was it stuffed. The only disappointment was the twice cooked pork. Don't get me wrong it was good, but when I ask for extra, extra spicy, that is exactly what I am expecting and it fell short. :(  But will it stop me from going back,? heck no. I am already thinking about what I will be ordering this coming weekend.

I hate this store, especially this location. I hate it because I go in to buy one thing and I come out with a bag full of stuff! Today for example, I went in to buy a few accessories I need for a dress I am wearing to an event I am attending in about a week. Easy right?. Nope. I should have checked out after I found what I wanted, but noooo, I just had to wander over to the clearance section to see what I could find. Grrrr!!! Needless to say I got a Vera Wang dress on clearance for, brace yourself, $6.63 (originally $78.00), a pair of capri's for $10.20 and all my accessories.  Darn you Kohl's for your awesome clearance section.   P.S. I will be back to shop again soon!

A few weeks ago, I was receiving quotes to have my AC unit replaced due to the hail storm we had back in October. I had few companies come out but no one and I mean no one was as thorough as Dale with Mason Mechanical was. He spent 90 mins going over everything including climbing in the attic to check things out. He explained the differences between different units as well as what he and his team could do, which included taking out my furnace and installing a new ac/heat unit, pricing. etc.  Fast forward 3 weeks later and I was able to get the appt set up to have my unit installed. Crystal set up everything for me  and she was fabulous, especially since I had to cancel the first time around due to my work schedule. (Thank you for your patience Crystal!!) Mike, the tech who was in charge of installing the new system called me promptly at 7am to let me know he was on his way and would be at my house within 30 mins. Fast forward 10 hours later and my new unit is installed. He explained everything to me including how to work my new programmable thermostat, made sure everything was in working order, sealed off the area in my now new closet (where the furnace was), made sure everything was cleaned up, and was just all around great. I am very happy that it was nice mild day here today because I don't know how they can do this in the summer.  Thank you to the entire team at Mason Mechanical!

All you can eat sushi for $20? Yes please. So I finally met up with my friend Chris, who lives close to this place for some all you can eat Sushi on a Saturday afternoon. The place was empty, but then again it was around 2pm ( although it picked up by the time we left) We had a little bit of everything as there all you can eat menu is pretty generous. Be careful as you must eat what you order or you will be charged. ( no worries as we made sure there was not a crumb left). Ladies, be advised that their ladies room is a little scary. I mean its kinda dark in there so just be careful! All in all, not to shabby and I will be back to visit again soon.

A friend and I visited this location yesterday. Things didn't start off so well as after we were seated, it took approximately 10 mins for anyone to come to our table. We weren't upset about it we were just like hey, what about us? lol. Luckily for us, the person that happened to check on us just happened to be one of the manager's, who name I did not get. But she greeted us with a wonderful smile and asked if we had been helped. Sadly we said no and she took care of us right away with assigning Phillip to our table and he was fabulous. The first round of drinks was on the manager, which was really sweet. Again we were not upset at all, just wondering what happened. At any rate the strawberry margarita I received was delicious as always. We also ordered the Trio, which was on happy hour and consisted of chips, queso, and salsa. Delicious!!! Of course we had to order their signature cornbread, which was fresh out of the oven upon arrival. It was melt in your mouth delicious and yet so bad for you so you know it is extra good. By the time my yummy street tacos came, I was full from everything else.  Like I said before, Phillip, our waiter was awesome, the food was delicious, and my company was as fabulous as ever. Will I come back to this location? Of course! I chalk it up a slight mishap and a busy evening. Plus in the end, the food and service was great so what more could you ask for?

A decent little nail salon that I go to if the place I regularly attended is way too busy. The ladies (and the guy) are really nice and its never really busy  (at least when I go) and the only reason I don't go their more is because its just a little bit more expensive. Not by much, but I just have a great rapport at the other place as I have been going their longer.  If you are in the area, check out China Nails. They will definitely take good care of you.

A solid 4.5 stars. Half a star knock off for the HUGE and I mean HUGE cockroach that decided to make itself known in my otherwise FANTASTIC room. I swear that sucker came with luggage and was ready to move in.  I got a smoking deal on hotwire that I will probably never get again! The room was  like a mini one bedroom apt with a stove. The bathroom was huge, bedroom was huge, living room was huge. I was in resort room heaven (until my unexpected visitor) The staff were super friendly and I loved that security was always walking around the property.  I seriously did not want to leave it was that nice. I will definitely stay here again in the future as it was a nice little get away for myself and yet I was still close to home. Perfect staycation for 1!

I have been here twice on a whim. The first time I ate my breakfast there and it was pretty decent. The second time, I placed an order to go and unfortunately I should have checked it before I left. The food was dripping in grease. Not sure what that was all about but I was so disappointed. Did I eat any of it, yes because I was hungry however that was a mistake as I felt sick to my stomach later that day. I will give the restaurant another try  one day as maybe the cook was having an off morning. Like I said before, when I ate at the restaurant,  the food was decent, but take out, make sure you check it before you leave so that you don't end up with a box of grease. Blech

I have driven from North Phoenix to come and get some of their chinese food. Heck I stopped on my way home from a business trip to get some of their chinese food. Can you tell I am a fan. Seriously the food is really good and the portions are huge. A friend of mine and myself actually stopped their on our way to a drive-in movie once and gorged ourselves while watching some "scary movie" that was out at the time. I do enjoy their food and will be back to visit them again real soon!

Yummy for my tummy. I was here for  a special lunch with my coworkers and let me tell you this place was PACKED! I was happy I made reservations because it was was butt cheek to butt cheek packed. I order the Crispy Duck Confit Sandwich that was so good, if I was at home I would have licked the plate. The regular house fries were delicious to the point that we were almost fighting over the last one. Sad but true. The chocolate souffle was just ok considering that they talked it up to be something great. I was expecting amazing but it was just ok. I will definitely be back for lunch or dinner real soon. I have got to try that French Onion soup because it looked and smelled amazing.

Eh... its an ok place to go. The service was pretty decent when we went but it was kinda empty for a Thursday evening or maybe it was just my perception and the food was just ok..  I don't know, I mean for me to write a short and non-indepth review that says alot. Maybe they were just having an off night? I may give them another chance one day in the future.

I do enjoy doing takeout their for lunch. I mean for under $10 you can get a pretty big meal, a salad, and the fried wonton chips. I do know that they use to have a little bit of cinnamon and sugar coated on them and lately, not so much. At any rate, rumor has it that you don't get the salad at dinner time? Try it out, you won't be disappointed.

I went there today with some coworkers for lunch for the all you can eat fish special that they have on Friday's and it was very much worth it. Upon entering the bar/restaurant the first thing I noticed was how dark it was. The next was how big it was. There are two sides to this place and we opted to go to the side that had more lighting. I mean I don't know about you, but I want to actually be able to see what I am a eating.   So after being seated and having our drink order taken, it took a minute for someone to actually come and take our order. It was kinda weird as it didn't seem to be that busy but who knows. In the end everyone ordered the fish and we all had it differently. Some had it fried, some had it baked, some had it blackened/cajun and we all either fries or onions rings. Let me just say that it was worth the wait. The fish was so moist and fried perfectly. I had a piece of the cajun as well and it was seasoned just right. Oh and the onion rings? Good lawd they were good. I am not sure what they did back there in the kitchen, but they most definitely made up for our wait.   The bill came and we were pleasantly surprised. The all you can eat fish special pretty much included the drinks for only .25 cents. Cool huh? So $13 or so dollars per person, plus tip and a VERY full stomach later, we all hobbled out of there and went back to work fat and full. As a matter of fact its 10pm and I am still full from lunch today. Sad but true and I only had one plate of fish!!! The all you can eat fish fry is worth it if you like fish. Be patient because its worth the wait.

I like Morton's. I have been to quite a few Morton's in my lifetime, but last night, this particular location left me with a bad taste in my mouth.   See I was there a wine event, and in my defense, I knew I should have made sure that I had enough cash on me prior to arriving, but I didn't think anything of it. After finally finding a parking spot and walking in then did I realize, crap I don't have enough cash. The young lady that was taking money for the even was nice and she stated that I could fill out a credit authorization form, which is me basically writing down my credit card information on a piece of paper for them to charge later. Yea no. I wasn't comfortable with that idea so she said to try to the bar as they should be able to help you.  So I go over to the bar and it was busy, but not overly busy. I made eye contact with both bartenders, smiled and waited. 5 mins later, I am still waiting and never received a " I will be right with you, or Hi their, what can I get you" however other patrons that came up to the bar after me were helped immediately. Yea FAIL!  Even then I was like ok, I let it go. Yes I was disappointed but I let it go. So go to try to find a manager to see if I could find a way to pay for the wine event that was going on. I explained the situation to the hostess at the door and she called over a manager or the head hostess guy, I am not sure. She explained to him what my request was he told that hostess "I can't assist her right now" (meaning me). She then said "but can't we just scan her card for the $15, it will only take a minute?", and the he again proceed to say, "I don't have time to do that so no I cannot assist her". Mind you I am standing right next to both of them as this conversation is happening. If you could have seen the look on my face. The hostess immediately apologies and I tell her it is fine, no worries and I turn to walk out the door when the manager or head hostess says to me, " Can I do anything else for you?" What the??!!! Are you kidding me?  Hmm no,  but thanks. You have been most helpful.  So needless to say that I did not attend the wine event and I left Morton's very disappointed. From the service I received at the bar down to the head hostess or manager.  Yes I know I should have made sure I had cash on me for this event but seriously?  Funny thing is that I went to another place to calm down and to have a drink. Although I was upset, I still smiled and made eye contact with the bartender and she immediately came over to me and said, "Hi!  Give me a second and I will be right with you". Get this, this bar was BUSIER than Morton's.

I enjoy this place at happy hour as they have some really go prices. All of their appetizers are half off as well as a few of their drinks. I do wish they had more rolls on the happy hour menu but hey you take what you can get. You can eat pretty good for less than $10 during happy hour and that includes a beer. Not too shabby if you are on a budget like me! :)

I enjoy ordering my cakes from this particular Safeway, and this past weekend was no different. I was a little worried as I was ordering a very specific birthday cake that I need on Saturday October 24, for a friends birthday party. She basically wanted a strawberry shortcake, cake (you know whipped cream frosting, fresh strawberries in the middle, strawberries  and whip cream on top). When I went to Safeway on October 19 after going to 3 other locations to attempt to order this cake, Miss Frida informed me that they were currently out of strawberries and wasn't sure when they would get their shipment in. All I was thinking was its Monday and I don't need this cake to Saturday and there is a chance that Safeway wouldn't get a shipment of strawberries? But its MONDAY and I don't need it til SATURDAY is what my mind was screaming. Alas I took it all in stride as Miss Frida told me not to worry and that she would call me on Friday if for some reason they didn't get any strawberries in time and that we would work something out.   So after having a mini panic attack as I had already been to 3 other places in the last 48 hours and was tired of cake shopping but I was determined to get the type of cake my friend wanted. So Friday rolls around and although I had not heard from Frida, I decided to stop in anyway to see what the progress was. She let me know that that had received a fresh shipment of strawberries on Thursday and that everything was a go. Needless to say my mind was instantly at ease.  So fast forward to Saturday, I pick up the cake, which looked fabulous and headed on to the party to finish setting up and getting everything ready for all the guest. When it came time to cut, the birthday girl was beyond happy and let me tell you, that cake was OFF THE HOOK! Talk about fresh. My goodness. Everyone loved the cake and couldn't believe that it came from Safeway. The birthday girl was happy as she got exactly what she wanted and the guest loved it. Hats off to Frida for making one hell of a cake and to Safeway for not letting down!

I know I know, another review about an auto repair place. Hey I have three that are my favorites and this just happens to be #3. I like going to this particular Firestone because:  1. The manager is cool and doesn't treat me like I have no idea what the hell I am talking about.  2. I have lifetime wheel alignment and tire rotation on my car from Firestone and they are close to where I live.  3. The service techs are nice guys and patient when someone like me has 1 million questions about everything,  4. If they have a coupon on the service you are receiving, they give it to you to help keep your cost down.  So there!  I like this Firestone. Need I say more? :)

I am still coming to the same Firestone years later and the same guys still work there and they are still good to me. The make sure I don't pay for services I don't need and when I do need something, they make sure it is taken care of asap and try to make sure it doesn't cost a small fortune. Even my coworkers in my office have started going to this location and they guys are good to them. Plus they know if they aren't I would give them hell, and the last thing they want is a mad Ebony on their hands lol. I trust them as they know my car is important to me. So in a nutshell, yes I still like this Firestone. The end! :)

Red Lobster can sometimes get a bad rap, but I had a blast there this past Friday night. We got there around 6:30pm and the line was out the door. No biggie as we had nothing else to do and we wanted the endless shrimp. Plus my friend had never been to a Red Lobster and it has been about 2 years since my last visit. So after waiting only about 30 mins we got seated and were on our way to pigging out.   First off, let me give a special shout out to our waitress Carina! She was very sweet and took great care of us. Thank you Carina!   So we both knew that we wanted the endless shrimp meal but being the hungry people that we are, we also ordered the appetizer that had stuffed mushrooms, fried clams, and bacon wrapped scallops. YUM! Everything came out piping hot and was very good. I mean bacon wrapped scallops. HELLO! Best of both worlds. The cheddar baked biscuits were still as good as I remembered and fresh out the oven. My friend loved them and was very excited that they brought out more once we had downed the first batch. Oh I also have to give a special mention to the Triple Berry Sangria that they now offer. WOW! Now that is some yummy sangria. Almost as good as mine (LOL) but seriously very good.   Now on to the endless shrimp, we each got to start off with two choices so I chose the teriyaki shrimp and the cajun shrimp and my friend had the garlic shrimp and the coconut shrimp bites. They both come with your standard salad and side of french fries, mashed potato, baked potato, rice or veggies. My friend bumped it up and ordered the lobster baked potato. Needless to say that was one of our favorites as well.   So back to the shrimp. OMG they were so good, and as soon as Carina bought out or dinner she asked us if we wanted to go ahead and get started on another order of shrimp so that way, but the time we may be done with our first order, more shrimp would already be on the way. She did this for us each time and I finally threw in the towel after my 2nd order but my friend ended up having about five orders. Carina let us know that our first order has ten shrimp in each dish and the orders after have about 7 or 8. Weird but hey, keeps the waste down I suppose. I was beyond stuffed when it was all said and done and very happy. The head manager came over and said hello and to make sure that we were happy with our meals. Very nice. Needless to say, it was a great time and the food was very good.

The only reason I am giving this 1 star even though I will probably go back to do some shopping for packaged food and such from time to time but will NO LONGER be tasting the free food is the fact that I witnessed one of the food tasters blowing her nose while standing at a food tasting table, and NOT only did she NOT wash her hands, but she did NOT change the plastic gloves that she was wearing before continuing to handle food to give out as samples. I was so stunned that i just had to walk away. Yes it was my fault for not bringing it to a managers attention but if you could have seen the stunned look on my face. She did not notice me but I damn sure noticed her. STUNNED! I remember exactly what she looks like and will be reporting her but again just stunned that she did that in plain view of everyone. Can we say blech?!?!

I HATE and I do mean HATE going to the dentist. However Dr. Dachs and his team always makes my visit a pleasant one. I always see Dr. Chris who I swear is not old enough to be a dentist, but he does an excellent job. The entire staff from the receptionist to the hygienist, to the Dr's. have all been very wonderful and patient with a wimp like me. They are always honest and upfront about every procedure that I have had or may need which hasn't been much (thank goodness). So if you are looking for a great dentist office, go and check out them out. You will be pleasantly surprised!

I still HATE going to the dentist, but I do enjoy the service I receive at Thompson Peak Family Dental. All the hygienist are great but today I received the best cleaning every from Deena (sp?) My teeth seem extra shiny/white and she worked her magic for almost an hour to make my pearly whites pearly lol. The bad news in all of this is that I do have a cavity :( Oh well. I enjoy going to see Dr. Dachs' and will continue to do so. I mean as much as I hate going to the dentist at least I go to the best!

Ah yes, Thee Pitts Again. Its been a year since I have visited this place after seeing it on Triple D. I am always down for trying a new place and a new BBQ place? Shoot I am so there. Well lets just say that I was not overly impressed and Triple D let me down again.   The place was packed when we went but we didn't have to wait long for a seat. Service was really good and the young man that was waiting on us was on top of things but when it came down to the food, it was just ok. (At least the main course anyway) We ordered the onions rings as an appetizer and they were actually very good. The cornbread with the honey butter was pretty tasty as well. Now for our main course, we ordered the combo platter to share which had the chicken, pork ribs, beef ribs, brisket, pork shoulder and ham. I just remember the chicken which I think was pulled was dry, the ham being very salty, and the the ribs were fatty. :( bummer, but the sauce and the sweet potato were good.   Maybe it was just an off night, who knows, but I haven't been back since to give it another try. I really wanted to like this place especially after seeing it on Triple D and seeing all the awards he had won. There are other BBQ places in the area but unfortunately Thee Pitts Again is not one I would personally recommend.

This particular Arriba's is always dark. I have been here twice and the service is good, the chips are addictive and the food is yummy. Although I have never come during happy hour, I hear that there 99 cent margaritas are pretty good. I do know that their steak tacos and very well seasoned and delicious as well as their nachos. So if you are in the area, stop by and try during happy hour. Maybe one day I will finally make it. Also, turn on some lights!!! lol

It has been a really long time since I have been to the Elephant Bar and I was just there recently for a my friends Bachelorette /Bridal party. They were informed weeks prior that we were coming so it you would think they would have been a little bit more prepared. Sadly they were not. Although the staff were friendly enough, there just were not enough of them to take care of our party of 18 along with the other tables they had to take care of inside. There was one lonely bartender and unfortunately this person could not keep up with all the orders that were being thrown at them from us along with any other patrons in the restaurant. Any time it takes more than 30 mins (not kidding) to get a drink that you have repeatedly asked your server about, then its a problem. Especially when it is something simple like a glass of wine. The food took a long time to receive as well, but I will say it was pretty good once it arrived. Sadly some people were missing items with their orders, but they did say they enjoyed their meal once they got all the missing items.   IDK.. you let me down Elephant Bar. You knew we were coming and you were not prepared for us. Next time, try to be a little bit more prepared by having a few more servers and at least two bartenders on duty when you are expecting a big party. Better to be over-prepared instead of under-prepared.

WOW. I was here for a wedding this past Saturday night and and let me tell you it was very nice. The wedding ceremony was small and was held outside in a cute area that was quite hard to find but the staff were very helpful and friendly for someone that was very lost.   After the ceremony, we walked over to our private area for the cocktail hour before the dinner. Again another nice area and it was the perfect size for this very small and very cozy wedding. The dinner was buffet style and was very good. My favorite dish were these steak medallions with risotto. I actually went back for a little more because it was so good. YUM! Needless to say I had a great time at the wedding and the Sheraton Wild Horse really did a great job making my friends day extra special!

I finally got a chance to come to the original location. It was late on a Thursday night. Like 8ish late and the fabulous Dottsy decided she wanted some chicken and waffles. So off we went to get their before they closed. This place is small and quaint and I can see how the lines are around the corner on the weekend. Get in and get out people lol. The staff were friendly and the food was delicious as always. Plus they were playing some jams while we enjoyed our food and they didn't rush us at all even though they were closed by the time we were done. If I am ever back on this side of town, I just may have to stop in and get my fried chicken and waffle fix.

I will give 5 stars for seating because no matter where you sit you can see the stage clearly and they have screens as well. just to make sure you see everything. The drinks are made strong which one may need if a show is running 30-45 mins late. Parking/and leaving were a non issue as they have that down to a science. I may come back again to.see if a show actually starts on time lol but all in all not a bad place.

Now although I am not a fan of the location on Dunlap, I am a fan of the location on Camelback. I am not sure if they are run by the same people however at this location you do not need to turn your purse in at the door before you are allowed to look around the store. However their staff is walking around and checking on things to help deter any theft which is great!  I shop at this location from time to time as its a little bit closer than their competition and alot smaller. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable and their selection of products for black women is not quite as large as their competition but all in all not bad. So if you are looking for another beauty supply besides Sally's check out this particular United Beauty Supply location.

I have been coming to this Goodwill since I moved over here into my house back in 2010. This place get's me everytime! Especially on 50% off Saturdays. I have bought more purses, household items, books, picture frames, etc than I probably should have, but the prices just can't be beat. Heck I even got two stools for a total of $14. If you happen to be in the area check this place out. On 50% off Saturdays, it get's really crazy, but you get some great stuff for EXTRA cheap!

I just realized I did not review this place when I visited back in June of 2012.  See, I had my first  official date here way back then with my now  fiancé. For kicks and giggles, we decided to go back to where it all began. We even sat in the same booth and order the same meal ( me being fish tacos and him being the baja burrito) . We ate so many chips and salsa that I was surprised that we actually at our meal but the food was as good as I remember. The waitress, Brandi was awesome but I must say that the company I was with was fabulous and it was so much fun reminiscing about our first date. Tons of fun revisiting and I know we will be back again soon.

I have been coming to Ramiro's since last October when a friend of mine said, hey lets grab a breakfast burrito! OMG! it was so good! Packed full of yummy goodness to the point that I have been back many times just for the breakfast burritos alone. Fast track to their nachos, regular burritos, tacos, you name it, I have tried it and it was delicious. Like Ashley said, this place isn't a "Berto's" by any means, they are better! I have and will continue to come back for more!

I cannot believe I have not written a review for this place yet. It is literally around the corner from my house and I have been quite often. The service is great and the pizza is delicious. Now granted everyone that calls Sardella's, I am sure  their number ultimately locked in but I always feel special when I call and  they are like "Hey Eb, how are you? Are you getting your usual order"? lol.  I especially love their Monday deals in which some of pizzas are 50%. Score! Although one of my favorites is a the large meat lovers for about $12 (not included in the Monday special) It is meaty and delicious! Lord knows how many times I have ordered that one.  So if you happen to be in the neighborhood and you are craving pizza and wings, stop in to this location. I promise you won't be disappointed!

I love coming to this beauty supply as it's a pretty good size and they have lots to choose from. Wigs to weaves, to braid hair to pony tails. You name it they got it. Plus just about every hair care product you can think of that caters to black woman. So if you are looking for a good beauty supply and live on the West side, check out Mid -K.  Heck I drive from North Phoenix to this location because the staff are friendly and very patient and because again, they have everything one would need to change up their hairstyle.

"If you buy a cha cha mug, you know it is refillable for cheap?" SCORE! I have my mug in my car just in case I happen to go to another Macayo's just so that I if I happen to go to one, I know my drink will be around $3.99 tops lol. The chips and salsa are always hot and fresh. The service was great and the food has never disappointed. Our bartender was great and made sure to check on us often and kept our drinks refilled.. alot. I will definitely visit this location when I come back to the West side to visit friends!

Yummy, Yummy Rolls! Yep, that along with one of my best girlfriend's birthdays convinced me to drive all the away across town. (I would have done it for her regardless but still, the rolls were a plus) I wasn't really hungry but I did order the veggie plate in which I got a salad, two sweet potatoes (one loaded) and some sauteed mushrooms for about $8.00. I thank my lovely waitresses who's name escapes me right now :( for letting me know it would be cheaper to order it that way instead of how I was a going to order. I ended up only eating the salad and taking everything else, along with about 4 rolls home with me. ( Greedy much? yep)  It was a great evening, the staff were great, including convincing my friend to get up on the saddle to have the entire restaurant wish her a happy birthday (so embarrassing) but she had a blast and that was all that matters :)

This was the first apt complex I live in when I moved here from VA. I moved into this place site unseen and was pretty happy with the results. I lived on the first floor and the only problem I had at first was were earwigs / bugs. There was alot of construction going on right near us and all that shifting of dirt made the bugs happy campers as they came out in droves. Annoying little suckers, but after they did thorough spray and fumigation in not only my apt but in their drains  and other places as well, I never saw a earwig or a bug in my apt again.   The rent was cheap, the staff were great, the apt was fabulous. I never had any problems with my neighbors except that right before I moved, some new next door neighbors moved and man were they loud. I mean really, did you have to play your playstation that loud? Really? Or did your movie have to be heard down the street? It sounded like I was in the room with them as I could hear the games and movies loud and clear.  The only reason I moved was due to the fact that I lived too far away from my job. Driving 70 miles roundtrip can takes it toll, otherwise I would probably still be there but in a two bedroom.  So if you live in the west valley, check them out. You just may be pleasantly surprised.

The reason I am not happy with this place and will NEVER BE BACK to this location is due to the fact that they kinda treat you like a criminal before you even enter the store. Now before I get hate emails let just say yes I did see the sign that said NO PURSES ALLOWED, ONLY WALLETS AND KEYS. I was like huh? I was just at their Glendale location which had the same sign posted, yet EVERYONE (and when I say everyone I mean the 5 ladies that were in the store) had their purse on their shoulder and I do see a lady in this store with her purse as well and I did just come from their Glendale location, hmmm... so you can't be serious right? I mean no purse? What?   WRONG!!! I go in and although the young lady behind the counter was friendly enough she did say I am sorry but you are not allowed to bring in your purse. You can however leave it with me and place it in a box behind the counter but you are not going to be able to walk around with it. I was like are you kidding me? You want me to leave my purse with some stranger while I walk around your store? She stated that they have had too many thefts so therefore she had been told to take all purses and bags  from customers as they entered the store. I was like ok but if that is the case what about the other lady that is in the store with her purse. She was like oh  hmm ok and proceeded to ask the lady AFTER THE FACT (I am not going to point out the obvious on this one). Needless to say that customer said I am not leaving my purse with you and walked out and I did the same.   I am sorry that your store is having a theft problem but maybe if some of your staff walked around and were not sitting behind the counters, that may help. Don't treat everyone like criminals and make sure to that if you are going to enforce the rule, make sure to enforce this rule with EVERYONE and not just some. Its like going to Walmart and they say " I am sorry but you will have to leave your purse with me while you shop and when you are ready to check out then you can get it back" Hmm no.   So Chris and Sue Lee, I know its your business and you can run it any way you want but just make sure to be fair to everyone and not just some and make sure that if you are going to have a rule like NO PURSES OR BAGS ALLOWED to enforce it at both stores. As I stated yes I did see the sign that was posted but after coming from your Glendale location and seeing the (5) ladies in that store with their purses before I even entered, I didn't think anything of it ( and yes I had my purse their too and was never questioned) Not all your customers are criminals and it shame that you have to treat us like such.

This was so much fun. I bought a groupon as I know how much my dad likes to be on the water, so what better way to show him parts of AZ. Who knew we had water lol.  The tour was gorgeous albeit chilly if you were sitting outside, but so worth it. The Captain did a great job of giving us the history if the surrounding area. I will definitly bring my mom here when she visits in the spring.

I met with my girl Kira here for reverse happy hour after seeing a movie across the street.  You gotta love their reverse happy hour deals as they are just as good as happy hour. We ordered the chicken skewers, crab crunch roll, crab special roll, and the bama... Hey what you can say I was hungry. The rolls were ok except for the crab special roll. It was so salty. I mean I was like is it just me or is the super salty? Kira tried a piece as well and she was like wow, yea that is a little over salty. I asked our fabulous waiter about it and he kindly said would you like to order a california roll instead and I will take the crab roll off? Really? wow thank you. So i pushed that other roll to the side and devoured the rest (hey I told you I was hungry) and enjoyed great convo and food with Kira. Everyone was really nice, and the food, with the exception of the salty crab special roll was yummy. I will definitely be back again soon.

OMG! I am still full from pigging out on pizza, wine, and more pizza. If you left that place hungry after this event then that was your own fault because the food was endless!! Endless!!!!  See The AZWinebats and Grazie were hosting a wine event that was only $20 for 8 wine tastings and endless amounts of pizza and salads.  I started off with a free sampling of the Bruschetta Salsiccia, which was Italian Fennel Sausage with Melted Provolone Bruschetta YUM! I then had another bruchetta that was a cream cheese base with some sweet carmelized onions, red peppers, and seasonings which was equally as good as the Bruschetta Salsiccia. From there I moved on to the fabulous pizza that varied from the Margherita, Vegetariana, Americana, and Toscana. With all that pizza plus the yummy salads that they had to choose from where were the Emiliana and the Cesar, see now you realize why I am still full. I pigged out like there was no tomorrow. The Vegetariana won me over because of the sweet carmelized onions. Double yum!  The wine tasting was pretty good with my favorite being the one from Bigi called the Orvieto Amabile. It was a sweet white wine and that is just how I like my white wines. My next favorite was the Rosso di Podernovo from Castello Dell Regine and rounding it out with the Sangiovese Riserva from Umbeito Cesari being my favorite red and was also the last one on the list. The one that I did not like was the Brut Rose from Hello Kitty. Not a favorite but hey you can't like them all now can you?  My favorite part of the day was the fact that my friend Mark T. surprised me by coming to this event. Especially since he lives way in the middle of BFE!! LOL sorry Mark. But seriously, it was a great surprise and I was so very happy that he was there. Mark you rock!!  The owner was fantabulous, the staff were fantabulous, the food was fantabulous, the company was AMAZING!!! (thank you again Mark)What can I say, I am a happy and very full woman. (hmm pizza and wine drool....)  PS! The next event is Feb 28, so if you are in the area, by all means check it out. For $20, you can't beat it!

I have never been to The Phoenician and I had the opportunity to come here for the 1n10 brunch event. Wow, this place is beautiful. The staff were extremely friendly and this may sound retarded, but there bathrooms are beautiful! The grounds were gorgeous and although the drinks were on the high side, at least they made the strong. I may just have to come back and try dinner.

Its been awhile since I have visited Furio but there Monday night martini and manicures are the best. The martini's are special priced and the appetizers are very yummy. I also had the pleasure of having dinner there awhile back and the food was really good. Definitely give this place a try whether its for happy hour or for special date. You won't be disappointed.

We had our company xmas party at the roaring fork last year and I must say that it was a pretty good spread. We had the back room all to ourselves which was really nice, and we had tons of appetizers as we mingled and chatted with drinks in hand. What the appetizers were, I do not remember, but I do remember that it was alot of food.   Next we were seated for dinner and mind you I was a little stuffed from the appetizers but alas I took one for the team and made sure to partake in dinner. We had a caesar salad to start, I ordered the filet mignon and of course the chocolate brownie for dessert. We also had a huge bowl of the mac and cheese to share at the table and I tell you that was some good mac and cheese. Cheesy and spicy! What more can a girl ask for.  Will have to go and visit that place again soon.

Sweet baby Jesus!! I was here this past Saturday with the lovely Miss Jill C. We wanted to do our annual picnic but alas the weather was acting funny so we decided to head over for some yummy Thai food since that is what I was currently craving.  It was pretty empty for a Saturday afternoon, but then again they do not offer the lunch specials I have heard so much about on the weekends and sushi is not available until 6pm. Sad to say the least, but it did not deter us. We ordered some veggie spring rolls to share and after looking over the menu, can you believe all I ended up ordering was Pad Thai? Sad but that is what I really wanted. Jill ordered a yummy curry dish that had me wishing I had ordered some Panang but no worries as there will be a next time. OMG! The portions were HUGE. From the biggest veggie spring rolls I have ever seen to the massive portion of Pad Thai. I was in food heaven. Of course after a few bites I was like ok, time to wrap it up because I just couldn't eat anymore, but let me just say that the next day, my leftovers were spectacular. Especially since I had my Pad Thai extra, extra, extra spicy. Yummy indeed. Of course we washed it all down with some yummy Thai iced tea. I mean with all that spice, you need something cool to help soothe your tongue right.  I will definitely try to make it to one of the locations for their lunchtime special but in the meantime, if you are craving some Thai, definitely check this place out. You will not be disappointed.

A friend of mine took me out here for a belated birthday dinner. I have always wanted to try this place so it was a welcome surprise. We were seated on the patio since it was a nice evening however me being the wimp that I am, I had them turn on the heater because it was a little cooler than I thought ( plus it didn't help that I had a a very thin top but that is another story lol)  We ordered Mai Tai's for our drinks and let me tell you those suckers were strong. Luckily for me I was not driving and my dinner companion sipped his sparingly. We had the Mexican Potstickers as an appetizer however although they were good, they were quite salty.  I ordered the Crab Stuffed Poblanos as my main course and my friend ordered Chorizo Stuffed pork chop. Baby, my Poblanos were stuffed with so much crab!! OMG it was soo good. They were huge as well So big that I even after sharing I ended up taking one whole one and a half one home with me. My friend's stuffed pork chop was delicious and the red chile cheddar mash potatoes had just the right kick. He too ended up taking half his meal home because the portion was so good. Oh and if you think I am complaining, believe me I am NOT by any means. I also ordered a pina colada later on (as again I was not driving) and that too was just as strong. They do not skimp on the alcohol and I was very happy about that.  Nothing like spending $9 on a drink and you can't taste any alcohol.  Now although were were stuffed to the gills, we also ordered a piece of key lime pie to share. Delicious to say the least. With the exception of the ultra salty mexican pot stickers, the serve, the food, and most importantly the company was fantastic. If I am ever in the area again, I may have to check out there happy hour.

I have been to the Keg a total of three times with the last one being this past Sunday evening, and each time I go, I am never disappointed however there was this one time, where my food came out cold  (and I don't mean lukewarm, I mean cold!) which was the oddest thing, so odd that the chef came out and apologized to me, made me a totally different dish, and then the meal was comped!  WOW!  The staff is ultra friendly and never overbearing and the food and drinks are great. When in doubt of when to go, go on a Sunday evening  after 7pm as never overly busy and you will be seated right away. Give this place a try, you will not be disappointed.

I swear I had one of the best Reuben sandwiches ever. It was packed with corned beef, sauerkraut, and Swiss cheese layered between two buttery rye slices and thousand island dressing on the side. Along with hot crispy french fries. Man I was in caloric heaven LOL. I could only eat half of my sandwich as it really was packed with all of the above. My coworkers all seemed to enjoy their meal with majority of them getting the special of the day which was a roast beef sandwich in which the roast beef was piled high between some of the biggest buttery croissants I have ever seen. Another coworker got the chicken strip salad and while three more got the chicken avocado sandwich. I am telling you, they did not skimp on the servings that is for sure.   The prices were decent for lunch and service was fantabulous. I will definitely be coming back again and trying dinner soon.

On Friday, our company decided we needed a much needed break so we headed over to Willow Stream Spa at the Fairmont some R&R. I mean since my company made me go I just had to oblige as I couldn't disappoint them.   We started off with a lovely lunch in the Spa area. I had the cobb salad which was pretty good but the quinoa crab cakes and the curry chicken wraps looked divine and I should have gotten that instead .  We also did some laughing yoga, which unfortunately I did not see the point nor was I a fan however my coworkers seemed to have gotten a kick out of it. They are weird bunch so they tend to like anything.  Although I do not remember our main hostess' name, I do remember Miss Theresa who made sure we knew the ins and outs of the lovely spa area and OMG what a massive Spa area this place has. From the fitness center, to the water fall, to the jacuzzi, to the steam rooms,  to the showers from heaven to everything in between. Followed by the rooftop pool where Patrick and Andrew made sure our drinks kept coming and were plenty strong. Man this place was impressive.  However the massage that Miss Lark gave me had me about to to pass out it was so relaxing. Seriously this place is top notch and the prices are very reasonable should you decide to come on your own. Which believe me, I will definitely be back again soon. Thank you to the entire staff at Willow Stream Spa for taking such good care of us for our Wellness day. You went above and beyond and we couldn't have been happier.

I love Annie! Seriously that woman works miracles. I have been to her twice now, once in October of 2008 and just this past October. Both times have been for a bridesmaids dress (you see a pattern? lol) and both times she made sure that my dress fit me like a glove.  The purple dress that is in my profile pic is the one that Annie just recently altered and let me tell you, I swear I didn't think I would fit that dress. One day it was too big, next day it was too small, but after taking it to Annie, she made sure that no matter when I put it on, it would always fit just right and did it EVER!   If you are ever in need of alterations, run to Annie. Like the reviewer Kirin said, "Annie is bluntly honest" but she will make you look like a million bucks!

Me and my friend Jill were trying to figure out what we were going to eat at our annual fall picnic and we decided to grab some sandwiches over at Cheba Hut. All I can say is wow, very interesting place.   As a few other reviewers have stated, the owner of this place definitely has a niche in the market on how he explains his sandwiches. Very creative. I ordered the 8 inch Chronic which was thinly sliced roast beef, BBQ sauce, green bell peppers, mushrooms & cheddar cheese. The place reminded me of Quiznos as the sub is toasted and you can add or subtract whatever you want on your sub once it is done with the toasting process. I added a touch of ranch, some pickles and some lettuce. Not too shabby. I also got a huge chocolate chip cookie that I have yet to eat as the sandwich was very filling. Although the place was full, we did receive our orders pretty quickly and was out the door headed to our picnic in no time.   So if I am ever in the Tempe area and craving a sandwich, I just may have to stop by and grab me an "illegal" sub over at Cheba Hut. The staff are very friendly and it is a pretty cool place.

I stopped by here last night for a friends going away party. (sniff sniff) Cute little place. The drinks were good (Southern Peach gets a thumbs up from me) and like everyone said, the fish and chips are YUMMO!!! I had the sweet potatoes fries with my fish and everything was scrumptious. They even had spicy ketchup, which is a rare find. Either I was hungry or it was really good because I could have licked my plate if I was allowed.  We also ordered a side of the the mac and cheese, which was just ok, only because we didn't know that it had ham in it and it made the mac and cheese taste very salty so I only had a bite or two. ( We didn't see it on the menu but we saw that someone else had ordered it hence the reason we ordered it.) I think without the ham, it would  have been pretty ok.  So with that said, great food, fabulous company, a little eye candy here and there, what more could a girl ask for?

I have only been here once for a bachelor / bachelorette auction and let me tell you I felt so bad for some of those people, especially the one bachelor that didn't get any offers. Ouch. The food was decent and the people were nice, although I am sure they were kinda wondering what the blazes I as doing there lol. I was even asked if I was going to be on the auction block that night. Hmm I wonder how much if any I would have raised for charity. Ah the world will never know.

I went to Gandhi's  while in Vegas with a friend of mine from high school back in July. If you don't know where this place is, chances are you probably won't find it as it is hidden within a strip mall and you would think it was closed down if you didn't know any better.  We were seated immediately as it appeared that my friend knew everyone in the place. Everyone made sure to come over and say hello and to constantly check on us all evening. I actually felt like a celebrity with all the attention we were getting. Anyway enough about that, onto the food.  We ordered the Paneer Pakora which was homemade deep fried cottage cheese, Gosht Vindaloo, and the Chicken Makhanwala along with tons of Nan. I was in Indian food heaven. The lamb was cooked to perfection and the Chicken had a nice blend of spices and the sauce was divine! I am sitting here licking my lips still remembering just how good it was.   This place is a nice little hidden gem that you should really try if you are ever in Vegas. You do realize that it means you will have to explore outside of the strip so venture if you dare :)

Very nice hotel. I stayed here back in April while myself and my girlfriends ran the Super Spartan. Our room was huge to be a one bedroom. There was a full kitchen, two bathrooms and even the pullout bed was comfy (per my friends) the master bathroom was AMAZING! I mean the tub itself gets 4 stars. Parking can be a little tricky if the place was full (which it was) but were lucky enough to score great parking while we were there. They do try to sell you a time-share presentation when you first check-in which I am not a fan of, but I do understand they have to do what they have to do. The bar/restaurant area was nice but the service was a little slow. All in all, if I am in need of a room not on the strip, I will definitely look into booking this room again. Oh and fyi, we were able to do our laundry for FREE after our race so we didn't have to take home wet clothes and they even provided laundry detergent. Double score!

Review # 300... Might as well start it with a BANG! A friend of mine called me on Friday night and asked me if I wanted to go to a baseball game as he had free tickets, in a suite, that was inclusive. SCORE! I mean to think, I am don't even like baseball but what the heck, why not I mean  free food and drinks, oh yea I am in!  We arrived and parking was a breeze. I mean yea it was $12 to park in the garage, but it was right next to Chase Field and we did have free tickets. So we go to will call to pick up the tickets, stand in line and walk on in. This is where it gets slightly confusing. The suite was Legends E and for some reason, no one knew exactly where it was. They knew it was upstairs but not sure where. So after walking upstairs and seemingly walking in circles for a minute, we finally found a staff member who knew where we were talking about and pointed us in the right direction.   OMG the suite was huge! There were sections for you to sit down outside as well as inside to watch the game. The food buffet was plentiful with some of the largest (and yummiest) hot dogs I have ever seen. Oh and the kicker ( besides the open bar) was that they even had an ice cream bar. What the hell? #team greedy was in full effect that night lol.  So we grab some hot dogs and drinks and park ourselves in some seats to watch the game. Now I know what goes on during those commercial breaks. Between the kiss cam, in which someone got engaged, to the the funny little games they play. Very cool and quite comical.  I do feel as though I may have jinxed the Diamondbacks as they lost and lost badly to the Braves that night, but all in I had a very good time. Even for someone who doesn't watch/like baseball. Oh will I go back? Sure and it doesn't even need to be in a suite!

So I finally gave  Sapporo a try last month as was shocked that I actually enjoyed myself. Besides the fabulous friends that I was with, the drinks were really good (That Mango Martini is wow!) I had order the bbq ribs as an appetizer to share and they were decent. The sushi we ordered was plentiful and very good. There were 8 of us and we spent about 24 dollars total with tip. Not to bad considering we went on a Saturday during happy hour and the amount of Martini's we had with dinner. All in all I will definitely return.

Hmm I have been to AZ88 more than twice. Weird that it doesn't show a review from me either. At any rate, I love the atmosphere of this place. Music pumping, conversations flowing, martinis overflowing, food is delicious and the waiters are fabulous. Getting a seat can be tricky so come early or you will be waiting in the wings looking at everyone else enjoying their martinis (which they really do fill to the brim and I spill every.single.time.without.fail.) It is also a place to see and be seen (as I have observed on my numerous times, quite funny actually) You won't be disappointed!

It is strange that I don't have a review for them, and yet I have been here every year that I have had my Cosmoprof North America tradeshow for our annual girls night( a total of 7 times and counting) There are usually 7 to 10 of us lovely and we take a seat on the patio to people watch and enjoy a beverage ( or three) of sorts. The food is delicious! DELICIOUS! From the warm brie to the goat cheese to the steaks, to the pomme frittes, to the desserts. Sweet baby jesus you can't go wrong at this place. It seems that the drinks get stronger and stronger as the night progresses so w are usually fat, full, tired, and tipsy But no matter what, we always have a great time! See you next year ( if not sooner)

My mom insisted on this being her first stop when she arrived in Phoenix. She saw it on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and she loved the concept. So off we went. It does look like a dive, but it was clean and that is what matters the most. The young lady behind the counter was the most patient woman ever and let us try just about everything so that we could make up our minds as to what we wanted. I have no idea what they put in those refried beans, but baby they are some good eats. I could have had a bowl of that with the jerk fried rice and I would have been happy. My mom wanted a little bit of it all, so ordered a carnita burrito, jade chicken, beans, and jerk fried rice. I kept it simple with just the jerk fried rice and the jerk chicken. (Hey I was already full from all the samples, don't judge me) Everything was so good. We had left overs the for lunch the next day. Mom was extremely pleased and needless to say that on her next visit, we will be back again!

I love staying at THEhotel. It is my most favorite place to stay on the LV Strip. I mean the room is spacious, its like a mini apartment. Two bathrooms, spacious living room, bedrooms and bathroom is heaven! I try to stay here as often as possible, provided I can afford it. Sometimes I have been lucky enough to get upgraded to one of these rooms and believe me, I am always in heaven when that happens. IF you get a chance to stay here, you will not be disappointed. Yes it is a hike to get to the casino, the beach area, the restaurants, but it is well worth it!

I have been to the Foundation Room numerous times over the years while visiting Vegas and Mandalay Bay. It is quite a large area as there are many rooms you can sneak off too, provided you are on the VIP list or possibly know the right people. The view of the strip is awesome and that is what most people come up here for. The cost of drinks are quite steep, but it is Vegas and it is the Foundation Room, but just be prepared. It would be a great date night for you and the special someone, especially on the slower nights which are usually Tuesday/Wednesday.

Every time I am in Vegas and stay at the Mandalay bay (especially when I am here for work), I always stop in for a breakfast or one of their mega desserts as I am headed god knows where. The all american breakfast is my go to dish as it has everything I need, eggs, bacon, toast, potatoes, coffee and juice. Score. For $16 you can't beat that. It get's to the point that when I am here for work, I stop in every morning, the staff pretty much knows my order before I even place it. ( I mean I am here for week and I never change the order lol) I have to give them props for that.  I will say this, when it gets super busy, the wait is a little long, so you must have patience. They go as fast as they can to get you taken care of and the food comes out pretty quickly once you have ordered. IF all else fails order take out.

Happy hour from 2-6 every day! Hello! They don't have anything on Draft, but the drink selection is not all that bad. I mean $3 bottles and $5 drinks. Not to shabby. Plus the food ranges from $3-6 during happy hour ( I believe) so it is not all bad. The jalapeno cornbread is yummy and served to you in a small cast iron skillet. The steak quesadillas were filled to capacity with yummy steak and cheese. I do think my favorite was the bbq pork sliders. Yummy and nicely priced. ( Plus cannot believe I had not written a review about them until now SMH!)

Eli's, Eli's, Eli's. I must admit that I don't go as often as I use to but I do go and check in on my favorite bartenders from time to time. I use to frequent this place quite a bit, but mostly to people watch because some of the things I witnessed WOW! LOL!!. Yes it is an older crowd, but they have never been rude or snobbish to me EVER! Heck if anything they are overly friendly and always trying to pull me one the dance floor, (Ladies and men alike). The food here is really good and the drinks are great , plus I do enjoy myself everytime I have stopped by. The band that plays there is also pretty decent as well and they are there most nights. Oh and the bartenders will call you a cab and take your car keys away if  you have had one too many. That has never happened to me but I have witnessed it quite often.   So all I can say go to Eli's, enjoy the food, enjoy the drinks, enjoy the music, and people watch. IT will be worth it!

50% off wine on Sundays. Sold! I have been a couple of times and the service and food is ALWAYS fabulous. There hummas is some of the best that I have ever had. If you are ever in the area on a Sunday evening, run to The Greene House! The have a special on wine all day long and believe me, when you are catching up with a girlfriend, wine and appetizers go hand in hand. Plus they don't kick you out when you are the last patrons in the restaurants. Heck we were even able to order dessert as they were cleaning and they did it without batting an eye and with smile, even though they were truly ready to go :)

For the love of Jesus! I went here with miss Dottsy Z for our girls date night and omg this place is fantastic! I have been here one other time 6 years ago on a blind date and had forgotten just how good the food was.   We started off with the ever popular Burrata, which is- fresh mozzarella with a creamy heart topped with a balsamic glaze served with black label prosciutto crudo and toasted bread. From what I understand it is goats milk cheese that is flown in fresh daily and they have limited quantities. To say this is like butter is an understatement. It was delicious!!!!! Next I ordered the Rustica which is mozzarella, topped with prosciutto crudo and arugula after pizza is cooked. It took everything in me not to eat the entire damn pizza. Dottsy ordered the Prosciutto Crudo which is similar except hers has red sauce and no arugula. My goodness. I am still shaking my head and kicking myself for giving Dottsy all the leftovers. What in the world was I thinking? I will be back again very soon and not wait 6 years for another visit.

Its been over a year since I was last at Fez but I remember all the fun I had. Believe it or not it was Gay Rodeo week I believe and let me tell you, those were some very cute cowboys. Yum.  Anywhoo, It as an impromptu date night and we wanted to try out a new place and FEZ just happened to come up on a list of restaurants we were looking at. So we ventured over and the place was packed but we were able to find a spot at the bar. The bartender was really sweet and she helped me decide on what drink I should choose, after letting me sample a few (who does that?) So I decided on a pomegranate martini which was very yummy and quite strong. We ordered some appetizers and no sooner did we do that place at the couches became open. So we grabbed a spot and noshed on some yummy apps which of course included the sweet potatoe fries which are sinful as long as they are cooked just right.   But the kicker to this story is that we ended up getting a surprise (free) dessert as one of those cute cowboys I mentioned earlier thought I was adorable as well. Who knew! The guy that I was with thought it was pretty cool as well but he did hold me just a little tighter after that lol.   Yes FEZ is a really great place to go and just hang out. The food is good, the bartenders are generous and it is just alot of fun!

Cheap drinks, great burgers, great guitarist, cool people! If this place wasn't so far away I would be a regular. It really is a cool place to go and chill. Skip really was kick ass on his guitar and the fire pits kept you nice and toasty. I will definitely have to venture back one day soon.

This Chipotle is down the street from my job. I don't come very often but the day that I did come it was packed as always. Like others have stated arking is very limited so I always park in the first space that I see regardless to how far away it is. I mean I am about to eat Chipotle so I can walk my butt to from wherever I parked to get some food. Also avoid this place between 11:30am and 1:30pm because again it is packed and they run out of things from time to time so you may have to wait a little. The last time this happened to me, I was treated to a free meal because I waited a little longer than I was told for the chicken finish cooking. Quite unexpected but very nice of them. All in all, it is Chipotle. It is quick, fresh, and delicious. Kinda hard not to like it!

You gotta love free stuff!! So in continuance of my birthday freebies, I headed to Red Robin, where I had a coupon for a free gourmet burger. I had the pleasure of being served by Miss Bonlie and I have to give her a huge thank you for spoiling me today. You rock girly!   So after having Miss Bonlie patiently wait for me to decide which burger I would like, I decided on the Santa Fe burger which omg was amazing! So amazing that I ended up bringing half of it home because it was MASSIVE!!! My goodness. It had guacamole, fire roasted poblano peppers, yummy for my tummy sauteed onions, tortilla strips, pepper jack cheese, and chipotle mayo. Yup there was even lettuce in there somewhere too, But it gets even better, after not being able to take another bite and packing up my leftovers, Miss Bonlie brings out a free hot fudge sundae for my birthday too. Now yes they do that for everyone if you tell them its your birthday but man, I must admit, I felt pretty freakin special. Oh and I forgot to mention, I was dining alone :) So I got to people watch while people watched me. Pretty entertaining to say the least.   So Red Robin gets a major hats off for filling up my tummy with the yummy goodness of a great burger, all you can eat steak fries, and a hot fudge sundae to top it all off. This is one happy woman!

I decide to treat myself to dinner and I choose Fleming's as I had heard great things about this place. Wow! That is the best way to describe my experience here tonight. From the moment I walked in until the moment I left was great. Nick, my server was fantastic and attentive without being overbearing. Dillon, Nick's "assistant" was a sweetheart and the Manager Mark was awesome.   I ordered the prime rib special they currently have going on and it came without  salad, main course with a side as well as a dessert for $29.95. I like the end piece of the prime rib as I like to have a little bit of a crust. It came out medium rare just like I like it and the crust on the end was perfect. The sauteed green beans were just a delicious and as well as the Fleming's Salad. I could have had two of those as that salad  really was that good. I only ate half of everything (sans the salad) as I wanted to save room for dessert. I was so excited to try the Chocolate Lava cake and I waited with anticipation to receive it as they are made to order and it takes 20 mins. Sadly it was not all that great. It may have just been me but the chocolate was way to bitter for my taste. I have had quite a few different takes on the Chocolate Lava Cake and regretfully this one was not a favorite. I did enjoy the vanilla ice cream that was topped with fresh pistachios though so all was not lost. Nick, bless his heart was excited to ask me if it was a good as I remembered it and sadly I said no. He immediately offered to replace the dessert but I told him no as I really was full and I was very content with eating the ice cream.   If people watching during the week is anything like it was last night , then I will definitely be back again to try their happy hour, which is nightly from 5-7 in the bar area. It will give me chance to try some of their delicious appetizers and drinks for $6 each and of course to people watch :) Oh who am I kidding, I will be back regardless!

Why oh why have I waited so long to come here on a Friday night? You get a a fabulous little mini buffet that has tri tip, nachos, shrimp, cheese, and its free? Oh and the drink prices? Two very strong drinks, $4.50 each? What? Are you kidding me? Tons of people which makes for great people watching, great food, good happy hour prices? Again why did I wait so long? Oh I will be back. That is for certain.

I drive from North Phoenix/Scottsdale just to get my Famous Daves BBQ fix. Sad, yes but they make some hella good BBQ. The ribs are tender and juicy, the baked beans, the mashed tators, and the green beans are so good, they make you wanna smack yo momma. Well maybe not that good, but darn near close enough. Oh and don't forget about the the cornbread muffins. Always warm and yummy. See now I need my BBQ fix once again. Seriously though, I really do enjoy their food and their Devil's Spit BBQ sauce is on point! Make sure to try a skewer of shrimp or the BBQ wings. YUMMO!

Ikea how I love you so. Your prices are reasonable and most of your items are easy to put together, and some are a little more complicated. Your clearance can be hit or miss, but when you hit, you can grab the motherload of items for cheap and already assembled. Just don't make the mistake I did and buy a chest of drawers from clearance only to realize that it won't fit in your car. Luckily for me I was able to return the item, seeing as I had never left the property. Next time, I will have to bring a friend with a truck or a larger car.

Great place for a Superbowl or any sporting event(or any event)  for that matter. Parking is pretty easy even if you are parked across the street. Entering the stadium and finding your seat is again pretty easy. I am not even mad at the concession stand prices because they really are not that bad. However I do wish they had more cocktail stations at the Superbowl as not everyone likes beer. Oh and another huge perk, having plenty of ladies restrooms. I never waited more than 3 minutes. That in itself is worth 5 stars!!

I have been to this Maggiano's numerous times as well as had it catered at our offices, however this review is solely based on the service that we received today (March 10, 2010)   My company was hosting a going away luncheon for my lovely coworker Samantha, who is leaving us to go to France, but I will stop my ranting about that. BOOO! LOL Anyways back to Maggiano's. It started when we arrived. The hostess was chatting it up with a patron at the bar so we had to wait for her to finish up, now the reason why I am little disturbed as there were two other servers as well as someone who appeared to be a manager standing right by the hostess station. They looked at us, however they did not acknowledge us in the 3 mins we stood there waiting for the hostess to finish her conversation with the patron at the bar. FAIL!   Finally we were acknowledged and we were told where the rest of our party was. We were all seated and about 5 mins or so, drink orders were taken. 15 mins after the orders were taken and we received our drinks,(no I am not over exaggerating either) we get some bread baskets at each table, which was great because we were pretty famished. Fast forward another 15 mins and our appetizers arrived. Now mind you this menu was predetermined days ago so it wasn't like we had to wait for people to order and it was all going to be family style. Now although the appetizers were tasty, we had to wait about another 25 mins after that for the appetizers to be taken away and an additional 20 mins for the lunch to arrive. FAIL!   Now any other time, I would not have a problem if the place was jam packed, but it was not. See what they had failed to mention to us when we arrived is that a water main was broken in front of the restaurant so they no longer had running water. From what I understand, they had brought in more than enough water to get through the lunch rush, but they had called those who had reservations for dinner because they were closing down for the rest of the day due the water main problem. How the hell can you not tell your patrons that you don't have running water and the only way that you find out is because one of your coworkers happens to go to the bathroom and their is someone standing at the door to let you know that there is no running water but there are big coffee pots full of hot water for you to wash your hands however you cannot flush the toilet. WTF??! Great so now we had a better understanding as to why things were taking so long. Had they told us this before hand, I am sure we would have went somewhere else. Especially since we didn't find out until halfway into our meal. FAIL!   Maggiano's I am very disappointed in you today. Our company orders from you quite a bit and I understand that the only discount you gave is that you didn't charge us to take the leftover food back to three coworkers that couldn't make it. Seriously?! Yes I understand that there were circumstances out of your control, but as courtesy you should have told us what was going on and let us decide how to proceed. What should have been a quick 2 hour max lunch turned into a long 3+ hour lunch, which would have been ok any other time had their been working bathrooms. FAIL!   So like I said, this review is solely based on the service today. Any other time you would get at least 4 stars . Today you only get 1, and that is being generous. If someone from the restaurant happens to read this review, be careful if you decide to email me with "hate mail" because you know you guys were in the wrong today. FAIL! FAIL! FAIL!

Whoa momma! I am deathly afraid of heights so this one gave me a run for my money. The workout itself is FANTASTIC as long as you look at your feet going up and crab walk on some parts going down. Seriously!!!  I had a fantastic time and I know that I will be back again soon, that is as soon as I get over my fear of heights!

I finally visited this location last night as its been years since I have been inside of a buffalo wild wings. The food was great, but our waiter Levi was awesome. He made sure that we not only had great drinks but that our food arrived in a timely manner so that we would not miss our movie. How cool is that.? Great food, great drinks, fabulous service. What more could a girl want?

I must say that the company I was with made my experience pretty good hence the four stars. Plus I was hungry and the bartender was really sweet and the food was not bad at all.   We ordered some pan fried shrimp dumplings, the crab wontons, VIP Duck and the chicken with orange sauce. Everything was pretty tasty except the chicken with orange sauce or orange peel or orange whatever was too orangey (is that a word?) The duck was tender and not fatty like some places and the dumplings and wontons were really good with the sauces we had.   I do like the dessert menu they offer as they have $2.00 mini's that come in a huge shot glass. Too many to list here (sorry) but I ended up getting the cherry cheesecake and it was really, really good. My friend got the fried bananas they were wrapped like egg rolls and deep fried and came with four different dipping sauces and ice cream. Not too shabby. Top it off with some wine and good company and a girl is very happy.   So there you have it. You will either love it or hate it at PF Changs and on this particular night, I loved it.

Review # 100 and I saved it for Wildfish, how cool is that?  So Friday night, after taking my friend, who was here from DC,  to Scottsdale Fashion Square so she could see what this mall was all about, we decided to head over to Wildfish. I mean I was just their a few weeks ago and I remembered just how yummy the food was at the event so I just had to go back.  The place was packed! I mean it was Friday night so I didn't expect anything less but wow. We had two choices, to either wait 45 mins for a table or grab a table near the bar. We choose the latter as the you still received the full menu at the bar as well.  We were greeted pretty quickly and our waitress, Deanna took great care of us. Hats off to you Deanna! You rocked girl.  My friend started off with a raspberry mojito I believe (I am not sure but I think that is what it was), Lobster Bisque and Snapper with Crab, the crab fried rice to share and some steamed asparagus. All I wanted was the calamari  so I ordered that as my main course. I know lame but that is all I had a taste for as I was saving room for dessert too.  So her drink, some warm fresh bread, and the lobster bisque came pretty quickly.  After that we are not sure what happened. One of the waiters (who by the way remembered me from the yelp event) came over to see how our meal was and we told him that we hadn't eaten yet. No sooner did we say that did our meal finally arrive. We were not upset by the delay at all as we were catching up on old times but it was a pretty long wait. However the manager Mario came over to apologize about the delay and offered to by us dessert. How cool was that. Deanna also came over to apologize as well for not checking on us sooner.   The meal was so good. My friend enjoyed hers and I chowed down on all that yummy calamari. It was a huge plate that was sitting on top vegetables, red chiles and some yummy but spicy cashews. I also had some of that crab fried rice which was also very good. Lots of crab and lots of mushrooms. Yummy.  To save room for dessert we ate as much as we could but then requested to pack up the rest so that we could enjoy the grand finale.  OMG! The desserts are sinful. My friend ordered the upside pineapple cake made with fresh whipped cream and vanilla bean ice cream, and I had the chocolate godiva cake that was served warm with vanilla bean ice cream. Good lawd those desserts were good. If you don't want anything else from this restaurant. which shame on you for not trying the delicious food, at least go for dessert. Yum, yum, yum.  All in all it was a great time. Thank you again to Deanna and huge extra special thank you to Mario for generously buying us dessert. I will definitely be back again soon.

Shopping, shopping and more shopping. Need I say more? I mean you have places like Total Wine to Old Navy. Kirklands to Target. Albertsons to Kohls. So much to choose from. You have restaurants like The Keg (one of my favs) and Macaroni Grill. Oh and let's not forget Sweet Tomatoes.. Hmm Sweet Tomatoes. Seriously, there is something here for everyone. Check it out and like some have said, parking is usually very good.

I was craving some pad thai and I noticed this place when I was headed to the Arrowhead area. I will say that the staff were really friendly but the pad that was just ok. It was made with ramen noodles and not pad thai noodles. I asked for thai hot, and it was no where near hot, let alone thai hot. I will say that the eggrolls I got were very tasty, but the pad thai left much to be desired. I will give this place it another try to see if it was a fluke.

Great happy hour! Great food! Great service. Keep in mind that Tuesday night is seniors night so the average age of the guest are around 50 years old. But it was still a fun night. We were here celebrating my friends 40th birthday and even the cute little old men couldn't understand why all of us ladies were not there with any men. We simply stated that is was girls night out! LOL He then proceeded to say well if you ladies change your mind, please come and join me and my friends. Pure comedy indeed! Will I be back? Of course as this as this hasn't been my first visit ( hey I don't always check in lol) but it surely won't be my last!

Although I am fan of Fogo de Chao, this one was not so bad. The meats were tender and juicy and the sides were pretty good. Although I did not drink that night others did and let me tell you that the drinks were HUGE! You definitely get your $10.95 worth and will only need one. YOWZA!

It has been awhile since I have visited the Dubliner. The only reason I haven't frequented the place lately is because I don't live near them anymore so I can't just either walk home or call a cab for 5 min ride. However there drinks are strong and cheap! Either that or the bartender was being very friendly on the few times I have visited :) The food is not to shabby either. I mean you can't possibly mess up fish and chips. Hmm fish and chips. So go, check it out, but remember if you have too many, call a cab. Did I mention that their drinks are strong and cheap! #winwin!

Wow! I have finally been able to visit Ocean Club and it was well worth it.   For starters, I got there just in time to snag a parking spot right out front (Thank you parking fairies). The hostess immediately sat us even though our entire party had not arrived yet ( double score as most places won't do that)   Our server's name was Darian, and at first I thought he was in a bad mood because he appeared not happy with me when I asked for a black napkin instead of blurting out my drink order first. However I had him laughing and joking with me by the end of the night and realized whatever was gone on earlier in the evening had nothing to do with me :) Score one for Darian :)   Drinks - Pomegranate Martini - Good lord it was good and pricey. But you pretty much do get two drinks in one and I was practically trying to break the shaker trying to get every last drop. (Darian even showed me a few tricks to make sure I got every last drop thank you!)   Appetizers - we ordered the seafood tower and it had lobster, crab, shrimp and oysters. Plus we had a side of steamed mussels. I was in seafood heaven. Everything was so good. I practically ate all of the steamed mussels myself. Heck it was a meal in itself lol.   Main course - Chilean Sea Bass. Could anything be any more flakier and melt in your mouth good? Cooked to perfection and it was HUGE!   Sides - we had the gorgonzola mac and cheese, sauteed spinach, and my all time favorite roasted brussel sprouts. Those that know me know I love me some brussel sprouts, so needless to say, that side was all mine. OMG! Roasted to perfection and oh so good. I actually ate more brussel sprouts then the sea bass. (What can you say I love Brussel sprouts)   Dessert - There is always room for dessert and I ordered the warm butter cake. It was like sweet cornbread with fresh berries, ice cream and fresh whip cream on the side. Luckily I was sharing that with two other people because it was huge. A great way to top off the night. Oh by the way, another friend ordered the layer cake. Let's just say that was the biggest slice of cake I have ever seen in one serving. It could have easily fed a family of 4-6 lol. WOWZA!   Very nice place and I am sure when I will be back again one day. But until then, I will remember how lovely the evening was by eating all the yummy leftovers :)

Wow this place has really gone downhill since I moved here back in 2006. There are not a lot of stores left in this Mall and I am not sure you can really call it a Mall anymore. Some of the stores that are still there even close early. It is sad as it used to be a pretty popular location. Now the pickings are slim :(

Three words: Duck Fat Fries!! Dear lawd. They are heaven! And they were on the happy hour menu. Me and the girls met up with another friend and one of my friends sister to catch up and we picked STRIPSTEAK. We also order the Lobster Grilled Cheese with tomato soup, crabcakes, onion rings, truffled mac and cheese, and scalloped potatoes with goat cheese and caramelized onions. Yes it seems like alot of food but there were 5 of us and we had also had a few cocktails so we were hungry. Believe me, they were all DIVINE!!! I cannot wait to get the chance to go back and have dinner because I know that that will be a treat in itself.

What a cute little place that I never knew existed. I arrived there on Monday night for UYE that Miss Dottsy put together for us. The best part about it was that they had no idea that we were coming. They accommodated us even though we caught them by surprise and we told them there would be at least a group of 15 of us. No problem!! The owners were so personable and the waitress we had OMG. Her name was Linda but I called her "Bubbles" because that woman has a very, VERY bubbly personalty and she made it a point to remember all our names all night.   Now their were a few pros and cons.....   Pros  It was Monday night so the burgers were only $4.00. Although I didn't have one of my own, the bite that I did take was delicious and everyone said that they were good and juicy!   The owners were super friendly. They even bought us a round of beer and gave us each a shot of Ouzo! (I had to declined but wow!!! You could smell the Ouzo seeping from our group lol)   Happy hour prices are really great!! You can't go wrong here.   Linda made sure everyone had separate checks without us even asking. Double score for that one.   I was with a great group of yelpers. Definite plus.   Cons  Parking is a little difficult because the parking is small. But hey that just means you have to get there early!   Their was a weird smell upon arriving. From what I understood, thier had been a back up earlier that day that had been fixed but the smell lingered for awhile. It almost made me leave because it was a little overwhelming. As the night progressed, it did air out.   The area we were in, was very nice until it got dark. There was only one light in that area and made it very bright, but only on one side of the table   The food that people ordered (aka the burgers) came out in weird spurts and some had to wait a ridiculously long time for their food. It was weird but not a huge deal. But it is still a con.   Now will I go back? Absolutely. It really is a nicely hidden gem of a place.

I met my friend and her mom here tonight for dinner. We got here pretty early which was great because by the time we left, it was standing room early. Gotta love those early dinners :)   We were seated in the bar area and were promptly asked our drink order. When our first waiter arrived, he seemed friendly at first but when I asked him if the flirtini drink was any good, he proceeded to say " If it wasn't good it wouldn't be on the menu" We were like, that is not necessarily true but hmm ok. (Needless to say it was good though)   I ordered the plate of sliders which came with miniatures of the WCG Cheeseburger, BBQ Bacon Burger and Maytag Burger and french fries. I asked that my fries be made without salt because lately I have noticed that fries seem to be caked with salt. Needless to say that when my fries arrived they were COVERED in salt. Ewwww... I looked around and out of nowhere, our new waitress Tiffany (who was also manning the bar) came over and asked if everything was ok. I told her that I had asked for fries with no salt and she said lets just leave these here and I will get some fresh ones out to you. About 5 mins later this huge plate of piping hot no salt added fries arrived and needless to say I devoured all of them. Yes I know greedy but they were so good. Oh and the miniature burgers were yummy as well but ended up bringing home a mini because I was stuffed from all the fries.   My friend and her mom ordered the rotisserie Chicken Rotisserie Chicken Crêpes which were filled with rotisserie chicken, spinach and a mushroom cream sauce and topped with madeira sauce and parmesan cheese. They both said that it was really good. We also ordered the AZ egg rolls which were traditional egg rolls filled with spicy grilled chicken, corn, black beans and jack cheeses. They had a salsa dip and a jalapeno dip and they were quite yummy.   Now for dessert, my friend and her mom ordered white chocolate brownie to share. It had french vanilla ice cream, a warm white chocolate brownie, chocolate sauce and whipped cream with white chocolate shavings. I am not a fan of white chocolate but they both seemed to enjoy it.   So my experience at WCG was all in all a good one. I was with my fabulous friend and her adorable mom, plus Tiffany went above and beyond for us by just making sure we were ok. Hats off to you girl!

I got to meet up with Mandy and Anju , two lovely friends that I hadn't seen in forever, and we decided to go to Yard House as it has some pretty good happy hour specials. We go there just in time as happy hour was ending in 15 mins. We were seated immediately and ordered pretty quickly so that we could get those happy hour prices. We were pretty bummed that we were not allowed to order two drinks each those, (darn AZ laws) but end in the end it didn't matter because we could barely finish one. Sad, sad, sad lol.  We ordered a ton of stuff. Classic sliders, chicken nachos, spinach cheese dip and moo shu egg rolls. WOW! This is what happens when you go somewhere and you are hungry and your eyes are definitely bigger than your stomach. My favorite were the sliders and the moo shu egg rolls. I had two sliders and one egg roll and they were both pretty good. The nachos and the dip were also tasty and we did end up with alot of food leftover, even after we made a nice dent in all of it. Note to readers, Yard house portions are pretty big, which is never a bad thing!  It was a great evening with two fabulous ladies that I hadn't seen in awhile. Get there early so that you can enjoy happy hour. It's well worth it.

I had the pleasure of dining with two lovely ladies this past Tuesday evening. We were coming here for Restaurant week, but ended up ordering straight off the menu. From start to finish, the service was outstanding. Our hostess greeted us with the biggest smile ever, our waitress was so very knowledgeable and I took her recommendation from my glass of wine ( Ancient Peaks Cab) to dinner (Grilled Organic Salmon on Crispy Potato Cake molasses, lime, McClendon's honey) to dessert (The "Beloved" Chocolate Mousse Featuring Guittard Chocolate) OMG! everything was amazing. The table even shared the Mac and Cheese made with Vermont Cheddar. I am telling you, if I was at home by myself, I would have licked the bowl. Same for the Chocolate Mousse. (still shaking my head it was so good)  Will I be back, absolutely! It really was a great experience from start to finish!

I am starting to really like North Mountain. Today I was even able to do trail # 44 twice which is huge for me considering that it's a steep incline pretty much the entire time but its a great cardio workout. I was trail #100 with some friends on Easter and that trail was pretty cool too. Actually there are quite a few trails that you could try at North Mountain so you should get bored. The views are amazing at the top of trail # 44. You can see the entire city and on a clear day, which is most days, you can see the Cardinal Stadium. Very nice indeed. All in all, a great workout, especially for someone like me who is doesn't want to join a gym just yet. Your legs, calves, and thighs will be sore later but your body will thank you for it!

I come here on a regular basis for the soup and to grab an ice cream cone on the way out. I have had the chicken chili, the regular chili, tortilla soup and the french onion soup. All of them are delicious! Seriously. The chili (both of them) are outstanding, the tortilla soup has a nice kick to it, and the french onion soup.. oh la la. Quick, cheap, delicious. Done!

Hmmm The Noodle Shop. Me and the girls wanted something cheap and easy, and we didn't feel like going off the strip. So we went to old relible which is The Noodle Shop. We each order the same thing which was Kung Pao Chicken. (I know lame but hey) I ordered my extra spicy and they did not let me down. I swear we each had so much food but as hungry as we were, it was well worth it. Service was a little off but considering we were not in a hurry and had no where to be, it was quite ok.  If you are ever in Vegas and staying at the Mandalay Bay, stop over to The Noodle Shop. Yes the reviews are all over the place but you just may be pleasantly surprised.

Every time I have gone to Butterfields, I have been really happy with my meal. The omelet I get (Feta and spinach) is light and fluffy, my pancakes are warm with butter melting all over them, the coffee is VERY STRONG, thank goodness for sugar and half and half, and the service is great.   I have gone early in the morning when there hasn't been a wait, mid morning where you are waiting upwards of 30 mins or more and after 1pm when again there is no wait. All in all, I enjoy Butterfields for breakfast and so far I have not had a bad meal. I hope that streak continues :)

I go to the other location on Bell all the time and this one is equally nice and very quiet. I mean a quick $3 wash plus free vacuums? How can you possible not like that? You can of course get an upgraded wash but for me a $3 wash is just as good as a more expensive ones. All in all for $3 how can you complain?

I swear I wrote a review about this place. At any rate a nice place to go for a quick bite to eat. The have customized my lettuce wraps each time because I don't want all the sodium that is added (makes them very salty). I have been more times than I have checked in.and I will keep coming back.

Very cute little place. We were there for Jill and Jesse's rehearsal dinner and they made sure that if you left hungry, that was your fault. From the bread, to the salad to the yummy panini's to the mostaccioli it was all good. Everyone raved about the desserts but I was not a fan (sorry guys but me no like the nutella brownies tiramisu or cannoli's) I could have had an entire basket of the warm baked bread and some olive oil and I would have been a happy camper. The only thing that stopped me from hogging it all was the fact that I had a bridesmaid's dress to fit into the next day. Otherwise I would have done some serious damage.  If I am ever out in the Mesa area and craving some Italian, I will definitely stop by again. Good food and great staff!!!

What can you say about Baskin Robbins? I mean they carry my two favorite all time favorites, Jamoca Almond fudge and Rocky Road. Depending on my mood determines which flavor I get. Sometimes if I can't chose I just get both. This is one of the rare locations that offer $1 scoop Tuesday and buy one get one free sundaes on Wednesdays. The staff are usually high school students that remind me of when my friends worked at Baskin Robbins in Waukegan way back in the day. Wow,, such a long time ago. If you are itchin for some ice cream and don't just want frozen yogurt,  boogie on down to Baskin Robbins!

This review will be short and sweet. I promise!  I was able to have breakfast here with the guys as our weekend was coming to an end and it was pretty darn good. I ordered the pancakes with scrambled eggs and extra crispy bacon. YUM! Dennis ordered the Mardi Gras omelet with fruit and I swear the is the second time this weekend he had mardi gras something. The first was mardi gras pasta over at pappadeaux. Hmm I see a theme lol. JD ordered eggs and chicken sausage and let me just say I have never heard the word sausage sound as naughty as it did with these two around. Even our server Steven was blushing by the time we left.  All in the the service was good, the food was good and the company was awesome.  I will have to come back and try lunch or dinner one day soon.

I had never been to a single Chick-fil-A until recently. Now I understand what the hype is about. Oh my word, those chicken sandwhiches are so flipping good. Yes I know the owner has been in the news and I won't go into all that as I do not share his views, but I will say the food is delicious. This particular location is ALWAYS packed, no matter what time you go. You would swear they were giving away food the way people are lined up (literally) Oh and the milk shakes,  good grief. The fatty mcfatty in me cannot get enough of them. So delicious. See now my mouth is drooling already.

Words cannot begin to describe just how thrilled I am right now. I had the pleasure of working with Jeremy and his team and they helped me refinance my home. O M G! First of all, the man has more patience than anyone I know. Second, he saved me a nice chunk of money and got my interest rate lowered to where I am still in shock. He stayed on top of everything and kept me updated on every detail regarding refinancing my home. If you are EVER, EVER in need of refinancing or you are looking to buy a new home, contact Jeremy first!! He will make sure you are well taken care of and get you the best possible rate. Thank you again Jeremy for EVERYTHING!

This place has helped me with my chocolate covered raisin addiction as I get them from the bulk bins. I have to be careful as to not go overboard and stick with only a pound of them as they are a little pricey, but so very good. I enjoy coming here for all my fresh fruit and vegetables as well. I mean anytime you can get three or four ruby red grapefruits for a dollar? Two bell peppers for a dollar? See where I am going with this. I make it a running joke with myself to see if I can come out this store spending under $15 dollars and so far so good. Let see how long this last. Seriously though it really is a great place to come for all your fruits and vegetables along with fresh meat and other items. Check this place out. You will not be disappointed.

Still a huge fan. The produce prices are really good along with just about everything else. For the first time ever I spent over $60 but I had a cart load of stuff. The most I had ever spent before that was maybe $25. Seriously though everything is always stocked and the staff are very friendly. Still my #1 go to spot for all my produce and chocolate covered raisins needs :)

What can I say about Execucar. I love their service. It cost just as much if not cheaper than taking a cab for me. I make a reservation on-line, get confirmation via email as well as a phone call the day before confirming my reservation. The cars are always nice, clean, and fresh smelling (yes that may seem weird but I have been in some cabs that were like WHOA!) The drivers are always in shirts, ties, and slacks and they are professional and courteous. I have never had a driver be late (knock on wood) and they have always gotten me to the airport on-time. Plus I get some frequent flyer miles added to my USAirways account for using them. Can we say bonus!

I recently found out about this place back in Aug when I had to find some hair to do my braids. There are two locations and I will admit, I like this one much better. Both the owner and the othet guy that works in there are very nice and extremely helpful. Their prices are very reasonable for weaves, wigs, accesories, and braid hair. However their prices on products are a little high. But if you need some, chances are they may have it. So if you are looking to change up your hairstyle a bit, check this place out. You may find what you are looking for.

Its been a hot minute since I have been to Celsius. As a matter of fact, the last time I was there was back in Feb, right before Valentine's day and it was because my apt complex was holding a function at this location. I am not gonna lie although I do remember that the sushi was good, however the waiter we had was cute and made my experience so much better.  YUM!  So with that said, the sushi was good, the beer was cold, and the company I was with was great. Not bad for a sushi place. I must get back over there and visit again soon. I doubt my cute waiter is still there but it sure was fun flirting with him

I feel bad for all the others that have been here and not gotten good service as everytime I have come for happy hour the service has been really good. I usually end up with the same waitress and the sad part is I still don't know her name. The zipparitas with chambord as well as the one mixed with a strawberry daiquiri are really good, the beers are huge, the nachos are yummy  as well are the fries and they are very cheap for happy hour. All in all not a bad place to visit. I do hope that service gets betters for others though. :(

99 cent Taco Tuesdays! Yep this is why I come to this place. That and their super nachos should be illegal. I do find that their breakfast burritos are more expensive than other places which is weird because they all taste the same, so why almost a $1+ more? At any rate, Tuesday nights, me and Filberto's usually have a date :)

I was the client from hell!!! Well not really but everyone that knows me knows exactly how particular I am about EVERYTHING! So needless to say after doing lots of research I decided to go with Aladdin Roofing. I drove my Sales Consultant ,Tom Quammen crazy. Lets just say that if he can put up with me then he can handle anyone. When we first met I had major, major doubts but he proved me wrong.   There were a few hiccups along the way and I have learned that with contractors, you have to expect some hiccups. One major thing was a scheduling snafu which had me very angry and I let it be known that you have got to keep the lines of communication open at all times, especially with a client like me. Believe me I think that entire company learned from that mistake, but I did not curse anyone out, however I did let them know that I was beyond disappointed.   Fast forward to Monday in which they had a crew of 8 men out to work on getting my roof replaced. Everyone was on time, very friendly and very thorough. They worked diligently for 11 hours and when it was all said and done my roof looks great. Tom was on-site for most of the day making sure that things were getting completed in a timely fashion and made sure that everything was to my liking. The crew cleaned up everything and Tom not only helped with the clean up, but came back the next day just to make sure nothing was missed since it was close to dark when the job was finished as well as to check to make sure that everything was as it was before I got my roof done.  So as of right now, I am very happy with my new roof. The true test will be during a really good rainstorm, but I do believe the job was done efficiently and effectively so I don't forsee any problems   If you are in need of a new roof, make sure to contact Aladdin Roofing and ask for Tom. He will make sure the job is done right and within your budget.

I visited this place back in February and it was a great self tour. Its kinda pricey but great nonetheless. My husband is a huge Titanic fan so he has been on this tour a few times. I stopped back here last Tuesday to pick up a souvenir for the hubs as again he is a fan. All in all, if you are in the area, check out this exhibition. you may even be able to get cheaper tickets elsewhere so try if you can.

I had the pleasure of eating here a few Saturdays ago on a blind date :) I was craving some Pho and my date was like sure, I have never had it before so lets go. We ordered the pork and shrimp spring rolls which by the way were filled with tons of shrimp. I knew that had to have been a mistake because I swear I had a bite of shrimp each time. Not that I am complaining one bit! I ordered the Chicken and Shrimp soup (Do you see a theme? lol) and my friend kept it safe and just ordered the fried rice, which he says was some of the best he has ever had. My soup came out piping hot with tons of chicken and shrimp and herbs. I was one happy campy. So why the four stars if everything was good. The bathroom had a weird smell to it. I know, I know what does that have to do with the rest of the place. Well if you got to go potty and the bathroom stinks, it kinds of throws you off you know. I will go back as the food was really good, I will just remember to avoid the bathroom next time :)

I have learned that the best time to visit Sweet Tomatoes is in the late afternoon after the morning and lunch rush. So much more peaceful and easier to get to the grub. That being said, I do like going to Sweet Tomatoe from to time. They have tons of soups and salads to choose from along with fresh focaccia, yummy cornbread, muffins, pastas, and depending on the which month, a certain theme and with this April being the theme was all about Lemons. Oh and don't forget about the dessert. YUM!  It is a seems a little pricey to me for a mostly salad buffet but its a cool place to go for a quick, fulfilling meal from time to time.

Everyone raves about this place and yet I am still trying to figure out why? No offense but they really do put on way too much frosting on their cupcakes and my mom makes way better cupcakes. Don't get me wrong, for those of you that love this place, by all means enjoy, plus they are very charitable, however these cupcakes just are not on my top fav list.

TJ's is located right down the street from me and they have been my go to place for quite some time. Their pizza is always cooked just right and their wings are very good. I mean you can choose from a few different sauces however I always go for the hot or suicide (and yes its spicy but I like spicy) Plus their large cheese pizza and 24 wings for $20.65 is not to shabby either. (additional toppings are $1.65 each) They also have an everyday lunch special til for for 2 slices of pizza and a medium drink for $4.25. Not to bad if I say so myself.   So some people will like this place (Like me!) and others may not but until you try it for yourself you will never know.

I had mini date night and we decided to come here on a whim. I mean it is close to my house so why not. Plus they have reverse happy hour and their boneless wings were on special in which they were half off all month with any drink purchase. Score. My friend decided that he wanted to try the Eclipse Burger challenge in which included 3 half pound angus patties, topped with 4 strips of bacon, cheddar and swiss cheese with crispy onions and a side of fries. If he finished it, he got a t-shirt and his picture placed on the wall. Well he finished it with no problem. He doesn't eat like that all the time and he said that he was full but not overly stuffed. Kudos to him. It looked amazing and I so wanted a bite, but alas he had to finish it all himself. Hmm maybe next time I will try. LOL ( NOT!)

My review is a little biased as I know someone who works for the Wyndham so my experiences at the ICON Bar have always been great. I have had their blueberry mojito which was freaking FANTABULOUS and the drink I had last night was a melon or cantaloupe martini. WOW! Very good indeed. I have also had just about every appetizer and again, I am biased because they have all been very good.   So stop in for a drink before you head on your way to wherever you are venturing to downtown. You may just be pleasantly surprised.

I am biased because my friend from high school owns this place. However even if he didn't, I will still say this place rocks. The food is great, the beer is fabulous and the people there are awesome. I need to get back soon to try some of their meads as well as some of their newer selections. Seriously though, it really is a great place, you will not be disappointed.

I got to hang out with my girls Rachel and Amy on Tuesday night at this cute little wine bar that I didn't even know existed. Its tucked away on a corner off of Becker Ln right before Shea. Justin was taking care of us behind the bar and he was very knowledgeable with the wines and the food pairings. Plus I got to meet the owner Casey who was a sweetie as well.   We started off with the Gorgonzola and fig appetizer (yummy) and I had the grilled cheese sandwich that came with these chips that had a nice little bite to them. Top that off with a nice glass of Cab and I was a happy woman.   There was a band playing that night and they were quite good. I feel bad because I do not remember their names, but they did do a good job.   My only complaints were that the woman's bathroom, although clean, didn't smell very good and the fact that your credit card number prints on the receipt. The credit card thing bothers me the most with all the identity theft that has been going on so I hope that that changes soon.   All in all, great place to go to grab a glass of wine and some good food, especially after hours as they are open from 5pm to 2am.

What a night! So I decided to treat myself to some lovely mudbugs aka crawfish during the annual crawfish boil that happens every March to April here at Pappadeaux's. I got in just in time to get a seat at the bar and get situated. The fantabulous Susan, Sarah and Colin took GREAT care of me all night. From Susan nudging me to get the bigger glass of beer (good call and it was an easy nudge) to all three of them checking in on me as I was devouring the 2.5 lbs of crawfish I had ordered. #teamgreedy in full effect!  So between the fabulous bar staff and me meeting some new bar patrons, it was a great night. I chatted it up with about everyone and we even had some skinamax stuff going on at the end of the bar. Funny indeed. Oh and to top off my night, my entire dinner tab was paid for by the nice gentleman I had chatted it up with most of the evening. How very sweet and overly generous was that? ( No,no love connection or anything just a kind gesture with NO expectations!) Wow, talking about being blessed.   I only have about two more weeks before the crawfish boil ends. So needless to say I will be back again the next two Thursdays to get my fix.

Wow all the reviews for Lucille's are bad and yet I had a good time there last Friday night. Myself, Mark T, my friend Beth and her parents. Luckily Beth had a reservation as that place was packed. We had to wait a few minutes for our table to be ready but it was a good time for all of us to also catch up as I hadn't seen Beth's parents in over a year.   We get to our table and order some drinks which by the way are served in mason jars. Pretty cool except for the fact that the ice tea was a little weak. We ordered some fried okra which was fried to perfection and piping hot. It came with two different dipping sauces but alas I just at them like popcorn. Note to self, wait for them to cool down before poping them in your mouth because those suckers were HOT!   I ordered a full slab of ribs with greens and mashed sweet potatoes. OMG they were so good. The meat was falling off the bone and the sauce they used was a little sweet, just like I like it. I actually added a little more of their hot and spicy bbq sauce because I like both the sweet and spicy mixture of sauces on my bbq. The greens were ok but needed some hot sauce and the mashed sweet potatoes were good. I ended up taking most of my meal home because I got full off of the fried okra and as well as warm biscuits. My friend's mom ordered the exact same thing as I did, Mark T. ordered the chicken, in which he said was pretty good. My friend's dad ordered the tri tip in which he seemed to enjoy and my friend ordered the fried catfish in which she also seemed to enjoy.   For dessert, the snickers ice cream pie was ordered along with old fashioned banana pudding. I had a few bites of the snickers pie and it was really good. I wanted to eat more, but I was already stuffed and I didn't want to overdo it any more than I already had. I didn't try the banana pudding but my friends' father seemed to enjoy.   All in all, it was a good time. I mean the company I was with FABULOUS and the food was good. What more can you ask for on a Friday night?

I have been to this location many times and for some reason I am just getting around to writing a review. I was there with some coworkers for a luncheon and the service was as good as always, heck maybe even better considering it was party of 19!   Let me start off by giving a HUGE shout out to Gina and John, our waitress and waiter of a table of 19. They were OUTSTANDING!!! Well almost as I am giving someone who shall not be named a half star for not asking if we wanted to have dessert before presenting us with the check. Hello! That was no-no. However I must admit this person redeemed themselves hence the reason why I go back to saying OUTSTANDING service!   The table started off with four orders of the southwest appetizer sampler which included bison sliders, jalapeno cheese and spinach dip, and the southwest egg rolls. Everyone dived into them immediately as we had four of them on our table and were a hungry bunch. I must admit, they I tried a little of everything and it was quite good. I had never had bison before and it was very lean and very juicy. Very, very good.   Next everyone ordered everything from theSpinach Salad, crab cake sandwich, burgers, Tuscan chicken pasta, and slew of other things just to name a few. I ordered the lobster and shrimp tacos with those fabulous garlic fries. Now I must say that I was disappointed in the lobster and shrimp tacos as they were overloaded with old bay seasoning which made them EXTRA salty. I am a fan of old bay but you gotta use that in moderation because that is some salty seasoning. FYI if for some reason I am mistaken and they did not use old bay (which is sure as heck tasted like it) then my apologies but it was still do darn salty. The garlic fries however were yummy as always. If you are not a fan of garlic I would NOT recommend that you try these fries or you will be beyond disappointed. I am just happy that I don't have to talk to anyone in the near future because I am sure I reek of garlic. No vampires are coming near me that is for damn sure.   We also ordered dessert after of course I made a fuss ( but in a good funny way) and believe me it was well worth it. My one coworker ordered the warm apple bread pudding and she swears it was the best bread pudding she has ever had. I am not a fan of bread pudding so I will have to take her word for it. Everyone else ordered the mini dessert tasters that come in tall shot glass. Just enough for a little taste of heaven without going over board. I ordered the strawberry cheesecake and although it was very good, I dang near choked on the crust at the bottom of the shot glass. That is what I get for being greedy. Other coworkers ordered the carrot cheesecake mini, chocolate peanut butter mini, chocolate fudge cake mini and of course a couple of the strawberry cheesecake minis. Someone also ordered their pumpkin pie cheesecake and like the bread pudding, it got rave reviews. Again I will have to take their word on it.   I will give them 4 out of 5 stars. Why not 5? Well my particular lunch was not outstanding, although everyone else seemed to have enjoyed theirs and not exactly offering dessert. Again I do give HUGE shot out to Gina and John and also to the cute hostess (I will let them wonder which one I was talking about) Awesome service indeed!

This is becoming one of my favorite trails.  I start at the N. Mtn visitors center and take the long, rocky, but definitely worth it trail up to the towers. I have been trying to run most of it but I always get winded once I get to the base of the incline. Be careful as it is pretty rocky and your trip down can be dangerous if you are not careful.  Especially if you tend to run down like I try to do.  I am happy to say I am not as winded as I use to be when I first started visiting this trail. One of these days I will run from top to bottom.

I went here for a wine tasting with the Arizona Winebats and had a great time. The  people were really nice, the wine was good and the appetizers we had for our event were very good and plentiful. I will definitely go back for dinner or more yummy appetizers.

Really? I have never written a review for this place? Wow! Yes I am giving it 5 solid stars. Every single time I have come (and I pray I don't jinx myself) the service has been great. Last night was no exception. Ryan went above and beyond great service and for that I give him a huge shout out. Thank you again Ryan!!! Happy hour from 4pm-7pm that include half price drinks and appetizers. Sold!!  Even though he told me not too, I am giving a shout out to the manager on duty last night (02.23.12) who's name I do not know. You went above and beyond as well. For those that were wondering, nope nothing happened just the service and the food was great last night. (The nachos were piled high and the wings were perfect) I enjoy coming to this place and I will continue to do so whenever I am in the area.

This was my first visit to Kabuki on a lazy Sunday afternoon. I met a friend there after going to see the early showing of Avatar, which by the way was fabulous but that is for another review.  They had a special menu for game day inwhich anything that was on this list, you buy one and you get the next item for $1. Not too shabby considering it was about 12:30 or so on a Sunday and its hard to find a happy hour that early on a Sunday (do they even exist?)  Our waiter Ryan was very patient and he backed me up when I was trying to explain to my friend some of the "safe rolls" as he is still a sushi novice. (Poor thing doesn't realize what he is missing)  We ordered Kirin, Philly Roll, Lotus Roll (which was topped with lobster yummy) Cucumber roll, Salmon roll, Unagi, Sweet Shrimp, Baked Scallop Roll - whew. (Hey this is from the girl who goes to all you can eat sushi, what did you expect?) I think my friend got a nice easy intro into sushi. I mean he eats it from time to time, but I need to get home onto bigger and better things.  At any rate, the sushi was very good. The lotus roll, the baked scallop roll, and my unagi were of course my favorites. I love my unagi! I tried to get my friend to try it and he did try an ity bity bit. He said it was ok but I am not too sure. He did eat the shrimp which was pretty impressive but trying to see him get the tail off was pretty funny. However he did it in a very dignified way so kudos for him. Needless to say I stuffed myself as usual but its Sushi!!! I love sushi. Enough said.  It was a very cute restaurant and not crowded, but then again it was a Sunday afternooon and I am not sure people know about their game day special. Again kudos to Ryan for the excellent service he provided.  I will definitely have to try Kabuki again if I am ever on that side of town. All in all it was a very good Sunday afternoon with a great friend.

Cheap GOOD drinks, good sushi, great happy hour, decent location. Not too shabby.  Be advised, get their early as this place does fill up fast on certain days.. (Usually Thursdays and Fridays)! The patio is for the smokers, so if you are a smoker, you will be happy to have your own little section. Oh and the DJ is pretty damn good to. Especially on Fridays :)

Garlic Soy Edamame and Steve! Yup two favorites right off the bat. I met a friend of mine for birthday sushi and drinks as we both wanted to try someplace new. Pearl sushi it is as they have Sushi Gone wild on Tuesdays where if you have a Pearl card, you are able to order from a special sushi menu and have $3 Svedka martini's all night. The card is $5 but you earn points every time you eat there with double points on certain nights. Once you reach 500 points they give you $25 in Pearl Cash to use on food and drinks. Sign me up!!   The Garlic Soy Edamame was the BOMB! We smelled it as it was being brought out to other diners and we both were like, we want that. I really need to know how to make it as it was VERY good. Steve was a great bartender and he kept our drinks coming. I am telling you, they tasted like fruit punch but those suckers sure had a kick. I woke up this morning with a slight hangover lol. The sushi was pretty good as well and I introduced my friend to some sushi that also had jalapeno in it. Needless to say, he is now a fan of spicy sushi dishes lol. The company, the food, the drinks and the serve was fabulous and I can't wait to come back again. ( I need the points lol)

As much as I had to admit it, Whole Paycheck er Foods is the stuff. I mean yes their prices are higher than any other grocery store, but the quality of food just cannot  be beat. I usually go on Wednesdays to get a the salad buffet as sometimes it is half off, sometimes it is $1.50 off and sometimes it is $2 off. It just varies. I love getting a fresh green shake made ( Fire on the Mountain and Peachy Green are my favs) as well as getting the Shaved brussel sprout and kale salad. Oh dear lord, if that salad was not $8.99 a pound, I would go and get it every day as it really is that  good. Last time I was there I spent $15 and I got a half a pound of  the mentioned salad, half a pound of roasted brussel sprouts with pancetta and shaved romano cheese, and a 16oz Peachy Green shake. Even though I was able to spread this out for two days, it was still a little pricey for me. But it is a nice treat if you can swing it.  The staff are wonderful, the food is fresh, the prices are high, but hey you definitely get what you pay for and good quality food is EXPENSIVE!

I went here for dinner on July 17. I must admit that it was a little overwhelming trying to figure out exactly what to eat but end the end my favorite dishes were the seabass skewers, lobster taquitos, and the Choc Banana dessert. Heck anything would have been in the sauce they used for that Sea Bass dish. YUMMY!    Yes it was a bit pricey, but the food was good. Give it a try.

I too have a love/hate relationship with Bikram Yoga. I love the fact that I am learning just how flexible my body is with all the different poses that we do as well as the fact that you sweat, A LOT. I mean A LOT! More than I have ever sweated. Even my afro puffs are dripping wet when I leave out of there. Everyone is super friendly (staff and students alike) so why only 4 stars you ask?  Well it is more like 4.5 stars and it is due to the smell that I am having a hard time with Bikram. I don't mind the heat one bit and it feels really good when I am done knowing that I just completed 90 solid minutes of breathing, sweating, poses, etc. But I have left out of there every single time as if I am going to be sick to my stomach due to the smell. I have had to stop an gather myself again while doing poses and refocus because I have gotten nauseated. I am told the more that I come, the more you don't notice it but considering you are trying to breathe through your nose and not your mouth makes it really hard. A mixture of body odor, feet, and sweat from all the other classes before I arrive is what makes it a little hard for me. They do try to air it out after each class, and I do commend them for that, but still, once those doors close, the fans are turned off and the heat is turned back up, wowza.  There must be something I can do to help me get past that small hiccup but all in all it is great and I have enjoyed attending.

I am a little confused as to why my original review is no longer here? It was a positive review and nothing negative was said. Interesting... Nevertheless I have been to NoRTH numerous times and the food and drinks are always outstanding. I will say that sometimes you feel slightly rushed but for the most part it is still a great place to dine. They have renovated which makes the place seem bigger and albeit a little more dark. But that is not a bad thing as the food still taste fabulous.   Still scratching my head as to where my original review went. Oh well...

Thank you to all of the fabulous yelpers before me! Because of you I choose Camelback Moving for my move into my new house and they were as fabulous as you stated.  My two man crew consisted of Adam and Moses (thanks guys) and they were the bees knees. They called me to let me know exactly when they would show up to help me with my move and arrived on time and got right to it. They were speedy as I wanted to make sure I kept it at the 2 hour limit with 3 being my max for budgetary reasons.  They were done just shy of the two hours and worth every single penny. Moses even took pity on my Ikea entertainment center that I have had for 10 years and fixed it like knew for me. (Thank you Moses)  Although I won't be moving anytime soon (I did just by my first home and all lol) I will be recommending them to anyone that needs movers because this company really is top notch!

Z'Tejas = num yummy!! I mean the margaritas and cornbread alone are worth coming to visit. I had some pulled pork quesadilla's that were packed with yummy goodness. Lots of pulled pork with the coleslaw. OMG. I could only eat two of the four pieces as I had already filled up on cornbread and chips and salsa. The only thing I was bummed about was that the cornbread can out a little cold for my liking. If could have even been warm I would have been happy, but it did not stop me from eating it. Definitely a great place to come, especially for happy hour!

WOW! That is all I can say is WOW! You would have never guessed I did a 12+ mile and 28 obstacle race in Utah ( in which I had to climb the mountains 3 times)  just recently the way that this mountain kicked my butt. I will chalk it up to me still being a little tired/sore from that race for my failure to keep up. Yea that was it! LOL. I loved every grueling minute of it and the views are spectacular. Plus I even got to see some AMAZING houses that are hidden behind the mountainside. I really cannot wait to do it again even though it was the stair master from HELL!!

Cevapi and Burek oh my!! Plus I got to hang with my fabulous friend Amra! Score! We wanted something extra good to eat after finishing our Mud Factor race on Saturday and lord knows I have been craving some Cevapi so off we went to Euro Bakery. It was already bookmarked as a place I wanted to try so this was a win, win in my book.   Everything is made fresh to order and once you walk in, you can smell the fresh baked bread that they have made throughout the day. There is also a mini grocery store for you to buy items as well.  My Cevapi (little beef sausages with fresh bread, onions and a  sour cream like dip) came out piping hot and piled high. My friends Burek was huge (hmm not sure hot to explain so you will have to look that one up) and we both dived in like it was the last meals we would ever have.  Will I come back? Hmm heck yes, but alas this treat can only be saved for when I burn off and absurd amount of calories so that I can indulge and not feel guilty at all.  Hmm Cevapi and Burek = one VERY happy woman!

Although service was good, my drink was seriously watered down. To the point of me almost saying, can I just get a rum on the rocks? Seriously. Basically I paid $12 total for two cokes with a splash of rum. It reminded me of hearing Kat Williams say, if your drink is really, really dark like blood, that is because you didn't order vodka buddy so sit your broke A$$ down. I actually paid for some alcohol and got none.. I am not asking you to pour like I am fish, but man, can you add a little bit of spirits to my coke? That would be lovely, thanks!  I wasn't the only one with this issue as another member of our party complained about the exact same thing.

Not really sure how to rate this place. I mean its ok but I have had better. Maybe its because I have gone close to closing each time and I am getting what is left but hey it is what it is. The polish sausage was good as well and the bread was nice and warm. Oh and they do give you free ice cream. You will have to judge for yourself on this one.  Its not my favorite bbq place as the portions are kinda small and its just lacking a certain something that I can't quite put my finger on.

Yup like everyone already said, George does an awesome job and for a price that can't be beat and he is very fast but very, very thorough. My carpets were pretty dirty and he was able to get me in on a moments notice ( literally) My carpets look brand new!!!! I would highly recommend George because he does an awesome job and his prices are great. He even gives you tips on how to keep your carpet looking good. Needless to say I will be calling him again in six months or so for another cleaning. Next time, I won't wait until the last minute.

I was craving some Pad Thai and I had passed by the Thai House on numerous occasions but never stopped so on a whim I decided to give it a try. I am so happy that I did. I ordered take out and it took about 6 mins total from the time I ordered my food to the time I was walking out of the door. (Yes that quick)  I got home and devoured as much of the Pad Thai as I could which doesn't say much as I have over half of it left. Lots of food for a small price and the Pad Thai was really good. I ended up getting #4 spice on the side to add  to it and it made it even better.  (Their spices range from 0 to 5) I will definitely be going back to try their other menu items. If you are interested in some good Thai food on a budget, definitely try out the Thai House as I doubt you will leave hungry or disappointed.

I have been coming to this location for quite some time. The selections are always on point and sometimes, if you are not really looking, you will stumble upon a few that have been marked down... way down.   I was here a few weeks ago picking up a half a case of wine that my sister ordered for me all the way from MO. She ordered my favorite, which is the Callaway Cab however when I went to pick it up, they were all out and didn't know it. They thought they had it in as it was listed on their website, but to there surprise it was no where to be found. So they offered me six bottles of a wine that was comparable ( Unruly Red) but I declined as the Callaway Cab is my favorite. The manager insisted that I take a bottle of the Unruly Red home to try for free as he didn't want me to be without any wine on my birthday. How sweet was that?  So you see why I keep coming back to this location?  I just ordered another few bottles since their five cent sales ends this coming  Monday. Oh you don't know what that is? It is buy one bottle of wine and get the same bottle for five cents. Yea you can't beat that. It happens about twice a year and it is a great way to stock up on your favorite wines, or even try a few. I do wish that they would let you buy one get one that is equal or lesser value of another for five cents so that you are able to try a few more, but hey it s ok. It won't stop me from stocking up on my favorites. Hmm I hope they really do have mine in stock... YIKES!

First things first, this place is in the middle of no where. It is a little hard to find if you are not familiar with the area and heaven forbid it is dark, (which it was) then it makes it even harder to find because there hardly no lights leading up to this place. But once you find it.....   OMG!! I had the pleasure of going here recently with a friend of mine. Once we got there we were a little worried because the website said they closed at 10pm but the sign on the door said 9pm and it was a little after 8. Yikes. Especially since it was pretty empty. But no worries, they welcomed us with opened arms. It is quite different from the Grazie in old town Scottsdale. This one is bigger and more modern but the food is still amazing.   We ordered a bottle of the House Chianti, the Insalata della Casa with the creamy gorgonzola, Vegetariana and the Sofia. First things first, I was either really hungry or that salad was really good. I am going to say that the salad was really good. Perfect blend of cucumbers, red peppers and even olives (I don't even like olives and I ate some of those). Next came out our lovely pizzas. I have never seen so much prosciutto on one pizza in my life. OMG! It was perfect. I had the Vegetariana, which was still as amazing as the first time I had it but my friend ordered the Sofia and we were both like WOW that is alot of prosciutto. We were in pizza heaven. Needless to say we each ate our entire pizza and finished off the Chianti. I felt like a pig but our lovely waitress told me that she sometimes does the same thing so no worries. Considering that she was super tiny and gorgeous I took her word for it LOL.   So will I come back, HECK YES! I am not sure if I will visit this location again or the one in old town Scottsdale, but either way its a win win. The service was good, the pizza was good and the company was great.

Hvala lijepo Balkan Bakery for making my order of Zeljanica extra special. The bakery really did me a huge favor as I wanted to surprise a friend who loves Zeljanica for her birthday and unfortunately I have not mastered the art of making them myself... yet. Enter Balkan Bakery. I ordered 5 of them on Saturday afternoon for pickup Sunday afternoon and not only did he make them for me, but cut them so that they were enough to feed about dozen people. They were a huge hit (as I knew they would be) and my friend was so happy. So again Hvala lijepo!! I will be back for more soon!

This is my neighborhood Fry's. I have been going to this location since I bought my house two years ago. They are always friendly and things are well stocked. Sometimes they items that are on clearance surprise me as it is an extra bonus, especially if you have a coupon for it. All in all, I have no complaints. Friendly, affordable, what more can you ask for?

I know two reviews for the same restaurant. Hey it was different locations so they each get their own review.  :)   Unlike the Scottsdale location in which I was there for happy hour, for this location, I was here for lunch and let me tell you they did not disappoint. The decor was really nice on the inside, however since it was such a nice day outside, we decided to have lunch outside. Our waiter was a sweetheart who could not have been a day over 16 tops.  I think we made the poor kid blush on more than one occasion.   So onto the food. Me and my friend Tanya ordered the same thing, Crab & Shrimp Cakes. OMG they were so, so good. The came out nice and hot and were filled with lots of shrimp and crab. Unlike some places you just get alot of filler. Here, they definitely did not skimp on the amount of shrimp and crab they put into these cakes. I swear if we could have licked our plates we probably could have.  You would think that that the yummy lunch would be enough. Oh no, we just had to have some dessert as well before we started on our shopping excurision. (Note to self, don't eat so much before going shopping or nothing you try on will fit quite right). Ok so back to the dessert, although I am not sure it is still on the menu as we visited during the summer, the dessert I chose was the key lime pie mini dessert. Now can we say that was just a huge tease! lol. Seriously it was very good and it took everything in us not to order another one each. All in all, I had a great time while visiting Brio and I look forward to going to visit again soon.

IMAX on a holiday is $15 per person as they charge weekend rates on holidays. Now why is that necessary? I mean seriously? The theater is nice and all but $15 per ticket? And no drink or popcorn is included? I am still shocked. Never again lol

Very nice group of people that work here. Yes they may work on commission, but they are not pushy and very  patient.  Especially Chris!!!!   Unlike another yelper's experience, when I got my feet evaluated  through ShoeDog, they wiped everything down (including the treadmill) before I proceed. I didn't have high arches but I did favor one foot more than another as I was experience some pain in my right foot. I really wanted to get a new pair of shoes but I opted for the custom insoles instead and they have worked greatly for me as I have noticed a huge difference in the shoes I already have and my right foot does not hurt like it use to. Yes they were expensive but I had just signed up for the VIP program online for a whopping $1.99 for the year so it did save me a few dollars. I will be back to get the shoes that I really want when I can afford them.   So if they are so great, why not 5 stars? Because when I went back to get my custom insoles that I had done on a Friday on that Monday, they had already been tossed (even after I said I was coming back) so I had to get refitted again. Took a few minutes longer than I had planned but it wasn't too bad. I was more bummed that they threw out my custom insoles more than anything.

My very best girlfriend wanted to have a day of pampering. She wanted to use massage school coupons and I was like hmmm not gonna happen. Let me find a place and we can use my Spa Finder gift certificates and spoil ourselves rotten. Fast forward to me finding this sweet little spot, especially since everything thinks she is Hawaiian ( which she isn't but looks it) We were each able to receive a special they had going on for a 50 min facial and a 50 min massage for $98 each as first time clients! SCORE!!  Now the Spa is a little hard to find, but I cannot even knock them for that as once you arrive, they spoil you rotten. It really does look like you just walked into a spa located in Hawaii! Everything is so tranquil and they show you around so that you know exactly where everything is. They give you these comfy robes and shoes to put on and tell you to relax and let them take care of the rest.  Mariposa did my facial and I was so happy when she said to me " You have great skin!" Score one for my momma and her good genes lol. She did an excellent job and for someone who is not fond of facials, I was relaxed and glowing when I walked out of that room 50 mins later. My face still feels heavenly.  Jarid did my massage for me and he was like "good grief woman you are so tight"! I told him that I blame boot camp for that.  He even asked me if I was sore and I was like not really. I guess I am so use to the abuse I get from boot camp I didn't even realize or notice just how tight and sore I was until Jarid got a hold of me. Good grief!  He worked every single knot and muscle in my body to where I felt like jello when he was done. My back and arms felt great considering I didn't know how sore I was until he was done. Just like my facials, I am not one to get massages very often so this was a great little treat. It made me realize that I will need to do this again more often.  So will I be back. Yup! Will I ask for Jarid and Mariposa? Yup! Will I be able to find the spa now? YUP!  It was so worth it!

I swear I have a love hate relationship with this place. Everytime I go to just buy one bottle of wine, I end up with at least 4?!? Grrr But you can't help it. The prices are great and the wine is fabulous. Bevo Mo is ok but Total Wine rocks!!  Check out their prices on all the spirits, beers, etc. You will be amazed that's for sure.

I was here recently for a birthday dinner and  let me just say that the company, food, and service was fabulous.  The calamari was plentiful and perfectly fried. The huevos rolls were heavenly but my cilantro shrimp were OMG good. Oh and the portions. OMG the portions! Can they be any bigger? Believe me I am not complaining at all. I was in food heaven. Let us not forget the flaky croissants they serve as well. I am still shaking my head because the food was just that good. They even split the bill for us and for those that shared the appetizers it as split into 1/3 on our bill. I have never seen that before and thought it was pretty cool. So why on 4 stars if everything was amazing? Because all of their tables are bolted down and with a party of ten, although our tables were next to each other, it would have been nice to all sit at one big table. However I will definitely be back here again soon!

Brazilian Waxing.. for those that knows what this is knows the pain one endures to get this done, but the benefits definitely outweighs the pain. I had been putting this off for longer than one should  and I finally bit the bullet and went to have it done. Luckily for me I got mine done by none other than D'Lisa herself. She is also the owner of this beautiful salon and knowing my hesitation, she was the only one I wanted to have do my waxing since I had heard such REMARKABLE things about her waxing skills. Sweet baby Jesus!! first off,  D'Lisa explains everything she is going to do in great detail, preps you and gets started. She is quick so that any pain you may experience is minimal. Is it pain free, for me not exactly but the more I have come, the less painful it has been and believe me I am beyond thrilled by this little tidbit. She really pays attention to detail and makes sure you are very smooth when you leave.  Yes more information than one probably wants to know but hey if you ever want to get a Brazilian done, you might is well get it done by the best. Now I look forward to my monthly visits. Another tidbit she has a Phoenix location as well! :)

I am going to make this short and sweet. Expensive salad/sandwich/crepe place that people seem to flock to for lunch. Not sure why as its just ok. Nothing more, nothing less. If you have about $15 to blow on lunch, then give this place a try. Your experience may be better than mine on the two occasions I was there.

I will say this, the sushi, once you finally get it is amazing so the two stars is for the sushi only. That is about all the nice things I have to say.   I was here with a very large party for a friend's birthday. She warned them (and I do mean warned them) in advanced that it was going to be a large party so you would think that we would have maybe 3 or 4 servers for a party of 40. (not kidding on that number either) So the two servers we had were ok. I would usually name them by name, but alas I won't on this occasion because the service wasn't the best. I am not blaming the servers as they not only had our party of 40 but other tables as well.   Anywho, my gripe is this. For a busy Saturday night, you would think that they would have enough people to handle all of the people that were at this restaurant. The bar was super slow, the sushi bar was well slow. Let's just say everyone else in our party of 40 were almost finished with their sushi by the time myself and another young lady finally got ours. Yes again , it was good, but wow, it took a very long time. We only had three rolls between the two of us.   So don't got with a party larger than 6 max! I watched other tables with smaller parties get their food and drinks at record speed so size does matter in this situation. If you go, go early before it gets too busy so that you won't wait for your food or your drinks. Oh and it is a little pricey so be warned. I have no problem paying for good food, as long as the service is just as good. Catch my drift?

I stopped in their last night right before I hit up the Jamie Foxx concert at the Dodge Theater. It's a cute little place. Very, clean and quite quiet on a Thursday evening. But then again it was technically after hours (7pm) in the downtown area so unless major is going on it just may be like this all the time.   The guy that took care of me was really sweet. I wish I would have gotten his name. He was patient as I was trying to decide on the only slice of pizza I wanted. LOL In the end I choose a huge slice of piping hot pepperoni and for under $3.00 for my slice, not to shabby.   I sat myself down and watched some of the college football game and enjoyed my wonderfully delicious slice of pepperoni pizza. I swear their was pepperoni in ever bite. It wasn't greasy and the crust was just perfect. He even checked up on me to make sure I didn't want a second slice. My mind was screaming YES, YES but alas I was good and politely declined.  Very friendly, very clean, great prices and damn good pizza. They have tons of specials so you can't go wrong. Check this place out if you haven't already.

Half off bottles of wine all day every Wednesday! Score. Get the angry Edamame, very tasty. Our bartender Tom was great and this place gets PACKED so get there early if you can. Sushi was fresh and very good. So all in all, good service, good food, great company. Exactly what I needed!

After visiting with some friends in Tempe, myself and Emily R. decided to stop for a quick nitecap. Very cool place. The DJ's were jamming, the bartenders were friendly, and everyone seemed to know everyone. Plus it's 20% off on Sunday's nights so that makes it even better. Even so, it really is a cool, laid back kind of place where you can grab a drink, catch up with friends, or even a cool place for a first date. I will definitely be back here soon.

My experience with Belle Melange was fabulous. I came in on my birthday and Shaunte too care of me right away. The salon is one the nicest I have seen and the service in remarkable. The entire staff is friendly and it appears that they make sure they do no overlap any appointments so that no one is ever kept waiting for any services. Oh did I mention that my hair turned out fabulous! Thank you Shaunte! I will definitely be back.

Seriously this salon rocks. I introduced my girl Jill C. there way back when she was looking for a new salon along with a potential salon for her wedding updo. I told her that they would take good care of her and not only did Shaunte and Deja make her looking absolutely stunning on her wedding day, Deme and the rest of the ladies made sure that us ladies in the wedding party looked fantastic too. Every time someone ask me where I get my hair done, I let them know Belle Melange is where I go and it is where you should go to. Speaking of which I need to make another appointment asap!

I have been to a Brazilian steakhouse before and this one was just as good as the one I went to in DC. The service was outstanding. The food was unbelievable. All the meats were good but my favorite was the filet mignon. It just melted in your mouth! I am drooling just thinking about it. We ordered a bottle of red that was so good. It went perfectly with all of the meat we were eating. How we had room for dessert is beyond me but the hot molten cake and the tres leches, wow!  The cheese knots were addictive and my waiter even snuck me a little box full of them at the end of the night. I will definitely be going back again.

How have I never been to Humble Pie is beyond me! I know that I will definitely be   coming back again very soon. Their bartenders are great, even if they did continue to call me by the wrong name no matter how many times I corrected them. Plus they have happy hour everyday from 11-6 for drinks and 3-6 for food. SOLD! Sitting on their patio on a hot summer day was actually quite pleasant thanks to the misters.. Yep I definitely look forward to coming back again soon!

Aside from me making a wrong turn and taking longer than I should have, I do love this trail. I am surprised that I haven't been more often (will have to change that stat) Once you get to the top of trail 150, it makes life so much better and you get your aha moment. Climbing down can be a bit tricky so please be careful. It is not to steep (only about .06 miles of it) but again once you reach the top it is worth it. Try not to get lost (like I did) but it made for a nice hike (although not as quickly as I planned)

Windermere, you were a-ok in my book until you did the unthinkable and charged my credit card for another room all because that persons card "declined" WHO THE HELL DOES THAT?   I was there for my girl Jill B's (now C) wedding this pass weekend. The hotel is an older hotel but I gave them the benefit of the doubt. The rooms were clean, everyone was super accommodating and her wedding was fantastic. The staff did go above and beyond anything that she could have asked for and for that, I am truly grateful considering I was her MOH and I needed her to be extra calm and relaxed on her big day. So for that they get a great big 4 stars for just being awesome in that aspect.   HOWEVER!!!! You get a big fat ZERO for charging my card for an extra room because the other persons credit card happened to decline, so you took it upon yourself to charge my card because it was on file. That is just horrible, horrible business. Just because Jill's name was on both rooms, you took 2 different credit cards for each room and neither one was Jill's (You had to make an impression of the card remember so I know you knew that Jill was not paying for those rooms) How dare you charge my card for the room and not think I was not going to notice. FAIL FAIL FAIL!  So what you would have billed Jill if my card was not on file? FAIL! You do not mess with other people's money like that. Granted you say you are going to take care of it and reverse the charges but still, you have left bad impression even after the fabulous time we at Jill's wedding. If I ever have to stay here again, I will only pay cash so that this NEVER EVER EVER happens again.

I will make this short and sweet since everything there is to say about Scramble has already been said. One word - Sweet Potato Hash. Sweet baby Jesus that is some good eats. What I loved even more was the fact that I was able to substitute it for my regular potatoes for no extra charge. Sweet. Sadly this will become a regular spot for me after my hike up North Mountain on any given Saturday. Tsk, tsk, tsk!

Yup I drove all the way across town to have dinner with some friends tonight and yup it was worth it. You really do have tons of options to choose from. I mean they had crab legs, chinese bbq ribs, Mongolian bbq, steamed asparagus, green beans, orange chicken, crab won-tons, you name it. I am licking my lips as I type, remembering all the yummy food that I had.   The young lady that was taking care of us was really friendly and we all got 15% off of our meal due to the coupon that we had so double score. If you live in the area, try this place out. The food is plentiful, the staff are friendly, and the price is just right. Its a triple win situation.

Great happy hour and a too die for ruben dip appetizer that I wanted to beg the chef to give to me. (although I didn't I believe I can re-create it just  fine and maybe even tweak it a bit) The waitress (who's name escapes me right now) was fabulous and did I mention they have a kick ass happy hour. On Wednesday happy hour is pretty much all evening so double score! I will definitely be back to visit them again soon even if it is just for some of that tasty ruben dip!

This place is absolutely beautiful. Seriously. Not really sure what else to say. The trails are awesome (albeit be careful as you can get lost) Plenty of parking and there are bathroom facilities. All a win in my book. If you haven't checked out this area, please do so. You will not be disappointed.

OMG! Postino's went above and beyond for me on my birthday and I cannot even begin to thank them enough.   See they do not take reservations on Sunday's because it gets crazy busy with their brunch and it is just a very popular day. Plus rain was in the forecast for Sunday which was going to make space even tighter. However I called up Postino's on Saturday and spoke with Troy # 1 and told him that I was coming on Sunday with about 20+ people and asked if there was anyway he could help me out. Hmm he says, let me get your number and I will call you back when I can figure out something. So about an hour later he calls to let me know that he can't reserve a table for 20 but that he can can hold at 4 top for me and as my party comes, we can seat them as needed and as long as their is not a wait. Deal!!!!   So Sunday arrives, I go to Postino's and Troy # 2 lets me know that Troy#1 told him about me and my situation and that he was there to take care of me. :) YAY! so we were seated at our 4 top, and soon after, we were able to take over another table, then another, until we took over the entire back booth area as well as one 4 top that was close by. There was a couple, Sandy and Mike, that was sitting in the back booth who were so very sweet. We pretty much took over their area to the point that by the time they got ready to leave, they had gone from sitting in the middle of the booth to the very end of the booth. My friend Deb bought them each a glass of wine because they were so very generous and just all around great people.   Now everyone told me how fabulous their bruschetta was and they were right. I only had a few pieces because I wanted to I talked to everyone and make sure that they were having a good time. But I will be back to enjoy an entire board by myself. Ok maybe not by myself but still, it was damn good. The wine I was drinking was also excellent as well. Hats off to my friend Deb for picking a fabulous red for me. You are the best.   Special thanks also goes out to our server TJ who rocked it for us all afternoon. He made sure everyone was taken care of when it came to food, drinks, etc. Thank you TJ!!!   I truly enjoyed myself and I will be back again VERY soon. Thank you again to the entire staff at Postino's on Central for making my 35th birthday extra special.

Last night, I met some friends for all you can eat sushi at Akaihana. It was $24.95 for just about everything on the menu. There were a few items that were not included but believe me, it was only a few. The place was packed as they had been offering this deal all day. It only happens a few times a year, usually around the holidays so you have to be in the know as its not advertised unless you of course frequent this place on a regular. A friend of a friend is a regular customer there so she not only knew all about it, but she even has a roll named after her and they know her by name. (Try the Karen on the menu, its  very good)   It took awhile for our rolls to come out as again it was packed and there were only 3 sushi chef working, but once they started rolling out it was all hands on deck. I don't even remember what I ordered anymore because I was greedy and had way more than I should have. (It was all you can eat you know)  But I do know that the rolls were huge and here were plenty of them. If you check out there menu online its only a small snapshot of the actual sushi menu as its pretty extensive. I will be back to check out their happy hour in the near future.

Myself and my friend Soraya stopped here after finishing our wine making/labeling over at Casavino. We were starving after all the work we had to do ( not really lots of work but starving nonetheless) We noticed it and decide, why not? It's cute.  OMG!! This place was awesome!  From the time we walked in and sat down, everyone was very friendly. Our waitress, who's name escapes me, was fabulous. She told us about all the specials, let us know what was on happy hour, and even gave us her favorite picks and most popular dishes. We decided to order the appetizer for two which included the most amazing bruschetta ever, calamari that was fried to perfection, fried ravioli and the biggest pieces of mozzarella and tomatoes I have had in a long time. We also decided to split the Mussels in Marinara that also came with penne pasta. OMG it was so good and we had more than enough to share. We got pizza crust to eat before the meal and I swear it took everything in us not to devour it all before our meal came. We each ordered a glass of wine and I swear it was a very generous portion. Even better is that they the classes of wine ended up being on happy hour. SCORE!  This place is seriously a little gem. They have a cute little patio that is covered and has heaters for the winter so I can imagine how gorgeous it is in the spring. If I lived closer, I would definitely put this place on rotation. The portions were generous and the service was spectacular. If I am in the area again, I will definitely stop again for more eats. Seriously delicious!!!

I feel so bad for the reviewer before me as I have had great experience every time I come here. A very good friend of mine who is Serbian introduced me to this place and I have been hooked ever since. The owners are actually from Bosnian and their food reflects that and everyone has always been really nice to me every time I have come by.   I am addicted to the Cervapi's which are little sausages that are grilled with a chopped onions and served with a sour cream mixture and bread that is placed over the meat as it is grilling. YUMMO! along with the Burek which are the meat pies, sirnica is the cheese pie, or zeljanica is the spinach pies that are made with the phyllo bread. They are huge so be warned!  Give this little place a try and remember that it is a Eastern European restaurant with menu items reflecting Bosnia, Serbia, and Croatia to name a few. Just say zdravo! which means hello and hvala which means thank you!

I cannot believe I haven't done a review on this place. I have been to this location as well as the one out in San Tan Village.  I came to an happy hour here and let me tell you, there $2.95 happy hour appetizers were yummy. The portions were huge as well. There were about 7 of us and we ordered the calamari, the crabcakes, spinach and artichoke dip and the Beef Carpaccio. All of them were quite good. I love me some calamari and when it is made just right like this order was, it takes everything in me not to eat it all! We also ordered a few bottles of wine and for the life of me, I cannot remember what they were but they were good bottles of red. A friend of ours picked up our tab which was especially sweet. (Thanks Frankie!)

Dear Brio,  After giving you such rave reviews back in 2009, you have kindly let me down in the most unexpected way. See I do understand that you do not take reservations for happy hour, and I totally respect that. However the fact that I came to give you a courtesy head's up that I was bringing around 40+ people over the three hour time spam for my birthday happy hour a week in advance and you kindly but adamantly let me know that you could not accommodate me left me speechless. Your friendly manager kindly explained that he did not want a "rowdy" group and that he wanted to keep everything orderly.  He let me know that no I could not hold two tables once I arrived and that my party would be seated separately as they came in to keep everything orderly. So no standing around and being unorderly, et al. Again the look on my face was priceless. Last I check I was almost 40 and my friends don't get "rowdy" but ok whatever. However I still had a friendly smile and thanked your manager for letting me know that in so many words he did not want my business and that I needed to find a new venue.  Yea hmm wow. No worries. I found another place that welcomed me with open arms for my birthday happy hour and they don't mind if we stand around and get a little "rowdy".    Love, Ebs

Great little place. I was there for a wine tasting with the Arizona Wine Bats last night and had a blast. The owners are really nice and very accommodating. Although I didn't try any of the food, from what I could tell, every seemed to thoroughly enjoy it. The have a very nice wine selection for you to try and buy by the bottle at very reasonable prices.  Definitely a nice little place to go for a quick drink or before a night out on the town. Give it a try :)

A friend and I decided on this place last night for dinner and after picking it out of a hat (not kidding) because we couldn't exactly decide where we wanted to go and we are happy that we did. We got there just in time to snag the last booth at the bar because no sooner were we seated then there was a line out the door. Whew.   They have an happy hour from 3-7 and from 9-close daily and we got in just in time to snag a drink from happy hour as well as an appetizer. The appetizer we chose was the pulled pork nachos and let me tell you they were HUGE and very good. Their was tons of nacho cheese, pulled pork, bbq sauce, sour cream, and guacamole. I mean whoever made ours layered it just right so that dang near every bite had some cheese, meat, and bbq sauce. The pulled pork was nice and hot, very flavorful and not fatty (I have had some fatty pulled pork), the bbq sauce was tangy but good. Different for me as I like sweet bbq sauce and this one had vinegar base that was actually really good. Plus they ended up being half off because it was still happy hour. SCORE!!!!!   Next we ordered the three meat combo to share and the meats we choose were the brisket, the tri-tip and the St. Louis ribs with onion rings and sweet potato fries. WOW.. My friend really like the brisket and I thought it was just ok, but the tri-tip pieces we had were cooked medium and they were so juicy and flavorful with that nice slow cooked smokey taste. The St. Louis Ribs were juicy and smokey as well and you could taste the dry rub that that used which was really good. They put just a little bbq sauce over everything and gave you a side of it as well, but there is a bottle of bbq sauce if you want more but we barely used it as the meats were just that good to us. Everything was served nice and hot including our onion rings and sweet potato fries which were sprinkled with cinnamon and served with honey mustard sauce. YUM!   We ended up packing up half our our dinner and small portion of the nachos as were were stuffed! So stuffed that even as I type this up, I am still full from last night. Must have been those yummy nachos because I only tried one small piece of brisket, a small piece of tri-tip and one lonely rib! lol.   Hats off to our waiter Ryan as he knew his stuff and made great suggestions. He was friendly and checked on us regularly to make sure we were ok. Thanks Ryan!

I went back to good ole Bad to the Bone tonight and saw my usually gang, Ryan, Russ, and Jeff (Hi guys). They are still the best waiter, bar tender, and manager ever.   Anyway I ordered my usual which is the pulled pork nachos. They teased me as its a huge portion and I was eating alone but I gave it a shot anyway. Something was different about my nachos this time around. They had beans in them. Now before someone gets their shorts in a bunch, I have ordered these nachos about three times and I have never remembered beans being on them.  I was a little disappointed because they didn't taste as good as usual, and although Ryan did offer to have them remake them for me, I declined as it was happy hour and I could just pick around it.  I did take home the leftovers and I am not sure if I will eat them or throw them out but we will see. You will eat just about anything when you are hungry.  All in all I still had a good time and yes I know I will still go back and yes I will still order the pulled pork nachos, I will just make sure no beans are added.

I use to do take out from this place when I lived on the west side. It was about $9 for their buffet take out and they gave you a container and basically you filled it up until you couldn't stuff it anymore, which I graciously did. I found a place on the East side that reminds me of them and the food is just as good. Plus I always had enough for leftovers for the next day. Call me greedy but hey, it is a buffet and its ok to be greedy from time to time lol.

Very cute consignment shop that Jill C goes to on a regular basis. Oh and get this, it doesn't smell funny. You guys know what I mean (when you walk in and it has a weird smell) They even put the retail cost of all the items on their tags as well so that you know you are getting an awesome deal. I was even able to convince Jill B to get this lovely diaper bag that retailed for $79 and I only paid $20 for. The bag looked practically brand new. Score for me and her! If you like consignment shops like I do ( most of you know my obsession with Goodwill) head over to this little gem of a place and you will not be disappointed.

Mahin is GREAT! A friend of mine had a girls night in back in February, and as a extra surprise, she hired Mahin to come in and teach us some belly dancing techniques. It was so much fun. Mind you were were all a little tipsy and full from eating so Mahin made us work off all those extra calories by making us work our hips. She taught us some basic steps that were very easy to learn as we were able to show off our new moves by doing little dances of our own. Mahin even performed for us. She is AMAZING!!! AMAZING! At the end of the night, were able to purchase the hip scarf we used. It was a great night and extra fabulous treat courtesy of a GREAT friend. Thanks Mahin!!!

So I finally got to visit Lolo's to see if they were as good as everyone said they were. It was pretty busy, which is not uncommon as I am sure that it is always busy. I got seated pretty quickly because I was dining alone so kudos for me. I was quickly approached and asked for my drink order which was red kool-aid of course! WOW can we say sweet. I forgot how sweet kool-aid could be as I haven't had any in YEARS. But it was good though and brought back some great childhood memories.   My next challenge was trying to decide what in the world I wanted to eat. So many choices. I had changed my mind about 4 times by the time the waitress came over to me. I wish I had gotten her name because she was very friendly and not overbearing. Me likey. Anywho, I decided to go big and order the KK, which is 3 pieces of chicken, 2 waffles, grits, and 2 eggs with cheese and onions. So after about 20 or so minutes, my food arrived and let me just say my eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach.   First off the grits, now those ain't no instant grits! They came in a little bowl with a BIG gob of butter. Man they were so good. I had to move all that butter off to the side as it was a huge mound, but the grits were hot and oh so good. I had to add sugar to mine as that is how I like them and that make it even better.   The eggs were good. Just scrambled with some cheese and onions. Standard. Nothing fancy about them. Nice and hot.   Now on to the chicken. While the skin was nice and crunchy, it was a little salty for me. But between the sweet kool-aid it balanced out after awhile. Not bad, not bad at all.   The waffles were good, but I was slightly disappointed. I think mine were a little too soft. I like them just a tad bit more crunchy on the outside but still soft. Kinda hard to explain, but they were not bad at all. They too came with a big gob of butter. I swear, I wonder how much butter do they go through each day let alone each week and year!   I ended up only eating part of my grits, all of my eggs, one piece of chicken and half of a waffle. All the rest came home with me for a snack later.   The ambiance of the place is nice, but I do wish the little flat screen TV that they have in the upper left corner was bigger and more centered. It seems so lost in that wide open space that they have. I also wish they had at least two stalls in the bathroom as there was about a 10 min wait for the ladies room. Other than that, not all bad. But know that if you are in a group and it is busy, you will have wait to be seated and the food takes awhile so be patient! Oh also know that if they are really busy, they will stop any take out orders. I witnessed people being turned away who were there for take-out only. I also watched as all the workers repeatedly washed there hands after handling just about any and everything. I saw my own waitress wash her hands about 5 times in the course of me sitting there. Very nice!!! (May sound like a weird comment but its good to know that they are hygienic)

Well it only just opened this week and from what my fabulous friend who picked up a yummy pizza for us last night stated, " I am happy I came in when I did because if I would have waited 5 more mins, it would have been a very long wait as that place was packed! Not a single table was open when I walked out with our food"  Not bad for the first week huh?  We had a mushroom, ham, pepperoni, cheese pizza that was cooked to perfection. The crust was thin but not cracker thin like some places. There were tons of mushrooms, ham, and pepperoni sprinkled all over the pizza. The cheese was gooey and yummy (is gooey a word?) As a matter of fact, I had either a piece of mushroom, ham, or pepperoni in every bite. We pretty much finished off the large pizza, which was cut into squares and not slices (which I am a fan of by the way). Very good pizza if I do say so myself.   Now the wings we had, well they were ok, but I will give them another try at later date. I mean they weren't bad, but I have had much better.   They do offer deep dish however they are still waiting for their pans to come in in order to make that dish. (Remember they only just opened this week) They do not offer delivery just yet, but seeing as its lets than 2 mins away I would need to be smacked if I asked them to deliver. I can be lazy if I want to dang it!   So give them a try if you are ever on this side of town. You just may be pleasantly surprised.

I never knew this place existed. Three of my fabulous girlfriends and I decided on this place for dinner and it was a good choice. Cozy little spot where if you cannot find parking in the front, then you can park in the back and come thru the back door. It may seem weird, but believe me, it is much better than parking in the back and trucking it all the way around to the front to come thru the front door.   We were seated immediately and the waiter brought us some water and some yummy for my tummy warm bread with a side of olive oil mixed with balsamic vinegar. One of my favorite combos. We ordered a bottle of wine that I am not even going to pretend to know what it was called but man it was pretty tasty. We then ordered antipasto, the arugula salad, meatballs, farmers pasta, chicken parmesan and another dish that escapes me but was wrapped in cheese, spinach, with marinara sauce. (What can you say, we were hungry and we were doing it family style) Very good. We did end up getting a free dessert which consisted of chocomisu and some cannoli. OMG! Not only was the food good but the dessert was just sinful!! Sinful I tell you.   The only negative about the place was that service on the food was a little slow although it was pretty packed so I will take that into consideration. Luckily for us, one of the girls knew the owner and kind of mentioned it to him, needless to say he made sure we didn't wait any longer than we did and gave us the free dessert. Score!! I will definitely be back because the food was really good and I hear there happy hour is pretty decent too. Check them out if you are in the neighborhood.

Believe it or not, I am ONLY giving this place two stars for the fabulous company I was with and the decent food however the service left alot to be desired. Otherwise it gets a ZERO!   So after arriving (albeit I was a little late by like 10 mins) my party had already been seated and we had been chatting for about 13 mins before anyone had acknowledged us since everyone had sat down. Why do I know it was 13 mins? Because one of the ladies in my party happened to notice the time and made a comment about it.   We were finally able to flag down a waitress, who in turned flagged down another waitress, who in turned flagged down yet another waitress to take care of us. Geez?! Finally one waitress seem to take pity on us and we were able to order our food just 10 mins shy of happy hour which ends at 7pm. What happened to the initial waitress that got water for us before I arrived and gave us bread, we will never know as she was never seen again. ( and no she was not the busgirl)   Now we each ordered appetizers and pizza. Nothing too complicated right? Que 25 mins later, (now I was timing it) and only one person had received their appetizer. I finally flagged down the manager and asked him if it was normal practice to take 25 mins to wait to have appetizers served and even longer for our pizzas to be served? We didn't want them to come out at the same time as that defeats the point of an appetizer right? He was friendly enough and apologized profusely and then proceed to the kitchen where ta-da our appetizers were just finishing up and double ta-da, our pizzas showed up about 10 mins later. (SMH = Shaking my head)   The calamari was ok but there wasn't enough of it. It had more fried zucchini than calamari which was funny as I ordered a calamari appetizer. The roasted chicken pizza which has gorgonzola, onions and apricots I believe was really good, but I only at one piece as I had eaten most of the calamari/zucchini appetizer and frankly after waiting so long, I had lost my appetite some.   Will I go back? Probably not. The funny thing about this entire situation is that everyone was really looking forward to eating here and it wasn't even busy!! You would swear it was a Friday night with the service we had. Oh well, everyone can have an off night and apparently tonight was theirs.

Military men in uniform, check. No sales tax, check, lots of shopping, check, mom spoiling you rotten on your visit with the items she purchased for you, check, check and check. I am so very thankful that I cannot shop at the Exchange or Commissary more often as I would really be broke. Hmm... now maybe if I meet someone who is in the military... :)

I have only done the take out buffet and I must say that the food is pretty good. I do pack my container until it is bursting at the seems but for $10 I want to make sure I get my money's worth. (Yes I am greedy but hey at last I can admit it) One of these days I will actually sit down and do the buffet but for now, take out buffet it is!

I am basing my review off of the free 8oz frozen yogurt I received today during their Grand Opening promotion. VERY, VERY Good. I was able to mix two flavors so I got cake batter and just chocolate. Can I say just yummy?! The staff were very friendly and kept the line moving very quickly seeing as it was out the door at when I got there around 4:30pm.  Oh and they were extremely generous with their portions. Double yum.  Will I be back, hmm YES! I mean hello, it is frozen yogurt and it was pretty darn tasty.

My husband and I's experience was great from start to finish. Juliana was our coordinator and she made sure that everything was taken care of from day one. Our limo picked us up from our hotel and took us down to the courthouse to get our marriage license. the driver waited patiently as we took care of that as well as some items at the venue.  The day of the ceremony, our limo driver was prompt and  the staff could not have been nicer or accommodating seeing how busy it was for the day after Valentine's Day.  Heidi, our officiant was amazing and she seemed to know is even though we had just met her that day. Our pictures turned out amazing and we are so happy we were able to purchase them. It was a great experience that we will cherish forever!

Some friends and I went to see "This is It" at this movie theater back in October. Although I knew where this movie theater was, I had never been here.   I arrived early as I just knew this place was going to be packed. I mean it was only the second night that the movie was playing so plan ahead right? Well not quite. Although we already had our tickets, if you wanted to purchase one you had to go inside to the concession stand to get it instead of purchasing your ticket that the ticket counter outside. Very different. It was pretty empty in there. I mean there were a few customers around, but it was not your usual busy movie theater. We proceed to go to and pick out our seats and let me tell you it was pretty empty in there too. There is no stadium seating however everyone that was in this particular theater (I think there were maybe 50 people and that is being very generous) everyone seemed to make sure not to sit directly in front of anyone else so no to block their view which is good for me because I am kinda short :) The woman's bathroom that I found was on the other side of where the actual theater I was in and it had that scary movie feel as like I said, the place was empty and going to that bathroom made me think of some crazy random scary movie scene taking place in the bathroom. (I have seen way to many scary movies in my life)   I am still amazed that it was not busy at all. Their matinee prices are $5.00 before 6pm and $7.00 after 6pm. On Friday and Saturday the price is $7.50 after 6pm. I have no idea how this place is still in business if it is always that slow, but for the prices its a great place to catch a movie. Just remember that it does not have stadium seating (at least not in the theater I was in so I can only assume that others are the same) and watch out for spooky bathrooms if the place is empty.

Unlike my experience at the SS office, this only took 30 mins to complete. I like this location because it is very clean and they get you in and out as fast as possible. Case in point, I had barely had my number in my hand before they were calling me to take my new DL picture. I literally was rushing over to the desk. So needless to say the next 25 mins was me waiting to be called and only about 5 mins for her to process me a new DL with my new last  name. All in all a great experience that I hope not to have to repeat anytime in the near future.

My friend Emily is in town and was looking to go to good wine place with good food. Well I said, let's try 5th and Wine since I have heard great things about this place and I have been dying to come. Sold!!!   We arrived and were seated immediately. The decor is really nice in this place. Laid back couches, red and black chairs, huge patio. I mean it looks and feels really swank. Love it! Our waiter John came over immediately to introduce himself and to let us know that he would be taking care of us that evening and that he did.   We started off by ordering some wine. Emily had the Petite Syrah I believe and I ordered the Red Knot (one of my favs). Both were excellent (we each ended up having two glasses so you know they were good) We then ordered the prosciutto, mascarpone cheese , figs and tomato jam bruschetta and the peppercorn-crusted steak, with creamy horseradish bruschetta. OMG the prosciutto one was definitely the favorite of the night. Not to take anything away from the peppercorn - crusted steak bruschetta because it was delicious as well, but something about that prosciutto mixed with that creamy texture of the mascarpone cheese followed by the sweet figs and the tart tomato jam, YUM! We each ordered the same entree which was the brie stuffed chicken and figs and lets just say that is when the meal started to semi- fail.   Now John kinda warned us when we ordered this dish as he said it was getting mixed reviews so to let him know how it turns out. I should have known better. I will say that the potatoes and the green beans were very tasty and the chicken was juicy, HOWEVER when you say that a chicken breast is going to be stuffed with brie and with figs, you kinda expect that. The chicken breast was stuffed with brie but only at the very end of the chicken breast. As far as figs, its not figs, its fig jam and its used very sparely like the brie. We even found out the the chef only puts a small tablespoon of brie in the brie stuffed chicken. Hmm that is not stuffed. If you are going to advertise it as brie stuffed chicken, make sure that the brie is throughout the chicken and not at the "butt" of the chicken breast. I kept cutting into it and was like where is the brie? I was almost done when I found it. Semi FAIL!   Needless to say Scott V. heard that I was not exactly thrilled with the dish and that I was going to review this on yelp (Thanks John :) ) and he came over to personally apologize. I let him know that the dish was good, I mean we both finish our dish, however it was not as advertised. There was nothing stuffed about that chicken breast and just take off the fig and just leave the fig jam as there are no actual figs in the dish. (fig jam does not count as figs) So to make amends he offered to buy us dessert. Dang that man knows my weakness and it's dessert. We ordered the ghirardelli brownie with vanilla ice cream and raspberries topped with a drizzle of chocolate sauce. OMG that made up for the chicken. It came out warm and it was truly divine!   All in all, it was a great place. The live band that was on the patio was jamming, the staff were friendly, the wine and even the food was delish and the company was awesome! (Thank you Emily) I will definitely be back to 5th and Wine VERY soon.   Side note: Thank you again to John our fabulous server and Scott V. for the lovely dessert and for listening to me voice my concerns.

Me and the Ladies (as our tab was named) were spoiled rotten by our bartender Jonathan! Seriously the service on Saturday was unbelievable. We were there for about 5 hours I believe and we had a grand ole time. I mean it was $2.00 wine by the glass day (as it was the 5th of the Month) and the bruschetta boards were as yummy as always.  Thank you so much 5th and Wine and an extra special thank you to Jonathan for putting up with us for 5 hours! You and the team ROCK!

What the heck? I have not written a review for this place yet? WOW! I will say this is my go to place for Chinese food when I am craving it and not wanting to drive to one of my favorite spots especially since it is less than 5 mins away from my house. I was CRAVING some chinese last night so I decided to order some pork Lo Mein, crab and cheese wontons and hot and sour soup. OMG, that was the best Lo Mein I have had in a long time. Either that or I was seriously hungry which I wasn't. I ended up eating all of it was is very unusual for me. I was saving the hot and sour soup to have for dinner to day and I must say I was slightly disappointed as I tasted it and it was not as spicy as I would have liked. I order this soup extra spicy all the time, especially when I am not feeling well. So I had to doctor it up in the hopes that it will be nice and spicy for me later.   If you are in the area, give this place a try. I seriously do enjoy the food here and the girls are always nice to me. Next time I will order in person (for my hot and sour soup at least) so that they it is me (they always laugh when I order it extra, extra, spicy) but hey it is a great cure for colds!

After not getting a meal at another spot this morning, we headed over to IHOP in hopes of FINALLY getting a meal and they did not disappoint. I mean Jared took such good care of the 8 hungry women that came barreling into the place. It took all of 30 mins tops to get our food and that is from the time we walked in, sat down and ordered. Thank goodness as I am not sure we could have taken any more restaurant disappointments.   Eggs, bacon, coffee, hashbrowns, pancakes. What more can you ask for? Fast, piping hot, cooked just right. SCORE! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Especially to Jared! You rock buddy!

I have been a few times and yet I guess I have never written a review. It is a nice laid back little place and would be great for a date night. Their mac and cheese as well as there beet salad is delicious and even better if you come during happy hour. Same for the drinks, they can be pricey but they are very good. If you are in the area, come and check them out. It can get busy but again it is a great place for a date night!

I had the pleasure of hanging out at Revolver this past weekend and man was it a good time. When we first got there it was a little dead however it didn't stay that way very long. It was like one minute it was just a few people, I turned my back and had a fabulous drink and the next thing I knew this place was jammed packed. We had a couple of issues at the bar with the bar hops pouring out our drinks before we were finished and pretending like they didn't know what we were talking about. That irked me to know end and they really need to work on that. If my drink is half full, that does not mean throw it out. We did have a very friendly bartender, who's name escapes me right now. I will say she was the most friendly of them all, unlike a few others who made if seem as if they were doing the customers a favor by getting them their drinks. The drinks that they were paying for. Just wow....   Anyway the DJ was on point. I mean he was jamming from the time we got there until the time we left. We couldn't stop dancing all night. So aside from a few hiccups the club was pretty cool. If you have to go to the bathroom go early because just like the wait outside the club, the lines get crazy after about midnight.   PS. I will definitely be back again soon!

Not all Danny's Car Washes are the same that is for sure. I like going to this particular location because they really do a good job on my car. I find it that if you go early, like when the first open, they are EXTRA attentive to your car. There have been other locations that no matter when you go, they just don't seem to do as good of a job as this location. Sad but true.  So if you are able to visit this particular location, my suggestion to you is go early. :)

11 wines to try, one wine to make for $44. Say what? Yep that is what me and my girl Soraya did last Thursday evening. She had purchased a Living Social deal for up to four people for $88 to make our own wine. We got to try 11 of the wines but the last wine we tried was for purchase only. It was a Port that I swear would make a great marinade for some beef because it has a distinct taste that would make a roast extra yummy.  The first two wines, I loved because they were sweeter. They mixed alot of their wines with some very nice flavors. Very unique. There were a few reds that I liked but not so much the whites (except for the first one) We ended up making a batch of the second wine which was a sweeter Pinot Noir. It will be ready in about 8 weeks or so and we even get to make our own labels to put on our bottles when we come back. We will end up with 4 bottles each since it was only the two of us. Not to shabby if I do say so myself. Brandon (Hi Brandon) was very knowledgeable and extremely patient with us.  I am looking forward to coming back to pick up our batches of yummy wine. I may even buy a bottle of that port I was telling you about.

I am giving this place two stars and they all go to Frank. More on that later.  So I walk into this AT&T store to see the newest phones they have as I am in need of upgrading my phone. It is not overly busy but you would expect some to at least greet you within about two minutes of being in the store. I mean I have walked into many AT&T stores in my years and usually within a minute, someone comes to ask if you need assistance. This store, NADA. I walk around the store and while checking out phones, I notice that other customers that have come in after me have been greeted and are being helped. Me, still nothing. 15 mins later, one of  my friends comes into the store to find me and I mention to her that I have yet to have anyone acknowledge me in this store but whatever. I was looking for a specific phone so she goes up to one the sales men and ask where this brand of phones are located, he shows us and proceeds to walk away before I could ask questions. I am like really? Man, if I was a secret shopper this store would FAIL!  So we left.  Fast forward to about an hour later, and I go back to this store seeing as I was still in the mall and my phone was acting up. Again I walk in, it is not busy at all, and again no hello, no nothing. However I proceed to walk to the back and get a huge smile and hello from Frank, who is one of the service techs. (Hence the two stars) I am like wow, thank you for that warm greeting. It is a shame that I had to come all the way to the back of the freaking store to get a hello. They then proceed to call the manager Mario (as I had told them what had  happened when I came into the store an hour earlier). He apologized profusely for what had happened and assured me that it would not happen again. (hmm right) I will give Mario credit as after all this, he did take the time to answer all the questions I had regarding a few phones that I was interested in including the new IPhone, but both stars still go to Frank for that wonderful smile, greeting and help I received, even though I had to go to the back of the store to get it.

Quick, cheap, and always fresh ( at least when I go) I always try to go after 1pm as it has slowed down from the lunch rush. The food is still fresh and the staff are always friendly. I have even gotten the kids meal with a large ice tea and believe it or not, that fills me up as well plus its a little cheaper.   All in all, its Panda Express. I mean what more can you ask for? Quick, cheap, done.

Yup five stars!! Charles and his associate B (my apologies for not properly hearing his name) came out to my place after my AC stopped working on me. They analyzed the problem on my 30+ year AZ unit let me know the good news and the bad. The good news was that it was the motor, the bad news was that they did not have the part on their truck and would have to order it. I was immediately heartbroken as I had already survived almost 48 hours with no AC, but I figured  heck what was another 24 hours.  Well Charles worked his magic because he as able to get the part for me the same day and came back after doing a service call to personally take care of my old AC unit. After much tugging, blow torching, you name it to get the rusty bolts and probably nails off, he was able to open up the AC unit and replace the motor and put everything back together again. Now Tada!! My air is blowing the lovely cool air that I remember thanks to Charles and his associate B!. You guys as well as the rest of your staff are the best. Thank you so much for taking suck good care of me. You went above and beyond and I am forever grateful!

Blue moon @ happy hour is $2.50. Sold!!!   Funny, that coming from a woman who drinks wine alot and is not a true beer lover, but I do love me some blue moon. When I found how cheap it was on happy hour as well as looking over the menu I was sold. Well I must credit the boyfriend as he was the one that said, I want to go there. So off we went.   It is a cute little place and I must say I was a little concerned when I pulled up because there were no cars in the parking lot. Hmmm not a good sign I thought. When we walked in, there were a few tables occupied and I was like eh, who cares, we came for the food. Our fabulous and friendly waitress (who's name I cannot remember) :( came over to greet us and take our order. Again I was bouncing off the walls because of the blue moon happy hour special. I mean anywhere else and it is $5 a glass unless you find a rare place that also has it on happy hour. They came served in small mason jar and the BF was like hmmm what the? I can't hold this, its too dainty for me. I swear lol.   So on to the food. I ordered the stuffed burger that was essentially two big ass patties stuffed with peppers, mushrooms and bacon. Just greedy!!! BF order the bbq platter that came with brisket, pulled pork, baby back ribs and beef ribs. Good lord that was alot of food. I am still amazed that I ate my burger as you really can't take it home to eat it as leftovers and there was no way I was leaving any. BF on the other hand ate all the pulled pork and brisket but couldn't eat any more as the portion was huge so needless to say, I have ribs to eat for dinner later. Score for me.   Oh and kicker to this, I happened to check in on YELP and ding, ding, ding, we ended up getting a free dessert! I truly had no room for it and yes I should have saved it but alas we got the strawberry shortcake to top off our gluttony for the night and it was delicious as well.   So if you happen to be in North Phx, check out this place. It is cute and small, the waitresses are great, the portions are big. Win-win in my book.

Two words. Restaurant week!! (and review # 200)  Ok so after scouring over the long list of places to try during restaurant week, I picked RnR as my first place to try as they had three different offerings to choose from and each offering was paired with a drink. They were The All-American, The Healthy Heart and The Polished Palate. I could go into great detail regarding each one, but alas, I will only talk about the one that I ate and do an honorable mention of my boyfriends choice.  For my selection, I chose the The All-American which consisted of a yummy and huge Apple Gorgonzola Salad , Ancho Baby Back Ribs w/parmesan fries which had a bbq sauce the reminded me of Famous Daves Devils Spit (oh so yummy), a huge slice of New York Cheesecake, and I generous pouring of the a Cult Cabernet Sauvignon. Yes folks, all of this was included for $30. I could have chosen the Filthy Millionaire Martini as my drink but alas, I am not a huge fan of dirty martini's and the cab was delicious. Wait let me take that back, my entire flippin meal was delicious! I ended up bringing home half of my ribs and cheesecake because I was STUFFED!!! My boyfriend chose the The Polished Palate, which consisted of Cheese and Charcuterie Plate, Blackened Salmon, Double Layer Frosted Carrot Cake and his drink choice was The Samurai. We were actually "fighting" over the desserts because they were so good. I actually threatened bodily harm if he dared drop what was remaining of mine as we walked back to the car lol.   So if everything was so wonderful, why only 4 stars? Well the woman's bathroom smelled as if it had sewer back up problem. I went in their twice and it just smelled bad. Yes I know what does that have to do with the meal, but hey I look at everything. Does it mean that I won't come back? Hell no! I will be definitely be back soon, especially to try their breakfast.

RNR! Thank you so much for making sure my birthday happy hour went off without a hitch. To making sure I had reserved tables, to separate checks, to EVERYTHING! I am so very appreciative of the entire staff and everything you did to make sure it was seamless. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!!!

I swear I wrote a review for the now closed Pink Pepper Thai and now it is MIA. Weird and interesting.... Tara Thai and Pink Pepper Thai are one in the same just a different name. I am here at least once a week ordering something different for take out. The staff are extremely friendly and the food is fantastic. I have tried to order something different every time I have been there, just to work my way through the menu. Of course I have a few favorites like the Drunken Noodles and the Tom Yum Gai. I have had almost all the appetizers as well and they are all excellent. Definitely a place to check out if you are in the area. They have a buffet on Monday - Sat that I have yet to try but one of these days, I will partake. Hmm what to order next??.....

So I was finally able to go to Tara Thai for their lunch buffet special. Let just tell you that WOW!!! That was some buffet. They had so many of my favorites from the drunken noodles, pad Thai, panang, Thai sizzling steak, crispy chicken with spicy cream sauce, crispy calamari, which by the way is not on their regular menu and oh such much more. So many options. I was in Thai heaven. For $11.86 which included the buffet and some Thai Iced tea, I was one happy camper. It feels good to know that I have become such a regular that as soon as I walked in, I received hugs from the staff and they were happy that I was there to finally try their buffet. It was well worth ever penny and I can't wait to come back again.   FYI their buffet is Monday to Sat from 11:30 to 2:30 and the total price is under $10.00. If you leave hungry than that is your fault!

Me and some girlfriends met up for dinner here this past Sunday night. The hostess was so gracious in trying to hold a table for us but alas a few members of my party were tardy so we ended up by the fire pit area which was very nice. Our waiter William a.k.a Billy was AWESOME! I swear he went above and beyond the call of duty that night.  Sunday nights (and day for that matter) are half off bottles of wine. Between that and their awesome menu, what more can you ask for. I ordered the Vigazz burger which was huge, messy and oh so good. Top that with a side order of sweet potato fries and I was in heaven. All the ladies seemed to enjoy their meals as well, from various sandwiches to the warm apple cobbler that another friend ordered. I am not a fan of cooked fruit but let me tell you, that was some good tasting apple cobbler.  Billy evenly split all our bills up down to the wine. I swear he was the best. I do prefer this location over the other as it is bigger and you are able to spread out. If you happen to be in the area, definitely stop on by. I doubt you will be disappointed.

YES, I am only give Five Guys 2 stars! Can you believe it? Me, the woman who raved about having a Five Guys in the area. The woman, who LOVED, LOVED, LOVED Five Guys when I lived in Virgina. This Five Guys does not even begin to compare to how they do it in VA.   I was so excited about getting a burger and fries today. I mean I was "cheating" by going for a burger and fries instead of working out. Walking into this Five Guys I was excited. The staff were friendly, the place was spotless, and they were getting orders out fast. So I ordered my little bacon cheeseburger with jalapenos, mustard, grilled onions and mushrooms and a order of regular fries. About 7 mins later I was out the door and headed home. The food smelled heavenly in the bag and I couldn't wait to get home to devour my meal.   I get home, open the bag and grabbed a few fries. Yum, we are off to a good start. I dig to the bottom of my bag and grab my burger. I slowly unwrap it, take a bite, and say WTF? Where is the meat? I swear that burger lacked flavor and meat. I mean I remember when even the little burger was still to big. Yes I know that the little bacon cheeseburger means it only comes with one patty, but does it have to be the thinnest hamburger patty ever? I mean McDonald's even has a bigger burger than this sandwich did. I was so disappointed. The best part of my sandwich was the bacon and the toppings since the actual burger was more like spread. At least I had enough fries to feed myself and two friends and they were pretty good.   So two stars. One star for the fast friendly service and one star for all the fries I could eat and for the bacon on my burger. Otherwise you get a big fat FAIL!!!!!!! I may give you a chance to redeem yourself in a few months but the next time I go, you had better bring it!   PS I ended up going to work out anyway since I was so disappointed! FAIL!

Five guys, you are still letting me down. You are nowhere near as good as you were in VA. I gave you another try tonight and all I can say is WHERE'S THE BEEF? Your patties are so thin and it appears that the only way I will actually be able to taste the burger on the bun is if I order a regular cheeseburger which consist of two patties. I should be able to order a little cheeseburger and still be able to taste the actual burger. I will wait another six months or so to give you one final try here in Arizona before I give up on you all together. Sad, just sad!  PS Your fries are still pretty good and the service was great but your burgers here in Arizona really do leave something to be desired .

I do miss the old days in-which they still used coupons and discounts. I used to come out of there with bags of stuff for extremely cheap. Although there new deals are good, they just aren't what they use to be. All in all, you can't go wrong shopping at this location. The staff are pretty friendly and helpful and it is hardly every overly packed, even on the weekends. Win-win in my book!

Two words. Happy Hour!! Amazing happy hour. Everyone was right when they talked about how good the food was and with the yummy appetizers being $5 and huge portions. SCORE! My girlfriend and I were trying to figure out exactly what we wanted and if we could have, we probably would have ordered everything off the happy hour menu, except for the beet lollipops. I mean really? beet lollipops? I know you shouldn't knock it until you try it but I despise beets. Blech. The hummus was delicious, the calamari was fried to perfection and there was lots of it and the bbq flat bread pizza. YUMMO!  The place was packed because there was a Toys for Tots going on the same night so it made for great people watching. I am happy I got there as early as I did because seats were hard to come by at around 5:30pm. I will definitely be going back to for happy hour real soon.

I come here to people watch. I mean it seriously would give a comedian some good material. With that said, I have been coming here for years for my annual picnic with my girl Jill C. They have really cleaned it up by redoing all of the Ramada's' and such. The park is very clean (although you had better bring your own soap of you go to the bathroom. Learned that lesson after our first trip) There are tons of activities you can do. We have watched numerous wedding photos being taken, a obscene number of picnics over the years. I am telling you, people watching at its finest. I enjoy coming and will continue to come as long as they keep up the great work!

Although the neighborhood looks a little suspect, the bowling alley is nice, clean, and the staff are friendly. I was here for a ynpn phoenix event and everyone seemed to have had a good time. I may have to come back with some friends and do some more bowling. The bar even has happy hour from 4-7, so come drink, bowl and be merry!

Great service! I unfortunately had some damage to my windshield and needed the entire sucker replaced. The good was that they were able to get me in fairly quickly, the bad was that I was stuck there for 2 hours because I had to let the glue dry ( not a bad thing but this place is not close to anything and it is not by any means the fault of the techs) Luckily there was free wifi and  some great shows on TV that made the visit go by very quickly. They kept me informed of everything that was going on which was great. I have used Safelite before to repair a chip and I will definitely continue to use them in the future.

Sigh... this place I swear. It never fails to call my name when I am on this side of town and I just have to answer that call. I am a little confused as to why my original review is MIA? Hmm.. At any rate, this place is the BOMB.com. I mean who doesn't like alcohol infused ice cream that is made fresh daily? Who let's you try two different flavors at a time with the double side spoon? I mean seriously! I have been there more times that my check-ins actually state ( I cannot tell you how many but it is way more than 2!) Lee is fantastic and very patient when it comes to letting people decide which flavor's they want. Why just last night I was there and I had some AMAZING Cherry Pop Irish Whiskey and some Rocky Road!! Sweet baby Jesus I was in ice cream heaven.   Until my next fix, I will just cherish my lovely memories.. hmm yummy!

Sunday happy hour 4pm to 7pm! I am there. I mean the prices were GREAT! The appetizers were all half price and the drinks depending on what you got ranged from $2 to $5. I had a mini crabcake sandwich, which also came with fries, a glass of blue moon and a noshed on some pretzel sticks that my friend order. OH DEAR LORD! I was either starving or the food was that good. Considering the fact that I just finished trying to ice skate (which was pretty comical) I will say that I was hungry. Everything came out piping hot, our waiter was great and the company I was fabulous. I will be back soon to definitely try my hand at bowling, preferable during happy hour of course!

Yup still a fan. I have been back here so many times and everyone really is pretty nice. I still have not bowled but I have watched others have a grand ole time at it. Me, I come for the yummy sliders, pretzel sticks, and the fries. Although I have had to send my fries back on a few occasions because they have come out either cold or not fresh, meaning that you can tell that they had been sitting out and they tried to re-fry them to make them fresh. FAIL! You try to pass out refried fries to a fry freak like me. Just won't work buddy but good try.  All in all, its a great place to come and hang out and eat and drink for pretty cheap. Maybe one of these days, I will actually bowl.

I never knew this movie theater existed. I mean I don't frequent paradise valley mall that often, and when I go, I have tunnel vision as I go straight to the stores I need to go to and get the heck out of there. So when Travelzoo had their movie special ( two tickets, 1 large popcorn and two large drinks for $15), I couldn't pass it up. The theater is small but very quaint. The seats are EXTREMELY comfortable and they kinda recline. How cool is that. Plus the best part? the staff are super duper friendly. A huge win in my book. I will definitely be going back to this cute little hidden gem of a theater.

Ok, ok I bite my tongue. I have been here way more times than my check ins say and it has been great every time. I know I was not to sure at first but they have been good to me. The food, the service, the drinks ( Thank you Haley for the newly crowned Ebony drink lol) Seriously, great people, great drinks, great food, and great company. What more can you ask for?

OMG!  I cannot believe it took me so long to come down to the cute Boutique Solie! I wanted to buy all the earrings, bracelets and purses she had but I refrained and bought a cute pair of green earrings that were just calling my name. ( I really wanted the entire earring rack but again I refrained)  It is set-up so nicely with an upstairs and downstairs. A variety of items from jeans, to dresses, to purses, to earrings, necklaces, to hats, shirts, to you name it. Beth is the owner and she is AMAZING! Talk about having an eye for style. Sigh... I wish I had an eye for style. Ok, ok back to the Boutique.. for those that like to get spray tanned, she has that option as well. If you are in the area, make sure to check out this amazing Boutique. You will be SOOOO happy you did!

I read all of the reviews for this place and most people hated it while others were like meh. It actually had me worried that we would not have a good time. However me and my group of friends had a BLAST here on Saturday night.  The DJ was excellent, the drinks were overflowing and very reasonably priced plus everyone was dressed up and extremely friendly.  ( Guest including staff) We seriously had a blast dancing all night for a friend's birthday. The weather was gorgeous so standing on the patio when you needed a some fresh air after all that dancing was perfect. All in all, I will say will be back again one day soon.

I went to Beckett's Table on a Wednesday night with the fabulous Aileen B. I was dying to try this place because she made my mouth water after reading her review. The pictures that on on yelp do not do this place justice. It is alot bigger than it appears and it is wide open. They are also already expanding the patio after only being open for a few months.   We started off with some drinks, I had the classic painkiller which reminds me of a pina colada and you do feel like you are on a beach somewhere sipping on a cool refreshing drink. Aileen had a glass of white wine which for the life of me, I cannot remember but she did enjoy it and that is all that counts. We ordered some mac and cheese and roasted brussel sprouts as an appetizer. OMG! People always seem to not enjoy the yummy goodness of brussel sprouts and believe me, this brussel sprouts were extra yummy. They were roasted to perfection and had shaved manchego cheese, pancetta, and had the sweet taste from the yummy lemon thyme vinaigrette. I am still drooling over those brussel sprouts as they really were that good. The mac and cheese was also divine. It was the creamy white mac and cheese with little bits of pancetta sprinkled very lightly over it. Between the brussel sprouts, mac and cheese and the warm house bread with the honey butter, who needs a main course? ME! duh.   So for the main course, I decided to order pork osso bucco. I was so excited about it because I had read how great it was in Aileen's review and I just had to try it. Well, unfortunately it was not all that great. The osso bucco was a little dry to me and I found that I am not a fan of spatezle as it had no flavor to me at all. I literally was moving my food around my plate like kid to make it seem like I was eating it. Aileen ordered wood fire mussels and she said they were good but needed a little bit more salt. I am not one to return my dish if I am not happy, but when our lovely waitress Rebecca came over to ask how the meal was, Aileen (bless her heart) let her know that I was not enjoying it. Rebecca asked if she could get me something else, but since I had my heart set on this dish, I politely declined. Well, to our surprise, Rebecca came back a few minutes later to let us know that they were not only comping the dish, but they were giving us the death by chocolate dessert as a treat. WOW! I was floored. That was very generous of them. The dessert was fabulous. Warm chocolate cake with a scoop of ice cream and a oreo cookie that was dipped in white chocolate. Yum.   The drinks were delightful, the brussel sprouts were heavenly, the mac and cheese was creamy, the dessert was sinful, and my company was fabulous! Even though I did not like my main course, I will definitely be back to try something else as the service was great and they went above and beyond. Extra, extra special thanks to Aileen for inviting me and to my surprise treating me to dinner for my birthday.

So while perusing Beckett's Table FB post, I had noticed their menu and decided to check it out. After looking over it with a fine tooth comb, I realized their Brussel Sprout dish was missing. I immediately commented about it on FB and said how sad I was that it was no longer a menu option. Fast forward a few days later and they posted They're BACK!!!! Woohoo!!! I was so excited. I mean me, excited over Brussel Sprouts. Yes indeed!!!   Fast forward to last night, after the Yelp Help's event. I figured since I was in the neighborhood, I might as well stop on over to have my fill.  I got there, scored a fabulous parking spot, and propped my booty up at the bar. Before he could even ask what I wanted to drink I blurted out Brussel Sprouts. Poor guy. I knew he wanted to laugh but instead he was like ok.. I will get that in for you but would you like something to drink? I giggled and declined since I had been to a wine making event before the Yelp Event (busy night)  Fast forward what seemed like 5 mins and bam, my brussel sprouts were in front of me. The waiter that served them to me even asked if I had called them in because they were ready so fast. I said nah, but maybe someone in the back heard me when I blurted out Brussel Sprouts? lol. OMG they were so delicious. Crispy pancetta, little crispy burnt (in a good way) brussel sprouts. I was in vegetable heaven.  I chatted it up with another bar patron, paid my bill and was out the door in maybe 30 mins flat. I really did just come in for some yummy Brussel Sprouts. What can you say, its an addiction! I will definitely  be back again as long as they are on the menu :)

It is weird that I do not have a review for True Food Kitchen, seeing as I know I wrote one for their fabulous bison burger I inhaled ( hmm I mean ate slowly) over a year ago. I was just here again last week literally days before my lovely friend Melissa had her beautiful baby girl Isla! We had a chance to catch up while she enjoyed a huge bowl of Panang Chicken curry and I once again snarfed down a bison burger with half kale and half sweet potatoes ( I will admit I only ate half my burger and took the rest home to enjoy the next day). I swear if you have not enjoyed a bison burger from True Food Kitchen, your a really missing out. It is a lean cut of meat and it was cooked medium rare. Topped off with some onions and a little mayo on a Parmesan flax seed bun and washed down with Pomegranate limeade sweet baby Jesus I was in heaven! Ok now that I have made myself hungry once again, scoot your booty on over and check out their menu. It is healthy and good for you so that in itself lets you know that you are already winning before you place order!

My mom and and I practically had the entire theater to ourselves this past Monday afternoon. There were 6 of us total in the entire theater. You walk in, pay, pick which seats you want to sit in, and the rest is history. The fresh carmel and cheese popcorn they were making smelled and tasted fantabulous and the seats were extra comfortable. This would be a great movie theater to come to for a date night.. Hmm. :) Plus if you want, you can order food and drinks from your seat as well. Score!!!!

I cannot believe I had not been here prior these past two weekends. Although I would love to get one of the coveted seats in which you can order food 20 mins into the movie and it includes popcorn, a blanket and it reclines, the regular seats are just as comfy. I see why they are not able to bring food during the movie in those seats as they are very close together and it would drive people crazy. Although I will say this is why I enjoy their cheaper competitor that will not be named. All in all, this is a GREAT date night place to go to a movie. The seats really not  much more than a regular movie seat although the food prices will leave you saying WOW! Will I come back? Absolutely. Definitely give this place a try if you haven't already!

I had no idea this place existed. Decent lunch hour prices as well as happy hour. Make sure that when you say you want something spicy to emphasize that you really want it spicy. There version of extra spicy was pretty weak.

Dear Tanzy,  Today you sadly disappointed in the service you provided. I spoke so very highly of your brunch buffet with unlimited mimosas, but sadly things did not go as planned.   Let me start by saying that although the day ended not as planned, all of your staff were quite nice, very friendly, and extremely apologetic. I arrived on time and checked in, and I let the hostess know that my dining companions were running late but I still wanted let them know that I was there since I had made the reservation ( which by the way was cancelled on opentable after I checked in but that is another story) .  5 mins later another dining companion arrived and we were seated while we waited for others.  (FYI there was a total of 8 of us including my friend's daughter) Kevin our waiter introduced himself and let us know that he along with another waiter would be taking care of us. Score!  We get to fabulous men to take care of us. We were offered the endless mimosas but were SADLY informed that the brunch buffet that was once before offered was no more and that a new menu for brunch was being introduced.  I was so disappointed as that was the main reason why I had picked Tanzy as I had raved about the brunch buffet and how good it was.  This should have been our queue as to what was to come.  Fast forward to around 11:30 and the rest of our party finally arrived. Everyone was happy to so each other and Kevin came by to offer the unlimited mimosas and again let us know that he and another waiter would be taking care of us. Cool. 10 mins later we are ready to order and regretfully our waiters are no where to be found. 20 mins go by and we are still waiting for our waiters so my friend went to the hostess desk  to ask where our waiters were and the hostess herself graciously came over to take our orders. But then we wait, and wait, and wait. We see other tables that came in after we did, get served there meal, eat, and leave. We even asked a party that was across from us, who came in at the same time that we did, if they had even ordered yet as they appeared to be waiting just as long as were were. An hour and 15 mins later ( not kidding) we finally say we are done. I go and look for our waiter and say please cancel our order because we are leaving.   The manager comes out and apologies and comps our drinks but we were still disappointed. I am not sure what happened today but after speaking your praises   you let me down as well as all my girlfriends. Will I be back? Maybe but it will be awhile. Seriously  Tanzy, you dropped the ball today.  Love,  Ebony  PS Bring back that yummy buffet please!  Update 11.12.12: I received a phone call and an email from the General Manager Michael  today. WOW! Thank you for both the call and email. You went above and beyond what I expected. For that I give you 5 stars ( but I won't change the stars on this particular review) But again just wow, thank you!!! See I told you guys that the staff was great! :)

I happened to walk by this cute little shop while browsing the shops over in Happy Valley and it immediately caught my attention. I mean for one it had free samples of bread and olive oil waiting for you to try. Sweet lord!!! I was in olive oil and balsamic vinegar heaven. Dawn was so very friendly and she explained to me that they opened about 6 weeks ago and how the process of their shop worked. They get their olive oils and vinegars from all over the worlds and the olive oils are rotated out often. The oils also range from very mild to very robust in flavor. Their were olive oils infused with wild mushroom, basil , chipotle, and garlic just to name a few. They also have these wonderfully 18 year aged balsamic vinegars that were out of this world. The fig and the black cherry were pretty good but my absolute favorite was the lavender balsamic vinegar. Dawn had me try it with a little bit of the basil extra virgin olive oil and it was so good, I ended up buying a bottle of both. They were so not on my grocery list but they were really that good. Plus those of you who know I like to cook know I will definitely be experimenting with these.   If you happen to be in the Happy Valley area, and are exploring the shops over at Norterra, stop by Olive Creations. They also have different mustard's, olives, and jellies that you can also sample while you are there. Oh I forgot to mention, you can sample every single olive oil and every single balsamic vinegar so you know exactly what they taste like before you buy it and the prices are very, very reasonable. So all my chefs in the AZ area, go check this place out,, purchase a few things, and then call me so that I can come over for dinner!!

This store is like a drug! I cannot get enough of the yummy balsamic and olive oils. My latest haul includes a Persian lime olive olive oil and coconut white balsamic vinegar. Mix those together and marinate some shrimp in it. Baby can you say GOOD!!! Oh and I am also still in love with the Lavender balsamic and the Basil Olive oil but I think I may have a new second favorite and that is the Violet Balsamic. It is similar to the Lavender but has a distinct flavor that makes you go DAMN that is good. So many different flavors, so little money! LOL

I am so disappointed in the experience myself and friend had last night. He was so excited about taking me here because he said the pizza was some of the best he had ever had and he knew how much I like trying new places.   We arrived at around 9pm and it wasn't busy. We were greeted nice enough and asked if we wanted to sit in the main seating area or the bar area. We choose the bar area so that we could also watch highlights of the game. We got a booth, the waiter in the next booth over saw us sit down so it wasn't like no one knew we were there. A waiter took care of a table two tables behind us and another waiter took care of a table that was seated one table to our right. Again nothing. We even watched as 3 waiters congregate around a table to chat it up but again nothing. After 15 mins we decided to leave. Yea we waited 15 mins. My friend was more disappointed then I was only because he felt that he had talked them up and he felt like he let me down. I told him no worries as it was there loss. I was there to hang out with him anyway. The pizza would have just been a bonus.   Will I be back?  Probably not anytime soon. I wish I could say that it was because they were so busy. Oh well.

I had the honor of hanging out with three lovely ladies after stopping at Filmbar for a happy hour. We were STARVING so I looked up restaurants close by and The Arrogant Butcher was agreed on by all parties. After wandering aimlessly for parking (damn you Phoenix Suns for having a game) I was able to secure a parking spot and sashayed on over for some eats.   We were greeted and seated immediately. The decor I must say is very different but nice. I was fascinated by their lamp shades. ( I know silly but hey I was) We started out with the crusty bread and olive oil however we had no plates, but we dug in anyway (an let me just say this was some damn good bread) Our waitress was like hmm would you guys like some plates for your bread? Hmm yes please ( ya think) lol  We all ordered something different from the sweet potato tortelli, yum, the turkey sloppy joe, which had a slight kick but not as spicy as you would think, fish and chips, and of course my dish which was black mussels with pommes frites. OMG! My dish was actually on the appetizer menu and let me just say I was in heaven when my dish arrived. It had the most mussels I have have ever had and the fries were just perfect. There were even bits of pork shoulder as well as cloves of garlic throughout the dish. Sweet baby jesus. Now mind you I was full, but I ate every last bit as it was not like I could take any left overs home. I liked it so much that I am contemplating going back ASAP just to have some more, so yes it was that good. A word to the wise, if you order a side of chicken let it be known that it will be a small portion for $4.00. A very small portion. (that is all)  The service was good, the company was freaking fabulous and the food was divine. They even validate parking (thank goodness) so it made it all the better. An all around win in my book.

This is a very hip, swanky, cool place. Like others have said, you would not know that there was a movie theater in this place because of the set up. I was here for a girls only happy hour and we had a great time. The even offered to extend the happy hour for us ladies for the time we were there. How cool is that.  The only downfall is of course that there is no food, except for popcorn, but you they will let you bring in your own food or even order out. Not too shabby. (just make sure to clean up after yourselves lol)  I may come back soon to see one of the movies that are playing and to get that experience as well, but I liked what I saw so far and that is win in my book.

I really wanted to like this place as I heard good and bad things about it. Maybe last night they were having a rough time, but alas here is my review.  I met other yelpers here for pre-theater dinner. I will say there were about 20+ of us give or take at various tables. At the larger table of about 12, for some reason they just couldn't seem to get it together. Drink orders got mixed up, food orders came out very late or not all. Yes you read that right, not at all.  It got to the point that we were scrambling to eat the food some of us did receive and pay our bill to get out of there to catch the show. The table across from us, the entire party came in later than we did ( table of 6) and yet they were served there drinks, food, and checks in a very timely fashion. (and yes they were part of our group)  I will say this, the food that we did receive was good and the staff was friendly enough but still it does not make up for the service. The restaurant was not busy and we had reservations so it was not like they didn't know we were coming  which makes this even more puzzling. Maybe I will try again if and when I am downtown and just sit at the bar. Maybe it was the fact that we were a large party, but again the restaurant was not busy. Maybe they were just having an off night.

It's Zipps! The service was just as good as the one in Scottsdale. The fries were just as tasty and the wings were just as hot. This location is brighter which is a plus and their appears to be more seating? Or maybe it is just their set up. But again it's Zipps!!

Gotta love this place. Small quaint venue. Up close and personal. Get there early to get good seats. Be careful as the also automatically add 15% gratuity to each check and yes there is a two drink min. Luckily for my waiter I not only forgot about the automatic gratuity but I also tipped him again. He was worth it so a win win for him. Check this place out of you get a chance. There really isn't a bad seat in the place.

Plus delivers these decadent cupcakes to you personally! Now that is service!!  Dang it, now I want a cupcake!!

I am embarrassed to admit that I stuff my bowl to the hilt with food. Greedy yes but I want to make sure I have enough protein and veggies and the bowls seem so tiny. (Hey I said I was greedy) the service is always pretty good and the selection for you to choose is great.  Needless to say due to me being greedy, I always have leftovers. At least I am not alone when it comes to stuffing my bowl as I have seen others that are 10x worse than I am. Join their Genghis grill club for some awesome deals you can receive on your bowls.

I stopped in her after doing the downtown wine walk. Everyone was extremely friendly and I couldn't have been more appreciative. I ordered the drunken noodles to go and maybe that was my mistake. When I got home, my noodles were all clumped together which is not how I remember drunken noodles being. They meal itself seemed to lack a little flavor and was just kinda bland. I ordered mine with chicken and I swear I had a veggie drunken noodle with a touch (like one to two pieces of chicken) in the entire dish.  I wasn't exactly thrilled so I touched up the dish myself with a few more seasons and I added some leftover chicken I had to salvage the meal. I will give 5 stars for service and 1 star for the meal itself. Maybe it was an off day?

* WOW! How can I possibly be the first one to write a review for the new Stingray Sushi in Scottsdale Quarter? YAY ME.   Well I was there last Friday for Happy Hour. As always get there early because by the time we left, that place was PACKED! The bar area is nice. Small inside and very nice outside, but alas, until it cools down, inside is the way to go for me.   Drinks - They have great drink specials on happy hour. Their Geisha A-Go-Go martini is fresh watermelon with grey goose! Double score as that sucker is delicious!!   Sushi- all their rolls are good. We had every roll on their happy hour menu except the california roll and let's just say the sushi was fresh, and melt in your mouth good.   I think our entire bill came to maybe $40 which is pretty cheap for the three of us that were there. I will most definitely be back to visit this location, especially since it is right around the corner from my job :)

Like other reviews stated, it is not the cardio room but it is on the Spa side. Although it was advertised as opening at 6am, there were a few mornings they opened early just for me since I was standing in the doorway looking helpless lol ( thank you) It really is a nice spot with enough weights as long as it is not crowded. They have a few machines as well for you to use if needed. I was in there to use all the weights they had after running on the strip. I think I surprised a few people by telling them that as they looked at me like I a deer in headlights. At any rate, I will definitely be using this spot again when I come back to Vegas for work.

Not too shabby. I will say that the DJ on the Friday I was there rocked it out with all the latest and greatest Motown hits. The burrito I had (because I was starving) was pretty good and my malibu and pineapple was a-ok. I will have to try out the live music one of these days, but for now, you get a decent four star rating in my book!

Packed!! That is the best way to describe this place on a Friday night. PACKED!!! Plus it was early too. By 7pm it was already standing room only. It was first Friday so I expected it to be busy, and boy was it. I can say that it was people watching at is finest and some of the patrons were down right RUDE however, I still had a good time. The drinks were good and strong ( 2 for 1 making my di'sarrono and orange juice the cheapest and strongest I have had EVER and the price was perfect! Win in my book)  The band that was playing was jamming out however the DJ was not the best. It did not stop us from having a good time nonetheless. Please note that once you leave, you can't just walk back in if there is a line. You will have to stand outside like everyone else and wait. I will give the owner made props as there were people who appeared to be his friends trying to give him money to enter and he turned them away and said they had to stand in line like everyone else. Kudos in my book. The place is a little small so like I said before, get there early! I am sure at this rate, he will be finding a new location soon to accommodate his growing clientele. I will have to come back on a not so busy day to try the amazing food I have heard about.

I was craving some pad thai and I wanted to find a spot closer to my house. So I hit up yelp and ding ding, I found this little gem thanks to my fabulous yelpers.  I drove on over and ordered a pad thai, thai hot and specifically asked for the spice level to be a 10 as I like it very, very hot. The guy that took my ordered told me that he was just like me,  the hotter the better. While awaiting my order, I looked around and it is an nice little place. I may have to come back and check out the buffet sometime but I can tell that it probably gets packed in here fast as it is small but quaint.  So about 15 mins later, my order is up and the gentleman at the bar told me how Pete roast his own cashews and peanuts, as well as makes all his own sauces from scratch. He says just in case your pad thai is not spicy enough, here are a few sauces for you to try. I was in spice heaven.    I get home and get situated so that I can dig in. OMG it was a great, great portion. I have enough leftovers for today and probably tomorrow that is how great of a portion it was. The pad thai was excellent, but the spice level was maybe a 6 at best. I was slightly bummed but then I did have the extra spice sauces just in case so all was not lost.   I will be back again as I am happy to have find a spot closer to me that is actually good. Lord knows I love me some Thai food!

What a great lounge to go to after dinner. The DJ outside on deck was playing some tunes I hadn't heard in a long time and you couldn't help but either sing along and dance or even say " yes that is my jam. Oh and let us not forget the live band that was playing inside. *side note: you could not hear the band inside while sitting outside and vice versa. Loved that" *  Back to the band, Vaughn Willis and the band were on fire! It was a great way to end my 40th birthday celebration. Great company, great dj, great band, great drinks, one hell of a good time!

I stopped here the day before Thanksgiving to pick up a few supplies for dinner the next day. Everyone was so super friendly and helpful, especially Tiara who was handling the tastings. She clued me on a few tasty treats like the veil espresso vodka and fennellys irish cream. Then on the champagnes like Jaillance and Satorsola Asti. Yummo! I could have stayed at the tasting area all evening but alas I had to get home to make pies. Thank you Total wine for your outstanding service and   low prices. Plus with the friendliest staff ever, what more can I ask for?

There is a guy that I am dating that really likes this place. So much so that we come at least once a week and the waitstaff are starting to take notice. He orders the same thing every single week, and me, I like to go rogue and change it up. At the rate we are going, I will have tried everything on the menu soon. So far my favorite is the BBQ chicken that only the fabulous waitress Melissa knows how to order for me. Every time I try to order via another server, it always comes out WRONG, WRONG, WRONG! Their croutons (yes croutons) are delicious as they are made fresh daily every single day. I am a little obsessed with to the point that I only want my side dish to be one HUGE salad with a ton of croutons. Oh and don't forget about there fresh baked rolls. There have a been a few times in which they tasted stale. Not sure how that is even possible but it has happened. I will say that as long as I am dating this guy, this place will be on a constant rotation. SMH! until next time....

It started off kinda bad. I arrived on time for my solo dining experience (that I also made a reservation for) and was seated immediate by James ( who also ended up being my server later). Well after I was seated, I waited, and waited, and waited until after 10 mins, I decided to get up and leave, but Mario intercepted me before I walked out as he had noticed that I had been seated but no one had been helping me. He apologized as he was the one that usually seats all the customers and he promised that if I would have stayed, it would be well worth it. It actually took some coaxing as I was so excited about my dining experience and the 10 min gap left a bad taste in my mouth. So after thinking about it for a few mins, I decided to stay since I had driven across town for dinner.  So back to my table I go and James also comes over to apologize for the mix up. It's ok, I say, I am just hoping the food is worth it and James assures me it is. So I start off with a glass of velvet devil merlot and a three meat meatball appetizer that consisted of pork, veal, and beef with ricotta over cream polenta. Dear lord that was yummy. I swear had I been at home I would have probably licked the plate.  My main course was the Black Tagalini made with white wine sauce instead of red sauce ( am not a huge fan of red sauce and they changed it up for me! YAY). It was black homemade fettuccine with shrimp, clams, mussels in a white wine broth. It even had a nice little kick to it. Had I has some bread, I would have soaked up the remaining broth with it and ate it as it was that tasty. I wanted dessert but as delicious as all the desserts sounded, I just wanted some good ole fashion baskin robbins ice cream.  I am very happy that Mario convinced me to stay and I am very thankful to James for taking good care of his solo diner on a busy Saturday night. I will definitely be back, just not on Saturday evening and maybe not alone lol.

Wow. So I finally got a chance to try this place out last Friday. Num Yummy! I just happened to be in the area and I made a point to make sure to stop by and I wasn't disappointed. There were like 5 different options and the one I chose had the onions, garlic, cheese, et al. Believe me it was a touch decision. They whipped it up for me in no time and I was out the door. Now mind you I decided to drive all the way home to eat my yummy nachos. Mistake as they smelled so good. When I got home and opened my container, at first I was a little disappointed as it appeared to be alot of nacho chips. However upon consumption I realized that I ended up needing all those yummy chips too. (Especially the next day when I finished off the leftovers)  Sweet baby jesus this was some good eats. Needless to say I will be coming back for more real soon to try whatever the may have on their menu, (which changes daily if I am not mistaken) If you happen to be in the area and are craving some good nachos, give them a try. You will not be disappointed.

Dear Ryan! On behalf of Team Beall, we cannot thank you enough for putting up with 15 rowdy ladies and one rowdy man yesterday. As the DD for a few of the ladies in this group, I witnessed everything you witnessed while sober. You put up with the ever changing music request, listened to us sing at the top of our lungs, take countless pictures, and yet did it all with a smile on your face and never once got mad is amazing.  We cannot thank you enough!  This was an epic experience that if you and some friends can do, I highly recommend. We started off at Brat Haus to sign out waivers, take pictures, and we were on our way. Pedaling through the streets, singing at the tops of our lungs, waiving at EVERYONE, even dancing when we could on a beautiful Sunday afternoon was just what we were hoping for as well celebrated our friends 34th birthday. I think what made out group extra unique is that we each had on custom made shirts in our of her birthday ( myself being dubbed Hot Chocolate with the 13). We stopped at Coach House, Boondocks, and Patties was our final destination since we stayed at Boondocks for so long. ( There was one other bar whose name I cannot remember and we were supposed to stop at Gilligans, but again we were having way to much fun at Boondocks) Everyone was super nice and accommodating of this loud and rowdy bunch. We got tons of high fives, people taking pictures of us on the bike (mostly due to the shirts we were wearing) and just and all around great time. Like I said before, if you and some friends and get together to do this, I highly recommend. Make sure to ask for Ryan!!!

This is a really nice park. I have been coming here for the past few years to walk as one entire loop around on the sidewalk is a mile. The police department is also there so it makes you feel extra safe. I know that there are many  kid activities such as football practice, soccer practice, you name it, happens here especially during the spring, fall and winter months when the weather is nice. Many people have picnics here as well as bring their pets out for a nice leisurely walk. If you are in the area, check this place out. Go for a walk or have a picnic.

First off, this is a hidden gem that I cannot believe I did not know about! I mean I have lived in the area for almost 10 years and I don't know how long they have been around but I am sad that I am just now learning that they exist. I was here this past weekend after my workout with my fabulous friend Lauren who said " hey wanna get breakfast and bloody mary's?" Hmm YES PLEASE!! Soul Cafe has the best bacon bloody mary's I have had to date and Sean, the fabulous bartender (who also gets extra love for being a Cowboys fan) took great pride in making those delicious drinks for us. However let's not forget the food as I had a dish called "Some Like it Hot:, which consisted of the best savory cakes, extra crispy bacon and eggs I have had in minute! I wanted to be greedy and finish all of it but sadly I couldn't. Taking it home was not an option as I am not a fan of reheated breakfast. I also learned that they reprint their menus weekly I believe as it changes that often since everything is fresh. How cool is that? Will I be back? You bet will! If for nothing more than to sit at the bar and drink bloody mary's!

Picture this, 12 hungry people wanting something for dinner on a Tuesday night. Me being the person in charge of selecting a restaurant for said hungry people and hoping that everyone is happy. Enter Cask 63. OMG!!!  Words cannot even begin to express how happy everyone was. It was a work dinner and you know how hard it can be to make everyone happy. Cask 63 delivered and then some. It is a nice swanky looking place that would make a great date night for those that are thinking of taking someone out to a special place. (hint hint)  First and foremost I must give a huge shout out and thank you to Tracy for being so very patient with me and for making sure my reservation was all set up. Anthony, our fantabulous server for the night was phenomenal!!!! I mean the man went above and beyond to make sure were taken care of. To the rest of the staff and crew, thank you so much for making our dining experience extra special.  Ok now let's get to the food. OMG The food!!!! From the warm brie, to the calamari, to the shrimp cocktail in which the shrimp looked like mini lobsters to the oozing with yummy goodness flatbread. How on earth did we save room for dinner?  Yum!! Let us not forget the bread that cam out piping hot. The pretzel bread was the favorite of course. All that was missing was the mustard ( so said my coworkers) . The Ladera (sp) wine that Anthony suggested after he patiently let me do a mini taste of about four of them was right on point. ( I am a Cabernet  girl, what can you say lol)  Everyone was happy with everything that they had. I had the Seabass and it was cooked to perfection. Light and airy set on top of some risotto with just a little bit of lemongrass broth. I ate all of it!! Except for the asparagus. ( I love asparagus but asparagus doesn't love me) The sauteed spinach with huge shavings of reggiano. Can I just say that I am sad that I shared that? Let us not forget the sweet potato fries. They were some of the best I have had in a long time.  Then the desserts. I ordered the creme brulee which was melt in your mouth goodness. Others ordered the smores which had peanut butter ice cream. Did I mention that everyone, and I do mean everyone was VERY happy?   So will I be back? HA! Of course I will. Everything was very reasonably priced and with the staff like Anthony and Tracy, why wouldn't I come back? :)

I never knew this place existed seeing as I never get up this way. The park is very spacious with a cool little train that you can take your kids on as it takes a mini tour around the park. It is very easy to reserve a gazebo area if needed and depending on the size you want, you can have your pick. All in all, I will definitely be back again with some friends to have a picnic soon!

Words cannot even begin to express how thankful I am for everything you did for me today. My birthday happy hour was a HUGE success thanks to the wonderful staff at Sol Cocina.  Sharon, thank you so much for making sure me and my guest had plenty of places to sit and mingle. That area was PERFECT! Lorena, girl you took care of about 40 people in a 3+ hour time frame! You ROCKED! Thank you so much. Josh, OMG Josh! Thank you so much for putting up my "rowdy" group LOL!  Seriously, your entire team welcomed me with open arms and everyone had a great time. The food and the drinks, OMG the drinks!! Thank you to Sol Cocina for keeping the Farmers Market-Strawberry-Kiwi Margarita on the menu for me for that extra day. It was DELICIOUS!! ( I stopped at two but I really wanted three) Up next... Taco Tuesday anyone? :)

Like everyone has said, it is hit or miss. Some prices are great ( produce, bulk items,   stuff like that) But other items, the prices are like WOW?! Are you kidding me. It really depends on what you are looking for. I have been here a few times now, mostly for the bulk seasonings and a few of the produce items. I am not sure if I would buy anything else, unless the prices are just hard to beat. Best times to go are early in the mornings as it gets crazy crowded later in the day.

Why have I never used this place before? I mean I was in and out in 5 mins! Now I know that may not happen again, but it was definitely is worth it to pay a little extra not to have to sit and wait all day long in the MVD/DMV or whatever one wants to call it. Check them out. They do just about everything....

Very cool spot. I mean who doesn't like sitting by the pool, listening to great music, sipping on some drinks with some fabulous friends? Plus the people watching alone was worth it. Oh and don't let me forget about the $10 unlimited mimosa special they have on Saturdays from either 10-2 or 11-2. Either way it is worth. However, if you want the best damn pina colada ever, get one from here. They coat the rim of the glass with honey and roasted coconut and they are strong! Wow! Momma likes!!! This will be a definite go to spot throughout the summer.  A few tips - First the bathrooms are really dark so ladies be careful if going in alone. Second - get there early or you will be SOL. It cost a nice penny to sit on the chairs that have an umbrella. ( I believe someone told me it was $300 for the Cabana and like $150 for the chairs with the umbrella. Are you kidding me?) Third- Do not bring your drink in the pool unless you are sitting poolside. They frown upon that as they don't want pina colada and beer floating in the water ( I can see that)  Otherwise its a good spot!

I have been at this convention center for a convention a total of 8 times ( 7 with one company) and let me tell you, that take great care of us. The staff go above and beyond to get whatever we needed. I have had the pleasure of working with most of them for my past 7 tradeshows and I look forward to working with them in the future.

I was able to visit this place during lunch about two weeks ago. It is a nice spot and can be hard to find if you are not sure where you are going. They have free valet parking during lunch  hour which is great.  This place look great! It is like you are entering someone's farm type home with big tables with non-matching chairs (which I love!)  The lunch menu is slightly limited and you cannot order anything off the dinner menu ( we tried and were politely turned down lol) I cannot remember what everyone else ordered food wise but I do know that they loved drink which I believe was called the Indian Summer. (everyone that ordered one had two before the day was over ) I had the sweet tea vodka and lemonade which was delicious. The best Arnold Palmer I have ever had that's for sure.   For lunch I ordered the spinach salad and added the blackened salmon. I had to actually as for a new piece of salmon because it was way to salty to eat. Now before people get on my case, I have had blackened salmon before and this was by far saltiest I have ever had. They were gracious enough to remake it without salt and it was perfect.   Make sure to order some of those yummy fries because they were ADDICTIVE! Our entire table were practically fighting over the last few bites of fries. I swear my coworkers are crazy!  I will definitely be back to try their dinner menu as it appears to be tapas. Plus it would be cool as a cozy date night!

So many options! I love coming to Goodwill because you can pretty much get an entirely new wardrobe for cheap. Half off Saturdays are my favorite as I can really stock up on some great items. Lately I have been truly blessed in finding items that still had the original tags on them  and being able to snag these items for around $4.50 each. Score!! Every Goodwill is different and I do check out a few of them, but I do enjoy coming to this one as it is a little bigger. I do wish they had more dressing rooms but all in all, you can't go wrong at Goodwill!

I do miss Sunflower Market as there prices were a little bit cheaper than Sprouts. Nonetheless, it has not stopped me from shopping here as it is very convenient to where I live. The produce is always fresh and sometimes they have a sale that you just can't pass up. ( Case in point me buying 8lbs of strawberries for $7.97. Hey I freeze them and use them in my smoothies lol)   All in all not bad but again I still miss Sunflower Market and there cheaper prices!

All Goodwills are not alike. Sometimes I come in this particular one looking for one thing and leave with five other items I didn't know I needed. This is one (just like all of them) has a particular smell about it but not in bad way. I have had some great finds in this Goodwill since it opened and it is conveniently located near my job. Please continue to drop off your donations so that I can continue to find items I didn't know I needed! :) Thanks!

What a cute, quaint little place. It is located in the DC Ranch area, tucked away in the shopping plaza. If you blink you will miss it because it really is tucked away. The set up is really nice, tight but nice. I was here for lunch so I can imagine how romantic it may be for dinner. The food was delicious. We had some of the best calamari I have had in a long time and my coworkers raved over the french onion soup. I ordered the brie, ham, pesto and tomato sandwich (hold the tomato) it was was melty, cheesy, goodness. I was so full from all the calamari that sadly I couldn't finish it all but I did take it home and it was even good cold. All in all a cute place that I look forward to trying again for dinner.

It was alot of fun, albeit cold, very very cold. Crowded, but not uncomfortable. If you are looking to see any animals then you are out of luck as it is at night. You will see a few camels and the kimodo dragons sleeping but other than that, you are only there to check out the wonderful light display that they have going on. It cost a little bit more on the weekends ( $14 a person) plus if you want to go any of the rides they have, those cost extra as well. I will say that the hot chocolate was delicious and worth the $3.49. Oh and parking is free but you will have to walk a ways if you get there late as the lot near the zoo fills up fast!

I am bummed that I did not know about this place until last week. Sushi on a conveyor belt on plates for $2 or $3 per plate? YES PLEASE! That way I can be greedy but on a budget. The place was packed at 11:30am ( it opens at 11am) so that was great sign. We had a GREAT table right next to where the sushi was literally being made and coming out. So needless to say we got the freshest plates first ( not that all of it wasn't fresh as it was) From the unagi to the las vegas roll, to the crunch roll, to the edamame, I mean I could go on and on and on.  So if it was so great, why only 4 stars? Getting your cup of water refilled along with trying to pay for your meal was a little hard. It was like they didn't want me to wash down my sushi or pay for it lol. All in all I will definitely be back to visit again real soon.

So like my experience at the Scottsdale location, everything is still true at the Phoenix location. D'Lisa and her staff are amazing. This particular location is close to many restaurants so if you have an appt of any kind, you can grab a bite to eat before you get your hair, nails, or waxing done. Or grab a drink after you have had your hair, nails or waxing done ( believe me if you are first timer to waxing you may need that drink but you will be sooo happy you did it). Everyone is so friendly and the salon is absolutely gorgeous. My waxing experience is getting better and better each month (meaning it is no longer as painful as it was my first time.. actually barely any pain at all)  So listen to what I am telling you, if you have not  scheduled an appointment for waxing do so STAT! While you are there you might as well get your hair and nails done so that you can really STRUT when you walk out as you will look and feel like a supermodel.  Please, please check out this location (or even the Scottsdale one) you will not regret it!

I met some of my lovely friends here for happy hour last Friday and low and behold my favorite bartender from the Merc Bar also works at this place! ( Hi Aaron) needless to say I felt extra special because he not only called me out but already knew what I wanted to drink. My friends of course were looking at me like "hmm Ebony do you ned to tell us something?" so I explained how I knew him and of course they were like aha..   The night started off slow but got increasingly busier as the night progressed . Sitting at the bar gives you a birds eye view of everything happening around and believe me there was a lot to see. My friend and I shared a lobster grilled cheese sandwich and some braised pork belly. Sweet baby Jesus both were delicious. The guy sitting next to me ordered a steak and I swear I wanted to ask him for a bite because it looked and smelled amazing. The entire staff was very attentive which was nice considering how busy this place got. All in all, a great new spot to come for happy hour however I do  I look forward to coming to try this place out for dinner sometime soon.

Great place for a Sunday All Day Happy Hour! Their drinks are on special which is exactly what we needed as we were toasting a friend of ours who had recently passed away but loved her some margaritas, chips, salsa and guac. So we honored her by having all  of her favorites. The HOT MANGO margarita which is Chili-infused Blanco, Fresh Lime, Triple Sec, Mango was absolutely delicious! Their mini pork tacos along with the endless supply of chips and salsa was equally as good. Seriously a great place to celebrate a friends life and toast to her. I will definitely be back again soon!

From the moment I walked in,  I knew I was going to have a great experience.  Even though I was dining solo everyone I encountered had a bright friendly smile. Big points right there. I decided to sit at the bar for two reasons one I was dining solo and I didn't want to take up a table and two I wanted to be nosey and watch what was going on in the open kitchen.  I was handed off to a lovely gentleman by the name of Casey who was a complete sweetheart and made my dining experience even more enjoyable.  From his smile, to his pleasant demeanor to his recommendations he definitely gets five stars all to himself.  Now for the food. My word it was delicious.  I regret my decision not to.take any pictures but I didn't want to be rude. Almost a full pound of yummy Frog legs in a sweet and spicy sauce topped in cashews on top of a  savory slaw was my first course. Now if you are saying "frog legs? EWW?" Don't knock it until you try it. They really taste like chicken,  especially if they are done right and these were done perfectly!    Next course was the Bouillabaisse.  OMG.. mussels,  scallops,  shrimp oh my. It smelled heavenly and tasted divine! Sweet baby jesus! It was in a savory tomato, fennel saffron broth that also came with a piece of toasted bread. I had to stop myself from eating all if it because it was so good and I was already full from the frog legs.   Third and final delicious course was four freshly made beignets with warm caramel sauce. OMG!  I was only able to eat one piping hot, powdered sugar coated pillow of goodness that I dipped in caramel sauce. I was stuffed and forced myself to stop eating and take the rest home. I did however wash everything down with the complimentary glass of champagne that came with my meal as it was part of the restaurant week menu.  I swear I thought Casey was going to have to roll me out of the restaurant.    Will I be back? Absolutely!  I want to try more of there menu as well as some fresh oysters.

It sucks that my previous review from 2012 is gone. Granted it was for their old location but still. The fact that I wrote a review for the new location as well and that one is also missing makes me go hmmm. Either way the food is still just as awesome as it..  Although I havent been in awhile, Jasenko, who is one of the owners remembered me! He called me out on my failure to visit lol. Oh and never, ever let anyone go ahead of you when there are only two Bureks left (or any number of Bureks for that matter) or you will be left looking longingly at the empty case once that person leaves. #truestory lol! Yay for Cervapi though. Whew! What are Bureks? They are freshly made filo stuffed yummy goodness. You can have stuffed with cheese,  beef or spinach. Once they are gone and that's it until.the next day as they are made fresh each morning.  So get there early or you will end up like me looking longingly at the empty case. Cervapi is equally delicious. To try to explain what they are would not do them justice but man they are SO GOOD!! They also have yummy desserts to choose from coke in the old fashion bottles. Score! But seriously great customer service topped off with equally delcious food = a big win in my book. I mean what more can you ask for.   Ps.. you can call ahead and preorder Bureks to ensure that you have one waiting for you when you arrive.

Chad!!! You are the bomb.com!  Thank you for making sure our mimosas were never ever empty and according to my friend Adrian you were excellent eye candy to boot. We will be back to see you. (Love Adrian). Seriously though, Chad was awesome and our crew of four couldn't thank you enough for the service. The food was also pretty good as Chad recommended that I have the skirt steak with eggs for breakfast which was delicious but the potatoes were just ok. My poor friend Adrian stated that his potatoes were cold while everything else was warm. Weird right? The eggs they ordered weren't exactly scrambled but more of a mini omelet but it was still good (according to them). But the mimosas and the service alone were enough to warrant a 4 star review in our books. We will definitely be back for brunch again soon!

It seems like it has been awhile since I have been able to get to an Elite event, so imagine how happy I was to find out I was in!! woohoo!  Like Jaime C, I really like the smaller events because you can really get a chance to talk to and meet old and new Elite members ( Leilani, Tonya, Ursula) just to name a few. I had a blast chatting it up and enjoying some of delicious new bar menu items that will soon be featured on all the Outbacks nationwide. My favorites were (in order):  Coconut Shrimp - The two I had just weren't enough lol  Margherita Flatbread - some said it tasted liked a cracker with toppings but the three or so I had ( different plates) were all yummy goodness and actually tasted like flatbread. (sorry to others, we had the good stuff ) The balsamic vinegar reduction is what made this one stand out!  Bloom petals - a new twist on a classic favorite  Bushman 'shrooms - how could you not like fried mushrooms  Short rib steakhouse nachos - as long they are hot, they are good. Once they get cold, eh not so much  Homemade bbq chips - the chips were ok but the sauce, I could have dipped anything in that Jalapeno ranch sauce and it would have tasted good. That sauce was the bees knees  Chicken Artichoke Flatbread - meh... that is all I can say about, just meh. It lacked something and I am not sure what it was  I did not partake in any liquid libations except for tons of water but my fellow yelpers seemed happy with all the delicious drink choices that were floating around.  Since all the items including the drinks will all be $4 during happy hour, you had best believe I will be visiting an Outback soon!  Thanks Lindsey and your new intern for a great time! Thank you to the Outback Steakhouse Staff on Cactus for putting up with us rowdy Yelpers!

Unfortunately I have to come here for medical reasons, but I must say that everyone has been extremely pleasant. From the front office staff to Dr. Hu, seriously, I couldn't be happier. Sadly I will have to keep coming back for awhile but hey, it could be worse?!

Wow great little spot with excellent people watching. They have a great drink happy hour with wines being either $5 off or $5 a glass  depending on the price of the wine. Their Bruschetta planks were pretty good  however the brie cheese and marmalade one, be warned that the marmalade takes over so if you like marmalade you will love it. Otherwise skip it. :( Bummer but otherwise the rest were good. All in all still a great place to come, have a few glasses of wine, some food and chat it up ( great date night as well hint hint)

What is there to say. It is a great juice bar albeit slightly expensive but worth it. I have tried three of their for Acai Bowls and my favorite is still the PB bowl. The chocolate dream smoothie is delicious (although the high in calories as is the PB Bowl) and the greenie juice is refreshing. All in all, when I am not hungry but want something, I always come here and it always satisfies whatever I may be craving (even if I am not really sure myself)

Interesting place.The bartenders really do know their stuff and make a mean cocktail of your choosing or pick one off the board/menu. Either way it is a win win. Make sure to try their popcorn which is DELICIOUS! Hell I may go back just for that reason alone. The staff are very friendly and I swear I saw the chef deliver food to a few tables. Maybe I was mistaken but still if that was the case, that is what I call SERVICE! All in all it would be a great date night place if you happen to be in the area and have you are on a date (just saying) :)

The one star that it was missing has nothing to do with Lindsey. It was actually 4.5 stars... This was in continuance of Elite Event held this past Sunday that started with a butt kicking at Orange Theory. Lindsey was kind enough to not only make sure we got our butts whipped into shape, but to take us out for a late lunch/early dinner afterwards.   The restaurant, ambiance, and staff were AWESOME!  Rob who was the manager came by and talked to us about the restaurant, the food etc as well as the head chef. I ordered one of the mix and match plates on which I had the red chili glazes sweet potato with bok choy & sesame seed, roasted brussels sprouts & wild mushroom, sauteed spinach with garlic, chili flake and lemon with salmon. Now that sounds like a ton of food right? Actually it was portioned perfectly. Just enough to have small side dishes of each with the salmon on top. The half star it is missing is that although the food was good, it was missing something that I couldn't quite put my finger on. Like it needed a little more seasoning or something, a little omph if you will. I did try my friends Sweet Corn & Quinoa with Greek yogurt and let me tell you, I was sad that I didn't have that as one of my sides because it was DELICIOUS!  I washed it down with some of the best lemonade I have had in a very long time.  The staff came around and gave us some avocado hummus to try in which we were all very happy with along with a few samples of different drinks that they had to offer.   All in all, it was a lot of fun and again the staff went ABOVE and BEYOND. They were some of the nicest people I have ever met and seemed to really enjoy working there. Will I be back? Absolutely. I am not on that side of town often but I definitely will make a point to stop by from time to time. It was well worth the drive.

This Postino's is huge!! Now granted I have not been to the Gilbert location and I hear that it is the biggest one of them all, but I can honestly say that if I lived closer to this one, I would definitely become a regular.  It was packed on a Monday night, but then again it was $20 board and wine so why would it not be? Almost every seat, inside and out (which says a lot because even the outside area is huge) was taken. Our lovely server who's name escapes was fabulous. Actually everyone was very friendly and great which is one thing I do love about all the Postino locations. I have yet to have a bad experience (knock on wood) I will definitely be back again soon.

Like a previous reviewer stated, this place was a pleasant surprise. Open entering I was greeted with the biggest and warmest smile ever and told to have a seat wherever I wanted so I opted for the cozy couch as I waited for my gorgeous friend Jody to arrive so that we could gossip about life! Our lovely waiter Michael was great and our cheese and meat board, paired with the potato chips (don't judge me)  and the bottle of Meiomi made our night of catching up even better. Next time I am here, I will have to have dinner and sit outside (once it is a little warmer of course) but I do know that I will definitely be back soon!

Eric kicked our A$$!! I am lucky I work out on a regular basis or I would have really been really hurting. I love the fact that he pushes you outside of your comfort zone and makes sure you are working to your fullest capacity. Sadly I am nursing a slight knee injury and I couldn't kick a$$ like I really wanted to but I still did pretty well. From Cardio to weight to TRX to a nice "finisher" (as we say in boot camp) I must say it was a great event! Thank you Lindsey! (but then again I enjoy working out lol) I like the fact that they give you Polar Heart rate monitors to use so that you can track your workout as well as email you with your results so you can see just how well ( or not) you did. All in all, if you are looking for a place to work out that will kick your butt, give them a try, I doubt you will be disappointed.

This place is huge. That is the good. The drinks are reasonably priced during happy hour which is another good thing (if you can ever get someone to notice you). The bartenders hmm I am not sure If I did something wrong or didn't have the right look, but I was ignored for 5 mins ( yep I am one of those that times to see how long it takes to be acknowledged) and it wasn't even a bartender (which they had a good amount of on a Friday night) that took care of me but one of their friendly waitresses who happened to notice me still standing at the bar. Sigh...  The manager on duty seem to be having a bad night as she appeared to have a scowl on her face every time someone asked her a question or as she walked around. I am going to chalk this up as to them having a bad night. The lovely waitress that took care of me and my crew ( I was the token in the group lol) was amazing and for that she alone gets 5 stars (thank you Brandi) everyone else.. eh..

This is a hidden little gem of a place in Scottsdale Quarter. I remember when my guy (#mrbermuda) was here back in March, it was not quite open yet but we made note to check it out whenever he came back into time. Fast forward to yesterday we were walking around and noticed that they were not only open for business, but had a great happy hour to boot! Score. First off, it is nice quaint little place. There is a bigger room in the back to host a small sized private party, which I may do for my birthday next year.. ok ok let me focus :) The gentleman that greeted us was a really nice guy who let us know that the happy hour was from 3-6 and all the glasses of wine were half off or you could get a bottle of wine for half off. Hmm score!! Also there were four of their bruschetta's that were on happy hour as well so you could get all four of them for $8 or double up on them or just four of the same. Whatever worked for you. Double score! So we ordered Gorgonzola, Honey, Seasonal Fruit, Goat Cheese, Olive Tapenade, Roasted Red Tomatoes, Avocado and Sun Dried Tomato Pesto, Arugula. One thing I really liked is the fact that their bread was warm. It may sound weird but it made the bruschetta taste even better not all places do that (or if they do, but the time I get it, it is cold). I am not a huge olive fan but my favorite one was the goat cheese and olive tapenade. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it was really, really good. They were not stingy with their toppings either (as some places can be from time to time) Each bite was an explosion of deliciousness in your mouth. (Party in my mouth woot woot) I hate to say it but cannot remember which wines we had last night. I know, I know fail on my part, but that just means I will have to go back. Oh another thing, they have wine dispensers in the back in which they do on the honor system. So they give you a card and you go and pick which wine you would like and it automatically dispenses it for you in the size you want 4oz, 6oz, or 8oz I believe and you pay for the wine and the size you pick. Pretty cool if I do say so myself.   So if you are wondering if I will be back? Well duh? I mean it is wine? How could I not go back? Plus it is near work so happy hour time and the service was fabulous and for only $25 three glasses of wine and a bruschetta board, you can't go wrong! :)

The morning and afternoon staff at Corner Bakery are extremely friendly and very upbeat. I had a ton of coupons I had to use before they expired so I was coming in for breakfast and lunch as the coupons made my wallet happy. Their oatmeal is hearty and their power flats are tiny ( but very good as I got to try all of them). Now their salads are good but they can be hit or miss depending on who is making them that day? I know it sounds strange but for some reason their spinach salad with chicken would be nice and hearty one day and skimpy the next time I ordered. Same for the harvest salad. It was the weirdest thing. Don't get me wrong, they were both good but I on the skimpier days I felt like I got robbed of some good eats lol.   At any rate coupon or not, the food is good, the location is great, and the staff are wonderful. I will definitely be back soon.

We escaped bank with our loot in hand!   This was a lot more fun than I expected it to to be. I was here for team building event with my job as part of our wellness day. I was on the fence about this as I do like my coworkers, but being stuck in a room with them was not my idea of fun. Well we made it fun!!! There were 8 of us in my group and we were bank robbers who had to escape the bank! Man oh man, it was intense (but in a good way) You definitely had to work together in order to solve each puzzle. I do think if you were stuck in a room with random people, you may not make it out. You only have 60 mins to get all the clues, gather the keys you need to escape the room. At any rate the bank room, like the others, was definitely a numbers game. Remember if you go, think outside the box!  We were told that only 20% actually escape each room so that makes our company overachievers as each group escaped their various rooms (#winning). It was truly a great team building experience and I am happy that I went!

I have been to this trailhead so many times. I love it! Absolutely love it! You can go for a quick trail run that is only about 4.5 miles or a few long ones that can be upwards of 13 miles are more. Either way, you will not be disappointed. Even hiking will get you a nice and leisurely workout. The views are great, especially on Sundays when you get to see tons and tons of hot hair balloons in the sky! There is plenty of parking and a restroom (although no water) so definitely come and out go for a run or a hike!

I will definitely be back here. A great place for happy hour and if you have kids or pets. The food is reasonably priced as well as the drinks, lot's of places to sit (although get here early because it gets pretty crowded quickly) just a nice place to come grab a drink with friends (or families due to the games you can play outside).

Their B.E.A.T sandwich is really good. It cost $11.91 but it is worth it.  It is Tender Bacon Belly with eggs, organic arugula and sliced tomato served with tomato -aioli on a toasted ciabatta roll and comes with hashbrowns. It is the most expensive BLT sandwich I have ever had but the flavors all mend together very well. I got mine without tomato and with my egg sunny side up as recommended. You can add Avocado if you like for an up-charge (which I did not but may next time) The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was lively and upbeat. Definitely will be visiting this place again soon.

Ever since I knew that Garrett's was opening up a spot in Vegas, I was like a kid in a candy story. So every time I come to Vegas I make a point to stop in to get my ChicagoMix fix. I arrived last Tuesday, hopped off a plane, got checked into the Mandalay Bay, then walked the 4 miles round trip to go grab me a jumbo bag of ChicagoMix so that I would have it for the 8 days I had to stay in Vegas. The day before I left, I came back to my room, grabbed my comfy shoes, and proceed on another 4 mile round trip to pick up another jumbo bag of ChicagoMix for me and a bag of CarmelCrisp for my hubby to take back with me Phoenix. Yep it is that addictive. I am happy that I don't live in Vegas as it would probably be my bi monthly stop on the strip ( Seriously) So if you have no tried some, go, NOW!  The popcorn is made fresh every day so you won't be disappointed.

I really like this place. My friend was having her Birthday happy hour here and they accommodated her quite nicely. We were able to have the outside patio, which happened to be a very nice evening for June in Phoenix. They had the misters going as well but for once, it was not really needed (although they felt quite lovely) Our lovely server, who's name escapes me, was on top of things all night. I was even able to order off the kids menu (which sometimes restaurants won't let you do) as I didn't want a huge meal nor did I want to have to take home leftovers. Two delicious sliders and fries later along with two glasses of wine, and I was one happy customer. There were two ladies in our party that both ordered the lovely ribeye steak and they both raved about it. I swear if I was hungrier I would have definitely ordered it as it looked AMAZING!   The only issue was parking. You had to be quick in order to snag a parking spot as they are few and far between. I got very lucky as someone was coming out as I was coming in, but had that not have happened, I am not sure if I would have stayed as there really was no parking spots available. All in all, I will definitely be back again in soon!
