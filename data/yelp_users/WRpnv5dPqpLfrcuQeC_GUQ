Ok so the food is good and the drinks awesome and the customer service is great, the customer service is what got me to write a review here.  I accidentally left my debit card at Fat Tuesday last Wednesday and flew out on Thursday for a trip.  They located my card on Thursday but I had already left.  Mark, one of the managers, insisted that I let him pay to overnight the card to me at my hotel, which he did.    The card was the only means of payment I had on the trip, so needless to say this was a life saver.   THAT is something you never see anymore because THAT is real customer service.  Thank you so much for being a GOOD business!

I've got a fever of 103.6 degrees.  I called Chompies at 8:50PM, ten minutes before they close.  The guy who answered told me if I got there by 9:00PM then I could buy some matzo ball soup, the age old cure for feeling like sh*t.   I say "for sure I'll be there" and hop out of bed immediately and drove over, sick as a dog, fever burning.  I arrived at 8:58PM, just to find out they had dumped out the remaining matzo ball soup and closed up.  Real cool Chompies, I've already had bad experiences with service there, now I'm definitely not coming back.

Fuck this place. No bread served before the meals and the portions are TINY! Italian, by tradition, is served in generous portions, but these meals were so small that my girlfriend, her mom, and her grandma were all left ready for another helping. And it's EXPENSIVE.  For what it is.  Would NOT come back.  I almost laughed when the waitress offered dessert because I hadn't felt like I even had dinner. Headed to Wingstop now.

Literally the only place I go anymore.  This market is saturated with crap but the guys behind CLUB Nutrition have curated a selection of high quality products who's company's are transparent with test results of their product contents for full accountability.   Previously, I'd research a dozen different proteins and the companies that manufacture them because SO many gainers and what not have exaggerated protein content, or hidden sugar alcohols which still act as carbs etc.   These guys at CLUB fully understand that and they've built a store around providing the products with the BEST ingredients available, a lot of products who's brands I had not been familiar with prior but are actually better than my old stuff.  ZEAL for example.    Highly recommend going in and talking to their staff, they are all informed about the contents of the products down to the nitty gritty details of organic vs non organic etc.  I get all my meal prep and supplements through them now.
