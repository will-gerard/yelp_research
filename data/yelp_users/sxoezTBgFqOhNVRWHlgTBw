I went to the emergency room due to extreme esophageal pain and was told that I probably had something stuck in my esophagus, but that I would need to see a specialist because there wasn't any staff on hand, to perform an endoscopy. An ENTIRE hospital and no one on hand to perform this type of procedure. When I questioned why I was told by the ER doctor Monique L Bushman, MD, that it's hard to get these types of specialists and even if they were to hospitalize me due to my pain they probably wouldn't be able to get anyone TO the hospital to check me out.  If I could give ZERO stars I would. The only reason they're getting 1 star was because of my nurse who was wonderful and how quickly I was taken back to a room.

Though the service is lacking, the brews are spot on. The Orange Blossom is a staple at this place. Crisp and refreshing any time of year. Coconut Joe is another favorite of mine. The pizzas are great too! They have an expanded menu now too, the beer bites are fantastic and again, the pizza...specifically the T-Rex.pizza. if you like meat, do it.

I've been coming here since I was a kid and it's delicious every time. My favorite entree is the garlic chicken. All appetizers are delicious especially the potstickers that are steamed then pan fried for a crunch. The staff is always courteous and prompt with food and drinks.

My first visit was pleasant. The pizza was delicious and a wonderful thin crust with a fired oven. The Mac and cheese was nothing to write home about though. I like that they also have Sobe Lean as a drink choice. The staff was friendly and it was nice to be called sir.

This place is always busy, so they must be doing something right. The protein pancakes are to die for. Service is quick and friendly. Food is always delicious too.

I've been going to Johnyee for my facials and brow waxes for almost 8 years now. She's the ONLY person I trust with my face, besides myself of course. She's friendly, personable, and treats her clients like royalty. She's also the only licensed person in Arizona to do lashes. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  When I decided to surprise my mom with a "spa day" for her 50th birthday I worked with Johnyee and the girls at the salon who were VERY accommodating and worked around the others schedule so my mom could go from one station to another seamlessly.  If you need a haircut or ANYTHING having to do with hair maintenance, see Candy or Nikki. I'm sure all of the other stylists are great, but I have visited both of these personally and can vouch for their good work.  Either of the Lisa's or Katrina for nails.  If you're looking to get pampered, Vita Bella is the place to visit and to keep visiting.

I visited this location after getting my nails done and was pleasantly surprised. The kalua pork plate was delicious and reminded me of home in Hawaii.  It could have had more salt, but all around it was very tasty.  The macaroni salad was as it should be and the rice was perfect with the Aloha Shoyu provided!  The manapuas were smaller than I'm used to, but still tasty and the spam musubi was delicious as well.  I think this place is wonderful!

The idea behind this place is great. It screams nostalgia for any gamer while providing really good pizza. The pepperoni pizza was delicious. The crust was cooked to perfection and the cheese was gooey and melted. They carry a variety of canned sodas, my personal favorites including Grape soda and Vanilla Dr. Pepper! Being able to play video games while you wait for your order is what makes this place so unique. Each table against the wall has at least one system hooked up varying from NES to the Wii U and PS3! Overall great place. 4 stars instead of 5 because of location size. It could be so much more if moved to a larger location. But, start small and grow Super Pizza Bros.

I've been going to Johnyee for 7 or 8 years now and wouldn't trust anyone else with my face. I started with just eyebrow waxing to tame my unibrow, but then graduated to facials; I can't go without them now. My skin looks and feels so much better when she's done with it. She's gentle during the extraction process, which is good because it is slightly painful at times.  I honestly wouldn't consider going to anyone else for a facial or a wax. She's as good as they come AND competitively priced for all the services you receive.
