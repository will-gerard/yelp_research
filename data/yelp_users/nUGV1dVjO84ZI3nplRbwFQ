I cook and I love tools. This is the place for me. I don't need anything flashy or something with a fancy ebony wood handle. I just need professional level cooking supplies, without all the glitz of comparable consumer-oriented products. This place has exactly that.  As the name implies, they are more geared towards restaurants instead of the average single-person consumer. Their prices are a bit cheaper than what you'd find at Bed Bath & Beyond and its ilk. Not everything is less expensive, so it still pays to be an educated buyer and do some comparison shopping beforehand.

I did not expect such a great find in a such a nondescript location. I went there looking for a very odd beer. Not only did they have it, they had tons of it. The guy behind the counter was helpful as soon as I walked in, and showed me exactly what I needed.  They know what they sell very well, and can give excellent recommendations on whatever you might be looking for. It was great to talk shop with someone who obviously knew his stuff.

This place is a great surprise. It's located in a strip mall, but don't let the surroundings throw you off. It was one of my absolute favorite casual, French dinners ever.  From what I understand, they only recently introduced the dinner menu. Even so, there were no signs of growing pains--as if they'd been doing it for years. The food was very well presented. I had the foie gras salad to start. It was simply prepared with a tiny baton (fresh out of the oven!), mixed greens, balsamic vinaigrette, and a generous, thick portion of fois gras. Outstanding.  I had the coq au vin afterward. It was a more modern take on the classic French comfort food, with some of the traditional elements separated out. Again, presented very well. The chicken breast was topped with mashed potatoes. The braising sauce was perfectly seasoned. It came with a carrot puree, bacon (lardon perhaps? I can't remember), and sauteed mushrooms, all on the side... I had to remind myself that I was an adult in a public place to keep myself from licking the plate.  All the while, we were well attended by the wait staff. During the meal, Duc, the owner/chef, came to check on us and make sure everything was up to par. As great as the food is, meeting Duc was my favorite part of the evening. The man was very enthused to talk about the meal and the restaurant, despite being at the end of a long day. His passion for food shows in his words and in his cooking.  I ended with a profiterole, to-go. While going through the pastry case, Duc even gave me some great insight on the methods and history of choux pastry dough. I've been struggling with making it at home, and I can't wait to try his recommendations.

I hesitate to be critical of a place when it's only just opened. But I do this because I hope some of the problems can be fixed.  I'll start with the positive. The vibe of the place was great. I'm a huge fan of the building. The aesthetics of it are awesome. It feels small and intimate, but looking around, it can obviously accommodate a lot of people. From what I've seen, it's more geared towards large groups of people, with many large booths with room for 8.  There are a few problems that I'm sure every restaurant has when just starting out. The food took a very long while to come out. Which doesn't make sense, because not many people were ordering food. The most disappointing part was that the menu was limited to about 4 items. I went there on the third day they were open though, so all of this is completely forgivable.  There are a few things that I would expect to be more difficult to fix. Parking was a huge PITA. We parked about a half mile away, but I guess that's to be expected in Old Town. The location is right across from a biker bar. With a bunch of people coming and going from there with open pipes, it was difficult to have a conversation indoors next to a closed window. I imagine it was much worse for everyone on the patio. Above all, I don't think the quality of the food justified the price. I had the blue cheese burger, for $13. It was cooked to order nicely (med-rare), but had little flavor other then the toppings. The meat itself wasn't spectacular, which is what I would expect at that price. And the parmesan fries that came with were bland and came in a small portion.  There's a good amount of buzz about this place, and I think it shows promise. I definitely want to come back once they've settled in and give things another try.
