I shop here because, it is the only place to get what I need in biking distance.  9 out of 10 times,  I am overcharged.  On my last 2 visits it was for over $4.  I make it a habit to go over my receipt, near customer service to collect my inevitable refund.

I went there on Mother's Day and the family style food was awful. Canned beans, dry bland chicken topped with gluey gravy and cinnamon flavored stuffing underneath. Beef ribs thickly coated in sickly sweet bbq sauce. Low quality pressed ham with a canned pineapple glaze. Dry bland potato wedges. I felt really bad for suggesting we go there. I had been looking forward to a nice meal but blew it with this place.

This review is long overdue.  I ordered a cake for my boyfriends birthday.  It was very pricey $45 for a relatively small cake but I figured it was worth it (for the size)  for a high quality cake.  However it was not.  Though the appearance of the cake was good, the cake itself was very dry and with the fondant icing gross.  I've tried a  few other things there  the coconut cupcake, eh bought 2 ended up throwing one away again very dry and not fresh tasting.    For a 'cake' shop somebody needs to learn how to make them properly.  Though I will say the red velvet brownie is very good as well as the brioche.

Five stars for the prime rib!  The best I have ever eaten.

Poor service. I had a bad experience there today. I walked to the counter and ordered a ham, egg and cheese sandwich. The cashier Bobby said something I could not make out. I repeated "ham, egg and cheese sandwich." "The power sandwich?" he asks. I look up at the menu and say "I don't know I would like the sandwich that says "ham, egg and cheese." I glance at the menu again and notice that the heading of some sandwiches says "power sandwiches" in a smaller font. The thing is they only serve one ham, egg and cheese sandwich, so why the need for clarification? Bobby gives me a number and I find a table and wait. I wait for nearly 20 minutes. This is no exaggeration, as I had the time ordered, on my receipt.  I hear a lady with a thick accent calling out a few times. I believed she was calling my number. I went to the front put down my number, took the bag left on the counter and went back to my table. I start eating and its not my sandwich. I go back to the counter and apparently I had taken someone else's sandwich. The manager just looked at me and shook her head. They made the waiting man's sandwich and then made mine. Where was my sandwich to begin with? Do the breakfast sandwiches usually take 20 minutes to make, maybe that was my mistake and I didn't wait long enough. The whole experience was frustrating to say the least.

Went in for the first and last time on Saturday night.   The chicken was burnt with pools of grease on top.  It seemed as though they had already cooked chicken and redipped in the fryer to warm.  The sweet tea was stomach churningly sweet.  The service was inattentive.  At the end of our meal a man took our card went outside and chatted with another table, we were in a hurry and had to ask another person to go find out what was going on.  The place was clean and the workers were friendly, but what I really want  from a restaurant is good food, and this place lacks.

I heart happy hour @ brick!   $3 four peak brews (and they even have peach, my favorite) and a selection of half price delicious happy hour food  Everyday till 6:30 p.m.  perfecto.  The music is great, location is nice.  Service is awesome!  I can ride my bike there and park it just outside the patio.  My new favorite spot.

I've been there three times now and it is awesome.   Definitely the best place on Mill Ave.  for casual atmosphere, good food and drinks.   I've eaten there two of those times.  Had the swiss and mushroom burger with onion rings ($1.49 additional) very juicy burger with a buttery toasted bun. The other time I had the overstuffed sandwich with corned beef.  The sandwich was huge, stuffed with fries and coleslaw and served with potato chips.  I split it with my boyfriend and we were both satisfied.  Luckily it was a Thursday and we were able to catch the $1 budlight draft special that runs from 3-7. Woo Hooo can't beat that.  Last Sunday we hit up "SIN Sunday"  for their open mic night,  good vibe lots of peeps performing, so much fun.  I didn't intend on staying too long but didn't leave until closing time.  Really good drink specials if you perform or are in the service industry.  $2 you call it, beer and good liquor like captain or cuervo.  Love, love this spot!  p.s. Incredibly delightful staff

well.....went to see Bob Saget, the show was great.  There were a couple of things that kinda irked me.  The  waitress never brought out the cheesecake I ordered.  It wasn't on the bill either so I'm assuming she just forgot.   Also when using the restroom, soap was not available in ANY of the dispensers just a weird lady standing there with a pump expecting to be paid $1 to squirt some in your hand.  I hate bathroom attendants they are so weird.  It reminds me of being bombarded by a homeless person to wash your windshield.  The opposite of classy.  Ended up going to copper blues the following week after seeing a sign for karaoke.  Call ahead to make sure they say yes it's happening, get there and they say no not happening, very disappointing, that's why we called.

I am a foodie that loves to cook. I like to eat food that takes effort. Food that takes hours to prepare. This is what makes paying premium prices at a restaurant worth it to me. This restaurant is totally worth it!       My husband and I started with the corn cake souffl√©, it was amazing. It is light fluffy, sweet and spicy. We then shared the Crepas De Mariscos and Puerco en Chipolte. I wasn't sure what to expect from the Crepas but when they arrived I was pleased to see two large "burrito" sized crepes on the plate topped with a green sauce. They were generously filled with fresh fish, shrimp and crab. They were so good I let out an audible sigh when I tasted them. The  Puerco is basically carnitas in a really good chipotle sauce topped with cheese. The pork is so tender and has a slow roasted smokey flavor. It was so good. The food was top quality.      Our server was friendly and attentive during the meal. I am really looking forward to trying more dishes.

This is my new go to Pho restaurant. The food is great I usually get the Pho w/ meatballs and rare steak and the crispy egg rolls. I love karaoke so I usually come when they have it on Thursday nights. The kj Phil is really good. The bartender Shaun and owner Victor are really fun too. I went last night and about to go again tonight :) it really has a nice neighborhood bar feel.
