We came here tonight looking to enjoy some decent Mexican food. Unfortunately, the food and service were less than decent. My boyfriend and I were extremely impressed with how terrible it was. First, our server got an attitude when HE brought me the wrong beer, despite my unnecessary apologies. Second, my boyfriend ordered a carnitas burrito which was small, came with nothing but tortilla and meat, and the tortilla wasn't even cooked. For $9.25. Talk about over priced. I would think a near $10 burrito would at LEAST come with rice and beans but that's a $3 up charge. For rice and beans......seriously? My chicken tacos tasted like they came straight out of a can. Four tacos for $10.95. I would happily pay that much for four tacos if the meat was half decent and the toppings were fresh. Needless to say, not the best customer service, outrageously overpriced, and poor quality of food. We won't be returning.

I LOVE PITA JUNGLE. There were a couple of girls there super concerned with their hair and constantly playing with it which was kind of gross, but the girl who helped me, Amanda, basically handled everything. She was answering phones, tending the bar, doing to go orders, getting drinks, greeting AND seating all with a smile on her face. Great service and always great food! Thanks, Amanda! 10/10 for sure

Soooo my boyfriend, who is Filipino and Mexican and loves Filipino food, and I have been waiting for months for this place to open as it is right by our house! We are in love. We got the bihon pancit, the lechon kawali, and the Bicol express and loved all of it!!! Real authentic Filipino food and the owners were very helpful and kind. We got the halo halo for dessert, delicious!!!

This place is pretty good! I got the nan pizza which was delicious, a small side caprese salad which was only $2.99 (not bad for all the mozzarella and tomatoes that came with it) and the IPA they have on tap. They have a small draft selection but great beers! I guess quality over quantity. The pizza was smaller than I expected but perfect for one person, Or two if you get salads as well. Overall the place is very clean and well put together. They're brand new so give them some time to work out all the kinks! They don't offer wifi YET but until they do you can connect to the wifi from the Starbucks next door. I'll totally be coming back. #supportlocalbusinesses #golocal
