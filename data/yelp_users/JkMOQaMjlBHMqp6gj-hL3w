Decided to visit this place because a friend of mine just started working here, Kristin, she alone is worth a visit to this place. Kristin has such an upbeat personality and a beautiful smile, make sure you ask her when you go and tell her Amber sent ya !!  The restaurant has a huge patio facing Central Ave and the inside is decorated very tastefully. They have a nice selection of wines, specialty cocktails, and beer ( mostly Asian imports ).   My husband and I ordered :  The Temple of the Thaiger- delicious and described as a party in your mouth, and it was. Perfectly seasoned chicken layered on fried won tons.  Satay Sampler- This was shrimp, chicken, and beef covered in a peanut sauce and was very yummy.  Freshie Rolls- we had the chicken and the veggie and both were soooooo good, this is a must try !  Jasmine rice- steamed to perfection.  All food is made to order and is fresh and delicious. This is a family owned and operated business with Thai born chefs that really know what they're doing. It is a little pricey for Thai food, but the quality and flavor make it worth it. They also have several lunch specials for $7.95 from 11-2 Monday thru Friday.

I have been here 3 times now and just love it. The place is delicious, clean, and cheap. Their specialty is the chicken terryaki. I recommend getting the all white meat version ( just a bit extra ). I have had the beef bowl & the chicken bowl, these are very generous portions and have yet to be able to eat it all in one sitting.  Service is super friendly and helpful. I will be back to this place soon !

Came by here for the first time on a Friday night to drink some wine and listen to some live music. I fell in love with the place right away, it is just perfect, nice and cozy, but not cramped. We drank a couple of bottles of wine and enjoyed being right in front for some great music.   We had already eaten not much earlier so I decided to get an appetizer to give their food a try. I was craving some hummus, but a few moments later I was advised they were out and the server suggested trying the baba ganoush. This was actually my first time trying this dish, ever, and it was superb !! I have also heard great things about their peppered turkey sandwich from a fellow patron, so I will try next time.  Also...while enjoying my Friday night, it got even better when the owner/manager came over and thanked us for coming in and gave us 2 complimentary meals!!! So, I will be back for sure to try some more food, you should really check this place out.

Came back here on a Wednesday afternoon to redeem my complimentary meals with my daughter. When we arrived there was only one table occupied, yet it took about 10 minutes before someone came to our table, as we were waiting I noticed a fly flying around inside the sugar dispenser..yuck!!!   The server/bartender was very friendly throughout our stay, but as the only one working as tables started to fill up, service lagged a bit.   I ordered the turkey/raspberry sandwich served with fresh mozzarella, lettuce, cucumber, raspberry jam, and mayo. This is a cold sandwich but the turkey was like room temperature and not very enjoyable. Also, the croissant was very flimsy and did not hold up very well to the ingredients. I  opted for the soup which was Mediterranean Chicken...waaaay too much pepper and not enough salt or chicken.   My daughter had a similar sandwich (minus the jam) and chips. She said the sandwich was average, but the small broken chips that were on the plate looked like they came from the bottom of the bag...no bueno.  Another issue that I had was that the server/bartender went outside at one point, not sure what he did, but he DID NOT wash his hands when he returned and started making drinks & serving food. A few minutes later when he came to our table he reeked of cigarette smoke....this is not acceptable in any way.   Despite the issues that I had on this visit I do still like the place for drinks and music...also the employees have been very friendly. I would return for these reasons and I hope that they make some improvements on the areas that I mentioned.

This was  my first time here, and since it was downtown and lunch time, I decided to call to see if they validate for any  of the nearby parking garages if you eat there. Called up, a man answered, told him exactly what I said above, and was told  " yeah, there sure is, the Chase garage." So I park there, and upon asking for validation I am told they do not do that. I let the woman know that I called and was told otherwise. She then rudely tells me she is the owner and only her and one other person answer the phones. I tell her I talked to a man, she then hollers to the back asking someone if they validate, and the man says nope. She  then tells me I must have misunderstood.   I did not misunderstand, the person who answered the phone must not have been listening to my question....so on top of my overpriced and mediocre sandwich, I had to pay to park. People here were rude, and I felt like I was being rushed the whole time even when it was not busy.  The only positive thing I can say is that the place was very clean, if you do try this place I hope it's better than my experience.

I only come here to get their 99 cent bags of ice that are advertised all over their outside windows.   Unfortunately, out of 6 visits they have only had the bagged ice once. Why??? And offering me a large cup of ice for the same price is not gonna make me happy Mr. Manager. Just bag that ice up....

I went here with my husband and his cousin. This was my first time here and was assured by the cousin that it was yummy.  The husband and I got the catfish, BBQ beef sandwich, fries, beans and a drink. I have to say that I was very happy with what we ordered and would order it again and again and again. The catfish was perfectly seasoned and fired to a delicious crisp. The beef was a little fatty than I would like, but the meat and the sauce was so yummy that it didn't matter much. The beans were delicious was seasoned with lots of brown sugar and pieces of pulled pork. What can I say...I was very happy after this meal and will be back to try the pork and chicken.  The service was very quick and the food was very hot and everyone was very friendly.

Hello Ranch Market, nice to finally meet you ! Since moving to my new hood I have fallen in love with this store. They have things I have never seen before anywhere else. I am so overwhelmed when I go here, I am in sensory overload.  Mexican bread is 5 for $2, bolillos are 6 for $1, tons of seafood, fresh chorizo ( which I have been eating everyday for a week ), tons of snacks packaged by Ranch Market for super cheap, you can get a meal for 4 people for $10 ( carnitas, rice, beans, tortillas ) and tons of other specialty items. The atmosphere is fun and inviting and everyone is friendly. This store has inspired me to create new dishes at home, like my homemade beans and chorizo.   Go here, eat some of their prepared foods that are inexpensive and delicious OR get some fresh ingredients and make something yummy at home.  See ya soon Ranch Market.

Pretty clean as far as Ross stores go, and no waiting in line!!! There were not many people here at all...only reason I didn't dish out the five stars is because the cashier had MAJOR attitude, she needs an adjustment pronto.

Had a massive craving for catfish on a Sunday afternoon and wanted some cheap take out. Came across this place that is not too far from my hood and decided to give it a try.   I ordered the 3 piece catfish and chips and a side of clam strips. My catfish was amazing!! The fries, the poor fries, they were the only reason this wasn't a 5 star review. They were soggy and tasteless, but the fish and clams made up for it. This place is cheap and delicious and I will be back again soon.   Also tried the whitefish on their menu and it was really tasty as well.  Catfish is served ALL week long, yay!!

This is actually the first time I have ever been to a Waffle House. My husband's cousin talks about going here all the time, so I had to check it out.  Our server was friendly and she even was able to incorporate the phrase " sausage fest " into our brief conversations. In other instances this would have annoyed me because of how inappropriate it was in this setting, but while staring at her huge pregnant belly, I could do nothing but laugh.  The food was not good. The sausage gravy was way too salty, eggs were way under-cooked, waffles were average, coffee was alright ( served in a lipstick stained mug the first go around ), sausage and bacon were below average, hash browns were limp, mushy, and flavorless.  I would only return to a Waffle House if this was my ONLY option.

This place is cheaper than other theaters, and that is the only positive thing. Every time I have been here there is an issue with the sound. The sound is either very very low or not present at all during the previews. This really irks the crap out of me. I really like to see what new movies are coming out. Every time I have complained I am told that the sound will be fine once the movie starts, not OK, and because of it I would rather spend a little more somewhere else!!

This is our favorite place to go hang out for some drinks. We always sit in the bar area because we love the bartenders here. They make the best drinks and are such friendly folks.  Some of the food is good too...but we mostly come for the drinks. Highly recommend their signature drink...The Presidente Margarita...yummy!! They also have some happy hour specials and some other great drinks as well.  Go check this place out!!

This is still my favorite local place to go have drinks and they still have the same great bartenders after all these years..two of my favorites are Bomber and Toby. The food is always decent, but I have in recent months been trying to eat more healthy and decided to get their Margarita Chicken. It was soooo delicious!!! The chicken was marinated in citrus juices and spices, then grilled, put on a bed of rice and black beans, and topped with pico de gallo. Highly recommended this dish regardless if you are on a diet or not. They also have very friendly servers here and a great management team!!   You can also order online or by phone for pick-up or you can get delivery from You Buy and We Fly

I ordered the queso with chips on 09/13/15 at about 6:30pm. I found a french fry in the queso after eating about 5 bites. The server was apologetic and brought another one, and after 2 bites, AGAIN found a fry. Both times our server told the manager (Stan) about it because we could see them, and no one ever came to talk to us or offer any compensation for the situation. I was obviously turned off from the queso and ordered the fried cheddar bites but was charged for them :-(. My family and I have been coming to this location for about 12 years at least once a week and I am not happy about how management said nothing and did nothing about it.

I came here on Valentine's Day to try their happy hour for the first time (All Day Sundays). Our bartender Misty was great and she was the best thing about our dining experience.   We ordered the steak quesadilla and it was terrible. It was really greasy, it seems like they used cheap oily cheese and a very thin flour tortilla causing all the oils from the cheese and meat to seep through. Had to use a fork to eat it, after two bites I could not eat any more of it, just too much grease. Also we were given brown guacamole and damp transparent lettuce ($6 HH). The jumbp shrimp cocktail ($6 HH) was 6 small rubbery shrimps that did not look appetizing at all. My man ate them cause he didn't want to complain on such a busy night.   Misty did a great job with our drinks and have no complaints there, they do have some great deals on drinks for HH. We did not complain that night because of how busy they were, but the manager is the one that delivered both of our dishes and he should have seen at least how bad that quesadilla dish looked. And he never came by to ask how things were.

i took my son here after he pleaded that after seeing the commercials about the new stuff on the menu...we had to give them another try. On previous visits the service was so bad we never wanted to come back. On this visit the service was much better and the food was typical, nothing to make me want to return. The biggest issue though was how dirty the place was. The menus we were served were filthy and the hostess kept wiping down tables with a rag she kept at the front. The rag was not rinsed out between tables and I thought it was pretty gross. Our plates were dirty on the bottom and the glasses looked dingy.

I have been here about 5 times in the last couple of years and have always had great food and great service.   They have a great price on their house wine and they serve in big glass, which is the way I like it!! The sangria that they have here is absolutely yummy..not a whole lotta alcohol in it...but it is pretty and delicious.  They have great appetizers like the calamari, the bruschetta, and of course the bread they serve with the olive oil is just what I need to clean out my arteries. It is so addicting.   We usually get whatever special pasta dish they are running and have never been disppointed.

I have been here about 3 times, twice  for the weekend breakfast buffet and once for lunch. The food is similar to Denny's, so nothing special here. Everything here feels dingy and dirty, there was hair in one of the dishes in the buffet. Service is average, but employees are just as dirty looking as the restaurant..will not be coming here anymore.

Went in here for lunch on a Friday afternoon, ordered my food, sat down and started sweating because it was so hot. By the time my food was done myself and another customer were at the front counter to ask about why it was so hot. The other customer was a grandmother there with her grandson and both were drenched in sweat. The employee told us that the corporate office sets the thermostat and there was nothing she could do. I asked to speak to a manager and was told there was not one on duty. I asked if she could call someone about the situation and she said no, it wont do any good anyway, they will not adjust the thermostat. I canceled my order and went to the McDonald's in Buckeye, which was nice and cool. This is Arizona guys, turn that AC up!!

The kids like the clothes here and sometimes they have good prices on their clearance items (found at every endcap).   I have to agree with the other review about the upkeep of the store and the employees. No one has ever been friendly...ever. The store is usually a mess...and thats what you get when people get paid shit...they dont do shit. Oh well...what can you do.

I went here recently with my family for some breakfast and was very pleased with the food and the service.  We had the eggs benedict, biscuits and gravy, and my husband had their version of eggs benedict which had roasted turkey and avocado. We also all shared one of their cinnamon rolls. The cinnamon was my favorite thing here and I would go back just for this. It may have not looked appealing when it arrived, but each bite melted in my mouth. It was not heavy like a most cinnamon rolls....it was light and delicious and the perfect size for 2 people to share.  Both benedicts were delicious...I substituted bacon on my benedict and the loaded plenty on my plate. The husbands benedict contained delicious fresh turkey that tasted like it was carved off the bird. My son had the biscuits and gravy which he liked very much and was served a huge portion for just $3.95 ! Also my husband said their coffee was the best he had in a long time and they left the container of coffee so he could refill many times.   Our waitress was very sweet and checked back with us regularly to see if we needed anything. I will definitely go back for breakfast here and try some other menu items. We spent about $30 for all 3 of us and we left plenty full and content.

I have been back here twice since my last visit and this place has really declined in food quality and service.   The delicious cinnamon roll that I had on  my first visit has since become cold and dry. The eggs benedict was covered in a flavorless and odd colored hollandaise sauce. Bacon was limp and lifeless and so were the employees.  I have to say that I have no plans on returning here until they get their act together.

Not one complaint here, this burger place is right on time. Got " The  Big One" with American cheese and fries for $5.49. The place was packed when I was there during lunch time, we waited about 10-15 minutes to get our food, and I was VERY pleased with every bite.   They have a condiment bar to add your own toppings, all I added was a little mayo, ketchup, and mustard.....that burger was a flame broiled disc of greatness! Fries were perfectly crunchy and tasted extra special dipped in ranch.   The place has great atmosphere and a cute patio area to sit outside when it's a nice day, service was prompt and courteous....can't wait to go back here.

Never again !  The fish here is as cheap as you can get, pre-fabricated fish squares that are slightly better than McDonald's filet-o-fish. The shrimp that I ordered were flat, like pounded out flat, who knows what this crap was. The fries  were limp and flavorless. The only thing that made this any better was the "special sauce", which I believe to be hot sauce & ketchup.  This place is SUPER cheap and the food reflects why. There is no reason I will ever eat here again, peace out Pete's !

I am totally in love with their fresh brewed mango iced tea, it is really good. Their food is more on the healthy side and offers some choices that are not on most breakfast/lunch spots.   I have tried their eggs benedict with turkey & avocado and it was wonderful. The turkey here tastes fresh roasted and is sliced super thin. Also had their waffle...wow!! its light, fluffy, and not too sweet. Comes with hot syrup and a fruit compote.  Service here is excellent all around, even when they are super busy. I will be back here again and again.

Stay as far away from this place as possible. I went here against my will, I am surprised that I am still alive. Family members suggested eating here  after going to the mall. Big HUGE mistake. I am not sure what was worse...the food or the employees. Both looked grossed as hell. I stuck to foods that temperature was not an issue...like pizza and bread. This place was filthy...everywhere, and the food was nasty looking.

Stopped here on a Saturday evening just to sit on the patio and people watch. They have a happy hour from 9pm to close that consists of half price wines,draft,and well drinks and appetizers for $1.99 and $2.99.   We had the mozzerella sticks (had better from sonic), buffalo wings (very average) and a mini deep dish pizza ( yuck !!) The pizza was charred around the edges and this made it impossible to bite into...so the pizza consisted of about 4 edible bites which were not that tasty.  The service was great and we had fun with the free entertainment from the passers by...i would go back for DRINKS ONLY during happy hour, but that is it.

I took my daughter here for a girls day on Sunday. The place is so cute inside, not at all what I expected from the outside. It is drenched in country decor, but in a good way. I love how stuff did not match perfectly, like the chairs and the plates.  They were actually closed when we arrived at 1:06 pm, but they gladly encouraged us to come in. The Hostess was a young lady that had a down to earth friendly personality and even complimented my daughter on her necklace. Our server was just as lovely and was very attentive the entire time.  I ordered the eggs benedict ($7.50) and my daughter ordered a turkey sandwich on sourdough ($4.50). They delivered the delicious muffins that were mentioned in the previous post...we had banana nut and zucchini muffins and they were sooooo yummy.  The food came out in no time at all and was very very pleased with the benedict and the potatoes that came with. The eggs were perfectly poached and hollandaise sauce was delish.The potatoes were just like I make at home, perfectly seasoned with  little crispy pieces here and there. I was impressed because I have paid a lot more for this elsewhere and did taste nearly as good. The daughter's turkey sandwich was stacked high with thinly sliced turkey and cheese and she was also very satisfied.   I will definetly return here and would recommend trying it if you are in the area. The service and the food were both great and that is no easy task.

My husband used to go here for the Menudo on Sunday, he says it was as close to his Grandma's that he has had yet.  We no longer go here because of the health ratings that this place has had. They were almost shut down because it was so bad. Apparently the kitchen is very dirty and in need of a lot of repair.

I went here on a Saturday afternoon to get a waffle cone and some ice cream. Order some vanilla with some chocolate chips mixed in with a waffle cone. The guy starts putting it in a waffle bowl...I'm like hey...I wanted a waffle cone. He says ..well we dont have any. What? Why? Can you make some? I will wait. No he says ...the bowl is the same price. Fine !! The bowl was stale and I was pissed....shame on you Cold Stone !!!

Came here during restaurant week and was a happy girl from start to finish. At first I was a little disappointed that there was no steak on the restaurant week menu, but that soon passed. Our server was on point for our entire visit, drinks were always full, and he had a sense of humor.   First of all, that garlic bread they give you is super special, very original. Topped with leeks, garlic, herbs, marinated  in olive oil, it was  gone quick. I had the baked brie with a raspberry reduction w/ toast.....this was sooooo divine, it could have been a dessert. I could eat this everyday and love it each time. My entree was the citrus glazed salmon, it was cooked perfectly and the sauce complimented the fish. The husband had the pork chop w/ au gratin potatoes...that pork was slammin'!!! Wow, it was thick, juicy, and ooh so good. The potatoes were yummy as well. For dessert we had the creme brulee and the chocolate cake. The cake was my favorite, chocolate & raspberry goodness served with fresh whipped cream.  We paid $40 per person and this included the 3 courses, glass of wine, and any other non-alcoholic beverage ( soda, tea, coffee ).   This place is not cheap, but the food & service is worth it, we will be back.

I just wanted to add my personal wonderful food and drink experience.  I went for Brunch on Saturday with my husband and we are now fans of this place. There was nothing at all to say bad about FEZ.  I had the eggs benedict and a Bellini and was in heaven with every bite and every sip!! The husband had the breakfast kisra and was moaning with happiness after every bite...I tasted it too and will try this for my next brunch visit. My husband had a Bellini as well and also had a honeydew melon margarita and both were divine!!  Our server  was super cute and very sweet during our visit..he also was helpful with suggestions on what to order and also enlightened up on the happy hour specials.  I will be back very soon and you have not tried FEZ you are missing out on a great experience.

I had high hopes for this place after seeing it on the food network and hearing good reviews from coworkers.  What we ate: 1. machaca burrito-according to my son this was one of the best burritos he has had in a while..it was $3.50 and he ate it in like 4 bites..a bit small.  2. Jade red pork quesadilla, jerk chicken, white rice- the rice was fine, the quesadilla only had a few pieces of pork and the chunks were huge and very very dry and tough. That jerk chicken was the most awful thing I have ever tasted !!!! that was not jerk chicken...it was soaked, dredged in nothing but black pepper, I almost choked. Jerk should be spicy and I am a fan of the spice, this was not edible in any way.  3. carnitas burrito, jade red chicken, jerk fried rice-the chicken was average, tasted like sweet and sour chicken, the jerk fried rice was almost as overpowering as the chicken, but edible. the carnitas was like no other we have ever seen...shredded beyond belief and a weird spinach flavor to it. we asked if spinach was in it and was told it was cilantro. The cilantro may have taken on a bitter flavor from being cooked for so long...whatever the case ...the flavor was just odd and had a horrible after taste for hours.  The staff were very nice and accomadating.  i dont think i will venture here again...ever.

All was delish here !!!  Had the 3 meat platter with 2 sides and cornbread that I shared with the husband: we got the brisket, baby back ribs, and pulled pork. All the meat was moist and delicious and tasted great even without the BBQ sauce. We mac-n-cheese and grilled veggies for the sides...and both were yummy. My favorite was the cornbread...it was the best I have had and i would go just for that . They also give you these little fried donuts with cinnmaon and sugar for free before you leave and they were super sweet and yummy!!   Did not know about the 10% off when I went...ooh well maybe next time.  Service was great too!!

I was craving some mexican food last Saturday and remembered seeing the reviews on this place and wanted to check it out and I am very glad that I did.  This place was delicious and authentic and the absolute best part is that the have 99 cent margaritas on Saturday and Tuesday ALL DAY !!!!!  I was in heaven. This is just the house margarita...but hell...for that price you can not go wrong.  We had the mini platter that came with tacos, flautas, chimichangas, a big tamale, tostada, and rice and beans. It was all delicious ( wehad our with the machaca). We also ordered a bowl of the Albondigas soup and it was sooo yummy !! Chips and salsa were great too !! We had the fried ice cream for dessert...nothing spectacular...just fried ice cream...but good anyway.  The service here was friendly, fast, and very attentive. I will definetly bo back here and would recommend it to you all !!!

Went here with husband for some drinks at happy hour. We asked about the specials and were told about the specials on beers and martinis. I am not sure what the happy hour prices were but lets just say that the martinis were $5, according to our waitress. I asked what kind of martinis they had and decided on the lemon something or other. My husband ordered the house brew that was recommended by the server.  When the drinks came mine was very yummy. The husband took a nice big drink and thought it was yummy too ( not his words, though). After he put the glass down after taking a drink I noticed that there was some things floating in the glass. We were not sure what it was...it looked like just a bunch of debris floating around. He almost lost it. We showed the server and she was very sorry and returned with a new one. I ordered 2 martinis and he finished his beer and did not feel like having another so we asked for the bill. When I looked on the bill I noticed that the drinks were not the prices that she had stated when we came in and aasked about the specials. The beers was $2 more than she quoted...and my martinis were not $5...they were $9.50. Just at that moment the manger came by and asked how we were doing, I asked about the bill and was told that the happy hour price was for a smaller glass than what my husband had and that only the house martinis were $5 and mine were not house martinis.   When the husband ordered the beer he asked what is the happy hour special...what do you recommend...and that is what she brought. Same thing about the martinis. I felt schwindled. He adjusted it. Thanks .  We did not order any food, but the menu was very pricey. That better be some good eats!!!

I had the meat and cheese pasty with the red wine gravy..all I can say is that my mouth was soooo happy the entire time I was eating it! I did not eat in the restaurant, my husband ate there and brought me home the pasty. You have to put it in the oven for about 15-25 minutes, and the crust continues to cook though and becomes buttery, flakey, and delicious. The red wine gravy was very flavorful and added extra goodness to the sausage and cheese that was inside. I can not wait to try some other fillings on my next visit.  Also, the husband said that even though they were packed at lunch, they still received excellent service in the restaurant. They bake each pasty when ordered, so it does a little while to get your order...at least 25-35 minutes.

Great place to chill and have some beer/wine, the selection of beers is extensive. They have live music usually on the weekends with some awesome local talent. If you are in the neighborhood it is definitely worth checking out.

I came here with my daughter per her advisement that I would fall in love with the burgers here. We came on a Thursday during lunch time and the place was packed!! We both ordered a double cheeseburger and then made one a combo meal, we shared the fries and drink. By the time we found a seat at the counter our food was ready ( about 5 minutes ) I was impressed that they got it done so fast. When I took the first bite and the cheese and the juice from the burger patties started to run down my face and hands I knew I was in love. The burger was juicy and flavorful and the fries were very hot and crispy. I was barely able to finish the burger, but it was soooo good I had to eat it all.  We watched them make the burgers while we sat at the counter and were to see other types of burgers to give ideas of what to get next time. Our bill came to only $11.07 and we were both stuffed for the rest of the day. I will definitely be back again and again.

I actually never was able to try the food here. I got so pissed at the girl taking my order that I left. What happened? Well listen to this...I decided on a sandwich..I am not sure of the name , but it had roast beef and some sort of yummy cheese and the other sandwich stuff they add to it. Well I am not a fan of veggies, i know, that's so childish, but it is what it is. Anyway, I tell the girl what I want and I let her know I want the roast beef sandwich with only cheese and mayo, no veggies. She then looks very puzzled..." you just want cheese and mayo on bread"? I said no....I want the roast beef with just cheese and mayo. She then says that it does not make any sense...."so you don't want the meat"? I then ask her...why would I order "roast beef" and then not want the meat? She is like well I dont know you are the one that ordered it that way. Im like are you serious right now???? She then says ...well if you are not gonna order can you step aside so I can take the next order. What ????!!!!! I ask to speak to the manager...who apparently is the girl that has been standing next to her the whole time and did not seem to think there was a problem at all.   I was so outta there...I am sure the food is yummy..but it is such a shame to not only have an employee that responds this way...but to have a person in charge thinking it was normal.

I have been going to various Red Robin restaurants  since about 1990 and have for the most part been satisfied with the food and service.  Today however, this was not the case. This is the second time that I have been to this location and was a little underwhelmed the first visit by the service, not the food. I know this happens so decided to stop by here to satisfy a burger craving.  We were seated and waited 12 minutes before we were approached by our server. I was shocked that she was our server because she had been assisting the two neighboring tables and never acknowledged us. Anyway...she took our drink orders and returned a few minutes later with the drinks and took our food order. I ordered my usual ( cheeseburger with bleu cheese, cooked well) the husband ordered the same . The lady that delivered the food was very nice and offered to get us ranch for our fries...that was nice of her.  My burger had a cold bun...I frowned and thought..well..as long as the meat is cooked and hot I can overlook it, and it was and I dug in. The husband took a bite and spit his out...it was cold..the bun and the burger, plus it was raw inside...not a little pink....it was raw. We got our servers attention after about 10 minutes ( she only had 2 other tables by the way). She apologized and offered to correct the situation...the new burger was delivered and was fine.   By this time we had been out of drinks for a while and really needed to quench our thirst...but our server was nowhere to be found. She finally comes over..after being prompted by us raising our hands...LOL...why did I raise my hand??? Imma dork. We let her know we would like some refills on our drinks and some extra fries...away she goes.5 minutes later our fries arrive...not form her...from another worker. We waited...waited....waited....20 minutes have now passed. We see our server offer to box the people's food next to us, she brought their check, she served another table their refills, came back to the other table and bullshitted for a few minutes. At this point I was pissed and saw a manager and motioned for him to come over..explained the ordeal...and he comped 50% of the bill...thanks Alex that was nice of you...I wish we could have left you the tip and not her. He brought us the check...she totally avoided us for the rest of the time we were there.  So...Alisha....your job is to be a server. This means that you take food and drink orders, deliver food, refill drinks, and make sure that we have a pleasant dining experience. I know that I pride myself in my job...and when I make a mistake I will be the first to admit and try to make ammends. I am not being harsh or rude...this is just basic skills that a person in this job should have. I know not everyone will have a knock out personality...or huge boobs, or a great smile. But Alisha...come on ...you could have at least apologized for the oversight.  The conclusion is that I will NEVER go to this particular RED ROBIN...thanks to Alisha...it would just be awkward to have to see her again. I will continue to go to the one off 99th and McDowell...and then soon they will have one even closer to me...OOH JOY !!!  P.S. The one star is for the nice manager that genuinely felt bad about our experience and the nice lady that offered the ranch.

My husband took me here on a Friday night ...after hearing good things about it from coworkers.  We sat on the patio which had plenty of misters and overlooked a park, it was a very relaxing environment.  Our server, Carla, was as cute as could be and was so nice the entire evening. She was one of the most attentive servers that I have had in a long time. She was so genuine and really added to the experience that we had here...thank you Carla !!!  We ordered a bottle of red wine that the husband picked, I am not sure what it was but it was damn good ($23 for the bottle). As an appetizer we had the Piatto Misto, which was an assortment of Italian meats, cheeses, olives , and breadsticks ($14) and this is definetly enough for 2-3 people. The meats were excellent and the cheese was tasty also. My only recommendation would be for them to not cut the cheese into tiny little cubes...that was odd because the meat was sliced and you could not incorporate it very well.  For dinner we shared a pizza.. The Sofia..it had Scamorza (Smoked Mozzarella),Parma Prosciutto,Parmigiano Reggiano ($13). It was ooh soo tasty. We could not eat the whole thing...there was like 3 pieces that we ended up having boxed up.  Then we had dessert.....I am still in heaven just thinking about this dessert. It was the Dolce Della Casa...Slightly Charred Sweet Calzone filled with Chocolate Hazelnut Sauce and Banana topped with Vanilla Ice Cream...OOOOOhhh my God. This was by far the best dessert that I have had in a while. It was so gratifying...I had goosebumps after the first bite. I would recommend ordering a small and sharing it because it was huge ($7). I can die a happy woman after that dessert...and if this was a first date ...that would have been a guarantee for sex !!!   The community here in Verrado was absolutely amazing, I wish I would have known about this neighborhood before I bought my house in Goodyear. If you live nearby I would recommend checking this place out and spending time looking around the  neighborhood.

I do not like this KFC ...or any really for that matter. Every time I have been here the place is filthy. I know they remolded the place and I have not been since then, so I am not sure if the conditions are the same.  The food is just not good in any way anymore. Not that it was ever great, but you could get some decent chicken and some sides and be content. What the hell have they done to the mac & cheese? It is so gross..the color is just not appealing and the taste is worse. Food at this place has been served under temperature enough times to keep me from returning.

I have to say...there are not many times that food is good enough to surpass not so good service. This is one of those times.   I went here on a Friday night for a drink and a light dinner with my husband and daughter. When the server came over I asked if they have Margaritas...and she said yeah...what kind I asked?? UUUhhhh the red and the green one was the response...I was so shocked by this I could not even get angry...I laughed very hard on the inside. Anyway..I ordered the "green" margarita on the rocks ($4.50) and it was not too bad. The husband had the happy hour beer special for $2 and got 2 coronas.  To eat the husband and I shared the 3 taco plate and added an extra taco. We got 2 carne asada and 2 barbacoa with rice and beans ($8.95). The tacos were soooo yummy...lots and lots of meat with a sprinkling of cilantro and onion ...and thats it...the way tacos should be. They were served on a homemade corn tortilla that was thick and delicious. The barbacoa was our favorite and I found myself taking very small bites to make it last as long as possible. The rice and beans were perfect also.  My daughter had already eaten dinner so she ordered the sopapillas. They were totally like grandma makes...and were served in a brown paper bag piled high and accompanied by the little bear honey to drizzle on their already sweet goodness.  When we were done the husband decided he wanted to take home a taco with each of the different meats they offer ( I think are like 6 or more types of meat ) Which by the way when I asked what a certain kind of meat was that I had never heard of before to our server she told me to read the menu...thanks!! Anyway...sadly the were out of every meat except the two we already had...so we just got the 2 tacos 2 go. When the server brought them to us she was like...so are you done NOW? LOL...wow.  I do not think she meant to rude....I just think she was not experienced. But hey...I will definetly go back and am looking forward to trying their other menu items.  Go check this place out...and they serve Menudo all day Saturday and Sunday.

I went here on Father's Day morning for some breakfast after a late night. It was very busy, but we were seated within 30 minutes. My husband and I both ordered from their choose 4 items for $6.95. For the most part everything was decent except my biscuit was hard as a rock around the edges and my husband's french toast was served cold...the huge pat of butter they put on top was hard and cold and because they french toast was cold, it did not melt. I was ok with overlooking my biscuit, but the husband wanted some new french toast, as he should.  It took 20 minutes for us to get someone's attention about the french toast, and it was the manager on duty. We told her it was served cold, instead of asking if we would like a new one she asked if wanted a to-go box???? I said no, why would we want to take it? She then offers to heat it in the microwave...again I told her no, it ruins it when you heat in the microwave, and I said we just want a new one. She then insists that we take it home and just freeze it and then have it later because this is what she does. She says they are busy and it will take forever to get a new one. At this point I tell her we do not want it all and we just want the bill so we can leave. She deducted $2. I was very disappointed in the way she handled this situation, I tried to call a manager at the restaurant to complain about her and she picked up the line, when I asked for another manager, she hung up!!  ** We did buy a Boston Cream Pie to take home, and it was delicious**

Weak happy hour margarita, ended up buying a shot of Patron' to make it yummy. Also ordered their sampler platter for $10.95 ( apps are half off during happy hour) thank goodness because if I would have paid full price for this I would have been pissed. Nothing was good at all, and it bugs the crap out  of me when Mexican restaurants add soooo much "filler" to  their shredded beef and chicken...you know like tons of onion, celery, peppers, and very little actual meat.   Our server was ok, but we were sitting next to the server station and all we heard were employees complaining about customers and talking shit about other employees. No bueno.

Went here to satisfy my craving for eggs benedict with my husband. We both got the basic benedict with the home fries. I also ordered some blueberry muffins and a mimosa. My husband asked to keep the lunch/dinner menu to look it over because we have only had breakfast here and wanted to look at the menu while we waited. They were not busy at all but our server kept asking if we were done looking at it..after asking about three times it got annoying and we just put it down and she immediately scooped it up, it was just weird.  When the food came all looked great and we dug in. I was happy and looked over to see how the husband liked his and saw a horrified look on his face. He had taken a bite and looked down and saw a very large hair on the egg. Also both or our home fries were cold...which has been an issue before. We got new potatoes and a new benedict and both were delivered by a manager that apologized for the inconvenience and hoped this would be better. All was fine until we got the bill and we were not compensated in any way, we even waited a while to see if the manager would come over and do or say something. Another manager was walking around and we called her over and told her what happened. We were told the girl was new and they would of course comp the meal. She actually ended up comping the entire bill..even my mimosa...and that is where the 1 star comes in. That was really great that she did that and it was very much appreciated. We tipped the girl $10 ( our bill was $29.54).  Although they did remedy the situation and went above and beyond what they had to do...finding hair in food and having the issue with the cold food more than twice, is just not acceptable. I was also surprised that since our server was new that when the manager got involved with the issue that they would make sure that it was resolved correctly...or the manager that first came by could have made a gesture at that time to let us know the meal would be taken off the bill. Instead it was blamed on the server...I don't like that at all.   I may go to another Mimi's..just not this one

Went here for a company party and was very impressed with the food and the service. My absolute favorite thing I ate was the lamb chops. They were amazing, they had so much flavor and were cooked perfectly. The filet is up there with the best I have ever had.   We were treated like royalty by the staff, but they were down to earth as well. I had a fabulous time here and would recommend this place to everyone!

I love this place, everything I have had has been delicious, pizza, sandwiches, calzones, and the bread sticks( especially with the pesto sauce to dip it in ). But, if you really want something yummy, you MUST try the apple pie dessert pizza, its amazing!

Won a contest on Facebook for a $10 gift certificate back in April, never received it. Messaged them 3 times and confirmed my address, was told they were sending it. NOTHING! They have also stopped returning my messages. Very unprofessional.

Ordered an XL pizza last night for the kids...this was the smallest XL pizza I have ever seen!!! I even called to make sure that it was the right size, and was told that they were positive that we got the XL. It was not that great, and was not worth almost $20. Will not order from them again.

My daughter got very sick from eating a burger here and when we complained the manager did give us a free meal if we returned. We went back a few months later and my husband got sick this time after eating some wings. I have not been impressed with the food  overall here and the service has been even worse. I have never been to the bar area here...only the restaurant. I would never go back and would not recommend this particular Native New Yorker.

why did I go back here?? I have no idea, but I will not be back ...ever! Ordered the buffalo chicken bites and the chicken was so overcooked that it was hard as a rock..yuck!  And also there was only one server..which was ok because they were not busy, however, she decided to go out to have a smoke and then returned to our table to see how we were doing and the smell made me sick..do not go smoke and then return to a table smelling like that..very gross.

I go to red Robin a few times a year with the kids at their request, and usually have decent experience with the food and service. This particular burger treck was done as a result of a free burger offer for my son's 15th birthday.  After the experince of my husband's meal and my own...I have decided that burger's are the ONLY choice here for me personally.  The husband ordered the salmon fish and chips and was pealing off the mushy and greasy batter after the second bite. After doing this we almost could not tell if this was salmon or some breed of white fish...it was so pale and lethargic we were not even sure it was salmon...however we were assured by our server it was legit. I tried a bite it was not good at all.  I ordered their "steak" sliders. Upon taking mu first bite I almost ripped out my 2 front teeth. Not only was the meat full of grissle, bit the taste and texture of the meat made me gag. These were not edible and I asked our server for a replacement (which he did gladly) and was told by the server that this happens a lot with sliders ( the grissle). My alternate was a cheeseburger with bleu cheese ( this was fine).   This was not a horrible experience, I just will stick to their burger menu in the future.  P.S. The visit was also made more exciting by a female employee sitting at their of the restaurant crying hysterically for about 10 minutes and then proceeded to curse out someone on her cell phone !!

I have been to this place twice now and although there were some items that I was not a fan of...overall the food and service has been great !  The place is small and cozy and the owners are very involved with every aspect of the restaurant. You can tell that the owners are passionate about what they do and you can tell that care about your business.  Yummy items that I have tried and loved are: Hummus: Even if this was not homemade ( as indicated in a previous post) I do not care ...it was sooo good.  The house soup..can't remember the name??? It is like a greek version of chicken soup. It is light and delicious and I absolutely love it !!  Baked Ravioli in Alfredo sauce: I have had this twice and I will be getting it again and again...it was so gooey and flavorful.  Steak and Lobster: This was a special on Valentines Day and both were cooked to perfection and needed nothing added to it whatsoever. This came with steamed veggies and red potatoes...also cooked perfectly.  Flaming Baklava: This I have had twice also...it is baklava in all it's glory with scoop of vanilla ice cream and drizzled with orange liquer which the light on fire when they bring to your table.  Not so yummy : (   Grape leaves: These were OK..I have had worse at My Big Fat Greek Restaurant...my main complaint with these was there was too much leaf and too much raw garlic.  Spanakopita ( Spinach Pie): This looked delicious and had fresh spinach...but no flavor whatsoever...NONE  Meatballs: Again too much raw garlic.  All in all the good stuff that we have had and the great service we have received will keep me coming back to this place

Unfortunately because of an issue with the service and the owner i will not return to this place.  What happened? Well, we decided to go to dinner here and sit out on the patio because it was a beautiful night.  When we sat I noticed they had the kitchen door propped open, which is a huge pet peeve for me, not only is it against regulation, it is gross. Anything can make it's way into the kitchen and into the food that is being prepared. I wanted to mention this to my server to see if it could be corrected. In the meantime 2 employees decided to grab a smoke right outside the kitchen door, one of which was the owner's wife. This really agitated me and thought it was disgusting.  When the server returned I voiced my opinion and she apologized and said she would tell the owner. About 10 minutes later one of the employees that I saw smoking came out on the patio to steal a few drags off a friend's cigarette while the whole time just staring at me...as she walked past our table she blew the smoke right over to our table and smiled.   At this point I was furious and just wanted to pay and leave. When the server returned I explained what happened and that I wondered if she had mentioned the situation yet to the owner. She said she would let him know. A few moments later the owner came to our table and said.." do we have a problem"? and it was not said in a nice way at all....I even doubted what I heard him say and asked what he said. Again he looked at my husband and said..."do you have a problem" and then turned to me and said the same thing. He was soooo rude I was speechless. I just said....nope ...we do not have a problem, we just will not come back. He just turned around and walked away.  I am not sure why he responded this way, but I will not come back to a place where the manager has such disregard to one of their customers "problems".    Too bad Dino's...I liked most of your food, but you let me down.

Great burgers !!! One of the best I have had since I have been here in Phoenix. I love the ranch burger..a regular cheeseburger but they add a mayo/ranch concoction. Its too good. They always have a meal deal for $5.95 that includes fries and a drink.

I tried this place for the first time and ordered their special on Sunday of enchiladas,eggs, and beans. My daughter ordered the taco salad. The chips and salsa arrived with a small bowl of chips and huge bowl of salsa ( very amusing). The chips had a burnt taste to them but did not appear burnt. Did not eat emm. When our plates arrived the taco salad was typical, served in the fried tostada bowl and her words were, "it's ok". My plate looked ok until I noticed I had only one fried egg on my plate...strange..they usually come in pairs. When I mentioned this to our waitress, she said there should be 2 and said she would get it taken care of. A few moments later she arrived with a plate with a very raw egg on it. It was not even fried...it almost looked like a poached egg...but raw.I showed our waitress and she said that it didn't like right to her either , but the cook told her to serve it to me. I was upset...with situation and asked to speak to a manager. He arrived and I explained the events and he said.."well I didn't see the egg, so I am not sure what happened". I assured him it was raw and he said he was sorry and that he ask the cook about it and he left. he did not offer any compensation for it and as a matter of fact the waitress is the one that gave me an employee discount. The manager did not appear to care about the situation and the cook obviously could not even cook an egg...I will not return.

The food here is average and for a reasonable price. There is decent live music on Saturday nights.  The service however, really bad. Our server never mentioned to us that they had a special wine flight available for the night, we overheard another server telling our neighbor. We never received our waters, after asking 3 times over about a 30 minute period. After we ordered our dessert we waited another 45 minutes before our server returned, we asked for the bill and waited about 15 more minutes. The table next to us that had the same server were equally annoyed by the server's absence. The owner/manager was walking around and tried getting his attention, and was told he would get back to me in a moment, but never returned before we left.  This is a very small place and they could do really well in terms of service if they had the right people and the right training...... I MIGHT come back in a few months to see if the service has improved...but be warned.

I live right down the street from here and decided to come in with my husband for some food and drinks. The place was pretty busy when we arrived and we were told that we could sit anywhere. The only place available to sit was on the picnic tables outside, which would have been fine if they were clean. ALL the picnic tables were covered in cigarette ashes and sticky stuff. A server came by and explained a trivia game they were playing and took a good 5 minutes with this. Never asked if we wanted anything, he just left, and so did we.  The employees that we came in contact with had no people skills at all and were not very accommodating helping us find a seat. The place was also very dirty and run down, will not be back here.

Service was terrible here. We told the hostess it was our first time here and she sat us outside, and it was cold that night and I had no jacket. There were people smoking at an outside bar that was making me ill. When I asked about the smoking they said that there was smoking on the outside patio, when asked to be moved I was told that it could be 45 minutes to an hour wait. So we stayed.   Mu husband ordered the cuban sandwich and I had a burger. We also ordered drinks..I got the chambard margarita and he had a jack and coke. Food was expensive for what we got and the portions were very small. My drink was horrible and made me feel sick after I drank it, the husband says he swore they gave him crown and coke..and was weak as all hell.   I was baffled that this is Margaritaville and they serve the drinks in plastic cups...WHY???? I was expecting a fun or fancy glass. I was sad.  Not impressed at all with this place...and would not really want to go back, just don't see any reason to.

My husband and i went here early evening on Saturday (about 5:45pm). The place is very close to where we live and wanted to give it a shot. There was only 3 other tables that were occupied so we were seated right away. Our table had a balance issue that my husband solved by placing a napkin under one of the legs. The place was tastefully decorated, nothing too special.   We were greeted right away by our server and were informed about the happy hour specials that were still good until 6pm. I quickly ordered a wine flight for each of us ($2 off each flight) and an appetizer of chicken satay with pineapple salsa ( $8). We received our wines and they were all very delicious. I had the chardonnay flight ( $10) and the husband had the merlot flight ($12).   Then the appetizer came. It was 3 skewers of chicken planted into a thick slice of grilled pineapple and a side of the salsa. I tried to take a bite of it and it was too chewy. I used my fork to slide it off the skewer and ended up getting a work out. This was way overcooked and way overseasoned. We had to put plenty of the sweet salsa on the chicken to balance out the amount of salt that was used for the chicken. So...not impressed with the satay.  For the entree we ordered the blackened salmon with risotto and veggies. They were out of risotto so we chose the goat cheese mashed potatoes instead. The salmon had a good flavor but was overcooked and the mashed potatoes were very good, even though I would have never knew that there was goat cheese in there. The server came over and told us that since we were sharing that if we wanted more veggies to let her know, my husband said sure I will have some. She ended up bringing out some weird stir fry veggies which did not come with the original meal ( we had steamed veggies) and we were charged $4 extra for these when the bill arrived. She really misled us, I thought she was OFFERING them.   We ordered the chocolate crepe with fresh fruit and creme fresh for desert ($8).The crepe was horrible in flavor and texture. The berries and creme that were inside were delicious.  The wine here is reasonable, and there are not many places in the westside that have this type of selection. i may go back for the wine...and that is it. The food did not impress me at all and I am so glad that the husband and I shared the plates we did get. This is usually what we do when we go for the first time to a place that is a little pricey. That way if the food is bad we do not spend so much.   This place may have some food that could be good, but I am not willing to take that chance. I would like to see a little more quality in the food here than what we received. I mean I have had better chicken satay at a backyard BBQ.

This place is great !!!  I had the $5 deal (Any burger, fries, soda) I just got the cheeseburger and it was charbroiled deliciousness !!! Also had an order of their cheesesticks...which come with ranch, I thought I was the only one that dipped this in ranch...guess not...they were awesome and cheap ($3.50) and come with like 6 sticks.  We sat in the back at the picnic tables and one of the employees even came out to see how everything was and let me use their restroom even though it was not a public restroom.  The food here is delicious, cheap, and the people working here are very friendly and appreciate your business.  I will be going back and will be telling others to check this place out.

I am not too picky about where I get my car washed as long as they do a good job and do not damage anything. Most places that I have been are pretty equal as far as the type of car wash they give. I have noticed however that the folks trying to get you to replace your windshield and buy other services are just too overwhelming. This place is especially bad about it to the point that the last time I went I left pissed off about the whole thing. They are not the only car wash that does this, most major car washes are doing the same thing. I understand trying to upsell to make money, but they can be very persistently annoying and sometimes even insulting.

Creepy manager here....has a lazy eye and is constantly grabbing and slapping the girls asses when they passed by. He insulted my husband for wearing a Chargers jersey....which I know happens in man land..but he is a manager and thought it was outta line.  I usually dont complain about the food here because it rarely is special, but my son was served a boneless wing that was frozen, and they were supposed to have a bbq sauce on them and they were just fried. When called the manager over he swore that the wings had sauce on them...it was more than obvious they were sauceless. As for the frozen chicken...he did not even address it. He did not offer new chicken..he just came with the bill...and deducted the wings. He never said another word to us.

Service was awful. Waited forever for Everything. It was hot as hell this day and asked for ice water after waiting 10 minutes when sat, also ordered other drinks ....waited & waited, got the alcoholic drinks & no water. Had to ask another server for ice water, came to me with like 4 tiny ice cubes, Lol. My California roll arrived looking very plain, had to ask for the wasabi & ginger. Waited to eat 10 min while waiting for utensils. The monkey balls would have been better if they weren't drowned in the spicy mayo, it was way too much. We had 4 different people during our visit serving us, which was very confusing. There were a lot of flies too, and was constantly shooing them away. Only things that were good were the shrimp tempura & my martinis. Happy hour pricing is great, but the bad service is not worth it, and the quality of sushi I had was not good.

This place was perfect...cute place, in a great location. Loved the inside and the patio area. Service here was great all around, servers were friendly and took good care of us on our visit.  I had the wingless buffalo dip and I would order that dish a million times and not get tired of it, perfect munchie food too. For my entree I had the Bleu Inside Out Burger and it was amazing, dripping with juicy goodness from the burger and the cheese. I also tried some of my daughter's Salmon BLT, and it was superb.   I can't wait to come back here and try some of their other dishes. Happy hour specials are great, I had $3 house wine and most of the appetizers are $5, get over there and try it out.

The place is small and cute. We tried all the flavors and I got a small cup with a few toppings and thoroughly enjoyed it. I would go back if I had the craving for ice cream. It is a little pricey to me, but then again most ice cream places are now these days. It is missing something...just not sure what.

Took the whole family to check this place out on a Saturday. The place is very nicely decorated, however the chairs have  like a wicker type material and my shirt kept getting snagged on it, bummer.  Our server was really bad...no personality at all. I did notice the other servers were having a great time with other guests and were very friendly, but alas....not ours.  We all ordered typical dishes, tacos, rice, beans. I got a special of three different tacos : ground beef (YUCKY!!), shredded beef (OK), and chicken (OK). The problem was the tortilla that the taco was in...as soon as I went to pick it up the bottom was filled with grease that it went to pieces...all of them. My husband is Mexican...I have had every kind of taco under the sun...this tortilla ordeal was not acceptable.  When our server returned I showed him the evidence and was told that this how the tacos are served...they fall apart..there's nothing he can do. Yes...this is what he said. Then he just turns around and leaves. Then a cook from the back comes out and asks if I had a problem with the tacos...I said yes...look. He apologizes and offers to make a new one and I gladly oblige. New tacos come out with the appropriate casing. But as stated earlier the filling are not that great.  Our server never returned after that...ever. We had to ask another server for our bill, and they brought it to us...not our server. Told the manager on the way out about the situation and he gave us one free meal on next visit. I have not returned at this time ...we will see what happens next time.  Bottom line about this place is that it is average mexican food that is in no way fabulous or special. Also overpriced for the quality of what you get . I have better at a local taco shop.It also annoys me when these places serve a taco with ground beef and screw that up. I really think that ground beef should not be used in mexican restaurants at all. I really need to stop going to these types of mexican restaurants...I am always disappointed.   Good luck to you on your visit.

On three occasions I came here in the morning, about 6am. Went through the drive-thru and was told they are only accepting cash?? When asked why, the lady said "Because that's what we're doing right now". No receipt, nothing. Weird. I had a few dollars on me the first time and paid. After that I had to leave because I had no cash. Tried to call and talk to a manager the first time and was hung up on twice. I don't know what the hell is going on at this location, but the management needs to step up and get this place clean and hire competent employees.

Went through the drive thru for a large iced tea. The girl hands me the tea and says they are out of Styrofoam cups that the tea usually comes in. No problem, I take it and drive off and notice the cup has food debris all over the outside. So I park and also see there is only about 4-6 ice cubes in my tea. I go inside and tell the person at the counter what the issue was. He takes the cup, didn't say a word, and hands me a new one..IN A STYROFOAM CUP! I tell him the girl in the drive thru said you were out... he points over to the huge stack behind him and said "she lied".

Today I ate here and the beans were way too salty to eat and the rice was almost the same, but a little more tolerable. Wanted to send it back, but my husband insisted that I let it go.   Also, one of the worker's had a child running around the restaurant ( about 5 years old), and he was touching everything ( silverware, napkins, toothpicks) it was horrible!! The child was climbing on the front counter and running back and forth and sliding on the floor.   I may give the place another try in the future because I have had good food here in the past. Sorry Filiberto's :(

I realllly loved this place!! The whole family went and we each ordered the three tacos for $5 and some change, the chips and salsa $2.95, and we also got their flavored lemonade. We got the fish tacos, carne asada, pork, chicken, and chicken feta tacos....we all loved them and the problem was not being able to finish them. We could only eat two and ended up eating the other one later. I got mine without the cabbage and was pleased that I did because it would have been too much. I love that they put rice and beans in their tacos because this is how we do it at home. The lemonade was so delicious...I had the pomagranite and I was wishing they had free refills. The chips and salsa was very good as well and they give you plenty of salsa.  The place is adorable and they folks that work there were friendly and helpful with suggestions on what to get. I will be back to this place and also want everyone to check them!!

I was disappointed in my last visit, I had the 3 tacos ( carne asada and red beef). The carne asada was really bad...tons of fat and grissle, I was only able to take 3 bites and I could not do no more. The red beef had good flavor, the problem was that the meat is cooked in a broth, so when they put it in the taco the whole tortilla was soaked and falling apart..I ended up having to pick at it with a fork.  My husband had a carne asada burrito..again the meat was not good and he did not like the cabbage ..it looked old and tasted old.  The service was solid and there are other things that I like about the place...but they need some quality control..who wants to eat fatty carne asada and soggy tacos???   Two hippies if you are out there reading this..please...address some of these issues, I really want to come back.

Great place, especially for happy hour ( 3-7 m-f) and they have a late night happy hour that starts at 10pm , i think. They have beer specials, martinis are $5.95 and almost every appetizer is half off. I have never had a bad meal here. Some of the entrees are pricey but the food is good.

This Ross is fairly new and is not nearly as crowded as most Ross stores, so you don't have to wait 10 years in line to check out. The store is clean and the staff have always been very friendly. The only issue is that they are not as  well stocked with merchandise as most other stores, but I am sure that will change over time.

I had the Italian Hoagie and even though the sandwich was a huge portion, I was just not happy with it. It  was way too dry and would have probably tasted much better if it had been toasted. They do have good prices and may be a good place to have an affordable meal.

The service at this location was great, until one of the servers managed to incorporate throwing up in into a conversation while I was nursing a hangover. Never a good idea to talk throwing up to a customer that is eating.duh!! This conversation led to more inappropriate words from the employee until he finally left....grrrrr!!!  Had the biscuits& gravy special ( $10.95 ), no bueno. I like my gravy simple...just some gravy with a little sausage running through,thats it. Can't stand it when there is onions, peppers, celery, carrot...yuck!! And they served those generic potatoes that are big flavorless cubes that they put in the deep fryer. Should have just had the chicken and waffle, lesson learned.

I really like their carnitas tacos and the special they have with a beef tamale, 3 rolled tacos and a drink for $6.95. They also have some good salsas in their salsa bar. I have heard they make great fish tacos and seafood burritos!!   You also must try their cinnamon treats!!

Twice I have gotten honey seared shrimp to-go and 3 of the "shrimp" was nothing but batter. The first time I contacted the manager and was invited to come in and have a free meal, I obliged, and it was delicious. But the next week, same thing happened. Plus the shrimp that were shrimp were mostly batter too. There was also a lot of food debris on the outside of my food containers, which was not very appetizing. Please get your shit together Pei Wei.

I have been here twice to get the bacon cheeseburger w/fries for $6 and thoroughly  it enjoyed it both times. I also had their black tea ( free refills ) and it was very refreshing and delicious. My daughter had the chicken fried steak and eggs and she was a happy girl. The gentleman in the store that helped us was super friendly and very helpful.

I thoroughly enjoyed the eggs benedict w/portuguese sausage...excellent!! My son had the carnitas tacos and thought it was best thing he's tasted in a while....we actually received the tacos for free because a server dropped some sauce on my son on accident....I was amazed & delighted by this gesture : )  They also had great specials on mimosas..I believe they were $3 for brunch on Saturday.  I will be back here to enjoy other dishes on the menu.

I usually try to check out a restaurants health inspection before I go there...this time I did not. The pizza was alright, nothing special, my daughter wanted to go because I think she liked the guy behind the counter. Anyway, after going home and looking them up I discovered they have failed their last 2 inspections for things like debris on their meat slicer, food not at correct temps, and worst of all there was indication that they were either smoking in the kitchen, smoking outside with the kitchen door open, or both. This is unacceptable to me that employees of a food establishment would even think this was ok...here is the link to look them up and other restaurants http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/business_search.aspx?as_page_title=Food%20Establishments%20Search&as_type=Food

Came here on a Saturday afternoon..had some wine & beer..both were fabulous...my husband really enjoyed the amber ale infused with raspberry.  We decided to share the mac & cheese, not a fan of this AT ALL. Maybe it's just my personal preference...I thought it was not creamy enough, the bottom was burnt to a crisp, there was way too much green chili in it, and the very very thick layer of cheddar on top was not tasting good at all. We could only take a few bites and had to stop.   We shared some vanilla ice cream & it was perfect. The service was great all around. We did have quite a few different folks helping us, but they were all wonderful, and this didn't bother me at all. We sat on the patio and enjoyed the day while looking at all the cute doggies that were coming in. They are VERY dog friendly here, and I love that!  I will return and would like to come in the evening and maybe try one of their sandwiches, they looked really good as they were passing by.

I really do think that I could live off their chicken mole tacos and the salsa bar! The service was wonderful, the food was above and beyond, and I am addicted to their cilantro salsa.   The chicken mole tacos were overflowing with meat and topped with just a bit of pickled onions, perfection. Their quesadillas .....as delicious as they are, are not figure friendly. They are homemade corn tortillas stuffed with various meats, cheeses and veggies and then deep fried. I had the Oaxaca cheese & char-broiled Arrachera steak, which was ooozing out on delivery. Waaay more than I bargained for, good thing I was sharing. These are very indulgent and intensely tasty.  Once I got a little into trying all their salsas, I decided to mix the cilantro salsa and the chipotle salsa...WOW!!  This was my husband's idea, have to give him credit.   If you haven't been here already...go...if you have been here...go back, I know I will.

I was very disappointed by my last 2 visits here. On one visit I was served cold beans and rice, like from the fridge cold. It took almost 20 minutes to get new beans and rice, and they were still barely warm. No apology, no nothing.  Went again to get my favorite chicken mole tacos, and they were barely warm. My husband had their marinated shredded pork in a burrito and got sick after taking the first bite. This must be an acquired taste, it was gross, really gross. Then I found what looked like a gray slimy booger in my rice. When I pointed it out to the server he took my plate away and came back saying it was an onion!! No way was that an onion, or even a close relative of an onion. No apology, no asking if i want something else, he just came over, slammed the bill down and said we didn't charge you for your food, so don't worry about it, and walked away.   I know mistakes happen, but own up to it, and at least TRY to make the customer feel good about the situation.

Was told by the woman in the pharmacy that I had to pay cash for my prescriptions because I didn't have insurance. I could not use a debit card or credit card according to her, only cash. I asked to speak to a manager and she said no one was available. I needed the medication immediately for my son because he couldn't breathe. This can't be proper procedures.

I always check my card before I leave to see how much I have left. On my last visit here I went to add money to the card and saw that the $4 that was on there last week was now gone. I went to the woman at the counter and explained what happened. She tells me that the computer resets the cards every month?!! I asked what does that mean? Why would my money that I just had last week be taken off? When does the computer reset, because it is the 20th of the month today?? She could answer nothing, just kept shrugging her shoulders and saying that's just what happens. This should be illegal! At no point or nowhere does it say that after getting the card (which is the only way to use the machines) that  if you don't use it all that it is removed when the computer resets...The whole thing makes no sense and seems suspicious.

Just started here about 2 weeks ago and have loved it. Everyone has been very nice, the place is modern and very clean. I have never had a problem getting on a machine, and I have gone during various times in the day and evening. They provide soap, shampoo, lotion, razors, q-tips, deodorant , and hair dryers.

I took my son here for a quick bite before his hair appointment down the street. He had chicken & fries for $3.99 and I had 3 shrimp & fries for $1.99 with a breaded fish for 99 cents extra. The fish, shrimp, and chicken were average of what you would expect here...the fries on the other hand had a stale taste to them..kinda like they were left  open in the freezer and got freezer burn on them..they were not edible to me.  However....the real kicker here was that while I was eating my food, I turn to look out the window and see a Long John Silvers employee out by the street waving a sign for their special for the day..and all the while she was smoking a cigarette...actually she smoked 3 cigarettes. I did wait until I was ready to leave and went and let the manager know how unappetizing it was to see this...all she was mad about was the fact that the girl was on the clock & smoking. People never cease to amaze me!!

This is a great place for breakfast. They serve large potions and it is delicious. They have some awesome thick cut bacon that is cooked perfectly every time. The service is always friendly and fast. The place does get a little packed on the weekends, but it is worth the wait.

Found hair in my food, waited forever to get a new plate. When bill arrived I took it to the manager and asked if that meal could be removed. He walks away without saying a word and returns with another guy and they both start cussing at me in front of my 2 year old grandson and said they were calling the cops if I didn't pay. I said I shouldn't pay for a meal that was delivered with a hair in it & that I will be contacting the health department. Both men then got in my face and told me to leave, as I'm leaving and scared to death of these two, the male kitchen staff also came out calling me a stupid bitch, made it to my car and got the hell out of there. Weirdest and scariest restaurant experience of my life, stay away from this place!!!

Just moved not too far away from here and decided to come in for brunch on Sunday. The place is cute as can be and I love that you can see what's going on in the kitchen. The service here was superb, very friendly and helpful, made my dining experience even better.   Their brunch menu is very basic, but let me tell you, they are cooking this food right!! I had the monster egg sandwich with egg over medium, provolone, and the most delicious sausage served on a giant pretzel bun...mmmmm!!! They are making this sausage themselves folks, they aren't messing around. My husband had the " Before & After", this consisted of eggs, potatoes, and a grilled chicken breast...all was perfectly cooked and yummy. Also filled up on the $10 mimosa pitcher, really hit the spot.  I will definitely be back here again and again.

Came here late on Saturday to the bar side to have some food and drinks. The place was pretty packed on the outside patio despite the heat, and they had some good music playing.  I had the most amazing burger here, no joke. A nice size burger patty on a pretzel bun  covered with their own cheese sauce that was oozing out of the sides of my burger and topped with 2 huge pieces of bacon..thats it!! WOW!! So much flavor.... I was in aahhh with every bite. I was sharing this with the husband and I didn't want to give up the other half. Fries were just my style, super skinny & crispy, topped with parmesan and garlic...mmmmm!! Also had the coconut chicken tenders with citrus honey ginger sauce, chicken was cooked wonderfully and that dipping sauce made it extra special.  My husband had the bartender make a grape martini for me, it was perfect, and after 2 of them I was done.   All I can say is YUM  !!

I brought the family here on a Saturday for a nice breakfast and was pleasantly surprised at how wonderful the food was. I had just a basic breakfast of eggs, sausage, and potatoes. All was cooked perfectly and I really enjoyed their potatoes, they were very tasty & reminded me of my own yummy potatoes. I also got a side order of the biscuits & chorizo gravy to split with my son & husband. OOH MY ....it was perfect, this is a must try. The chorizo gravy is not on the menu, you have to ask for it. My son had the burger and it came out HUGE, according to him, it was all that a diner burger should be. The husband had the chorizo scramble w/potatoes and a side of french toast, and again, all yummy.  I really enjoyed the diner atmosphere and noticed while sitting there that there were a lot of regulars, I even noticed that people could bring in their own coffee cup and keep it there...love that kinda place!!   The service was great! We were well taken care of from start to finish. I will definitely be back and suggest you check it out too.  Oh...almost forgot. This place is VERY affordable. For example, the side of biscuits and gravy was $2.99, and my breakfast was $6.99.

I have been here twice now on the weekend for late night coffee and dessert. They have all the normal coffee drinks, scones, cookies, and lots of crepes( sweet & savory ).   I have had the cinnamon & sugar crepe and the lemon and powdered sugar one. Both crepes were cooked perfectly, they could have used a little more of the flavoring in the crepes, but overall they were good. My italian creme soda they made me really hit the spot ( i am not a coffee drinker). My husband really enjoyed his iced toddy and their other hot coffees.   Service was  great and this place is open 24 hours on Friday & Saturday nights...go check them out.

The cupcakes here are AMAZING !! I tried the red velvet, peanut butter, coconut, chocolate raspberry, sugar cookie, samoa ( like the girl scout cookie ), and strawberry. All of them were moist and the most divine frosting you can imagine. My favorite was the strawberry, there was fresh strawberry in the frosting and the cake, man that thing was good!  The cost per cupcake varied a little...on average they were $2.75 each and well worth every penny.  Please do yourself a favor and check this place out. They also have other treats like cookies and pies, and they serve breakfast & lunch items.

I ordered the seafood mix plate (fried shrimp, fried fish, BBQ chicken). I asked for french fries instead of the macaroni salad, I was charged $1 more. The fries were crinkle cut and saturated with oil, they were gross. The shrimp and fish were ok, and the rice too. The chicken was terrible, it was tough and stringy and I just wanted to stop eating it. I would never get that again, or recommend it. The place was clean and the service friendly.

I have been here twice in the last week and loved it! The place is now called, The Burger Shack. On my first visit I had a hot dog covered in bacon, shredded cheese, guacamole, and mustard....it was perfect.   Next visit I had their BBQ Bacon Burger...the burgers here are cooked on the grill, with real fire...amazing burger.   They are serving a small selection of breakfast items all day, hot dogs, burgers, and some sandwiches. The owners here are nice and friendly and go out of their way to give great customer service...and the place was VERY clean on both visits.

This is the best smoke shop that I have been to in Phoenix. Mostly because the staff that they have working here are down to earth, very friendly and helpful. They have excellent prices on their merchandise, and sometimes they will even take off a few dollars from your purchase or just give you a great deal.

Been here twice for happy hour and have been disappointed both times. We had the same server each time and she was terrible, friendly, but just not a good server. I had to ask several times for ice water as I was trying to eat my spicy tuna roll with my mouth on fire. Had to wait for a fork both times, and once was offered training chopsticks instead of the fork I asked for. Both times while not even halfway through my food and wine was asked if I was ready for the check. The second visit resulted in leaving early because I felt I was being rushed out.   The California Roll was made with chunks of the fake crab and the roll itself was very skimpy, the spicy tuna roll had an off flavor and I could not eat it. The prices are cheap during happy hour, but so are the ingredients.  Also, there were 2 to 3 girls just hanging out at the front counter by the door while there was a packed restaurant and they could have been a huge help to the servers.

I love this place! They have tasty affordable lunch specials for $5.99. The food is always fresh and delicious and the service is very friendly.The chips served with a little beans and cheese is unique & delicious.

The burgers and fries here are not too shabby. On my last visit here I ordered 3 meals, all the same, double cheesseburger w/fries & drink. There were tons of employees working when i was there, like too many. There were 4 people at the counter ( it was not busy,about 2pm on a Monday ) and there were sooooo many people in the kitchen area that I could not count ( maybe like 10 ) and then there were tons in the dining area ( some were eating and others were cleaning ). Anyway, when we got our food all of the burgers were made very sloppy, and one of the burgers was missing the other burger patty. When I went to the front it took forever to be acknowledged by someone, they were all running around like they were lost. I made eye contact with the manager several times while waiting and she said nada. Finally got it taken care of...when the girl brought the new burger it was not a new one, they just added the patty to the burger with 2 bites taken out of it and the girl said "if anything else is wrong let us know" in a not very friendly tone.  Note: This place did open not too long ago and this may be the reason for so many employees being there, like maybe there was some training going on. However, after observing the manager while eating I noticed that she did not have a grip on handling the chaos and it made for an unpleasant dining experience. I may try going back in a few months to see if things have improved.

Get down here and try these nachos folks, you will not be disappointed. They make from scratch their cheese sauce, and it could not be more perfect. I wish I had pics to show you, but every time I get them I just have to dive in right away.   My personal favorite is the colorado beef nachos, the meat is simmered for 6 hours in spices and is sooooo tender. They have very unique choices here you will not find anywhere, and also have vegetarian nachos that I have heard are just as good.  I have been here about 5 times now and have found myself craving this place every weekend, run to this place, you will be so happy : )

This place was really good and very affordable. I love that I can make my own roll because I am super picky and they have lots choices too. The place was very clean and service was friendly and fast. I will be back here for sure when I have a craving for sushi.

I have never been here before and wanted to check it out. We walked in and the place was absolutely filthy. Every table that we walked up to was dirty...not just a little...i mean there was trash on the tables, ketchup, drinks spilled on the floor. It looked like there was a food fight.    There were about 5 employees behind the counter playing around and when I asked if someone could please clean a table I was told that there should be a clean one somewhere.  Ok...see ya !!

Was sick for 2 days after eating their polish dog. Upon further research of this place I have learned they got a "D" on their last inspection. Gross. Will not be back.

I have been here once to get an oil change ( $19.95 ) and came back to get a coolant flush and another oil change. The coolant flush was normally $79.99, but I had a coupon for $20 off of services over $100. Even without the coupon this is a good price for this area. I drove around to get prices from about 5 other places and this was the cheapest and the fastest.  The employees were all very nice and helpful and they didn't give any bullshit ( which happens a lot when you are a woman ). I will be returning here and would highly recommend them for you too.  This place is on the corner of Litchfield & Yuma, the map on here is not accurate, at least not when I wrote this review : )

I've been here many times in their other location and always enjoyed the food and service. I brought a friend from out of town after bragging about their food. I ordered the balsamic blue cheese burger cooked medium ... My burger was awful. The meat was very red and mushy and the bun was a struggle to even bite into. I was going to send it back but my friend insisted I just try and eat it. So I tried, but it was just too raw. Our server was great and said she would ask them to fix it. Seemed like they just stuck the burger patty in the microwave and put it back on the bun which made it even worse. The fries I used to love so much were not hot and not quite cooked long enough.   My friend got the baja tacos and said everything was ok except the tortillas seemed like they were not warmed up and easily broke apart when picking them up to take a bite, and ended up just eating the filling.   I'm not sure if I'd go back for anything but drinks.

I have been to their location several times for breakfast in Prescott and really enjoyed the food and service. I came to this location to have lunch and decided on a cheeseburger and fries. I asked for the burger to have no veggies and add mayo. The burger arrived no cheese, and no mayo. I waited a long time before the server to come back. When I told her the issue, she said nothing, walked away, and then came back with a plate with a slice of swiss cheese and a side of mayo. No apology or anything, and by this time my burger was not even warm and the cheese didn't get to melt like I would have liked. The burger was a good size and looked good, but there was no flavor at all. About 3 bites in the bun completely fell apart and I just gave up eating it and finished the fries, which were good. When the server came back I told her about the bun and she said I should just try it on toasted sourdough next time. I asked if she would let them know in the kitchen, but she said those are the buns they use, that's it.   Not impressed with the service here at all, and would never get a burger here again. Also, they have the same prices at this location as the one in Prescott, which is in a tourist area, and prices are usually higher...But here in Phoenix at a place like this...$12.89 for nachos and $2 extra for any kind of meat, $14.89....A BLT $11...All salads $13.99....Come on...that's crazy!!

The employees here were all very friendly and I received my meal very quickly, which I do appreciate. I ordered the extra long fish sandwich, fries, and a cheeseburger. The fish sandwich was overcooked, the bread and the fish were very dark brown and had a burnt taste to it, and I could not eat it. The fries were nice and hot but way too salty. The cheeseburger was ok, but they put the cheese on the bottom, I tried eating it upside down but it just wasn't the same.

So I came in here to get the 5 for $4 deal for myself and my grandson. The burgers once again had the cheese on the bottom and the buns toasted all to hell! The manager came around and asked how the bacon cheeseburgers were. I asked why the cheese was on the bottom and was told this was his idea! He said he has the employees do that because the cheese won't melt everywhere like when its put on top..HUH??? I showed him my burger where about an inch of the cheese was hanging off the side, and he then says he has them put the cheese on the bread first so they don't forget it, lol! I let him know that is not the way to build a burger and he said he disagrees. I also let him know that his buns are coming out way too brown, I was informed I am wrong and they are coming as they should. NO CHEESE ON THE BOTTOM, STOP THIS MADNESS.

I had a great time here on my birthday. It was our first time here and the waitress took time to go over some of her favs on the menu. When she was told it was my birthday she said that I can get a free drink (alcoholic) of my choice...awesome!! She suggested a grape martini and it was soooo good. I had three of them. All the food we had we was good. We had a burger, taquitos, and chicken nachos. The service was great from our server and I would for sure return.

I have  been going here for about a year and have had only a few bad experiences, such as rolled tacos being ice cold in the middle, too much cheeses put on all the dishes, and bad service.  The last time I went I got the fish tacos and was sick for the next 2 days. I went online to look up their health inspection and discovered they have failed the last 2 inspections for things not being at the correct temperature and some other major violations, needless to say I will not be back until this is corrected.  And for the BIG guy that works the front counter & the drive through...smile..just a little..please. You made me feel so uncomfortable when I ordered my food..I was smiling and asking how your day was and you looked right in my face and did not respond!!
