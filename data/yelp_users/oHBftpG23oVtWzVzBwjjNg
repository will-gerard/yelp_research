I've always loved Houston's because no matter which location you go to it is consistent and the service is top notch. Never do you find yourself desperately straining your neck looking for your server and I love that!   I am a huge fan of the Cheeseburger, spinach dip, veg plate, and if you like ribs there's are the best....oh I almost forgot salads, I have tried every single one and they are all Fantastic! So, if you want to get your money's worth on a great meal, great ambiance, and phenomenal service Houston's is your place!

this place is great...you feel very welcomed and the instructors are very kind and choose recipes that are accessible to any cook at any level. I had a blast and the brunch class recipes were amazing.

Authentic French cafe...total hidden gem! The ratatouille with goat chews crepe was amazing as was the chocolate desert crepe.

I had a really wonderful experience here. My waxing specialist was very sweet and the hard wax they use is great. For those of you who don't know what hard wax is, it is a wax that when placed on the skin hardens and they do not use a strip to remove it they are able just to rip the hardened wax off the skin...what this means for you, no sticky gross residue and a quick, sanitary, less painful wax.  Bottom line: Its very sanitary, the wax is less painful and gives less ingrown hairs, and they can usually get you in on short notice...plus with all their promotional pricing what's not to like?  I am super fussy when it comes to anything beauty related and I give this place my full endorsement!

This place has a very cool vibe and I love the patio here but every time I go its completely empty. I haven't gone there for a meal but the martinis and hookah are fab! Its a great place to go and have a nice time with friends in a relaxed lounge environment.

A serious disappointment. The original Matts big breakfast is great but the airport one is nothing like it and the food is just overpriced and tasteless.

Fantastic coffee and the owners aren't too bad either. But honestly a stop worth making if you're in the area.
