(This is the first time I felt the need to voice my opinion on yelp and this being such a personal matter, I hope it is useful to future women in my shoes).....As a first time expecting mom, this office has catered to all my obscure worries and fears with care. Always making me feel at ease and answering my questions to fulfillment. I had the unpleasant event of waking up with a kidney stone at 3 a.m. To make matters worse, try typing in "contracting lower back pain, third trimester pregnancy," on the web, instant scare considering I am only 29 weeks. I  called the after hours number and my call was returned by Laura, literally within two minutes. She calmly instructed me to go down to maternal triage at my hospital. I was greeted by Dr. Thompson, who just so happened to be hanging out at the hospital at 4 am, and treated within 45 minutes of making my first call.  This experience alone makes me feel confident when I go into labor this Sept, I know I will have the support of the team as promised. That right there takes a load off my shoulders and gives me the opportunity to enjoy the last few months of pregnancy.   Furthermore, all my appointments have been pleasant and timely, their follow-up is reliable, and the staff is very friendly. Reading another review regarding the lady at the front desk... Don't let her fool you. She is a sweetheart and you will grow to like her. Not being chatty Cathy doesn't mean she isn't helpful or good at her job.   Moral of my review: They have done an excellent job handling a high-matainance, over-reacting, scared to pieces, mom-to-be. And I couldn't be more pleased.

Absolutely amazing! Pretty much take a guess and pray they are open.. Tried several different weekends and they were on siesta.  Worth the wait! The drive! Whatever sacrifice you need to make, do it.  To give you an idea of how much my honey and I love this place... I am 6 months prego with our first child, you would think he has pictures of me on his phone. Kid you not it is a picture of his burrito at Ritos!

I am going to befriend everyone that gave this place 5*'s.. Just so I know where NOT to go! Delivery was quick (thank you sir) but the hot italian beef was immensely, utterly, horribly, disgusting   no au-jus, dry as a old lady in the Arizona sun. Pass on this place. Yuck, excuse me while I hop on the treadmill in grief

I really wish I had a dagger to stab myself in the face for trying to eating here. Absolutely the WORST PLACE in the entire valley. I would turn around and go ask for my money back but I am to embarrassed to even be seen in the drive through again.   Was on my way home, thought I would give it a shot. I ordered random items; chicken taco and onion rings. The taco was like eating out of a horse trough.. It fell apart immediately and I found myself trying to shovel it into my mouth. After about two bites I realized the meat was questionably chicken. The onion rings were so blah I didn't even touch them.   Please do your self a favor.. Dig in the nearest dumpster for lunch, then go home and pound a bottle of vegetable oil. It sure beats the hell out of this joint. No joke.

The place to go if you're looking for something for an event that would make your parents disown you. Everything from hot Halloween costumes, shoes, club attire, poles, pasties, handcuffs, you name it. One stop shop for a crazy NYE party! Miaro (super sweet girl with black hair & bangs) was absolutely a doll, immensely helpful and on point. Welcoming 2015 like a walking glowstick hey-o!

I wish I could give this place 10*'s. Absolutely the first place I'd recommend for a tourist or a food snob. I've been coming here since I first moved to Arizona in 2001, and this is my go to spot. The ambiance is laid back & sexy, and the staff beyond hospitable. I just read a review from Sandy about this place, name tags and uniforms?... This isn't Denny's my dear, Welcome to class..Back to the subject on hand, I do recommend the Chicken Parma and the minestrone soup! Soooo amazing! Applausi

I LOVE this place! They offer a punch card and I think if I actually dug through my purse and car to add them up, I'd clean them out.   There are a few one-stops in the valley but this spot is for sure my favorite. The staff is fun, knowledgable & friendly (not to mention easy on the eyes ;)   I'm a creature of habit, so I always get the slimmer, almond milk, wildberry & add greens.. Soooo good! My energy level is threw the roof, I feel like I should run a quick 10k afterwards, but the whole 115* degrees outside promptly brings me back to reality.    I've bought a few vitamins & odd/ends here but can't get enough of the smoothies! I have all my friends hooked.. A must try!

Worst store, they will deny selling you alcohol if you mention that you were at a club, please keep in mind it was 10:00PM on a Saturday night even if your with someone that is sober! Completely ridiculous!!!

I've came to the realization this place somehow makes me depressed when I come here. Like a cloud comes over me and all good judgement, positive energy, patience goes, whoop, right out the window.  I had the pleasure of arguing with a girl working at 5pm 6/19, who claims they never had a roast beef sandwich and definitely not roasted peppers! I was a fool for thinking so.. I mean, it was only a staple in my routine for years, maybe I am losing my marbles?! Ok, fine... How about a BBQ chicken salad, there were less ingredients than the name itself. I found myself asking to  add so many additional items normally found in a traditional BBQ salad, it would have been easier to do it myself. Plan on extra for cheese because $9 just isn't enough to cover it. I utterly despise this place. Done & done with your food & crusty staff members!

I really, really tried to like this place but it's just not consistent. This morning was the straw that broke the camels back... Let me paint you a picture.   It's 6 am, your two year old woke up hungry and, you'll never guess, demanding. Buzzberry is a quick option. You order oatmeal for the boy & soy latte for you, but make a point to have it CHILDS HOT. Both come out steaming like it was cooked in a crematory. After 5 minutes of blowing on it, you ask for ice. 6 ice cubes later you assume it's ok. Your little one tries it and all hell breaks lose; oatmeal spit everywhere, crying, screaming, trying to do everything to keep it from burning his tongue. (Keep in mind you did test it but underneath was still hot.) Frustrated, you ask for a bag and voice the fact nothing was what you specifically asked for... You get a blank look. Not we'll fix it or I'm sorry. So, your kids bent out of shape in tears & your $6 latte is watered down in ice with generic sugar... Awesome start of the day!  You only hope the look that you gave the guy who said "have a good day" as leaving will haunt him in his sleep.   Now that being said, there are two pleasant girls that work drive-thru mid day. I appreciate their genuine hospitality. One is a younger brunette & a blonde (I really need to work on my name remembering skills)   Don't recommend the shakes, go to one-stop nutrition Do recommend the coffee cake or blueberry muffins. But sad to say I'll never be back.

DON'T go here! Use a pay phone or a library computer if you're desperate! F**ed me over. $274 to replace my iPhone 5 screen, only for it to go blank 2 days later. Thank god for Siri. Took it to apple, told me it wasn't even a verified apple product and they are taking the false claim to corporate. The boys that work there are kind but under false intentions. Tried to resolve it with them and response; (ha!) we'll fix it again, and we just dropped the price to $170! So $344 and I can have another crappy phone.

Unfortunately, I'm one of those wait as long as possible for a haircut/ color, it's embarrassing, kind of girls, so my recent trip to Flict was very much needed!  I thought I had given up looking for a new colorist, as my girl moved back to Cali, but low and behold fate saw me through.    Flict is an adorable salon that is super easy to find and has a great atmosphere. When you call and make an appointment you will find yourself smiling after you hang up the phone.. The lady who answers is extremely pleasant and the chap from london makes you wish he offered a wake up call service.  But, in the end it was Dane who was my saving grace. My hair was awful going in.. kinda did the walk of shame meeting him... but looked and felt terrific leaving.  No rush, listened, offered advise, and kept me entertained the whole time. Highly recommended.  And I feel silly writing this but I am horrible with names, I'm almost positive his name was Dane, in case I stand corrected, he is tall, handsome, and just fantastic! (in case he reads this I'm pretty sure that remark will save my butt for the name thing if I am wrong, yes? No hard feelings big D? :)   So from setting the appointment -to driving home, this was a 5.

What a gem & a hell of a find! I NEVER eat seafood in Arizona, unless a little black dress and a multi-hundred dollar tab is in order, I just don't trust it. Today however, I probably could have eaten 10 lbs of shrimp pad Thai! Amazing! I'm not sure if it was the sweetest waitress, cute & immensely kind owner, or the cleanliness of the restaurant...this spot totally caught us off guard.   I thought I was a tough cookie, "I'll take it Thai hot"... I literally spent the whole time eating as fast as I could and before it registered my mouth might as well been engulfed in flames. So, just a warning. The cashew chicken was the best I've ever had. And oddest thing to complement; the rice?!? Something about it, perfection.   As a thai connoisseur, this is my new go-to spot!

Pros: All around phenomenal at what she does. Genuinely kind and hospitable. Wine for mom while getting highlights, beer for dad for being patient. On another appointment, she rocked our son's haircut, great with kiddo's.  Cons: Broncos fanatic ;)
