Everything about Coronado Cafe is charming and scrumptious.  It's my go-to place when I want to have a nice, but not fussy, lunch with a friend.  The menu has a lot of variety but not so much that it's overwhelming.  I've never been disappointed by the food.  The raspberry iced tea is delicious too! I like that they don't have any fried food, though my male friends don't so much appreciate that as they prefer fries with their burgers.    Conversations can be challenging when dining inside-- the acoustics in an old house aren't the best to begin with, and then you cram it full of people and it gets a little noisy.  If you can't tune it out, the patio is a really lovely alternative.   All in all, you really can't go wrong here!

Although I've practiced other forms of yoga for years and years I never tried Bikram until I took a leap of faith via Groupon and committed myself to a month of classes at Bikram Yoga Phoenix.  When I stepped in to the studio it was very obviously unlike any yoga studio I'd been to.  The place is wall-to-wall carpet (gross), even in the practice room (triple gross), and the decor leaves something to be desired.  Determined to live up to my "I'll Try Anything Once" mantra, I sucked it up, kicked my sandals aside and made my way into the practice room after a brief tour from the very pleasant desk attendant.  It was an awesome, life-changing experience!    If you're familiar with the world of yoga at all you know that Bikram gets a little bit of a bad rap for some of its rules and techniques.  My perception was that it was very strict, which I suppose it is in some ways, but the instructors quickly dispelled the myth.  I had this image in my head of this super svelte instructor slapping me with a ruler to deepen my experience in trikonasana. This is not at all accurate.  The instructors here are all so genuine,  understanding, helpful (not corrective or punishing as I'd thought) and I always feel like I'm doing a great job, even if I'm not really.    The classes are so peaceful and meditative but also physically and mentally challenging.  I find myself relaxed and happy in class and I know a lot of that is due to the instructors and how wonderful they are.  While I'm sure some of the euphoria I felt during the class was due to the 5000 degree temperature, there is something to be said for the collective energy of the other students and the instructors that makes it so amazing.  As other Yelpers have noted, the smell is something wicked but you get used to it once you start moving around. Take one class and you'll understand the smell and how it is seriously unavoidable! You can't really mark them down for that, it's just the way it is.    One word of warning if you're new to Bikram.  I made the unfortunate error of signing up for the Silent Bikram Yoga class as my first.  To me, "silent" meant there was no music but I couldn't have been more wrong! SILENT means there's no instruction.  So there I was, slipping around in my own sweat trying to keep my eye on the other students so I could keep up.  Thankfully I've done so much yoga that I knew the poses, I just didn't know the sequence.  Learn from my mistake: do not take the silent class as your first.  All-in-all, this is a great studio to try out Bikram.  The people are very helpful, the environment is friendly, location is perfect, and they offer lots of classes at times that can accommodate anyone's schedule.  Give it a whirl, if for no other reason than it's the only thing you can do in Phoenix in the summer that makes the weather outside seem "cold."

I went in to Ide Mania for the first time the other day just to pick up some Aveda products.  Typically I buy them online because I can't stand the staff at Aveda salons, especially at Scottsdale.  The facade of this salon is misleading-- inside is absolutely beautiful! The staff were extremely helpful and kind, and they gave me lots of suggestions and pointers on styling.  Most of all, they were so non-judgmental and I really appreciate that.  I will definitely be buying my Aveda products here from now on!

You could sit down and watch all three Lord of the Rings movies in the time it takes to make it to the valet stand, but your patience will pay off.  Postino has a great selection of wine and the epic bruschetta menu is fitting of the parking experience-- long, complicated, and worth the wait.  I deducted a star because I find that the selection of other food lacks variety.  For example, they offer many salads that are terribly similar.  Yes, I know there are only so many variations on a salad but these just all blend together and become forgettable.  If you're going for wine and cheese and bruschetta, you won't be disappointed.  My precious!

Stupid: wanting my nose pierced since I was like 13 years old and putting it off because I was afraid of how bad it would hurt.  Stupider: getting five holes in each ear, but not taking the plunge on the nose.  Stupidest: finally getting the nerve to do it at the ripe age of 29, only to find out it was less painful than getting my eyebrows waxed.  My husband came with me the night I finally said f-it and spontaneously drove up the street to Halo to have my teen girl wish come true.  My previous experiences with piercing were at a doctor's office (where my mom took me as a kid), Claire's (gasp!) and of course the Do-It-Yourself Piercing Studio of my college dorm bathroom.  I had no idea what to expect out of a legit piercing place.  Halo impressed me from start to finish, so much so that I'm trying to think of other piercings to get just so I can go back there.    Ana did my piercing and her professionalism was beyond outstanding.  She explained everything very thoroughly, from the sanitation processes they use to after-care and everything in between.  I felt very comfortable with her and confident in her abilities.  Unlike the 20-something piercing gun wielding chick at Claire's or my own unsteady hand, Ana has expertise, skill, and passion for her work.  If you want it done right, go to Ana.  This place is spotlessly clean.  You watch them wipe down the chair you sit in.  They give you the marker they use to mark where your piercing will go because they won't re-use them.    There is a lot of jewelry there, but I like very simple jewelry so I didn't really explore it that much.  I love the diamond and white gold piece for my nose and pretty much never take it out.  The only thing I would offer as a criticism is it takes way too long to do anything there.  It took forever to get my nose done.  I don't want to rush the process and compromise on cleanliness or quality, but there were little things like the checkout process that I thought could be sped up.  I had the same experience when I went with my husband to get his ears done, and then also when I had to go to replace my nose stud because I lost mine after a night of drunken debauchery.  I guess the thing is, don't go in thinking you're just going to get something done and then head home.  It's like the nail salon.  You're gonna have to spend some time there if you want it done right.  Now that I write this review I've reaalllly got the itch for a new piercing...

This is THE place for gifts for the girl in your life with unique taste.  You're guaranteed to find something that can't be picked up just anywhere, and they'll wrap it for you in charming little papers.  I love shopping the displays at Frances-- the merchandising there is so creative that shopping is like a archaeological dig.  Look closer, look up, look around, and you find something you may have missed at first glance.  This is how a "quick trip to get a gift" ends up as an epic shopping experience.    My gripes with Frances are minimal.  One, some of the merchandise is highly overpriced.  I've found the exact same items online for much, much less (I remember a necklace in particular that was marked up to a ridiculously high price), but I do like to support local businesses so I typically don't fuss over it too much.  Two, the women's clothing is not for women but rather it is for bipedal sticks.  Perhaps these are actual mammals, perhaps they are shaped similarly to humans, I'm not sure.  All I can say for certain is they do not have derrieres or chests of any variety.  So I just don't buy any premium priced clothing there, I'll get over it.   Frances truly is a gem in the otherwise rough and disappointing retail landscape of Central Phoenix.  Don't miss it!

Burn-outs and hippies bring pizza and sandwiches right to your door! (I am fortunate enough to live near this location).  At first it was annoying that I would place the order online with explicit instructions for where my apartment was located only to find that the hippie delivery guy from Z would call my cell phone (sometimes I'd hear it ring and sometimes not) for further information.  Hijinx invariably ensue as I verbally administer the same instructions over the phone.  Now I just come to expect that when I order delivery from Z Pizza the guy who brings it to me will have blazed one up in the car on the half mile ride over to my place and will need some help getting to the door.  And then, the order surprise! Until they fixed the online ordering system you truly never knew what would actually be in your custom calzone.  Now it's at least got the right ingredients, although they interpret them a little loosely sometimes (last night, for example, I requested sauce, sauce, and more sauce and they gave me only one tiny cup).   I love the calzone with wheat crust (I love that you can get wheat at all), the turkey sandwich with cranberry, and my husband loves the Santa Fe pizza (which I personally find a little revolting).  The food is tasty and they bring it to my house.  I like that.  It's better than ordering from Pizza Megalopolis or some other insanely corporatized chain.  Even though Z is a chain they "keep it real" and operate like a mom and pop.  Plus they keep our local Granola Crowd employed so they can turn around and spend their cash at other local spots.    Gotta love the Z.

Stay away from this place!  A little over a year ago I was robbed at gunpoint at this establishment and learned they do not have functional surveillance video.  The attendant did nothing to help me after the incident and didn't even phone the police! I haven't been back there since and encourage you all to avoid it as well.  It is unsafe and not  properly monitored by the management or the employees.

The sushi here is some of the best I've had in Phoenix.  I was a fiercely loyal patron of Zen 32 until it closed, and while Hana isn't as upscale as Zen 32 was, I think the food speaks for itself.  The fish was fresh and lovely and the squid salad was probably the best I've ever had.  I thought it was odd that the edamame was served cold, but everything else was on point.    Hana is super small and it is easy to feel crammed like sardines in there.  I like that it's BYOB because it cuts down on the bill.  The service was spectacular and prompt even on a very busy Saturday night.    I totally recommend Hana for a casual sushi experience.  Excellent food and service.

The Thai Basil on Central is my favorite midtown Thai restaurant.  Super fast service and friendly staff are just the start. The curry here is amazing, though my husband and I agree they are usually skimp on some of the ingredients like potatoes.  I usually can't get my curry as spicy as I ask for (either I'm becoming desensitized or "Thai Hot" doesn't mean hot at all here) but that's really the end of my complaints.  If you want a fast, hot meal that's flavorful, Thai Basil is your joint.

After about a year of hype from friends and neighbors, we gave Maizie's a try about a month ago.  It was a weeknight and we took advantage of some great happy hour pricing on cocktails and appetizers.  The service was slow and the hummus was positively dry and awful, but the entrees were absolutely irresistible.  I liked that you could choose from half a dozen different types of bread for your sandwich-- it made for a lengthy ordering process.  I went again for brunch a few weekends ago with some of my friends.  The atmosphere was lovely and my mimosa was just $3.  The waitstaff were attentive and don't appear to have spit in my drink when we  had to send our coffee cups back because they were covered in schmutz.  I had the breakfast burrito.  Let me tell you, I lived in New Mexico (the home of the most amazing breakfast burritos) for seven years and this big burrito gave any New Mexican burrito a run for its money.    Because I understand that no one is perfect all the time, I'm a Maizie's fan for life.  I just won't ever, ever, EVER get the hummus again.  :-)

When I first moved to the Valley in 2005 I struggled to find a yoga studio that met my needs.  After many years of being forced to take yoga at corporate gyms, health clubs, and elitist studios, I was thrilled and elated to find Urban Yoga a convenient half mile away from my home.  The first day I set foot at Urban I felt so welcomed, and the instructor took so much personal interest in my to help grow my yoga practice.  I took two classes in a row that day (which is just about one year ago to the day) and have taken hundreds of classes there since.  I even signed up for teacher training at Urban and am now certified to teach.    Urban is like a home to me-- the community atmosphere at Urban cannot be matched by any other yoga studio.  These folks really care about their customers and the focus is 100% on the practice of yoga-- not about what clothes you're wearing (though the boutique there is very cute) or how hot your bod is.  You can be yourself at Urban and you will make friends.  Central Phoenix is budding with yoga studios now but don't be fooled.  Urban is the real deal.  It's beautiful studio filled with wonderful people and I highly recommend it over any others.    Namaste!

This is far and away the best nail salon I've been to in the Valley.  It's clean, modern, and tastefully decorated.  I've never had to wait for service and that is SO important to me.  The employees are really friendly and they understand if you just want to enjoy your treatments without chatting.  They give you water, and if you drink it all they give you more!   I've been extremely impressed with the quality of the services.  My gel manicures last at least three weeks if not more! I've had to go to a couple other places to get my manicure done when I couldn't get to this salon and those didn't last nearly as long. I definitely get my money's worth here.  As others have said, the fact that they do your mani and pedi at the same time is awesome.  I hate spending hours at the nail salon and this place is really respectful of your time.    The only negative thing I can say is that at least once an employee doing my manicure answered his cell phone during my service.  Other employees have their ringer on and have to silence it during service.  In a world where many businesses ask customers to turn off their phones at their stores it seems pretty inappropriate for employees in a service industry to be answering their phones and having the ringers on.  That's really my only gripe.  All in all, I really love this place and recommend it to everyone!

This is a great nail salon with friendly, personable staff and very high quality work for a very reasonable price.  They give the best and longest leg massages and they also give you shoulder massages with your manicure! I've been coming here for years and have never had any issues or complaints.  The only negative about it is that you always have to wait a really, really long time to be seen.  Solution? Call and make an appointment.  Simple as that, problem solved.

I admit it: I'm a studio-hopper.  Metta Yoga hadn't popped up on my radar until my favorite teacher started leading some classes there, so I went to her class this weekend.  Of course I loved her class (she's my favorite teacher!) so my review is about the studio in general.  Metta is such a calm, peaceful, no-fuss studio.  That's what I like! The people are lovely.  You'd think that this kind of description is true of all yoga studios but such is not the case.    My only negative is the layout of the studio.  The bathroom is in the back so you have to walk through the studio to use it, which means if there's a class going on you'll just have to cross your legs and hold it.  It's also very narrow so sometimes getting more people in class can be awkward.  But really this isn't much to be complaining about!

Throw the word "tiki" into any phrase and you've got a party.  No exception here.  Hula's has perfected the art of combining meat with fruit/sweets (love the coconut shrimp rolls) and those Hawaiian inspired cocktails that knock you on your butt.  Want a drink that's on fire? No need to head to Springfield for a Flaming Moe, you can order a cocktail here that literally comes in a flaming bowl.    The atmosphere is fun and the place is bright and cheerful in the day and dim and cozy at night.  The service is always excellent.  Or maybe that's just what you think after a couple of their drinks...   It's a great little spot, definitely worth your time to check it out!

What is the meaning of life?   Windsor.  With its sophisticated comfort food (gourmet mac & cheese, delectable chicken salad, and of course the infamous porkwich), amazing atmosphere, thoughtful decor, okay and the booze too, Windsor is where the Earth ends and the great infinite beyond begins.  It is where mere mortals can fuel up with the bread and wine of the Gods and experience greatness, if only for happy hour.  This place doesn't take itself too seriously.  The waitstaff have been carefully tested and selected to be the chillest, most zen people on this side of the great infinite beyond.  Nothing is a big deal.  You're gonna eat, you're gonna drink, you're gonna be merry.  No one is too cool or not cool enough, yet the place is ripped from the pages of the Awesomeness Times.    One of my most favorite details about Windsor? Tucked away with the packets of sugar and Splenda you'll find cute little papers printed with an invitation to dispose of your gum in it.  There's really nothing they haven't thought of, to include having purse stands at the ready so you don't have to sit in front of your bag or drape it over the chair arm.  Details.    The answer to any question is always Windsor.  Try it.

I work out a lot-- A LOT-- and with that comes the inevitable boredom and frustration associated with a routine.  I'm always on the lookout for ways to diversify my workout lineup and last December I learned about Pure Barre and decided to give it a try.    Despite my supposed workout prowess, I really had no idea what I was doing during my first class, and it hurt like crazy, but I was instantly hooked.  It was fun! Painful, but fun! I hadn't enjoyed a workout like that in years!  So I have to echo other reviewer's assessment that Pure Barre is highly addictive.  I've been going to classes nonstop since I started.  The promised results are absolutely true, as long as you stick with it of course.    The 60 minute classes breeze by as you quickly move from working one muscle group to another.  The music is energizing and addictive, and I never find myself saying "I can't wait for this class to be over." You tap into muscles and parts of your body you didn't even know you had, and feel successful after each class.  The ladies who own the studio are so inspirational and friendly and clearly care very much about their business and their clients.  All the instructors are super nice and upbeat and I always feel welcomed and wanted there.  They all make it a point to learn and remember your name, you're not just another face! I truly just enjoy being there.  For your first class, make sure you bring socks but if you forget, they do sell socks with grippers on the bottom for about $10.  Wear tight-fitting pants (no shorts).  I'm a sweaty person so I usually bring a towel as well.  Because the classes are so popular, parking can get a little crazy so make sure you arrive early.  You can park on 42nd St. to avoid the cluster in the tiny parking lot.    I've recommended PB to all my friends, and those who have been brave enough to try it have become addicted too.  I love it!!

I don't have anything nice to say about Humble Pie other than that they serve wine.  On my first trip I went with two girlfriends, one of which was about six months pregnant at the time.  We were forced to stand and wait for a table despite the fact the place was 80% empty.  We waited a good ten minutes, for no apparent reason, before being given the privilege of being seated.  The service was abrupt and rude.  At least the food was tasty, because I had something to stop my mouth from screaming at the obnoxious locals sitting at the bar.  I was sure I'd never go back there again, but about a year later another friend suggested we pop in for a glass of wine after yoga at Sutra, the studio next door.  Big mistake.  This time, the bartender barely paid us any attention in favor of entertaining another rowdy group of very intoxicated locals at the bar.  I guess Humble Pie is the place for people to get wasted and act ridiculous on a weekday night, no thanks.

After deciding I wanted to re-style my entire house I have maxed out the usefulness of the more obvious chain home accessory stores and started researching for the more unique spots around town, which are not easy to find (sadly).  I've probably driven by this place a thousand times and it never occurred to me to go in until recently.  I'm so glad I did!   There is a great mix of old and new accessories and furnishings, lots of lamps, great cabinets, and of course as other reviewers said, the candles are amazing.  I bought two and will be going back for more.  The merchandise definitely hits the high notes of the global aesthetic without being stereotypical and I think there is something here for most everyone's decor to bring a little unique flavor to your home.    The store gave me a lot of ideas for accessories for my home so I measured out my spaces and will be going back to buy some things to put the finishing touches on my rooms! Global Home is definitely a diamond in the rough and I highly recommend it!

It's so exciting to have a locally-owned specialty store like this in Glendale! Before Tortoise & Hare opened you'd have to drive to Phoenix to shop for specialty running/fitness gear, or suffer through the impersonal service of the chain sporting goods stores in the West Valley.  Those days are finally over!   Whether you're looking to start running or if you're an old pro, you'd be hard pressed to find a better place to help you get the advice and equipment you need to run safely and perform your best.  The owners take their time to explain the benefits and features of the wide variety of shoes they carry and help you find the shoe best suited to your body, stride, and type of running (trail, road, etc.).  They also offer advice on injury prevention which is important to know about especially if you're a beginner.  Customer service here definitely exceeds expectations and I felt valued the moment I walked in the door.  I felt comfortable asking for more information about some of the products they carry (usually I don't want to ask out of fear of sounding stupid) and they happily demonstrated how to use the trigger point rollers and balls.  I ended up buying one and it's now my favorite post-run treatment! I don't know how I lived without it, and I never would have known about it if I hadn't been to this store.    They carry a lot of high quality running / active clothes and equipment you don't see everywhere else.  It's nice to see some different brands and styles available! I think we're all more than a little tired of stuff like Nike and lululemon and this store has some truly unique apparel to expand your wardrobe.  I highly recommend Tortoise and Hare Sports!

Two words: TV DINNER.  That's right, every Tuesday, pop on over to Angel's Trumpet for a massive, hearty, down-home TV dinner served on an actual compartmentalized tray filled with good old fashioned comfort food.   If that brand of gluttony isn't your thing, try any of the sandwiches and you'll be totally satisfied-- the food here is a major highlight, no question.    I'm a wine person so the place gets one demerit for the very limited (and usually not-so-tasty) wine selection.  But because it is billed as an "ale house" I can't get too picky about it.  My beer-guzzling family raves about the beer selection and the flights that let you try a little bit of everything.  If they're happy with it, it must be grand!    The atmosphere is my favorite thing about the place.  The lighting is perfect, it's spacious but cozy, and there are a variety of seating options including a great outdoor space.  It's great for small gatherings and large happy hour outings alike.     A few words of advice:  1.  TV dinners start at 6pm and they are limited quantity so don't expect to show up for a late dinner and nab one-- they'll be sold out!  2.  ATAH is closed on Mondays!   3.  They don't open until 3pm Tuesday-Thursday so don't expect to grab lunch or an early happy hour during the week.    Cheers!

Tammie Coe has the tastiest cupcakes, bread, and pastries this side of the Mississip, no doubt, but I have a serious bone to pick with the business practice which seems to be one catered to the convenience of the business rather than customer satisfaction.  I popped in to the Tammie Coe on Roosevelt in mid December to order one of their standard cakes for my birthday that week.  I'd already checked the website for any information on holiday issues and none were posted.  After going through the trouble of collecting my personal information and which kind and size of cake I wanted the clerk informed me that the only type of fondant available during December is red, green, and white for the holiday.  "This is for my birthday cake and I'd really prefer the standard pink and white polka dot fondant that you always have," I said.    "We don't have it because it is the holiday."  "Do you realize people celebrate other things in December besides Christmas?" I asked.  No answer.  I realize it's not her fault, and it is the peril of the December birthday to have everything doused in red, green, and white, but I couldn't believe it was impossible to get a non-Christmas cake.  As it turns out, the standard cakes listed on the website are not standard in December, and if you want what is normally offered the other 11 months out of the year it's a "special order" in December.  After about ten minutes of half-assed solutions (including slathering the entire cake in sprinkles instead of fondant) I said never mind.  Then I went to AJ's and ordered a cake that cost half the price, was just as delicious, and not holiday themed.   Shame on Tammie.  I'm massively disappointed.

Joy for Joyride! I'm obsessed with the food, especially the "standard" taco, which is really sort of a misnomer because there is nothing basic about it.  It's flavorful and divine! Nothing here is greasy or overdone-- the food is fresh and light but very, very tasty.  I also love the carnitas taco, and the cheese dip appetizer is to die for.  It's topped with fresh jalapenos, other peppers, and tomatoes/ onions.  Soooooo yummy.    The atmosphere is casual, fun, and very social.  I also love that it's a Mexican joint but they play great indie tunes.  No mariachi! My only complaint about the layout is the seating in the lounge patio where you wait for your table.  There are these little poof seats that put your arse right at the same height as the table and they're uncomfortable.  Yes, this is a very picky little thing but I'm trying to keep myself honest and not just give an all-glowing review.  If you love fresh and light Mexican food, give Joyride a try!
