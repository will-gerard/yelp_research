I went to exchange a Chi blow dryer I'd received as a gift for Christmas for another color.  Instead of giving me a gift card with store credit for the gift return (like I asked, and it was quite obvious assuming the gift receipt I brought with me), the associate put the money back on the person's credit card who bought me the gift!Now I am left with no blow dryer. It's not the easiest conversation to ask someone for $100 for the gift they bought you that you were trying to exchange. The manager was not friendly in the slightest and gave me only one option: call customer service.  I am never going back.

Wow. So good. Can't believe I hadn't eaten here sooner. The flourless chocolate cake was one of the best desserts I've ever had. Awesome patio. The Vodka Penne was amazing too.

I got a mushroom and I believe green chili omelette. What they did was cook up some egg whites, then pour a can of mushrooms in the middle along with the mushroom juice/water from the can. It was one of the grossest breakfast experiences of my life. I will never go back.

This is my favorite food. I love the Chicken Panang Curry as well as the Cashew Chicken. Reasonably priced. Super convenient carry-out.

I'm not sure how they make their potatoes, but they are amazing. Everything we got was delicious.

Oh man. So good! I got the pulled pork sandwich with macaroni and cheese and onion tanglers. Can't wait to go back. I'm not even obsessed with bbq, but now I can't stop thinking about it.

Such a great experience! Charles was very friendly and gentle. The salon is very nice and clean. I'd had injections once before, but this experience definitely outweighed the first. I'll be going back when it's time for fillers again. I also got an appointment at my first requested time, which was extremely convenient.
