Had a large gathering here last night between two different companies. Staff blocked off the area and put signs up indicating it was a private party. Food was warm and drink service was great. Seemed like there was always a server ready to refill drinks. In fact, they had several servers assigned to our group, which was great. Music wasn't super loud and lights dimmed as night hit.  Good experience, no complaints

I've had great experiences over the years with Tek. I had a contract through them for a year about 8 years ago and then recently worked with them when it was time for a new position. They ended up not being my final selection but had a good experience with them regardless.  I will say they are way more legit than a lot of the "email recruiters" that appear to be popping up. You can actually visit their office and meet the staff. The recruiters are actually in town and follow up regularly...it's a company you can build a relationship and they actually work to find you your next role if you are a contractor. They are probably 4 stars as an overall company, but in the recruiting world they are certainly 5 compared to some of the bozos I've worked with.  Benefits-wise, I can't speak for current prices but we did use them for medical 8 years ago. It sure beat Cobra, but that market has changed so much I have no idea what it is now. But they are big enough that they offer a full online training catalog and actually are willing to invest in their contractors from a knowledge and career standpoint. My favorite recruiter, Trent, is no longer with them, but Sam was a great guy this time around and I'll certainly stay in touch with him for when this contract runs out. He is young, but he's very eager and really wants to do well.  My one tip to them is this: up the communication a bit. I was looking for a job during the holidays which is a HORRIBLE time to be searching (nobody wants to hire) and I didn't hear from them for a couple weeks. Which honestly is because of people's vacations and there being nothing out there. In fairness, I was in the middle of interviews for another hot lead and they knew that, so maybe they were waiting to see what happened. But a call every few days even if there's no update would go a long way to reduce the anxiety of job hunting.

We have been buying from B & B Appliance for well over 10 years (2 locations ago, I think!). We've bought appliances for ourselves and appliances for a couple rental houses we own. We usually buy the new/scratch/dent versions, but recently needed to save some money. We bought a full set of appliances (micro, range, fridge, and DW) for a rental property and went ahead and bought a used DW to replace our own broken one.   We have always had a great experience with B&B so didn't think twice about a used DW. However, upon getting the DW home we learned it didn't work. Despite water being on, the dishwasher would not flow water. We called them and were told "Since you took it home, you need to bring it back".   If this was where the story ended, we'd be looking at 2 stars. Our first experience with warranty/service and that's it? But my wife decided to call back and talk to the salesman who sold them to us and he quickly corrected the bad call by the other guy. He explained that warranty service normally has that policy, but this is different because it never worked to begin with. They sent a tech all the way out to us in Mesa who realized they had messed up on the refurb (that, or a part came lose during transit?). We were already heading back there to pick up other appliances so we said we could bring it in. They fixed it and tested it in the shop while we waited, and even went to their yard and replaced the front panel that had a stain we hadn't been able to get off. Then they polished it up before giving it back to us while at the same time giving us a great deal on a double oven my wife had been eyeing. Been working perfect for a couple weeks now and was half the price of the big box stores.  One note: the double oven we bought on the second trip seems to reset its clock every once in a while when igniting a burner. Tells me there's a little short somewhere so I'm not completely satisfied and am cautiously watching it for a pattern...  All in all, they handled it well. Previous experience had all been 5 stars but it was a little frustrating dealing with a dishwasher that never worked. 4 stars, still great and will use again, just being cautiously optimistic.

We were forced to use East Mesa Animal Hospital about 6-8 months ago due to a weekend emergency when our regular vet was closed.  Our lab was attacked by a stray pitbull and had some lacerations that needed treated.    First, the staff of the facility was really great...front desk was good and the assistants were great.  However, the older vet was very short with me, not friendly, and very rude with her own staff.  She was issuing commands, pushy with them, and very demeaning.  I honestly don't know how the girls who work there put up with it...they seemed so sweet and just kind of shrugged it off.  Maybe she was having a bad day, but I was very unimpressed.    As far as the facility, from our room we could see at least one of the vet's offices and it was piled high with books and papers...like crazy, hoarder high.  The facility is dated too, which by itself I'm willing to overlook, but combined with my experience confirms I will NOT be going back.  Would give it 1 star, but the treatment did at least work to put off infection, so I guess they have that going for them.

I've had a 5 star experience and a 3 star experience with this place. But I'm going to try it again this week to see if it was a fluke as my neighbor also had a 5 star experience.  The 5 star was great, so I'll talk about the 3 star visit. We were selling our Honda Odyssey minivan so we had it detailed. Got it back and it looked great! But within 24 hours it started to smell. By the second day it was smelling REAL bad. I took it back and he did an Ozone treatment for smell for no charge. Helped a little then the smell came back again a day or two later.   By this point the new buyer was planning to pick it up and I had to figure out what was going on.  Turns out they had gotten water in a lower storage compartment in the floor during the cleaning. They must not have realized it was there because the carpet in the compartment was SOAKED. I took it out, dried it out with towels, set the carpet in the sun and stuck heaters blowing in the compartment all night. Thankfully it was all dry and the smell mostly gone by the next day. I just wish they would have figured it out and taken care of it (though he did try).  That was about 2 years ago.  I'm giving benefit of the doubt and taking a car back in this week to see what he can do and will update my review accordingly.

Pretty average. Craftsman has really gone downhill with all their tools being made overseas now.  Clerks seem discouraged at this store.  They are helpful, but just seem frustrated with not being proud of the tools they sell any more.  Frustrated with Sears as a whole, this location is pretty average.  However, there is at least one guy in tools who can actually rebuild your ratchet instead of just replace it with chinese crap if it's broken.  Granted, it gets rebuilt with chinese innerds, but at least you have your USA ratchet.  Don't let them swap out your broken US made tool with a new Chinese made one!  I really only shop in tools, though that too will soon be changing.

I wanted to love this place, and I really don't have any specific gripes...the staff was very friendly, take out service was fast, order was perfect, price was ok (seemed a little high, but reasonable I suppose).  Just didn't seem like it had much flavor.  Service was 4 stars, food was 2 stars. A 2 star rating for "Meh. I've experienced better" seems to fit. Food certainly wasn't bad...whole family ate it just fine.  Just was...unremarkable.  I usually devour leftover Chinese food, and some of this sat in the fridge and went bad because I just had zero desire to reheat it.  I feel bad about not liking it, and I really hope others do.  I'll probably try it again, just wish I'd been blown away.  Have just had too many others that were way better.

We have been coming here for years and consistently have a great experience.  We cheated on them once and went to a local shop, had a tire defect cause a blowout, and local shop did nothing about it.  Also found out they (the other shop) had used a cheap plug on another one of the tires that blew out on the freeway causing a flat tire.  Since then, we have not gone anywhere else.  Most recently, I took my son's minibike wheel in for a new air stem as the old one rotted off from age.  Rep put his gloves on, took it back to the shop, put the new stem on, and brought it back.  Less than 5 minutes and didn't even charge me.  Just said, "consider us when you need tires".  This represents my experience here over the last 10 years.    I would say specific to this location, the only downside is how busy they sometimes are...I've gone to the location on Gilbert and Baseline before simply because this shop was so backed up.

We took our dog here for years, and while we recently switched vets, I honestly have no complaints about Noe's.  The facility is always clean and doesn't smell, feels modern, and the front desk staff has always been VERY friendly.  Assistants and vets seem to care about us as customers/patients.  They used to offer very affordable boarding that we used a few times, but seems like they've gone away from that.  I didn't really ever feel a sense of loyalty to them, probably because we always saw someone different when we took our animals in.  And probably also because we typically only went in one visit a year.  But I also never felt short changed or mistreated.  It's a good vet.

Went for the first time tonight and absolutely loved it. It helped that our waitress Jeannine was fantastic.  She could tell I really wanted to try the chowder but just didn't want a full bowl.  Next time she came to our table she had two samples for me.   Drinks were good, service was just right (there when we needed, but not annoying).  Food was fantastic.  There were also little things, like how my wife and father in law split a dish and it came out already split on two plates,  or how our server packaged up the leftovers for us. Just that extra touch of class. We will definitely be returning.

First, never would have found this place if someone had not led me here. The garlic cheese bread is the best I've had and their marinara is perfect. It's a little sweeter pizza sauce, which is my preference. But the service was even better. Our waitress (Maria?) discussed the different pizzas and answered questions for us. After she'd put our order in she came back and made a suggestion for a change. She said, "I gotta be honest. You ord'd good pizzas, but I wouldn't feel right if I didn't make a suggestion. What da ya think about switching pizza [x] with pizza [y]. I think you'll just be happier. If I was a havin ya over ta my house, dis is what I'd a make for you". Her suggestion was perfect...she totally knew what she was talking about and we devoured both large pizzas. One fault was that the one person in our party who ordered a salad never received it, but she ended up eating pizza with us and never felt like it was necessary to mention it (other than to make sure we weren't charged). I will absolutely be back here and bringing friends.  3/30/16: Went back for lunch yesterday as a big group again. Same waitress served us and asked what we wanted. We told her to surprise us so she picked 3 large pizzas, each one with half of one and half of another. We devoured them and loved every selection. That girl knows how to please.

This is a regular for us, and unfortunately we're stuck in a rut and order the same thing just about every time now.  But every time we think of ordering something different we feel like we'll miss our old favorites.  The Pablo Picasso salad is simply fantastic, and I'm not really a salad person.  The Cheesy Garlic Bread makes my mouth water and the Pesto pizza with added chicken is wonderful.  Plus, it's kid-friendly, as our kids love playing with dough while waiting for our meal.  My only complaint is that the wait can be quite long.  Two days ago we were waiting for outdoor seating and despite there really not being anyone else by the front door, we still waited a good half hour.  Guess that's the nature of wanting a specific area with a decent size group (which is why no star is docked...we understand!)  We have been countless times and will continue to go, though will probably stay away on the normal busy nights.

I am not ready to say it's my favorite pizza ever but it IS very good pizza.  And their party size is HUGE.  We get this pizza for take-out regularly and choose it over the other options within about a 2 mile radius.  Sauce has good flavor, good amount of cheese, generous with the toppings, all good.  Found out last time we went in that they have cannoli's that are molto fantastico!  All in all, a great place to have around the corner.

Hon-Man literally saved me about $1,500.  The A/C went out in our Civic and after taking it to a shop and spending $150 to diagnose I was told the compressor went out, and that because of this they would need to replace all major A/C components due to metal shavings.  They quoted me over $1,600.  So I called a mechanic friend for advice and told us that some shops can flush the system and recommended Hon-Man.    I called them up and they said worst case I'd be looking at $1,200 with the full flush, but said to bring it in first because it may be significantly less.  I stopped by and Tait came out to look at it.  He spent about 5 minutes tinkering with it and told me the clutch on the compressor just needed shimmed.  He said he couldn't guarantee how long it would last, but he really thought it would fix it and if it didn't, he'd credit me toward the big repairs.  $80 later and the A/C was blowing ice cold...and has been for 8 months! (Update 1/26/2016: A/C is still going strong 2 years later)  I really appreciate a shop that is willing to actually find the underlying issue instead of just throwing parts at it.  It's refreshing to find a shop that actually cares about figuring out what's wrong instead of guessing.

This is for sales department, specifically fleet (no experience with service).  I had somewhat of non-standard request that I called them about.  My mother lives across the country and is in the process of purchasing her first car by herself.  She was very nervous about it and wanted me to look at and test drive the same car she was considering.  Only problem is I'm in Arizona.  So I called Big Two and got a hold of Rachel in Fleet.  She was super accommodating and totally understood.  We set an appointment for later in the day that I could come down and take a look.  When I arrived, I was led back to her office and she already had the exact same car waiting for me that my mother was looking at back in Indiana.  She casually and comfortably showed me the features, explained the advantages, answered my questions and then we headed on the test drive.  I LOVED that she was not pushy and seemed genuinely interested in helping me determine if the car was a good purchase for my mother, even though she knew the sale was not hers (such as asking if she needed any accommodations, lower entry, etc).    All in all I had a wonderful experience with Big Two.  I suppose anyone who walks through their door is a potential customer, but I had less potential than most and I was still treated like I mattered.  Even when I received the standard hook to purchase our current vehicle (a Toyota) it didn't seem salesy and felt more like a compliment.  Well delivered :)  They have successfully put themselves at the top of my list when I'm later in the search for a new car myself.  Thank you for the great service, helpful advice, and super comfortable sales tactics.

This will probably get lost in the number of reviews but there is a reason there are so many 5 star reviews. Not only is he the friendliest tradesman I've ever met, he knows his industry and knows how to act professionally. We had to call him to change locks on an eviction, which is never a fun experience. But arriving before us, he knew to park around the corner until we arrived and uses an unmarked van to avoid issues. Then he walked us through the process, was cordial with the tenants (who were sill moving out), and perfect in executing his job. On top of it all, he was the least expensive locksmith I have ever hired! Truly a fantastic experience.

We are extremely happy with Homestead since switching to them about 6 months ago.  Granted, I honestly didn't have a problem with the other vet we had been using, but I didn't really have a reason to be loyal either, and they tended to be kind of expensive.  A friend recommended Homestead and Dr. Hunt has been fantastic!  First, Dr. Hunt is very down to Earth.  He explains things in ways that are easy to understand and doesn't push extra services.  He never comes across as "doing it for the money".  For example, with one medicine he mixed for us, he told us to save the leftover because the ear problems are normal and the medicine will keep, then to use that before calling in for more.  Second, he cares about his patients.  I called this morning and while the phone was ringing realized they didn't open for another hour.  But then Dr. Hunt himself answered the phone, answered my questions, and even scheduled the appointment we needed.  How many doctors or vets do you know would answer the phone before hours and before all their staff was there, let alone be able to book the appointment!  All in all, Dr. Hunt is a great vet, a great business owner, and a great person.  We now have a reason to be loyal!  Small update 3/17/2015: My son's cub scout tiger den needed a "go-see-it" at a vet so my wife called Homestead.  As far as I know, they had never done this before but still gave the boys an AMAZING tour! One of the employees had her lab there and let them listen to his heart, gave a tour of the facility, and showed what they did with animals.  They boys loved it and still talk about it a month later!  Thank you Homestead for going out of your way to really make it a great experience for our tiger cubs!

I can't say enough good things about Scorpion Tech...they're fantastic!  They are friendly, they do a good job, and they are PROMPT!  They show up when they say they're going to be there, and if bug show up between treatments (we do every 3 months), they come out and do a respray for no cost.    In addition, we've referred them to our neighbors for bee and wasp problems and they do an excellent job finding nests and getting rid of the problem.  They truly are "satisfaction guaranteed"!

Came here as a last resort because my wife had something in her eye. Basically, it was a doctor who was open, close to us, and in my insurance network. You would think they would make it a priority to look at what was in her eye but we had to jump through hoops and go through a whole eye exam while they tried to verify insurance. Then, while my wife was already in tears, they decided they needed to puff high pressure air into her eyes. They finally called her back to see a doctor and after looking and not seeing anything I suggested, "can you at least put some drops in to numb her eye?" It was at this point she finally got some relief and could hold her eye open long enough for the doctor to look at it, at which point she claimed to see a scratch. But why did I have to request it? Don't expect to see us back here. And we are heading somewhere else tomorrow because we are not comfortable it was even diagnosed right.

We came here right after they opened and had a HORRIBLE experience. Horrible service, horrible food.  We had marked it off our list.  This was about 6 years ago I guess.   But a month ago the friends that were with us decided to give it a second shot and loved it.  So we tried it again tonight.  What a difference! The scallops were fresh, food was great, and service was perfect.  We will certainly be coming back as we are excited to have good seafood so close to home again.

Only found this place because my son's school orders pizza from here on Wednesdays...but what a find!  Absolutely LOVE their pizza for lunch, and have never been disappointed by their service.  They have a white pizza that with added chicken and sun dried tomatoes is heavenly!  Definitely worth the visit.

Took a little while for food but tasted great.  However, I asked if horchata refills were free and the girl said no so I said nevermind. Unknown to me, the owner or regional manager or someone happened to be standing behind me and heard. Asked for my cup and walked back and got it, said it was on him.  Nice touch, and prompted a review. Love that kind of service.

My kids and I are on a hunt for the best donut in the East Valley. It's turning out to be a challenge because donut taste appears to be quite varied. Nevertheless, we are pleased with our first visit to Bosa. I had heard they were good and confirm they are solid donuts.  Dunkin used to be our goto but since I learned they are frozen it's just not the same. So 5 stars, but too early to declare a champion.  Bosa is better than Dunkin, about equal with Darling Donuts. Let the search continue!

This place was very good until dessert. My pasta a la vodka was a perfect al dente, though my friend thought her fettuccine was a bit dry. However, come dessert we were both blown away by the tiramisu. Un-freaking-believable. I can't stop thinking about it. So much so we are planning to return this week while in town for work just for drinks and dessert.  Update 4/17: was in town for 5 days and this is my 4th trip. 3 were just for tiramisu and drinks. I will miss it.  Update 6/2/15: back in town for a day and this was my first stop. It's notable that I watched the bartender pour a shaken drink and then top it off with liquor like she was supposed to instead of ice. Nice to know you get the drink you pay for.  Update 12/5/2015: It's a sad day indeed. I no longer work for the employer who regularly flew me to Charlotte and what I will miss most about working for them is being able to come to Aria for Tiramisu. I literally almost shed a tear. Farewell, sweet Aria. If you are reading this, have a Tiramisu for me and tell them it's in memory of an old friend.

I'm reviewing it on the basis of take-out.  I love their yellow curry.  I've actually only ever ordered take-out, but have ordered 5 or 6 times now.  Every once in a while I get a hankering for it and have yet to be disappointed.    I can agree with the other reviews that the decor is not the fanciest...it could use some updating.  In fact, I probably would not take my wife here to try Thai for her first time, simply because experience is important.  However, the food is good and that's what keeps me coming back.  I'm a fan.

Let me start by saying I am a total Indian Cuisine Noob.  I have loved Indian food every time I've had it, but I usually go with Indian guys who just order for all of us.  So I was a little out of my element when I called and ordered take-out.    However, on the phone I attempted to order what I thought I wanted.  They were very helpful asking me what I had liked in the past, and based on my descriptions confirmed I was ordering the right dish.  They asked if I wanted some Nan with it, and not knowing what it was I said no.  They were surprised and asked, "No nan??" and I confirmed.  When I went to pick it up, the woman at the register said, "I think you want Nan so I included it, no charge." She was right...I should have ordered it with Nan.  Noob mistake, but they took care of it anyway.  Food was delicious and I will be returning!

We have used Safelite for years.  Before that, I made the mistake of using the companies that give you $50 in cash or restaurant coupons when you get a new windshield through insurance.  That glass must be much thinner because I always had cracks within a few months.  Not so with Safelite.  Some recent experiences: A year and a half ago I bought a classic Jeep.  Safelite not only installed it with a new seal for cheaper than anywhere else sold just the windshield (not insurance claim), but when the trim came off they came back out to fix it quickly for no charge.  I didn't have a rearview mirror at the time, but when it finally came in I just stopped in and they installed it for me in the parking lot, no charge.  Then today our rearview mirror fell off the factory OEM windshield on a different one of our cars (Arizona heat!).  My wife stopped by this location and asked if they could help and in less than 15 minutes they had the car in, the mirror mounted, and back out to my wife.  And this wasn't even their windshield!   They obviously care a lot about service and we will keep using them for any of our needs.

This is one of those things where it apparently totally depends on what tech you get. First, the pros: They were responsive, they have a weekend answering system set up which was a little odd but worked. We had a tech scheduled to come out on a Saturday within a few hours for a Rheem tankless water heater that stopped working at a rental property. That part was great. Unfortunately, that's where the greatness ended.  Tech met me at the house. First thing he did was explain it was going to be minimum $150 and probably more. Considering I needed to get hot water for my tenant, I didn't have many options.  Ran through some stuff and then said, "Hm, that's strange, there's no phone number on the heater label. I've never seen that. Do you have the owners manual?" I explained if I did it wasn't handy considering I was onsite at the rental property and we'd had the unit for several years. In my mind I was thinking it was an easy Google search, but gave him benefit of the doubt as he called the main office to have them look up a number. He then called Rheem, sat on hold for a bit, and was transferred to someone else. Finally started working with support at Rheem and they walked him through troubleshooting the system.   At this point, he pulls out his multi meter and starts touching things. I hear him say something to the tech and then hang up. He explains to me that his multi-meter stopped working and he needs to go get another one. Ok, fine. He leaves and I hang out sitting on my truck tailgate. After an hour of waiting, I finally call the main office to see what in the world is taking so long. I learn that he's like 20 minutes away in a different part of town at a "supply warehouse". For a multi-meter? After around an hour and a half he returns and explains to me that he couldn't find a multi-meter at any stores (????) and therefore couldn't finish anything today. Said something like, "I'm not going to spend $30 on a crap meter to then have to turn around and spend $100 on another." Told me he had to have someone else come back tomorrow to finish. I asked if that Rheem tech support line  would even be available tomorrow and he said, "oh, um, yeah, they should be" and then walked away.   I was very frustrated at this point. It'd been over 4 hours and nothing had been done and the tech basically walked away from it. Furthermore, I've used multi-meters for years and while I have a fancy one, I usually use the cheap ones with zero issues. Anyway, the tech left after an entire wasted afternoon. I had to do something, so I took matters into my own hand. I drove half a mile down the road to an Ace hardware, bought a multi-meter for $15, came back, called the number for tech support, they walked me through troubleshooting for 5 minutes, determined what parts were bad and told me they'd overnight them with instructions for me to install them myself. AND WE DIDN'T EVEN USE THE MULTI-METER! Why on Earth couldn't the tech have done this???  Needless to say, I called the main office to cancel the appointment for the next day and vented my frustration. It was completely ridiculous. When I call a supposed "expert" in a field, I expect them to know more about the subject than me. Today, that was not the case.

I was working on a laptop for a friend about 3 years ago and was at a loss as to the issue with the screen. AZ Laptop Pros spent a good 30 minutes troubleshooting with me, trying different screens cables, etc. Unfortunately, they ultimately did not have the part I needed but they did not charge me a dime for the time spent working with me. They suggested another shop down the street for the part. That shop didn't have the part and told me, "As soon as we touch your computer it's a $49 service fee". What a difference! I do most of my work myself, but when I need friendly, expert advice, there's only one place I'm going in the future: Arizona Laptop Pros. Service is absolutely unbeatable and I would have happily paid whatever the price if they'd had the part I needed. (Note: In the spirit of full disclosure, this review was also added on Google)

Sprinklers annoy me.  It's the kind of situation where you're paying $5 to replace the part and $50 to know what part to replace. In our particular situation, we had a valve that wouldn't shut off.  I figured it was something inside that was bad, but none of the big box stores I went to had parts to replace the innards...just whole valves.  There was no way I was going to spend the time to dig up the valve, cut it out, and glue in a new one.  Sprinkler Doctors found the bad valve quick and turns out it did just need a membrane replaced.  $12 part, but I admit I was a little bummed to have to pay like $65 for the labor (IIRC).  It's not out of line with similar service or anything, I just hate paying for something that I know I COULD do myself and just don't want to or can't find the right part.  That being said, the tech was very pleasant, worked quick, set the timer and checked all our sprinklers (we just bought this house a month ago).  Turns out 4 sprinklers were bad, and he said he could come back and fix them but then told my wife, "If your husband is handy, send him to xxx to get the parts for a couple bucks less, get [these brand] heads, and just screw the new heads on".  I appreciated the opportunity to fix it myself for $20 instead of paying $100 for another call and parts.  That bumped this review from 4 to 5 stars.

Extremely happy with Highline.  We had been bouncing around mechanics having some bad experiences.  Found a guy we liked, and then he quit working on cars to do some network marketing thing.  Finally found Highline and couldn't be happier!  The prices are all reasonable, they know what they are doing, and they only recommend work that really needs to be done (even telling us to hold off on some other work).  Have referred two people to them and both are equally pleased.

We continue to take all our vehicles here with wonderful results. Those we referred are equally happy. Furthermore, if we ever even hint that we aren't completely satisfied Charlie makes sure to do what's needed to leave us thrilled.  My wife trusts them, which says a lot. Charlie has even given her his personal car as a loaner when we haven't been able to arrange rides (at least, he did until he bought his sporty mid-life crisis car. Ha!). We call with questions and they take the time to walk through things with us. They don't replace stuff that's not needed.  Just an honest shop that does things right. You WILL NOT be let down.

Was referred here by a friend and loved it! The food was incredible, kind of a down home style cooking but fancied up. We absolutely loved it,  though I admit nothing on the dessert menu caught our fancy.   Service was great too.  My friend ended up not being crazy about the drink she ordered and very politely asked our server to switch. This can be a sticky situation because it all depends on restaurant policy if they will do it. But our server very graciously brought a different drink and didn't charge for the first. While I would never assume to not pay, it's very nice when they make this customary gesture. Just good service and fantastic food.

Had high hopes for this place and I HATE writing negative reviews but we just were not impressed.   We had a large group and upon arriving were offered drinks. After 3 attempts at ordering a craft beer I thought I would like and being told they didn't have anything like what I was looking for (no stout? No Belgian type ale?) I switched to Jack and Coke. Then the server said they were out of Jack and Gentleman's Jack and my only option was single barrel at $15 a drink. So finally went with a specialty drink that tasted watered down. As I started looking at the menu I learned they are a whiskey bay with like 30 types of bourbon starting at like $4. And my only option was single barrel at $15?  Came time we to order food and our waiter was nowhere to be found. After a good 10 minutes he came by and I ordered the brisket with Mac n cheese and loaded potato. Brisket was ok, not great not terrible, mac n cheese was ok but I didn't feel it lived up to the other reviews. Potato was just bland.  I wanted to like it but just didn't have a great experience all around.  Will not be going back.

I went here for some gift certificates and walked out with a pie to boot.  I simply couldn't resist.  I decided to try one of their signature pies, the Lemon Blueberry Sour Cream pie and holy smokes, it was amazing!  Served it after dinner with friends and everyone loved it.  I will definitely be returning soon.  And will go even sooner if my wife doesn't catch me.

Live right around the corner and love this place.  We usually get the take out family pack and make tacos at home but decided to eat here tonight. Food just can't be beat. Fresh ingredients cooked to perfection.

We've been looking for a good Chinese restaurant since moving to East Mesa and finally found one we were satisfied with. We've had some stinkers but Lotus Garden was definitely worth the drive.  I tend to judge Chinese restaurants initially by their sesame chicken, and when I first got home and opened the takeout box I was disappointed that it looked like dry breaded chicken.  Turns out much of the sauce had slipped to the bottom...a good stir and it was all recoated in a light sweet sauce that was excellent. My kids even had seconds! The Lo Mein with Chicken was also quite good, perhaps the best I've had.  The sweet and sour pork came dry with sauce on the side, which I'm assuming was to keep it from getting soggy. Everyone had seconds on that too!  The mongolian beef was our only disappointment. Not because it was bad, just because it wasn't what we were expected. It had a lot more kick than we expected, which I don't necessarily mind, but I just wasn't as crazy about it.  All in all, it was worth the 15-20 minute drive and we will certainly be back!

Dorine is fantastic! I've never owned a dog with long hair before and therefore have never had a dog groomed other than nails. That changed when we adopted a 6 mo Crocker Spaniel. I just took him to get his first grooming at 8 mo old and had no idea what to ask for. Dorine made me feel super comfortable as she explained options. I went with a shorter puppy cut and he looks adorable! There are no clipper marks or anything.... very smooth coat. Just couldn't be happier! He even seems to love it himself.  Ha. We will be returning.

Very happy with Justin.  Our neighbors found him and were pleased so I've since hired him several times to fix pool equipment.  It typically goes like this: I first make an attempt to fix something or replace something.  Fix leaks, lets air in the system, or doesn't work right.  I call Justin, who graciously comes out and fixes my fix.  This has been repeated several times and he still keeps me as a customer.  I've even cheated on him a couple times when he's been too booked or on vacation and I've always regretted it.  He really understands pools, their equipment, and how it all works and is able to quickly troubleshoot issues.  Some people do their trade for the paycheck and others do it because their brains just click with it.  Justin and pools go together like margaritas and a hot Phoenix day.  Highly recommend.

Had an awesome chicken parm sandwich. Took a little longer wait but at least they warned me about it on the menu.  Taste was great. Only complaint is sandwich "sloppiness"--meat and inside didn't fill the hoagie so got plain bread at finish and was unevenly toasted...burnt edge and uncooked bottom.  Now understand, I am being picky...it still tasted awesome. Good marinara, melted cheese, grated parm. Just wish it was a little more stuffed. Will definitely return though.

Take note...this is probably the most honest (and longest) review of New Results Medical Weight Loss that you will read.  First, spoiler alert: New Results does not have any magic "NR-3" pill or magic plan to make you lose weight. They don't have a patented "latest weight loss" trick and they don't have their own brand of protein bars and shakes. Their medicine and supplements have been used for dieting for 40 years. You don't see a doctor every visit, but not sure you'd want to pay for that anyway. The first visit with Brett and the weight loss team comes across as a well practiced monologue and includes a 20 minute instructional video. They talk about everything you'd expect...the really hard first days where you lose a bunch of [water] weight fast, then the longer phase 2 with slower but still real loss, and then the transition period. Kind of like every major diet book out there (see? nothing new). Brett is totally a friendly, maybe salesmany personality and gives you a great "Go get 'em!" speech to pump you up, gives you your appetite suppressants, supplements, and meal plan and sends you on your way. The only thing missing was the "this is a pound of muscle/this is a pound of fat" demonstration. You could almost buy a $10 book for the same info.  And I'm still giving it 5 stars. Why? Because Brett really does seem to care. He's passionate about this topic, and it bleeds over into his staff who are fantastic. They are honestly the most encouraging group of weight support people I have ever met (and I've met a few). And cost? How about way less than all the ones you hear on the radio. Call around and check...you'll see what I mean.  Here's the deal. I know how I lose weight...I've successfully done it in the past, on my own, without any expensive doctor visits. I've counted calories, counted points, analyzed different foods, gone caveman, low fat, high fat, tracked food and weight religiously, and seen the pounds slip off over time. I've done enough fad diets that I feel I have a pretty good understanding of calorie deficits, how my body burns, etc.   Nevertheless, I found myself now 60-70lbs overweight and the heaviest I've been in my entire life. I was borderline depressed about it and just couldn't motivate myself to get back into the pound per week habit over 8-12 months. I would get 2 days back into it and give up because it just seemed sooo looog till I'd hit my goal. I honestly felt like I had one more try in me and wanted to get it right.  This is why you go to New Results. If it's your first time trying to lose weight then they will provide tons of good education. Eye-opening education. But lets face it...most of us who are trying to lose are familiar with the drill. What I lack, what we lack, is motivation to get over the hump.   When you go to New Results, you are not buying a magic pill or special home delivery meal plan. You are buying a weight loss education and ideology that includes great coaching, accountability, and a few little tools that help smooth out the experience. This is where Brett and his staff shine. You walk in and his staff actually greets you with a smile...it's like they are genuinely happy to see you. Brett's the first to tell you that their low sugar, low carb nutrition plan is nothing new. But he does explain why it's a really great option for fast, true, healthy weight loss and helps you understand how to do it. You get tools to make it more comfortable. You get coaching and encouragement. You get motivation to not eat that free cake and ice cream at work today because you have a weigh in coming up.  No, you don't see a doctor much. But you are initially seen by a real medical doctor who is accountable for making sure it's safe for you to use the medicine, checking your heart condition, writing you the prescription, and determining how you respond to it. I have to assume that unless he wants sued he's monitoring things behind the scenes and not just writing blank checks...er, prescriptions.  Is the price a steal? No. But it's not robbery either. Like I said...call around. I found it way cheaper than every other place out there with the almost identical plan. And you are getting a doctor monitored weight loss plan.  Bottom line: The speals at first seem a little rehearsed and the whole first visit seems pretty choreographed. The medicine and techniques are nothing new. BUT...the medicine and techniques work. The staff is crazy friendly, encouraging, supportive and helpful and it sets them apart. If you follow their plan, you WILL lose weight faster than anything other than bariatric surgery. But furthermore, you will understand WHY you are losing weight and what lifestyle changes are needed to keep that skinny body. They put it in your hands, but they also give you all the tools you need to succeed. Now it's up to you...is it time? Then go visit New Results.

Ashlie is fantastic. As a guy, I typically don't like having to schedule haircuts. For years I just went to great clips or the like because I could walk in. But I gotta admit, Ashlie's confidence and comfort in cutting hair shows that she's in her element. Haircuts just come out better. I started coming because my wife comes here and loves it. I keep coming because she is so good.

We had no idea this place was even here until we were given a combined gift card to The Hub/The Vue. We'd been to the Hub so decided to try this place. I honestly thought it was just a golf course snack shack...boy was I completely wrong. Full gourmet menu with rotating items, curated wine selection (apparently) and professional staff. If you're familiar with Postino in downtown Gilbert, it's similar to that...great bruschetta, smaller (but not necessarily worse) wine selection, but with a better, more robust menu too.  We were greeted and seated when we walked in. It has kind of a 19th hole meets wine bar atmosphere, but certainly upscale enough to be a regular eatery even if you never play golf. Upon being seated, someone other than our hostess (the owner?) came out to greet us and offer us a little first visit sample appetizer (toast with some herb butter). Nothing huge, but a nice gesture. And whatever that butter was for the toast was pretty amazing.  For our meal, we tried the chicken street tacos, bruschetta, and beef stroganoff, all of which were outstanding. Similar to Postino, they offer maybe 8-10 different types of bruschetta and you get to pick up to 4 for your entree. We were talked into a lemon/banana pudding parfait for desert that was the special and it was the perfect palette refresher to end our meal.  Our little date night there was really beyond our expectations...the chef is an obvious foodie and loves what he does and the food shows it. We absolutely loved every minute and can't wait to return...maybe for their Sunday Brunch (which apparently is a whole separate menu).
