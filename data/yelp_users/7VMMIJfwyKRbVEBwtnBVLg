Absolutely fun place to hang out. Good beer. Good food...except avoid the coleslaw. They had live music when we were there. I've never been to England or Europe but I'd imagine this is what it's like. Fun people fun atmosphere fun times.

I bought a living social deal and decided to check this place out.   HOLY SHIT! Amazing place. It was my first fondue experience. The deal on living social was awesome. I got wine, apps, main course, and desert. I ended up buying a bottle of 7 deadly zins which they listed for $70. It's only $15 at bevmo, so I got suckered on that one.   The food was awesome. Our server was a good guy. He was super friendly and made the experience very enjoyable. If you're cheap or looking to pinch pennies, this is not the place to take a date. It's expensive, but I think it's worth it. The atmosphere is very nice. It's more of a fine dining experience. I had a great time and I'll be going back again.

During my kitchen remodel I ate at pizza hut a lot more than I ever intended to. It actually got to the point where the guy working knew who I was. I don't remember the mangers name but he's a cool dude and once when there was an issue with a payment he helped me out. Now that my kitchen is done I don't eat there often but I do make sure to buy a pizza at least once a month with those guys.

I heard a review that this place was "worth the drive from anywhere" so I decided to take the hour trek up north to find out. I took 2 friends up with me.  It wasn't bad. I liked the touristy feel of the place. I had an apple pie. I loved it. The server was pushing this Jack Daniels pie and I asked for a sample. She brought out an entire slice. She also brought out another slice of apple pie to our table. I thought the service was nice. Everyone was very friendly and treated us good.  My buddy got some coffee which he hated. The server came over and said they coffee hadn't been brewed in a while and apologized and gave him a fresh cup. We went to the general store place next door and checked that out. They had free samples of everything in the store. The fruits and vegetables were fresh and tasted amazing. The guy gave us everything from tomatoes to peaches to salsa to sample. I bought a jar of salsa and my friend loved the apple butter so she bought a jar of that.   I'd say overall this place is pretty cool. I wouldn't drive up there again just for the pie but whenever I go to Flag or Prescott I will pull over and have a pie.

First time was amazing. It was in the old place and it was small and full of character. The food was awesome. I think they put crack in the waffles. I couldn't wait to go back. I've since been back about 12 times in the past year. It's hit and miss some days. Some days the sweet tea is fantastic, some days it's way too sugary....and I have an entire row of teeth dedicated to my sweet tooth....I've been to both the Scottsdale and Phoenix location but I guess I'm getting over it now. The food is good but maybe not worth the price.

Well, it's Dunkin Donuts. They try? Sometimes they make a coffee right. Sometimes they don't. Sometimes they act like they want to be there, sometimes they don't. This one is close to my house but it isn't my favorite location. It's small and the workers act like they don't want to be there.

I've been to Casey Moore's a few times. This past time will be my last time. I met up with a few of my buddies on a Sunday afternoon. We ordered some beer and some food and waited. And waited.....and waited.   It wasn't very busy but out waitress apparently felt it was more important to serve other people in the area rather than us. It might have been because we didn't look like hipsters. Maybe we didn't have enough visible tattoos. Maybe because we don't have any facial piercings? We got plenty of attention from the feral cat that was walking around the place. Perhaps it was left behind from one of the many hippies that frequent this place.   After our nice long wait for our food, the food was wrong. Our waitress was obviously bothered by our requests to get our food correct. I mean we did order the oysters and some sandwiches, clearly we were out of our minds for bothering our server and the kitchen staff to make the food properly. I forgot who ordered what but the sandwich was missing the bacon. We only got one round of beer, not because we only wanted one round, but because our server didn't bother asking if we wanted more.   We would have pulled a dine and dash if our credit card wasn't being held on file for our tab. Between the lackluster food (the oysters are decent), the roaming animals, the dark and gloomy dining area, and the general craptacular wait staff, I'd say avoid this place. Unless you have very low expectations of what a bar/restaurant should be. But even then I think this place would disappoint.

I think this place gets by on reputation as once being an awesome pizza place. I don't think the 2 hour wait was worth it. The pizza was good but to be honest, I've made an awesome pizza with my grill and a few wood chips. I'm glad I got to say I ate there but I won't be doing it again. For the price and the wait, this was more of a flop.

Total hipster hot spot. I'm not a hipster yet I felt comfortable in the shop. The coffee was really good. I also had a pastry and it was superb. It's got a pretty cool vibe and it's a great spot to people watch.

So I met a girl and I wanted to find a place near her work that would impress her but not be too fancy. BINGO!!  This place was awesome. I came on a Wednesday night. I read a review that they have an awesome patio so we ate out there. The patio was in fact awesome. We were the only ones there which at first troubled me a little. This place is truly a hidden gem. I had a glass of wine and I wish I remembered what it was because it was fantastic. We split an app and I had the Boa Bowtie. We were talked into the butter cake at the end of our meal.   I can't stop raving about this place. The date itself went nowhere but you can bet I'll be back here again. What a great place.

This place is great. The sushi is fresh. They do a great job making it. The value is amazing, I think they are underpriced for the service and quality of the food. It's a small place. I like that. As a white guy I really enjoy going to a place where most of the clientele is from the country or part of the world that that place serves. It's authentic good food. I don't like going to a Mexican restaurant filled with white people and I don't like going to a sushi bar full of white people either. This place is legit.

Went there on a Wednesday around 11pm. Ordered chicken taco and carne asada fries. It was good. The fries were crispy and the asada had great flavor. Would definitely go back

I wasn't going to yelp about this place but after reading some of these reviews I think I'll chime in as well. Many people who are complaining about Advantage are the same people who would pee into the wind then cry when it blows back on them.  First of all, Advantage is a discount rental company. If you are in a rush or your time is too important, go to another company. Cheap rates equal long waits. Going to the counter and complaining to the sales agent isn't going to make your trip go any faster and doesn't make their job any more enjoyable. They'd prefer to have no lines too because the last thing they want to hear is about how you spent $5 a day for a car and you had to wait 30 minutes or an hour. You can't even get a beer at a Scottsdale bar for $5.  Secondly, as someone who rents cars often, I can tell you that every company does the same thing. They offer upgrades, coverage, gas, and other things. If that bothers you, go to Hertz and get a gold membership. This is how they get paid. Being an ass and walking up to the counter and telling them "no coverage, no gas" doesn't mean they won't try to offer it. IT'S THEIR JOB. Sometimes if you're cool with them you actually get free upgrades. I've been given a fully loaded Suburban for 1/3 of the cost online. I actually looked up the rate online. I didn't need a Suburban but I'm also not so cheap that an extra $20 ruined my life or my bank account.   Third, book your reservation through their website. It will make your life a ton easier. And when it says "Chevy Malibu or similar" deal with it. They don't put signs on cars with your name on it. You might get a vehicle other than a Chevy Malibu. It might be a SUV. It might be a Toyota. If you're an asshole, it might be a minivan.   When it comes to the coverage, it's not a bad deal. I usually only get just the damage waiver. Maybe I'm unlucky (or I just don't care) but I've ended up damaging 3 rental cars (different cities and companies)  and for $20 it's been worth it every time.

Had to drop off a Xbox to be shipped. Only one person working and long line. Felt bad for her. However her customer service skills were wearing down. Waited for about 30 minutes. Was hoping for a quick transaction with good customer service and got neither

So I'm driving down Scottsdale Rd with my girlfriend and she says she's hungry. The driveway to Mijana was 10 feet in front of me so I whipped in.   This place was great. I loved the decor. The music was festive. I loved the wide open dining area.   We decided to spit the combo for 2. Luckily my girlfriend is gluten free so I got to eat all the pita bread. It was delicious. It was so warm and crispy and airy and....I'm drooling just thinking about it. The food was spectacular. I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants an affordable good meal.

I love this place. It's a drive from my house but so worth it. I'm a fan of Pepsi products and they serve Pepsi. The popcorn is FANTASTIC!! I love the butter topping they use. The prices are good as far as movie prices go. The theatres are in good shape, good sound quality. And did I mention the popcorn was awesome?

My buddy and I have been there a few times. It's a good location. That's about it. The happy hour food is subpar. Drink prices are alright. It's usually pretty open so that's why we go there. Then again with the poor food and lackluster service that could be why.

F this place. I bought a deal from Living Social for 3 hours of housecleaning. My home is only 1400 sq feet. The cleaner only had to clean my master bed and bath, guest bath, kitchen and living room. So I have a small house and she didn't even have to clean all of it, YET she didn't.   I sent a pic to the scheduler showing the pics I took after the cleaning lady left. They offered me 2 hours of free cleaning which I accepted. I then got a text at 10 pm saying they talked to the house cleaner and she was focusing on my main areas of concern. I just wanted my guest bathroom cleaned (she took over an hour and a half) and my floors mopped. Her vacuum broke while she was here and she had to use my broom and dustpan to do her job. When she left I had to vacuum my living room rug. I had to dust my living room, my tv, my dvd player, my end tables and I had to sweep and mop the floor in my living room. I also had to clean my stove top. I had to take out the trash that the cleaner left in the middle of the kitchen. She took the trash out of the bathroom and felt the best place for them was the kitchen I guess.   I have not heard from this company in over a week. Terrible service, terrible cleaning. Terrible company.

After my first review I was called by Busy Bee and they apologized about the cleaning and they said they saw my yelp review and they wanted to make it right and send someone out for an hour to clean my house. I called back and said that would be fine. I then received a few text messages about rescheduling a cleaning. It's been nearly a month and they still haven't cleaned or even responded to my texts. So since they said they saw my yelp review and they said it looked bad on them to have a bad review, I thought I'd let everyone know again that this company is terrible and they don't abide by their word. AVOID THIS COMPANY!!

They don't serve food. They have a food truck. Some days the food trucks are hit and miss. The beer is good. The service is good. Everyone is always friendly. I go there with my friends about every Sunday now. This place is our first Sunday Funday stop. The atmosphere is relaxed and quiet. The prices are very reasonable. It keeps us coming back. Looking forward to the pumpkin porter.

Wasn't impressed.  Walked in on a Sunday around 5. There were 4 people in the bar. Bar was dirty. Was going to order food but decided against it due to the mess. Had the apple pie moonshine. Flavor was good. Served in a shot glass. I understand it's a college bar but my friends and I wanted to have a drink not act like retarded frat boys. Maybe serve drinks in jars? This place is probably okay if you're looking to get drunk on a weekend. Not a place to go if you want to sit and catch up with some friends and do a little Sunday funday social drinking

I got a deal with this company from weeklyplus. I am impressed. The cleaner was good. She made my bathrooms sparkling clean. She rearranged the dogs bed. She straightened my shoes. My kitchen was cleaned top to bottom. The only drawback is that she was late for my appointment but with the fantastic job she did cleaning I'm not even bothered. I'd use them again for sure.

First time at Zia. My girlfriend took me for what was supposed to be a quick in and out visit. I hate shopping. I didn't want to leave this magical wonderland. I was absolutely in love with all the random and eclectic memorabilia. The staff was plentiful and mostly friendly, save for one girl but with all the shiny objects to keep my ADD in full effect, I cared less. I swear this store is a little slice of awesomeness. I mean just walk around like I did in wonderment and awe. It's a huge store and I have a special place in my heart for the awesomeness that is Zia records. On a side note, I forgot to buy anything. I was too childlike with my glee to see old Nintendo games and action figures. I think we were there for an hour before my girlfriend had enough and said it was time to go. I shall return.

This was a fun race. The obstacles weren't tough and geared towards fun rather than challenge. The course was well designed. My competitive side wished there was a way to see how I compared to others in my wave and age group. I didn't see a ton of vendors which was nice because corporate America hasn't taken this event over like warrior dash. It would have been nice to gotten a free beer at the end of the race though.

It's in the same complex as LA Fitness so after a workout I saw the sign and decided I'd try them out.  I've been back several times.   They smoke their meat. It adds a new element to the taste of the quesadillas.  So far I've only gotten the small quesadillas.  The chicken is by far my favorite, but the pork is a close second.   My girlfriend gets the street tacos.  She loves them.  The food is always fresh and the salsa bar has a great selection of salsa, all of them fresh as well.  The only drawback, if it can be called a drawback, is that I have to spend more time on the elliptical; but in the case of TC Taco, it's well worth it.

I'm actually writing this review in the restaurant. This is the second time at this location, fool me once shame on you, fool me twice.... The waitress dropped off the check and it appears I have plenty of time to write this. It could be understandable if it were busy but it's Saturday night and there are 5 other people here. We got here at 7:30 and there were 8 people here. So a busy full restaurant isn't the issue. We ordered the buffalo chicken pizza, personal size for 2. I had a slice and decided I'd had enough. I was guilted into having another slice by my girlfriend because she didn't want the staff here to see that I could barely tolerate a slice of their pizza. Maybe the other location is better but this place is lackluster at best. It's hard to find from the street, there is little signage and I can see why it's so dead here on a Saturday night.   Overall, if you want average at best pizza for a premium price, this is your place.   If slow service, forgetting water, bringing a pizza and not any plates is your idea of top notch wait staff quality you'll absolutely love this place.   Don't be surprised if this location is closed before summer
