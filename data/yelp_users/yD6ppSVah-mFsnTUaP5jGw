Went here to buy some bread but they were closed early @5:45pm  The clock on their wall is 15m ahead.  I showed the cashier the correct time and she said "so what!" Don't go here  The bread is expired and the employees are rude

"SHOW ME YOUR PAPERS!" I was on the patio with my friends lap dog when a large man wearing a black chefs uniform barked at me "does it have papers." I replied I'm dog sitting and yes I'm am sure he is registered in Maricopa, I know he is up to date on all his vaccines. I then waived my husband to come over quickly. The large man then said "I need to see your papers. If you do not have them on you, you will have to leave." I felt embarrassed because he had drawn attention to me and was now asking me for papers. Being a Chicano this is very offensive. I quickly stood up, turned around and left. I will tell all my friends how I was treated at desoto.
