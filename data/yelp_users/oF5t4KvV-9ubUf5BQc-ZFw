Such a great company that truly takes pride in not only their craftsmanship, but their interaction with the customer throughout the entire process. By far had the most competitive pricing and flexibility in designing/building. I would recommend talking to these guys first prior to signing with other companies. I'm writing this because they truly deserve the positive review and because I'm a very satisfied customer.

White Sangria is great and the tacos are even better. They had an Octopus taco that was awesome. Ahi tuna taco was great as well. Great food. Guac was really good.

Best revolving sushi in town compared to the one by Arrowhead and Teharu in Tempe. Reasonable prices. Quality and taste is better. Grand Canyon, Hawaiian and Spicy Tuna are the favorites. Flat screen TVs with sports games are available.

6 flights of the sampler brew is the best way to go and try numerous kinds. Pork Animal burger is the best burger I've had. Definitely will be coming back.

This place was basically like buying a Lexus on Craigslist and being disappointed that the engine is a Kia Rio. High ratings on Yelp lured me to choose this place over many other places that I know have notably not disappointed regardless of their Yelp reviews. This is my second time eating here despite being disappointed the first time (gave it a second try and thought time would improve the food/experience). I have eaten at many different pho places in the valley (Pho Chandler, Angelina's Pho, Pho Avina, Pholicious, Pho Thanh (both locations), Little Saigon, Pho Binh, 43rd Express, Da vang, unPhogettable , Khai Hoan) and this by far ranks last on my list. Pho is priced much higher with less food than the competitors, it was also more oily than most and one the people in my party ordered pork chop and rice (which they forgot and rushed to us that ended up being raw, I saw it and it was basically still oinking and we all eat rare steak so this was unreal).

I was pretty excited about this place opening up in AZ having had it for every day for two weeks in Jersey, but I was very disappointed about the quality and pricing of my order...the "Arizona" with steak which cost $9.99 + $2.00 for the steak. It came with of brown rice with tomato and green onions. I normally wouldn't waste my time doing reviews like this, but this was far different from what I had back in Jersey. The protein (steak) reminded me of tiny steak left overs from your steak burrito from a local Filibertos, but far less in amount...meaning I essentially paid for brown rice, tomatoes and green onions for $9.99. The same dish in Jersey was chunky steak that equalled the proportion of your rice not 1/10 steak and 9/10 rice/tomato/green onions. If you want real steak and chicken with rice Greek Wraps on 75th Ave and Bell Rd will satisfy your craving and well worth the $10 you will spend.
