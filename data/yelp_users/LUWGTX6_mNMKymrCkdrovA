It's okay. Same as most the other Barnes & Nobles, the employees are moderately helpful. And the staff in the Cafe is not the most friendly bunch. I do understand that they probably get annoyed by all the people that come and sit around in the cafe and don't buy anything, or ask for free water, but come on... that's just the way it is. Overall, I will continue to go to this location since it is near my work, but I wouldn't go OUT OF my way to go here.

This Review will be updated as I see what they do after emailing the Service Director...  I bought a 2010 Camaro from Chapman Chevrolet in May 2010. I added the Wheel and Tire Protection Plan at an additional fee. I got a flat tire last Friday.    On Friday I spoke to Ernest Saldana, he said he wouldn't have the replacement tire until Monday because it would have to be picked up in Phoenix. I asked if I could drop my car off Friday or Saturday (I had a spare on at this point) and if there are loaner cars available. (Which is clearly something that most other Dealerships do) He said no, they don't. I asked, "Are you SURE you don't have loaner cars???" Then he said yes, but they are all taken. That kind of attitude makes me feel like Chapman could care less whether they get my business. I told him I would try to just deal with it on my own over the weekend. I ended up picking up some shifts at work so I was unable to deal with it. So I called the Service department today to see if I could get the tire taken care of today, or tomorrow... he said tomorrow. I said okay tomorrow, and I asked how late the Service Department was open, his answer 5:00, even though it clearly states 6:00 pm on the website. I asked how long it would take to change the tire, his answer one hour. Then I said I would be there at 4:00 tomorrow. MY GOAL IS TO NOT HAVE TO TAKE EXCESS TIME OFF WORK. Then he says, "actually they are going to be leaving at 4:30." Once again I said forget it and I will take my business elsewhere. This is incredibly frustrating since I paid EXTRA for a Tire and Wheel  Protection Plan that has proven to be more of a hassle then it is worth. Here is one more thing that frustrates me... I called another Chevy dealership at 1:00 today who said he would go get the tire from another location and be ready to put it on by 2:30 TODAY!!!! That is good customer service. Unfortunately he does not offer protection on the tire for future damage. He suggested that I contact the Service Director or even go to Discount Tire where they ALSO offer a tire protection plan.

I sent an email at 2:00PM... and received a call the following day from the Service Manager. I told him that I dealt with it myself (Discount Tire is AWESOME!!) and he just told me that for any future service issues I can contact him directly...

It is what it is... a complete and utter Dive(bar). A little hole-in-the-wall. Fortunately I love a good dive and its right down the street. I have only been here a few times, but its definitely on my list for visit soon. Well... lets say its on the top of my list, with Applebee's Nightclub at the bottom (Yes, its true. The Applebee's in Laveen turns into a raunchy, skanky nightclub on Friday and Saturday nights)  BTW... I have not seen with my own eyes, but I have been told that there is a horse tie up in front of the bar where you can tie your trusty steed while you enjoy your Coors Light or what have-you. I guess I need a horse.

I would like to give zero stars right now. I am pissed. I have used SuperShuttle numerous times over the years. They have always done their job at a competitive price.  On September 1st I talked to the driver from SuperShuttle who picked up my fiance to go to the airport for his trip to France and asked if they would pick me up on the 12th with the 2 dogs in their crates, and if there would be additional fees. I was told no, that it was no problem. Now I am being told that it would be $70!  Deceptive!! And HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE ON THE PHONE. So RUDE and not very understanding.  I will not use them again, and I will make sure no one in our company does either.

I absolutely LOVE this place. They have such a wonderful staff of servers and bartenders. They are super personable and friendly. The drinks are stiff, and the food is great.  My favorite is the Chicken and Red Pepper Flatbread, which is half priced on Wednesdays. But worth full price any day of the week... so try it!

I know... I know. Tanning=Bad. But I likey.  I have been going to Laveen Tanning on and off for the last 2 years. Mostly before I have a trip or event coming up. I originally purchased a 3 month unlimited pass, but my skin didn't thank me for that. So last time I went in I opted for the unit purchase which is much better for me, especially because the Units don't expire.   The facility is clean and there is hardly a wait when I go in. The 2 gentlemen that run the business are great! They are always friendly and usually see my pull up and park, and as I am parking they grab my lotion. (Also, very convenient for them to keep lotions in a plastic baggy in a secure room... Did you know that when exposed to heat lotions will break down and stop working... that stuff is way to expensive to be destroying.)  My one word of advice is that they need a website! They had one, but the prices were not updated. Now I can't find one. In this day ALL BUSINESSES need a website!!!!

Scooptacular really is spectacular! They have a great variety of  ice creams all made in-house (Laveen Concrete Mix is my fave!!) The staff is very nice and friendly. They are quick to offer you a sample of any ice creams you would like to try. I am not sure how long this shop has been open, but I really hope they last. We go about once a week, which is all my butt can afford. Ironically we go after hiking on South Mountain, so I suppose it all cancels out. :)  So, if you are ever in the Laveen Area, definitely make a stop at Scooptacular!! I saw a flyer there yesterday that said they also do Birthday Parties in the Shop where they show guests how to make ice cream. I suppose 33 is too old to have a Birthday Party there, so I will instead get one of their Ice Cream Birthday Cakes.... mmmm!
