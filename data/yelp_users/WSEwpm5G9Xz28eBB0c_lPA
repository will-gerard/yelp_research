Best place to buy guitars and pedals... Great workers there.  Super mega awesome customer service.  I wouldn't get my instruments from anyone else.

Amazing food.  Busy though and pricey. Make reservations ahead of time and get there early so your table is ready by the time your reservation is set for.

Well, I don't know what to say about Bergies. I'm sad really because it looked so promising. When you walk up to it, the curb appeal is so pleasing. I wanted to hang out there all day. I liked the atmosphere a lot.   I went up to the register inside the building and you can tell that the people behind the counter must have just gotten over a giant rush, because they resembled deer in headlights. I used to be a barista, so I know this look on their faces. I definitely didn't get a hello until I was done looking at the menu (which works for me because I would like to look before I'm interrogated).  I asked him if they could make me an espresso con panna. He definitely didn't know what it was, but explained another drink on the menu as if I didn't know what it was. I give him two thumbs way up for knowledge of menu items, but two thumbs down for not knowing what a con panna is. They made it for me regardless and it looked delicious, however, this is where my two stars comes into play.   I wanted to give them four stars, but the espresso tasted like water. It was over extracted, too light on the tongue, the texture was almost gritty, and the double shot (one pull) was almost four ounces...which explains as to why it tasted like water. I had to wash it down with my friend's Chai to just finish it. Not the worst espresso shots I've ever had, but definitely in the top three.  I hope my next two experiences will prove them wrong as I see a lot of great reviews and potential for this place.

Best Bahn Mi in Phoenix.  Huge portions.  The real deal.  Extra parking in back and next to Asian market. You can order by number at counter for to go and walk around the Asian market till your food is done.

I walked into Giant for the first time and the atmosphere was great. They have these window doors that slide open and expose you to the outside, which is very awesome because it was nice out. I noticed that they have an awesome layout and concrete floors. The ambiance is fantastic. The music was basically whatever I hear in all the cafes now and it wasn't too loud. They have parking around the back, self serve water and restrooms for customers too. Which is all great in Central Phoenix area.   I like how simple the menu is on drinks. They don't dress it up, because lets face it, if the espresso isn't good then they would cover it up with lots of syrups and sauces for you and they'd offer them. You can tell this place WANTS you to taste the coffee. I appreciate that as I am all about that.   The two people behind the counter greeted me with smiles before I even got to the front and one was displaying the food (I'm assuming she was the baker as it was a fresh quiche she brought out). The food looked very delicious. I ordered a slice and asked for water (where I found out that it was self serve) and asked for an espresso shot (one pull). It came with a soda water to cleanse my pallet and the girl who made it definitely weighed my shots and made sure that my espresso was perfect. She took her time to make sure it was up to her standards (I'd wait as long as it takes for a delicious cup of coffee over a high produced fast paced one).   In about two minutes my drink was ready and I was able to enjoy it with my quiche (which she hand delivered both to me). The shots themselves had a great crema coloring and the viscosity was very nice. It was definitely a bit more citrusy than I was expecting, but all in all, it was great coffee. It wasn't sour, or bitter, or whatever have you and the service was fantastic.   As I was sitting there I noticed that they knew lots of people's drinks, they joked around with the customers, and they have high standards for the espresso and food items they serve.   I was blown away with the greatness of this place. I heard some stories that they were pretentious, but they weren't even close to that. I've been to several cafes just down the street that I'd say were flat out rude compared to these two young ladies that helped me today.  If you gave it a shot a year ago and didn't like it, try it again. It's worth it, trust me.

April came into my work once while in downtown Phoenix.  I came into her  work a month later and she remembered me and how nice I was when I served her in Phoenix.  The staff was super awesome and she made me a cortado.  The milk was steamed to a great temperature and the espresso was phenomenal.  Seattle based and delicious.  Thank you April.  - Michelle from Songbird

Every single time I'm here is more entertaining than the last.  Right now there's a guy who can help you with your beer floats,  he's friendly  and good looking.  The chefs know what they are doing and the beers are always changing. It's got a parking lot and a happy hour.  Woo.

Zoolights itself is always amazing and fun and friendly,  however,  the ticket takers were very short.  It upset me enough to pause my enjoyment to write a review.

Best fried pickles ever. I swear there's something addictive in the batter because I need them at least once a week.

The internet is impossible to use. Management takes two weeks to respond to any email you send them. The gates lock you in and out, so delivery of anything poses a giant issue if you can't be there to get it. I'm pretty sure that's also a fire hazard. Parking is a giant nightmare and construction for the new parking structures next door will keep you up. Paid laundry, but only two washer and dryer so they are always full.
