I saw a review on here knocking Cafe Mix, and I wanted to get on here and ask why? Do you have nothing better to do with your life? Cafe Mix pumps out amazing food that is always high quality.   Cafe Mix place has the BEST Gyro meat, this coming from a person that has been to Greece. You will not be disappointed with anything on the menu.

Wow. Just wow.   After a long and strenuous battle of getting out of Fitness Works clutches, I'm back in them again.  I joined fitness evolution on a special promotion in January. $10 a month with no contract, cancel anytime.  I get a charge on my card for $39 on March 20th for "Fitness Works ABC*. I begrudgingly call Fitness Works they tell me that apparently my account was never cancelled, (I sent in a written cancellation 8 months ago with no payments since.)   They tell me to call customer service, so I do. They lady tells me my account has been cancelled for 8 months and she is not sure why I got a charge. She asks for my cancellation letter and a copy of my bank statement. I give it to her.  She calls me back 10 minutes later and tells me oh looks like you joined fitness evolution in January. Apparently Fitness Works "merged" with Fitness Evolution.  The $39 charge was an "annual fee", that I certainly did not agree too. She asks me if I have my contract, I told her I didn't have it and that Fitness Evolution never gave me a copy. I asked her if she had it, she told me that they where still getting all of the paperwork from the gym.  I asked this ignoramus if I can send her a written cancellation like I did previously. She declined, and told me the new management was cracking down on cancellations.  So, Fitness Works do you make it a habit of blindly charging your customers cards without any documentation?  You have no problem charging my card without my knowledge or approval, but you make me jump through hoops to cancel my membership with your shitty gym.  Peace.
