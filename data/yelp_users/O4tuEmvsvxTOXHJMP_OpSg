I only go to this gym during the day on my lunch hour (it's right next to my work) so I am not sure about the after work crowds but during the day it is never over crowded. I love this particular LA fitness because the treadmills have TV's built in (vs. the LA Fitness by my house which just has over head hanging TV's pre-set on different channels) The locker rooms are clean and since I have yet to buy a lock I always leave my clothes, etc. in an open locker and have never had any problems with theft or tampering. The  best part is the personal trainers have never approached me about purchasing training, etc.  in my book clean + personal TV's + open machines & uninterrupted workouts is everything I need in my gym experience!

I LOVE this place. The women that work there are so nice and helpful, I don't even scrapbook but the scrapbook room makes me want to SO bad. The furniture is amazing, from what I have seen better quality than Anthropologie and less expensive too. and ohhh the chandeliers!!! I have looked up, down, and around the world for chandeliers and they have the most perfect ones ever.  We stopped in for supplies for Christmas gifts we were putting together and found almost everything we needed. I will definitely be back - even if you are not looking for anything specific you will more than likely find the exact something you have been searching/wishing for.

Bark Avenue Pet Resort is right next to Bark Avenue Pet Supply as well as Bark Ave Hospital, super convenient. I have been searching for an alternative to our mobile groomer recently based on budget cuts, cutting the dog's expenses means less cutting of mine ;)   I HATE grooming my dogs because it seems so unnatural (& I hate them being lathered in products, especially scented ones, ew) but between the little one getting dread locks and the bigger one having some weird curling dew claw toenails, it is sadly necessary. Bark Avenue uses more "eco-friendly" products than most and every time I have gone in there the people are SUPER nice.   Today was their first time being groomed there and it was the best haircut my little dog has ever had! Most of the time he looks ridiculous and some groomers do a poof ball on his head (he is not a poodle, he is a Bichon/Pomeranian) or cut his face too short or don't cut enough off of his ears but the guy at Bark Avenue (Sergio) got everything just right! The big dog just gets shaved so he couldn't really mess that up, but regardless, she looked beautiful too! We will definitely be going back and as far as price - it was $82 (ideally it would have been $70) for both as opposed to $110 with our mobile groomer so definitely still an improvement!

My husband and I are so thankful we found Virgil and his shop. He is so honest, hardworking, and has the best prices on EVERYTHING. After BMW North Scottsdale told me there was something wrong with my oil tank and was going to cost me over $900 I took it to Virgil for a second opinion. He checked it out same day and called back saying absolutely nothing was wrong. I went that evening to pick it up and Jeremy didn't even charge me a penny. They are all so nice, helpful, and knowledgeable. To date they have worked on my BMW, my old Xterra, my husband's Xterra and we will continue to take any car of ours in the future to them. I would recommend them to ANYBODY looking for a reliable, trusted mechanic which has the best prices around to boot!

The only service I have ever received at Total Bliss is nails & toes. I have been going to Pam for almost 5 years and she is awesome!!! Acrylics, gel nails, manicures, pedicures, I have had them all and am always extremely happy. They have the gel nail polish "Shellac" here as well as a few other colors in a different brand. This stuff is AMAZING. Goes on like regular nail polish but is cured under the UV lamp and lasts for WEEKS with no chips whatsoever. Does no damage to your nails and keeps the same natural finish as regular nail polish. The salon is always clean and provides late appointments some days. My mom gets facials there ( I can't remember the girl's name :/ ) and loves them as well. Would definitely recommend booking an appointment with Pam if you are in the Gilbert area and need some nail help :)

I never shop at AJ's. That being said I have stopped into the Baseline & Val Vista location for the salad bar, coffee, and sushi and have always been really pleased.  I made a trip to this AJ's to obtain some specialty items for my husbands upcoming birthday dinner I was preparing. He requested prime rib and I am NOT into meat nor do I know anything about certain types, cuts, etc. of meat. Knowing I was heading to a "fine foods" store though I was comfortable with the expectation someone who works in the meat department would be extremely knowledgeable and help me with my purchase. I was absolutely wrong. The two gentleman working the meat counter had less meat knowledge than I did. They did not know a single thing about prime rib including if they even sell it there nor were they offering to find someone else in the store who did.   I also wanted to pick up some sweet sparkling red wine as a celebratory after dinner treat. I asked the head of the wine department to help me and he pointed me to two different bottles stating they were both very sweet. I purchased the sparkling Syrah (against my better judgment thinking the entire time in my mind that syrah is not a sweet varietal, but reassuring myself this guy does this for a living and what do I actually know about sparkling red wine) which as it turns out, was NOT sweet at ALL.   I headed over to the bakery for some carrot cake, again at the request of my husband, and was confident having read so many reviews raving over their cake I would find something insanely delicious. They have two different carrot cakes, one from a third party and one they make in house. The girl working in the bakery actually recommended the third party offering that "it's better than ours and the pieces are bigger" Again, trusting the employee's advice I purchased two pieces.  It was the most disgusting piece of carrot cake I have ever ate. The frosting tasted more like old sour cream than frosting making the whole HUGE piece basically inedible.   Very disheartening experience. I recovered by heading to Whole Foods (on Mayo) were I absolutely can always count on all of the employees being so helpful and insanely knowledgeable. There was no prime rub displayed here either but of course the meat man went in the back and cut a piece especially for me offering lots of advice on cooking, seasoning etc. I was so upset at myself for ever doubting that my beloved Whole Foods could not handle the "fine foods" dinner I wished to prepare.

SWIHA really does have it all. Insane, inexpensive massages, great yoga classes, meditation classes, and curriculum that is life-changing and basically non-existent anywhere else.   I have received massages twice here and not only are they super cheap but they give a student discount! The yoga classes are inexpensive as well and I have never found one I didn't enjoy.    So far I have taken 3 nutrition classes that have completely changed my life and am signed up to continue the rest of the holistic nutrition program. My husband and I are also signed up for the whole foods cooking classes that we both are dying to start in September as well as a meditation and mindfulness class that we can not stop talking about. Everybody is extremely welcoming and very helpful. It is such a breeze to make a payment, sign up/change your classes, and everyone always has a smile on their face!   All classes can be taken individually (as opposed to being enrolled in a program or requiring prerequisites) and most are only 1 day/night a week for about 5 weeks so it's not a huge commitment. Many classes are offered online as well. SWIHA is an incredible place to meet tons of really awesome people and learn so much more than you expected regarding health, wellness, nutrition, spirituality, herbalism, etc! They also give out guest passes so you can sit in on any class before signing up which is so helpful.   I have not tried Southwest Institute of Natural Aesthetics yet but plan on it VERY soon!

Michael is the best tattoo artist, ever. Go see him for anything you  might want done! To date he has tattooed my husband, brother, mom, best friend, and half a dozen acquaintances. To date, nobody has had any complaints either. He is awesome at drawing and will definitely come up with something you love, reasonably priced, and works quickly (which is a major plus in my book when you are undergoing immense pain) Just an all around funny guy too, you will definitely enjoy your experience :)

I have frequented more MAC stores than I can count and this one is one of my favorites. They had a DJ the night we went in and the atmosphere is so much fun. All of the employees are SO nice & helpful and will pull samples, find products, anything you might want - even despite the fact that they are super busy! I have gotten my makeup done countless times at different MAC stores as well and besides the girl who did my wedding makeup this time was my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE. I wish I remembered this girls name but she listened to what I wanted, applied it extra thick (necessary for a night out in Vegas) and added her own personal creativity. My face seriously looked just as beautiful when I got in than when I first left and I never even reapplied. Definitely check out this store if you're a MAC fan and ever in Vegas :)

I would like to say first that my 1 star does not reflect the food available at this buffet at all, entirely the service. That being said that food is not much different than many other high end buffets offered on the strip for the exact same price, and certainly not more delicious or different enough to go back and undergo the same treatment.   A group of 5 of us decided to have brunch there on Sunday. The line was incredibly long but we were not in a hurry and waited patiently for about 30-40 minutes. We were all on vacation, staying at the hotel, and this was our last opportunity to spend time together before we all left (to various cities/states) later that evening. Each of us ordered the "unlimited" champagne option with the intention of eating, drinking, and hanging out for quite some time.   At first our server was very helpful. He was friendly and was prompt to refill our waters, juice, and champagne. After we were there for a couple of hours he asked us if we needed anything else because he was getting ready to leave. This was obviously his cue that he wanted a tip but that was fine, most of us have worked in the service industry and he was polite about it. Two of us had tipped him on our credit card and another one of us at the table gave him $20 upon this cue.   30 minutes or so passed and we were all running low on drinks and a new server had not been by to greet us. We spotted him walking by and asked him if he could refill our drinks or send whichever coworker was going to be taking over our table. At this point his personality had taken a complete 180 and he rudely explained that we drank too much and he wasn't going to provide anymore refills on the "unlimited" champagne. This was entirely untruthful and ridiculous for all of the following reasons:  1) We had been there for 3 hours at this point, yes we had been drinking semi-continuously during this time but we were also continuously eating.  2) there were FIVE of us, obviously the amount of champagne the entire table consumed was going to be elevated vs. most tables of 2 or 3 3) Not once did anybody at the table show any signs of intoxication of the slightest bit. There was nothing spilled, dropped, no falling down, no impaired walking, no harsh words, absolutely no indication that a single person should not continue to be served.  4) Just because you have already received your tip from a table that you may or may not have found to be adequate for the amount of time they were taking up space in your section is NEVER a valid reason to begin acting rude and uncooperative.   We then asked to speak with the manager to demonstrate that everybody at the table was in a clear state of mind and express how unfair and unhappy we were with the treatment. She was of absolutely no help and then explained she could give us "one more round, but that was it" SO if the argument is that a table has drank far too much and can not be served anymore for "legal purposes" as we were told doesn't it seem a bit counter intuitive and just plain wrong to provide with them "just one more drink" Exactly.   After all of this one of the girls at our table decided to go up to the bar to purchase her own drink and of course, they took her money and served her one.   Yes there are probably people that take advantage of the "unlimitedness" of the buffet but isn't that the POINT?? We are not there every weekend doing this we were simply trying to get the most out of our last day there.  We were tipping well, spending money on Keno, and being extremely decent and respectful to everyone that worked there.   As mentioned earlier the food is of no superior quality to the plethora of other brunches on or near the strip at the same price: Wynn, Bayside Buffet, Rio, even Treasure Island and I am sure the experience would be much more pleasant.

I have recently started painting and Utrecht is the only art supply store I have been to so I do not have anything to compare it to, just my experience the past few times I have frequented. They have a wide assortment of ALL supplies, I always want everything I see! They do not carry Alkyd paints though FYI. I originally chose Alkyd paint because it is lower in VOC's than other oil paints but as they run out I am going to start using acrylics so this is not really an inconvenience at all.   But they DO carry Golden Open Acrylics brand which are "slow drying acrylics" as opposed to the Alkyds which are "fast drying oils" if you happen to be looking for something in that middle ground.   They always have a lot of different items on sale and the store clerks are always so friendly and helpful that I definitely see many more trips to Utrecht in my future!

This place was perfect for a quick grab and go while in Vegas without sacrificing quality and gosh forbid getting fast food. I was extremely picky and made a million special requests and they fulfilled each one even better than I expected. The food was quick and delicious despite the place being very busy, would definitely recommend!

I haven't been to Picazzo's since their organic & gluten free "revamp" but have been looking forward to it for quite awhile.   I went for lunch today and the menu really is quite impressive. Quinoa pasta galore, gluten free crust, baked (free range, humane, non-hormone treated) chicken wings, nitrate free organic bacon, and more!!   I had no idea what to even order and definitely plan on going back. The chicken wings were "ok" but honestly get an A for effort considered they were made without being fried tons of awful polyunsaturated fats (vegetable oil) The greek salad was very fresh and tasty and the girlfriend I was with really enjoyed her pizza. I brought a pizza home for my husband with gluten free crust and it definitely did not disappoint.   It was fairly busy for lunch but our appetizers and entree did take quite awhile to come out to the table (hence the 4 stars)  I really do not like pizza at all so I am not much of a critic when it comes to the perfect slice but am very much looking forward to going back to sample more salads and pastas!

St. Francis is officially my absolute favorite place to have Sunday Brunch. I have had dinner there before and the food was outstanding. Last Sunday my husband and I ventured in for brunch for the first time and not only were we surprised that one of our valley favorites, Dennis Rowland, was performing live jazz but that every last bit of food and drink we ordered was incredible.   The servers are always super nice, the ambiance is a perfect blend of sophistication and personality and I will definitely be there for Sunday brunch as frequently as possible.  It is also a great place to grab a glass of wine or one of several amazing cocktails, day time or evening!

I love Bark Avenue so much! It is definitely expensive though and a lot of things I would love to get here are out of my price range, so it gets 4 stars instead of 5. They have ever flavor of Primal dog food (best dog food ever! but again, pricey) in all different sizes too. They have meaty bones and a lot of other high quality raw meat dog food options as well (one of the few places around the valley that do). They carry a lot of specialty items you won't find at Petsmart, PetCo, etc and the people who work there are usually very knowledgeable and friendly. They do close pretty early (6pm on M&F, 5pm on Saturday and 7pm Tues-Thurs) usually right around the time I realize I am out of dog food ;) so do be careful of that. Although it may not become a regular stop because of the price of most items I definitely recommend stopping in to check it out & grabbing a special treat or two for your pets!

My husband & I have been avid BWW goer's ever since we moved to Gilbert 3 years ago. We frequented the McQueen & Elliot location almost once a week the entire time we lived nearby.  The wings are awesome and it's the best place to watch any kind of sports. Every time friends come in town we take them to Thursday night $.50 wings & $3 you-call-its.   We have since moved to East Mesa and last night two good friends where in town visiting. We were on our way home when they asked about BWW and said they had been really looking forward to making a trip there while they were in town.  It was 12:30 am and we were driving nearby this location. I wasn't sure what time they closed so I looked up the number on my phone quickly and called to ask. Someone answered the phone and said "we close at 1." We knew we were cutting it close but were craving wings so we decided we would run in, order wings togo, have one round of drinks while they were being cooked and make it out right at closing. We have all worked in the service industry so we are very cognizant of common restaurant courtesy and always tip extremely well.  When we walked in we were immediately faced with the manager, Shana I believe, who very rudely said "we are closed." My husband looked at his phone and said it is only 12:40 and we just called and someone told us you close at 1. She said she was indeed the person who answered the phone and her clock actually said it was 12:55 and they are closed. We explained our intention of ordering togo and having one drink and she again very rudely  said the bar was absolutely off limits they did last call 20 minutes ago and if we HAD to order food it we would be waiting for awhile because she would have to "refire" up the kitchen and get everything back out since its all been cleaned up already.   At this point we had no intention of staying and were really offended at how we were being treated. We calmly explained we would have appreciated if she had been truthful with us on the phone. If she had simply replied that they close at 1 but the kitchen has already cleaned up and last call for the bar was 20 minutes ago we would not have even wasted the time to drive there.  She did not apologize and was still speaking to us with a ridiculous attitude. Everyone was frustrated at this point and as we started to a leave a server that had walked up earlier called my husband an "asshole". This was completely appalling, so unnecessary, absolutely undeserved and insanely unprofessional.   We will NEVER go back to this location, if you are craving BWW stop in to the McQueen & Elliot location where all of the staff are super friendly, accommodating and professional.

Beautiful! The staff is super friendly, I had a horrible first impression experience at The Golden Door Spa at the Boulders on Tuesday and opted to leave, despite the fact that my sister in law & I had a long spa day planned out. So I desperately called Joya Spa at 11:20am they fit us both in at 12pm!! (and were completely accommodating even though we were 5 minutes late since the drive from cave creek is not a short one)  Both ladies did a fabulous job on our Gelish manicure and pedicures & were unbelievably quick and skilled at their craft.   The robes are SO comfortable (an obvious requirement) the facilities are very clean and impeccable and the whisper room... awww. Basically the most comfortable couches and beds complete with pillows and blankets that I have ever encountered, heaven. None of the spas I have been to have had an equivalent to this unbelievably relaxing area, so nice, so comfortable.   I would give 4.5 stars if I could but it was just too nice so I rounded up, my only wish was that the private terrace pool was a bit nicer. The loungers and chairs are great, it is just a small area and the actual pool seemed a little dirty and was very small as well.   Overall it was a fantastic spa experience (& I have been to quite a few) and I was even more pleased to find out they have a "coed relaxation room" and now I can not wait to come back with my husband for couple's massages and a little quiet time at the pool.

BEST. Sunday. Brunch. Ever. Their super pricey seasonal brunch does not start until October, so our experience was the $22 with the $8 unlimited champagne option. Best $30 I have ever spent! Our server was extremely nice and accommodating the entire time we were there which was from 10:30 until they closed around 1:00pm and even helped us move inside when it got too hot outside.    All of the food is insanely delicious. The man behind the counter will make you pancakes, waffles, omelets all any way you desire! The warm cheese blintzes are to die for. The fruit is super fresh and delicious too and I can not WAIT to go back when it cools off a bit and enjoy the delightful scenery surrounding the patio.

I can't wait to go back!! Found exactly what I was looking for (a corked glass bottle to put my homemade mouthwash gift in) almost as soon as I walked in. Tons of cute gifts, even for the person you think is most impossible to buy for. Great greeting cards, I honestly wanted to buy 90% of them just to have. Gentleman behind the counter was so super nice - and again, I just can't wait to go back!

I am not a member of LA Fitness so this review is just for the front desk staff & smoothie bar.   I have been wanting to try a new protein/whole foods supplement powder called "Pure Trim" and it seems you can only buy it online(in packs of 10). I found out from a friend though that this LA Fitness location happens to carry it! I ventured over there one day when I was in the area and asked the girl at the front desk if I could just grab a smoothie, even though I am not a member. She was super polite and showed me exactly where it was. The man working the smoothie bar was incredibly helpful and made me a smoothie exactly the way I wanted using the Pure Trim powder. He also let me try a shot of the liquid multivitamin the Pure Trim company also sells. He only charged me $3 for the smoothie (which is the cost of the individual powder packet) unlike Whole Foods who seriously charges for the protein powder packet and then the entire cost of a regular smoothie and you end up with a ridiculous $8+ smoothie that doesn't even taste good! I really appreciated that and if I am ever in the area again (which is very rare) I will definitely stop in for another one :)

LOVER of this place. seriously, such a great place. Drinks do take awhile but they are worth it. Awesome cappuccinos and the best reason ever to come here, COCONUT & ALMOND MILK. I try to avoid dairy at all costs (and soy) and besides Whole Foods & The Center Bistro no coffee places ever have coconut or almond options. They also have a delicious dark chocolate sauce, yum!  The ambiance is unbeatable, so friendly- couches, newspapers, magazines, best place to spend an afternoon or evening. And on top of all of that, they are non profit! Definitely check this gem out :)

This place is incredible. The atmosphere, the wine & beer, the service, and above all else the food. It is a tad pricey but worth every penny and more. GREAT date night spot, great place to get together with a group of friends, great for appetizers, just dessert, wine, anything you can think of. I definitely plan on showcasing this place whenever friends or family come into town.   If there is a large group make sure and call ahead for reservations because it is a small dining room and it does fill up!!

I seriously want to love Oakville so much, but in reality, it sucked. It seriously has all of the right things in one place, but the execution is so poor, which makes me even more upset.   I needed a place to work on my laptop for awhile, grab a salad and glass of wine on a Thursday afternoon turning evening at the conclusion of a long week. I ordered a salad that cost $15, the person who brought it out informed me they were out of some ingredients - it literally was a plastic bowl with TONS of spinach, some chicken, and a few nuts. There are no outlets to plug in your computer except one in the back near the wine. There were numerous people working but I was still unable to order a glass of wine after quite some time, nor did anybody ever ask if I needed anything.   I decided I was not comfortable at all and needed to leave and contemplated, since I was already there and the wine selection seemed quite robust, purchasing a bottle for home. They have no organic wines, no local wines, or any "no sulfites/sulfates added" options. Fail.   They do have Essence macaroons which is a major plus except all of the flavors are on one plate without labels, I decided to purchase one on my way out since I was feeling down about my whole experience but the girl did not know which colors were which exact flavor and I wasn't in the mood to chance getting a flavor I may not be partial too :(

I just bought a brand new Blackberry Torch in August when they first came out. Over the weekend my screen went completely black and the phone would not turn on at all.  I took it in Sunday afternoon to this AT&T location and Sean was EXTREMELY helpful and very nice. He checked my phone out and couldn't get it to turn on either so he gave me a brand new Torch right out of the box and got it up and working as quickly as possible. I had purchased a screen cover when I originally bought the phone and he gave me a new one at no charge to me, saying it wasn't my fault the phone just stopped working.   I REALLY appreciated that he also let me use the restroom which technically was employee's only - I really had to go.   Anything to do with cell phone malfunctions is quite stressful and Sean's customer service made what could have been such a terrible situation SO much better. I really love coming across people this nice and helpful because it seems like such a rarity these days.

I originally switched my car insurance over to State Farm with Linda in the summer of 2008. Since then my husband has added his vehicle, we obtained homeowner's insurance through her and added a third vehicle we purchased this year. We were also in the process of adding insurance for my wedding ring and deciding on life insurance that would best fit our needs but was still affordable for us right now.  With all of the above insurance we have through Linda we had an expectation of being treated with exceptional customer service. We have not been. She stopped responding to our emails and phone calls and instead one of her assistants does. Both are incredibly hard to deal with, they never know what is going on with our policies, can not provide accurate information, and usually can not answer questions with a straight forward answer. They seem very unorganized and while Linda is very friendly these assistant's you are actually forced to deal with are not.   We are in the process of switching over our insurance to someone that makes us feel comfortable, is organized, and we do not dread receiving phone calls from. I would definitely not recommend taking your insurance needs to this office.

We wrote Linda an email about 2 weeks ago explaining we are switching all of our insurance to someone else beginning the 23rd of November (we got the exact same homeowners insurance at Allstate for almost $200 less dollars) and how we felt and she, or someone else in her office, never even replied.

Funktional Fitness is my favorite place to work out, ever! Everyone who works here is extremely friendly and helpful all of the time, no matter if you work out with them individually or not. The environment is very comfortable and all of the trainers provide knowledge, workouts, motivation, and reliability at a much higher caliber than you will find at any chain gym and even many other personal training studios. It is obvious that everybody who works at Funktional Fitness cares a great deal about their own health and the health of their clients as well.   I have been training with Kristina three times a week for 8 weeks and throughout that time she has really taken the time to listen to my desires and goals and talk with me about my experience on a regular basis: the workouts, what I like, what I don't like, my results, etc. I feel like she tailors the workouts to me personally and that she truly cares about my progress.  Nobody here ever pressures you into buying heftier packages, adding on more sessions, purchasing supplements, etc. which is such a nice change of pace compared to most.  I would highly recommend Funktional Fitness for anybody looking for serious personal training, a fun environment to work out in a group setting, or even anybody looking to learn how to work out better and clean up their diet in order to maintain it on their own.

I am on a corporate membership so I pay for my year upfront and therefore do not ever have to deal with membership/payment/contract issues with this gym.  This particular location is a lot smaller and older than some of the new, huge, full service Mountainsides popping up. That being said, I really like the feel. It is less crowded, the classes do NOT fill up 20 minutes beforehand like many gyms I have been to and it is very low key. The personal trainers NEVER bother you to sign up, etc. etc. which is why I have stayed with Mountainside for so long. I can always get in, get my workout on, and get out without any issues of any kind.

This store is so cute. Always so organized & neat, and very reasonable prices. All of my garments from here have lasted for months through multiple wears, washings, & dry cleanings (which you can not always count on these days unless you pay high $) The woman who works mostly M-F during the day, I can't remember her name :( is so nice and helpful. Always informative regarding sales, etc. and I never feel pressured to buy things or spend $ I don't want to. Definitely check it out for cute, cheap (around $50 & below) dresses and darling accessories!

I went to RnR last week for brunch because one of my husband's good friends was in town visiting. It's one of the only places (that I know of) that you can get brunch and drinks during the week, which was exactly what we were looking for. I had the sundried scramble, it wasn't amazing but definitely good. I really liked the portion size, not minimal but not huge and overwhelming as it seems most places are these days. Next time I will definitely try something else as a lot of other menu items sounded really good to me. Our server was super nice and the place wasn't that crowded at all (so no negatives regarding the clientele from me). Husband loved his bloody mary made with the unique pepper infused vodka. I also really loved my cappuccino, so much that I had two. WAY better than Starbucks - and the coffee cups are so darling (I really wanted to steal one)!  We will definitely be going back for breakfast/brunch and to try out Happy Hour as well, the drink/food specials looked awesome!

This place sounded awesome, and I am always up for champagne, unfortunately I have absolutely nothing to base this review off of. My husband & I stopped in today after some shopping around 4 pm, there was only 3 other parties there. The hostess sat us on the patio, we were super excited to try some different champagnes and the weather was just perfect. We waited for 10 minutes and nobody ever came over to our table. We waited ten more minutes and still nobody. We decided to get up and leave and on our way out, absolutely nobody said anything to us. So needless to say, we won't be back and I have absolutely no idea how the drinks, food, or service is (besides completely non existent) :(

I've been here about 3-4 times since it's opening & each time the service has been consistently poor, tolerable but definitely below par. I have continued to go back hoping it was a "working the kinks" out situation & as they were open longer everything would fall into place - NO WAY. I will never go back. Our experience last night by far topped the list of mouth open this-is-so-ridiculous-I-can't-believe-it-is-actually-happening-in-real-life.   The menu says **ask about our gluten free beers** so I did & was informed the only gf beer was pear cider. Slightly annoyed because the menu is a little misleading.  After the bartender got our drinks, our actual server took forever to come to the table (even though she walked back & forth 3-4 times) We wanted a gluten free pizza so I asked her what size the gf crust was & she said 10 inches. We ordered 2 pizzas, asking for no cheese on both. We also "built our own salad" asking specifically if the green olives were pitted & ordered those - our salad come to the table with black olives. She came back to our table awhile later & sits down next to me (this may sound stuck up/prissy whatever but seriously, I don't know you & I did NOT come to hang out or sit by you  & I find it incredible tacky & invading to sit down without being asked just so you don't have to stand up while you talk with us) & says "do you have an allergy"  excuse me, what?  " do you have a gluten allergy? or are you just trying to be healthy or eat better or something because our crust is actually healthier, that gluten free crust has preservatives and eggs and its not healthy at all"  um again, excuse me?? I have 2 years of nutrition classes under my belt, have worked with acupuncturists, herbalists, quantum biofeedback specialists, naturopaths, and spend hours doing personal research, experiments, and reading of my own and YOU in 1 sentence are going to speculate on my food choices, make me feel self conscious & without any actual facts or data or education tell me that something is healthy & something else is not healthy for me. This is absolutely unacceptable in my eyes & downright rude.   She then goes on to explain that there are other aspects of the pizza's that aren't gluten free & we need to order off the gluten free menu, um HELLO?? Why is it that I am just being told about this menu now, wouldn't you have thought to bring to my attention there is a gluten free menu when I first asked about the gluten free crust?  She brings the menu and it says the crust is in fact 12 inches (didn't I just ask her this question & she said 10?)   so now we decide we only need 1 pizza & want to stick with the thai dye pie (I had heard its really tasty). She says its not on the gluten free menu & other things about it (not just the crust) have gluten. ok, so what are the other 'things'?   She checks and comes back and says the sauce.I ask what other sauces could be used and she says none, you need to order off the gluten free menu. seriously WTF at this point.  My husband doesn't want to go sauce-less because the pizza will be super dry so I say that's fine, I am sure a little sauce won't be a big deal for my stomach & I only plan on eating 1-2 pieces at most anyways.   Instead of just taking our order as is our server then responds w/ "do you have an allergy or not"  so rude, & most importantly, If she is going to go around giving health advice she should at least have a basic understanding of gluten, what it is, how it affects people, allergies, etc. gluten is not black & white, if you are allergic you don't eat one speck & break into convulsions like some people may from beans, peanuts, etc. It affects everybody differently ranging from malabsorption of nutrients, gas, bloating, headaches, leaky gut, etc. etc. - full blown celiacs have a much harder time & need to ensure no gluten is ever consumed, while some people just try to make prudent choices when available to limit the amount of adverse digestive problems that accompany consumption of gluten. There is also no reason why I should have to explain this, myself, or my choices to the server - especially when she is having a bad attitude.  She finally goes away and our pizza comes out (over 30 minutes later) w/ yep, tons of melted cheese all over the place.   We sent it back & when she came back told her what happened & said we wanted it togo, not only did she not apologize she didn't even say anything. We finally got the correct pizza & it was pathetic. There were barely any toppings & she had them put the sauce on the side, saying "she still didnt understand if we had an allergy or not" AAAAHHH!   While waiting for our check she sat down hugging the guy at the table next to ours carrying on personal conversations, etc.  helloooo??? we need our bill!   no coupons, no apologies, nothing. I was a server for 5 years & I would NEVER let my husband tip someone $0 but I was so upset we left the exact amount and got out of there as fast as possible.
