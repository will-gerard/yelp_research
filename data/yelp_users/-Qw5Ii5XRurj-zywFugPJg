I had an extremely pleasant experience with Carpet Corner. Annette showed us a ton of samples in the store and let us take our favorites home. She was extremely knowledgeable about all types of carpets and wasn't pushy when we wanted to stick to a strict budget. The carpet was installed on the day we were promised. Yes, they use a sub contractor but we had no issues with that. They came within the time frame they said they would and were in and out within a couple hours. (However, we did only have two rooms done) The carpet prices and installation were all very reasonable and less than we had been quoted with other places, especially for good quality carpet! I have nothing bad to say about this place and would definitely recommend to anyone!

I love this location! They are in Sun City so it makes sense they close early but I really wish they were open later. The staff is friendly and know me by name. Usually my drink is done before I'm done paying. Super quick and friendly. Love it!

If you'd like to have a horrible experience, leave feeling disappointed and sad, then this is the place for you!  First time bride coming in from out of town was looking forward to shopping for the biggest day of her life. We were disappointed to have a stylist that was anything but personable. Her name was Diamond but was lackluster and dull. She unexplainably started moving dresses as soon as we mentioned our budget. Her attitude completely changed and she even had the audacity to mention how she "wanted to go home" as she was fitting the bride into a gown. She offered no assistance to figuring out pricing and acted completely uninterested in helping the bride find the perfect dress. We ended up leaving early to go to a different bridal store where we were much more satisfied and catered to the bride to be as she should've been on such an important day.

5 stars based on great food, generous portions, cleanliness, prices and friendliness of staff.   I had the chicken teriyaki bowl which was delicious and definitely plenty of food. My boyfriend had the katsu chicken which had enough to take home and tastes great! We shared the egg rolls which were excellent as well.   My bowl was only $5 and out whole meal, including drinks was $20. We will be returning!

I've been going to ASU downtown for over a year but just tried this for the first time. While I wasn't expecting anything spectacular, I got it! The grilled chicken Caesar salad was DELISH. The chicken was flavored to perfection and was juicy, not dry like a lot of places can be. Because it's located on our campus, I wish the prices were lower for us broke college kids but you can't really complain when you get quality like this. The staff was also very nice and they had fun music playing. I will be frequenting this place more often now that I know what they have to offer. I'm excited to try their fresh smoothies and hummus next time!   -My only qualm with this place would be the to-go boxes. They're cute and convenient, until you go to eat out of it. Then the flaps get in the way. Not a huge deal though.

Jenna has a true gift for capturing the moment! She is fun, talented, patient and passionate about what she does and it is reflected in her work. I am always blown away by the work she does. She really makes you feel at ease during a session if you're not used to having your photo taken by a professional. I loved the photos she captured of my boyfriend and I at the lake near our house and I'm really looking forward to having her take my graduation photos in the coming months. Jenna is fantastic and never disappoints!

Stopped in for dinner last night as a first-timer.  Things I loved: Friendly staff! - The guy working there was quick to ask if we knew how to order. How you order - Customize your sandwich (lots to choose from) on a paper bag so you choose exactly what's on it. Cleanliness - Tables and floor were clean... until we got there. Oops! They had the World Series game on tv!  Things I wasn't so crazy about: Sandwich quality - It was GOOD but not great Price - For the price, I'd prefer something I think is GREAT, like Jersey Mike's (We paid $17 for 2 sandwiches and 1 drink)  They gave us a punch card with double punches, so for that reason, we will probably return. Otherwise, will probably stick to our usual sandwich spots

I'm sad to write this review based on the staff but due to the rude doormen, my whole mood was ruined and I sat down at the bar but started getting angry the more I thought about it and then left without even ordering. Just a tip, don't insult people before they even walk through your doors. That is NOT the way to treat someone willing to give you their money.  The decor was super cute and the menu looked interesting. If I'm ever in the neighborhood, I may reconsider trying this place but rude people really put me off.

I've eaten here a couple of times now and love it!   The restaurant: small but clean. Nothing to complain about. Eating in, they serve you the food on real plates with real forks. No disposable nonsense. I like that they have the tv on with a football game.   The food: I've tried several of the wraps and the cheesecake. I appreciate having a place to go to that has basically only healthy options. They try to allow you to make good choices with low carb tortillas and sides like veggies or salad. Even the cheesecake is NSA and therefore low carb. The food comes out fast and tastes fresh.   The service: the owner went out of her way to deliver to my work once, which was appreciated. The only complaint was that my salad was in the side container next to my hot wrap, so the salad was warm. I didn't eat it. Dining in was better for the saad. Anyway, the service was friendly and fast. No complaints.   No reason not to become a regular here, especially being located so close to home. And a groupon!
