When we checked in they were going to put us in a room with two double beds. I told the guy it was out anniversary and he found us a room with a queen bed. When we got to our room it was clearly a smoking from. Since it was already almost midnight we toughed it out. This morning I went down to the check in counter, explained we were in a smoking room and they moved us to a non smoking room with a king bed. We have to wait until this afternoon to move but still great customer service. The best was when I said thank you and apologized for being a pain, the woman helping me said "no problem! We are here to make you happy". So far everything has been awesome (except losing money gambling).

My wedding day was perfect, with the exception of USA Limousines. We signed a contact with USA Limousines to pick us up at 10:30 and we booked our car for one hour. Our resort was 30 minutes away. We we arrived outside at 10:45, the driver instructed us that he needed to charge us an additional $70 for the wait. We questioned this; $70 for 15 minutes? The driver said that he needed to charge us from 10:15 because that is when he arrived. We informed him that per the contract, which he had in his hand, he had been advised to pick us up at 10:30 and that we will still make it to our hotel room within the hour. The driver had us call the owner, Mike. Mike "swore on his mom and dad" that someone from our wedding party had instructed him to arrive at 10:15. No one in our wedding party had his number. He said that he spoke to Kristen. No one in our wedding party or at our venue is named Kristen. We were also the only one with his number  The driver was then instructed by the owner to leave us there. The driver opened the trunk, took our belongings, and threw them on the ground. He then drove off, tires squeeling, leaving us at our wedding venue with no options.   We had also booked a second vehicle as a surprise for our bridal party. The owner advised the bridal party limo's driver not to allow us in the vehicle at all.   The owner cussed at my husband and refused to talk to me.   One of my bridal party members ended up paying for the other limo that had arrived. Her name is also Kristy. Until the owner found out that she was not the bride Krysti, he was extremely rude to her.   Looking back on my wedding day, everything went perfect. It was the perfect day with the worst ending.   I cannot imagine a less professional, less integritable company to do business with and I do not recommend them to anyone.

Shannon did our flowers for our wedding and they were incredible. We came in with a particular budget in mind and a particular look we wanted to achieve. Our vision became a reality with her help.  The day of the wedding everyone commented on how unique the boutonniere's came out and how amazing the flowers were.  Thank you for everything you did for us Shannon!

Love this place! I tend to try to pick up breakfast here on my way to work once a week. Love the egg Sammie! Keeps me full but not uncomfortable full all day! I'd love to go into Lucy's when I'm not in a rush to work. Every time I am in there I find some new product that intrigues me.

Came for lunch today! Really good! I've been eyeballing this place since my coworker brought it back to the office last week. Had the carne asada chimi. Really tasty. The steak was perfectly cooked. No need to pay extra for sour cream or guac, although they put it on top. I prefer it on the side but that is just my preference. Next time I'll get it on the side. Chimi was perfectly crisp. Only real "complaint" I had was they laid the chimi on a bed of shredded lettuce, which was just in the way... Again something I am sure I can ask them to hold next time.

Always been a Jimmy Johns fan. Ordered tonight and there is a storm. They called to tell us they were running a bit slower than "freaky fast" and offered us free beverages. Very cool! So great to work with a company that cares about their customers and customer satisfaction. Fan of jimmy johns already but that was super legit.

This place is legit! Found it one day using the "wheel of lunch" and gave it a shot. One of my favorite lunch spots in central Phoenix. I always do two enchiladas with the 50/50 tortilla. I do a different meat in each (the chicken is one of my favs though). The red enchilada sauce is a little more smokey, the green is a perfect spice. I usually do my enchiladas Christmas style to have the best of both worlds.   One piece of advice is they are a pretty small establishment. During the lunch rush (which starts about 11:30) I usually go the takeout route.

This place is disgusting. The food is bland. No flavor at all. I should have kept driving and gone to McDonald's.   Also, The amount of bugs flying around is unacceptable. It makes me wonder what it is like in the kitchen. I spent my meal fighting off flies and other flying bugs (not sure what they were... Baby flies? Maggots with wings? Who knows?)   Overall disgusting experience and just waiting on the food poisoning to kick in.... I'm certain it is coming...  Only good thing is there are good beers...

I was really excited when I saw this place opening. Tokyo Joes was highly recommended by some friends in Colorado, where it originated. I was a tad disappointed. I had teriyaki chicken and it reminded me a bit of Kyoto Bowl... Which was not what I was expecting. It wasn't terrible, I just thought it would be different.
