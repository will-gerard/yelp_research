The service is decent, but the food leaves a lot to be desired. You can get a better burger, with exactly what you want on it, for a little less money at Fuddruckers a half mile west of here. You won't have a server to bring your burger and have to apply your own toppings, but that's a better setup in my opinion plus there is nobody to tip!

I really could not believe the quality of food for the price. I had the steak panini with gouda cheese instead of the bleu. The chipotle sauce is fantastic and the panini bread is just right, not too thick and toasted just enough to still be soft. I signed up for Yelp just to review this place. We will definitely be frequenting this place!

I should really write a review for this place since I eat here pretty much weekly for lunch. My coworkers and I have tried all the nearby gyro places and we all agree Mika's is the best. They even let me customize the Mediterranean like crazy (no tomato, no pickle, white pita, spicy tziki, spicy hummus). Our only gripe is we wish they made a chicken shawarma pita also, since we can't find a good one nearby and we know theirs would be the best. Very clean, nice digital menu boards and iPad registers, soothing new age music, and some of the best greek food in Tempe (especially for the price). Can't go wrong!
