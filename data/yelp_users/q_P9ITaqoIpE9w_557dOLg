My fiance and our friends always have a great time here. Girls are nice, place is clean, the popcorn is a plus! Scottsdale clubs are closer, but this place is worth the extra drive time.

Haven't been to this location, but was happily impressed. Newly redone inside from what my friend told me. Pizza is great as always - love the buttery crust. Wings are consistently among the top 3 on my list of good wings like in Arizona. Service was good, we got there early in happy hour so it wasn't too busy yet. Beer was good enough I had two tall ones - good selection on tap too :-)

Great customer service. They always treat you like they know you or at least remember who you are when you walk in. They'll beat anyone's advertised price and do it with a smile. They take appointments, which is a bonus. Mornings and weekends are usually super busy, especially during snowbird season.

First time ever getting my haircut at great clips. Good experience overall. Was greeted & seated promptly. Michelle cut my hair & did a very good job. My last haircut was at a salon & I paid $35. The $12 cut from Michelle was better than the $35 cut. I will definitely be going back every 4 weeks. Great cut especially for the price.

Best sonoran hot dog in Arizona. I've been to the places in Tucson and around the Phienix metro area. None of them come close. $2.50 for a meal in a bun, can't beat that. Cash only so plan ahead. The carne asada burrito is darn good too if you're not a hot dog fan.

Great meat, great prices. You cannot go wrong with any thing inside the walls of this Mesa gem. From the cannoli in the bakery, to the corn-fed beef & specialty Brats at the meat counter, everything is fresh & high quality.  Check out Midwestern Fitness for pre-made & measured whole food nutrition packs. Great for those of us who are health conscious and on the go.

Food is always very good. Cannot go wrong with their pizzas and usually they have a special pizza which has never failed either. Great pasta dishes, as well as sandwiches & soups.   Service is hit and miss. I eat lunch here often and sometimes my waitress seems to forget about me and other times she is very attentive to my 1 hour time frame.   The atmosphere is okay, It can be very loud during lunch and parts of the restaurant are dark and secluded.

Finally tried this place after many weeks of longing for a cronut. It is an old school neighborhood style donut shop. Several senior citizens in there that seemed to be regulars since the employee was sitting with them when I walked in. Promptly greeted and I told him it was my first visit. He gave me a run down on the favorite donuts.  I ordered the creme filled cronut and the cherry filled donut burrito. The cronut just might be the best pastry or donut I have eaten. Certainly earns a place in my top 5. I really enjoyed the cherry burrito. Basically a sweet tortilla filled with cherry filling and fried then glazed with donut icing. Quite the yummy departure from a normal breakfast pastry.  Service I thought was great. Very friendly and helpful. Good enthusiasm for the product and someone new to the store. I will definitely be back and have placed the 19th donut hole on my regular rotation of donut shops on the east valley. Enjoy!!!

Poor service - slow, confused, language barrier. "Happy hour" was extremely limited in terms of drink & food. No sushi or sashimi on happy hour, only several rolls. Overpriced for what we ordered. 3 rolls, tempura shrimp, and two drinks was $45 - everything was off the happy hour menu except 1 drink. We actually left & finished our happy hour/dinner at blue wasabi San tan mall. Will not be back to Got Sushi.

Went for lunch with my wife who works in the area. The place was loud & crowded. We waited 10 minutes to be seated and the service went downhill from there. I ordered a beer, server asked for my ID, which I handed him, and he ran off with it (I assumed to check it). 5 minutes later he returns with my ID but not my beer! I finally got my beer shortly after.   The food is overpriced and marginal at best. It seems like it is a place to go to be seen as long as you don't care about mediocre food at a Biltmore district price.   When we were ready to leave, we waited for the bill. Then waited some more. Then more waiting. The group of 4 next to us at the table was in the same boat - where is our server & our bill? I finally got up, walked over to the manager & asked for our bill and the bill for the party next to us. He of course apologized. We paid, which took the server way too long to process, and left.   I will not be back & I doubt the party next to us will be either.

Best banh mi sandwich in Arizona. Wish I lived closer, but it is worth the trip on the weekend for a delicious, fresh, authentic banh mi. French horns are to die for, get there when they open and they will still be a little warm. Cash only!

As a lover of BBQ, I cannot believe it took me 6 years of living in Arizona to find this gem. My girlfriend and I went here after much anticipation on a Sunday afternoon and we were blown away. This is not only THE best BBQ you can get in Arizona, but the service and ambiance are second to none.   We shared the Whole Hog feast and had enough left over for a late night snack. The cornbread was the most amazing, moist, sweet corn cake I have tasted. Beef ribs?  Amazing, tender, juicy, beefy. Baby Backs? Fall off the bone and meaty, Pulled Pork? Juicy, smokey, melt in your mouth. Brisket? Full of sweet smoke and seasoning. I got an order of burnt ends to take home and the knocked my socks of with the seasoning and smoke - YUM!!!  The manager came by our table and chatted with us for a bit about our meal. She gave us a little history on how Booby Q's came to be. Later, our server came by and informed us we could pick any dessert we wanted - compliments of the manager. We picked the mud pie - again THE best I've ever had. At this point in the meal we were not surprised by the amazing-ness of the dessert. Wow! Hard to find service and attention to the customer like that anymore.   All in all this is now in my top 3 favorite places to not just eat, but to dine in Arizona. In my opinion, a 5-star dining experience should cater to all 5 senses - Bobby Q's did just that. If I could give a bonus star, I would. If you have not been to this restaurant, stop searching Yelp right now and make plans to go. You will NOT be disappointed.

Our favorite movie theater & its super close to our home. Always clean. Always very friendly. Plenty of screens & showtimes for whatever movie you want to see. Comfy rocking seat backs, even for someone as tall ad me @ 6'6".  We don't always go out to the movies, but when we do....we go to Harkins Superstition Springs.

Dan is the owner and is always there, ready to help anyway he can. Easy to work with and his crew is friendly and they do great work. We have had 3 windsheilds replaced by Fast Glass. I am a big believer in supporting local small businesses - especially when they do such a good job!!!   Thanks Dan and crew!

Still one my favorite breakfast places in the east valley. Finally got some friends to stop settling for the chain breakfast places & try Cozy Corner. Needless to say, no more chain places for them. I go here about 4x month with friends and/or clients. Great service, consistently good, simple breakfast at a very good price. Biscuits & gravy are comfort food done right - fluffy biscuit & creamy sausage gravy. Pecan waffle is a must try!!!

Bad experience after not having been to a Red Robin for a couple years. Took 10nin for our server to come take drink order, another 5min to get water and a beer.  Ordered two burgers, both were okay and somewhat bland. My fiance's burger was severely undercooked. She sent it back to get one done with 'some pink' as originally ordered and it came back very 'well done' with zero pink.  Server was unapologetic and lethargic at best. Manger did take one burger off the tab, so at least they did that correctly. Took 15min after clearing table to get our bill.   Will not be back to Red Robin for another 2 years.

It's a junkyard. It's close-ish to my home.  Usually has what I need and prices are always negotiable :)  Talk to Chupacabra if you need specific items pulled or big items, slip him a couple bucks and he'll get it done for you.

Had the Chimichanga - excellent. Then ordered up a Sonoran Hot Dog - it was also excellent. It thought it was a fast food type place, but it took a good 15 min to get my food - a testament to the freshness & quality of the food. I will be back and take my friends to experience a Sonoran Hot Dog.

Nasty. Better off going to Panda Express. It's just sloppy, greasy, and bland. Not to mention that they forgot an entire entree for our take-out order, which we didn't find out until we got home. The old folks around superstion springs probably love it - cheap and bland.

Close to my house otherwise I'd never go here. It's fine if you're happy standing in line waiting for the senior citizens to figure out how to work the debit card. They rarely have more than 1 register with open even in the middle of the day. Cashiers are nice and polite but have no sense of urgency when they have 5 people in their line waiting.  If you only need a few items and can get them at a convenience store/gas station - go there and save some time and frustration. Otherwise I'd choose a different grocery store. This one is snowbird and senior citizen central. All the 'homes' have regular drop-offs there.

A good little Sushi joint not far from our house. Good specials and overall pricing. Every bit as good as an expensive Scottsdale Sushi Bar, without the additional strain on the wallet.   Las Vegas roll, soft shell crab appetizer and the baked mussels are always good choices.

Good sushi, especially for east mesa. Service is notoriously and consistently poor. 15min for water, 45min for any food, 5min for beer. These are standard tines, not based upon 1 visit. Sometimes you're not sure if you server completely forgot about you. Only reason we go is it is close, decent food, and really the best quality sushi near us that we've tried. Just realize the service will be bad if you go and don't expect greatness.

By far our favorite restaurant in the Valley of the Sun. The owners are always there and treat everyone that comes in as if they are friends & neighbors.  We took my Uncle from San Francisco here when he visited, he said it is as good or better than any Vietnamese  place in the Bay Area. My Aunt is from Southeast Asia & he served in Vietnam, so he is no stranger to the cuisine. We eat here at least once a week.

Umm...Banana Bread French Toast. That is all I have to say. This place ROCKS! The burgers and sandwiches are very good also. It is Scottsdale so the prices are probably 10% more than a similar place anywhere else. Great place to grab breakfast before a Spring Training game. Go Giants!

Great dogs, polishes, and brats. The brats really hit the mark of a mid-west style brat with saurkraut and mustard. The Chicago style dog is among the best I have had anywhere. Chili cheese dog? Pretty dang good and probably my favorite thing to get when I go here. Gotta get a root beer float too. Glad this place is only a couple miles from home!  Cash only as stated before, but the prices are really reasonable. Don't bother with the corndog - tastes like the ones you get at Costco.

One of our local favorite hangouts. Fajitas are very good, pollo rico is amazing. Always plenty of chips and salsa. The perfect storm margarita is one of the best margaritas I've had north of the Mexican border, period. Above average Tequila selection, especially for a place that is restaurant first and bar second. Wait staff is friendly and prompt, but don't always know the menu. Manager is very good and often comes by to check on guests or drop off a complimentary shot of anejo ;)

Usually cheaper fuel than QT up the street. Easy in/out with plenty of pumps. I'm a regular so staff is always friendly to me but they generally are upbeat and move quick enough to get people through the line. Wish they had a better selection of Xyience energy drinks. Overall its my go to convenience store/gas station unless I want donuts or corn dogs, then I go up the road ;)

Our dogs love it here. The staff is always friendly and welcoming. Knows our dogs even if its been a little while. We take two of them for grooming and they come back clean, pretty, and happy every time. Our Am Staff we have boarded here and she does great. It's hard to find a pet resort that is truly bully breed friendly and doesn't make you pay a ridiculous price just because of the breed.

Best BBQ in the east valley without a doubt. Yes, better than Joe's, Waldo's, Dickie's, Dave's, or any others we've been to. Family owned & operated. Brisket, pulled pork, and sausage are all yummy, moist, and just enough smoke without overpowering the meat. Price point for their food is commensurate with just about every non-chain BBQ joint in the valley.  After dinner comes one of the best kept secrets at this fantastic little BBQ joint - the homemade pecan pie! The owners wife makes the pie from scratch. As a lover of pecan pie, I have had many & believe me this one is the best. I asked about buying whole pies & they do sell whole pies as well, yippie!   If you love BBQ & have not tried Allison's...it is well worth the trip. Fortunately for us, we live very close to this great restaurant.

We were introduced to this place about 3 months ago and we are now regulars. The Hub is in the top 3 of our favorite restaurants in the Valley. Top notch service, amazingly consistent and delicious food, great atmosphere, and it's only 2mi from our house. I'd recommend a menu item to try, but honestly they are all great. The smoked wings are THE best wings I have ever had. I can eat them by the pound (Wednesday is the wing special btw).   If you haven't been here, you are missing out on great food and a rare dining experience that many "fancy" restaurants can't even come close to matching. Ask for Audree, she is our favorite server. Chances are Chris, the manager, will come by and chat as well. Say hello and enjoy!  Oh yeah, kids get to go to the 'Treausre Chest' after the meal to pick out a toy. Usually Hot Wheels, Barbie, princess stuff, etc; Definitely kid friendly!

I generally enjoy Jimmy John's and this place is literally 1 mi from my house, which are the only reasons I continue to give this location business. The employees are mentally very slow and they have screwed up my sandwich on several occasions. I don't order anything difficult either, usually just no tomato and sometimes I request mayo on a slim. NOT VERY COMPLICATED STUFF.   It's Jimmy John's. It's relatively fast and cheap. Liek the saying goes "Fast, Cheap, Good. Pick two, cause you'll rarely find all three. I dread going in to order just because I can feel the level of "idiot" in that place and it's stressfull.

I have been to every self-serve fro-yo place in the east valley except this one. Well...I finally went due to my usual place having broken machines when I was trying to get my 'fix'.   Let me just say that Zoyo has the best flavors and the most original flavors. I got the Raspberry Pomegranate Tart and their Chocolate. I tried flavors such as Watermelon Sorbet, Aloha, and Salted Caramel. All were delicious and I can't wait to go back for more.   The pricing is average I think .45/oz and they have all the toppings you might expect. Actually the only topping I wish they had but they didn't was fruity pebbles or fruit loops.   Anyway, this is my new favorite fro-yo spot and even better that it is a little closer to my home. Break away from your usually fro-yo spot and give them a try. BTW...Dunkin' Donuts is right next door.... :)

Was helped by Amii & was very happy all around. Switched from iPhone to Android and made a lot of changes to my plan. Surprisingly easy & had me in/out in about an hour.  Helped by someone else when my fiance went to change phones/plans & it was not the same. My 5-star rating is because of Amii. We went back in a week later & she was there. Got us squared away with a smile & a very good knowledge of her product s & services.

Pretty darn good food, if you're after a fresh burger, fries, cheese, and the like. The Concrete mixers (think blizzard with custard) are to die for. This place puts DQ or any other fast food place to shame. I love going here for my 'cheat meal' once a week...or sometimes twice :)

I am so lucky this place is 2 miles from my house. Every pie I have tried is amazing. The green chili pork pot pie is to die for. Lemon Sour Cream Blueberry is probably my favorite, followed by the Apple Crumb. Staff is super friendly and patuent while you try to choose from the over 30 options. Best pies in in tha Valley without a doubt!

Having grown up and lived in California and Oregon, I am used to WINCO and very happy to have one relatively close to my home. Good prices, great produce and meats, and love the bulk foods section. It's often less expensive than Walmart and unlie Costco, you don't have to buy 100 units of whatever you need.

Was referred here by a couple of my military friends. They promised me I'd get a good fade but I was still skeptical. I took their advice and was very happy I did. Isaac cut my hair & he did a great job. Best haircut I've had since I moved to AZ in 2005.  The place is all setup for guys complete with TV's and comfy leather chairs. Might even get a cold beer if you ask ;)  Overall a great experience & I will drive the 45min each way from east Mesa every month to get my haircut.

poor service, took 10 minutes to get water. Never got refilled. Food was slightly more interesting than IHOP or Denny's but about the same quality. Great place to go after a night of drinking I suppose. We won't be back, just wasn't impressed.

Just joined a week ago. So far so good. Staff is friendly, trainers sem to know more and act more professional than a lot of other gym chains, and the equipment is more than adequate. I actually joined for the heavier dumbells that I couldn't find at LA Fitness or 24hr Fitness near my home. Happy with Fit Evo overall. $20/month includes everything - even unlimited tanning!

Definitely going the way of the big corporate fitness club chains since change of management/ownership. Becoming pushy, sales driven, and gimmicky. Manager seems to think telling the trainers to wear their orange shirt is more important than smiling, talking to members, or tidying up the facility as he walks by water bottles & used paper towels. What's more is the two trainers that never wore the orange shirt are both female & in very very good shape. I'd think its better marketing for them to show that they 'walk the walk' to clients/members/potential clients.   Still get a good workout here (equipment hasn't changed), but the overall vibe is changing fast and not for the better. My girlfriend trains with a trainer there a few times a week & I can tell you when employees aren't happy as they once were, it permeates. Only thing that changed was ownership & management. Good thing I kept my LA Fitness membership. I heard pricing changed too but cannot confirm.

Very brand new and still clean. The cleaning crew actually does a good job and stays active throughout the day (I go at various times depending on the day). The staff is the usual for LA Fitness, from my experience - not very smart or friendly. Rarely greeted with a smile or hello and NEVERsaid goodbye or have a good day to when leaving. They just scan your card and say "Thanks". Trainers are typical large-chain trainers - limited knowledge surrounding actual  fitness, lurking around the gym or hanging at their desk instead of helping someone who needs a pointer, and generally just bad sales people.   It a gym, I have a couple other memberships to gyms in the Vallety so I don't have to go here all the time. The best thing is the newness and cleanliness. You get what you pay for and don't expect much more.

Very happy to be back at this gym after joining a competitor for a year. Staff seems stable & competent. Members are the only complaint due to being spoiled yuppies that don't feel the need to put their own weights away, but oh well.   Great facility. Cleanliness I'd give an 8/10 as sometimes there are used paper towels or water bottles that don't get picked up from the day before (I go in twice a day). Has all the equipment most people need. I wish they had heavier dumbells but I make due with other exercises. Good music & good atmosphere whether morning or evening.   Definitely recommend this location. Sales guy Chris was helpful & not pushy. Signed my fiance up & her mother is joining soon too.

Great location, right next to Chase Field and right in front of a light rail stop. The atmosphere is an upscale/trendy sports bar. Plenty of TV's if you can't get into the game. The food is amazing. Mac n cheese with chicken is a must, along with their Lobster bisque that is more like a chowder with chunks of lobster in it. Burgers were dynamite -  juicy inside, slighty crisp outside, with bacon and bacon mayo (Holy Bacon burger). Nice briosche bun that they brand teh top of with 'CC'.  The bar and drinks is top shelf. Drink menu is creative, all named after a major league baseball team. My fiance drank the 'Cincinnati' all night, named Pete's Punch after Pete Rose. I had beer and teh El Pres margarita made with Herradura reposado and a side blanco shot.  The staff is friendly and fun. we spent 5 hours there on Saturday night and never were rushed or hurried. Everyone was smiling and having a good time. Our waitress stayed and talked with us for a while even when we were just winding it down before driving home. We can't wait to go back and share this place with friends!!

Food is average, but cheap. Usually quick in/out if you are wanting sushi without spending your weekly allowance.   Service is awful. No, it is worse than awful. If it were any worse, it would be because they had no employees....actually that might improve service.   We go here often because it is close, cheap, and satisfies the crave for sushi on a weeknight when you don't feel like fast food.  Did I mention service is bad??? Cause it is BAD.

Finally a Freddy's right near my house! Love their steakburgers & grilled hotdogs. Fries are great too. The best best best frozen custard in the east valley IMO. So delicious! Very friendly staff at all locations and good service. If you've never had a steakburger, try Freddy's first. If you've never tried Freddy's steakburger, what are you waiting for???
