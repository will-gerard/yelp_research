I work in the building across the street and have gone here for lunch too many times to count.  If I didn't work in the building across the street I doubt I would have ever gone into this corner building, strip mall, dive bar unless something horrific was happening in the world, such as the zombie apocalypse, one in which I'm being chased by a hoard and my only salvation is to enter a dive bar where, more than likely, the servers will also be zombies and I'll be fucked pretty bad.   That said, the place kind of smells like musk and sadness and the two or three middle aged servers look like they've lived a lot of life.  There are always a few hunched over dudes at the bar, watching sports or maybe counting their misfortunes.  One server appears to have always just had something weird or traumatic happen to her before she takes our order, like she was just bitching at SRP for shutting her power off or she just found out her teenage son got arrested on drug charges- then she comes to take our order.  While the service has never been despicable, we always have to wait an unnecessary amount of time for our tab, which sucks since we're anxious to get back to our meaningless jobs.  She also asks us "what flavor" of beer we want, which confused me since, like, Blue Moon is not exactly a "flavor" as much it is, you know, a brand.  But I can look past this.    I've eaten a few things here and the worst and most unacceptable was a simple dinner salad which was literally wilted Iceburg, bag lettuce with an obscene amount of dressing.  I can only assume that they thought if they covered the wilted lettuce with enough fatty Ranch I wouldn't notice the lettuce was bad.  I did, but I didn't send it back, instead I ate it and drank beer and talked about how much better the director's cut of Bladerunner is.   The wings are mediocre, not crispy enough for me to say they're cooked well, not thick enough to call them plump, and not tasty enough to assume that the sauce is anything more than some Frank's Red Hot concoction with some added butter or someshit.  I've also had the pleasure of the chicken "fritters" which are, you know, frozen chicken strips deep fried.  I order these most times I come here because they can't really fuck it up and you can't exactly go wrong with chicken strips.  I've also ordered the "fire" fries which are just their fries with Cayenne pepper on them, and they charge another 1.50 for this.   What IS worth the trip across the way and the shady, low brow atmosphere are the two dollar burgers on Tuesdays.  I actually never order the burgers only because I'm not much of a burger person, but my regular co-workers tell me they're tasty, a cut above a fast food burger and cheaper.  (Though, consider that you're also leaving a tip for the service, not getting fries, and paying extra for cheese, so it's not THAT much of a better deal than fast food, just sayin'.)   What I can't look past, why Dirty Drummer is only getting two stars, is the fact that the only reason we came here; the five dollar pitchers of domestics, are now, for some reason, NINE dollar pitchers which, needles to say, is absolutely not worth it, especially considering the skimpy size of the pitchers, the depressing atmosphere and the tore up servers.  After my co-worker noticed this new four dollar addition to the pitcher price he said, rather cleverly, "looks like this is the last time we'll be drumming."  And it was.

For some reason, probably a reason associated with heavy drinking habits and/or retardation, I can't ever remember the name of this place.  Since I'm unable to, whenever I bug my coworkers to go there I simply make up a new name for it.  For example:  "hey guys, we should go to old Mcdonalds house of Brass Railroad Tracks."  or  "Hey, lets go to Brass Traintrack Rails at noon."  Since most of my coworkers have not been afflicted with heavy drinking habits and/or retardation they know what I'm talking about.  I sought this place out as a lunch time place during work hours since often I crave a simple beer for lunch instead of caloric "food."  Usually my fellow workers and I will end up at the Dirty Drummer, since it's right across the street from our office building.  This was fine for a while until I realized that The Dirty Drummer is actually fucking gross, the atmosphere is depressing and the servers are visually annoying.  Thanks to my obsession with Yelp and alcohol, I was able to find this little gem, a simple and tasty dive bar that is literally four minutes from our office.    Old Brass Rail is large and not at all intrusive, it's not so local that everyone looks at you when you walk in and it's not so detached that they don't care that you're there.  Plus, they have those high top bar tables that are fun to sit at, especially when they're spread out and you don't have to hear other people's conversations.  They have a million flat screen TV's for when the conversation slows or when you dine with boys who are distracted by lights and moving objects around them.  I've only been there twice, both times we had the same server, both times all my comrads ordered the amazingly reasonable and genius idea of a three dollar breakfast until 2 p.m.  Everyone loves breakfast, and to serve a cheap breakfast at a BAR until 2 p.m. is god damn fucking brilliant.  The server was super nice, sweet and friendly, remembered us, offered suggestions, was not put off by the fact that we are an unlikely group to be at bar in the middle of a weekday.  I can honestly say that both times I thoroughly enjoyed my Old Brass Railroad Tracks experience.   I didn't order breakfast because I am not a "breakfast food" person.  I order lunch, even in the morning.  I ordered the chicken strips and a salad, I've also had the fries.  Everything was what you expect as far as bar food but genuinely not gross, with the added bonus that it was NOT, in fact, The Dirty Drummer.  Also, it's not over priced for what it is, 7 for an app, 7 for a burger, cheap beers, good specials, 4.50 pitchers, such a great find.  Also, 3.50 breakfast AT A BAR- GENIUS.  In addition to the totally acceptable food, pleasant service and good prices, you get the added bonus of checking out an old school cigarette vending machine on your way out.  I hope to return to Train Tracks of Brass Railroad Bar soon.

I'm not a BBQ snob, I'm not from the South, I don't know what things are called when you add coleslaw to them, I don't have a pit in my backyard.  Yet, my love affair with pork runs deep, to the bone, kinda like how I love my grandma but pork isn't racist, so it's almost MORE pure.  I've even been known to cook pork myself, braise it, slow cook it, dance with it.   Hap's pulled pork sandwiches are god damn awesome, I don't care what anyone says.  The pork is perrrfectly cooked, tasty, mounted on some nondescript buns and served in easy-to-open foil inside a brown paper bag of wonderful.  I've never eaten anything else here, and I probably never will.   I also like the quaint atmosphere and how it's always busy enough at lunch time for you to know it's good, but not so busy that it takes an hour to get in and out of there.  Another thing I like about Hap's is that they take down you first name and call it out when your food is ready.  This may seem menial, but it adds a bit of personability to a place which I always can appreciate.  My co-workers have gotten the pulled chicken and beef and all that other stuff and they too share my love for this great lunch time spot.  The only negative I will say about Hap's is that every time I eat it I want to take a nap right after; which isn't so bad considering I have a job in which sleeping could be considered MORE productive.

This is a to-go wing place with a DRIVE THRU.  Yeah, man, you can just, like, drive through and get a dozen wings.  The added bonus to this not-having-to-get-out-of-your-car trend is that the wings are actually not bad.  They're not restaurant style phenomenal, but they're descent for the price.  I prefer the honey hot since the extra hot are more like mild to me, so I go for flavor.  They're tiny little wings, like half the size of an Oregano's wing, but the sauce is essentially tasty and again, YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET OUT OF YOUR CAR.   I've never eaten there, and I probably never will. The place is uncomfortable and muggy, always turned to the Spanish channel or Fox news on the little TV's.  What I noticed about this place is that calling in an order ahead of time doesn't matter, they still don't cook it until you get there.  Which is fine, but sort of odd.  In fact, I feel as though I've waited LONGER when I call in an order rather than just gone to the drive through.   The fries are not bad, but you have to salt them yourself because I don't think they salt them.  Also fine, but sort of odd.  The service is usually prompt and helpful though the employee appears to be a 13 year old boy.  Fine, yet odd.   This is not a bad place for some cheap, tasty to-go wings and also, man, YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET OUT OF YOUR CAR.  In honor of this, sometimes my comrad and I just sit in the car and eat our wings to see how disgusting and white trashy we can get.

Sometimes I get really drunk and want the Filiberto's Super Nachos.  Filly B's Super Nachos consist of tortilla chips with some salsa, cheese, beans and then A SHIT LOAD, like, seriously, at least three full cups, more than you'll ever eat, of low quality, delicious beef.  Most times I've eaten them I am black out drunk and did something more stupid than eating Filiberto's Super Nachos, like punching my boyfriend in the face.  These nachos are literally the only reason I do those two or seven extra shots sometimes.  When I leave Phoenix, Filiberto's Super Nachos (I order them with no sour cream so they're totally healthy) are going to be in the top three things I miss; right after racist sheriffs and your mom.

Gus' was created by a person I assume was like, "hey man, college kids get drunk, can't drive, and want pizza delivered at all hours of the night."  Thus, there is this crap hole pizza place that is run by the mentally challenged.  At my high school it was the special ed kids that always served our lunches in the cafeteria, then all those kids moved to Tempe and got a job here.  The biggest problem with this place is that the staff is totally careless and incompetent and I imagine on some or all drugs during work.   Actually, that's a lie, the biggest problem is the pizza is gross.  It tastes like when you make a frozen Tombstone pizza at night, take it out, then you don't want it anymore so you leave it on the counter instead of wrapping it up cause you want to get back to watching Hoarders on A&E.    Then you wake up the next morning and you're like, "oh, cool, left over frozen Tombstone pizza that's been sitting out all night."  So you put it in the microwave to nuke all the bacteria and get it out of the temperature danger zone.  Then you eat it and you're like, "wow this tastes JUST like Gus' Pizza only slightly better."

Perhaps I'm over stating Casey Moore's charm, but this has to be my favorite bar in the valley.  I love the energy, I love the low key, unpretentious, anti-normalcy crowd.  I love the beautiful outdoor seating, the little pond in the corner, the hanging lights, the giant trees, the drink specials, the Guiness on draft.  I always bring out of town folks to Casey Moore's because you can order anything on the perfectly sized menu and you know it's going to be descent.  The boyfriend always orders the oysters and the price for a half dozen is solid and affordable and I don't even mind watching him slurp them down as long as I have a nice buzz from one or two Harps.   I think I've ordered every appetizer and never been disappointed.  Also, even their prices when it's NOT happy hour are super cheap, 6 bucks for a dozen wings, that's totally perfect.  The service isn't extraordinary, but I don't mind waiting since I'm fond of the ambiance and enjoy people watching amongst the interesting crowd.  The chicken strips are awesome, the salads are good and never wilted or over dressed, the fish and chips are on par, the fries are always good; you can't beat anything for the price and the atmosphere.  I've been here for my birthday, taken out of town friends here, brought my mom and brother here when they were in town, had a million happy hours here and just can't seem to find anything I hate about it.  Oh, I hate when it's hot and we can't sit outside.   Casey Moore's is charming, cheap, serves above average bar food and essentially is an all around quality bar in the middle of Tempe.

The boyfriend and I went here on a Sunday morning hung over from Four Lokos.   The food was fucking great and I don't even like breakfast food.  I got this egg and jalapeno burrito thing with this sort of runny but generally pretty tasty salsa and I wanted to shower in the burrito filling.  I would have bathed in eggs and salsa if only to prolong my experience with this semi-breakfast burrito thing.  I would have married it and had kids with it and bought a house in Michigan nearby a really good school district.  I fell in love with the egg jalapeno burrito thing, I would cuddle with it on weekday mornings and plan trips to national parks with it.    It was also nice sitting on the patio considering the weather is so pretty and the staff was attentive and friendly and slightly charming with their loafers and novelty socks (is that part of the required uniform I wonder?)  I'm deducting one star for the sheer fact that this place was filled with rich, middle aged white yuppies talking about golfing and/or glued to their cell phone.  The boyfriend and I, being young dirty Mesa kids still slightly intoxicated off Four Lokos, felt mildly out of place in this setting and were a little over whelmed by the amount of yuppie whiteness.  Nonetheless, the food was worth the trip and the cozy patio on a Sunday morning was a nice change from, you know, Cheerios on the futon while watching exercise equipment infomercials.

At Oregano's, you will hear that same Louis Prima song on repeat during your entire dining experience, but at least you'll get good service.   Actually, I pretty much love Oregano's for their Aunt Shirley's Gorgonzola pizza an order of their nice, meaty wings with mixed sauce.  Oregano's is one of the only places I've been to that allows you to mix their wing sauces.  I love the Italian Gold wings there, a little sweet, honey-ish, salted perfectly, but I also like the Wings of Fire, the hottest selection there.  But get this, if you ask them, they'll mix the two sauces together, so you get this awesome giant, meaty wing covered in this brilliant sweet and spicy sauce.  It's sort of like sex but only a chicken wing.   I feel like I hear people bitch about the price a lot but to me, it's pretty much perfect for what you get.  It's a littler pricier than a place like Streets of New York, but the service and food is better, it's a little less than somewhere like Pizzeria Bianco or Le Grande Orange, but again, it's a little less, you know, delicious as those places.  It's also a great place to take out of town folk since it's a local chain, yet always consistent and generally there is something everyone will like.  Personally, I don't mind the long waits for a table on the weekends.  Once, I brought an uncle and cousin I hadn't seen in years there and it was actually sort of nice grabbing beers from the bar and catching up while we waited for our table.  In any dining setting, I doubt mind waiting as long as something delivers.   Which the place does.  If you can handle the Louis Prima.

While I can appreciate the appeal of having a disinterested, gay, hipster server who is probably really good at bullshitting about wine, I found the overall ambiance and service sort of off putting.    The boyfriend and I waited a good ten minutes before someone came over to take our drink order though I noticed the server eying our table long before then.  I imagine he thought perhaps we were NOT, in fact, disinterested, gay hipsters who could bullshit about wine but rather low-end Mesa kids tired of slumming it at the local dive so we thought we'd treat ourselves to someplace awful nice like The Vig.  Except, The Vig is only "meh."  The burger is worth it for five bucks on Monday, the fries are awesome, the drink specials are mediocre, the atmosphere I found a bit stuffy and unfriendly, the menu is all over the place with no solid direction or theme and the "totally modern, contempo art deco" bullshit bathrooms make me roll my eyes while I pee.  I got a couple vodka sodas and they were lacking in the "alcohol" department which is sort of the only reason I order them.  They were also served in some stupid, pretentious glass.   Overall, the experience seemed dark (maybe cause there were no windows) and sort of awkward and I found myself wanting to leave pretty quickly.    I can appreciate some hip little lounges where people go out to be seen and maybe pretend that the food is amazing; but The Vig is like the douche bag dude you see driving a BMW with his top down even though it's 6 a.m. and 20 degrees outside.  I assume his account is overdrawn and his girlfriend says she's an artist but really she's a server at Oregano's.  I think what it is though, and I realized this as I scoffed at the sparkling silver, super modern sink fixtures in the woman's bathroom (with a door cleverly labeled with a giant "W" for women? get it? "W" is for women), that mostly I'm just a stiff drinks-cheap-food-sticky floors-tore-up-waitresses dive bar girl at heart.

I dated a chef for five years.  I learned how to chop onions and find good places to eat and act smug when we got sent special food out.  About three years into our relationship she helped open up Much Gusto.  She was a "creative consultant" for the menu and our roommate was the restaurant manager.  We also knew the chef she was working with and I often recall this chef as I dine there, who once told me a story with his thick Mexican accent about doing shrooms in Mexico and then burning all of his pants.  She only helped open the place, working ridiculous hours for about a month, and then when the kitchen and menu were in order she moved on.   Even after she moved on from the opening, Mucho was a go-to place for a while.  Out roommate ran the place so one holiday when the restaurant was closed we got to go in there and cook our holiday meal in their kitchen, partake in the bar goods and act like big shots having the place to ourselves.  I have a million memories of staying after hours around the fire, on the patio, drinking vodka tonics and talking about food and music and people.  These are fond memories, so perhaps my review of the place as a current dining experience might be biased.  But I don't care, I'll always love Mucho.   This was many years ago, I believe the owner is the same but the menu has changed, the chef has changed and we've been broken up for many years; she slings food at FnB and I date boys now instead of girls.  What's odd though is that despite it being a spot which was a staple in my past life with her it has upheld the test of time and become one of the boyfriend and I's favorite places for good food and tasty margaritas.   The best thing you can order at Mucho are the flautas.  These are absolutely perfect; juicy and spicy and perfect with this tangy, thick sauce that kills me every time.  We also never fail to order the Quaso, as melted cheese with tortillas are just perfect in making you feel fat but also releasing two millions endorphins.  Most times we visit Mucho we split an order of the Quaso and an order of flautas and it's the perfect amount of food.  The margaritas are always well prepared and it's worth it to have like four if you go for happy hour.  The salsa is actually spicy and the bus boys are way better at refilling your empty chip bowl than the servers.    Another thing I love about Mucho is that they play good music.  It may seem menial, but the stupid mainstream bullshit music that makes its way into most upscale-yet-not-fine-dining places is repetitive, crappy and mostly annoying.  I've heard Mucho play some bands I wouldn't normally expect to hear in such a place, and am always surprised and pleased by it.  As in, "holy shit they're playing old school Modest Mouse.  Weird."  The only complaint I have about Mucho is, of course, the service.  It's true what the other reviewers say, the service is slow, all the hot chicks that work there seem a little dumb, and you always have to wait forever for more drinks and sometimes they just plain forget.  Usually when we go to Mucho we're planning on hanging out for a while so it's not such a huge deal to wait, but I can understand how it gets annoying.    They need to stop hiring hot chicks and hire some smart people instead.   Recently, I went to Mucho for my 25th birthday, probably about five years after my first visit to the opening, and ate on the patio with a couple of close friends and partook in a cozy and memorable dining experience.  But like I said before, I'm biased.

Asian Cafe Express gets five stars because it is the ONLY take out Asian food I ever get.  I've tried other places, and nothing compares, so when you find something this awesome and affordable with the best twice cooked pork in the world, you don't stray.   I keep an Asian Cafe Express menu in my kitchen drawer and I mark each thing I've tried with a smiley face, a sad face, or one of those faces that just have a line for a mouth (those ones represent "okay").  May I note though, that nothing is bad, it's all about personal preference, the stuff that got a sad face was never because it was bad, it was just because it wasn't really my bag.  The twice cooked pork is arguably the best thing in the world.  I would put this twice cooked pork up against five star restaurants, that asshole with those cooking shows on Fox, or maybe even some Eastern religion's God.  I get it every time I go there and when I leave this city I will travel great distances to have it again.   Also worth traveling for is the General Chicken w/ Sweet and Chili Sauce, this has just the right about of sweet and spice with nice, well cooked, perfectly prepared chicken stuffed in one of those awesome Asian take out food boxes.  In fact, all of the chicken dishes are pretty good, that goes for the fried rice too, ESPECIALLY the pork fried rice which I would shower in if I could.   I've tried most of the appetizers as well and my favorites are the Chili Sauce Dumplings and the spring rolls.  There's nothing fancy about them, they're just always the perfect companion to your meal.  The only complaint I ever had was with the Chili Salt Chicken Wings which, while still better than a lot of gross shit I've had, were SOOO salty I could hardly eat them.   Also notable the Lo Mein, the totally affordable and always delicious Family Dinner Pack in which you get an obscene amount of food for 20 bucks, the adorable and prompt staff, the way they give you large orders in boxes so it's easier to carry, the seeded Chili sauce they provide on all the tables, the consistency of it, and also the twice cooked pork.   I'd probably dine in a lot more if they served beer or liquor but that's not their fault, that's my Grandma's fault cause she is an alcoholic and my Mom says it's genetic.

I'm giving Zipps five stars not because the food is totally, unbelievably amazing, but because I go here so much and it's so consistent that it deserves five stars.   As someone who will venture into a restaurant strictly for the wings, I must say that Zipps has the hottest, best, juiciest wings in Phoenix.  They're cooked perfectly, sauced liberally and the Golden Hot are seriously something I dream about at least once a week.  I would gladly pay extra for good wings and good service, but Zipps is totally reasonable, especially if you go for happy hour, when the wings are only five bucks and the "Zipparitas" are only three, and they don't skimp on the liquor.   I think I've been to every Zipps in the valley and the Scottsdale location has always been the best.  I don't give a shit about sports, but I like to sit outside on their big orange tables and watch assholes yell at the TV's.  The service has always been prompt and we've never had them fuck anything up.  Also, we've never ordered anything we didn't like.  It's bar food, but it's bar food that is done well and that alone is worth the trip.  I always bring out of town folks to this place if they want good wings and beer.     I'm a fan for the wings alone.  Don't order the extra hot unless you want to die.

What I like about this place is that it's very obviously family owned.  Each time my co-workers and I come here (which is a lot of times) I notice that it is the father or the son that rings us up.  I think there might be two sons, but I'm not positive.  Usually, the same person that takes our order cooks our food in a tiny, exposed kitchen, and there's just something kinda cool about that.  The older Asian woman, who I assume is the cook's wife, is often sitting at the bar with her laptop and gets up periodically to help her husband (or who I assume is her husband) in the kitchen, and bus a few tables.  It's nice to go into a restaurant, even a little dive down the street from my office, and experience a nice, well lit family place.  I also appreciate that they have the news on most of the TV's, not some ESPN bullshit, and that it's CNN and not Fox.  The other thing I love about this place is that I can get a 16 oz beer for 2.50 which is a totally perfect lunch time beer.  It's not a pitcher, it's not a tiny glass, it's a perfect cheap beer to drink on my lunch hour even when no one else wants to drink (which is most of the time cause they're like "ohhh you're an alcoholic, we don't drink on our lunch hour blah blah").    I always passed this place and always wanted to go in, not only because I heart wings, but because there's a big picture of a buffalo on the outside and that's just awesome.  As far as wings go, I can dig the ones here.  I order the Atomic cause I'm literally insane about hot food, I love the delicious pain of the heat and I'm always trying to find the hottest stuff around.  The Atomic don't disappoint, yet I would say that the Long Wong's suicide are way hotter, but that's not a complaint really, since most people are sane and don't enjoy scorching their mouth in hopes to FEEL SOMETHING.  This is why I'm on Prozac.   I usually don't order the wings here, not because they're not good, but because sometimes I feel weird eating saucy meat off a bone in front of my co-workers.  Like, I have to be fucking you to really show you that side of my disgusting self.  So I've tried a few different things.  I've gotten the mozzarella sticks a few times and they're pretty awesome as far as fried cheese goes.  The fries are also always awesome, made fresh and hot and perfect and not all fancied up or done down, just fried potatoes made to order like it should be.   The worst thing I got here were the chicken nuggets.  They were obviously frozen, kinda spongey, kinda gross.  Yet, the next time we came here the nuggets were OFF THE MENU, and in their place were NEW CHICKEN STRIPS.  Which, naturally, I ordered and were totally better, crispy, juicy, a little spicy.  See, family places like this, they consult, they think, they know when shit sucks, and they fix it.  They have a lunch special which my co-worker orders EVERY time; six wings and fries and a drink for about seven bucks.   Buffalo Brown's can be a little off putting at first.  It's pretty much always empty and the few employees (the family) don't exactly seem totally stoked about your presence, but they always deliver on quality and service.  Also, there's a jukebox and a pool table in the back and while on most days neither of these items are in use, in fact they seem dusty, recently we were winging and beering here when a couple of people started blaring some hip hop music in the tiny, Asian family owned wing joint and it seemed bizarre, but oddly cinematic.   I think I even saw the straight laced Asian cook bobbing his head a little.

One thing I've discovered about Long Wong's is that the quality and service depends a lot on the location.  For instance, the wings at the Scottsdale and Thomas location are different from the wings you'll get at the Two Hippies location which are also different from the ones you get at my regular spot, and the one I'm going to talk about; the Stapley and 60 restaurant located next to the giant laser tag arena.  If you're thinking that maybe I've eaten Long Wong's wings and then played laser tag, you'd be right, I did, and it was awesome.  This location is cleaner and larger than most, and though it doesn't have the Ms. Pac Man game like the Scottsdale and Thomas location, it does have flames painted on the walls and flat screen TV's which are almost always tuned to Fox News or some sporting event I don't care about.   Another thing that has always intrigued be about this location is the walls.  The high walls are covered, mural style, with flames and boxers.  Yes, giant poorly painted flames and then black dudes boxing each other.  Why?  I don't know, and neither will you.  Sometimes my comrad and I will eat in, taking advantage of the beer special which are 2 dollar draft beers, all day, everyday which, by all accounts, wouldn't necessarily make it a "special" despite what the signs will tell you.  Long Wong's is really about the wings.  Most days I come in there is a line of people, all of them ordering wings, dozens, buckets, family packs, tearing at the bones, contemplating which flavor to get, licking their fingers.  I've only tried a few things off the Long Wong's menu: the wings, the fries, the hot dogs, and the burgers.  Seemingly there is a lot of other shit on the menu.  That's not important to me, the wings are the only worthwhile thing as most of the other items are reminiscent of slightly higher quality fast food with lettuce that is usually wilted.  Long Wong's carries a variety of wing flavors; teriyaki, asian garlic, Cajun, mild, medium, hot, suicide and my flavor of choice: SUPER suicide.  I think there are more.  I don't even know if "asian garlic" is really on the menu but it seems like it would be.  The thing about Long Wong's wings is that grabs me is that they're mostly heat.  It's not the flavor I love, it's the back of your throat, back of your tongue, lip burning heat.   I'm a sucker for the heat or anything that make me cry (like my life).  They serve the wings with Ranch, not Blue Cheese which seems more appropriate for these wings anyway.  The Ranch is good there too, not over done or spiced up by something, just a thin, normal, restaurant Ranch which they don't charge you for like some places.  They are horribly liberal with the sauce, dousing your order of plump wings in a thick, orange sauce touched slightly with chili seeds.  These are, by far, the sauciest wings I've had.  After each bite of a Long Wong's wings it looks like you killed a bunny or some other small, cute animal with your bare hand.  The sauce gets under your fingernails and the burn stays on your hands even after a run under water.  You must scrub, with soap, to rid your skin of that unique wing smell and the stain of the orange sauce.  Don't do anything sexual after eating Long Wong's wings for at least 12 hours.  There is one thing about this location which I go to that, for some reason, always seems to put a damper on my wing eating, beer drinking frenzy.  That is the grey, mustached owner who always seems to be annoyed by all the service he's getting.  I imagine this guy to be the owner based on assumption and his naturally ownery vibe.    Long Wong's on Stapley and 60, despite the Angry Successful Business Owner, is one of my favorite Mesa spots and is a true testament to what good, true take out wings SHOULD be.  Even if you don't like them hot you can appreciate the honey bbqs or the Arizona chili flavor or even the blue cheese ones.  Plus, a 7.99 combo that gives you a dozen wings, fries and drink is, like, super reasonable especially considering the quality.  I have grown fond of the new, exciting fliers placed up periodically in an attempt, I assume, by the Angry Successful Business Owner to become even MORE successful, thus more angry.  Lately I've noticed they're doing karaoke on Friday nights and 25 cent wings on Tuesdays.  Long Wongs has helped me come out of the closet as a wing enthusiast so no longer will I hide my bones in my top nightstand drawer.  I will proudly leave them chewed and dried up for all the world to see and get grossed out by.

The boyfriend inexplicably received an Applebee's gift card from one his aunts that takes too many pictures and never throws anything away.  Those last details were entirely beside the point.  He never expressed any out of the ordinary interest in this famous chain, but nonetheless we were left with a 25 dollar gift card and no choice but to man the crowded booths of our local Applebee's.   It's odd when you never go to chain restaurants how much you notice the differences between them and other places we normally eat.  We went on a Wednesday night and there were people waiting for a table.  Two million restaurants in Phoenix and these assholes are WAITING for mediocre chain food.  There were only two of us so we were seated promptly at a two top near the kitchen and instantly were mesmerized by the completely muddled,  incoherent memorabilia that lines the walls of this place.  A photo of Marilyn Monroe, next to a Route 66 sign, next to a football helmet, next to a baseball hat, next to a picture of Johnny Carson with a cigar or someshit.  Perhaps it is difficult, or rather simply unnecessary, to provide your restaurant with an easily deciphered theme.     Not that anyone who is eating at Applebee's gives a fuck.   Another thing I noticed about the ambiance is that this is certainly a watering hole for those afflicted with that whole "obesity epidemic" thing here in America.  And I'm not being a bitch, man, there were just a lot of fat people there.  Our server, an over weight Latino man with a raspy voice and  purposeful speed takes our drink orders right away.  We both get Long Islands which are served in an obscenely sized goblet straight out of the 18th century.  I am small and I don't work out and I hate when drinks are fucking so heavy that I have to use two hands.  I understand that it is now a trademark of these types of restaurants to make their drinks large, colorful and spectacular- but I can't help but pretentiously think as I lift the four pound concoction of watered down syrup and ice, "this is just fucking retarded."  We order a few appetizers; the spicy bone-in wings and mozzarella sticks.  The wings are dinky and under salted but not disgusting.  The mozzarella sticks were... mozzarella sticks.  You can't really go wrong or right with fried cheese but they got cold fast and the cheese hardened.    The redeeming quality of our Applebee's outing was our likable and attentive server.  While we never really make our way to chain restaurants (as there is just so much other good shit Phoenix has to offer), it was sort of nice to have a friendly and non-hipster server.  A guy not concerned with spouting off specials and showing us the wine list and judging us if we order domestic instead of premium,  just a giant Mexican dude probably with a family of four at home trying to make some good tips.  And I guess that's always the nice, homey thing about chain places; it's all just so average and normal and sometimes that feels like comfort.   I can't honestly say that I'll return to Applebee's anytime soon unless we come across another gift card from another relative that takes too many pictures and doesn't throw anything away, but I can say that it was an overall interesting experience to be out of our comfort zone, talking and watching the hoards of middle Americans order their steak and shrimp or chicken fried steak and shovel it in their mouth while they talk about how the fuck they're going to pay the mortgage this month.  Maybe our server can pay HIS with the giant tip we left him.

This was not the location I visited yet I can't seem to find the NEW and "IMPROVED" Buffalo Wings and Rings on Yelp.  The location I stupidly decided to go to last night was the one attached to the Fiesta Mall in Mesa.  It's new.  And it's fucking gross.   On our way home from work I told the boyfriend we should check out somewhere new for happy hour simply because I needed a new Yelp review to write.  He was reluctant to try this shit hole, pressuring me to simply enjoy a few beers at Casey Moore's instead of wanting something "new."  "But I need to yelp."  Walking into Buffalo Wings and Rings is sad and disappointing and you already know it's going to suck.  There was no one in the place and the decor consists of sports jersey's thumb tacked to a wall and three or four dated flat screen TV's showing a bunch of bullshit no one is watching.  'Cause no one is there.   We're greeted by a faux punk rock chick with a horrible fire engine red dye job which was unflattering for that A-Line haircut she paid too much for at Tony and Guy.  She was obviously new to the whole "serving" thing which is probably why she was working on a Wednesday night when everyone was watching the premier of American Idol.  We asked if we could sit outside as the inside was dreary and unwelcoming, like my Grandpa's house on Christmas.   Buffalo Wings and Rings has the ugliest and most uncomfortable plastic, grade school-esque chairs I've ever seen.  The tables are also ugly, plastic, wobbly and adorned with tree droppings and uncleaned ashtrays.    The boyfriend gives me an "I told you so" look as we move around trying to find a clean table and one in which we're not getting hit with hot air by some weird, loud buzzing fan.  We finally settle at a sticky table with an uncleaned, smelly ashtray.   I ask Faux Punk Server about their specials; 2.50 domestic pints, nothing good on draft, no food specials, no well specials.  I order a Michelob Ultra as I have little other choice.  We wait too long.  Faux Punk Server comes back, "Oh, keg is empty, have to refill, can you wait?"    We wait longer, we get our beers.  We look at the shitty, over priced Buffalo Wild Wings rip off of a menu.  I hate the whole "pick your flavor, then pick your heat" thing they do at some wing places.  It seems odd and, um, retarded.  I order five sweet and sour with the "atomic" sauce, the boyfriend get original buffalo "extra hot."  I feel it necessary to mention that when we got our wings they all tasted exactly the same.  A thin layer of Frank's Red Hot on gross, old, frozen wings served in plastic bowls.  At one point I spit a piece out because it tasted like ground beef.    We also had the pleasure of their "signature item," Sloppy Fries.  These were frozen french fries served, again, in a giant plastic bowl covered with canned chili and fake nacho cheese.  It literally looked like a bowl of vomit.  Like, someone ate a bunch of McDonald's hamburgers and fries and then threw it up in a bowl and set it down on the table for us.  We ended up having this wrapped up so I could give it to my dog.  He liked it a lot.  But as the boyfriend later pointed out, "he also licks his asshole a lot."    Ironically, Faux Punk Server said as she sat them down, "these look SO good."  As it turned out, nothing here was good or redeeming.  Even the server, though she tried her best, fumbled over her words, nervously took our plates and couldn't make eye contact.  The entire place reeked of low-ball, less than nothing American shit food and the emptiness of the dining area soon become the emptiness of my FUCKING SOUL as I dished out thirty bucks to spit shit out and bitch for an hour.   As we left the place I told the boyfriend he was right, we should have just gone to Casey Moore's and not given into my now costly desire to try something new for a stupid Yelp review.  I love you, Yelp, but this time your existence has failed me.
