My wife bought me a humidor for my birthday and I didn't have any sticks to fill it with.  I didn't really know what I liked about cigars so I went in, described what I liked about booze, women, and life on the edge.  One of the owners (who's name escapes me) was incredibly helpful.  He helped me pick out cigars that were in my price and flavor range.  From that I discovered the Tatuaje by Don Pepin Garcia.  This cigar remains my favorite to this day and I now keep my humidor stocked with Don Pepin cigars from cigarbid.com  This store is a great place to socialize with other cigar smokers, the selection of cigars, pipe tobacco, and accessories is huge.  They have a private club which looks awesome but even as a non-member it's a great place to hang out at (non-club side of course).  Check it out!

This is my kind of place!  Tons of beer on tap and in the coolers, great prices, and a wonderful place to meet up with some friends to talk.  It has music but I've never felt the place was too loud to find a quite corner where you could enjoy a brew and your company.

Quality beer, decent food, good atmosphere, all at a reasonable price.  A great place to enjoy a pint with some rock climbing friends from the Phx Rock Gym (http://www.yelp.com/biz/phoenix-rock-gym-tempe)

If you have no clue about homebrewing, homebrew supplies, or any of the terminology DO NOT HESITATE to come in.  Jeffrey Haines is highly knowledgeable, friendly, and has got myself and many of my comrades started in the art of brewing beer.  They have a large collection of partial (or all grain) mash recipes that you can buy as a kit with good directions.  Check their facebook page for the sale of the month (usually about $30 for a 5 gallon recipe).   The only negative's which aren't worth taking a star off for are the directions are in paragraph form (probably to fit on a single page) and the website is AWFUL!

This is not a fancy snooty rock gym, it's simple and to the point.  Come in, get pumped, and then take your skills out doors for a real climb.  I don't understand why people seek fancy rock gyms... It's a gym, it's purpose is to get you strong to be outdoors.  Go!

I lived in Arizona for 6 years but it took leaving and coming back for a visit to discover this hidden gem.  The pizza and service were great.  It was a little spendy for a pizza but the quality of ingredients made it worth it.

The salsa is spicy and the margaritas are strong.  The food is spicy but I could handle hotter.  The portions are reasonable and the prices are moderate.  The owner can regularly be seen there and has stopped to see how I'm doing more often then not.  I prefer the mesa location over the Phoenix one simply because it's easier to get to and usually less crowded.

It's beautiful inside with a ton of wood.  The food was good and so was the beer.  I'm not a fan of trivia night, so depending on your persuasion you may want to schedule around that.   A great place for beer o'clock on St. Patty's day!

I was not impressed by the staff nor the limited tea accessories.  I prefer loose tea and not only did they not sell tea but nothing to do with loose tea.  They also had a cheep (looking) table in the front of the store.  The place was wierd.
