If I could give this a negative star, I would. I can deal with poor customer service, but finding glass in a biscuit? Unacceptable!  I went to this location last night with my boyfriend, his mother, and her fianc√©. Our server was in training, and the girl "supervising" her was off at another table. I ordered the Sangria and my boyfriend order a Fat Tire. When the drinks were delivered, the server spilled the ENTIRE sangria in his lap. Luckily he was wearing leather pants, so he just dried himself off. However, his $300+ shoes were soaked.   To attempt to make up for this spill (let's face it, spills happen), the manager said she would send a comped appetizer to us. Well that never showed up. Apparently there was a miscommunication.  Fast forward, the meal finally comes. The food was great, thank god! I ask for a box for my leftovers, and we ask for some of the biscuits to go.   Later that night, my boyfriend says, "I'm going to eat all the biscuits." I asked him to save me one, and thank god he didn't eat it. I microwaved the last biscuit this morning, and bit down into it, only to find a MASSIVE piece of glass embedded in the biscuit. I can't be sure if the glass was intentionally put there, or if it may have gotten mixed in earlier, but it certainly seems fishy. I will definitely be pursuing some kind of legal action & involving the news because this is UNACCEPTABLE and will never happen again. $87 (before tip) with a comped meal & appetizer will never be worth what I found.   DO NOT EAT HERE.

HTC is the greatest piercing shop in the valley - hands down. I wouldn't trust anyone else. The people are awesome & the piercers are top notch.   I have double nostrils, and have been really picky about the alignment since day one. They always guarantee their work & have been more than accommodating for me.   If you guys read this, you're the best! I love you all. Special thanks to Kevin & Jacob!

Wow. Like WOW! never, and I mean never! Go here. Unless you enjoy shitty service. I've never experienced worse service in my life.   My friend and I got to the restaurant during happy hour around 8:50-9PM (keep in mind they're open until 11PM! So we were not the assholes that come in right before you close.). The manager sat us, and our server Carly came over after like 6-7 minutes of nothingness later.  When she approached our table, it was clear she had no interest in serving us (I can't fathom why not, considering we were the ONLY table). It took her like 10 minutes to bring us our drinks. Luckily our food came out shortly after in a timely manner. I ordered the sweet potato roll, and it was the last thing to come out. I don't know if you've ever had sweet potato before, but in general they're orange, so seeing that they were clear/translucent was too weird for me. I would have sent it back, but Carly decided talking to her coworkers and ignoring us, even after we were clearly finished, was a better idea! So when she finally came over, I told her she could take it back & that something about it wasn't right. She stood there questioning me like I was on trial about why it wasn't right/what I thought was wrong. If a customer complains, it doesn't matter what the problem was, just take care of it!! So she takes the roll back, while asking the chef behind the counter if he wants to try it to see what he thinks (which he did try it!). UHM WHAT, YOURE GOING TO EAT FOOD OFF OF A CUSTOMER'S PLATE?! I'm sorry, but that's a MAJOR health code violation!!!! She ended up sending the manager over after that, who then further questioned me, but comped it anyway. When we finally looked at the check, some of the dishes weren't correctly priced as they were on the happy hour menu. So my friend approached the counter where she waited.. And waited for Carly to come over so she could show her the receipt's error. When she decided to come help, she tried to argue with my friend over the happy hour menu, saying that "well it changes every month." Well, excuse me, but it was on the menu, and my friend even showed her. She finally fixed it, and by the time she did, we had been waiting close to 10 additional minutes since the manager had been to our table.   We spent about an hour and half at this restaurant. Unfortunately, I won't get that time or money back. Do NOT waste yours. Let this be a warning!

I went in today for my routine service, and I know I have tricky hair sometimes. I saw Sadie, and let me just say, she was AMAZING. I used to see Alivia at Ahwatukee for about a year, and was so sad when she left EWC. But now that I've seen Sadie, I hope she sticks around for a LONG time!  She was so thorough, incredibly fast, and did a great job. I'm really confident in her skills as a waxer and as a person. We had good conversation, and nothing seemed awkward or forced.   10/10 do recommend seeing Sadie! :)

First time in, I ordered the BBQ chicken salad and some French fries. I always hesitate when ordering salads to go because sometimes the salad gets soggy or the dressing gets warm, etc. but that wasn't the case! The salad was chopped fresh, all the ingredients were crisp, and it was really a massive salad - definitely big enough to split!  The French fries were also really good. Not too soft, just enough crunch. I asked for extra season salt on the side just per a previous review saying they weren't salty enough, but I found them to be exactly what I was wanting.  Overall, great food, really pleasant upbeat staff, and everything was put together in a timely manner.   *only negative, is that you'll definitely smell like the restaurant when you leave. So if you're worried about smelling, shower when you get home.*
