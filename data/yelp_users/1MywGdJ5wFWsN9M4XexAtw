Favorite coffee house in the country. Environment is the best I've ever experienced, and the drinks are great. Music is phenomenal and they regularly rotate local art throughout the shop. Great hours and lots of art/design mags around to browse through.

Worst iced mocha I've ever had. About like a chocolate protein shake. Internet was down more than it wasn't. Maybe I came on a bad day, and maybe I picked a bad drink. Oh well. Just a Starbucks wannabe shop for me.

So cute. The food is phenomenal, great meeting or planning space. Huge menu. Significantly better than Panera or Paradise Bakery.
