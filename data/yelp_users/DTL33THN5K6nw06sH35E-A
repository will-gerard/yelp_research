Every time I've been to Jerry's shop I've found the staff to be really friendly and helpful.  This little shop is a hidden gem for those of us who loose many balls in a few rounds of golf.

One of my favorite places to eat  and in a good location.  Although a few times  we've had to wait for a long time until all the plates are on our table. Bad timing, you don't want to start eating when someone in front of you is still waiting for his plate. And they might give you too little sauce  on your teriyaki bowl. Ask for extra. I like the beers they carry.

We went out looking for pancakes one Sunday morning my BF and I.   We decided to give The Wagon Wheel in Cave Creek a try.   Big mistake.  Lets just say that if you like to eat at a clean establishment, this is not your place.   If you like the sight of cockroaches inches away from where you're eating, this definitely your place.   I'm embarrassed to say that I still tried their food; the pancakes where alright, but as soon as I felt a lump of unmixed batter, I spat it out immediately thinking the worst.

I went holiday shopping at Steinmart. The place is nice and the staff friendly. I'd be happy if i hadn't found out that my purchase there was charged twice. Once the day I shopped there and again ten days later.  This  made me overdraft my checking account and wasted my time in the phone filling a claim with my bank. Now, whether this was foul play by Steinmart or my bank, I'm not sure. But I'm tired of being jerked around by big companies. Check your bills and keep all your receipts from this store.

Son paletas estilo Michoacán! I love this place because they always make their products with fresh ingredients. I've had their  Arroz con Leche  and Piña paletas. The only thing I dislike is that they have in their menu items that they "have run out of" and both times I've had to go for a second choice.

I don't like to write reviews for places where I've only been once because I know my mood affects the way I feel about things. I also like to give second chances to establishments that, for some reason or another, were not up to par the first time, specially if it's a place like Hacienda's, that is close to my office and where I can grab a good bite at a reasonable price.   I think that lady who wrote that angry review earlier was clearly having a bad day altogether because I've been to this restaurant a few times, and none of these times --  although some were better than others -- I had such a bad experience. I also don't get why I someone was upset that the owner was visiting other local businesses. I'd say that's part of an owner's job. The general manager overlooks the staff IMO . And by the way, I've had Guacamole in more than one dish there, I'm sure that if she had asked, she would've gotten a side of guac in one of those little molcajete dishes.   I've had a few of their appetizers, the sopes, the empanadas, the street tacos the tostadas and the Nachos. Don't order the nachos unless you have two or more really hungry people. The sopes and tostadas are very similar but  the sopes have a thicker deep fried tortilla.The street tacos are small, but that's how a true "street taco" from El DF is. My favorite one is the Empanada, because it tastes like it's made with homemade Picadillo.  Of the main dishes, I've had the chicken Mole. It's unfair for me to rate it because for someone with a Mexican mom who can cook authentic mole, no other mole will ever come close. But I can say they're on the right track. I've heard from the staff that they are listening closely to feedback they're getting from the locals and are adjusting to the taste of  this new location. And I can tell it's true because I've had a few different types of salsa with their chips and the flavor has gotten better and better.    Will I return? Yes, I gotta go back to try their deep-fried Ice cream.
