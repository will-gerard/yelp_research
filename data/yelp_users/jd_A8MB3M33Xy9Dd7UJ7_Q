Wild red flight with cheese!  Try it. Helpful staff, very friendly, especially Todd and Drew.

Bottom line: The food was not very good and for the high prices it should have been delicious. ($41 for salmon without sides / $63 for lamb.). My advice order a steak. It will at least be good (reported the fourth guest at out table who had the filet.)  Some staffers were awesome, not our table staff who were not accommodating and seemed put out by requests.  I had the salmon which was undercooked in the middle by a lot. I like sushi, but not combined with cooked salmon. A guest at our table had the lamb which was extremely fatty. We were warned by the waiter in a thick accent which was hard to understand because the music was so loud (I like loud music, but this was so loud I couldn't hear the person next to me at a near shout) When we asked them to turn it down, the look from the support staff at the table was poisonous.  I asked for a large glass of water instead of the small table glass. The table "assistant", for lack of better terminology, informed me there were not larger glasses. I asked her then to please not let my glass sit empty. It did. She came over many times to fill the sparkling water ordered by another at our table but let mine go unfilled until I asked. It had been a long day at an expo without much water and it would have been a kindness to have a larger or filled glass. I should have ordered fancy water and maybe I'd have had better service.  Ultimately I had to apologize to my boss for picking the place because he was not happy with the selections, quality, or service. It was a disappointing experience. Because of it, I didn't visit the sister restaurant for burgers the next day (which I was looking forward to trying.)

We were lost on our way to Las Vegas.  I grabbed the Yelp app to find a place to eat and found Vogue.  I was able to book a table through Open table via the Yelp app which was very convenient.  We had the Vogue Burger and Vogue Salad.  Both were fantastic.  The blue cheese on the burger was bold, but the sweet glazed onions tamed the overall flavor and was surprisingly delicious.  The salad used a very textured lettuce I hadn't tried before, it was different but tasty.  I enjoyed had a Petite Sirah by the glass which was amazing, so smooth.    The restaurant had outdoor seating which was very nice and comfortable, but it was a cold night.  The wait staff quickly fixed the temperature by turning on an overhead heater.    We will definitely stop here again on our way to Las Vegas!

The staff here is unbelievably friendly and awesome. Katie introduced herself and took great care of us. She recommended drinks, and encourages me to come back (which I did) and them remembered me. How amazing is that and in a packed club!  They offer really diverse music. Friday was techno, Saturday was rap/hip-hop, and tonight is Metal. I can see myself as a regular if the club wasn't so far from me.   A club, it is. But it's also a hometown bar. And a trendy lounge. How is all?  I can't explain it. It just is. Great place!!!!

Best. Pedicures. EVER! I love the atmosphere here, and the employees are very friendly. I never want a pedicure from anyone else. So relaxing, and my feet feel so soft!

I can see why this place gets such poor reviews; it's well deserved.   This restaurant is in an airport, so many people are in a bit of a hurry, and the whole process took way too long. I was seated five minutes before anyone stopped over to take an order.  After I did, three times the waitress had to try to put an order in just to come back and say "bad news" we're also out of that meat.  There should be better ordering, improved communication when they're out of something so I don't spend 10 minutes waiting to place an order just to have the waitress disappear for five minutes and then come back and have the process start again (three times!)  I finally ordered the burger and moved on with my life.  The order took another 15 minutes to arrive. The beans and rice were tasty, and the burger was pretty good (jerk burger.  If I was in a pinch, I'd eat there again, but only in a pinch.   One drink and a burger was $30, airports are notoriously overpriced so I was not surprised, but I was not satisfied with any part of my experience, except the waitress was pleasant even after all the headaches. Kudos to her, she's the only reason this is a two star rating.

Had a really fun time!  Comedy was funny, all seats are close enough to be a good seat.

This urgent care is fast, helpful, and I give them a 5-star for convenience.   Pros: 1. They answered the phone live, no waiting for an automated voicemail.  2. They gave a quote on the wait time and beat the estimate.  3. I was able to get my prescriptions filled there.  4. Dr. Randall, a DO, was able to not only treat me for my issue (neck pain) he was able to do a treatment similar to a chiropractic adjustment, and that was awesome!  He's helpful, listens, is gentle and patient!  Great doctor!!!  Cons: - I had to fill out the same paperwork even though I've been seen here before.    Thanks for the care today, now I am confident I can take the five hour plane ride without being in agony!

I love this place!    They offer so many vegetarian combinations, but they have great meat choices too.  If you check in on yelp, you get a free iced tea, and it's amazing; not your typical iced tea.    Pro's:  Great selection of veggies Line moves quickly Several Spicy choices Very friendly and helpful staff  Cons: Parking can be tough Small eating area, better to-go for large parties or busy hours  Keep up the great work!

Don't ask for the fans to be turned off (even if it's only 60 degrees out) unless you want a rude reply... (Thanks Cathy.)  Paradise, you're going downhill   Also, I always ask for a vegetarian salad and they always say, you can just order it without the meat. As a vegetarian, why pay for meat when I'm not getting it?  Seriously!

This particular Starbucks is having difficulty managing how busy they are. Please HQ send a specialist to help with the looooong wait times. I've been at busier Starbucks before and they do a better job. The staff here is under trained and not your typical happy Starbucks employees. Disappointed for now.

So knowledgeable, helpful, patient, and awesome!  The store was clean and comfortable; providing a great atmosphere.  I enjoyed the trip here.  I was able to get all of my questions answered and pick up the product I needed.    They were able to explain Voltage, Ohms, Wattage, and the variable voltage batteries.  I was able to learn a lot and troubleshoot a problem I was having with the MVP battery.    I will definitely be back!
