Well, it wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. When I pay $2.10 for a slice of pizza, I'm expecting an interesting challenge for my taste buds. But I didn't get that. It was very plain. Granted they made it fresh, but i suspect they used cheap ingredients.   When I got there, I noticed the dim lighting. I also noticed the lack of greeting even though there were 2 people behind the counter both of whom saw me when I came in. They have a flat screen which was showing basketball so I guess that's a plus.   I scanned the unorganized menu and discovered that they sell beer and full glasses of wine, which was cool. I didn't get the wine but if i ever go back there, ill definitely try it out.   So behind the counter, there were a couple of precooked pizzas one mushroom and one pepperoni. I asked the cashier if I could have a slice of each. She said 5 minutes. 15 minutes later I got my pizza. Although I was a little bit annoyed, I was impressed that they chose to make me a couple of fresh ones instead of the precooked slices.   So as you could imagine i was excited to taste fresh pizza. The slices were pretty big actually. And smelled pretty good too. The taste however wasn't special.   The peperoni slice was a little more greasy than normal. I got a sensation that the cheese was not all the way melted when I bit into it. You know when you take a bite of pizza that is well cooked and when you take a bite, a stran of melted cheese stretches between your mouth and the slice? Yeah, I didn't get that. Instead i bit it and it easily came apart. I noticed the same thing with the peperoni. I personally like my pepperoni to be slightly crunchy. This pepperoni was not. The sauce had very little flavor. But it did have a good texture. And last but not least, the crust was actually good. It was flaky and crumbled nicely in my mouth. And despite the higher amount of grease, the crust remained dry.   The mushroom pizza was the same except the mushrooms again, had very little flavor.   Overall it wasn't a bad pizza. It was New York style but most New York style pizza has a lot of flavor in it. These didn't Also the environment and customer service was sub-par. But, I would go back just for some wine. Also I want to try the wings. You never know when you discover a hidden wing gem.

Four words: I love this place. But if its not one of their cheese crisps, its almost not worth it....  The other day was my second  visit to this place and I was hoping to impress my friend with their fresh delicious Mexican dishes.   It was looking good when we first arrived because the very friendly employee really did a good job displaying his knowledge of their rather impressive menu. He gave recommendations to their enchiladas and burritos. I really wanted to get one of their impressive cheese crisps like I got last time, hoping to impress my friend, however I was feeling bold and decided to get the shrimp burrito.   First wrong thing that immediately stood out was that they charge 25 cents for refills. That sort of cheap tactic really spells out a lot about an establishment. Also since their drinks are 2 bucks, I really didn't feel like buying refills. Oh and did I mention that I'm a standard debit card wielding American? No quarters in my pocket. But no big deal.   So they took some time for our dishes to be completed which was not a surprise since last time they did the same thing. However last time once they finished, I was able to enjoy a most delicious cheese crisp. This time though, I was presented with a shrimp burrito with a side of lettuce? What do I do with the lettuce? Hmmm  The burrito itself was too hot. (Not spicy). I felt that I was unable to grasp the true flavor of the shrimp because of this problem. So naturally I was much slower in my eating. I gave the shrimp an opportunity to savor in my mouth so I can get the full flavor. I was wrong. Each piece of shrimp was doused in a sauce similar to a light soy sauce. Through the hot temperature, I was able to conclude that each of the pieces were quite bland. It was disappointing per bite because I expected a flavor burst each time, but never got it.   The burrito was full of sauce. So full in fact that eventually, the bottom of the burrito collapsed and the sauce and shrimp spilled onto my plate.  ]= Still hot. So I continued my meal without the tortilla and simply forked the rest of my shrimp.   Overall I actually like this place. (because of cheese crisps) When I came the first time, there was sports on the tv and very  good food being served.

I hope you don't think that I'm too critical by the end of this review.   But honestly I've been to better dive bars. The first thing that struck me was the location. Crap! It shares a wall the the Trunk Space, on a corner of Grand Ave and 7th ave I believe. Getting there, maneuvering the strange sharp turns, and then locating a parking spot definitely downs my drinking enthusiasm.  -1 for initial placement. Although, if you happen to be catching a show at the Trunk Space, this place is 5 steps away.   When I first entered the place, I admit I was impressed with the interior decor. The whole tiki-style theme was nice and consistent. Except for all the stuff behind the bar. I mean a piece of paper with a note written with a marker saying "We have the right to refuse anyone service", just screams "low class establishment here" to me. At least the air conditioning and lighting were comforting.  The service was decent. The lack of crowd allowed my party and I the utmost dedicated attention. I ordered a large pitcher of Blue Moon, which if you have a three person group, the price is pretty good. You get three smaller than usual frosted glasses which I liked. However, as a fan of Blue Moon, I was unimpressed by how bland the white ale tasted!! I'm sure it was flat. It was cold though. Ill give them that.  Overall, I would come back again, but only if I happen to be at the Trunk Space. I see no reason to deliberately make this place my destination.  By the way this place is Cash Only......

So my coworker was really promoting this place to me, and I felt like Chinese food so our decision was made.......Horrible mistake!  Number One: Disgusting bland food. Every single (limited selection) dish sucked! The orange chicken tasted like old microwaved from freezer over sauced cardboard. The onion rings were crap. The egg rolls, crap. The chow mein noodles which I thought were supposed to look brown, were these pale watery strans of crap. The rice, which was clearly not white rice, was bland. The desserts sucked as well. Also, the presentation of the food looked very sloppy.   Number Two: Horrible enviornment. Ugly pink walls with horrible dollar store decorations. The booth seats were WAAAAYYY to close to the tables which made for an uncomfortable sitting experience. The sneeze guards were dirty. Weird smell. And stupid layout, with a couple of booths too close to the employee personal area and some too close to the (again small) buffet line.   Number Three: After this review, I am calling the health services on this disgustng place. A couple of times I noticed an employee scratching their nose, and then continuing with their work. Then I was forcing down my food when my coworker spots a moving insect on the wall next to us. It was a BABY COCKROACH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Screw this place. I will never ever go back here. And if this place isnt shut down, I hope nobody else does either.   On the plus side, its only $6.00. But still not worth it. If I could, I would give this place negetive 1000000000000000000000 stars.

Honestly I've never heard of this place. I was in the area searching for a breakfast spot and this random little nugget appeared. It was a toss up between this place and The Good Egg. Needless to say 5th Avenue Cafe was the right choice.  Right from the get go my party and I noticed the amazing decor. It had a Memphis feel to it with alot of jazz themed nick nacks everywhere. There was some good music playing too. (Herby Hancock)   Waitress was pretty friendly and attentive. She told us that their skillet dishes were their main dishes. Unfortunately their waffle machine was down and they had to wait for some guy to come fix it. I thought that strange for some reason.  Their menu is large. Typical breakfast menu except everything was southwestern style! Also the prices were pretty cheap. We decided to share food. So we got their homemade pancake, French toast, Bacon omelette, biscuits and gravy, and spiced potatoes. All good. Allow me to describe each dish in detail!!  First those potatoes were.....perfect. Cooked just right. spiced just right. There was a slight crunch that was consistent throughout the dish which meant the chef knew what they were doing. They were the red potatoes too. The soft interior filled my taste buds with delight. Each bite made me think about life and how good it was.   Then there was the Bacon omelette. But that's to vague. It was actually the Bacon avoacoado perfectly seasoned tomato and sausage gravy omelette with a side of sour cream. (We added the gravy on ourselves). Was this heaven? I submit yes! How did they perfectly cook the Bacon and eggs together with the tomatoes so eligantly? Magic? However they did it, it worked. Each bite was satisfying. Delectable is the only word that comes to mind. The only thing that could have made it better was cheese. Oh wait a minute, there was cheese! Swiss cheese to be exact. Melted and aged just right.   My goodness the French toast was just simply not fair. Why? Because for now on if I want the best French toast in the world I have to go to 5th Avenue Cafe. Which means I have to drive downtown each and every time. But....its absolutely worth it. Soft yet crunchy goodness. Powdered sugar not overbearing. And once you top it with syrup, you melt. Read that again. The French toast stays crunchy somehow (again magic), but you yourself melt. After the first bite, I sat back in my seat and pondered the applications of modern miracles. Was I even allowed to take another bite of this......beautiful creation? How can I be? Who am I to say that I'm worthy enough to do so? Whatever I did anyways. And it was good.  Pancake was also pretty good. There was a nice slight buttery taste. And although not fluffy, it did melt in your mouth. It paired nicely with my cup of coffee. (Speaking of food pairing, I noticed a large beer selection. Next time I come in I will delve into my other passion).   We also got a side of Bacon just to sample it. Very good. The friend I was with described it as "salty goodness." To me it was slightly over cooked but that's just a personal preference.  Overall perfect place. Also all that which I described which filled us up cost less than $20.00!!!!!! Another miracle? No just people who can make good food, and present reasonable prices due to skillfull accounting practices.  This place has become my spot. Sorry "The Place" but I like breakfast here better. But "The Place" does have a large beer selection as well including local beers on tap. So maybe their tied?   Ok bye.

I love buffets. But not this one. Its expensive. Its limited. Its crowded. And the food is subpar.  A group of friends and I decided on this place after another friend gave it a thumbs up. Ok, I thought. I love buffets.  First thing I noticed, more than five people standing in the front smoking. Like you have to shuffle passed them to get it. What if I had my baby with me? Or my family? Second, some woman was asking everyone to wash their car windows in exchange for diapers. SMH!!  So we go inside to a very crowded small one man register. I paid for two friends and myself. Plus three drinks??? $42.00 So letter me get this straight. This is a buffet but without self serving access to a beverage bar?? And I had to pay for it? Why am i here and not at old country buffet?   So we are seated. Not a bad atmosphere except for the large crowd. I went and collected my food. I got fried chicken and a side salad and bread roll to go with my iced tea. All crap, even the tea.  Worst chicken I've ever had. And its hard for me to not finish fried chicken down to the bone. Bit this fiscrace of a piece of crap just simply wasnt worthy for my stomache. Bland. Not that crispy. A little dry. Smelled funny. Bread was stale. Salad wasnt that fresh although it wasnt too bad. And tea was brisk which isn't tea.   In order to get refills I had to wait for waitress to come and do it for me cause im a baby who cant get his own drink? I didnt even try the dessert.   Overall not impressed. But I guess the dishes were clean and they had catfish off the grill. I didn't try it but it did smell good. If I were in a buffet mood, old country and home town are better selections. Also they are cheaper.

I love seafood and its been a while since I've had some. (Excluding Long John Silvers). And I was taking my family out for a Friday night feast.   We found this little hole in the wall restaurant randomly around 59th ave and Union Hills. And we decided to try it out.  At first glance, the interior was.....kinda plain. It didn't really have a "pier" feel to it and take away the small amount of wall decorations, you get an empty room with cheep tables and chairs everywhere. But it was busy. And everyone seemed happy with what they were eating.   I noticed the rather large beer selection they had going on. Cool little spot to have a social brunch with some friends, plus they had a flat screen which probably played sports.   Also it smelled good in there. I and my family were really hungry, (especially my daughter), and nothing teased our appetites like the lingering smell of fresh seafood being cooked in the back.   So we made our choices, sat down and our food arrived. We got the platter sampler, which had a variety of fried sea foods. We got the large clam chowder inside of the fresh baked bread bowl. And we got a large fried shrimp burrito. The kids got a kids meal plate each which was very small. So warning to anybody, if you have a kid 7 and up, get him or her a normal plate because I promise you they will be disappointed.   On the flip side, our sampler plate was huge. April and I had a concern that we couldn't share our platter since only one of each seafood was in the description on the menu, but our fears were put to rest when we were rewarded with very large samples. So the sampler plate was delicious. The hush puppies we fresh. Also the sampler had chicken, which was OK. A little dry.   The clam chowder was very good. So was the bread bowl. But We felt like it was too cold. Like they should have heated it up more. And in fact when I asked them too, they gave us another free bowl of hotter chowder which was pretty cool. The staff was very friendly by the way. They answered all our questions. They didn't argue. The checked in on us every once in a while. Good staff.   The highlight food was the fried shrimp burrito. April and I both loved it. We used to get our shrimp burritos from Rubios but after the one from Pier 83, we may have found our new provider. It was well made too. Not too soggy, (until around the end of it). Good amount of shrimp. Not over fried. Perfect.   Overall this place was a fantastic find. A little pricey for us average people, but not too pricey for a family out night. Will I be back? Yes. Oh and also I believe Weds is all you can eat fried fish night.

Well what can I say? Its your basic sports grill. Plenty of plasmas, large variety of alcohol, and a lot of old people. My first impression was a lively crowd but I soon realized how dull it was. Don't get me wrong, this place is excellent for group events but if you and some friends are looking for a night out, this is not the place. Standard beer prices.

Last night while i was drunk as heck coming back from a party, my friends and I collectively decided that we were extremely hungry. It was 2 in the morning and not a whole lot of choices came to mind. That is is until my friend suggested the 24 hours federicos.   There was a drive through and the service was fast and simple. I got the carne asada buritto with sour cream and pico, with a little quacamole. It was made quicky and i have to tell you that each and every bite i took of that mama jama was equal to heaven.   The buritto was huge. And freakin heavy. Every bite was filled with carne and sour cream. It was funny because my friend was like "take a few bites and we will eat the rest when we get home" , but i couldnt stop. I devoured the entire beast within minutes and I was satisfied.

Well, I accompanied my friend here a weeks ago because his friend had a special happy hour thing going on.   So in order to receive the happy hour promotional benefits, you had to wear a wrists band based on the person your representing. So I'm thinking, "Going to get good beer and liquor at good prices!", nope. All they did was lower their ridiculous prices down to regular bar prices. Furthermore, not only do they not have any special exotic drinks, but they didn't even have a special house drink nor any drink specials. Not impressed. Also the happy hour wrist band prevents you from having to pay the $10 entrance fee.  *rolls eyes*  It had a club/restaurant/sports bar atmosphere. Weird combination to say the least but it smelled good. And the waitresses in tight short black shorts were pleasing to the eyes I guess. I guess my main complaint about this place is, it doesnt seem like a place where I am willing to follow their strict dress requirements just so I can have a basic bar experience. If you must go, make sure you have a happy hour promotional thing going on. I personally will just go to the yard house or margaritaville. Or maybe just to johnny rockets or something. West gate has way better selections.

Truly the best Hawaiian BBQ in the city! I have been here more than a few times and have never been disappointed. Friendly staff coupled with delicious food delivers a consistent enjoyable experience each and every time. Oh and its quite affordable as well.  This place has won the best in Phoenix award a few times and the judges got it right. One day I would like to view their meat selection process person because they do an amazing job. ALL good cuts! I recommend you make the trip from wherever you are in the Maricopa area to this location. it is absolutely worth it.   They beef is perfectly seasoned. It has a slight sweet taste to it. And yet it retains the delicious mix of flavorings including subtle onion. It perfectly falls of the small amount of bones that it wraps around. Its very savory.   The BBQ chicken is perfect as well. Nicely cooked. Not too juicy and not too dry.   And of course the famous Mac salad. I don't usually like mac salad but this is the exception. Its perfect. Its light, not overbearing. And tastes amazing.   And of course their side sauces are custom made and perfect. They have spicy and sweet.   Check this place out. You will not be disappointed.

I am typically polite and will eat almost anything despite my feelings of the pallet. But in all honesty I am very picky and will critique every small imperfect detail and forever judge those responsible. This holds true especially when it comes to BBQ. My favorite of all foods. So when I entered Dickeys BBQ Pit, I immediately began my assessment.   A decent smell immediately filled my nostrils when I opened the entrance door. My stomach, which was empty, immediately began to rumble. But not for BBQ. It smelled like meat cooking but not BBQing. I was instantly concerned. I love when a grill is fired up and the combination of good old American BBQ is smoking, which should consist of a sweet tangy smell and thick cut beef.  Sigh but anyways the decor was cool. It was picnic themed. Not alot of places to sit though. It was either sit near foot traffic or near the bathrooms. The tables were very small and cramped too.   The staff was friendly. They greeted my party and I. The menu is pretty simple. We got the family order which is two meats 1lb each, three sides, and seven rolls. Drinks were seperate. Overall the cost was $49.   The pitmaster imformed me that all items on the menu were made from scratch. Pretty cool. All food was already made though. They pulled the meats from the ovens and the sides from the back. We were eating within 15 minutes of coming in.  So for the meats we ordered 1lb of pulled pork. And two 1/2lbs of sausage. One was spicy and the other was jalepnio spicy. For the sides we chose macoroni and cheese, mashed potatoes, and bbq'd beans.   Despite the small cramped table we were all able to make our plates and began eating.   The pulled pork was ok. It was a little cold but cooked just right. It lacked sufficient seasoning in my personal opinion but it was still good. Also I should mention they provided three types of BBQ sauce on the side. They were sweet, spicy, and original. I paired my pulled pork with spicy. BBQ sauce was perfect. It had a nice spicy punch with a savory sweet tangy lingering after taste. It didn't burn and yet fulfilled my spicy needs.   Both sausages were quite good. I was very impressed. Each bite was delectable. The jalepenio was injected with cheese. Good Lord! The other one allowed me to enjoy the sausage in itself which did not disappoint, let me tell you.   The BBQ beans and Mac and cheese weren't anything special. I mean they were good but they didn't have a wow factor. However, the mashed potatoes were on a different level. They were mashed to perfection. They were sprinkled with large chive chuncks. They were lightly buttered. They had a nice top layer of cheese on top. They even had a slight burnt crunchy layer on top. Very good. There were other sides to choose and when I go back (and I will) I will try them, but I will still get the mashed potatoes.  Also the rolls were pretty good. They had a unique underbaked style to them that was quite enjoyable. The kids in my party made mini sanwhiches with them. I wish we got more than 7 though. When we find a dish that we like, we like to have seconds and even thirds sometimes. A family of five (two adults and three children) will not be satisfied with 7 rolls.   Overall the experience was good. Very good BBQ eatery. Kids eat free on Sundays and everyday there is free unlimited ice cream. (rootbeer floats anyone). I rate this place a 5/5. The only changes I would make is the tables and the amount of rolls served. I will definately be back.

Just real quick, they make the best sandwiches for cheap. Only 3.99 for a huge hearty sandwich custom made to your liking. Several different types of meat and cheeses and several different types of bread and mustards. Oh and its all high quality. Of course if you want, you can pay a dollar more to select only Boar's Head brand, which does make a much tastier meat.   Oh and if you are into organic foods, tea, fresh fruit, and high quality customer service, this place is for you. I recommend this place to everybody.

I'm a burger guy and I got yo say that this place makes some of the best burgers in town. The juicy flavorful patty between two fresh baked buns topped with FRESH ingredients will have you floored and satisfied. I cannot stress enough about how FRESH the ingredients are. Including the lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, beef, buns, jalapeño, and even condiments. Each bite was so good. Very juicy. Perfectly seasoned. And again you can't help buy acknowledge the superior fresh ingredients. Their delicious fries pair nicely. They have homemade horchata which I didn't try. But I did try their carne asada tacos and I was impressed.   Overall a great little find. If your a burger connoisseur like myself, I recommend giving this place a visit. Order it to go and pair it with an Arrogant Bastard. If you add a little bit of a kick to the burger like Tapatio, or if you added jalapeños, Arrogant Bastard will definitely react nicely with the spicy tones and of course the after taste will mix nicely together with the seasonings. And because of the fresh ingredients you'll be able to go back and forth between beer and burger while enjoying the zesty fries.

Super poor computer systems. The customer service was fine. However, what should have been a quick 15 minute in and out license replacement, turned out to be almost 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back. But why? Why did it take so long? Simple: the agents were not able to figure out a way to update my mailing address.................. I'll repeat: THE AGENTS WERE NOT ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CHANGE MY MAILING ADDRESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  At first they blamed one another for improper procedure. Then about an hour in, the excuse became that the system was going down. System? I just need my new license. Why can't you just simply do it? Giant waste of my time. I had appointments that I had to cancel. I hope to God I Dont have to return to this miserable place.
