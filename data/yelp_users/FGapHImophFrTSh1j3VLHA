Attended the Ancient Ales, Modern Science event with several others and was very disappointed.  The Ancient Ales that we had the privilege of tasting were fantastic but unfortunately only 1 or 2 of the breweries made it the whole 4 hours. We spent most of our night waiting in line for the breweries whose booths were open and didn't get a chance to see much of the Science Center, thankfully I was with good company.

Sitting in the restaurant as I type this review.  Green has been one of my favorite restaurants since they opened a few yrs ago. I'm not vegan nor vegetarian and everything I've ordered has been delicious.   The restaurant is constantly working to improve itself and each time I go my experience is better than the prior. The Tempe/ South Scottsdale location recently updated their menus (one week ago), while keeping some favorites from the old menus, and I was a little apprehensive. I was recommended the Karma Curry. The dish is fantastic, as expected. I can't wait to go back and try some of the other newly added dishes. If you're looking for something light yet fulfilling give Green a shot, you'll love it.

Made it just in time for happy hour. Happy hour is from 4-7 EVERY night.   Our fantastic server Anne recommended a Tequila. Maybe the best Tequila I have ever had the chance to taste:  Herradura Cien Agaves Single Barrel Reposado    Ask for it cold!***
