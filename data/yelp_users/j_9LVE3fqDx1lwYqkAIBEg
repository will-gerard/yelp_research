What sets Hava Java apart from the rest of the coffee shops in town is the amazing service you'll get there.  I recently returned to Phoenix after spending a few years in Oregon and when I stopped into Hava Java, not only did I recognize the barista behind the counter, but she recognized me, too.  That is pretty impressive after a couple years.  After talking with her for a while, it turns out that the owner takes really good care of his employees (full benefits, etc.) and they have very little turnover there.  She said that they have only lost one person since I have been away.  That is impressive for a coffee shop.    Their espresso is pretty good and according to my wife, their tea is the best she's had in town.  It is the best place for coffee that I know of in the area.

Lux serves the best espresso in Phoenix.  The service has always been good and they even have Pane Bianco (an amazing sandwich shop) next door if you are there around lunch time.  I recently moved back to Phoenix after spending a couple years in Oregon and going to Lux was one of the first things I wanted to do (in addition to getting some decent Mexican food).  I am looking forward to many more visits in the immediate future.

You are pretty much guaranteed a good burger at Delux.  That plus a hugeormous selection of beer and amazing service equals a great meal.  About the service, the last time I was there my waitress had a knack for knowing what I wanted before even I did.  That was impressive.  If I needed my drink topped off she was already on it.   Word to the wise, chances are you'll be sitting at a big long table with a bunch of other people.  So if you are looking for something more intimate, this isn't your place.

I was pretty disappointed with Steve's Espresso.  Considering its moniker, you'd think the espresso would be good here.  It wasn't.  My espresso was bitter and a touch sour.  It was drinkable, but that's hardly a recommendation.    I tried one of their breakfast pastries, with cheese, bacon, and egg.  I was even less impressed with that.  I was surprised when the cashier handed it to me and told me I should go microwave it myself in an oven they have by the door.  I was told to put it in for 45 seconds.  I figured they would know their business and trusted what I was told.  After I left I decided to sneak a bite while stopped at a light.  The thing was ice cold in the center.  Great.  A bacon, egg and cheese-icle.  Even the part around the edge that was warm wasn't that great.  The dough tasted like it came out of a tube.  I probably would have been better off with something else.  There were several baked goods in the case that looked amazing.  The person that helped me seemed really nice, so I kind of feel bad giving the place such a hard review.  Honestly, most people would probably be happy with the drinks here, especially if you're the sort that pumps a bunch of sugary crap into your drink.   According to a sign on the door they specialize in French press coffee, so ordering that might be a better bet.  But if that's the case, why doesn't he call the place Steve's French Press Coffee?  Either way, I won't be risking another stop here.

I've been out to Fibber Magee's a couple of times in the last few weeks and I am becoming a fan.  If you are in the mood for a pub/bar, this would be a fine choice.  The service has been consistently good so far, the beer cold and the food tasty.  I've been ordering the fish and chips, which has been mostly good.  The batter on the fish comes out nice and crisp, but can turn a little soggy if it sits on the plate too long.  Even a little soggy it was still edible, but you might eat the fish first to avoid this situation. My only other knock with the fish was that it was extremely greasy, but what else can you expect with fried foods?  The chips are pretty good, but nothing special.  Just your basic shoestring french fries.  While not perfect, the fish and chips was still quite tasty and as long as your not afraid of a little grease you'll probably enjoy them. The drinks were cold and my server made sure that I never ran dry.    Tip: Go for the lunch portion if you can.  The lunch portion is big enough, and the dinner portions tend to be a little pricey for bar food.

I am here late (11 PM) on a Friday. The food here is bar food, but they've done a good job with it. I made the mistake of ordering a pizza that had a lot of spice to it, and they replaced it on the spot and didn't even make me ask for it. They make sure you have everything you need (drinks, refills, etc). The service has been top notch.   The cherry on the top is the live music. Obadiah Parker was playing, and they are amazing. The music was easily heard and sounded great  but I could still say something to my wife without having to yell.   I had a great experience and will definitely return.

A couple of old students and friends of mine suggested this place to me.  I decided to stop in on a Saturday morning.  I was the only person in the place when I walked in.  The two employees were very nice and the place has a cool vibe.  Unfortunately, they gave me a sour shot in my Americano.  A friend of mine wants to meet me there for coffee early next week before he moves to China.  Maybe I'll re-review this place after I give it a second chance.  It's too bad the coffee was bad.  It seems like a nice place otherwise.

Yesterday afternoon I stopped into Cartel with a friend of mine to give them a second chance.  When we arrived the place was packed and loud.  I ordered a decaf Americano, which they couldn't do because they were out of decaf beans.  I consider this a major failure by the management.  I've never had this happen at any of the really good coffee places around town.    I ended up settling for an iced tea and my friend and I sat down and talked for a bit.  We ended up chatting with one of the other patrons for a while, but eventually ended up cutting our stay short because the place was so incredibly loud and there were some kids running around the place that were getting on our nerves.  I think the acoustics aren't very good in there and it seems like everyone's conversation gets amplified and thrown right in your face.  Rather than yell, we just gave up and moved on.    I have a feeling that Cartel will eventually end up being a great place, but based on my experience they need to work on their consistency.  The employees have seemed nice both times I've been there, but pouring a sour shot is unacceptable and so is running out of beans.  If they work on training their barristas and get their logistics together I am sure Cartel will eventually be a great place.  A little work on the acoustics of the place couldn't hurt, either.  I probably would have given them two stars, but we couldn't think of where to go after fleeing from Cartel and ended up at Starbucks.  For that, you get one star.

I wanted to get a special piece of equipment installed in my Lexus, that allowed me to use my smartphone on my car's touchscreen. Cool, huh? One of the companies recommended by Vais, the people that made the product, was Handcrafted Car Audio. I had just bought my Lexus, so there were a couple of other things I had done at the same time: Limo tint and remote start from my smartphone with unlimited range. Everything was installed perfectly. What inspired me to write this review is that even months after the installation was completed, Handcrafted Car Audio was there to help me with any questions I had.  The staff was professional, friendly and helpful.  I used to go to Best Buy for car audio, but never again. I am a customer of Handcrafted Car Audio for life.

Beckett's Table is a great combination of laid-back and upscale, with great service and even better food.  This is one of those places where you need to go hungry, because is you skip any course you will be doing yourself a disservice.  We started with the grilled cheese as an appetizer, which sounds very mundane.  Not so.  It comes with pancetta, four different cheeses, and a delectable roasted red pepper tomato soup for your dipping pleasure.  I selected the osso buco for my entree, and I was not disappointed.  I love osso buco and Chef Beckett did right by me.  I went with the chocolate dipped bacon s'mores for desert, and was transported to hog heaven.  I might have to book a stay at the local cardiac unit for after my next visit, but it will be worth it.
