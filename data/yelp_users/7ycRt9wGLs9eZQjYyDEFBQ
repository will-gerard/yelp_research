We came in expecting dim sum (although as I go through the yelp page I can't figure out why I would think that) but they didn't offer it at this location. No biggie, traditional canto food is always fine with me.   The stir fried garlic pea leaf was really good!  The veggies were fresh, it had a great salty garlikcy taste, and it wasn't overcooked or undercooked  Beef chow fun was one of the bests I've ever had..which is crazy cause I ate it all the time in HK. It's way better than the one at KJ Dim Sum in the Rio  Chicken wings - I don't remember the name of this but there was garlic and jalapenos. REALLY good...perfectly crispy and perfectly seasoned.  My Canto family is really picky about their Chinese food and this place was heavily praised. Would definitely come back

My godparents love this place and everytime we come to Vegas we always come here. Service is impeccable! I would take a few sips of water and someone would magically appear and refill it.  The mussels with the white wine and herbs are AMAZING! the sauce is so good that everyone at my table used sauce for their bread (also really good) instead of the butter  Since we had been eating ALL day I wasn't super hungry. I ordered the french onion soup and a side of green beans. The soup is very tasty but there is way too much bread....I'd like more soup, less bread! I'm a huge fan of green beans and I haven't had green beans I didn't like. What I do like is that they use hericot green beans instead of the thick waxy ones. A bit overcooked but seasoned extremely well.  I had a bite of the hangar steak and it was very good. I also had a bite of the salmon salad...also tasty. I also had some french fries....too thin to be texturally appealing but very tasty all the same. Yes, I had bites of everything from everyone at my table...that's why we're family right!?!?

For $20, I wasn't expecting a whole lot....   The decor was outdated and the selection was really limited. There was basically only two bars of stuff since one area was the same food on both sides. The food is edible.....'nough said.   I would stay away from the Mongolian beef- it's extremely salty and i don't even think it's beef. It CRUMBLES apart in your mouth.... One friend described it as they tried to make steak out of ground beef ...yuck.  Vegetable selection is limited to what I think may be packaged salad. Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.   The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.   The only reason I gave them more than one star was the lady who cleaned our table was uber friendly.

This a little shy of a 4 only because the lights kept going out in our room. We had the terrace sweet and when we first entered the light to the room where the toilet is would not turn on. Finally someone came to fix it. Then we came back from clubbing to find that the bathroom light wouldn't turn on... Irritating. Other than that the hotel is amazing. The decor is modern and a tad eclectic. There are good choices for restaurants and the rooms, aside from the broken lights, are gorgeous... I really like the parking structure  because the spots tell you what's open and what's not (I appreciate the little things in life) the dealers are super nice! I'm a gambling noob so it was great that our dealer took the time to explain the etiquette going into playing at the tables.  They also gave us a free $5 when we joined their identity membership cards...

Yay for buffets!   My friends and I came here after reading the reviews and we figured this place is only hyped up so we had to try it...   you have to walk forever just to get to it (we learned later that this long walk came in handy after the meal)   The decor is really nice and the staff us super friendly. They clean your plates asap and are really good about bringing the drinks  Selection is fairly good especially the desserts! Here's a list if my faves  -Korean short ribs -Watercress salad -Gnocci -Gelato -Choco covered strawberries...minus the oreos -Prime rib -Shrimp -Beef and Chinese broccoli (however, I only like the broccoli because its Chinese broccoli -My friend said the general Tso chicken was good and so was the salmon  They also have a whole slab of bacon... that they cut for you in thick slices.. ZOMG yummmm  I would pass on the sushi though. the rice us kind of hard and the selection sucks. Also Mac n cheese... Below what I expected. My least favorite was their eggs Benedict.... Too runny and too rough  Overall awesome experience although still prefer planet hollywood

This review is only for their happy hour  A girlfriend and I came for a girls' weekend and we were looking something light to eat for lunch knowing we'd probably go out for dinner.  Citrus Grilled Chicken Taco - Soooo tasty and they give you lots of meat. Ceviche Duo - Peruvian Ceviche was good but spicy; really great flavors but a little too much sauce. They also only give you two plantain chips so thank goodness for the free tortilla chips. Carribean Carpaccio is not your typical ceviche in the sense that's it's not chunky. I don't know what I was expecting considering it says carpaccio in the name - thin slices of fish as opposed to chunky salsa like. Still very tasty although I didn't care much for the celery leaf or red onions.  Sangria - I loooove Sangria but I usually prefer white Sangria. This one was red but not overly sweet with just enough alcohol for a lightweight like me.  Service was great. I'd take about two sips of water and someone would immediately come fill it.  Great first impression and I would definitely go back!
