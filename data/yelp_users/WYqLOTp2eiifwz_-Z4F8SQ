Great Restaurant for Breakfast.....I have breakfast here once every week!  The food is good, priced reasonably and the service is great!  Thanks to Adam, who always takes care of me.  As they say, Try It...You'll Like It!

Bob & Minute Man Cleaners are "Amazing"! Who would of thought that you get personal service with Dry Cleaning/Laundry Pick Up & Delivery at the same or less cost than other cleaners. Thanks for the Great Service Bob!

Great fast food fish & chips joint!  We agree ,  either  you  love  it  or  hate it. If you want  something  to  remind you of going eat after a HS game with friends ,  this is it. If you want restaurant  quality  food ,  don't go to Pirates ,  go to Red Lobster or Joe's Crab Shack .

Dr. Kaye & his staff are "Great"! Dr. Kaye has been our dentist for years now. It's always a relaxing and calming experience when my wife & I go in for our routine visits. Thank you to everyone in Dr. Kaye's Office!

I like the Big 5 Sports Stores, but the location on Arizona & Ocotillo just had poor service. The clerk wouldn't take my coupon that was emailed to me by their company. I asked them to scan the bar code so that they could verify the discount and they refused. So I walked out very upset! I will never go back to that store. The next day I went to the store on Rural & Southern and completed my purchase with the coupon and spent an extra $50 on World Cup gear. I know which store I will be giving my business to. ....

Wow, I  used the recommendations  to help me decide to try this place out. The food was not good.  The quality  was very poor. The fried rice was overcooked & very greasy . The entrees  were overcooked or were pre-cooked waiting for someone  to  order it. This was  the  first & last time we will eat here.  Even our kids could tell  that the food wasn't  very good .

Papa Murphys pizza is worth the price and effort to pick it up. Kids love the double cheese pizza. The staff  in Chandler are always helpful & friendly.

6 Stars! Great people (Steve  & Mike) & more importantly ,  Awesome, Honest & Affordable  Service! They took care of some Auto Warranty work that the dealership was overcharging for. Plus, they took care of some routine maintenance  at a reasonable cost. They are definitely  worth a visit if you need an honest auto repair  shop. Don't worry, the guys have a New York vibe about them....they talk fast, but work hard at doing it right  & try to save you money! Thank you Steve, Mike and the rest of the staff!
