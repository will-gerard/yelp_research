After a decent experience daughters first car there we thought it would be a great experience to get another after an unfortunate accident totaled it out less than 5 months later.  Boy were we wrong!    They decided it would be a great opportunity to take advantage of her in her moment of need and crisis.  They decided a young girl spending her own hard earned money and after a serious accident would be a ripe target to screw over.  They wouldn't even honor their own prices posted in the car.  Add on's and extras and additions pushed price before tax and fees well above msrp.   Manger "mo" could have been a hero just by cutting a fair deal but instead decided he would enjoy playing the villain preying on young girls.   I know they will come on to argue this so I kept their sheets and paperwork and would love to show them to the world to prove what a snake in the grass car salesman "mo" is.    Shame on big two Mitsubishi.

One of my very favorite places in town.  Great little patio with excellent view of the fountain and park.  Great consistent food, good drinks, excellent service.  Wife and I love to go late after work and relax and enjoy their food and atmosphere. .

Had another company come and tell me I needed a new system and quoted me a price over 6 thousands dollars.  Called efficiency for a second prove to compare, talked to Bob who while he was happy to Price out a new system install, encouraged me to have his repair staff come take a look first.. Figured for the price of a service call it was worth a shot.  Guy called first like they said he would, showed up exactly when he said he would, got right at it.. Within 20 minutes had my system up and working with 2 new parts. Less than 400.00 instead of thousands!. I don't know if they are the cheapest out there but they are honest. Instead of selling me a whole new system, they sold me only what it took to do the job right.  They earned my business.  Thanks Bob- Ryan

Best Italian in fountain hills.  Only real option in town.  Love the great food items they produce out of their wood fired brick oven.  We have eaten there dozens of times and never leave unsatisfied.  Wish they had some smaller less expensive items. They are all big meals and a little pricy. Sometimes a smaller meal would be great but that's a very minor thing. I'll be back for sure.

I'll never let them take any more of my money.  Service was rude, food was crap, drinks were wrong and when they finally got them right they were terrible.   The burgers arent any better than fast food and the side salads look like they were made in bulk the day before and frozen into the bowl.  Limp and wilted.   The Bartenders are slow, rude, and dont know how to mix drinks.  If you go stick to beer.  The only thing they cant mess up.

A friend in town invited us out and asked us to give then another try. Glad we did.  Many of the issues we had before have been fixed.  The food is better, the drinks are good. The staff are present and professional.    Glad we gave then another try.

Great mom and pop place for a Saturday afternoon burger.     Driving through a part of town I hadn't been in a long time abs saw the sign,  figured what the heck.  I'm so glad I gave it a shot.    Welcomed as soon as I walked in by the staff.  Ordered up the haven burger that comes with pastrami.  Was cooked up to order perfectly,  served up juicy and hot.  The kind of burger that melts in your mouth delicious.    For about 8 bucks total got a great sized burger,  piled with meat and pastrami,  fries and a drink.  For just a buck or 2 more than fast food I got an amazing burger, done perfect,  by friendly people.    I'm glad I stopped in, look forward to coming back.  I highly recommend haven burger to anyone who enjoys a great burger at great price.

I made the mistake of not checking Yelp before I used to this company. Boy did I ever pay for my mistake. Absolutely disgraceful work I cannot believe the shoddy quality of the workmanship the really terrible experience with the company. I had a leaking pipe coming out of my pool I jack hammered up my own deck to expose the leak and then made the mistake of having them come finish the job based on a coupon I had received in the mail. I asked them to repipe the entire side expecting that they would be professional enough to complete the job appropriately.  After refilling the pool and turning it on my yard promptly flooded,  couple thousand gallons of water due to improper glued pipes.    Calling the company for days got me no response till I get a frantic call from my wife about strange men in my back yard.  They just showed up and let themselves in.  I finally got ahold off a company rep and set up a time to come look at it while I was home.  He admitted the job was crap but offered no solutions or ways to correct the problem.    I asked for an owner or gm to contact me on this and never got any response.  In fact the only one I ever heard from was the billing lady who professed to be cutting me a deal.  Reduced the bill from almost 800 estimate to 417.87. No regard for my experience,  the hundreds of dollars of wasted water,  the damage to my yard. ..    Please do yourself a favor,  do not let these hacks near your home or pool,  they only want your money.  By far the worst company I have had the displeasure of having any interactions with in a very long time.
