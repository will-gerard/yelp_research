I love coming here! Probably the best dive bar in Tempe. Great prices and specials, lots of pool tables, karaoke, and awesome wings!! If you like them grilled try Jan's Style!

Let me start by saying I love Wingstop wings. I honestly would have them in any city that I visit. Lol That being said, this location as far as service has really gone downhill. It's sad. Wings are still solid, but the service is subpar.

Oh My Goodness!!! Scot is an absolute guru!! The service was quick and efficient, he comes to you and is completely capable of handling any of your needs, he has extensive knowledge and experience...Bery easy to speak with and I literally was outside watching and talking about the bike for about 99% of the time he was working on it, no sweat. It was a great experience, I waited until after I rode a while to post, but I have to say, the bike feels better than ever and I'll be working with Scot in the future, for sure!
