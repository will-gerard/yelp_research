Needed tulips delivered the afternoon I called in. Done. Easy.   I got a grip of tulips in a heavy glass vase wrapped in nice paper and displayed wonderfully delivered to my girlfriend at her work same day for under $100. She's happy. I'm happy. BAM.  Girl on the phone was very nice; I called in around 10am. She mentioned she was getting a fresh delivery later that morning so the delivery would be after noon, which was fine as long as they landed before 4pm.  They were delivered around 2p.   She mentioned the delivery guy wasn't the most happy person but wasn't bad.   I'll use them again. :)

Love speedway.... pretty cool track layout and they're not AS freakish about some rubbin-is-racin here.... they'll get on you about it but if you're cool with it they'll let some slide once they know you're a decent driver.  They have great coupons sometimes in the local clipper things or even on their site (which I just updated the yelp listing to include).   Karts here are good, but there always seems to be one or two dogs in the group so hope you don't get stuck with one of those.  You'll get about 13-15 laps after 3 hotlaps to qualify.  They'll line you up in a grid format for a flag drop and off you go.  Cool because only faster riders are in front of you... until you start to lap ppl :)  Great for groups... partys... etc.  After each race they have print outs of each lap and everybody's time so you can see where you screwed up and on what lap or know who to blame for you +3 sec lap time because they kept getting in your way ;)  Here are the discounts:  http://www.speedwayraceway.com/discounts.htm

F1 is pretty sweet... cost is a little much but it's expensive to maintain all those karts and run a huge building and I'm sure the insurance is a killer too...   Aside from that the racing is usually good as long as you go with your own group and don't get somebody who can't drive or at least understand to let you pass if they're all over the track with no driving line.  (Sorry technical racer here).  Best nights (though busy) are when the open up the dividers and make the two tracks into one big one... SUPER technical and way too much fun.  This is good for groups too as I know they have business team building events available.  We've done the beginning of a bachelor party here and birthdays a plenty  There's food there, though expensive and just typical bar food so eat prior to coming (just don't lose your cookies).    There's an arcade too for kids or whoever's waiting to race.  I think they had a climbing wall in there too... random?

I love South Mountain...   okay lover moment aside...  What do you want to do? -- Hike? cool tons of trails for ya from easy to hard... -- Bike? road or mountain, we got both for ya.  Mtn goes from flat very fast trails to very very technical XC rides to some killer downhill/vert stuff.  Road has great views and one sunday/mo they shut road down to motors so get a wide open road all to yourself -- Views?  heck yes, you'll have to hike a bit if you want distance but if you're looking for nature - tons here and plenty of places to get away from ppl traffic also to have a very quiet place to sit and think.   Funny thing about South... is it seems almost everybody has their own favorite place to go while there.  The low flat trails get a little busy but that's easy stuff, if you want to be alone work a little bit and you get away from 95% of the traffic.  Everybody seems to have a "secret" spot too they like to hike and get away... I've got one that my buddy and I know of that when we get up there... there's a point at which we keep going and we've only seen like 2 other ppl go that far back into the canyons... so it's always a very peaceful run and can even look down onto the main trails and watch people down there too.  South is great... I need to mess around more on the west side of the mountain but I live in Ahwatukee so I'm on the east side and just ride over there.  They do close some of the lesser known trails from time to time to get the wildlife back in and get some growth back in, and other than once getting lost on a close trail I've never had issues.  The park rangers I've met there are always nice, always asking how the trails were and making sure ppl are safe.  Probably not the smartest idea, but I love to run when there's a storm rolling in... just love going out there and thinking and being alone...

Killer lunch specials that are hard to beat... always coupons in local papers and clipits for dinners as well.  I've been to Abacus about 8 times now and have failed to leave a review for them so here's the breakdown.  Food is good... probably not the best I've ever had but definitely nothing wrong with any of the meals I've had there, and I've never eaten the same thing twice as I've been trying to eat different things each time.  Their menu is pretty big and can get a little confusing for somebody with ADD like me but hey you get a lot of good stuff to choose from.  Service is always very prompt and they're very nice as well.  Cost is average, but like I said, get the coupons from local papers...   All in all, I like Abacus and I'll continue to frequent there when I'm in my chinese food moods :)

I've heard way good stuff about this place for a while and finally had the pleasure of sitting down and having some lunch there.  Thoughts: Staff was friendly and quick, nice place, very clean and some hi-tops and lots of tables and outdoor seating as well.  Chicken salad bagel sandwich wasn't too bad at all, except for the nuts in it - I'd probably eat it again however.  Had a tomato basil bagel toasted with it... yum!  I'm wanting to go back to try different menu items now :)

SMC helped me a ton when nobody else knew what I was talking about in trying to order a part for my Specialized with aftermarket forks.  Out of 5 shops, the guy on the phone was the only one who knew exactly what I was talking about and told me he could special order them ASAP.  There was an issue with the order that wasn't SMC's fault but they called me right away to let me know, and every time I called they were on top of it and got me a sitrep asap.  When I did get the part everybody was super nice and apologetic (wasn't needed but nice anyways).  As for bike selection... they have some of the best brands and no cheap crap - if you want the best you head to SMC.  It's cool because if you go in there you're already going wanting good stuff, not a $400 walmart bike so they take a lot of time with you and answering my tons of questions :)  Very cool guys and girls over there... head in and check em out!

It's been over two years since my first review of SMC, I've since bought a new mountain bike from them and have had routine service there - and my review stays at a 5 star without question.  I spent a lot of money there because they take the time to deal with my indecisiveness in dropping $3k. I had other options and I was shopping around including online but my decision came down to them. They're local, they ride the trails I ride, they're extremely experienced and knowledgable and seem to give a shit with my hundreds of questions I had in 26 vs 29, brain vs no brain, chassis geometry, this rear set with that shifter etc... like endless knowledge of everything they stock and more.  It came down to ordering a brand new 2011 or taking the last 2010 upper model in the shop. After some talking I walked out with the more upgraded 2010 model. I got a great price, had it in-hands and didn't have to wait the 4+ months to get the new one and I was stoked.  Recently I brought her in for routine maintenance, left it there after my ride on a sunday and was back in hands tuesday afternoon. It went in dirty and grimy - came out like a million bucks :) Like seriously as clean as the day I bought it...   Anyways - they care, they have only the best bikes there and evidently the best help, and that is why I spend my money there and recommend them to you.  Ride hard kids...

I've enlightened a few people to this place recently (previous 2 reviews before me lol) and I've been going there for a couple years now.  1 of 2 best Gyros in Az... hands down.  Best gyros since moving away from Chicago...  Prices are extremely fair and the staff is always really nice.  Lots of seating too!

This is one of the cleaner and newer feeling Waffle Houses... other than it being really cold in there most of the time... I like it, girl doesn't :)  Food is always good, ladies are always very nice. Typical waffle house... I have no issues here and have visited this location many many times and will continue to return.  oh and 24/7... hellz ya!

Not all Waffle Houses are the same, this one always seems a little bit better. Food is solid, service is excellent and friendly and they're always open! LOVE IT.   I mean a Waffle House is pretty much a Waffle House... but this location was a regular haunt for me and my friends for years when I lived in 'Tukee... I don't live close by anymore but when I'm nearby I wouldn't hesitate to stop by. It's much nicer of a location than the one on baseline & I-10

Not by any means an Indian food expert, nor have I been to more than 3 Indian places.  I was craving some Naan (that awesome flatbread) and talked to my good friend (who's Sikh) and he recommended this place as it was local to me and he had had a good experience there - and if he says it's good I listen.  She even asked me on a 1-5 scale how hot I wanted the food... 3 totally but could have done 4 probably :)  It's in a dark corner of the plaza and the price was higher than I was expecting but the food totally made up for it.  The safest thing I could get is Chicken Tikka Masala, which tears me up anyways but I love indian food (don't think indian food is meant for skinny white guys.. just sayin).    Bottom line... girl on phone was very helpful and very nice, the guy at the front desk was very welcoming and nice and they even offered me drinks for waiting like 3 minutes for my food to be done (was doing take-out).  Felt very welcome there and everybody was friendly.  Got home, everything wrapped and sealed up nicely as for no spillage in the car and the naan was wrapped in reynolds wrap.   Food was great... bread warm and fluffly, chicken cuts were very tender and moist and the rice was perfect fluffliness.  I'm totally going back... but I need to give my body a break... I'm payin for eating Indian food...  but it was so worth it!

So much better than Subway or the other pretenders.  A 9-inch sandwich for $6.75 is awesome and more than enough food, and not just a bread filler.  Locally owned, I met the guy today at lunch and actually told him about Yelp so he'll be checking his reviews out, but he was really nice as were the guys taking orders and making the food.  This place gets busy at lunch as the business people around know where to eat when it's good.  I've heard a few of my cop buddies say how good it is too and they weed out all the bad places pretty quick.  Anyways, the sandwiches are really good and all the meat, cheeses and all the fixin's are really fresh and always plentiful on your sandwich.  And look for the "Bobby"... It's like your whole Thanksgiving dinner exploding in your mouth... turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce... I'm serious it's so good.  Enjoy guys... it's really good food for a great price.

I haven't been to one of these in a looong time...   Took my girl and a buddy of mine out tonight and had some good breakfast...  All 3 of us with tip ran me $37... not shabby.  - Lots of food... I had breakfast  - GOOOOOOOD maple syrup... damn I could eat those pancakes w/ that syrup all frickin day - still can't get into grits... idk wtf they're so popular for *shrug* - eggs... sunny side up... goood - hashbrown casserole?  I'd rather have normal hashbrowns but the new twist wasn't too shabby... good - coke... (yes it's important) good...  proper amt of fiz - biscuits & gravy... superb. - Cinnamon Apples... NOM!  Again Price was good... I expected it to cost more honestly.  Service... great!  Guy was really nice and patient with our indecisiveness (mostly my ADD)  I'm not into the shopping area with all the kids toys and antiques... stuff my mom would love... to each his own...  I'll be back

very close to a 5...  so a 4.5 but yelp fails at halves  Only reason prevented me from a 5 is that it's more of a family place and traditional setting that I'd like to hang out with friends at... lots of kids... sorry I can't do the screaming thing.  Food wise... chips and salsa are SOO frickin good.  I used to stop by on my way home once a week and buy a big bag of chips and a big thing of their salsa...   Cookin is always good and comes out pipin hot exactly as ordered and I always order custom style and they have no problem making it the way I want it.  I've been going here for years and will continue to do so.  Also this one is better than the one on University.

Very solid 4... and here's why not a 5...  I hate when places charge an extra .50c for using a debit card, it's not credit, you don't get dinged for charging a debit card, quit charging me!  They also charge extra for refills if you want one... but they do have HUGE mongous cups so that's not a big worry.  Pretty much the best orange chicken I've ever had though, and for a fast food type place - it's the best.  The sauce is just so damn good.   I've also had yaki soba from here and that was delish  Just a quick good meal for lunch and/or dinner... been many times - I'll be back

Heard about this from the girl who read it in the east valley trib so wanted to try it out.  Now it's pretty hard to screw up a hamburger but this place is above average in terms of a good burger.  Everything is very fresh and I like the ample cheese applied w/o my asking - just a good 'ol American burger.  Staff very nice... interior very old school deco... kind of a dive but not dirty at all and wasn't an issue at all for us.  I've also heard rave reviews of their breakfasts so I'm going to make another trip back.

No long lines, no DMV, excellent personal service!  Okay i'm going off one trip and 1 services rendered BUT... hear me out.  So the day I NEEDED to reg my new truck was Presidents day right?  DMV is closed... my 3-day permit just expired and I'm on borrowed time and am busy...   Somebody, forgot who, told me of this place... called - they were open!!! score  Went in and sat down and the two nice ladies helped me very quickly, some small talk - very nice and helpful.  Even got a specialized plate AND personalized... they got everything correct and over the next few weeks I got all my stuff from the state and everything was good.  I'll never go to the DMV again - unless that's the only place I get it done at :/

I just edited the biz info as this is the old address and didn't have hours and stuff site url and stuff.  I like Cycle Gear... and here's why...  They're WAY cooler and much nicer than the guys at Ride Now and cheaper.  Like anything you should shop around but they give discounts to military and PD/FD so works for me there.  They have pretty good deals on tires honestly, and bring the old wheel/tyre in and they'll mount the new one for you.  I had a jacket that was, about a month later I just decided it was too big and I didn't want it anymore... they took it back and special ordered me a new one.  Later I bought a Dianese Santa Monica jacket on sale that was much cheaper than anywhere else had it.  The guys there are all riders and very knowledgeable with any question I've ever asked them.  Always a good convo anyways when I go in there.  Brought the girl in and she got her jacket there too.  And they do street and dirt gear too btw.

Solid and consistently great food!  I've been to this place numerous times over the last 6 years and recently moved back in the neighborhood and I wasn't let down. Consistently good food and a great price. Really can't go wrong here at all.  I always got to go... inside is all tile and not super comfortable but again.. you're getting quick Chinese food at a good price - ambiance isn't their thing.   Oh they also have a drive-through == awesome.

First off - it's Chipotle... super good grub - nuff said.  With this particular Chipotle, which is closest to my house, I was greeted with thanks and a few questions about my experience using their new ordering system.   Which one is that?  The new Chipotle iPhone app!  App is obviously in the itunes app store and free.  Open it up, finds the closest location to you and has the whole menu to where you can build your order and submit it to them and if you'd like even pay right online with your iphone....  SWEEEET...   So downloaded the app, ordered and drove down there to meet a buddy and walked to the front of the line and grabbed my burro, paid (because I was lame and closed the app before I could enter my visa) and the guys were all making sure the app and ordering process were to my liking.  While eating the guy asking everybody how the food was made his way over to me and asked me a few questions about the process.  Either way good experience and I will be using their iPhone ordering again in the future... order was correct as ordered and simple as pie.

You know, I have nothing against this location but more of an issue with the food of the place in general. Is it always so bland?  It's never that flavorful to me and I've been there like 12 times with different people and have tried different things.  My roomate loves it but I'm just not a big fan honestly.  The location is clean and staff friendly and bustling but I just don't like the food.

Not that you can compare Firebird to anywhere else in Az but I have been to Joliet Raceway in Chicago (and even though that's newer) I like the arrangement of Firebird and the availability of the different tracks available to race on.  First off...  NHRA... come on... hands down one of THE coolest events in Az ever, next to NASCAR and well pro any sports but the 8000hp cars come only once a year.  The pits are setup nice so every ticket gets into the pits to check out the teams and cars, beer and food are expensive but what else is new.  They also have drag racing events, any type of racing event, drift, road, moto races, dirt bikes, monster trucks, top fuel drag boats on the lake... I'm sure I'm missing a lot but nowhere else has this in Az.  Parking is always good to go... driving out of there just takes a while as you've got one main road that you get on to funnel onto the I-10 but not much they can do about that.  Great place... keep bringing in the NHRA and letting us use the road tracks for our motorcycles and I'll be happy.

Probably the best Chicago style food and by far the best Chicago Dogs I've had in Arizona...  Nuff said!  Menu is very fairly priced and make sure to get the Vienna beef Chicago dogs... ugh sooo good.  table/booth seating and a few bar type seats up front along the window.   Al is usually manning the front and/or register so be sure to say hi...  Very friendly staff and plenty of Chicago swag around the walls to check out.  Definitely check out Al's... very good food!

NAPA is always the best.  They have stuff that autozone and checker just don't carry... and very normally much cheaper than the dealers.  Needed some cabin filters for the xterra today - they were the only guys in town that had em and for a great price too.  Autozone was twice the price and they had to order them.  Dealer was way over what I paid at NAPA...  always will be back when I need stuff

Can't even bother to elaborate...   Batting cages are horrible... nuff said... look out in the baseball ones as they throw pretty crazy and the softball lanes are pretty non-accurate nor are they consistent.  The balls are really hard so don't bring a bat you wanna not crack.  The karts are shitty... even for lame little kid karts...   Food is super gross, didn't play minigolf or games.  Pretty lame for a "fun" place

First off... LOVE the fried mushrooms and fried pickles... honestly can't really find those anywhere else around - not that i've seen.  Wings are always good though I do have a issue with the amount of hard breading that's on the boneless chicken wings... always seems excessive.   Salsa seems to change temperature, the girl says sometimes it's too hot for her, but mostly is the same. Different cooks perhaps?   Celery costs extra = lame... it's frickin celery... Anyways, at least they don't charge for refills lol... (yet).  Location is great for college/pro sports as it's packed and always some good cheering going on... fun to be there during games.  Place gets packed during UFC fights too fyi.  Cool basketball arcade game too!  Lots of TV's too

Mow Power has guys that know a lot and got me the parts I needed quickly.  I bought a lawn mower off craigslist... and she needed some TLC...   Called around and everybody just wanted to sell me a new blade when all I wanted was to get it sharpened....   Mow Power did it for $6 - woot! Grabbed a couple parts, asked a question about the rebuild that they answered with some good info and I was off.  I like that these guys know their shit and I can get in and out w/o a pitch.      I also saw a few crews coming in to get their stuff serviced and buy some parts.  It's a contracter type place... probably not for moms or basic homeowners - just sayin

We eat here constantly for lunch - fast - consistent - awesome mexican food and bomb pastry's too. Those cone things... get one... you can thank me later.  They do take debit and good chips and salsa while you wait but I've never had a lunch order come out more than ~6 min wait. refills on cokes and chips and a small little dining area but it's classic chandler hole in the wall with awesome food.  You have to go here

It's funny because I lived in Chandler for years, drove past this place tons of times and always said I wanted to try it out... never did, until last thursday.  I went back that day for dinner also... soo good.  Went with a few friends to check it out and I've gotta say it was the best shrimp taco and shrimp burrito I've probably ever had including Rocky Point.  The baja style food was so good, reminded me of being IN rocky point.  The sandy outdoor patio with the little straw umbrella cabana type tables are awesome and make you not want to go back to work while at lunch.  Only weird thing is they only take cash... They have an ATM inside that charges $2 to take money out but if you give them a receipt of your ATM transfer they'll give you a $2 coupon for your next visit - and don't worry because you'll want to go back.  It's a taco shop, but it's not dirty or anything.  Get in there and enjoy!

Great locally owned biz, very competitive prices even against online competition and best customer service evar.... These guys know just about everything about helmets and even let you test stuff and have a great return policy...  Bottom line... they help you find the helmet you need and want and get you out the door with a smile.  Highly recommended

I was really surprised at this little local place.  I don't drink coffee so when friends mentioned it as a lunch place I kind of didn't want to go, but I'm sure glad I did.  The food was very fresh and very good, sandwiches mostly that I noticed.  No fountain drinks, only cans of soda and bottles of other stuff. Their smoothies rocked too!

Flickas is great, we get the softball team to head over after games on tuesdays to eat up some of those shrimp tacos that are so damn good. Everybody is really nice that works there, talkative; $2 Coronas are good and cold and there's always something good on the TV's if you want to watch sports. Chips and salsa are super good too.   I like it cause it's not a typical snobby scottsdale place and the mix of people and ages are pretty diverse.  You've gotta love the salt water aquariums too.   Anyways - check it out - good stuff.  And if you see the crazy guy with shoulder length hair - that's Flicka - he's super talkative and a really nice guy - say Hi! They have a site but it needs some web developer love from me:  http://flickasbajacantina.com/

My only real problem is that parking is limited but you can park down the streets, which at times can get to be far away but if you can't walk a block or two for good food and beer then you suck anyways.  The Hefeweizen is the best in the valley hands down and yes I've tried everything I've come across here. The burgers and sandwiches are awesome and the salads are good too.  I saw a review that said the atmosphere was too much of a sports bar?  Eh not so much.  I mean there's a few TV's with sports on but NOT the typical sports bar visitors at all.    I'm not a dark beer fan but I hear the Kilt Lifter is awesome and the winter ale when it's available is awesome too.  I have a friend that always orders the ice cream beer drink with some dark beer and she loves that a ton.  Overall just a great place to sit and chill and have some good food and great beer.  Go visit.  Do it, do it.

Don't judge a book by it's cover here... the only signage is "pizza" out front... and there's only two small tables with some plastic chairs inside and I wouldn't recommend eating there just because of the traffic of people coming in and out and waiting for food..    There's just a big counter when you walk in and the guys are just working away.   First off... WINGS ARE FANTASTIC... they're meaty and the sauces are great and whatever rub they use on them are just really good even w/o dipping sauces in my opinion.  Breaded mushrooms ftw... so good and a great compliment to any takeout order.  Never had the pizza yet but from what I hear that's great too.  Best thing too... they're open LATE, which I get off work late and most places are closed so... sucks for me but I can always call in and pick up and i'm good to go.  Little local hole in the wall with great food. Do it.

Universal Police Supply is a local resource for LEO (law enforcement officers), security guys, etc to get their gear from.  There are online places but UPSco seems to have everything you'd need and they're local and as cheap if not cheaper than most online places.  Duty clothes and boots that are good for any rugged job, tactical knives, flashlights, holsters and gear bags - they've got all that stuff and more.  They do alterations and tailoring and I'm pretty sure they can do the embroidery and screen printing stuff in-house as well.  Good place and the only one locally to get the high quality products and brand names.

After walking throughout the Venetian and checking out St. Marks Square near the Gondola ride we came upon Canaletto...  The "outdoor" patio (in the faux outdoor square but still cool) sucked us in to look at the menu and the spaghetti with maine lobster preeeeettty much sealed the deal with me haha.  We made reservations on the spot for 2100 and came back later after we had got dressed up.  Fresh baked bread with oil & balsamic vinegar to start it off and some wine for the lady and agua for me (don't drink wine really).  The girl serving us was super preggo but really nice and on the ball.  I got that Spaghetti with Maine Lobster and it was gooooooooood... nom nom.  Spaghetti was really buttery but feck it... it was good man - I'll just run an extra mile ;)   Girl got a chicken breast that had some spicy honey mustard kind of stuff but was good, I think she thought it was mediocre.  Skipped dessert actually but the price was fair for nice dining in Vegas.  My lobster thing was $37 and with 2 wine glasses for the girl and nice tip I got out for about $110.  Not bad for Vegas... and cheaper than where we were going to go.  I'll definitely go back in the future.

I'm very happy with our stay at the Mirage.  There's a Deli in the casino called the Carnegie Deli, little expensive but I was surprised at the amount of food!  jeeez!  My ham and egg sandwich was humongous... like an omelet on bread with cheese... soo good too.  The room was really nice and fresh lookin? as in modern and clean.  We were south wing, 3rd floor, single bed.  I'm reading these reviews of small bathrooms... eh it wasn't huge but my girlfriend and I fit in nicely and the shower was roomy and there was enough counter space for all her stuff so... seems good to me.  The bed was really comfy... one of those pillow-top posterpedic things I think.  The aquarium is sweet.. so want a 1/10th of that in my house :)  We also went out back to the Tigers and lions and dolphin thing.  $15/ea wasn't that much damage and got reeeeaaally up close to the dolphins.  There was just a baby born a couple months back too so got to see that.  Also there was Java, a 9 week old leopard that was cool to see - don't get many of those. Out with the younger tigers there was a trainer guy inside the pen answering tons of questions and giving some really useful information about the tigers and how they care for them, where those ones came from (Florida evidentally) and he was cool to have around for inquiring minds.  Overall I really enjoyed our stay at the Mirage and I'll be back in the future.

Expensive but so much fun!  Located inside NY NY this is a typical dueling piano bar just x3 dollars :)  Two bars to stumble to for drinks.  Seems like there's always more dudes there but there's always hot chicks for the single guys.  My girlfriend had never been to Vegas and I decided to take her here for her first night out and we had so much fun.  Great songs always to sing along with and especially towards the end of the night - everybody sings with so it's not like a lame Karaoke bar.  Always a great mix of people in here from everywhere and everybody always seems friendly also.  The Crown Royal flows like waterfalls, which keeps me happy :)  Tips make the songs play and the piano guys always seem to get some sort of theme going on, especially towards the end of the night and will usually put two groups present against each other.  Like that night there were a bunch of guys from Ireland and some chicks from Canada... the piano guys basically said whatever side's song gets the most points (dollars) will play as the final song of the night... Irish won ;)  Cover I think was $15 for standing side and $25 for sitting side... I'd say stand and have more fun.  Sitting side always looks more boring anyways.  They're open till 0300, which for some reason is a good time to start walking to a great breakfast place. I think we made it to a place in the flamingo or something.  Anyways... party on wayne :)

Awesome!  Visual eyegasm!  My best advice is to LOOK UP and around as soon as you walk in...  The stuff they've built and have everywhere is just insane.  The whole theatre isn't all that huge so you'd be able to see everything from anywhere BUT... I'd say get tix down near the front and center... We had section 102 (middle) and 7th row (G) and they were perfect seats.  You can feel the heat from the flames but not too hot and the ariel parts happen RIGHT ABOVE YOU... it's so cool.  An isle seat may be cool because of the guys always running around and staging in the isle to run up stage.  Engineering alone is mind boggling...  The different stages that come up from below and move around, tilt, rotate, etc and then these huge towers move around all over... I want to watch a "how it's made" on that show... it's friggin nuts and its hard to impress me.  The fighting scenes were sweet, the costumes were really cool and unique, and even the guys not in the show were dressed up and completely in character and interact with you a lot actually.  NO Cameras! lol...  the people that did take some pics totally got harassed by the people of Ka... actually really funny though.  Anyways... crazy overload on the eyes... and if you're up front you get snowed on a little and flower petals all over :)  Oh and the seats have two speakers inside them behind your head... sweeeet...  The girl loved it and I'm glad I bought tix... HINT:  I found 25% off coupon online so look for one of those before your purchase... saved me almost like $80 so it's worth your time.

A definite MUST stop at while in Vegas.  It's Jimmy Buffett's place, I mean who wouldn't love it?  Very chill and laid back place, LOTS of room.  Third floor bar(s) are cool because you get to look over the strip and watch all the stuff going on and stuff driving by.  Drinks are a plenty, order whatever you can think of, they'll make it.  Food is awesome.  I've heard the Ahi was dry but order a friggin Cheeseburger in Paradise because there's a song made after that - so you kind of have to :)  It's always a little busy but just get in there and have fun.  The staff is always nice and fun too.

I haven't been to this place in about 5 years or so, last time I was here was when their location was over on university.  They got moved out by Tempe selling that location to build a high-rise condo thing that failed and now that location sits as an empty lot (except for one building)  Anyways.... went here for a lunch meeting suggestion.  Place was pretty busy, we didn't have to wait to get a table but it looked packed all the way back at lunch time on a friday.  Good deco. Clean. Very busy mill ave vibe. Lots biz lunch meetings going on and yet it remained a good volume in there to have a meeting and hear everything fine still.  Ordered food and got it out on the table fast.... no I mean like FAAAAST!  I didn't time it but it couldn't have been more than a couple of minutes MAX.  Like FAST.  Okay you get it I know.  Service was very friendly as well.  Hard to explain but the food was light... most mexican food you walk out feeling like you have a bowling ball in your gut... Not here... It didn't seem greasy like most places and everything up to the tomatoes were very fresh and crisp.  They used Asadero cheese on top, which is super good, not many places use it anymore.  Not the Gringo cheese you get like at macayos or anything.  The rice was really good and flavorful too.  To view the flip side of this review... I wasn't a big fan of the chips and salsa. Chips seemed semi-fresh but really thick, I like a lighter tortilla.  The salsa was just a red sauce.... tomato sauce with some heat... no chunks...  It seems to go with the "light" theme I mentioned earlier but I ended up not eating much of it at all - just wasn't my thing.  I like fresh tomatillos onion etc etc....  If we could do half reviews this would be a 3.5.  I gave them the shove to 4 because Restaurant Mexico is kind of a downtown Tempe staple - they've been around a long time and that's gotta count for something in this town.

Seriously I could have killed a cow and cooked my own burger faster than my one order came up...  I have to say the burger was good tho, when I actually got it... all the stuff seemed very fresh.  If you're in a hurry... don't bother... got time to burn, give it a whirl :)

Joe's is the best option for BBQ in Arizona (valley) that I've had...  However it doesn't compare to a few of the best I've had in Texas BBQ or Kansas City stuff...  Sorry!  Joe's a cool dude and I appreciate what he does here locally and with his other places nearby but I do like coming here and will continue to do so.  It's locally owned and that's worth my biz.  Home made root beer is pretty good but not my fav.  Slaw is really good, kudos there, as is the mac-n-cheese w/ crusty top.  Beans are key and they're good here as well.  Brisket is above average and the BBQ sauce comes a little thin in my opinion but after you pick up your tray there's a spot where you can add as much as you want. Pulled pork is exceptional and more so what I lean to when coming here.  The chicken is good too.  Swing out and sit down.  If you've had The Salt Lick or similar in Texas you won't be blown away. But if you've never had good BBQ this will blow your socks off.

Very cool place to go and chill out and get away from the lights and hustle and bustle of the strip and casinos.  After a very brief intro speech to the park you pretty much get to wander and see what you want when you want.  You can sit on a small wall and be like a foot away from the dolphins that come up when the trainers are there.  I'd like to do that "be a trainer for a day" but I'm not sure how much that'd cost - kinda scared to ask.  There was a 9 week old leopard cub that was there so we got to see him, "Java" (see pics link) and there were give younger tigers in one section too with a trainer inside answering questions.  The guy was way cool and super helpful about all the questions people were throwing at him.  Also white tigers, white lions, black panther, leopards, and out of left field was some alpaca's...  Going underneath the pool and watching the dolphins zip around is always cool to me at least.  One of them just had a baby a few months back too so there was a little one (see pics link).  It's no zoo by any means for but $15 bucks it's totally worth it.  I've got our pictures up here: http://is.gd/hEl9

Solid 4. The food is always good no matter what I've had there over the years. Bean dip & salsa are awesome and always complimentary.   Best thing about Serrano's is for lunch - they're very fast. Sadly unlike most of downtown chandler, Serrano's is fast and very nicely priced for lunch items. Staff is on top of things, drinks never empty and chips/dip never out. It makes for a great quick group lunch during the work week. Other places seem to take 1.5hrs in/out time.  No five simple because the scene is old, quiet and well... old. It's not bad, it's clean but just been there forever kind of old. There's no hipness to it, would never go there to drink at the bar,   I've been going to this location and others for years now and will continue to do so. Enjoy!

How is it possible I've never done a review for CK's yet?  I live right next to it and eat there like once a week and had a huge birthday bash there... whaaaaaat?   Wow... so anyways.. here's my review.  GO THERE :)  done.  Srsly tho... awesome food... the friday fish fry kicks ass and isn't expensive and you can choose between cod and perch.  The breakfast burritos and stuff are good and they have some pretty decent drink specials... only one I remember off hand is $2 Blue Moon pints all day Saturdays... yum!  The live bands are always good, two pool tables, bunch of flat panels everywhere you look, huge outdoor patio with misters and TV's again, and they even have some arcade games towards the back.  Staff... always friendly... never had one person in there be bitchy or short or anything... very nice crew they got working there.  I see a TON of regulars too meaning there's some good local culture in there.  Anyways... had no idea I've never done a review for them yet... sorry CK's! lol...   I'll see ya in there!

Fastest and Most Affordable lunch in downtown Chandler  Every day I search for lunch in downtown Chandler. I'm a creature of habit as most of us are and therefore I tend to stick to the same place when I find something good - I try not to but sometimes it happens.  I've walked passed In Pockets... hundreds of times? scary but probably. I haven't given it much thought as it's been tagged as a bakery and I'm not into sweets and stuff. However, they've been putting out signs on the sidewalk about breakfast (another thing I don't do) and sandwiches for lunch as well. Long story short I decided to venture back in (tried it once in October) and thought it was ok.  This place is very undervalued for as good as it is and not as well known as it should be. That needs to change. This is by far the fastest lunch in downtown Chandler and one of two most affordable. (not counting fast food crap).   For about $8 there are a variety of great deli sandwiches and chicken breast on focaccia or other great breads. Lots of different gourmet sandwich variations and all fill me up for that amount. Their bread is excellent, soft and warm and even the ciabatta was perfect and not hard like it typically is at most places.  The pasta salad was superior. The locale is nice, good inside seating and very friendly and attentive owner and workers taking your order and bringing the food out to your table.  I'm not a coffee guy but I know a few people at Gangplank that walk down here and get their cup of joe and mocha stuff here - if they like it from here it must be good. They also make cakes and pastries and all that stuff - again, not a sweets guy but it all looks good in the window.  I'm most definitely making In Pockets a more common visit for lunch each week. And they have a punch card too for loyalty rewards.

This place may have been awesome when it first opened but it's dirty and is very unmaintained.  Crap everywhere, lake stinks w/ stagnant water, grass... well isn't - it's dirt/mud instead...  Two different occasions my dog has gotten sick from this place but is fine in other dog parks... Hasn't eaten anything either - I can directly attribute her sickness / puking to that dog park.  After I started talking with others regarding the same thing - I heard similar stories of their dogs getting sick, getting rashes and who knows what else.  It's not maintained at all, they don't close down one side to let it recover... just a mess.  I refuse to take my dog there anymore.  Nuff Said

I work downtown and frequent The Tavern quite often for lunch.  They've recently expanded their food choices and I've tried a LOT from their menu and really have yet to disagree with anything I've eaten there.  All the food I've had is very good, which is why I return over and over again.  The employees are friendly and always more than willing to have a conversation.  The Tavern has a very cool local feel to it and there's a lot of regulars that consistently return.  On the weekends the line does get long but it's a great place to sit on the patio, and if you smoke (which I don't however) there's the back patio where you can still do that.

I buzz my head about once every week. My clippers died. You can see my problem.  I was told by numerous friends of my girlfriend that Sally's was the place to go to buy better equipement... or so they put it, "where the pro's go"... ok  Walk in, they have like 10 different clippers that to me look the same sans some flashy packaging. I asked the lady standing there what the difference in them was. I swear to you she turns and looks at them and points at them and says "Well this one is good, this one is good too, and this one is better"...   Are you f*cking kidding me? Really??? So I say "what is better about them? like better parts that last longer, better cutting blades, better speed variation or depth settings... like what is better?" She gave me a confused look and... I'm not joking said "well these ones are really good and this one is good too but not as good"...  OMG lady...  She handed me like 4 different boxes/brands - which I'm assuming she wanted me to figure out what was "better" about them.    I looked at a few and nothing was very similar to my last ones so I just looked at pricing... the better ones she was telling me were the more expensive ones.. like $110 bucks or something versus the $75 dollar ones...   Fck this...   I said nicely "thanks for your time but i'll look elsewhere" and I left. I walked 100 feet south to Super Target, found 4 choices all MUCH more affordable and I chose a $25 pair of Wahl clippers that include a 5-year warranty. Basically the same shit that was at Sally's for $75++  And I'm willing to bet if I had any issues I could return / exchange it with no problems.  I know this place is good for hair products and stuff but I'll be damned if I ever go there for clippers or anything ever again or recommend my guy friends that buzz their heads either. Having this lady work the desk is not doing this business ANY good.

I miss this place... I used to ride my bike to this Deli quite often when I lived near downtown Chandler before I moved away.  Now I work near downtown Chandler and now I get the opportunity to return and I must say the quality of food is still there and very good.  There's a wide range of deli-type sandwiches always hand made and a choice of hot and cold stuff... salads and deserts too.  Just about every time I go in there Chandler PD is in there picking up food or eating in.... If the local cops eat there - you know it's good :)  Ray (owner) seems very involved in local news too and is a great guy to talk to when you're there.  Enjoy

Stopped by one night late, only one guy working, probably the manager/owner based on him being on the phone and looking like he wanted to gtfo dodge attitude and not wearing anything quiznos related like most workers do...   Food... subpar... it's a chain... it's hard to fuck up... but he did. There was no care in the making of the sub... I pretty much watched him throw it together, run it through the toaster tossed some lettuce on and wrap it up...  I had chips in my hand... wanted a meal... he didn't ask and just rang it up w/o the drink... I asked what size cup to grab and he said "oh you wanted a drink?"  Of course I wanted a fucking drink... I just stared at him like wtf man?  Told him to keep his drink cause he'd have to re run my card...    srsly it's a chain that gives you all the stuff and training to make a sandwich like the other 1000's of quiznos around the country... and you can't do it. If you hate customer service don't buy a franchise sandwich shop.  Two stars... lucky it isn't one. I'm out

Other than some sticker shock I was pretty happy with the quick service and 3 minute lock pick job.  There was no friendly customer service tho... which between that and the sticker shock drove the 3-rating... If the guy was more friendly it could have EASILY been a 4. EDIT: 2 star... I'm still bitter about the big cost...  I know I got hustled... :/  So, I locked myself out of my bedroom.  I was in a rush and wasn't thinking... I have a lock on my bedroom door because I rent the house and have a roommate with kids over here 50% of the time... nuff said.  I originally bought a good lock for the room but on further thought (and being told flat out by the tech), a cheaper door lock will do the same thing as the nicer lock.  All a lock does is keep honest people honest anyways...  SO... because I had a 5-pin lock it cost more than a typical 3-pin interior door lock... ugh - but it took the guy the same amount of time?  Here's how it goes down: - Called... guy said ETA 30min with $35 trip charge and the tech would price it on-site (called a few places and they all said the same thing so) - his tech called to verify address... showed up on time - walked in with a typical toolbox.. recognized it immediately as a 5-pin lock and said $120 - OUCH!!!... - I signed the invoice (which had "RCA Locksmith" on the invoice instead of 24-7 Complete but... okay).  - Guy grabs a tensioner and a pick... shakes it around a bit... grabs another pick... shakes it around a bit... BAM... lock compromised and door opens. - Tells me I shouldn't have bought the better lock... (yeah i get it now) - Tells me to keep a backup key hidden somewhere (yup, check) - Writes invoice, adds tax... $167 bux... CASH ONLY...  - Says can follow me to ATM... okay... so he follows me to atm and do the money deal, get receipt and done  Moral of the story...  1. dont lock your fucking keys in your room... or car etc 2. keep a backup well hidden (problem is what people think is hidden isn't) 3. become a locksmith... because that's basically $2000/hour  and I could totally do that as a sidejob... I almost had it picked with a bobby pin and a clothespin as a tensioner...  In the long run... I feel like an idiot because I locked myself out, which I never do but F... It's still (slightly) cheaper than kicking the door in... replacing the door and trim and lock and all the maintenance of sanding, shimming, painting etc... time = money

Great super fresh food and feels very hometown-ish... that's good. The food rocks and there's ample indoor and outdoor seating.  Food Network's "Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives" with host Guy Fieri filmed a segment there which probably helped with some popularity but their food is great so it's no wonder they're already famous.  See you there.

Oh yeah.. best little mexican place in these parts.  Breakfast burrito's ROCK!!  Very friendly staff, seems like family owned because I always see the same two ladies working.    Their salsa is so good too, and you get a little salsa bar to play in too.  And they've got the best horchata I've ever tasted, but I'm a white guy so why listen to me... go try it yourself :)  Hard to see also but they have a back patio that could be good for small to medium sized groups.  Fail comes in when I want food on Sunday... no dice, closed on sundays...

I see Papago as a starter location for trail runners and bikers alike.  There's no hard hillclimbs/grades that will challenge a seasoned mtn biker or trail runner but there's plenty of good speed trails to hit cardio and do a nice tour of the park.   There's a tunnel under the road so you can go from north to south side of curry I think it is...  I've yet to be over to the zoo but I know that's over there and as far as I know you can get a fairly good (free) shot of the zoo from there.  There's some good hiking stuff you can do and climb up into some cool caves/holes in the rocks.  I've been to an enduro mtn bike ride there on the east side and that's a good track for that, short but make lots of laps and you'll be tired after 4 or 5 of those fo sho.  Good park, clean, trails are nice - look out for bees tho sometimes!  They've marked off some trails for that before but nothing new - you are in arizona.

Every time you walk in or hit the drive through you get "It's a great day for Chick-Fil-A, how can I help you?".  I feel welcomed :)  The other cool random thing... if I go through the drive through with my dog, they always ask if they can give her a milkbone... so she's a fan! just sayin.  As far as the food... I love this place - I mean I am the Duke on the iphone app... there all the time it seems.  Chicken is clean and not fatty, always juicy and the breading is never too thick. Extra pickles is never an issue and getting American cheese on it is cool too. Normal or Spicy Chicken is my pick.  My only beef w/ Chick-Fil-A is they're not open on Sundays... mormon thing. But whatcha gonna do?

Weekly lunch spot - consistently great food, good specials, good beer and friendly staff.  The lunch specials are the key to success - as they tend to test out new stuff for future menu revisions. All of their food is good - really never had anything bad there. Lots of seating and patio seating is great when it's manageable outside. It's always a happening spot in Chandler so best to find your way in there and experience it yourself.

slow, not enough staff for the tables, no real food it's all pre-packaged salads and sandwiches, handful of small 32" Tv's and only one big screen. channels kept changing on football Sunday and they couldn't get Red Zone channel to work at all. it's like the worst sports bar ever. Only have two stars cause the lady was overwhelmed and still nice and it's the only place with sports in this terminal.

Eh... the food was good but not something I'd crave?  I had a chicken/swiss panini that evidently came with corn on it?  EDIT: (actually it was the Adobe Panini: "Mesquite turkey, fresh mozzarella, green peppers, corn relish and chipotle mayo".  I got called out that there wasn't anything on the menu I said I ate, got it a little wrong but the review remains the same regardless. Here you go Bob M.)  Slightly surprised on it but, can't complain... it was good but nothing great.  They have subs and soups too - I'd go there again if friends were already going but def not somewhere I'd really mention when trying to think of somewhere to eat.

Consistently a great place to drink in that part of downtown Phx and their food is always excellent. I've tried a lot of their menu and haven't ever had an issue or complaint. Service is always solid even when packed full. Overall a winner w/o a doubt.

The food is simply the best around for Hawaiian food in the valley.  The atmosphere is great and Jay the owner is one of the nicest guys I've ever come across. He's always there to greet you and make sure everything came out ok and that you like your food.  Prices are average but you get a lot of food - you're not walking out of there hungry!

I heard of this place from my buddies on Chandler PD as they go there often and told me to try it.  It's a cool theme in there, one I can relate to growing up in and around the firehouse with my dad.  Lots of firetrucks, hoses, and pictures around of firemen.  Lots of hotsauces when you walk in the door - that's nice. Good subs and hoagies and affordably priced - I got a great hot sub for less than what I typically pay for at Subway. And after going to their web site and learning that they have a Foundation where they give money and tools back to First Responders... I'm definitely returning and telling everybody I know about it. And for the record, all the guys and kids working there were really nice.

So stoked to find such a great gyro place in Chandler. can tell the guy's from Chicago too... I haven't tried the italian beef but I will. I'm just sticking to the gyro's and plates for now.  I've now been there at least 20 times... and still loving it.   I am sorry to see such a horrible web site.. sad. but... that's not at all what to expect with their food.

Very happy I chose Camelback Moving.  Very nice on the phone and good communication and informative emails with lots of instruction and they put their prices online and explain how the insurance stuff works very well. The guys brought the clothing boxes in first so I could load all my hanging stuff and with a little explanation of what was going they worked hard and fast. They were very considerate of moving my large flat-panel tv into my own truck with their padding as they explained it's an easier ride than their truck. Everything moved into the new condo (chandler to tempe move) and no issues with the 3-story new place I have - told them what floor things went on and good to go.  Everything was great and everybody was very friendly.  I have already recommended them to a few friends and will continue to do so. And I'll use them again when I need that. :)

I've never finished my review for this place... and yet I'm here almost once a week for over a year now. lol. Sorry David!!  The food is consistently stellar and I've had nearly everything on the menu and a few special items off-menu as well. The staff is very friendly and always attentive.   Great for lunch and a good date spot in the evenings too. Quality drinks as it has mostly a full bar and just overall a wonderful restaurant.

Fantastic breakfast and/or brunch spot.   Honestly never had lunch there but I've had breakfast there numerous times at about lunch time. :) BEST THING about this... after a long hike or mtn bike ride... they have a whole protein section of the menu on the back that is perfect for after workouts.  They're almost always busy, sometimes wait can get up to 20-30 min during rush times but they serve fast but don't rush.  The place is great... just go... you'll agree :)

I'm a big fan of Murphy's Law, I like this place it has a good feel - it's comfortable.  Currently at 5 visits for lunch only and each time I've tried a different menu item, and 5 times have I been extremely happy with the food.   I think the corned beef and cabbage sliders are my fav tho especially with the sweet bbq type sauce on top... hard choice but I love those things.  The sweet potato fries are awesome and now my only choice of sides.  The Cloudy Day sandwich is great and the Au Jus is killer.  The beef is good and no fat anywhere on it.   The Beef Stroganoff was like mom used to make it.  The inside of the place has cool deco on all walls and ceiling and lots of dollar bills stapled up too.  Lots of flatpanel tv's around showing sports and funny pics from the web that helps keep any conversation funny.  The place is like a long thin corridor - I haven't been there at night but I would assume with a lot of people it'd be interesting walking through that to the back where the bathrooms are.  The waitresses are always nice and the manager / owner seems to walk around a lot and make sure everything is good and jokes around too... nice guy.  There's already been comments about parking in previous reviews... and I agree - not entirely their fault but there's a big gravel lot a 1/2 block away that has ample parking. It's not really that big of a deal.  Last thought:  Look up Murphy's Law address on Google maps and hit Satellite view and zoom into the building... ;)  Enjoy

hate having to do this but there has been a lot of changes at Murphy's in the last year, none of which I can report as being good. This place used to be consistently great with service and food but I'm sad to say it's not anymore.   Began earlier this summer when the food started being hit or miss. Some days it was the stellar food we all came in to have at lunch and other days... not so good. To the point that the last three times were bad and the large group of us haven't gone back and probably won't. The food thing came down to if a certain chef was working - if he was there, good; if not, bad. Started asking the waitresses and figured out the trend.   Fast forward to today and that chef has left and no longer works there. Which leads me to understand why the last 3 times in a row the food has been subpar. Like what makes a tomato hard? wasn't green or unripe but hard like... tough to cut hard. wtf? I don't know enough to know this is a reason the food has got worse but typically if you're looking to franchise you get different food vendors that can deliver the same type of food to your locations all across the country. So think frozen foods instead of more fresh stuff etc. I mean it makes sense. Also when you have a trained Chef quit whom made great food, and tailored to groups that wanted more expensive off the menu lunches and catered for local businesses & events... something's up. I can only assume it was the quality in food and the new direction...   ... meaning... I also found out (chandler news and biz journal) that Murphy's is wanting to franchising and changing their name to Irish Republic and some of what's going on inside. Girls with slightly different garb... kilt's and knee-high's. etc. Not so much breastaraunt-ish but similar.  Trademark Info: http://www.trademarkia.com/irish-republic-public-house-85274024.html  Service... much like the food the service has gone down in quality. There never seems to be enough girls during what used to be the lunch rushes and an hour lunch quickly turns into 1:30 lunches waiting on fill-ups and food and the check. It's not horrible service, girls are nice and friendly, just slow.   In summary: We haven't returned in at least 4 weeks and it's just not an option when thinking of places to eat downtown Chandler anymore. From 5 to a 2 (meh i've experienced better).  I miss what Murphy's was - we all do.

Don't expect to be in and out quickly... takes a bit to cook the pie but it's pretty good. Sat at the bar to eat with the girl because it was too busy to wait for a table so maybe our service was different but the girl was very nice and on top of things.  Being a Chicago kid... the pizza was good, better than most in Az but not better all.  Forgot what the cost was but wasn't that cheap.

The only reason I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 was because the server lady was really nice and apologetic... for what?  oooh for spilling a big glass of coke call over me... yeah it was awesome.  Suuure it could happen to anybody but I eat out at least once a day like every single day for years now and it's never happened... ever.  But anyways...  So dive bar == YES, by far.  It felt very, Wisconsiny or old town midwest.  I was by far the youngest person in there at midday by like 15 years at least and got some strange looks?  Never seen a streetbike before?    Anyways stopped there with a buddy because I randomly saw that they had a Friday FISH FRY, which I'm waaay down for and haven't seen one really since moving to Az.  Stopped in to try it.... wasn't all-you-can eat for one.... two it was pretty bad fish... like not good at all... breading was more like a pebbled sorta thing instead of like battered or whatever? (so not a cook btw)  It wasn't good.  And last but certainly not least, three was the price was like 18 BUCKS!!  whaat?  come on!  Needless to say I haven't been back and I highly doubt I will be.   But thanks nice lady for getting sticky coke on me that was cold as f*ck on the ride home... :/

I'm a sucker for Chicago food from back home but out here in the valley, and Higley Hot Dog has been there for a while providing authentic Vienna Beef Hot Dogs since I went to ASU east campus.  Very home town feel, the older couple that owns/runs it are always very nice and happy and having a good time.  And the lunch line there gets long and out the door cause it's so good :)  Notes:  Not open on Sundays... and CASH only! The MAP on yelp is/was wrong... here's the correct business profile link on Google Maps - http://is.gd/fn6U   They have some good press already as well: http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/123004 http://www.insiderpages.com/b/3657327340

I went with Lamb and Mint...  I can't really explain or relate it to anything per say but it was gooooood.  The dipping sauce (gravy) it came with was really good. At first glance it didn't look like it'd fill me up but I was surprised... the meat and stuff is packed pretty dense so it works.  The bread is really tasty and crusty but not too dry.  The beers were like $6 a pop and for two of us it was $30 before tip...  I'll go back... was pretty good... lots of other pasties to try on the menu

Excellent take-out and ordering. Always fast and ready at the counter within 5-10 minutes, quick counter service and out the door :) I don't like eating in much; kids etc... So I order for pick up a lot. They're just very consistant and the food is always stellar and I continue to come back time and time again.  I want to tell a story about once I forgot my wallet at home and later when driving home from the office I wanted dinner.. called ahead ordered food.. got in and realized I didn't have my wallet. I felt like an idiot. In my stupor I assumed I had to drive home and return later to grab my cold food or re-order again. There was a manager sitting close by at the end of the counter and realized what I forgot. He asked if I've been there before and I said "yeah all the time actually", not like he was really concerned but he ended up telling me "don't worry about it" and to take the food w/o paying. I made sure he was serious and I thanked him a few times and went home.  I ate... got my wallet and drove back. He wasn't around (in back somewhere) but I told the girl what I ordered and she was a little shocked that I came back. Anyways... I paid and went back home. I know $14 or so for the meal wasn't a massive hit to the biz if I never came back... but  the point is he hooked a brother up in need. It's just a cool mentality to have as a manager / biz owner and I appreciated it and I won't ever forget it.  Thanks manager guy... you've got a customer for good.

I've been to other Old Chicago's and this one is much newer and cleaner inside, it used to be a Uno's back when I used to work over near there.  Probably why I had to add this location in Yelp.  The meatball Stromboli was pretty good, def not the best I've had but not the worst either.  Lots of sports on tv to keep us busy while waiting, which honestly wasn't that long but the manager came out to offer us free appetizer or dessert and apologized.  I'd go back :)   Happy Hours: Monday - Friday 4pm - 6pm and 10pm - Midnight

Threw out a tweet asking for a good plumber, got a buddy that mentioned he had used Alan's before.  I called him on a friday afternoon and he asked when I'd like the new hose bibb installed... I said now if you got time.. jokingly... and he said hold on I'll call you back in 5min.  4 min later he calls and says I got a guy (Mike) that will by in 30min after he finishes a job by your house, does that work for you?   Heck yes!  So Mike calls to verify location, shows up, super nice dude.  We talked the whole time he did the work about random stuff and he had the thing done in a jip and put a nice new on on with a thread so I can remove it in the future unlike the crappy old leaky one that was sweated on.  So on a friday evening at 4:45pm they got a guy out to me quick and had the job done within about an hour and a half of my first ever calling them.  That's a win in my book folks.  I'll call them again when I need a plumber.

Buddy said "lunch" and "hotdogs" and I was like oh yeah... He heard of this little place in an antique mall?   Okay I'm down for new things....   It's seriously in an antique store... like old furniture and stuff...  He's got his own little section in and to the left with a heavily decorated front wall showing Pittsburgh Steelers and Penguins stuff all over the place...   The guy was super friendly and nice, very welcoming and cool to talk to... even talked to him about how he ended up in an antique shop...    FYI:  CASH ONLY!  I dislike cash only places but the little shops I don't mind so much.  My choice was the Blitzburgh - he only makes it on Wed Sat & Sunday's so heads up there.  It's 6 potato & cheese filled pierogies smothered in butter and onions, then topped with sauerkraut, homemade chili, cheddar cheese, & a mild or spicy Kielbasa.   HEEELLLL YEEEAAAHHH!  So much food... soo good...  I've never really had that kind of food before... so into it   So I'll be back... I'm spreading the word... he's got some hot dogs for like $3 so I may try a couple of those next time in...

It's not just that the food is awesome... it's the fact that I feel good eating it - he's a nice guy who loves making this food and I enjoy spending my money here.  nuff said  I was at a wine tasting thing with the girl... and the only thing that made me not hate that whole place was the fact that I found a few beers, but most of all that Pittsburgh Willy had his cart there cookin some MEAT...   All beef Chili dog... x2... all I'm sayin.   This guys food is soo good - and again I got to talk to him a little bit and another guy (his dad maybe??) and the inviting smile and open conversation with him just made me love his food and his place that much more.

Had a lunch meeting here today and first thought was that it was a sports bar and wasn't expecting much.  To be brief... I had a Bacon burger with Cheddar... fav...  The bacon was thick GOOD bacon not the cheapy greasy crap.  The burger was so well prepared I was shocked to be honest... very well cooked and seasoned and more of a gourmet burger I'd say but very very good.  I had the broccoli salad, which was broccoli, cheese, peas, and those sweet raisins or craisins all clumped together with like a mayonase or sourcream sauce or something... REALLY good tho... to the point where I want to ask them how to make it so I can tell the girlfriend... sooo good.  Service was good though there were two other tables other than us and one girl so they weren't busy.  She was very nice and prompt with refills and order perfect the first time... Good place for a lunch meeting - if I'm ever up there again I'd definitely return.

The girl got me into this stuff... and I can say that I do like it better than ice cream. The fruit toppings are a bonus - pretty much always get strawberries on my stuff.  The cake batter and red velvet are my two choices and snowcaps, heath crunches, some fruit, and i'm good to go.   If you check in on Yelp while you're there you get a buck off your order... tis a good deal.   There are about.... 12 or more flavors of froyo, and a whole self-serve bar of stuff to put on your creation. Every single time i've been in there the employees are cleaning... and it seems pretty damn spotless already but that stuff would get sticky and the stuff in the bar can get out of control but it's always organized and clean... last thing I want is some frickin gummy icky candy thing in my snowcaps... just sayin.  Overall... it's trendy, the girl likes it and now so do I... so win win.  I've been there a handful of times and I'm sure we'll be returning again... and again...

On short notice once moved into a new house, I called Bryan and he was able to come over and install a few ceiling fans and some new switches to control them and the lights.  Even though some modification had to be done to the wall for the bigger switch he didn't leave a mess.  Laid down some drop cloths and cleaned up before he left...   My rooms are cooler now and I'm happy about that... nice guy too!

Couple of harsh reviews but I've been nothing but happy with Jersey Mike's.  I've never seen or heard of other locations but this one opened down the road and after trying it out, I've returned about 15 times now and will continue to do so.  It's NOT like subway at all actually...  I have always had great sandwiches from here and have always had a lot of meat stuffed in, to the point to where a big sandwich basically makes 2 meals for me.  The stuff is always fresh and tastes super good so, no problems there.  I will give a word to the wise tho... Although it's very good... "Mikes Way" has them put a bunch of oil & vinegar on and if you plan on keeping half for dinner or next day be careful w/ mikes way as it'll saturate the bread over time.  Mikes Way eaten right away is the bomb tho... loves it.  Just heads up.  I will say they do take some time to make the food, and lunch time can get pretty busy and lengthy so they'll want to work on that.  But they slice the meat for every sandwich and it seems that may be part of the backup.  I've gone in there at night to pickup food on the way home and it didn't seem to take as long.  Pricey?  Eh... I'm not saying that... I think they're very competitive and I've never thought that the times I've been there.  Not as much as Capriotti's but not as cheap as Subway... but subway sucks so lol...   Good small patio for nice days to eat outside... good amount of inside seating but again gets busy at lunch (cause it's good) and the one downside is they only have Pepsi products.... fail... I like Coke :/

I hate going to the dentist... start there.   Walking in, very nice open lobby, water features, nice chairs & happy smiley face girl when I walked in...   I filled out my paperwork already as I downloaded it from their site (convenient) prior to my appointment.  Pretty easy to fill out.  They're a paperless office and can email you your x-rays and everything through the power of 'electronic mail'... it's crazy :)   But srsly... that's helpful as most dental offices are stuck in the late 18th century.  Being a web geek this makes me happy.  Got x-rays done - never been in a machine like that but put your chin on this little platform and the dealio spins around your head and makes pretty x-ray vision pictures.  Lady doing the cleaning was really nice, felt very comfortable and relaxed... no sharp deadly objects or loud scary noises to freak me out....  I asked a bunch of questions (normally do) and she was very detailed and explained everything to answer my questions.    Doctor Goat came in - nice guy, not arrogant.  Put in the time to chit chat a bit after the exam and wasn't pushy or salesy... Gave me some options for other services but no obligation or anything - just informative.  If you're in the area and need some clean chompers - Dr. Goat seems to be the guy to talk to - or at least smile at.

Very good food, great lunch menu and affordable all in one.  Had a meetup here with four other guys for lunch today and two of them eat here constantly and kept raving of it.  Nothing short of wonderful here but nothing extremely out of the ordinary from a Chinese restaurant to bump it to a five.  Service was excellent and timely, place was very clean, located far south east but I hear there's actually people that live out there these days so that's cool.  Lunch menu was pretty large - lots of choices and everybody mentioned that theirs was exceptional food as well.  You get the typical egg drop or hot-n-sour soup prior to the main dish coming out.  Food comes out pretty quick (crackin the whip back there).  Price was pretty cheap - good deal :)  Not sure I'll travel that far south just to eat there but if I'm around that area or need to have lunch meeting with the S.E. SEO boys again - it'll be in my mind to return and try some more good food :)

Kudos for having the coolest staff ever.  I don't recall ever reviewing a fast food place, in fact now that I try to edit the category on yelp for this place, I realize they don't even have a selection for fast-food.   So why review it?   I'm not going to mention the food so much, however it was good, as much as you could expect from a Taco Bell and Long John Silvers mashup - but who doesn't like some planks of white-fish along side a spicy chicken quesadilla?  I mean come on!  What I am reviewing is the STAFF... I've been through the drive-through a couple times and inside once... Until today I always was like.. many they're kinda friendly there.   Today was no different but I figured after 3 or so times I had to say something.  The people that work there, at least on the speakers and at the counter are really frickin happy and they're really nice and fun.  I don't ask for much when I go get fast-food but the "Happy Guy" as Julie M (only review before me here) makes the experience there fun.  You don't get that much anymore.  So to that kid and the other girl in the speaker box thingy... Thanks - and keep having fun and enjoying your job - I'm glad somebody does these days :)

I've been to this Dick's location a bunch of times and I've got to say that I've gotten more help from the employees in this one that I've ever gotten from any other location.  I've spent some major time with the guys in the gun dept and they're always more that helpful regardless of how busy and how many people they have waiting for them.  Major props to those guys for good knowledge and patience.  Another time I was there I wanted some new shorts for softball and they didn't have and L's left but jokingly I checked the Under Armour manikin as he was wearing the same shorts, and what do ya know... L.  It was near closing time and the associates were getting their stuff done so they could go home (I've worked retail and I know at closing time you just want everybody to bail so you can clean and go home).  I asked a girl around the corner I was able to rob the manikin of his clothes and she laughed and had no problem taking him apart and yankin the shorts right off!  I was so happy as I had a game the next day and didn't want to be running around looking for these shorts.  Think I'm joking? lol - http://www.flickr.com/photos/ryno/4113416766/  Anyways - good store, always clean and everybody seems very nice and knowledgable in their area.  Never had an issue there.

Best place at the mall to watch sports and great place to relax/drink if the girl is inside shopping and spending money :)  Not sure how long this location has been here because I think I remember it being something else, but then again I'm not one to frequent malls too often.   First off... LOVE the fried mushrooms and fried pickles... honestly can't really find those anywhere else around - not that i've seen.  Wings are always good though I do have a issue with the amount of hard breading that's on the boneless chicken wings... always seems excessive.   Salsa seems to change temperature, the girl says sometimes it's too hot for her, but mostly is the same. Different cooks perhaps?   Celery costs extra = lame... it's frickin celery... Anyways, at least they don't charge for refills lol... (yet). But overall pricing is fair and normal.  This location is very clean, again which leads me to believe it's newer? Seems to be great TV viewing, more-so in the bar area than the table area however - so be mindful of that. Service was quick and very friendly. Outside patio along the walkway near chipotle in the mall is good for people watching too, however you have to deal with no TV's and smokers :/

Best Wells Fargo I've been in and by far the most helpful bankers out of the valley WF's I've been in.    Paulette has gone above and beyond to help me with my personal accounts and setup another LLC for me and later on a DBA and fix those typical WF surprise fees that I'm not supposed to get but always seem to pop up.  Other that that, it's a typical bank but located in a good place and quick and easy to get in and out.    Thanks Paulette

Screaming obese kids everywhere sticking their fat sausage fingers in every bin touching everything...   At least that was the day I was there.. though I doubt it differs many days.  LOTS of candy and sugar stuff... some stuff I haven't seen since I was a kid, some stuff I've never seen at all.    Gave it 4 not because "yay I'm a fan" but because it delivers what people want in a candy store - even though I'm not a big candy / sweets guy.   I'm sure this place will do well near Halloween

Good for young kids, not good for aquarium aficionados or people who like oceanariums, lots of fish, big viewing areas and quiet museum-like experiences.  Perhaps I'm spoiled growing up in the north burbs of Chicago and having a pass to the Shedd Aquarium my whole life, and seeing some of the best aquariums across the country but... SEAlife didn't do anything for me.  I can sort of deal with the price, it's expensive to set this type of thing up and get the fish in and blah blah... I get it.  It's pricey for the experience but I get it - so nothing in my review is based on the price.  A few of the tanks only had a couple fish in them, so I'm assuming they're still populating them. and some of the areas like the circle room with the fish going around the room and above the doors had half the room's windows masked off... unfinished? idk.  The starfish thing was roped off when we went but there was a staff person there talking to kids about them. There was a little movie theatre area showing shark videos... aka discovery channel.  That opened up into the room with a somewhat small viewport considering no more than 10 people can look through it at a time without blocking it from behind. Dinosaurs hanging from the ceiling... okay?  That big viewport looks into the main center tank area, with a shipwreck type of thing... lots of bigger fish and sharks swimming around.    Which eventually leads to 'The Tunnel'...  One side looks into the middle of that big tank and the other side is short with a nearby rock wall; not many fish on that side.  The floor was clear but, even in the short time the Aquarium has been open, was scuffed so bad it was pretty much not-see-through.  They'll have to figure that out.    One little black light tank with jellyfish... couple of those bubble things you can crawl under and stick your head up into the middle of the tank for a photo op... couple skinny semi-circle shaped tanks... one little sea horse viewport... little lcd panels with info on them for the display...  Felt some areas were bare.... lots of open room w/ nothing to see, most places except the main Ray tank with the overlook balcony. Note, not a petting tank, it's about 5' tall or so but clear all around and lots of rays swimming around and some sharks from what I remember.  The walls are colorful and lots of lighting effects going on around every room - nice walls I thought.  Being in Arizona, of course everything has to be bilingual with spanish... and in one case (the active display on the floor that you interact with) the whole thing was in spanish with no way that I could tell to flip it to english to figure out what the game / point was of the display. FAIL, wtf? Useless.  After that you're dumped into the gift store... honestly I didn't even take the time to look at anything... more screaming kids and strollers blocking routes and I was ready to get outta dodge as fast as I could.  After the store is a kids play area - something with the big plastic tubes and stuff like you see at burger kings.  AAHHH get me out of here! Reminded me of a playground or school recess area.  So, needless to say I went in expecting more and left feeling shorted and unimpressed. Won't be back.

We need a good indoor range out in the east valley - I'll update the review when they open but this is much desired. Can't wait! :)

Nice brand new 10-lane range, in a great location on the far east side of the valley.  Like I said, new... everything is new.  I was disappointed however it is only 10 lanes as the building is much larger and during construction was deceiving as I thought the whole building was going to be the range, but as it turns out it's only about a 1/4 of the building.  The store front is average size, but not nearly as big as some of the bigger popular ranges/clubs out here in 'zona.  Seem to have a lot of pistols but very light on any rifles.  Range rules.... fairly standard stuff here...  They DO NOT ALLOW .308 rifles and if you're not a member, you cannot fire a shotgun - which really sucks, but she (one of the owners) explained to me the reasoning behind that rule as a non-member fired unauthorized bird shot after being advised not to and it damaged the lanes.  So because of one guy.... you know...  But 5.56 and 7.62 is okay.  Oh and no double-tapping... that's standard stuff tho.  Ammo there seems fairly priced for a range so that's good.  They have targets but you CAN bring in your own, which is nice but the kicker there is it can't be any of the gimmick targets, like osama or whatever.   I've never understood why, but other ranges do that too - perhaps it's a legal thing? idk.  Range is pretty well lit, but I had trouble knowing how far my target was at, unless I missed some markings.   So all my shots and dialing in a newly built AR was fun were at an undefined distance.  Visually I have an idea of the measurements but I'd like some lane markings or have the control box stop at given intervals.  The owners were very accommodating and friendly as we started a new 'gun club' of sorts at a tech/geek coworking space.  We had some experience people and some absolute beginners there and they worked well with us on cost and getting the noobs outfitted with ears/eyes and making sure they felt safe and secure.  It's good to have a range out this far east - I just hope it doesn't get TOO busy that it's hard to get a lane.  But I hope they get busy enough to make money and stay open, and possibly expand.  Go check them out!

Simple and quaint little shop around the corner from the main downtown chandler strip.  They make Paletas (popsicles) with real fruit and have a pretty interesting variety of flavors that seems to change quite often.  The stuff is cheap, couple bucks each but oh so good.    Went with a group from Gangplank on one of our "let's go check out another small biz downtown" tours and I can say that I'm stoked to go back and try the other flavors.  Had the raspberry one and it was good... real good.  I'll be back.

I've parked here twice now for over a week each and I love the speed and ease of being here. The location is great, it doesn't feel as ghetto/sketchy as some of the others nearby Sky Harbor and the vans are clean and the drivers are very friendly. I always get covered parking... it seems like most of their stuff is covered. And their site is actually nice and easy to use too... All around win.  I'm pretty much parking here all the time... no doubt. You should too.

Another review I forgot to finish... Brad had a lot a lot of attention to detail and did a super job on the windows and screens and the exterior window trim... as in they looked new and they're at least 5+ years old. Definitely something we put off for far too long.   Just to note... Brads a really nice guy and was very personable and the cool thing that he did.... he took in my recycling bin from the road and put it away for me... who does that? that's just awesome! again... attention to detail and nice guy just sums it all up.  I've sent a couple people his way already and they're happy as well. I have no problem recommending Brad or using his services again.

This place just opened and is located behind Gangplank (where I work a lot) and Yoli's brought in some breakfast samples for us to try out - good stuff btw!  A handful of us (12) decided to go over for lunch and check it out.  Location is somewhat hidden in the little market just west of Arizona Ave and north and between of Frye and Chicago St.  Nice little older house looking place, with a nice patio that's shaded and enclosed in the little market area.  Inside is all redone and very clean with new tables and chairs. They do take debit and have a soda machine for refills.  Food is very homemade American cafe/deli style with good burgers. Currently since they just opened they don't have menus other than large notecards with today's menu, which works well actually. Had about 10 different choices...   I went with the turkey bacon sandwich w/ American cheese on sourdough. Very good no complaints at all. It did take a little bit since we slammed them with 12 people right away on their first day but they held in and everything came out within a reasonable time and with no mistakes at all even with all the custom orders w/ the burgers we had. They use little baskets for the food and have metal silverware. OOOH and pickles... crisp too, not soggy and floppy :)  I had some time to talk to the two owners and they're very nice and personable and were more than happy we showed up even though we swamped them a bit. Very nice ladies and without a doubt I and the rest of us at Gangplank will return frequently.  I say get down here and try it out.

The Geno's Famous Cheesesteak was excellent.  I'm starting the review off with a 4-star (yay i'm a fan) but not because anything was wrong... I've only been in there once and have yet to try everything nor have I tried the delicatessen side of the board. If it's as good as the cheesesteak was though... it'll easily be a 5.  So the Geno's Famous. I didn't get any custom stuff, just the way Geno's wants it. It was excellent. The bread was very good too, very soft and even the corners were baked right and not hard like others I've had in az. They don't use whiz, which technically could be an issue for some but I'm not getting into that argument because I'm not from philly and I don't care. Some cheesesteak places pride themselves on it, others have their own mix - it's all good to me because I get to eat it all :)   The onions were cooked very good, real soft and tasty but didn't take away from the meat. Speaking of, the meat was very good, like a distinct taste I can't really put my head around just yet - I need another one to pin it down. But it was very good meat.  So with all that said... the sandwich rocked - I'll easily be back for sure.  Venue... very clean in and out, very visible location from Williams Field road north side. The girl actually spotted it the other night when we hit up the froyo place across the way. Walked in right up to the counter. Service was fast and cordial.  Upon taking a picture (for yelp of course) a guy started talking to me, whom seemed to be the owner perhaps? Nice guy, asked what we ordered and suggested I tried some of their sauce... he made sure we got that added on the side before we left.. Not sure if he's Geno, but nice fella.  Forgot to mention the fries...  Fries either suck hard or their just good. These fries were just good and pushing damn tasty... I dont know if it's the oil they use or some special seasoning (didn't seem salty at all tho) but they were good. It's on rare occasion that I finish a basket of fries.  Overall I suggest you check it out. I'm sure that was the best cheesesteak I've had in Arizona so I can't wait to return and try another variant and see what they have to offer behind the deli because there needs to be some good lunch places out here in Gilbert... Geno's is off to a great start.  See you in there.

I finally found a small business plumber that's worth a damn.  I was referred to Roger via my twitter request for help by a good friend who's a business owner that I trust in Tempe, the owner of Monti's. I asked online... nay... begged to find a GOOD plumber and not a corporation that just sends out a drone van from somewhere in my area. I wanted a small biz guy that's working hard to build his own business and could be the 'guy to call' or recommend to people. I like having a quality network - if you know me... you'd understand.  SO... Roger. Very friendly guy, cool to talk to and setup an appointment at my house the next day after calling him. He was prompt - actually beat me to my house :/ My bad.   I explained the drainage issues in the house since we've moved in, we've done stuff to fix the problems but they always were a temporary solution. He steps in and does his thing... 30min he does both bathrooms, sinks and tubs... bam! Everything drains like SUPER fast... It's never been that nice ever... in 3yrs. :O  Also, I ask a lot of questions because I'm genuinely interested in pretty much everything. He was cool and explained why our drains have the problems they have because of the lack of a breather hole that most sinks have... And honestly until now I didn't really think about that.  So moral of the story - Roger is a cool dude and knows his shit. He's a local guy and not a big corporation; runs his own biz and does quality work for a more than affordable rate. I asked and he does all plumbing stuff not just drains.   I highly recommend him and I will call upon his service again when and if it's needed. Call him! Tell him Chuck (and yelp) sent ya :)

Green Chili Pulled Pork sandwich was great, Smoked Tomato Bisque was amazing.  After Siracha closed we Gangplankers have been waiting for something to open up in that space for a while. Now we have Vintage 95.   Decor is really nice... very wine bar-ish. Thick wood tables and chairs and textiles all around and dimly lit old historical looking pendants hanging above the bar. Place feels comfy. Outdoor patio still exists w/ fire pit and umbrellas for the day time. They're working on a side patio too but that's still a ways off from opening as per construction.  Staff was very friendly and all smiles - service was attentive and accurate. Manager/owner came over to see how the food was about mid lunch.  Food... we were in for lunch and 3 of us got the pulled pork with green chili's as mentioned at the beginning and a cup of the smoked tomato bisque w/ what tasted like breaded grilled cheese in it... I'd eat that stuff all day every day if I could.  Pulled pork sandwich tasted really good, bread got a little heavy half way through for me but I ate out the meat and chilis to finish it off. One friend is a vegetarian and got a veggie panini and commented on how good it was and also loved the tomato soup. Another friend had the vintage flatbread, and didn't enjoy it. Was overwhelmed with the pickled onions and candied dates that made it too sweet to eat all of it.  Drink... only went there for lunch so I can't comment on that yet.  Dessert... we didn't order anything but looked at the offerings. We were kind wondering why there was no chocolate on there seeing as we were in a wine bar... there was one with Nutella sauce??? that's kind of not really what we expected but... anyways heads up.  We'll all be back to try other things... and to see what they have for happy hour too. Cheers

Finally open! Subs here so far are Excellent. There are a lot of options on the menu and bread is fresh made with that big mixer in the back. They redecorated the whole place and rebuilt all the counter and table areas. I've been hearing rave reviews from people that have eaten there in other locations and I can confirm, at least with my first sub and the other 30 or so people here at Gangplank that have eaten there already, that Planet Sub subs are in fact... damn good. Think the best of when quiznos was actually good and when subway used to be the shit... it's like that but in one place. :)  They say breakfast is coming soon too. WIN. Go there... enjoy... say hi and come over to Gangplank and work and eat :)

Very happy with the work done here on my GSXR600.   Brought her in looking for a good mechanic as I needed some basic maintenance and front fork seals. I had spoken to Preston, the owner, on the phone previous just to check pricing, which I considered to be very fair in comparison to others around town. Brought the bike in first thing in the morning with a list of to-do's and they had it ready before the end of business.  I got the fork seals done, readjusted back out, chain, oil, front and rear brakes bled and adjusted and idle screw fixed.  After picking up my bike I got to talking to the mechanic and turns out he raced and wrenched on AMA bikes for a loong time. So that and the fact that he was really excited to tell me about the tiny nuances of the repairs me made and the adjustments made and why and how to pay attention to those so I could adjust them myself if need be in the future... I could tell he loves working on bikes including mine. Made me feel good to have them taking care my my ride.  Overall great work done. Initially early on when the owner wasn't there communication was difficult with one of the shop guys and I wasn't sure they were actually going to call me back to discuss work but once I got in touch with the owner it was all good.   I'll definitely bring my bike back there for sure and I have already and will continue to recommend them to my friends and local riders as well.

It's Jimmy John's... every time I've been to this location they're fast, the orders are made correctly and it's clean. I have no issues here and continue to eat here. :)

Went to the official opener tonight; enjoyed the atmosphere and the food was excellent.  Look and feel is rustic, but clean, western cowboy theme with country music playing, a stage for live acts at night, flights of bourbons and whiskeys and plenty of beers. There's a small outdoor patio with a couple hi-tops with more hi-tops inside aside the bar and open-faced brick wall and a handful of regular tables near the back.  Local drafts are Four Peaks Kiltlifter, SanTan Devils Ale and the Lumberyard IPA. Prices were $5.25 for 16oz, $7.25 for 20oz. More local stuff in cans/bottles for $4.50 and local domestic bottles 3.75.  There was a list of wines for $6-$13 glass.  Beer cocktails were $8 with mixed cocktails ranging from $7-$10.  Whiskey flights ranged from $11-$16 Bourbon & Whiskey pours were $5.50-$9.50 NOTE: There were some instant complaints on the lack of quality in the selection from the Bourbon drinkers with me - basic mentions of typical store-bought varieties.  Had some food as well... The food was excellent! I had the chicken bacon brie club - it was badass. Few friends had the burgers and a few different appetizers which were great too.  Server girls were in respectable plaid button down shirts with jean shorts and either cowgirl boots or sneakers.  There were 3 flat panels about 42" at the bar and 2 more in far corners. Looks like they had satellite package with all the sports but I didn't get a chance to ask if they'd have the big games and UFC fights.  Free WiFi too! Seemed fast.  Overall I see great promise from Bourbon Jack's. I hope they can overcome the common slowness of lunch service that downtown Chandler has sadly become known for. Great new place to check out and the live music is going to be great for downtown Chandler. Good luck guys! See you soon.

Good fast lunch in downtown Chandler.  We went there a bunch when they first opened... new owners, new chefs, but same in-store management. The last place we never went to because it was so bad... At first they seemed to have really changed and cleaned things up...   We eat there once or twice a week getting food of the conveyor belt mostly... at lunch it rotates out fast and the service with drinks and checks is pretty fast. They're pretty attentive and come around often to see if things are okay and will order stuff up if it's not on the blet.. .like everybody takes the gyoza pretty fast but if you want some she'll get it made for you. And at $2/plate you can rip through 6-10 and be pretty full.  They do have a killer bento box lunch that's pretty big but FYI... they're slow to bring that out. If your friends are doing the belt they'll be almost done by the time you get your bento box out. it's good though and a LOT of food for $8.50.  Haven't been there for dinner... I'd rather go elsewhere for killer sushi but it's a great lunch place and we'll be back.

Came back to Tempe for the holidays and was surprised when a friend said to meet at Postino's in Tempe... when did they build that?  Was a cold night but plenty of heaters on the patio that kept it warm and comfortable. Service was very good and attentive and the food was what I expected having been to the other locations in the past. Very nice location btw... good scouting.  Nothing bad to say at all. Postino's does it again - but in a better location :)
