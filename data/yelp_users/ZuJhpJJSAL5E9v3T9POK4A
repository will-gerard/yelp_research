I'm not really a fan of this Air Port for one reason only. The TSA Agents. Seriously they were super rude to me! Before I tell you my story I'm going to review the rest of the air port.  The airport is super clean and well maintained. I feel like they update it alot because it doesn't look old like alot of the other air ports do. They also have many different places to eat in the air port that are not ridiculously expensive like every other air port. I've never had a problem flying in or out and all of my flights have been on time. My favorite thing about this airport is that you CANNOT get lost. The airport kind of just flows so you get where your supposed to be. One more cool thing about Sky Harbor is the ceiling when you go down into baggage claim. It's the coolest mosaic of colored glass. Its the one thing I remember about my childhood!!  Now you would think that with my review this air port would get a higher rating. Well because I like the air port so much I won't give it one star. I'll give it two. This is why.  I'm one of those people who has a really bad food allergy. So I have to travel everywhere with my epipen. Being the paranoid traveler I am, I called TSA and asked them what their policy was regarding an epipen. They told me that I could get it hand inspected and everything would be fine. So before I went on my trip I got a note from my doctor and had my prescription on it just in case I got hassled.   So when I left Hawaii everything was cool. They hand inspected it and I was through security within five minutes. It was super easy and not a big deal. When I went through Sky Harbor I had it out and separate from my bags and I calmed explained the situation to the TSA agent. He then proceeded to tell me that they could not hand inspected it and it had to go through the X-ray.  I then told them that it couldn't be X-rayed and it needed to be hand inspected. He then called 3 other TSA agents to surround me. While this was happening I kept being told it could not and WOULD not be hand inspected. And if I didn't let my EPIPEN get X-Rayed I would get strip searched and my bags would be hand searched for weapons and I would miss my plane.   I finally got tired of being bullied and harassed and let them X-ray my epipen. This whole situation took thirty minutes and by the time I was done dealing with the TSA agents I was scared and shaking. If I fly out of Arizona I will not be excited to fly out of here.

I'm not really a fan of Buffalo Exchange.   While I was in Tempe this awesome girl told me about this place and told me I could get gently used cowboy boots here. I'm always down for buying gently used shoes and clothes so I made my grandma and mom drive through enemy territory to the buffalo exchange.   I was looking forward to cheap clothes and cheap boots but I came here there were no boots being sold at all. I still looked through the shoes rack trying to find something that caught my eye but no luck. So I ended up looking through the clothes and I was actually shocked at the prices. This store did not have consignment store pricing. It was full price for used clothing. I wasn't really that happy with the selection of clothes either. Maybe it's because I'm used to shopping in Hawaii.  I did finally go look at the accessories and I was a bit disappointed with the selection. The one purse I wanted to buy had a hole in it and was scratched. So I ended up looking in the jewelry. It was decently priced and alot of it was super cute. I ended up picking up a couple of necklaces and a pair of sunglasses that I LOVE!!!!   My one beef that I had with this place is that they do not have bags to put your purchases in. They have made the decision that you do not get bags. You get a token that allows you to make a five cent donation to charity. I think it would be a cool concept but I couldn't find where to put my token which was a bit disappointing. This whole store was disappointing I guess.

I have come here every time I've gone to Arizona. So when my grandma recommended we go here for authentic Mexican food and margarita's I was super stoked.  Sadly this place blew it on every level. When we came in we were told it was a 5 minute wait. Instead we waited 15 minutes. I didn't really care because I was hungry. We were finally sat down and I realized it was so hot in the restaurant that I started sweating.  But I was so excited for the food that I looked past this.  Finally the waitress came. She recognized my grandma and remembered her order. And took it. So then it came my turn to order so I tried to order my food and drinks. The waitress literally told me that she would not take my food order. I was super confused because she took my alcohol order but wouldn't give me food. I ended up getting a jumbo margarita on the rocks. So when the drinks came out everyone else got their drinks except me. I told the manager he questioned my age and then tried to card me again. So I ended up getting carded twice for a drink that took me 15 minutes to get!  While we were waiting for our drinks and food I realized it literally took 30 minutes for them to clear a table. I don't know if they were short staffed or just did not care but the restaurant was messy and the staff was super rude.  By this time I was starving, sweaty, and drunk before she even decided to take my order. This waitress what the rudest person I have ever met! I ended up ordering the enchiladas del mas. Which was a seafood enchilada. In the past they were amazing. But this time it took 30 minutes to get my food. The tortillas were stale and tasted like cardboard. The fish and seafood were rubbery and the only thing that was good was the refried beans and rice. Seriously though, how hard is refried beans and rice. You can't mess that up!!!   By the end of the night I was drunk, sweaty and hungry. his was possibly the worst service I have ever gotten in my life. I have never gotten disrespected so much in a place I was a patron.  If my family hadn't gotten good service here and good food and drinks I would have complained to the manager. But since I was the only one who had an inedible meal I just left. You could not pay me to come back here. And I'm making it a point to tell the people of yelp about the horrible service I received here. DO NOT COME HERE.

I really did not like this place. They were very rude to me and tried to get me to buy a pair of corral boots even though I specifically told them why I did not want corrals. What made me mad was that I looked on their website at a pair of boots that I wanted to buy. And they didn't have it at the store. They didn't have the style and brand I wanted.   I ended up having to talk to two different people before they even went to the computer to see if they even had the boot in stores in Arizona. They didn't.  I asked if they knew of anywhere that would have the boots and they told me some other places and they ended up not having it.  For being Boot Barn I was super disappointed because this store is super small and very hard to find. It's also not easy to get to. If you are looking for boots don't come here. Go to Shepler's in Mesa. They are so much nicer there and have a bigger selection!

I wish there were more of these places in Hawaii. The reason this place is awesome is because everything here is organic, natural and MSG free. Which is awesome for someone like me with an MSG allergy. The prices are not bad at all considering the fact that you are buying all natural and organic food.   The employees are super nice and the grocery store is always stocked. I would rather come here than Fryes or Safeway!!!!!

One place that I love coming to is this place. I know I can depend on this place for a good breakfast, lunch or dinner. I was flying out of Phoenix and I desperately needed food before I dealt with TSA, and flying. I ended up buying the power protein sandwich which was a very reasonable price. $5 in an airport for a good sandwich. I'm down!!  Anyways they took my order and it took about five minutes to make my sandwich. The power sandwich had whole grain bread,  egg whites, white Vermont cheddar and lean ham. The ham and egg tasted so good. And the bread was very hearty and delicious. It made eating healthy be delicious. I really enjoyed my sandwich and it kept me full until lunch time!!

I really enjoy this place!  I really missed these little homegrown cafe's that the mainland seem to have. The atmosphere is comfy and the workers are super nice. My family ended up coming here on Halloween for bunch and all the waitresses and Brenda were dressed up in Halloween costumes. It made me feel like I was at home and it was okay that I was missing Halloween. I really enjoyed the fact that I could watch the cooks make the food.   I ended up getting breakfast and so did my mom and grandma. I got to tell you their portions are HUGE!!!! I got a three egg omelet with bacon and tomatoes, home fried potatoes and a biscuit. All of it was delicious and a bit heavy. I could not finish it all. I think my favorite thing was the biscuit. It was light, fluffy and dense just a country style biscuit should be!!!!   If you don't come here for the service come here for the food. It may be tucked away in Sun City but I still would make the trek down here!

Not a fan!!!! The service was good. The waitress was a little slow but she apologized for being slow and brought me a lot of coffee which I appreciated because I was up before 7am that day.  The reason I'm not a fan is because of the food.  I realize this is IHOP and the food isn't supposed to be fantastic but it's supposed to be represented corrected by the pictures on the menu and warm right? I ended up getting the fit and free breakfast meal. Which consisted of two scrambled substitute eggs, dry toast, a cup of fruit and two pieces of turkey bacon. Sounds good right? I thought it would be too!   When the food came out I was super dissappointed. I ended up getting half an egg, a bowl of spoiled fruit that I couldn't eat, turkey bacon and toast. The toast was good but can you really mess up toast? The turkey bacon was chewy and my eggs were cold. I really wish they would have told me there was not going to be as much food as advertised or I would have gotten something different.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE Sheplers.   I think I may be a boot snob but when I came to Arizona I went to THREE different boot stores before I came to Sheplers. Apparently the boots I was looking for are rare. I actually came here on a whim and the first thing I asked them was "Do you have any leather/wood bottom boots." And I didn't even have to explain why I needed it they steered me to Corral boots. Now, Corrals and I do not mix well so I asked for any other boots.   And guess what? They showed me these Ariats that had leather bottoms!!! Apparently when I'm trying on boots you can tell whether or not they are comfy by the face I make. And apparently I made a very happy face when I tried on these boots. All I had to do was put these boots on and I knew they were the ones for me. Walking in I thought I was going to spend at least $300 on boots. I ended up spending $250 on boots and other things.  The staff was super nice and even told me how to get to Toby Keith's. If I ended up living in Arizona because this is where all the red necks are and they are super nice. I felt I was among my people! Good Job Sheplers. You have awesome employees and my feet are very happy while I'm at work :)

I don't know why this place was getting so many bad reviews. As a lover of country music I was super stoked when I found out about this place.   I ended up making the trek from Sun City to Scottsdale and let me tell you it was worth it. As soon as we walking in I smelled a wonderful aroma of vanilla and bourbon and the wonderful waitress informed me that it's their signature scent and they infuse it in the air. It was awesome!!  As we sat down we were greeted by a very nice server who gave us the run down of the place. I looked at the liquor menu and man was it extensive. It had a really great selection of whiskey's and bourbons which is to be expected. But they also had a really great selection of beer there.   My grandma ended up getting the Dierks' lemonade which had whiskey and strawberry lemonade in it. I tried some of it and it was the perfect thing to be drinking in the dry Arizona air. Now when I went I was sick and I wanted some whiskey. But I also wanted a beer. Luckily, the waitress had the perfect solution. BEER COCKTAIL! Usually when you get a beer cocktail the liquor over powers the beer and all the beer does is provide a fizz. Not this cocktail! It had blackberry whiskey, fresh blackberries, pbr and their house sour. Everything complimented each other so well. It made a fantastic cocktail.   By the time I got my food I was a little buzzed but I was really impressed with the food. It was all down south comfort food presented with a gourmet twist. The presentation was gorgeous and the taste was amazing!! I got a chicken salad wrap with tomato bisque. I think it was the best meal I had in Arizona. What was cool was that everything on their menu is really simple but they do it so well it tastes amazing!!  This is a pretty cool place. When I was asked to described this place I said it was a country gastropub. Which is pretty accurate. I kind of wish I could have visited this place on the weekend. It sounded pretty cool!1
