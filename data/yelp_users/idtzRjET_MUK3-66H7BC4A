This place is THE TRUTH.  Went here a few weeks back w/ a few friends who also just recently turned 21 and since we obviously have never drank a drop of alcohol in our life (ha) we decided to check this place out for it's beer sampler.  I didn't really believe anybody when they told me that I just had to find the beer that was right for me because I honestly thought at that point ALL BEER was disgusting...  But then I found my best friend - PEACH ALE! Man that stuff is SO GOOD and a pitcher b/w 3-4 friends makes for a great time.  Food is legit, people are awesome, and there are multiple environments in which to hang out in. Large party? Get a table inside where it's a little louder. Here casually w a friend? Check the bar out. Trying to catch up over dinner and drinks w/ a small group? Try to sit outside.  This place is definitely a place to hit up even if you're in Tempe for just the weekend.  CHECK OUT THE OATMEAL VANILLA STOUT MILKSHAKE = THAT'S WHAT DREAMS ARE MADE OF.

BEST. PHO. IN. THE. VALLEY.  HIGH QUALITY PHO. HUGE PORTIONS. ACTUAL VIETNAMESE FAMILY MAKING THE FOOD.  The aforementioned points are very important for me. As someone who ranks pho as probably one of my most favorite foods in the world, I take pho restaurant critiquing very seriously.  Broth: 5 Stars - How do you tell if a pho restaurant is good from the get go? You order it. They bring it to your table. Get your spoon... and taste the broth. This is where the love and care shows, people! This place has some legit broth and it shows that they actually care for the food they are making.  Vegetables: 5 Stars  - Some places have nasty wilted bean sprouts... but at this place the veggies are always fresh. Good assortment of what's available: basil, bean sprouts, lime, jalapenos and some sort of cabbage-like leaf that has a great peppery taste.  Spring Rolls: 5 Stars - A lot of places has this pre-made, but this place makes it to order. You can tell because when you bite into it, you can tell the pork was just recently grilled.  The only tough this is they may forget to fill up your water cup just because it's so busy.  As a Seattle native who's in the area for school, I had gone to many other places only to be incredibly disappointed. Back in my hood, pho places are just as numerous as Starbuck's and a good place is hard to find. Coming into this restaurant reminds me of going to some of my favorite places back home... I'll always be a Khai Hoan-er for Life!

When this place first opened, I was ALL ABOUT IT.  Their chai is so legit and that coupled w/ their SUPER CHEAP and SUPER BOMB hummus plate - my poor college student self was good to go (It was $3, a great deal for the amount you got... especially when you're on the all M&G meal plan like I am). I was the happiest kid on campus.  Then I walk in one day and see that they switched their wondrously soft pita for what I can only guess is a disgusting piece of extremely stale and disgustingly dry triangle piece of tortilla that felt like it had been sitting in the sun for years. My heart broke.  E^SQUARED! If you're reading this, switch back to the old pita! If not... I'm afraid I'll have to go back to my usual diet of chunky strawberry yogurt/oatmeal blends at Jamba Juice.  Where can an ASU student get some healthy food that actually tastes good on campus?!?!?

Izzy just killed the barber game. 25 years and I've never had a cut this good. If I get rich I'm going to invest in him to have his own shop in Seattle.
