I get that's it's a "country" inn but for god sake country music sucks and sucks to party to. They play hip hop every tenth or so song and the dance floor fills up. Then back to 20 country songs and watching the same three couples do the same damn spin moves around the floor. This shit would never survive in Cali and by the looks of it in a Saturday night, it's barely surviving here. Piece of business advice- know your customer and what they want.

Do not use their delivery service! We ordered our food and it took almost two hours to deliver it. I called the restaurant and apparently the driver was looking for the house. Okay. Maybe he should be calling me then instead of the other way around. I always use app delivery services but this time I just went with yelp. In the future I will know better.  No surprise the food was cold. Ugh.

Been sitting here for an hour waiting. No one has acknowledged us. However, the doctor is awesome! He is a cat whisperer and the dogs love him. Worth the wait.

I ordered my wife flowers to be delivered on her birthday. No show, no call, no flowers. Which makes me look like I dropped the ball. I cannot say how disappointed I am. I called the next day and she didn't even really apologize. She said the driver had a busy day but was dropping them off today instead. Well for one, she isn't at work today and two IT IS NOT HER BIRTHDAY TODAY. Very unprofessional. Yelp let me down on this one, I will never order from them again.
