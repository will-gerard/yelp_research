Order the Moscow Mule; I promise, you will not be disappointed.  It's a great bar; a gem in douche land that is AZ.  Great drinks, great service, most times.  I've been quite a few times and it depends on who the hostess/waitress is.  One girl is friendly, fun and attentive, the other is cold, annoyed by your presence, and unhelpful.  The bartenders are knowledgeable and friendly.    All in all, a great place to grab a drink before a movie, or  a great place to simply enjoy the night with a group or the lucky lady (or man) in your life.

This is a great store.  The men's section is wonderfully edited with a great selection from their many lines (blue label, black, purple, RRL, Golf).  My favorite area in the store is their furnishings/suiting section.  A wonderful selection of ties, pocket squares, and dress shirts.  When you go in be sure to ask for Chuck.

If you're looking for a place that has an awesome lunch menu, a great selection of hard to find wines, a great selection of specialty drinks, awesome nick nacks, the best desserts in town (baked in house), and a great selection of specialty cheeses and salami, you have found nirvana!    I come to LGO at least once a week (on most occasions 3 times a week) and always walk out with a bottle of wine or some sort of cheese or baked good.  Their gelato, dare I say it, is better than Gelato Spot.   Overall great spot to come and enjoy lunch.    One complaint though: parking is a nightmare most times.  I hope they expand to a larger location with ample parking.

This is simply the best cleaner in the nation.  Those looking for an inexpensive cleaner, be warned, Rave is pricey, but worth every dollar spent.    I wear suits and sport coats on a daily basis and have had horrible experiences with various cleaners.  Issues from cracked buttons, to them not pressing the jacket correctly, I was fed up.  I met Stu at my place of employment (they offer free pick up and delivery service at my place of employment) and told me about his establishment.  I decided to give him a try.     Well, a week later I spilled espresso on my trousers.  I tried my local cleaners but they were unable to get a simple coffee stain out.  I finally tried Rave, sent my whole suit to be cleaned, and it came back a week later looking like new.  The lapels are hand pressed thus giving it that roll factor (there is nothing worse than a suit with lapels that have no life). For those that have had a suit made, albeit bespoke or MTM, you understand the importance of a lapel brimmed with life.  I've also had a wonderful 3 button roll sport coat (3 button coat that looks like a 2 button) cleaned and was pleased when it came back pressed to accommodate the roll.   I also love the fact that Rave will take the buttons off and have your coat cleaned and then sow them back on.  No more cracked horn buttons!! Yes!!  Lastly, Rave is a miracle worker when it comes to white shirts.  The shirt Rave cleaned was my first custom shirt ever by Zegna.  It had obvious signs of wear, many laundering, an the god awful yellow armpit stains.  Rave was able to make the shirt look brand new!    In conclusion, if you're looking for a "cheap" cleaner, Rave is not the cleaner for you.   But remember, you get what you pay for.  Rave FabriCARE is worth every penny.  And on a final note, Rave is used by Savile Row tailors.  If the best suit makers in the world use Rave, then you know that Rave is simply the best.

Wow, the selection is severely outdated and screams I'm a Scottsdale douche still stuck in the early 2000's!  The service was just as bad!  I walk in and there is no sales person in sight but I here voices of three people rambling on a about a botched special order.  I look through the store making my way through the Robert Graham room (who the hell still wears that crap) and down the line to their suiting/trouser selection.  I even walk by the counter where the sales people are chatting and not one greats me.  I was over dressed compared to the standards of the United States and definitely compared to the shit they carry in this store.    Overall, I'm giving them a horrible review on their customer service but their merchandise has to be updated if they want to last another 5 years in AZ.

The best Thai food in the valley.  The service is great, their selection of curry is phenomenal, and the food is just fantastic.  I come here at least once a month and I have yet to have a bad experience with this establishment.

HUB has changed a lot since Tom left.  Their customer service took a nose dive, the selection is not as great, but I will give them a pass since their space is smaller now.  HUB was the place to go if you're looking for hard to find brands but now with Barneys in the mix, their selection is no longer impressive.  I understand the space is smaller, but you can still differentiate your selection to stay competitive.    Oh yeah, and whoever the new owner is, please tell your sales people to stop texting when there are clients in the shop.  I was in the shop for 5 minutes before the dude noticed I was in their.

This is the best thin crust pizza i have ever had!  Make sure you get the Weird Guy when you order!   It is worth the 2 hours plus we stood in line waiting.

This is a gem in central phoenix.  The food is amazing!  I have only one complaint: carry more German/Belgian beers.  Every "hip" place carries local beer, differentiate yourself.    Other than that, I love this place!

Your business has the word "Jean" as part of its name.  You would assume, nay, expect,  the employees to be denim experts.  That is simply not the case with this establishment.    My girlfriend and I were in the area, just passing the day shopping.  I've heard good things about this store and finally decided to check it out.  We walked in, we parted ways, my girlfriend to the woman's area, myself to the men's area.  I look around, see that they carry Diesel, A.G. and some other awful denim brands.  A salesperson by the name of Coco greeted me and asked if I needed help.  I asked if they carried any raw selvedge denim.  To my utter surprise, she asks what raw denim was!!  ARE YOU KIDDING ME? You work in a store specializing in denim!  Selvedge denim is HUGE in menswear now.  I guess this is what I get from a store that specializes in douche wear.  I found my gf and immediately left the store in utter disgust.    This place gets one star only because they carry a good selection of Kiehls, which is an amazing skincare line.  But you're better off going to Saks Fifth Ave for they have a bigger selection.

Once you get past the froo frooness of the shop, the actual experience is quite pleasant.   My girlfriend had wanted to take me here for quite sometime.  I hesitated because it was a very girly thing to do.  I finally obliged her and was surprised.  We ordered the Duchess of Bedford's Formal Afternoon Tea.  It was simply amazing.  Our tea was the Chocolate Rose.  The service was prompt and great and we also got to meet the owner, an Englishwoman, so this place is very authentic.    Just an FYI, I advise placing a reservation beforehand.  We got lucky but got a not so ideal table.    In short, if you want to be a good boyfriend and score points with the woman in your life, oblige her girly side and you'll be rewarded ;)

Compared to their other locations, the Scottsdale location is small and carries nothing.  But when you look at how horrible people dress in our fine state, then you know why this Barneys doesn't carry Rick Owens, or Junya Watanabe like their other locations.    Yes, the selection is lacking, but the menswear selection is the best in the whole state.  It is wonderful edited with simple, classic, modern essentials.  The most eccentric designer they carry on the men's floor is Etro, and that is conservative compared to what the L.A. or NYC locations carry.  If you're looking for jeans, they have a wonderful selection ranging from A.P.C., Nudie, to your basic AG's and Levi's (the made in U.S.A. line).  Their shoe selection is small but edited.  They carry Harry's of London, Crockett & Jones, to Lanvin sneakers.  The suiting area is a bit of a disappoint.  The used to carry Kiton and Isai, but at least they still have Etro, Armani Collezioni, and their private brand (made by Canali).  Niemen's suiting selection is better, but Barney's is still able to compete.  Their dress shirts and tie selection is the best I have seen.  I know of no one else carrying Duchamp or Richard James ties.  I was ecstatic when I saw this location carried Guy Rover dress shirts.  They also have Isai shirts and ties (as of 3 months ago at least).    In conclusion, though Barney's may be small, the selection is wonderfully edited.  The service is top notch and the staff is very helpful and will answer your questions.

Simply the best haircut I have received.  David, the  owner of the barbershop/salon is not only good at his job, he is fun and interesting to chat with.  We covered a breadth of topics from manufacturing moving to China to how colleges attract recruits.   When I went in last year, my old hair guy moved out of town.  I'm always at Postino or LGO and I've always seen Dylan's.  I finally decided to give him a try.  I was skeptical at first because most stylists don't know how to cut a man's hair properly.  Not only does David cut like a barber should, he lines up your neck with a straight razor and he is also offers shaves.    Warning!: When you schedule and appointment, make sure to ask for David, the owner.  I gave my name when I scheduled my 4th visit thinking I would get David but I instead got one of the other stylists who cut my hair adequately, but not as good as David.

Great place to grab hard to find brews.  The food is fantastic and your typical beer food (not healthy).    The Main Ingredient is located in a converted house and is right next door to Humble Pie.  Service was great, especially since it was extremely busy.    I have only one complaint and that is the lack of beers on tap.  Please expand the selection of beers on tap.    I will be back very soon!

Royal has two locations in the Biltmore.  The original location is under the Red Door Spa and next door to Ralph Lauren and Capital Grill.  The second location in the Biltmore is at the new Union.    I work in the Biltmore area and Royal is a short 5 min walk away.  Their coffee is simply amazing!   This is how coffee should taste.  The Barista's are well trained and know what they are doing.  Haze, the owner, has simply gone to great lengths to hire great, talented people.  A conversation  with the owner or the barista's is just as good as their coffee.    The atmosphere is great as well but I wish they has more chairs with backs as opposed to stools and high tables.  Other than that, the best coffee house in Phoenix.

Want to impress the lady in your life?  Want to experience authentic French cuisine, made by a French chef, at an affordable price?  Then come experience the fantastic La Petite France.    I took my girlfriend here for Valentine's Day and we both fell in love with this place.  The restaurant is under new ownership and is run by a lovely French duo (a couple maybe?).  They specialize in southern French cuisine with everything from the crepes to their wine selection.  Try one of the crepes and you must try their Cremé Bruleé. All in all, our experience was fantastic and we will be back again.

This is the second time I've been back since my last review and my experience simply gets better and better every time.  The owner is a wonderful Frenchwomen and the chef a Frenchman.  The chef explained  how he makes everything (and I mean everything) from scratch.  It simply makes the difference.    Last night, we ordered the escargot (wow!), French Onion soup, the Crepe Provencal followed by a wonderful mouse based pastry for dessert.    What I love about this place is the value.  Not only is everything made from scratch, it is authentic French cuisine.  A few places around the valley call themselves French, but they aren't. This place is the most authentic in the valley and the prices!! wow the prices are phenomenal!  It isn't cheap but it isn't expensive given the ingredients they use and the time it takes to make everything from scratch.    By far my very restaurant in the valley; I shall be back many times.    BTW, the brunch here is amazing!

Cave & Ives is a floor above Sacks Sandwich.    The food here is amazing!  The pizza is very good, their meet and cheese board is phenomenal!  If you're a beer snob like I am,  you are in beer heaven!  Over 80 beers available from all over the world!  I highly recommend this place if you're looking to unwind after a long day at work.

I just purchased my 2nd pair of jeans from this great denim store, Naked and Famous slim Dirty Selvedge.  The selection is not what it used be though.  On prior visits, they used to carry A.P.C., and other denim brands direct from Japan  I've never heard of.  Hands down, they have the best selection of Naked and Famous but I would like to see other hard to find denim brands like Raleigh, Simon Miller.  I also want to walk in and discover a new denim brand, a brand that is not carried at other stores in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  If you're looking for RRL, they have a small selection, but still well edited.    In short, Industrie is still a good spot to buy denim because the staff is very knowledgeable and actual denim heads; they will not steer you wrong.

It's a great place with great food!  It is a bit pricey for what you get, but the atmosphere is great for a chain restaurant.  The service is top notch; the bar tenders are very chatty which is always great.  Overall, a great place.     I'm not a fan of their beer selection though, very average.  I hope they expand their selection to carry more upscale beers like Trappistes Rochfort or Duvvel.

25+ beers on tap and none are uber mainstream!  I love discovering hidden gems in the central/downtown area and this is my latest discovery.  My mates have been raving about this place and I finally found time to grab a brew with them.  The decor is your typical modern/hipster with a twist of vintage thrown in.  The bartender that night was a lovely young lady who I recognized from Roosevelt Bar (which is now closed).  She was very knowledgeable and gave me wonderful recommendations based off of what I normally drink.    In short, this is a great place to grab a brew and reconnect with mates you haven't had time to see.  I will be here again very soon.

It's a great bazaar of locally owned shops in a very unique mall.  The Biltmore has been reinventing itself and the Union is a great start.    For clothes horse like myself, check out Bonafide Goods.  This shop carries Billy Reid, New England Shirt Company, an edited assortment of raw denim, and kick ass bow ties (that my lovely girlfriend bought for me).  The staff here is very friendly, knowledgeable and just awesome.    For a bite to eat, check out Trattoria del Piero.  Get the Kalamata sandwich and ask that the bread not be pressed; you will not regret it.   Afterwards, go to the Whoopi Pie station right next door for dessert; again, you will not regret this.    The Union also features some awesome home shops, boutiques for the fairer sex, a sunglass shop, and sweet bike shop.  Lastly, it also has a magazine stand that could use more of a selection (get the Economist!).    In all, I give this place 5 stars for making shopping in Phoenix better, for having unique shops that are locally owned, and for just having a sweet atmosphere.  You will not regret coming to this mini bazaar.

Del Piero is very modern and as a Euro look.  The said can be said about their serving sizes; ie small compared to American standards.  The serving sizes are small, but they are satisfying and leave your hunger fulfilled without feeling like you overate. Prior reviewers have complained about the serving size and price ratio but the quality of ingredients justify the price.  On a lighter note, I recommend the Kalmatra (I hope I spelled it right), their best sandwich.    The bartender was also very knowledgeable about his beers and spirits.  Overall the decor and very modern, the atmosphere is very intimate.

I work in the Biltmore area and I was happy to see this place open.  My hair was cut by a gentleman named Nate and this was simply one of the best, if not the best, haircut I received in quite sometime.   If you're looking for a good cut at prices that are not outrageous then I highly recommend this place.    I'll review my shaving experience in about a week.

Nate is now my new barber.  He is simply amazing at what he does.  He's also a down to earth guy and easy to talk to and joke around with.  I love the Groom Room because it has a relaxed atmosphere and you can shoot the shit with the guys working there, like a true barbershop should be.    I promised a review on my shave and it was great!  You start out with a hot towel wrapped around your face (don't worry, they don't cover your nose) to relax your skin, open up your pores, and relax the whiskers.  Then a pre-shave oil is spread onto your face followed by the shaving cream.  Next, the shaving proceeds.  Throughout the shave, Nate asked if the pressure he was applying was to much or to little.  After the shave, a cold towel is wrapped around your face to close the pores followed by after shave being applied.    Overall, my shave experience was phenomenal.  My overall experience with the Groom Room has been exceptional.  I have now had my hair cut by Nate 4 times and will continue to come back.

I've been a regular of Royal's since they opened and was extremely joyful when they opened near ASU.  The staff is top notch and know you by name if you're a regular;  you can't beat that old school service.    I highly recommend this place

Willie is the barber to see!  He's the only original left from when they first opened.  Willie has been cutting my hair since he was with the Groom Room and when he moved here, I naturally followed him.  I've known him for 3 plus years and he has never given me a bad cut.  Go see him if you want a consistent cut.

I've been sold.  I was told that in order to get a promotion Tmobile was running I had to purchase $100 worth of accessories all while being told that this promotion will lower my bill. Well, I got my bill today, it's higher than my old bill and imagine my utter shock when the customer service representative told me that 1) the promotion is not condusive on my purchasing of accessories 2) the promotion will not lower my bill.    I was also surprised when I learned that this location is not operated by T-Mobile.    Beware of this store, they use predatory sales techniques and are out to rip you off.  Go to the Tmobile owned store a few miles away.   To the operator: please stop using lies in order to get a sale. I will never step foot into your store again and will make sure all my friends, family, and clients never step foot into any store you operate
