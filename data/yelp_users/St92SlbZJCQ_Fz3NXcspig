I've tried this spot several times because I love the location, atmosphere and music, but the food and service really leave me wanting. The food menu is very limited. The bread on my focaccia sandwich had no flavor and seemed almost "cardboardy." The prosciutto was rubbery. There were people smoking on the patio within 5 feet from the door which was blowing right to our table. I inquired about this with the server (it's not legal in Arizona), but I was met with apathy and a shrug. Add more variety and quality to the menu and service and this spot will be great. Drink menu is one plus. Good options there!

The outdoor patio in cool weather is great. Food is yummy. The sangria is amazing and the other cocktails are really good too.

This is the most authentic Italian Gelateria I've been to in Arizona. The owner, Alberto, is very friendly and welcoming. Absolutely amazing!!! Definitely eat here!
