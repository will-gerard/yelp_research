Very prompt and clean.  Basic good service is all I need when it comes to dry cleaning and repairs.  They got a couple very bad stains out, which I thought might be impossible.  Maybe a little pricey, but being right next to Starbucks kind of makes up for this!  And they have a talking register, which is pretty cool too.

Not good at all.  To make a long story short.  Ordered (and paid for) 2 parts, one came in right the other, just never came, nobody called, nobody could give me a straight answer.   Other than we can't control the shipping company.  They have a lot of people working there, just taking orders, not thinking it seems.  After 7 days and the part still not in, one employee finally made a few calls (after I got upset of course).  My part was returned to somebody else at a different parts company.  That made no sense to me.  I paid for the part, went to the store 3 times and still no part.  It had been cancelled or returned or whatever. Very frustrating!! We can order you another one... No thank you!  They handled refund professionally and were appologetic though.

This place is not new, but it's the real deal.  Staff walks the walk, not just talking about healthy and organic....like some other places.  Their juice drinks are 100% SO GOOD.  It's a little more $$$ than a lot of other lunch places, but you definately get what you pay for.  They have cooking classes you can sign-up for ( I always mean to, but never do).  The pizza is not like any pizza ever...really creative with the menu too.  I love the way it smells in there too!

I have been going here for a few years now.  Tried it out because of 'green' alternative...(most dry cleaners use a lot of chemicals), but stayed because of the service.  Which is AMAZING!!  That is all have to say.  Very, very, very good customer service.  If they think it took too long, or didn't come out right or whatever...they reduce or waive the fee.  And I have never had a problem with their work quality, they maintain very high standards and to top it all off...They are REALLY NICE!!!

Clean and cute.   Oh yeah and good food.  Service is pretty good, a little slow when they get busy, which is a lot because it's not very big.  They have wooden menus!!!

Fast and yummy...granted I usually just get the Pho, but I love it.  I can add as much or as little veggies and sauce as I want.   I go there ALOT (coffee is sooooooo good). I just love it!

I am all about saving money and the planet.  Also, they are fast and professional.  Once I had to return a cartridge that didn't work (kind of a pain, but ok because location is pretty convenient to me)  and they switched it out right away.  They have punch refill cards (10th is free) which motivates me to keep going to them.  And like I mentioned, they REUSE!!  So it's good for the environment..."refill don't landfill". Really good motto!!

This guy (Sewall) is on the ball.  Long story short, he did everything right.  Which means, he did what he said he was going to do.  On time, fast and informative.  I love it when this happens.  Oh yeah and reasonably priced...
