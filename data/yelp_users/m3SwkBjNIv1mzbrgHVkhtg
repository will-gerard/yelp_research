You would think that after consistent dinner rushes on Fridays an establishment would plan accordingly with staff coverage.  Apparently not.  The last 3 (yes three!) times my husband and I have been here we have had to wait for a number of items to be made for our order.  I can appreciate that it's fresh, but during dinner time shouldn't this stuff be done ahead of time?  This last trip may have been the breaking point.  Only 2 people behind the counter putting orders together, and they clearly didn't work well together.  One couldn't remember whose order was what (remember we had to wait for food) and couldn't recall if people had paid and needed to see a receipt from every other person.  All in all, the food isn't worth the annoyance of the service, location, parking issues, etc...  Go anywhere else.

Having been to Harold's for lunch before, I figured it would be a great place to come to again when in the area. I was wrong.  Oh so wrong.  We (my husband and I) were seated right away, which is great!  No wait!  However, we sat waiting for ANYONE to acknowledge us after that for at least 10 minutes.  Another couple was seated after us and was greeted before we were... By the same server.    We ordered drinks and our food at the same time in hopes to save time since we allotted about an hour for lunch, and our drinks came out within a few minutes.  And then we waited some more. Other servers, a guy that looked like a manager, food runners, OUR server (Kylie is her name) they all walked by numerous times. 40 minutes with no update about when the food might come, another table updated on their to-go order, and FINALLY our order came.  I asked for the bill right away in order to expedite things further (which was the smoothest process of the entire visit).  The food left a lot to be desired. My husbands "BBQ burger" had no BBQ sauce, was missing toppings, and was incredibly unevenly over cooked (an edge was pink-ish, the rest was well done and was ordered medium).  My BLT was fine, but the bacon wasn't consistently cooked and my fries were room temperature.  We would have sent it back, but we might still be there 5 hours later.  I won't be back anytime soon.  Even locals know not to come here unless there's an event because apparently that's the only time servers know they'll make money.  Sad.

I tried the *NEW* (or at least it's marked that way) Bear Claw French Toast.  Holy cannoli, it was good!  I'm STILL full over 4 hours later and I didn't even finish the entire thing.    My husband had a meat lovers omelette and devoured it.  He wasn't a huge fan of the hash browns (he orders them burnt and they never come out that way - I suppose the kitchen is just trying to cover their behinds lol) but that's not a deal breaker for this place.  Seriously, HUGE portions.  Fast service on a weekday morning is a big plus!

This place needs an overhaul.  I hadn't been here ever - and now I know why I avoided it.  D-bag bartenders.  Over-inflated drink prices for underpoured glasses.  Food that looked pitiful.  Mismatched bar stools. A "buffet" that looked like it had been there all day on a Saturday.  Do yourself a favor, avoid this place.  Ya know unless you enjoy a bartender that shouts "Kobe!!" as he tosses things into receptacles and encourages napkins to be thrown like confetti all over the floor.  Never again.

Huge sized servings that are definitely cooked from scratch.  This place is family friendly and the employees are busy, but still nice.  If you're planning on going on a Sunday, get there early! It seems this place is busiest after "church hours" and you'll have a wait!

Picture it, Sunday afternoon, just after 4 pm, driving around trying to find a last minute unplanned pedicure. We drove by and turned around to see if they were slammed.  We were walk-ins, about 45 minutes before closing and they took us.  They even stayed late to finish us up.  My feet were terrible.  On the verge of embarrassing.  Winter was not kind to my poor toes. Sam did my pedicure and made my feet presentable again just in time for sandal season!  I will be back and recommend this nail salon to anyone!

I've been here a handful of times now, always without an appointment and I have never been turned away.  I've gotten great service from everyone I've dealt with, and the people are so personable and nice!  This last time I went with my husband and the owner recognized me from my Yelp review :)  Love this place, I'll continue coming as long as they'll have me!

I'm updating my review again!  As per usual, I came in without an appointment with my husband and we were taken right away.  My pedicure and gel mani were done at the same time, my husband got a pedicure too which seemed to last longer than mine as odd as it was.  They've hired on new techs so that there is no need to wait on services anymore which is great, but it seems like they're still working some things out with where people work in the salon.  Nothing major, just a lot of moving around to get nails dry and whatnot.  I came back in because my pedicure polish was wonky, and it was fixed with LOTS of apologies (totally unneeded as they fixed it) and I've had no other issues.  I'll keep coming back here assuming the quality remains what it has been in the past.

We checked in at Harrah's Ak-Chin on 4/12/13 for our one year anniversary getaway.  Everything was fine for the first few hours, then it all started to hit the fan. The room we were in was fine... at first.  The TV in the room, however, seemed posessed; turning itself on and off randomly.  We called facilities to get it taken care of and it was "fixed" Friday night.  Saturday mid-day it started again.  Facilities came out, changed out the card...and it continued.  Add to that the barking dogs in the next room (the PetStay rooms were overbooked apparently) until at least 9 pm and starting again this morning (4/14/13) at 6:30 am, and you'd think I'd be done.  I'm not.  Last night in the Oasis Lounge there was a performance my husband and I wanted to see.  We showed up and were told that seating was only for those with wristbands or VIP status, and standing in a walkway of any sort was not feasible.  Well, it's not marketed in that way.  In fact online it states "no admission, no reservations needed".  Nowhere does it state that there is a need for a wristband, etc. That brings me to Agave's.  We went for breakfast both days, however the 2nd day was ONLY because it was comped due to the aforementioned issues.  The first morning I had something god awful in my soda.  It appeared that some sort of dark black-ish mold was on a piece of ice.  The cups for soda weren't fully cleaned (as evidenced by the remnant color on the bottom of the glass) as well.  Don't waste your time, money, or gas driving out here just because it's got an awesome pool.  I STILL smell like cigarettes, and I don't even smoke!

Poorly executed.  Not a lot of variety available, considering the vast array of craft beers out there.  The venue was good and kept comfortable with a/c, and everything was kept clean.  "VIP" tickets weren't really much better than the general admission, considering the early admittance was marred by closed/locked doors and slow moving lines to gain actual admittance.  I wouldn't do it again, not worth the money.

My "go-to" in Westgate.  It's not everyone's cup of tea, but the food and drinks are much better than most in the area.  If you're lucky enough to have Terry as your bartender, you'll be taken care of.  Mixed drinks are made well and he's personable!    Try it for Sunday Funday - can't beat their Bloody Mary and mimosa deals!

I'd give them 5 stars, but it's my first time at this place.  If the service stays as prompt and thorough as it was today I will revisit this and up the star-grade.  It's a small, clean location.  You walk in, sign in, and get called back to a chair.    I just needed my brows cleaned up, so I can't speak to how well they shape brows (mine are minimal and getting tattooed), but I also needed my upper lip done (don't judge!) and that was done very well.  My eyes watered, but they do from plucking too.  The girl that threaded me was nice and quick.  Go check this place out!

I'm not usually a fan of cake doughnuts, but thought I'd give this place a try.  I'm glad I did, but I wasn't blown away. There's a simple ordering process, the donuts are made fresh and to order, and you're in and out pretty quickly considering what's going on with the doughnuts. I ordered a Strawberry Princess (don't judge me!) thinking it would be extremely sweet.  My husband made his own with maple glaze and bacon.  We left with still hot donuts in a box and headed home.  We have now sampled these doughnuts, and while it's not at all what I expected, it's not terrible.  My Princess didn't taste like anything but the cake itself.  No strawberry flavoring to be found.  The maple glaze is flavorless as well, according to my husband.  If the glazes were a bit stronger/more potent I would be back here weekly.  The doughnuts themselves are really good, but not enough to draw me back time and again.  It's a great concept and an awesome location, but not my favorite dessert option in the vicinity.

My husband and I were looking forward to visiting Crave for weeks.  We weren't entirely impressed.   Waffle sandwiches are an amazing idea, and the offerings all look tempting - and then your sandwich (wafflewich?) shows up with room temperature meat and slightly undercooked and cold waffles.  Did you hear that???  It was my dreams shattering.  Food was delivered in shifts, waffles and then fries, but at least the fries were warm. Oh but the beer was cold...and being attacked by fruit flies.  Yum!  We were told by one of the bartenders that she makes sure people put an extra coaster on top of their beer when they aren't drinking because of this.  I know this place is pretty new and still working out some kinks, but wow.  I'm not sure that I'll be back.

Finally had a chance to come in and try out some beer.  I was not disappointed.  The bartender (Brent) was knowledgable, personable, and fast on his feet.    All around, this was a great experience.  I can't wait to see some more of the seasonal brews!

My husband picked up dinner to go here last night.  He came home with a ton of food! Huge portions don't even begin to describe it.  Heaping servings of noodles and meat both. I had spring rolls and they weren't oily/greasy like can be found at Panda.  The food doesn't taste processed (though I'm sure it is) which is a step above Panda as well.  After reading mixed reviews on the orange chicken I was apprehensive on trying it, but got it anyway - how can you screw up orange chicken right?  I will agree it is different than Panda, but not in a bad way.  You get more chicken than breading, and the flavor is a bit lighter which seems to be the polar opposite of Panda also.  All in all, I'll try this place again.  I'll get a bowl instead of a plate though since I couldn't even come close to finishing my meal!  It's cheaper, closer, and faster than Panda - and they've got a drive through.  Give it a shot!
