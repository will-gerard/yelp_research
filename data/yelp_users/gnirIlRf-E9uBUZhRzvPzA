I like that location. Anytime I ordered by phone they are very nice . Pei Wei is my second kitchen. My favorite are Kung Pao Shrimp and noodles

Once upon a time, I said to myself, "I would never, ever, drink veggie-blended soup!" But my life changed when I took a sip of their butternut squash soup that my mom ordered *insert heavenly music*  It. Was. AMAZING. I couldn't believe it was butternut squash. Actually, I still don't believe it. How is it possible that a veggie-blended soup could taste soooo good?  Don't let the word "butternut" scare you! Just give it a try~

Been to numerous Filiberto's(es?) in the Valley, this one is definitely the best, hands down. Totally agree with what Kayla R. said.   The ladies who work there are super-duper friendly. I only go there once a week; nonetheless they always remember me and what I ordered! Amazing people.  The Arizona burrito (steak, cheese, potato) is sooooo good. I really love how they are never stingy with their meat. And on Mondays, they have 99cent rolled tacos. I don't eat corn tortilla, I don't even eat their regular tacos (which my brother loves), but for some reason I absolutely love their beef rolled tacos. They are so generous with their cheese and by the time we got home it would be all melted on top of the three rolled tacos.MMMM  Their carne asada burrito is great too! Oh, and their carne asada fries! Sometimes it could be a guacamole overload. If you don't like that, you can ask them to put it on the side.   A special that is not on the drive-thru menu is the Texas burrito. My brother is absolutely in love with it. It is a chicken burrito with sour cream. It didn't sound appealing at first, but when my bro insisted, I tried it, which turned out interesting in a good way. BTW their burritos are not expensive at all, $4 something each.   Since I love spicy food, I always get their super hot red salsa. They also have the green salsa, and the brown mild salsa. Pickled carrots, jalapenos and onion are also available for the customers.   Next time when you get a burrito, try this: take a bite, when you get to the meat part, put some onion on it, pour some hot salsa on it, take a big bite and enjoy. And that's what heaven is like. 0=) Except you don't have to wait, b/c it's 24/7! Woohoo!

Totally excited to try this place out, my grandparents, my mom and I (4 of us) came here for some Korean food. It wasn't too busy; just pairs of people from nearby offices coming in and out.   Unlike other Korean restaurants, their lunch special selection is very limited. Special A  consists of a sushi roll with a soda, special B = teriyaki beef/chicken (no soda), or special C, Korean BBQ Spicy Chicken.   As we were looking at the "lunch special" board, the lady behind the counter insisted that we should look at their full price menu instead. Here comes the awkward part: she then asked my mom "are you Chinese?" Even though she is, my mum looked at me all puzzled as in "what does that mean?" The lady proceeded by pointing at the "seafood pancake" section on the menu and saying "I don't know why but you Chinese like this pancake a lot." Good thing my mom didn't hear what she said.. or else...   So we got the Spicy Chicken lunch special ($6.99), a bulgogi ($6.99), and a beef yakisoba ($7.19). The cool thing about this place is that it has a mini "kimchi" buffet bar, with trays of marinated tofu, potato, bean sprout, kimchi, broccoli and some other vegetables. It also has this delicious house special hot sauce.   By the time we finished a dish of kimchi, the food came, so it didn't take long. The spicy chicken, came in a bowl about the size of an instant-noodle bowl (but slightly deeper), was tender, with rice underneath it. The chicken was definitely marinated well; however, the last couple of pieces had tendons and big chunks of fat... what a bad way to end it. The bulgogi also came in a bowl, with rice underneath. The beef was definitely not marinated fully. The color was super light and the beef was close to tasteless. The biggest disappointment, food-wise, was the beef yakisoba. The noodles, occupying most of the Styrofoam lunch box, were sweet. Then there was an ice-cream scoop of rice, topped with 3 pieces, I kid you not, THREE pieces of dog-tag-sized, super-dry meat.   In the end, we just decided to bring the barely-touched yakisoba home for my younger brother (well, teenage boys tend to eat everything...). While my mom transfered the noodles to the plastic bowl (since the Styrofoam box was lidless), I went to ask for a plastic cover. This is the best part: the same lady, stared at me, pointed at the salad bar and said "you can't take that home". I thought there was a miscommunication, so I asked again for a lid for the noodles. Again, she pointed at the salad bar and said "you are not allowed to take the kimchi home". Wow seriously? Just b/c my grandparents are Chinese you assumed we were stashing kimchi in a bowl and trying to sneak it out? "Look, I just want to take my noodles home, ok?" She hesitantly gave me a lid.  "Hey, hey you. we chineness peple no steal kimchi becuz Confucius say 'no stealing kimchi'"... only if I said that to her face...  Oh, and when we got home, my brother, aka our food dumpster, took a bite of the yakisoba and never touched it again.    Conclusion: If you want amazing Korean food and friendly customer service, please just go to Chodang. Chodang is WAYYY BETTER, hands down
