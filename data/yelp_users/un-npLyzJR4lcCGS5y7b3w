Stopped by here to have lunch since it was really close to work. I love the upbeat personality of the owner. The service was great and everything was "good looking" and apetizing. Even the free fruit water that I was given was fancy with lemon and watermelons. The service was fast and I did not wait long for my food considering I only had an hour for lunch. I also noticed that a lot of the guests were regulars and that the owner had established good relationships with them. Looking forward to eating here again when I am back in the area since I have changed jobs.

Make sure to book an appointment before you come in here as your wait will last for more than an hour. The morning is especially full as a lot of people are fasting/ have to get things done before 10am(mind you these people walk in at 930am and complain that they have to get services done by 10am). So if you can come in the afternoon, that will probably be a better experience. The space is clean and the area is in a good spot.

The food here is excellent. We ordered a sausage and beef sandwich and vodka pasta and they both tasted great! The service is fast considering the fact that it was lunch time and busy. It does not have the typical restaurant feel since it is also a grocery and a deli but don't be discouraged. Larger groups are probably hard to sit but if there's just two to three people then there are plenty of spaces for everyone. I will definitely come back again for the food.

Always a good place to hangout with friends. I'm not a brewery girl so I'm not going to give any reviews on beers or anything. Everytime I come here I always get fries and wings as they are really good at Four Peaks. The only thing is that the waiting time for tables as well as parking is a little chaotic so if you come here don't expect to get seated right away. Also, you luck out with servers as I had some attentive servers and some not so much. Overall, good food and good atmosphere.

We were sat fairly quickly considering the fact that it was a Saturday morning and the place looked crowded. The space we sat on was a little small so be expected to be cramped in as the cafe is tiny. The food was decent but I got the eggs and canadian bacon so typical breakfast plate. Overall, ok price, ok presentation but the service is quick which is great! My first time at Harlow was not that great as I ordered food I did not like but this second time around, I liked it much better.

Mind you I have only tried their strawberry cake and raisin bread and it was very delicious! The strawberry cake was not too sweet and it was moist which is how I love my cakes. My boyfriend got the raisin bread which he eats with cream cheese for breakfast and he loves it a lot. Definitely going to go back and try out all their other desserts. I am hooked!

Really loved this place. There were so many selections of 'pie' and the ambience was great. Our server was top of her game and food was really really good. I ordered the cottage pie and the tandoori wings. I loved the wings and the pie esp the gravy. The portions were just right and the prices were not that expensive either. Such good food and great experience. Will for sure go back again.

Great deal for the buffet. They have a variety of foods for their buffet and they change it up here and there. Their Chicken Tikka Masala is really good. They also give you free naan bread with the buffet. The servers are a little unfriendly but just flag them down and ask for whatever you need and they'll give it to you.

My boyfriend and I got the $30 massage for an hour. Very relaxing and good atmosphere. We called for a same day appointment and they accomodated us. The people that massaged us were very respectful and polite. Also,  make sure to let them know if they are putting too much pressure or if it is too hard or if the water for your feet is too hot, they will accomodate. They are helpful. I will definitely come back for more.

The location is great if you are an ASU student and you just have to walk there. There isn't enough parking if you are driving there, you'd have to pay at a meter to park close. Luckily, we came here on a Sunday morning and the meters were free for parking. Table of 5 and got seated fairly quickly, we also got our food fairly quickly. Service is good but food is not so great, although the food presentation is nice. I am taking a star off because we were sweating as the AC was not working and we were promised that it would have been fixed in 15 minutes after we sat down but we finished eating and the AC was still not on. Personally there are better and cheaper breakfast places around Tempe.
