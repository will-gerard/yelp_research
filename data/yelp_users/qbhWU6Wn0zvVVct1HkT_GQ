Wow.  I just realized I have never Yelped about Hiro.  Way before Yelp, I reviewed Hiro on some other website, and I think what I wrote ended up on an award displayed on the restaurant's wall for being "best sushi" in Phoenix.  Anyway - About the food...  First and foremost, the fish is flown in DAILY.  Not once a week, not every other day, DAILY.  Ask what is fresh that day, and you are sure to get the freshest fish in town, even on a Sunday!  I love sashimi - no rice, no roll, just raw fish - and Hiro's is the tops.  While they haven't had it in a while, the Striped Jack is my all-time favorite, but give me any sweet, buttery, or somewhat firm fish from Hiro, and I am in heaven.  BTW, don't let the strip-mall location scare you away.  What it does say about this oh-so-awesome sushi bar  is that it is a place to get damned good sushi, not to be seen.  If you want the typical Scottsdale bar scene quasi-japanese restaurants better known for happy hour specials than fish, don't go to Hiro.  If you want the best sushi in the Southwest, take a drive to Hiro.

Wow!  Way more than a $6 car wash!  After a long hiatus from the proper care of my SUV plus a trip to the high country ( and 1,000 dead bugs to prove it) - my car desperately needed a wash.  Too busy to go for the works at Danny's or the like, I swung by this little drive through place to get the quick once over.  I didn't expect it to be perfect, or much better than ok.  I was pleasantly surprised!  The attendant at the start of the car wash rinsed, scrubbed, and sprayed the bugs off my windshield, grill, and back of my side view mirrors.   And the $6 includes towel dry and tire dressing,  In a hurry?  Feeling cheap?  Need your car to sparkle?  This place gets top marks from this Yelper!

Better than ever!  Fresh, delicious fish.  A variety of unique rolls.  I enjoyed the Maui roll and Super White Tuna sashimi.  Friendly staff.  Good prices.  High standards.  I'll be back... Often.

Wow.  I have NEVER not left a tip but my service was so horrible I put a big fat zero on the tip line.  What astonished me was when I went to give my paid check to the manager to make sure he knew how dissatisfied I was, I was told my horrible server was the manager!  That being said, the food is great and in the past I enjoyed eating at the sushi bar.  But I will NEVER eat at a table again and I will not take my family (meaning visits will be far and few between).    In family centric Anthem, this place will not survive with the current manager at the helm.  With the good food, I hope the problem is remedied soon.  Some specifics on the service: - It took forever to get our order taken so I took my boys on a walk while my husband ordered (plus, they failed to give us a pencil for our sushi order sheet). - When our first order of sushi came out, we didn't have any sushi sets.  When I asked our waiter/the manager for some, he looked at me like I was crazy and said, you mean the little bowls?  When I tried to also add we needed ginger and wasabi he seemed very confused and finally said, oh ginger. - It wasn't until after the tempura, then cucumber salad, then sushi order, and finally the next sushi order that he brought the kids meals out (by then, my kids were fit to be tied!).  He failed to bring a fork and knife.  I waited a bit, and finally ran around the restaurant to find him.  When I did, he said it would take a minute because he was entering in an order (mind you, I had a boy desperately waiting to eat his chicken fingers but the were huge and hot so they needed to be cut, he's 2, and chopsticks were useless to cut the chicken with).  I don't know why he couldn't just ask someone else to get them for me, it isn't often a customer comes and hunts you down, it usually means they are desperate for service! - He brought the silverware, and ran off, while our drinks were completely empty.  Had to wave him down again to get water refills. - The final straw was at then end.  He asked if we wanted anything else, and three times, I said the check please (anyone could tell at that point I was frustrated and ready to just leave).  He brought the check over (by then, my dad and son had left the restaurant, my husband was packing up my other son).  He then left for a LONG time.  I saw him on the other side of the restaurant just hanging out talking casually with a waitress.  I waited, and waited.  My husband left and I am now all alone at the table.  I get up and try to pay the hostess - can't.  She finally gets the waiter/manager.  But seriously - your a waiter/manager., your customer tells you three times to just bring the check, the table clears out with just one person left who is staring at you WAITING for to pay the bill --- Did I really have to go ask the hostess, and why couldn't the hostess cash me out?!?  There were 1000 other little things the whole evening that had me tearing my hair out.  In all, I will NEVER return with my family.  That being said, unless I find another sushi place in Anthem, the food is good enough to return to the sushi bar when my husband and I want a quiet night out and Grandpa can babysit the boys.

I'm a bit of a snob, I admit it. I generally prefer the full-service pamper me kind of salons that charge an arm and a leg. But times are tight - and I want my nails and my money.   Enter Biagio.   When you first walk into Biagio you would think you had walked into a fancy day spa. But when you read the prices, you wonder how they can stay in business. A "spa" pedicure, one of the most expensive treatments, is a whopping $49 (I say whopping with a sense of sarcasm). Not only do you get a great pedicure (best I've EVER received), but you get a leg and neck massage (yes the chairs are massage chairs, but real hands give you a real massage).   A "spa" manicure, which also comes with a neck massage, is $25.   The technicians are very nice, the store is immaculate, the tools are all sterilized, and the treatments are very high quality (even for a snob like me). Plus the atmosphere makes you feel like you are at a spa, not a strip-mall dive nail salon.   I highly recommend Biagio. I have been there several times, and plan to go back often.

11 years - that's how long I have been going to Fritz to get my hair cut, colored and styled.  I have followed him from salon to salon and now he is finally on his own in a suite of private stylists in Scottsdale.  In the decade plus I have been going to him, I have NEVER had to tell him what I wanted done with my hair.  Of course he asks everytime "What color today, honey?"  But I have always left the cut and color up to him, and I have NEVER been disappointed.  If you want perfection, go to Fritz.  For my wedding he spent no less than 5 hours making sure every detail was perfect for my big day.    For highlights, he usually uses 2-4 colors to make the color look as natural as possible with a shine that sparkles in the sun.  Without a doubt, I would highly recommend Fritz to be your stylist.  You won't regret it!

Last night was my first experience at Bluewater Grill - and I was very impressed.  One of the Managers is a real wine connoisseur and spent a great deal of time going over the whole wine menu with my husband and me.  He has great pride for the wines - as he has personally selected every one and has a number of "exclusives".  He helped us select a fabulous Italian red that was great for our meal!  To start we had the oysters on the half-shell, which were FABULOUS with fresh grated horseradish shaved on top of the cocktail sauce, which we blended in (I suppose some people may scrape it off, but I LOVE HORSERADISH).  I enjoyed the King Crab Legs, which were plentiful and delicious.  My only complaint is that there wasn't enough lemon, which I should have asked for more when I ordered them, since I know I use quite a bit.  The ONLY thing I didn't like was that there was no hot cloth to wash my hands with before or after the crab, and not even a wet wipe.  My husband had the scallops, which were served with a delicious spinach and mushroom sauce.  I didn't try them, but he raved about them.  We each opted for our own dessert.  I was hesitant because it was a list of all the typical desserts that are often pre-bought and just served.  But to my surprise, they make all of their desserts on premises.  I had the Key Lime Pie which was tart and scrumptious and my husband had the Chocolate Volcano.  David, the Manager who was so helpful, told us that on Sunday, Mondays, and Tuesdays they have 1/2 off bottles of wine - so I think we will be back on one of those days to try some of the ones he recommended that we weren't ready to "invest" in.

Get the pampering you deserve with a manicure from Bernadette at Guilty Pleasures Nail Salon.  I started going to Bernadette in 1999 and only stopped because she tried the corporate world for a few years and temporarily left the nail business.  I am happy to say she is back in the nail business and looking to build her book of business.  Competitively priced in a convenient location in downtown Scottsdale, Bernadette will take great care of you and your nails!  I highly recommend Bernadette and hope you will give her a try.  She has a full array of nail services, including Shellacking and acrylics.  For great looking nails, fabulous service, and someone who truly understands you and your nail needs - go see Bernadette!

Nearly 14 years - that's how long I have been going to Fritz to get my hair cut, colored and styled.  I have followed him from salon to salon and now he and his business partner Susan have their own salon - Hair Affair!  In the decade plus I have been going to Fritz, I have NEVER had to tell him what I wanted done with my hair.  Of course he asks every time "What color today, honey?"  But I have always left the cut and color up to him, and I have NEVER been disappointed.  If you want perfection, go to Fritz.

Never again.  Long strands of hair in my roll.  Sushi is usually made with bare hands...  If something as long and obvious as hair makes it in, what else is getting in the rolls?  Nope.  Not going back.
