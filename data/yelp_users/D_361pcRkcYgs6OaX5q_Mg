I have been in the invitation business for about 7 years and I owe much of my success to the Bridal Fashion Debut. It is the only show I currently choose to do, and it's twice a year. Their show has more attendees - and specifically brides - than any other show. I have clients come to me year round that say they saw me at the Bridal Fashion Debut bridal show. Shannon, Patti, Will and their staff are so friendly and knowledgeable, but they also set up their communication so that  you really don't even have to contact them to answer all your questions. (Like they email you the set up guide that has all the specs and timelines, or have both phone and email reminders of when deadlines are.) Their rates for a booth at a show is reasonable, and they also offer things like "bridal bag" where you can have your postcard inserted into the bag every bride gets when they walked in (a great feature since there are so many people to talk to and you often miss some!) If you want your wedding business to succeed, then you need to have a booth at this show!

We stopped using them. I am sure their printing is great, but their bindery (cutting, scoring,etc.) service stinks. One time they cut our invites (2 up) with one stack 1/4 inch shorter than the other. They didn't even bother to trim the stacks to match. Another time we had escort cards cut and scored. They messed up an about 1/3. When we took back in to fix, a guy with glasses was really rude about it. Then they threw away about 10 of the new ones we took in! (Like we wouldn't notice those were missing.) That was the last straw. We now go to FedEx Kinkos who does awesome work - and no attitude problems. If you do use Alphagraphics, ask for the woman that works there. She is nice and really knows the place.

The food is very good.  However, both their portion sizes and their customer service sucks.  Two times our to go order is wrong.  Either my vegetarian husband gets meat in his meal or I get tofu in mine and I wanted chicken.  Sick of constantly having it wrong - or having one dish get cold while we make a second trip to get the other corrected. Also,  noodle dishes don't even full half the box.   Staff is rude...won't do anything for the mistake.  If you order,  be sure to check everything before you leave!!

We found this place here on Yelp. It was date night and my hubby is a recent vegetarian. I wanted to take him somewhere he had choices. It was excellent! I had chicken tikka masala that I loved. The garlic naan is a must! We will definitely be back.

We use to come here for mainly bindery service (cuts, scoring) and also a few quick print jobs. I mainly worked with Dana, and she is a joy to work with! They were fast, reliable and always friendly. They knew me by name and how high my standards were. They always met them! The only reason I don't visit them anymore is because I moved to the other side of town. I HIGHLY recommend Dana and the staff here.

We started taking our prints here to get cut after finally getting fed up with Alphagraphics down the road.  They take their time and do it right - which is important to us since we create layered cards out of these pieces and sizing is really important! They are very friendly and fast too. The only reason not a perfect score is because one time they couldn't locate our job and we had to come back later when someone knew what was going on. (they had a communication break down.) Other than that, we are very happy and will be using them often.
