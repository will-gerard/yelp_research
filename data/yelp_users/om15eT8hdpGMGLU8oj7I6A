I've been to New Orleans and I've seen the kinds of people that purchase the special "go" cups from the alcoholic slushy vendors that line Bourbon Street. There assholes; all of them. There the same kinds of people we all know...the kind that never get invited back to parties that you throw. There that guy/girl that get their weeble on way too early in the night and end up spilling something that is red, blue or green in color all over your brand new, mostly white kicks. These people are 99% of the patrons of Fat Tuesdays' on Mill Avenue.  I had exactly one legitimate use for Fat Tuesdays in my life; my 21st birthday. During which I sucked down one of their god awful grain liquor concoctions, got brain freeze, bought random people atomic cherries, made out with a fat girl and projectile vomited a strange orange-brownish ichor all over the men's room shitter. Then I went to a sleazy strip club, which was money much better spent.  No respectable person, with the noted exception of celebrating their 21st birthday, should ever patronize this place. Based on a simple algebraic formula there technically shouldn't be enough 21st birthdays to keep this place in business. This vortex of suck has been around longer than any other bar on the Mill avenue strip (see: Casey Moore's is not on Mill) and is an anomaly that goes against the laws of time and space; Einstein is very upset. If you are a regular to this place and not some kind of being from an alternative universe or celebrating someone's 21stbirthday you are dead to me.  On a final note; if you are a being from an alternative universe please get in contact with me. I've got a few questions I'd like to ask you.

My wife love this bar so much we got married in it; true story.   We often times meet friends and loved ones just by saying, "we'll meet you at the bar".  Very quaint and relaxed, it is not a good place for say...a giant wedding party to try and sneak in an obviously underage person into as the staff will throw you all out, the cops will be called and your night will be utterly ruined by a cop wearing a Rick Grimes hat; also a true story.  This place is pretty cool; it fills up with posers on most Friday and Saturday nights so to truly experience the place try and off night just remember not to DB the place up or lest you feel the wrath of the angriest bartenders in the world; also a true story.  On a closing note, I actually invented the Tesla Coil and used it to time travel; true story ask anyone at Shady's. They know the score.

Not long ago I discovered I had a superpower; I'm invisible you see. I didn't know I was some sort of super being until I went to Monkey Pants. But right then and there, one faithful night my powers manifested and with a snap of your fingers I was invisible. Suddenly none of the bartenders at this place could see me.  No matter where I stood or how hard I smiled, tried to look friendly and make eye contact all of them stared right past me like I wasn't even there.  I didn't want to startle anyone so I didn't cry out, whistle or yell at any of the staff and seeing as how I was now invisible I was afraid that if I waved my arms or beckoned I might poke out the eye of an innocent bystander (with great power comes great responsibility don't you know). Besides I wouldn't do any of those things if I were a regular Joe customer visible for all to see; I use a thing called "bar etiquette" and disdain folks that are rude and do those sorts of things to any hard working bar staff. With visions of fighting crime and seeing bevies of naked women unseen and was gleefully giggling at my stroke of good fortune when another customer asked me what was so funny.   I was crushed. When the bus boy asked if I was finished with my drink I came to the sobering realization that my power of invisibility only worked on the bartending staff of Monkey pants; my new found superpowers had their limitations. When I stood too close to one of the regulars I was visible too and was eventually served.  I went back to the table on the smoking patio that my lovely companions and I had claimed and excitedly explained to my well dressed and attractive female companions of my new found powers (and their limitations) and was dumb struck to find out that they too had manifested the powers of invisibility as none of the wait staff could see them either. And sure enough no less than three waitresses passed by in less than ten minutes, our table void of drinks and none of them could see our pleading features.  In fact as the night dragged along the waitress seemed more interested in getting to their shifty drinks after work and even placing regulars at our table failed to garnish us any attention.  As last called neared there were so many people wearing monkey pants attire on the smoking patio it was hard to tell who was working and who was working on a buzz. Not that it mattered because we were still invisible you see.   Through-out the evening after sitting drink-less for dozens of minutes on end, my invisible friends and I had to stoop to standing next to regulars at the bar to be seen just to get a drink. There were a number of these patrons that I wished my superpowers worked on; especially the girl that decided to point out my jeans were riding a little too low by putting her finger in my ass crack. During one of my extremely long and patient waits at the bar I ended up getting tired (a side effect of being invisible perhaps?) and leaned on one of the stickiest bars I've ever come across. People were eating food here too which amazed me because there didn't seem to be soap or a way to dry your hands in the restrooms and I could only imagine how dirty those fingers were that they were licking nacho grease off of.   Our night ended without incident and we left, unseen by the staff of course.   An interesting post script is that apparently the burned out neon sign that adorns this place was the source of our collective super powers because we're not invisible to bar and wait staff anywhere else but Monkey Pants. But rest assured, dear reader, that the next time I want a place with a smoking patio where I can use my super power of invisibility you'll be sure to see me at Monkey Pants...or will you?

When I think of the East Valley these days three words spring to mind; tweakers, traffic and track housing. Long burned to cinders are my pleasant memories of the eastern suburban cities in which I spent my twenty-something's. Now all I see are endless lines of rush hour traffic full of terrible drivers rushing slowly to get home to housing developments where all the houses look the same and every block has at least one clandestine meth lab that goes unnoticed as long as the occupants keep the lawn in accordance with HOA rules. There are very few areas in the east valley that feature any unique buildings old enough to be built of something other than plywood and plastic polymers and those precious few areas that do have long been since given over to the individual towns poorer segments. Whereas the bright lights of Phoenix have churned slowly towards re-urbanization the East Valley has given way to suburban sprawl pushing the populace even beyond even the massive boundaries of Maricopa County.  The tiny island of Tempe aside I avoid interaction, travel and commiseration with 99.5% of all entities within the confines of the East Valley.  On the rare occasions I am forced to venture into these areas I treat them as a quarantine zone; hostile, unwelcoming and hazardous to my health. At any turn I expect to come across a roadblock of burned out vehicles being manned by caricatures from "Deliverance" eagerly waiting to rob me blind of all worldly possessions as well as my anal virginity. While I have long abandon these enclaves to battle amongst themselves I do still have allies and safe houses here; proverbial oases where I can seek safety and sanctuary.  O'Kelly's is not one of these places.   The analogy for this place, simply enough, is the Mos Eisley Cantina and when I walk into this place I'm one misstep away from some surly East Valley alien beating me to a pulp in the parking lot. I do, however, enjoy my time here as every time I come to this place I feel like I'm the Most Interesting Man In the World. Which is why, from time to time, I will stick my neck into this place that I don't quite belong to get a feel for how those inside the quarantine zone are faring these days.  This is not a bad bar; the bar staff and waitress almost to a woman are young, attractive and even if they don't truly mean it, they at least are self-aware enough to smile and flirt to get better tips. The Irish themed fair is surprisingly legit and I wouldn't dare drink in the place if they didn't have Dos Equis on special (Monday nights in case you were wondering).   The place is very spacious if not a bit low ceilinged with two separate rooms; one is your basic sports bar setup and the other has a fairly decent sized space for live music. Much to my surprise this is where O'Kelly's shines...if you're into the bands that grace the stage at O'Kelly's that is. There aren't any up and comers taking the stage on Friday and Saturday nights but I've personally heard a few good songs blaring from the stage side from time to time.    When I'm here and feeling like the most Interesting Man In the World I enjoy going to watch the people have stayed the course and to see reflections of what could have been. I very easily could have become trapped in this very same neighborhood as the high school I graduate from is only a few scant blocks away. I could have never bothered to embrace the microbrew craze and just drank some variation of Bud, Miller or Coors for the rest of my natural life.  I could have been content with the sameness any sports bar everywhere brings and never bothered to try crazy dance nights, quirky themed bars and never, ever set foot in a gay or lesbian bar ever. I could have grown bitter and so entrenched in my day to day doldrums that I flew into a rage anytime a new comer dared sit in "my special" seat. But I did or didn't do any or all of these things and as the Most Interesting Man In the World I've experienced and witnessed wondrous sights that most of the customers here have only seen through the flickering picture boxes gracing their living rooms. The reality that these folks could go out and live lives very different to those that they do now has never occurred to most of them. Occasionally I might regale some of the smokers on the patio on why I smoke American Spirits in the yellow box instead of Camel or Marlboro or the benefits or ordering a short cocktail compared to a tall one but for the most part remain silent and listen to the braggarts make outlandish boasts and the callow find enjoyment in the mundane.  But O'Kelly's still holds just enough hint of danger and more than enough strangeness to warrant a visit from time to time. For when I'm the Most Interesting Man In the World don't normally drink in the East Valley, but when I do I prefer to drink at O'Kelly's.

When I first heard of a brand-new, modern, sleek space opening within the confines of the central Phoenix corridor so many moons ago, I was ecstatic. Long had been the wait for new venues to manifest themselves mere striking distance from the recently completed Phoenix Light Rail system and Side Bar was one of the first. I was wooed by recanted stories of an impressive beer list, an ultra-sleek, modern space blended perfectly with the original building's architecture and bartenders that not only dressed the part, but actually were a cut above many of the denizens that couldn't make a decent cocktail if there life depended on it.  Once the soft opening was completed and the grand opening had come and gone, I went with a friend to check out this new homage to culinary cocktails and hipster heaven. As we navigated closer to our destination, a sense of foreboding began to set in. I shuddered mightily and broke out in unexplained cold sweats. The nearer we drew, the deeper the pit in my stomach became, until I found myself waiting at an all-too-familiar intersection.  My heart sank and my lips trembled with unbridled suffering as I stared straight in the face of a sign that read "Pei Wei Asian Diner." Choking back a sob, I found the old stand-by parking had been fenced off and I regrettably coasted into an empty parking space in the main lot. I lurched through the parking lot and brought my gaze to bear; there on the second floor of this classic intersection sat "Sidebar"...resting merrily on top of the corpse of my once beloved "Emerald Lounge."  Staggering in a blind rage, I found myself racing through the back alley and swung around street-side; gone it was all gone.  The door that had once blended so well with the battered faÃ§ade had been bricked up and along with the graffiti-covered fiber board mesh, the stenciled tag of Hunter S. Thompson with a badly drawn on pencil thin mustache had been permanently eradicated.  A flood of memories returned just then...  Flinging open the too-light door and being blinded by darkness at any given time; 1PM or 1AM it didn't matter. Emerald Lounge was the darkest and dingiest bar I've ever been in. It took scores of minutes for your eyes to adjust and all the while you were forced to stumble ungracefully while the bartender eyed you like some inbred moron. I always puzzled at, and never dared indulge in, the many mugs lining the bar for all the steadfast regulars; something about the hygiene of the place always made me avoid the drafts and suckle instead from glass or aluminum.  Seeing a local band here was one-part joy and one-part agony. Once you wound your way through the maze that was the internal guts of the place, you could get enticingly close to all you favorite local rockers...and listen to them play at ear splitting decibel levels in a room that made them sound like crap - no matter how good the sound guy or band actually was. And the puzzling inclusion of the place in the First Friday Art walk; up until then I had no idea there was actually art on the wall for sale - such was the black hole with the moniker "Emerald Lounge".  I sank to my knees and cast my face skyward muttering, "Why god, why?"...when a ghostly apparition appeared before me.  I blinked away the tears and focused heavily on the glowing figure, asking for guidance. My friend stepped from in front of the street light that had given me the false prophet glow looked down at me in bewilderment and stated simply, "Dude, Emerald has been closed for years; get up and let's get a drink."   And so we did.  The bathrooms were spectacular creations that belonged somewhere West of Drinkwater Blvd. The ambient lighting of the place actually let you see the person next to you that you were conversing with, and literally shed light on to the fact that the glassware had many custom pieces dependent on what you ordered.  While some of the furnishings were a little too kitschy for my taste, the space was well planned and set; especially well, considering how much of it there was to work with. And the crowd was a nice even mix of successful business types and scenesters with only an occasional overly-dressed-barfly to interrupt the ambiance.   It is now that I sit completely perplexed as to why in the hell I had kept a torch burning for so long for the Emerald Lounge when Sidebar is everything that I want in this day-and-age and it (Emerald) is so many things I don't.  I guess everyone needs a martyr to blame from time to time...so fuck you Sidebar for making the moments of my tweny-somethings such a wonderful trip down memory lane and for being a permanent marker and constant reminder at how change is inevitable and that the ghosts of the past can breathe life into new and wondrous adventures.

Toby Keith once made a song and accompanying video for "I Love this Bar". The songs chorus was a blatant rip off of the Crash Tests Dummies (mmm, mmm, mmm?!?) and I'm really surprised that all of Canada didn't protest and simultaneously sue him in turn for this blasphemy. The video was also a blatant rip off of my second favorite scene from "The Blues Brothers" movie (sorry but even Jake and Elwood can't hold a candle to Cab Calloway singing Mini the Moocher) where the boys end up playing (Rawhide anyone?) in a rural, run down country bar. Beyond knowing that he sings songs vaguely country music like in nature and that he was a very outspoken "Support our troops and America Fuck Yeah!" kind of guy that pandered to Middle Americans I don't know much about one Toby Keith. Don't get me wrong I do have a soft spot for a smattering of country crooners, but Toby doesn't really seem to be in the same league (or hemisphere really) as the likes of George Jones, Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson and the original Hank Williams.  The hap and circumstance as to why I and the better half ended up in "Toby Keith's I Love this Bar and Grill" are unimportant but we have forgiven...though I have not forgotten. If Toby Keith had any consulting help when he green lit and went forward with this idea the company that did so should be dissolved and the yes men that told him that the name was a fantastic idea should be drawn and quartered. The name is entirely too long and the place is such an abomination that the man should be embarrassed to have his name attached to it. The name is so long that I will not be referring to it as Toby Keith's I Love this Bar and Grill and because I'm so embarrassed for him having his named attached to it I don't want to call it just "Toby Keith's". I haven't thought of a suitable nickname yet but "Turd Bucket" has a nice ring to it.  The "bar" is nothing more than a tourist trap where everything is overpriced and comes complete with a full size store where you can buy all the Toby Keith's I Love this Bar and Grill merch your credit card can carry. The menu is uninspired, the contents of which you can find better quality at any BBQ or steak joint anywhere in the city. I've actually seen better looking steaks come off of an electric stove top. The actual physical bar is gigantic (I'm guessing like Texas, everything is bigger in Toby Keith's world) which leaves plenty of space for the bar staff to completely ignore you. And oh the staff...a collection assembled for their perceived physical attributes and not actual skill left us with a feeling that a fraternity and sorority were all given community service for the night. Back in the days when I had cable I saw an advertisement for a "plastic surgery nightmares" show of some kind; I'm guessing they filmed most of it here. The female staff should have skipped the awful boob jobs and botched collagen lip jobs and opted to join a gym to get rid of their muffin tops and flabby appendages. The guys should probably just chop their balls off now before all the steroids shrivel them up. While I normally appreciate places that have a decent beer selection and carry PBR tall boys, I can't stand places that over charge for tall boys of PBR; which of course this place does.  The only salvageable quality of the place is that it was located super close to a freeway making our escape that much easier.  Correction...there were actually a mentionable moment on the dance floor located in front of the stage which were both ridiculously proportioned as well. Here we watched a cowboy dressed in matching black leather pants, vest and cowboy hat (shirtless except for the vest of course) twirl his female counterpart at dizzying speeds to a tune only they could here. His attire actually only reminded me of a little place called "Charlie's" and how the black leather dancer would have been a hit any given night there. In fact Charlie's is actually a superior country theme bar in every conceivable facet; even offer line dancing and two step lessons for all us budding cow pokes. It also happens to be one of the best gay dance clubs I've ever been to in my entire life. Something tells me we won't be hearing a new hit single by Toby Keith about Charlie's anytime soon.  But if he does pen a country song about Charlie's I'd like to suggest that he just rips off one of his own songs...perhaps the chorus could be..."Mmm, mmm, mmm I love that..." Alas dear reader, the rooster is crowing and the pullet is trying to get out of its cage. You'll forgive this capon if he doesn't finish that last thought.
