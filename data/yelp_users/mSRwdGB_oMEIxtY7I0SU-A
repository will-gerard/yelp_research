If you're looking for a place where someone is going to treat you like they are doing you a favor answering a couple questions this is it.   I guess I just believe in the old school philosophy where the proprietor is suppose to treat the customer with respect and at least act like they are thankful for your business.    Came in looking for stuff to work on a project.  Since I guess I wasn't buying enough lumber to build a house they weren't too excited about helping me out, the guy at the counter acted like I had taken him away from his thanksgiving day dinner.    I prefer to keep my money at the mom and pop businesses even if it's a little more expensive,well that is until they make you feel like your business isn't important to them.

Great lunch spot hidden in a strip mall.  Everything I've eaten on the menu is great.  The owner is very personable and add to the authentic feel of this grocery store/ deli.

You guys have to be crazy!!!  The point system is ridiculous.  25 points for the lowest level bed, $16 for 25 points, was told the cheapest possible solution for me to get 7 visits on the cheapest bed would be $90!?!?  Are you serious??  Why would you make the lowest level bed 25 points?  This is marketing gone wrong. I called a competitor down the street, $25 for two weeks unlimited.  Rachel H. things sure have changed since your 5 star review.

I tried to get my oil changed on my lunch break, pulled up with one car being worked on and another in front of me.   I was walked in the office and asked to sit down.  I told the person at the customer service desk that I only had 45 mins for lunch and just wanted to drop the car off and come get it after work.  I was told that they would need to do paper work on me before I could leave.  I asked how long that would take and was told 15-20 mins.  When I expressed that I wouldn't have time to wait 20 mins just to give them my info he customer service rep told me that this is just the way they do things.  All I wanted to do was drop the car off?!? Can't imagine having to wait 15-20 just to get my info before they even started to do the oil change.  Ended up going down the street to Brake Masters and dropping it off the next day, took max of 1min to get my info.

Awesome, awesome, awesome!!! The food was wonderful, the staff was cool (maybe a little absent minded), great beer selection.  The only negative I can think of is it is small and kind of a pain to find, but defiantly worth it once you do.  There were so many things on the menu I still want to try.    The green fennel and veggie hash were both great, but the prize goes to the Jalapeño pecan pancakes.

Intriguing menu.  Ended up going with Cubano sandwich, chickpea wrap and cupcakes which were all awesome!  The service was friendly, cool décor.  I will defiantly be visiting again.

Called in to ask about a tune up, price, what they normally do in a tune up, etc.  Joel didn't want to talk to me on the phone and instead of answering my questions kept telling me to bring the bike in.  No thanks.  If you customer service is this rude on the phone, I'm not wasting me time bringing it up there to get the same treatment.

Owner is crazy, actually really like the food there (veggies that is), but won't ever go again.  I've never felt so uncomfortable or offended as I did the last time I visited this place.  I could write a book about this experance, but really is there a need?  Clearly I'm not the only one.  Owner was rude.

Not very impressed with our experience.  The cheese plate was just ok, a girlfriend got the cucumber soup which was wonderful, the main course was ok at best, for dessert I got a cheese fritter which was good.  Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca.  Our waitress was slow even for as busy as it was.  There was a time period I was without a drink for 20+ mins.  Cool setting just not really worth the price.

Awesome staff, great food.  Being from the south it's pretty hard to impress me with fried chicken, but the chicken and waffles here make my mouth water just thinking about them.   Kind of pricey, but if you're looking for good food, look no further.

Awesome, Awesome, Awesome bar!!!  Super chill, low key bar for real beer lovers.  I wish I lived closer to this place.  24 rotating tabs of legit beers.  First time I've found a sour on tap in AZ.  If you like craft beer this is a place for you.

Really cool unique place.  Warehouse turned in to a bar, clothing store, ice cream parlor with a boxing ring.  They have an awesome list of mixed drinks, that they do a wonderful job on.  This really is a cool place to go and I would suggest it to anyone as long as the temp is under 90 degrees as this place isn't equipped with A/C.  The only complaint I've ever had was the way they price their drinks.  The prices on the menu are pre-tax.... so instead of rounding up, each drink requires the bartender to calculate the change..... seems silly, but besides this small quirk it's a great place.

I can't stop eating here.  The prices are cheap, the service is friendly and the food is OUTSTANDING.   All of their sauces are good, try them all.  This is traditional street food with some extras on the menu.  My favorites are the fish tacos, quesadilla with carna asada.  Don't skip on the horchata, possible the best in the Valley.   Do not be afraid of the exterior, once that taco hits your taste buds you will forget all about it.

Gas Station with a legit restaurant.  Being from Texas, I'm pretty critical of BBQ.  This place passes the test.  The breakfast taco's are my favorite.  Really impressed with the habanero sauce.  .

Horrible customer service.  Called in an order, had to give them my CC info over the phone just to place the order so if you're paying cash don't even waste your time.  Was told it would be ready in 20 mins, got a call from a number in North LA, didn't answer, checked my vm which I normally don't so quickly, it was the habit burger processing dept saying that my payment went didn't go through, called them back and was told my card info did't go through and my order cancelled.  If I wanted to place the order again it would take another 20 mins.  I said out of frustration this is kinda silly why can't I just pay when I get there, it's not my fault the girl who took the order entered my card info incorrectly, the CS rep responded actually the card was declined not entered incorrectly.  I told her thanks for her help and went to 5th ave Cafe for a couple burgers.  And yes I used the card that was "declined"  to pay for them.  PS. parking is a madhouse and not worth the hassle at this location, but honestly end the end who wants to spend their hard earned money at a place where they treat you poorly.

Glad to see a small brewery open up in Scottsdale.  Food is great, beers are good if you like hoppy, the brewer seems to have a very heavy hop hand.  A couple taps dedicated to other local brews.  Very friendly staff.  Really glad to see this place open.

Came to try for the first time, be aware they close at 9:00 not 10:00 like they have advertised here on Yelp.  Of course I get here and they are locked up.   This is obviously frustrating, guess I'll just stop by fry's and make my own salad.

Changed times of operation, drove there to find it not open, call a head so you don't end up like us.
