People here have a passion for customer service and they watch every single little detail. The resort has incredible desert views. It is awesome to spend a night or two at this beautiful property,  this os the perfect staycation! Even our cat received a welcome amenity!

Very disappointed that they forgot to bring the dip I ordered, it was a special one they have on the menu, when I pointed that out to the server, he just said they did not charge me for it, but he did not even apologize. Also the burger we ordered was supposed to have bacon and they forgot that too, the manager took off $1.50 from our bill. Definitely NOT coming back!

I really want to come back to this place, but maybe stay at the hotel. We tried Brunch, hostess was very nice and sat us were we preferred, it was early so we had plenty of options, chose the best of both worlds, near the patio but inside so we could enjoy the AC but have a nice view. Menu was interesting, food was delicious. Server was very nice, gave us suggestions and our food was brought promptly. Alcoholic beverages were a bit pricey... I definitely want to come back and I'll use the free guaca mole that I got for checking in with yelp.  :)
