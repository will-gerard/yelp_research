Absolutely ridiculous customer service. I have a U-Line beverage and ice maker unit that was under factory warranty in need of a covered repair service The Mfg website refers G And A under their list of authorized service providers. While they came out to diagnose my unit when it came down to fixing the unit they phoned me to decline the repair. I asked them why and Jerry  (owner) said because "I won't make any money." U line will only cover my costs and expenses  there isn't any profit for us" While I understand businesses want to earn a profit sometimes there are instances where you will just break even for that particular job and you hope to keep good customer rapport and goodwill. I guess that is too much to ask. DONT GIVE THEM ANY BUSINESS. THEY WILL NEVER GET MINE!!!

Celebrated my last birthday of my 40's and also our good friends 10 year anniversary. CeCe and Monica made our experience on point... The food incredible, we started with the cheese plate and the bacon and scallop appetizers... So AMAZING. Of course we all had steaks and seafood... But more than the food, the service was impeccable... I have been to many fine dining establishments, but this location and staff are seriously the BEST.

Great service always friendly. Have been several times even on opening day which was a zoo. Probably because Verrado has been starving (literally) for great coffee. The other place served the equivalent of Sanka. So happy you can now get a great drink on the way out and on the way back in. The quick grab and go food is amazing great price and flavorful. The Peanut Butter chocolate bacon (sounds weird)  donut is not to be missed. Trust me a party for your tastebuds.
