I was excited to stay in a four star hotel in downtown. The location of the Omni was excellent. It was near all the shopping and restaurants. The room itself was covered in flora and looked like it had not been updated since the 60's. The only saving grace was the beds were very comfortable.  I do not recommend ordering room service. I know room service is expensive, but I got eggs Benedict, 2 waters, 2 coke, and orange juice and my bill was $70. I am okay with paying higher prices but that was just ridiculous. We also had to pay $40 for valet parking. And to top it off the internet was $9.95 per day per device.

My husband and I go here often. The service is good and the food is always cooked properly. It is never outstanding but you can always assure you will have a well cooked meal with flavor.

I have been in Montreal for two weeks and been here twice. It is by far the best Lebanese food I have had. I am not a fan of ordering chicken at restaurants because it always comes out dry, but there chicken skewers are moist and full of flavor. I like tabbouleh somewhat, but here I eat an entire bowl.

I had many friends suggestion this place and I am so glad they did. The building is a small old home that has been converted and doesn't seat many so be sure to make reservations ahead of time.  All the proportions were very small, but with each bite my mouth was filled with an amazing textures combination along with some unique pairs. We had big eye tuna titaki but instead of traditional ponzu sauce they used a red beet puree with a balsamic reduction. simply breath taking. The favorite of the table was the Grapefruit & Hamachi with avocado, white truffle ponzu oilhimatiche. It was served on a spoon and easy to take in one bite. All the textures and truffle to a hint a spicy made this dish very complex. After every course all of us girls had to regain our composure because the food was so wonderful it actual gave us goose bumps at times.  I look forward to a trip back out to Phoenix soon and this place will defiantly have my repeat business again!!
