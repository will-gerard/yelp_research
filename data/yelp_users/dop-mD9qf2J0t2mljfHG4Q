I was lured to this place by their website - what a mistake.   Here's why.  The website says "access from all freeways" and "close to the airport".   In reality this place is a couple miles off any freeway and tucked back in a sketchy industrial area.  It may be close to the runway but that doesn't matter because the route the shuttles have to take to actually go to the airport is probably a further drive than from any of the other lots.   The website says "security fenced".  Yes - there is an old chain link fence, and it's falling down!  Literally - falling down in places.  I am not joking when I say it would be super easy for almost anyone to jump over it in places - and I wouldn't be surprised if this happens considering the sketchy area.  The website says "asphalt surface with wider isles and stalls".  Yes - there is asphalt, which was probably laid 20 years ago, has never been maintained and is a mine field of potholes.  Wider isles and stalls is not even a joke, it's just a lie.  In fact, some of the isles are barely wide enough for one car and the spaces seem like compact spaces.  What they also don't tell you on the website is the vans are old, the whole place is old, and sometimes you can get stuck behind a train (yes...stuck behind a train) when the shuttle is taking you to the airport.  Needless to say, I won't be back
