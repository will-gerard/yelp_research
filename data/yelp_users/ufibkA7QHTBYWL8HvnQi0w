We came on a Monday, plenty of places to sit inside and out. Short wait for the food and Coffee Shop next door. My meat scramble was okay and my husband loved the apple smoked bacon. Will come back, great place to bring kids and out-of-towners.

Nice little eat-in or take-out restaurant. Order up front then have a seat or take to-go. Bean and cheese burrito is amazing, comes with yummy spicy chipotle sauce. Homemade tortillas yum. I had the shrimp cocktail it was yummy although a couple shrimp were mushy. I ordered chips and salsa but didn't receive it. Checked my receipt and didn't pay for it either. So either they forgot or I was supposed to grab free chips and salsa at the bar on the way out. Hey, it was my first time! Will return for my future lunch breaks.

Nice intimate place, 30s and up. We sat in the bar area which was cozy. They have a nice outdoor area as well. Salad and baked shrimp were okay, but the drinks were great and the roast beef and filet were excellent. Our waitress Nikki was great and even brought up complimentary champagne for our anniversary. Will return.

I walked into the store right when it opened to buy the dreaded yearly bra. She stopped me to ask what I was looking for, and I rolled my eyes when she asked me if I knew my size? Of course I know my size. She whipped her measuring tape out and said hmm I think you might be a different size and took me to the dressing room where they had bras ready to try on for sizing. I'm so glad this happened because I was wayy more comfortable in a bigger cup size and would have just bought the same size and been uncomfortable for another year. I ended up buying 3! Thank you, Stella, for taking the time when I didn't even ask for it. And for helping despite my exasperation. And thanks for VS for making the process easy and comfortable and quick!

Waitress Nicole is awesome! I have asked for a caramel shake each time I have come here only to be told it's seasonal..and she doesn't hesitate to make me one "in the back". Great service and my kids like the grilled cheese and fries

The food is almost always great, and our lunch today was really good. My husband had the bacon avocado grilled cheese and enjoyed it. I had the Caesar with sirloin and it was yummy! We sat at the bar and the service was slow, but she was busy. Get the member card so you can get rewards and free desserts!

Man, Starbucks baristas don't say "hi, how are you today?" anymore in the drive thru?? It's funny because I like to tip with my Starbucks app, but my only tip for this place is to hire people that actually want to work there! PS you're lucky if they get your drink right.
