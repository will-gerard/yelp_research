Light dinner before a concert consisted of some bruschetta, a side of fries and 4 glasses of wine. Live  music added a great vibe but realized a price jump from happy hour to regular prices. Still great, just catch that happy hour to get the best bang for the buck!

Had an item that was purchased for my kids and just over the 60 day return policy that was defective.The manager was understanding and exchanged the item for the same item. Despite being a chain, the important part is that they realized that my business to them was important on a local level.

As a frequent favorite for breakfast, this place provides my family, friends and outer-towners a solid variety of options at a good value.   I must admit, the menu change has thrown me for a curve as I was a big fan of the $1 menu to add-on as needed to my meal, but service & food are on point. The 'to-go' beverage you had with your meal to go is an added bonus along with the punch card to entice another visit.  I'm a simple guy so the traditional breakfast works for me with some side whole wheat pancakes! I splurge on the most expensive entree when my card is stamped up :-)

I'm not a big fan of the menu that has 1000 things but I know people like it so I will keep my review unbiased. The choices are overwhelming but the one thing I'm not a fan of is you can't 'tweak' you food items. Can't add more garlic remove some key items as a lot of things are pre-packaged, in particular the sauces. About the only thing I could add was salt or pepper. Staff was good and I enjoy the variety of bread, but the wait was a killer.   Would I return, probably of requested by someone but keep to something simple.

Undecided as usual for lunch so when in doubt, a chain restaurant with lots of variety helps me. Like Cheesecake Factory, a lot of menu items which can be overwhelming. Had a great server to help me navigate and provided some good conversation as I was solo! Location and menu items suited for a large or small group and accommodating.

Big fan of the wings and atmosphere to be honest. TV's all around with a sport on to keep you entertained. Help yourself to plenty of peanuts and just swipe the shells onto the floor. The kids dig the kids meals which are priced reasonable and include a good variety from pasta, burgers, hot dogs, fruit, veggies and or fries. A few video games to keep them busy and of course the cookie desert is a family share.   They have daily specials for food and happy hour, Baja Wednesday they have house & flavored margaritas along with Mexican imports all for under $4 and Four Peaks Friday is exactly what it is...

Good pizza and the lunch special with a drink & salad for $10.50 is great... Personal pizza seemed a bit smaller than before but still good. House Made dressing is great!

Old school diner that is still on point. Anything Mexican will have some kick to it so if you like spicy then make sure you try the Eggs Maximilian with Chorizo... Service is quick when you come as a small group (4-6 people). I tend to stick to traditional breakfast items but always end up eating something else. I like this place as its keep to it's core without having to expand and appeal to the masses. For those not wanting the chain breakfast restaurants, a good place to come. For others, step outside of the box just a bit and give it a shot.

Wanted to try another locally owned place in my neighborhood and I see this place every time I leave Target across the street!!! Todays urge on my mind was soup and this place didn't disappoint. Checked out the reviews from Yelp and lots of positives. Don't let the exterior or location fool you... Had 2 soups and the house chicken... It was served hot and prompt and exceeded my expectations... In short, I'm coming back as the soups looked amazing on other tables and from the menu!

Food quality/taste was consistent and fresh from the burger, to the mixed fries, even down to the mixed drinks. Atmosphere was lively, but would luv to see that carry over to the staff. The personal connect with a servers can makes the experience all the best.

Patio area and food is the big draw for me. They got a corn hole area outside which is perfect to entertain both adults & kids. Service staff can be hit/miss but will admit on this day they were accommodating. Our group has the fish tacos, chi, guac & salsa, Vig Azz burger, Posole, sliders & mac n cheese.

After hour work gathering for a good friend but the service was very slow for everyone. In particular I requested a food menu (to order food) but once I got the menu it took some 20 mins later before I was asked if I wanted something. That was lost money as I clearly pushed an issue for the menu expressing my hunger. The atmosphere was good, just didn't have a good service experience. I would still go back.

Been coming for a while and the staff works to get you set for the road with confidence ... From checking air pressures, tire repair or new tires, u get a good honest explanation and what I consider competitive prices.   I gave 4 stars only because they need to have Wifi available for waiting customers. They are good & quick but it would help for those trying to connect for work.

Needed a break from the norm and wanted to catch the last half of the NCAA game... Had the Monaco Focaccia... The side of sweet jalapeno dressing didn't really move me but what better way to indulge then a half/half side of fries/onion rings.

The customer service has always been good but I have a concern with the 'quantity or proportions when it comes to the food.  Ordered a regular size plate of honey seared chicken along with a kids meal and when it was brought to our table, I wondered who's was who's... Same reoccurring issue, a plate (or a bowl when it comes to the kids meal) full of rice with very little protein. Disappointing as we really did like chain. Lettuce wraps didn't really have a good flavor either.

I come with my coworker every other week as we are creatures of habit. Unfortunately our last experience didn't start off so great as we found ourself arriving before the lunch crowd, but one of the last ones to get served. The good thing is the manager recognized the situation before we escalated in frustration and explained what happen regarding the delay (new cooks). They valued us and that was important... Along with a gift card to return... Been back twice since and still plan to return.

One of my favorite places to grab lunch in the neighborhood (work & home). Today it was Gyro & fries. Shawarma is equally as good! I've been coming her for years and the owner makes everyone feel welcomed & goes out of his way to make sure u have a good experience. Thanx Edgar!

Good place for breakfast and when I don't know what I want for lunch, I typically look here so I can extend my breakfast. Still trying to get through the new menu, but stick with the traditional breakfast and a small side of pancakes... Which use to be from the dollar menu, now it's the $2 menu... That part I'm not a fan of.

Early Saturday morning meal needed before the crowds kicked in. I come here often. I'm just picking with my food being served correctly and in a particular order. But that's just me (I like my waffle cooked well & want to eat that 1st vs the other stuff). Staff is always friendly and I know what I'm getting.

Today my family had what I would consider the worse experience one could imagine when it comes to eating a meal, there was a large bug in my wife's Fugi Apple Chicken salad. On site she talked with an associate and he only refunded the salad... After leaving I shortly called and spoke with a manager and the entire meal was reimbursed on the card (which it should of been the 1st time without question!!). Not sure we will return back to any Paradise Bakery given the poor handling of food to remove bugs or any related items from a salad and lack of how they will be addressing going forward to ensure no one experiences the same thing!   Simply disappointed with the entire experience & now we have 1 less 'healthy alternative' when it comes to dinning out!

How can offer Apple Pay in the restaurant and drive thru but when I come thru the drive thru in the one explaining to the employees how it works and what the scanner loos like. After all that, the scanner doesn't come close to the drive thru window.... c'mon man!!! And the attendants response was, I don't know what to tell you... FAIL

I continue to explore local restaurants in my neighborhood and again, I'm very happy with another great find. Mark's Cafe food & service is great... Be careful when you ask for Pancakes as they are HUGE!!! Order just 1 or get the special and split with a friend. Also had the California Eggs Benedict and the potatoes were really good! This place is now officially added to breakfast options for the family!

Large party for dinner with friends (just make sure to call ahead) but it worked out great. Despite being a growing chain this spot makes you feel like it's it own mom and pop restaurant. The Milano mule is one my fav drinks.  Had the bruschetta to start & followed up with The Pig Pizza as my main course. Pizza was good but need some more flavoring to the sauce and maybe some oregano to give it that pop. Only downside, the AC was pumpin so hard everyone was cold and I think it cooled off my pizza before I could get half way thru it. Would still return!

Good food and staff. I had the Brisket & Pulled pork with a side of Fries & fruit. Also came with some sliced pickles and texas toast. Good experience and it lived up to my friends recommendation. I'm not always on that side of town, but I could see making it a frequent place to visit as the food and BBQ sauce options were all good.

new location, same horrible service!! they just can't get it right!!! Food was sub par because it took so long to get quality service. They go hand in hand. I had to politely remind the staff that there were 4 tables sitting outside still waiting to get greeted. After the poor service & messed up meals, I told the manager the problems and he worked to correct them & was grateful that I said something to him, but u would think it would get better... Nadda even worse! Disappointing experience for myself & son (who is 3). At one point, my son asked to go next door to RA as he was just bored sitting and waiting for juice, ketchup, & his dessert.

Going to college in Tallahassee, the one spot that was a winner for everyone was "Guthrie's of Tallahassee"... Same style menu & the staple of a college meal here at Raising Cane's. Even more fitting that it's near ASU Campus. Chicken Fingers, Fries, Texas Toast & coleslaw (swap-able). Granted, it's a chain with locations globally I believe, but it still provides that same level of comfort I had back in school... A simple and great tasting meal!!!  Its a basic concept & they keep it simple. They sell chicken tenders and that's what I like about them. Expanding the menu to do "too much" would take away from things, so hopefully they keep it simple. If ur a dipping person like me, order an extra sauce or exchange the coleslaw for another item like toast!

Great option for breakfast/brunch in the DC Ranch area. Lots of great options to appeal to the picky or selective eater. One of the few places in north Scottsdale, so come the weekends, it can get busy with a good wait. Suggestion, use that time to get some family & friend pictures on the property as its a popular spot for photographers!

Surprisingly great overall atmosphere for the family. Could use some other interactive activities for sibling or parents while waiting. Plenty of TVs, but need to spread the selection around? Not everything with ice is fun to watch (hockey, ice skating)... I get it, but some baseball or tennis needed to be on.

I keep coming back for the Rocky Shores donuts (gotta do at least 4) and then I just fill up dozen by adding whatever my mood is.   Would recommend to get a variety as it's not like a box of chocolate and everything is a surprise, with these donuts you know what you are getting.

I'm a fan of the lunch menu portions and value & everyone here is friendly and accommodating. I have a few other places as a top pick when it comes to Asian dining but I've been happy with everything on the menu. Typically everything for me is for Pickup & I like how they setup the plastic bags for easy opening or how the sushi items comes with a small pack of ice. I'm not a fan of the plastic utensils when dining in. When I sit at a restaurant, I like to have hardware

Location is nice but call ahead during the weekend for dinner as it can get packed quickly with groups & when your enjoying a crab/crawfish cookout, it will take some time to turn tables.   We had about 5lbs of Dungeness crab (2), a half pound of shrimp & added sausage to both. The flavorings are good with one being a bit too spicy then expected. Also had an order of Etouffee (which was excellent) that I would highly recommend.  Staff works well to help each other with radios so if you need something, they will get it for you promptly. Order some beers from tap and via the bottle and would of liked them colder, but still a good experience. Would recommend for locals and guest coming to town as a group outing.

We've been looking for an alternative solution to our bed without going overboard and dealing with the hassles of mattress stores or heavy markups. Decided to get up close and personal with the foam mattress and ask all the questions.   Store staff is friendly and informative. Kinda hard to really get an unbiased opinion to a certain extent, but the experience was good. If you go on the weekends, your wait time could be up to 1 hour as the goal is to have a personalized experience. We felt a bit rushed but I have to admit I was a bit slower in putting my questions out (and I had many).

I'm not a big buffet person but when comes to Indian food, I like them as it gives me an opportunity to taste and try different foods. They had a wide variety of foods to accommodate our lunch group including the vegetarians and its priced reasonable. & the customer service was good. Would definitely come back during dinner service

Like I said, when I want something, I know what I want!! Good all the way around... Nice crisp with my chicken and moist, waffle was hot with a bit of a crunch on the edge... And the cold coke in the mason jar hit the spot... Looking forward to coming back with live jazz on the menu in the evenings...  Came back in less than 24hrs with my family & the same thing applies that I said yesterday. The tacos were added and my son enjoyed!!

Managed to catch the truck at our neighborhood farmers market early Saturday morning and the lobster tacos were great. Had 2 orders followed with a bowl of lobster bisque. Food was spot on... Some items were a bit pricey, but it ain't chicken, it's lobster people... In Arizona... enjoy, as I did!

Make sure your read my review in its entirety... Here's my biggest complaint... How can you call yourself Angry Crab, yet every time I come to an Angry Crab, you have no Dungeness Crabs??? The name says Crab, then you should have some crab on hand!!!! I could understand if it was late in the evening but less than 2 hours of being open you ain't got no Crab??? c'mon man!!!...  I shared the same exact comments with our server and then later when the manager came by to check on how we were enjoying the meal. I jokingly told him 'great, if I had some crab'. This guy recognized my sarcasm, embraced it & rolled with it. Most importantly, he was genuine when he said if I could get it for you, I would!!! That went a long way with us...  The size & layout of this location I like & the bonus here is that they serve bbq & make fresh pizzas. We ordered the ribs and brisket, with the beans & coleslaw. Also had the kids fried shrimp & fries, along with 2lbs of shrimp. Meal, service and atmosphere was good and I appreciated the way the manger talked with me when I shared my frustration of no Dungeness but yet it was on special (as a mixed bag, not whole crab)...    Will I go back, absolutely... But I plan to call ahead to make sure my crab is available as that's why I go often :-)
