This Denny's is dirty and hit or miss on the service.  Really needs a remodel and new management.  I dont expect a lot from Denny's in the first place so...

I just love Joe's.  Service isn't always perfect but the food is.  Spicey Dungeness Crap Pot and a cold Bud Light. MMM, I am in heaven.  It does get busy so be prepared to wait on Friday and Saturday nights.

This is the place to go for your paintball equipment needs. Julie is extremely knowledgeable and gives great advise. Their prices are very competitive.
