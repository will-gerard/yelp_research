#104 I arrived at the Fireside Grill after a really HOT day in Arizona last May (yes, it took me a bit to post my review).  I was looking for something refreshing and comforting to relieve me from this tough, hot, steamy day.  A friend suggested the Fireside Grill in Fountain Hills.  Sounds great.  We entered the place and the bartender/manager Louis greeted us in a super friendly manner, welcoming my group to the establishment.  We took a seat at the open bar area and began watching TV--they were showing the Baltimore situation as it unfolded.  Louis asked me what would I like to drink as I looked over the menu.  I ordered a drink and began to ask Louis about the menu.  He offered several suggestions; however, I (and my companions) decided on a few items:  The Southwest Chicken Salad The Cobb Salad The Pasta and Meatballs  The Southwest Chicken Salad was incredible.  It was served in a toasted tortilla bowl with beans, tomatoes, jalapenos, olives, avocado, and sour cream, guacamole and salsa on the side.  The Cobb salad was good, not amazing.  This salad was replete with tiny chunks of turkey, bacon, thinly sliced egg, fresh blue cheese and whatever dressing we chose.  It was a large portion, but kinda boring.  Finally, we had the penne pasta and meatballs with marinara sauce.  This pasta dish came with garlic bread layered with melted cheese and a small side salad.    The place is clean, and open, looking out onto a pool and the valley.  Live music was preset with a singer.  Many regular guests were there as Louis knowingly greeted several customers as they arrived.  The service from Louis was impeccable.  He was attentive, friendly and informative.

#106 After trying a few other spots in town with no luck, we ended up at Katana Sushi & Grill.  I am glad we did.  I love sushi and am always looking for great sushi and have no problem that our previous dinner plans fell through.  We arrived at what appeared to be "closing time" but this did not seem to phase the manger/owner of the establishment, as he warmly greeted our party and welcomed us to his sushi house.  We loved the atmosphere.  It was beautifully decorated, very authentic with lovely Japanese music playing softly in the background.  The place seemed spacious, even though it was small--great decorator to supply that open feeling while being in such a small space.   The menu was what you would expect at a sushi place with all the usual staples.  There were a few "special" offerings wherein you could order a larger portion of items or add small sides to your sushi choices, which was nice.  We always like to color outside the lines ;)  After ordering and then enjoying about 10 rolls, some sashimi and nigiri we were about full.  We were staying in a hotel in the area so I really did not want to take sushi to go, but my partner did...so, anyway...   I really loved the staff, the service and the freshness of the sushi.  If I am ever in Arizona again I will definitely try Katana Sushi & Grill again.  Stephani Smiles for Katana Sushi & Grill ;)

#105 I stayed here on a spring trip to Arizona.    The staff was nice enough when I checked in and showed me the hotel's amenities while offering extra towels for swimming or jacuzzi visits.    On the first floor there was a bar, a restaurant, a large bean shaped pool, a big fire place sitting area (I have no idea why you would need a fire place in Arizona, but it was nice), and tons of other stuff like a little store for small items.    Once I arrived at my room I immediately put my things down and went into the bathroom.  When I flushed the toilet, or tried to flush, there was this loud noise, and loud pipes that really sounded stressed.  I called the front desk and asked to move.  They gave me a new room with the same problem--probably because the room was right next door and shared piping with the last room.  I finally received another room further away and this one was fine.  I was tired after traveling, then swimming to relax in the overly hot Arizona sunshine do I opted out of dinner and ordered room service.  The menu was decent and there were several large salad options.  I asked for salt to be delivered and extra ice with the meal.  Well, the guy came with no salt, meat on my salad and no ice ;(  I asked him to return with those items, please, and he assured me he would.  When he returned with the correct food he forgot the salt.  I cannot eat without salt, yes, it is an addiction--no reason to judge.  Anyway, I felt as if I were asking him too much to ask him if he would return with the salt, but I asked anyway.  He sighed, shrugged his shoulders and said, "Yeah, I guess I'll go AGAIN."  Wow--Ooooooook.  Once my salad was nice and room temperature he returned and asked, "Anything else?"  Nope, I am good, thanks.  I will say the bed was comfy with tons of pillows.  Plenty of TV options, sift towels and decent air conditioning.  The people at the front desk were very helpful the next day when I asked for information on shopping.    My sub-par rating is really for the room service.  Incorrect order, bad delivery guy, poor attitude.  The rest of my stay was adequate.   Stephani Tries to Smile for the Lexington Hotel : -/
