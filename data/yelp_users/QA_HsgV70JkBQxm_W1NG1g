These guys were great! I called Monday morning and they were able to squeeze me in that morning! Fixed my broken drips in about an hour and were on their way. Fantastic customer service! Definitely recommend them!

After moving away from Phoenix a few years ago I finally had the chance to revisit for business travel. I knew exactly what stops I wanted to make while I was there and Keegan's, hit the top of that list! A girlfriend of mine was able to meet me for lunch and as we walked in the door I was blown away by the recent renovations they went through, the place looks awesome! Although the place was different looking I was still greeted by some of the same employees that I remember! Ramsey, the manager was working and he also made a stop of at our table to say hello (this is the kind of service Keegan's is known for) friendly, energetic people who are always smiling.   For lunch I had the Cobb salad; chicken, hard boiled egg, smoked gouda cheese, bleu cheese, bacon and avocado with your choice of dressing (and if you ask they will toss it for you)....seriously so good... heaven in my mouth!! My friend got the Taproom Steak Sandwich, perfectly cooked to her liking and she said it was awesome! And since I was on vacation (well sorta!) we decided to wash our delicious meals down with one of Keegan's famous Mud Pies!! YUMMY!!  I wish I still lived close, I'd visit Keegan's every week if I could. I should be traveling to Phoenix again soon and when I do I will definetly be stopping in again!

I was really excited to try this place out because I had heard such great things. My husband and I decided to pick this place for our date night a few Saturdays ago. We arrived at about 5:50 (10 minutes before Happy Hour ended) We thought we would order a glass of wine each and a brushetta board before HH wrapped up and then order off the menu. We sat until 6:08 before someone finally greeted us. It was super awkward too because every server kept looking at us and making eye contact but no one ever cared to come by and get a drink order. Finally greeted,  I asked the waitress if we could order a few items from the HH menu because we sat down prior to it ending - she acted as if I was asking for too much "Ummmm I can't access those buttons after 6pm I'll see if that's even possible" as if I was in the wrong for asking! Our brushetta came out promptly however, it was much less in taste then I expected. They only had 4 selections and you picked 3 to complete your board - not much variety. The tomatoes were slimy to the point I had to undress each piece just to stomach it. Wasn't pleased. I ordered the prosciutto and brie flatbread and my husband had the salmon cakes - both were good.   I most likely will not return to this place due to the lacking service and experience and the food being just OK. Hopefully I was there on an off night.

My phone went for a swim yesterday. It was barely working when I took it in figured I was going to be spending $650 on a new iPhone replacement. Much to my surprise they were able to wipe out the motherboard and fix it completely! And the bonus it only took 4 hours. They told me if they weren't able to repair it they wouldn't charge for it, which made it completely worth a shot! $49 later I walked out the door with my phone as good as new! HIGHLY recommend!!
