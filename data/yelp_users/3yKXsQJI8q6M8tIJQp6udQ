This business is really a hidden gem.  The owners are great people and role models in my opinion. The atmosphere is whimsical and enlightening. Now the food, drinks, and desserts are amazing. If your in downtown Mesa, meet with a friend or two.

Just in the area dropping off a friend for a graduation event. Stopped in for a spinach and mushroom slice. The other Rays Pizza I went to before had fresh mushrooms and spinach. This place used canned mushroom and spinach.  My pie was cold at some points and luke warm on others. They used the pizza that looked to be sitting there for an hour. +.  Not only was it $9 for both slices, the service was like 5/10.  I was the first to say hello out of the 4-7 employees on shift. Wall art and murals are enticing. I was going to ask for a refund but I didn't want to waste and have another trash can eat better than 50 percent of the worlds population. I'd say just go to the gas station and grab a burrito next time.

Front my initial phone call of making an appointment to leaving after the imaging, great service. Very polite and efficient.  The chair for the MRI was like something from Star Wars. Your typical amount of time for an MRI. The medical imagist was polite, quick, and seemed happy to be at work.  He is one of the few to understand that.

Everyone was pleasant except Dr. Arash Araghi.  From the lady that checked me in to the x ray technologist to the his assistant Molly provided excellent service and we all chatted and built that base rapport. Then Dr. A comes in the office like someone just did a number to him when I'm the one already in excruciating pain. I'm not feeling confident that he will be the best surgeon for me, or anyone for that matter. His bedside manner left me feeling uncomfortable and not wanting to return. I wish it was not so for I just don't want to be in pain anymore.  He had the images from my American Dynamic imaging but wanted me to get them trying to teach me some sort of lesson.
