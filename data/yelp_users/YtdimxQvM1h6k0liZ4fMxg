This is a hidden gem in the heart of  ASU that I think anyone or everyone should try, when in the area.  Undeniable IndoPaki food that would melt your heart,  save you money and satisfy your craving for exotic foods. I have visited this place repeatedly with family, love one and friends.   So the next time you think Indian food, come check it out! I assure you, you won't be disappointed.

Iam just astonished and very delighted.  I have no other words for their hospitality, outstanding and very authentic food and intracultural setting.  Im inlove with this hidden gem in tempe. I have had very good friends from Dubai visit and they loved it. This is a MUST to come and visit. Their food quality is Halal and it was soo good that it reminded me of the authentic flavors of home(U.A.E).  Thank you to the staff for a great warm welcome and very fulfilling hospitality.

If you're starving and up for a big meal but want to eat in style.  This sushi restaurant is the place to be.  You have a few selections of appetizers, lunch, dinner entrees  and dessert.   But the real reason why you really want to come here is for their all you can eat sushi.  They have a wide and very delicious selection of nigiri and sushi rolls. They also have happy hour. When your here at this place is comfortable and feels homie.   I Love this resraurant that much that I've  been here soo many times to satisfy my sushi cravings. Matter of fact this would be my 5th year coming and going to Midooooo!!

Today was my first visit and I was Wowed by this place.   As soon as you step foot and lay eyes in there, first thing you notice is the modern with yet a traditional touch to the restaurant.  This place had ambience and the true definition of lounge.  The staff are attentive. We tried and ordered a few things on the menu and Jane no complaints at all. The quality was fresh and the quantity was just right.    I definitely would make this my one stop shop for sushi and happy hour.sakebomb. Com!

This place is a hidden gem in Mesa.  It has a very homie feel, it is a family oriented place and the service is definitely on fleek(meaning they have fast service). Back yard Tacos definitely are one of those mom and pop shops or hole in the wall kind of places. This spot should be on the top 10 go to places for, Taco Tuesday's or any other day for Mexican food/BBQ.

2 stars  for customer service,  5 stars for juices and 1 star  for prices.  I must say,  the location is awesome and the place is a nice Modern little setting.  Won't consider buying from here ever again.

This is the hot topic in my book.  I've been to too many sushi Restaurants and by all this would be,by far the best quality of food in my book,  staff are 100% genuine and the crowd that comes here are friendly and awesome.    This place is considered on my top places to go to in my book.  I suggest you try this place and tell me I'm wrong.
