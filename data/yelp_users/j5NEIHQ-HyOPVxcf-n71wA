I can't believe I didn't find this place sooner. They have great food and not so bad prices. The beans and rice are excellent! Their tacos on Tuesdays are a steal and some of the most delicious street tacos I've had in awhile.

I live right by here and have been going here for many years now. Its great to go for girls night, date night, or just a group of friends. I've never been disappointed by service or food here! Drinks are always on point. If you have enough room for it order the ice cream cinnamon tempura. Thank me later!

Their prices have really gone up. Food isn't anything special! Typical westernized "Asian" food. I use to come here 7 years ago and have come by now and then. It's alright.

I am writing my review based on my experience last friday (Dec. 26th 2014) when I came in for dinner. I had always came here with my family and we loved the food and experience but when I came in last week, it was like something from a horror show. I couldn't believe the customer service that was not only received but being given to those around us. When we came in, a gentleman said he'd be right with us to seat us. He never came back. Another person came to get us but started giggling and laughing and said to hold on a sec. He was looking at the seating charts I suppose. Another individual came up to help him and they had a whole conversation about where to seat us and who just got someone prior, etc etc. I am standing there in shock because not ONE but TWO other individuals came to help JUST to find us a seat. 4 people and neither could decide where until 1 of them asked a girl behind him if he could seat us with her. She didn't even look up and said "ya sure" in a bothered way. What the heck. I am sorry? We came in just to have a meal and be on our way. Instead we had this circus chain of actions. It gets better. We finally sat down around the right side of the restaurant. I noticed a table near us who had a different waitress. A gentleman asked her if he could have his fork and knife changed out while handing it to her, she rudely asked twice "excuse me what?" and he repeated. She said "Ok yeah" and walked away without even grabbing the utensils he was trying to hand her. We immediately got up and just left. Don't get me wrong, I love Red Lobster, they got wonderful food and beverages. I am rating this based on our experience at this location and how it was handled. The place wasn't even busy that night. There was only 2 other tables on the right side of the restaurant we sat at.

Some reviews on here are strange. I don't exactly think that important factors are being taken into account.  I've been coming here for happy hour and date nights and each time I am happy with the customer service and food. The last time we came, this very nice gentleman helped me out with something on the menu, he knew what he was talking about and it made me feel confident in what I ordered. Of course, our food came out delicious, gorgeous, and on point. I couldn't be happier! This has been my experience every time I come. They have great cocktail options as well, the moscow mule is most recommended. I just go with the kirin + sake. We've never had to wait long to get our orders, we've been surprised that even when busy, someone notices us and mentions they'd be right with us.

Came here with my friend for some martinis and appetizers. I was blown away by the calamari, whatever the sauce they put on top is... is pretty delicious. For happy hour you can expect to pay a little over $4 for just the calamari and they are very generous with portions. I love the crispy-ness and the calamari itself isn't chewy.   I loved our bartender, she was so sweet and helpful. The hostess on the other hand was awkward and rude. I am pretty sure she has no idea what her job entitles. We walked in and she gave us a rude stare as if we were suppose to be the first to speak. Excuse me, but a "Hi, welcome to Va Bene" would have been a thoughtful gesture as it is your job. We just didn't bother, we just helped ourselves to the bar.   Please Va Bene, inform your hostess to talk and let them know what their job duties are. They are not well informed or you just hire high school girls to stand around. We've had this experience here a few times.  The owner of the place was pleasant, sweet, and friendly. The staff who brought out our food was also very kind, this was very pleasing. Great establishment, great bartender, great food (pure excellence), great vibe, and amazing martinis.

Im not sure what all the buzz is all about when it comes to this place. I've been here a few times now. The flavors are "ok", nothing special. I love my chicken wings, these just aren't all that great. Their okay if you just want to get by and get your wing fix.

This is the only place in town with actually good ol fashioned Thai tea boba. Sorry other wanna-be boba places! I have tried to find some boba closer to me but they always turn out really sugary and taste too artificial. I just love coming here to get their spices pop-corn chicken with milk tea boba! Price is right, people are nice, and drinks are wonderful!

I absolutely love this place because there are a few things about firehouse subs that stands out from the rest of the other sub places. First of all, i've always had great customer service, the employees are always helpful and not so rude like some of the people i've seen at nearby sub places.   The subs are flavorful, I actually want to go get one right now because just the thought of it makes me crave them. I always get the italian sub, they put in the works and boom you got a juicy sub with lots of flavor. There is just some kind of sauce in it that drips while Im eating it, whatever it is, its delicious. Don't miss out on these great subs my fellow yelpers!

Not only was our service great, our food was delicious. There was raggae island music to give you the feels, clean restaurant area, and everything was perfect. I really can't wait to go back to this place. You can grab take out as well, we saw many people come in for take out. Go give it a try and get the oxtail entree, amazing. Also order the plantains! You can't miss out on that. Unless you don't like sweet, well then just go try the exotic food.

I use to come here almost everyday for 3 years. I came in to check it out and not only did it felt incredibly empty (ghost-town feel), it lacked the essence of what this gym USE TO BE. The prices have gone up as well. I will not coming back to this gym until it is under BETTER management. Whoever runs this place lacks any experience and knowledge of the rock climbing community. Sorry, but I've seen this place when it was under the previous management and the place was like "home" to many rock climbing enthusiasts.

What was once a wonderful establishment where you could come and hangout with your friends and enjoy fine dining (breakfast, brunch and lunch too) is now something tasteless. I mean that quite literally. I use to come here several times a week because my friends were working here and we all lived nearby so we'd spend a lot of time eating up the menu. I notice their corns are still a hit! But upon moving back recently from college, I wanted to give it a try since it been a few years. The reason I am not giving this place 1 star is because our waitress was very sweet. I can't remember her name but she was a pretty blonde girl with glasses, we adored her! She was so prompt, kind, and had a great personality.   Now for the food. I have always ordered the carne asada sandwich. I ordered it recently and there was absolutely no flavor. What once use to be a delicious carne asada that had this flavorful marination and sauce that would drip as you took a bite is now a very dry, disgusting, plain, no-good sandwich. I mean really? I am paying a little over $9 for a sandwich that has dried up steak meat with avocado thrown on top? and french fries that were plain and dry. No thanks.   My boyfriend ordered a chicken sandwich with corn on the side. His chicken was not only over-cooked and super dry, I am pretty sure there was NO sauce in his sandwich either. It had no flavor, we were using the tobasco and chalula sauce like crazy. This isn't the Hillside Spot I remember.   The only good thing? The coffee was great, the corn was awesome, and our waitress was a sweetheart.

I love this place and the vibe. If you get a chance, book an appointment with Becky! I use to go to places where they'd over cut my hair in all of 5 minutes. Those days are over! Becky is incredibly friendly, talented, and amazing at what she does. Leave it to her to make you feel brand new whether it's cut, color, and/or style! I'm always leaving the place feeling beautiful!

Great staff and environment. I'm never disappointed here! Everything I've tried here has been tasty and for great prices too! The Mediterranean chicken wrap is my go-to! I just had the salmon salad and it was excellent! Their happy hours are great too!!

Our service was great! Our waitress was so informative and kind and very attentive. We had their pho and it tasted wonderful, my only concern was that there was hardly any meat in it. I wished there was more. The price was right and atmosphere was great.

I am updating my review because I been coming here a lot more considering how close I live. Time and time again my service is wonderful. Last night we came in for some happy hour and tried their hottest wings. I absolutely love wings but what I love most about it is the HEAT that comes with it (if you're into that like I am). We got the scorpion sauce and it was excellent! Perhaps there a little small but it was $4 for half a dozen. They were cooked just right and our taste buds were definitely feelin it. If you're into spicy like I am, order the scorpion sauce with your wings! Will be coming back for more.   I just love the location, the people, and the vibe. The beer choices were excellent! I can't wait to see what kind of beers they'll be brewin in the future! Happy hour is just great! The price is just right!

Okay, surprisingly this was great! I was a bit skeptical at first because although I love pizza, I am a bit particular. This place was not so bad at all especially for the kind of place they are. What a great concept of putting whatever you like onto your pizza and have it made right before you.   I love the thin crispy crust, it's absolutely delicious and just talking about this place makes me crave some. I can eat a whole thing to myself in one sitting, so portion depends on the person and lifestyle.   The last time I went the person who was taking my order was a bit weird and kept saying how I must really like spicy. I mean he said this more then 3 times. All I got was the buffalo chicken pizza. It wasn't spicy but yes I do like spicy foods but I also like the taste of buffalo sauce :)   Check them out! Give them a try.

I give this place 4 stars because it is definitely on the pricey side! My smoothie was over $5! Beats getting Starbucks though. The lovely lady at the register was so helpful, kind, and very patient! She answered my questions promptly and gave great suggestions. I was very pleased with the pitaya bowl and the avocado smoothie! We will definitely go back for the acai bowl!
