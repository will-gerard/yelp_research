The Old Spaghetti Factory is an excellent choice of dining for both family and small dates. The price is fair, the food is made well and the service is above average.  The atmosphere is probably the biggest plus about this place. The restaurant has a fun but rustic feel with old wood barrels stacked about and a trolley car fitted with tables for dining in. The antique dining furniture combined with healthy portions of good food make this one of my favorite restaurant chains.  Free ice cream after a meal doesn't hurt its repertoire either.

Ziggie's is a great little store. I used to live nearby and would stop in for guitar, bass and mandolin strings. They were always helpful and would often offer a discount on strings if I was trying out new types and was unsure about them.  Ziggie's has an interesting selection of gear at reasonable prices. They lack the selection of big music superstores, but make up for it with strong customer service and inexpensive gear and repair options.

A great little bar with cheap drinks and quick service. I'm often at the Trunk Space, which is just 2 doors away. We sneak over between sets for a brew or two.  Bikini Lounge is cash only, so come prepared or face the unnerving punishment of ATM fees.  It can get loud and crowded; sometimes it takes a tight huddle and some shouting to carry a conversation.  Overall, Bikini doesn't promise anything fancy. It's a workhorse of a bar, pumping out reasonably priced drinks at admirable speed. I've never left disappointed.

I've been performing and going to shows at The Trunk Space for a few years now. It's a great little venue that fills a definite need in the community, for both musicians and artists.  The Trunk Space puts on all ages shows of a diverse variety. It's run mostly by volunteers and I've seen shows range in attendance from 5 people to 150 people (their max capacity I think).   If you're going to or playing a show at The Trunk Space here's some tips:  PARKING: There's a small parking lot for the venue, but it fills up quick and I like to let bands with lots of equipment take those spots. I usually park in the small lot on 15th ave, just a tad north of Grand on the West side of the road. If that's full, there's also parking farther south on Grand.  SHOWS: The Trunk Space is mostly standing room, with a few chairs. It's a very personal environment. Don't be surprised to see bands with some members off the stage and on the floor (the stage is pretty tiny, leaving little elbow room for anything quintet or larger). The A/C is a fairly recent addition and a very wonderful one. With the size of the venue, things can get loud; bring earplugs (or buy them there). Don't expect to hear any cover songs, The TS can't afford every little licensing fee. Plus, the original stuff is better.  BEVERAGES: The all important beverage is a factor in many shows. The Trunk Space is all-ages venue, so no booze. They do have water, soda and some caffeinated things available. If you're in the mood for a cocktail or beer, the Bikini Lounge is 2 doors down and has plenty of beverage options. Being cash only, they also have the closest ATM in case you need cash for the Trunk Space.  In all, the Trunk Space is a great place to view some local art and musicians. The volunteers who run it are great people and you're likely to see familiar faces every time you're there. It's one of my favorite valley venues and I hope its doors remain open for years to come.

I went here with my girlfriend. I ordered a steak and shrimp burrito. She got avocado shrimp tacos. When we got our order, they accidentally gave her chicken tacos. I brought them back to the counter with the receipt and they apologized. It took a little bit, but they brought out a new set of tacos. This time, they accidentally added mango instead of avocado.   2 Stars because my burrito was pretty good.

I eat here way too much. Great chicken fingers and even the smallest combo is still a hearty pile of food. I've had so much Cane's Sauce that it's probably my new blood type.

Angel's Trumpet is one of my favorite places to eat and drink in Phoenix. I like to try new beers and have never left this place without trying 4 or 5 new ones (via the flights, not full pints - otherwise this would be a review of how nice the toilets are to barf into).  Their burgers are heavenly, their desserts are rad and I can't express enough my longing for their chipotle ranch. I would fill a Camelback full of that stuff and hike Camelback mountain with it, if it wasn't so frowned upon by my doctor.  If you've never been, check this place out. Good food, beer and service. If you really like beer and chipotle ranch, stay very far away because you may never escape.

I've never seen my girlfriend as angry as she was upon leaving the office of Dr. Leo Biglaiser. We arrived to no office staff other than the doctor himself who asked her name 6 times prior to the exam. His equipment was antiquated and his process slower than kicking a bowling ball up a sand dune.  The worst of it was, when it came to getting the prescription, he began to ask what frames she wanted and she politely requested to just have the prescription. She said she would purchase frames online. He became irate, raised his voice and began asking why she would do that and argued with her about the decision. After half an hour of her repeating her request and him making comments like, "I'm not calling you an idiot or anything..." and "well, how do you know they'll get the right lenses?" she finally threatened to walk out if he didn't write the prescription and let her leave. He finally did after a few more of his rude quips.  The prescription went right into the garbage. His equipment was so poor, she was afraid to trust it. Dr. Biglaiser was incredibly rude and provided atrocious customer service. I would recommend Edward Scissorhands as an optometrist over this doctor.
