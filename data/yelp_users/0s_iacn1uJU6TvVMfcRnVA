Had an appointment on Friday with Alex to get my hair cut and colored. She did an amazing job, I absolutely love my hair!! I will definitely be going back for all my beauty needs!

First of all this is one of our favorite restaurants in vegas, whether we're just eating dinner or celebrating a special occasion.  Everything on the menu is delicous and the cocktails  hands down are some of the best that I've ever had.  Dont forget to order the giant fortune cookie for dessert, it doesnt dissapoint.

The food is amazing and I love the sake shots, but when you make a reservation for 7:30 and at 8 pm you're still sitting at table with no food.....kind of disappointing. The hostess' were less than helpful, and had very poor customer service.

I had 20 shirts made for a Fourth of July party in San Diego and they turned out perfect. Every step of the process was so easy, everyone I talked to at Brand X was amazing, and everyone loved the shirts!!! I will definitely be back next year and any other time I need custom apparel made:)

I love the food and have been to Diego Pops on multiple occasions, but today I experienced something so rude and disrespectful I don't know if I'll go back. I Have a service dog, and have had my dog on your patio many times before- but today when the hostess sat me- I was quickly and very rudely scolded by a young female manager that dogs were not allowed- I simply told her she is actually a service dog, and when I did so, I was asked so show proof- never in my life have I had to show proof of her being a service dog. I was so offended I wanted to leave. I don't know if the young women with dark hair was someone new or she just lacks manners- But I don't think I'll be back at diego pops even tho the food is good- it isn't worth the disrespect.

Currently sitting at the bar where I was waiting to order food, only to be informed that the kitchen closed early, therefore I was not able to order anything. New place so I know they need to work out the kinks, but the service indeed sucks. Probably won't be back, I'll stick to Fox restaurants, they never fail.
