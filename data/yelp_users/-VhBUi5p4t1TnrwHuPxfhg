I cannot give lower than 1 star. We walked into the establishment and stood at the door for 5 minutes before realizing that no one would seat us. Then we went to the bar and seated ourselves. We waited another 5 minutes and made eye contact with two individuals who were more interested in a personal conversation with another co worker. We walked out, still hungry. We probably won't be back

What can I say about Filibertos that others haven't said? Not much...except it's amazing food...I used to think that any Mexican food establishment that ended with a Berto of some kind was good, but clearly those places are just grasping at straws when they start to mimic Filibertos. Filibertos not only helps you with hunger pains, but it is still possible to feed a family of 3 for under $20.

DO NOT MOVE TO THIS LOCATION.  My husband and I have lived there for 1.5 years now. We have had numerous bug and scorpion issues. In addition, if there is a change in the policy - the office will say that they handed out paper notifications, but you do not receive them. We were slammed with a late charge when they changed their direct payment information (without notification) and the office manager told me that I was snotty and rude. She has still not apologized! In addition, because of some complaining about noise at the pool, the entire pool and gym close at 10pm. If you are not out of the pool at 10pm, you face immediate eviction. They rate themselves as luxurious, but in all honesty, you can find better housing situations in Guadulpe.

I was in your store tonight and went to the line#7, where the light was on. I started to put my items in the conveyer belt. The cashier didn't even acknowledge my presence. She looked over at the cashier on line 8 and rolled her eyes and said can you take her, to which the cashier said yes. I WAS ALREADY PLACING ITEMS ON THE BELT. I didn't say a word, just calmly picked up my items and put them back in the cart. As I was trying to get my cart over to the other line, another family came in (I admit I wasn't fast enough...I could've pushed my way over) and took my spot. The cashier#8 just shrugged her shoulders. I went to the red vest customer service guy, who was so busy in a phone conversation and simply held up one finger, to let me know that I wasn't that important to even warrant eye contact. ALL THE TIME LINE#7 LEFT HER STUPID LIGHT ON. I loved going to this frys location...but not after the CRUDDY customer service. I will be posting this on your Facebook and yelp accounts. Thanks!

I am from hog country, Arkansas, where we fashion our hellos and sports calls on the sooooouuiiee noise of the hogs. Waldo's makes me feel like I'm back home, where the tea is sweet, the meat falls gently from the bone, and you put yourself in a food coma with family and friends nearby. You cannot come to waldo's alone - you must bring a friend, family, or even a foe (waldo's will make you best friends). The baby back ribs are divine and the fried okra makes your mouth water. The sweet tea is is served in a mason jar and is sweet nectar of the gods!

Not a lot of indoor seating, but when it's kinda chilly outside, nice comfy couches to sit on and enjoy your own creation...currently$.44 per ounce and they have a rewards program, 50 points is $5 of your total, which you can save and cash on for a date night!

Dear lane Bryant, stop hiring people who ask if I'm finding everything and walk away as I answer mid sentence...

Fast friendly service! I have been here a few times and each time I am equally impressed! Not only do the have the BEST lox bagel with capers, tomato, and onions, the service is so friendly! As a plus, they text your receipt to you, so I don't have to hold onto messy receipt with BPA chemicals!

I came in with a pinched nerve and emotional pain (which we all know can cause more problems). Not only do they use Doterra, which is all natural and organic (isn't that the same?), they involve spiritual healing and pray for you as well.  My therapist was amazing, listened to me, reminded me to breath, and watched my facial cues for my pain level. In addition, they have a deal that of you pay in advanced for your next session, they take $10 of the visit. I will be going back!!!!

If you mention that is your first time, they pull fresh meat of the grill.  We stopped here because Brazilian bull was closed due to non payment of rent. we still wanted to eat meat. ..as we were driving around,  yelp told us of this nearby location.  The staff was friendly,  explained all the different choices for us,  and was very casual.  We will be coming back again!

A bit expensive for one taco...$2.50, but their salsa bar is amazing! If you plan it right, you could get a whole salad for free with this salsa bar. Ambience is just right, makes you feel like sitting in a small Mexican neighborhood with loud traffic nearby. Great for 2-3 people at a time, larger families or groups need not stop by...

This salon is TOP NOTCH!  Not only are they opened late, but D'Lisa treats you with 100% customer service. When I make my appointments, I show up on time and am ushered into the room within moments. The contemporary art is always unique and within reasonable price if you want to take it home. I wish I lived in the neighborhood, so that I could go more than once in a blue moon! But she is WORTH THE DRIVE!

I have been to this car wash location many times. I love the fact that they typical get your car in and out in under half an hour. However, they always try to super size your order and I got talked into a full detail coupon a few months ago. When I went in to use it, I specifically asked if they could get it done in 3 hours, cause I had to be some where later that day. I got a resounding yes, we will have it done in 3 hours. 4 hours later and I was pacing the floor asking hour much longer, 30-45 min. I was at the point of crying and stated that they told me 3 hours. They told me that I could come to the mesa location to finish up. That's exactly what I wanted...to get my car detailed two different days for more than 3 hours

I decided to give this place another try after my last episode...got an oil change, car wash, and icee for $50. It was kinda slammed by the cash register, but the employees wet up tempo. If I could offer one suggestion for visits of more that 30 minutes...install a phone charging station.

I was referred to Epic Beauty about 6 months ago. I feel in love with the organic products that Isabella uses. She even gives videos and demonstrations in what box dyes do to a girls hair. It's an amazing salon!

I normally come to locations close to where I live and have been here several times. Each time it's better than the last. Today, I got a pedicure and full set. During the pedicure, got a scrub and mask on my tired legs, toes were lovingly treated, and a much needed callous removal. All at a reasonable cost. The full set was great, seeing as I only get a full set every once in a blue moon. They're were many colors and priced to choose from. The client next to me got the express pedicure and was out in under 30 with very cute pink toes.

Really good pizza! We ordered a supreme pizza and wings. We watched everything being made fresh - from the dough to the sauce for the wings! It was so good, I wish I had come hungrier than I was! Can't wait for leftover pizza in the AM!
