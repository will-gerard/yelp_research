Dinner review: I've heard great things about t cooks for years, and finally had the chance to make it for dinner. Food was excellent - beautiful menu (options), unique presentation and overall, delicious. Prices are 'typical' for an upscale resort restaurant, not overpriced. Service was great, but not excellent. Ambience is unique and romantic, great location.

Great little hang out spot. Full bar, excellent coffee & tea, and great food. Definitely trendy. Good location, right off the light rail. If you're in the phoenix area and in the mood for something different, it's worth it!

Misinformed or dishonest sales associates (plural) cost me $200, even worse, the manager 'Faith' admitting fault but remains extremely confused at her role on how to satisfy (long-term) customers. No acceptable option or remedy was offered. Will never return to this location and will steer everyone I know as far away as possible. Absolutely terrible. Apparently anyone can open a 'franchise'.

Been here at least 20 times over the past two years - not because it sucks. Ncounter is a great little restaurant, ambience has a modern/industrial feel and the location is perfect. Great food, great service and reasonable prices - most importantly they seem to be very consistent.

Fancy little mom/pop sushi resturant and bar that feels like a trendy franchise. Excellent ombiance and food! Would have rated 5 Stars if the greeting staff and overall service was a little better. The hostess/manager was kind of rude and could've smiled and been nicer.

First time and had a blast here a few nights ago. Very unique and interesting way of making golf a bit more fun. The building is beautiful inside and out. Staff was very friendly and helpful, considering they've only been open a few weeks... Golfed for 2 hours, ordered food and drinks with our server, delivered right to our private bay! Fun and practical business concept, I'd love to go back and I'm sure this place will continue to grow in other parts of the valley.

I've eaten here at least 10 different occasions since the opening a couple months ago. Usually go for the kabobs - chicken, steak and salmon are delicious! Great service, food is very quick and consistent! Great location being right off the I-10. Go!

This specific location is absolutely terrible. Worst customer service, very slow and unorganized.
