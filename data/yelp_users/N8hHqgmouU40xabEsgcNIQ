I've been with Bulwark for some time now and never had any issues. Up until about a year ago they have been horrible with the scheduling. I used to have a monthly standing weekend appointment and now I have to call each month to confirm if they are going to come service my house. What?  The guy who comes to the house only does the minimum if he thinks you are not home. Not good. Overall it was good while it lasted but now its time to move on.

I've been here a few times and I have loved it each time! The ordering process is confusing, you stand in line to place your order, you have to get your beverage and go to the assigned table and then a waiter attends to you the rest of your stay.....basically for the tip. Anyway...overall good food. I'll be going back.

Glad I came but don't NEED to come back. Loved the fries and the burger was great but small. Good location but I won't be craving anything.
