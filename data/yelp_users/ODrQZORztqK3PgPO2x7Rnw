This place is amazing. The service is always on point! The staff is very knowledgable and you never feel pressure to buy something. If I had to single someone it would be Quinn. She suggested a piece to me that wasn't the exact color I wanted and offered to paint it for me for free. It looks amazing!!! And I'm in love it .

I went here off of the reviews of this yelp page expecting an amazing  dinner, but sadly that was not the case. I entered to a ghost town of a restaurant on a Friday night. I thought well maybe it was not packed because it was closer to closing time. I looked at the prices and were shocked, but then i thought well this must be one hell of a meal. Not the case. i was served my sandwich and to my surprise the meat was very dry and very bland. It had absolutely no flavor. i felt like i was cheated out of $15. My partner had a burger that was just a basic burger that they were pricing at $14. What a rip off. I would never recommend this place.
