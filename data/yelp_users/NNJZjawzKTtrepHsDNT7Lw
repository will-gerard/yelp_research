Total dive which is awesome  good drink specials. . However they allow doucebag behavior which is a big turn-off. Good drink specials don't forgive the bad behavior. I can get a get a 4.00 drink anywhere.

Overall great place for whatever you are in the mood for. Brunch is fantastic, order a mimosa or some coffee and sit on the patio and you wont' regret it! The guacamole is amazing probably the best in town.  Pork and shrimp tacos are to die for, hubby loves the Naco Torta. Happy hour drinks are pretty good, almost everything we tried was fantastic. Service can be a little slow but they try to make up for it with positive attitudes and refills, servers are always cheery and aim to please. One of my favorite places in town.

Worst service I've had in a long time. Good happy hour prices on beer but I won't be back.
