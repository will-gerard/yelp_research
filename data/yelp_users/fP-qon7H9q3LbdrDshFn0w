I came here with a huge party of about 20 and was seated outside. It was a nice and warm night too, which was great.   We ordered several salads which were good. But the pizzas were the best. The pizzas were not too thin and was so flavorful. I loved the crispiness of the crust as well.

Saturday brewery tour with Remy was amazing! I really enjoyed hearing about the history of the building as well as learning about their brewing process. The $10 brewery tour comes with 2 drink tickets or 1 flight, which can be redeemed at the end of the tour.   The only downside was that once the tour was over, we had to go back to the front, put our names down for a table, wait to get seated, and then order the drinks. It was really crowded, so our group of 6 ended up waiting more than 30 minutes for a table. I hope in the future, they would use that back space with tables for the tour guests. It was really inconvenient to have to wait for a table.   The flight came with 8 (generous portions) glasses of different beers. My favorite was definitely the peach ale. It was light and refreshing, with the perfect amount of peach flavor. Our tour guide, Remy, also informed us about their water, which is super pure. And I can definitely agree with him that it was the best water I had in Arizona! It was tasteless and so clean. We also ordered a side of fries, which were amazing!! They were deliciously crispy, and I wish I can get some here in California!

Tried ordering take out from Grimaldi's and Oregano's, but they were all 1+ hour wait!!   Spinato's gave us a reasonable 35 minute wait time, and it was delicious and affordable! I didn't try the baked spaghetti calzone, but it was a favorite among my group. The pizza was cut into squares, which I don't mind, but I was not expecting that either. This place is really small, so I'm glad we ordered take-out!

This review is for the tour only.  I bought my tickets in advance, and when I arrived, the tickets were sold out! Make sure to purchase tickets early!   I enjoyed seeing all the components for this field. You will get to see: the pool, the visitor's clubhouse, suite seats, and the dugout! As a baseball fan, I really had a good time and enjoyed the tour.   Be prepared to walk outdoor in the heat! The roof was open for our tour.

What an experience! I made reservations for my friend and I. We had dinner at around 6:30pm on a Sunday. We were seated right away.   Three servers were helping us, and they were very attentive throughout the night.   Our meal started off with complimentary bread. It kind of reminded me of yorkshire pudding. It was really light and airy. I liked it because it didn't make me as full.   Both of us ordered the bone-in rib eye cooked medium rare. It was cooked nicely, and it had nice flavors. I didn't realize it while I was eating, but the steak was really salty. I couldn't stop drinking water all night. We also ordered the wild mushroom side dish. This can definitely use less salt. To end our meal, our server gave us a birthday dessert- blueberry sorbet. Because we were so full, we ordered the banana cream pie togo. It was boxed nicely and I was able to enjoy this dessert later that night. It was delicious, but if you don't like bananas, don't get it.   It was an overall pleasant dining experience. I would definitely come back and try other dishes.

Not a super high luxury hotel, but very affordable and clean rooms!  I like the location- near Fashion Mall, Bellagio, Wynn.  Room service does not provide complimentary slippers anymore =(

I made a reservation on a Monday evening and was seated very quickly upon arrival.   My friend and I got seated in a dark corner, and the table was wobbly. But we didn't want to let that affect our meal.   Started off with a fresh baguette with a radish spread, which was pretty good. We both ordered the hanger steak medium rare. My friend's steak wasn't cooked correctly on some parts of the steak, however, mine was great. It came with pomme frites. It was a different type of fries...reminded me of fritos but less crunchy and more potato-y.   Overall, I felt that I was very satisfied with my meal and the price of the meal.

Great show!  I was VERY disappointed in KA, so I wasn't sure what to expect with Mystere. I'm not into following the story of the show, but more of being excited and interested the whole 2 hours. Even though I didn't understand the whole story, this show did not have me bored.   Some "filler" parts were a bit too long, especially the scenes with the baby, but it didn't ruin the experience for me. Best seats in the house are probably top tier & middle, since there are a lot of acts above the seats.

Don't understand the hype about this show. When I think of Cirque du Soleil- I think circus and fun acrobatic acts. KA was nothing like I imagined.   The only memorable parts about the show: The theater and the set & the scene when they're drowning in the water. That's it.   Everything else was a disappointment. I tried really hard to follow the story, but I had no idea what was going on. Each act was SO boring... baton twirling, shadows of animals using hands, jumproping on wheels... not impressed. I also felt like so many mistakes were made throughout the show. A lot of the scenes with groups of people were not in sync. Toward the end, there was a scene that was entirely digital. I felt like I was watching a bad quality video game for 15 minutes. I've seen many Cirque shows, and this is my LEAST favorite.   I am so glad I got these tickets for free. I do not recommend paying for this show, especially if you are expecting acrobatic acts.

Open 24/7!  My friend and I split a regular Asian salad. Our server was nice enough to have the chef split the salad into two plates. The portions were still huge!!

Wasn't sure what to expect, but I walked away satisfied.   Seats in the front are pretty pricey. Try to find a discount. Some of the acts were lame, but overall, it was entertaining. The finale was very memorable!

This review is for the tour only.  I bought my tickets in advance for this tour, which I recommend. Our tour guide was awesome! He was knowledgeable and funny.   I'm not a fan of the NFL, but I did enjoy this stadium. We were lucky to see the field inside the stadium as they were working on some maintenance.   A few highlights of the tour: media room, suite seats, hanging out on the field level, and visiting the visiting clubhouse.   FYI: On the website, it states the tour lasts up to 70 min, but ours was probably longer than that.

This place is a hidden gem! It is in a building with a dance studio and art gallery. Parking lot is pretty small, so you will probably need to find street parking when it gets busy.   The restaurant itself is all outdoors. I loved the musician playing for us! He played great songs and had a great voice!   We had quite a large party, so our server suggested we start off with appetizers. The restaurant chooses 3 appetizers for our table to share for $7 a person. The prawns were served on a plate with different sauces, the empanadas were also very good, and the nachos were good to share.   Their drink menu is quite lengthy. I decided to try to the popular Moscow Mule. It came in the traditional copper mug and was so good. The people are me also enjoyed their beverages as well.   The entrees come with sides of your choice. I ordered the ahi entree with a side of jalepeno cream corn and green beans. The ahi was great- thick and tender! My favorite was the jalepeno cream corn. I like spicy food, so I enjoyed the nice kick to the dish. I tried another person's cornbread. The description is a bit misleading. The cornbread is described as a casserole, so I thought it would come out with sauce poured over the top. However, it was just a regular cornbread with some extra flavors in the bread. It was quite tasty. I also heard great things about the cheddar mashed potatoes as well.

A few of us visited this place because it was near our hotel. We checked out their website prior to coming, and we saw that it was square dancing night!   There was no clear sign, but we saw an A frame to help us locate the place. We walk in and there was a live band playing music for the square dancing. I thought it was a nice touch and the music was great! There was also a square dancing instructor. She pulled our group in and we had a blast learning!   This place has a great selection of beer. There are only about 5 beers on tap and some choices of wine. Seating inside is pretty limited, but there is a patio outside as well.   We liked this place so much, we came by every night.

This is a great place to cool down on a scorching day in Vegas. This mall is huge with tons of stores (high-end is mostly on the top floor). Walking distance if you're staying at Treasure Island, Wynn, or Encore.

Don't be afraid of the long lines. It usually goes by quicker than you think!  If you feel like a warm meal, get their sandwiches! They're all so good! There are also wraps available, but these are served cold. The tables usually become available by the time you finish ordering.

Not sure why this show got such rave reviews. I was lucky enough to get a 2 for 1 deal, so I got tickets to see this highly recommended show. I've seen other Cirque shows which did not disappoint- Ovo, Iris, and Totem. Maybe I went to the show with high expectations, but Love definitely did not meet my standards. I didn't understand the story, there were not "circus"-like acts, too much contemporary dancing, and I dozed off here and there. I enjoyed the music, but not the acts. One thing I do remember about the show were the cool lights. I don't recommend paying full price for this show.

I came here for lunch during a conference at a convention and had a horrible experience. I would imagine that restaurants in the area would be prepared and staffed to provide service for big groups, especially with the convention center so close by. I was wrong.  1. Our group of 15 made reservations in advance. We got seated outside with four tables put together and was provided with only 12 seats. We had to squeeze in 3 seats on our own. Our table was so close to the main door that we (and the servers) couldn't walk through the doors. There was ample space away from the doors and was not sure why we were seated in such an inconvenient and uncomfortable area.   2. The girls' restroom door handle is almost falling off the door. Soon enough, someone will be stuck in the bathroom because the door needs to be pulled.    3. Our orders were taken fairly quickly. However, it seemed like we have been waiting for our food for an usually long amount of time. I looked at the time, and sure enough, we've been waiting for over 40 minutes. Our server comes by and let's us know that some of our plates of food went to another table. We look around and the restaurant is packed with customers with NO FOOD. We even saw some people walk up and leave the restaurant.   4. A free dessert  per table for checking in! I was so excited! I made sure to ask our server about this great offer. I asked him if we can use more than one check-in offer. (Don't forget we had 15 people with 4 tables pushed together) He told me that it would still be one dessert for our large group. He also told me to save the offer for another visit when I come back with just one other person. One per table is misleading, so please change the verbage of your check-in offer. It's misleading! I told him that I was not from the area so I would not be back. Even if I lived close by, I would not be back to visit anyway.    Our food was not as good, but because of the disappointing service I did not enjoy my meal.

A hidden gem!  Lunch AYCE is $20 (no drink included). Sushi is fresh and the rolls and other side dishes are awesome! Dessert is also included.

This was my first year visiting to see Dodgers in Spring Training.  I was so happy that parking was free!! The ranch itself is very large and filled with multiple fields. The actual playing field is pretty nice, but there is very limited shade. For a game at 1pm, the only shade I saw were the seats on the top section and the last few rows on the field level. There were many vendors, and the team store is pretty small!

I was so pleased with Mina's other restaurant, RN74, I wanted to try Pub 1842. Servers were really friendly and I got seated right away for dinner.   Wait times during sporting events will probably be longer. I noticed that some tables have a beer draft machine. The server explained that the table pays for a certain amount and can fill their own and pay as you go. What a great idea! The only downside, there are only 2 types of beer at each of these tables and they all serve different kinds of beer.   I tried the 1842 burger, which was pretty tasty. It was moist and flavorful. However, the asian salad was a disappointment. It was nothing spectacular and had some weird chipotle flavor.   I was able to redeem my Yelp check-in offer. Buy 1 get 1 free beer. Great deal!

Thanks to Yelp, I was able to experience a great BBQ restaurant! I had to do some research before coming here, especially with all the reviews about the wait time.   My group arrived at 10:10am and found a parking spot right away. We were third in line and luckily under shade with lawn chairs. A very friendly gentleman greeted us and offered us icy cold water. He introduced himself and we found out he was the owner's father. He gave us a brief history of his son's BBQ history and restaurant info. As soon as we got in line, tons of cars started to drive in. By 10:20, most of the parking lot was full and the line was starting to get longer. I highly recommend arriving 50-60 minutes before it opens.   By the time the restaurant opened, there was no more parking and a line had formed to get into the parking lot. The line in front of the restaurant was also wrapped around the outside patio into the parking lot. Right at 11am, we walked in and got a sample of the fatty brisket and sausage. I wanted to try as much as I could, so we got two plates with fatty brisket, pork ribs, pulled pork, and sausage. Because it was a weekend, the beef ribs ($20/1 lb) were available. 1 pound of the beef rib = 1 huge rib. My absolute favorites were the beef ribs & fatty brisket. The next time I come, I will definitely order those two again. We also tried all the sides and I liked the beans the best. There are various sauces to use with your meat, but all their meat is seasoned without sauce.   Dessert- Pecan Pie is highly recommended!! The owner's wife came by and explained the thought process behind the pie. We LOVED the pie so much we finished it, even though we were so full from our meat-filled lunch.   There are a few tables inside, so we were able to eat comfortably in an air-conditioned building. Customer service was also fantastic!

This is a great spot for some quality sandwiches. I tried the blt and it was pretty good. My friend wanted to purchase a cookie but the size of the dessert is so big. So the worker gave us a kid size cookie for free!!   This place is located near gate B & Smash burger before security check.

My very first escape room experience, and I loved it! I didn't know what to expect, so I was very excited.   Our group (plus another group of 4 strangers) were given instructions inside our room - The Apartment. The room looked like a normal apartment with tons of locks. Our goal was to open up 6 locks, which was definitely a challenge.   Luckily, throughout the hour, we were given clues by the worker who was watching us from outside. If we did not receive those clues, we would have failed to escape. We received so many clues I felt like we cheated, but we were told that we received the same amount of clues as every other group. This experience really challenged me, but I liked it! I'll definitely be trying out more in the future!
