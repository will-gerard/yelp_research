Delightful.  My falafel sandwich ($4.35!) was made with care. It arrived at my table nex to the window in the clean and orderly grocery store very hot, with a generous portion of tomato, just the right amount of onion and tahini sauce that had a bit too much "tahini-tang" for my taste.  The falafel itself was, again, nice and hot, but lacked an crispness to its outer layer.  The flavor of the falafel lacked salt but tasted very fresh and wholesome.    On my way out I purchased a couple cans of baba-ganouj and dolmas at reasonable prices.

Fast service, clean facility. But...  * Rice noodles in my chicken pho are gummy.  * Bean sprouts are brown / old. Hard to believe a Vietnamese place does not have fresh bean sprouts.  * Chicken in pho IS NOT FRESH. It's processed. Bad form.  * Tiny plate of the traditional side veggies.  Feels skimpy.  I expect more for an eight-dollar bowl of soup.

Fun audio snippets overheard from other customers: "private equity," "When is YOUR next cruise?" and "What do you plan to do in Israel?"  So that gives an idea of the clientele. A nice place to relax.  Okay, the food:  I'm on a mission to find the best pastrami-on-rye  in the Valley.  The pastrami meat here is the best I've tasted.  Clean, flavorful, not salty.  And they pile on just the right amount.    But -- ACK! -- here's the worst thing possible: The sandwich arrived with MAYONNAISE.  Really, I'm not kidding.  (I ordered the sandwich -- specifically -- with lettuce, tomato, onions and mustard.)  This is beyond "faux pas" for a Jewish deli, so I have go lower than the "A-OK" yelp defines for three stars and go with two.  Otherwise: The pickle was excellent and fresh and did not taste like salt, just good.  The bread the fell apart, a bit too dry and not a lot of "rye" flavor.  The red onion slices were about 1/4" inch thick, at least twice as thick as I prefer.

Although the bagels are the best in the valley , the food is merely meh.  With the exception of the outstanding whitefish; did not try the lox. The service  was very responsive from our server but the corned beef hash I had was boring. The coffee here it is truckstop quality. So the thing to do here is to buy bagels or bialys in bulk and run . Wednesdays are the day - that's when 18 is the price of a dozen.

Danger, Will Robinson! The Good Egg does not at all serve *good* eggs ... they are PROCESSED!  When the bill for our food arrived, the restaurant charged a dollar extra for an omelette to be prepared only with egg whites. I asked why. "Because it's more expensive for us," said the server.  "How can removing the yolk be more expensive? Aren't you paying for the same egg either way?"  "Unless you order an actual fried egg, all of our egg dishes are prepared with a mix."  "What do you mean, 'a mix?'"  "We buy pre-mixed eggs in a carton."  What in the WORLD!?   It turns out that even if my aunt had ordered her omelette with the yolks (read: normally) it still would have been made from a processed egg product, manufactured in some unknown location by an unknown corporate agri-business conglomerate.  The menu does not disclose any of this. If it did, business would drop like a rock.  The manager corroborated the server, that egg-whites only actually cost their company MORE money than if they cracked open fresh eggs themselves.   First, why would a company named The *Good* Egg use anything but actual and real eggs in ANY dish? (Whatever processed egg-ish product they are using certainly includes preservatives and God knows what else.) Second, if their processed egg product is indeed more costly, why is it their preference? As a business person, I will say out loud right here and now that the people in the restaurant are mistaken ... if the oh-so-important egg-ish stuff The Not-So-Good Egg pours on a fry griddle is so damned excellent then, well, the truth is that the only reason for this strictly business decision is that the product costs less, not more.  My family has been a customer of this chain - and this specific restaurant - for 15 years, and this not-fresh egg issue came as news to us.   We were not offered a discount when paying for our four meals. The server and manager both told us that next time we are in we will know to ask for our dishes to be prepared with actual eggs. There will not be a next time.

2/1/2013: Sesame Inn still getting an A Grade from Maricopa County Environmental Services. :-)  My family has spent thousands of dollars here since 1999.  Mostly because the staff will always do special orders with an "oh, sure!" sort of joy.  And it's the only decent Chinese in the Desert Foothills (Shanghai Club in Anthem ain't bad).  There are two Chinese menu items I sort of use as a test:  Spicy Eggplant and Hot & Sour Soup.  Either are often quite obviously *wrong* in other restaurants but not here.  Spicy Eggplant is EXACTLY how one would hope and dream this dish should be -- the eggplant is creamy / cooked to perfection and the yummy sauce displays green onion and garlic equally to the palate.  And it's always served really good and hot.  Hot & Sour Soup also has a number of distinguishable flavors floating around in it.  (As opposed to the too-thick salty goop many places pass off as Hot & Sour.)  The sour (vinegar) is always perfect.  I always order it without pork but no one else at the table seems to care because the deliciousness is nevertheless quite potent!  Oh, and this soup is chock full of all kinds of exotic vegetables.  This place is a bit pricey but there is a certain pride of workmanship going on here.

China "Joy" was purchased from the previous owners approx. 2008 and it went from "not bad" to "not so good."  It seems every dish floats in a sea of some sort of salty mystery spooge.  But the most memorable thing is the pissy attitude of the owner / hostess / server.    My wife's body had forced her into a restrictive diet and there simply were things she could NOT eat.  But -- you guessed it -- stating her needs and hoping for a positive response was NOT what China Joyless is about.  It's more like "You no like -- tough misfortune cookie! Buh-bye now!"

After many years of seeing all the press about the elite status this Promised Land of Pizza carries throughout the culinary world, I was finally able to duck in.  After years of anticipation I had a margherita and it was wonderful:  Freshly-made sauce, great crust charred just so and quality, fresh mozzarella.  But was it stratospheric?  Sadly, no.  Pizzafarro's in my hometown of Carefree is just as wonderful to my palate and who has heard of them?

There seem to be two kinds of Vietnamese places in the U.S.:  Those that have some truly authentic dishes made with weird animal organs and very little vegetables, and those -- like Noodles Ranch -- which are all about very fresh veggies and "clean" preparation.  Noodles Ranch represents the best of this type of Vietnamese restaurant and I consider it a real find.  Upon entry you can feel that there is a "lightness" to the energy here.  Refreshingly quiet, there is no television.  The staff appear to be family and are efficient, professional and peaceful people.    My girlfriend is celiac so this means she not only has to avoid wheat but is also physically sensitive to food quality in general.  Noodles Ranch passes with flying colors for her.    I highly recommend a visit to Noodles Ranch.

The patty is decent, but tomato was the orange color of a candy Hallowe'en pumpkin and the iced tea is not brewed but reconstituted - blech! The fries are innocuous enough.   Meh.

2013 Update: I'm back from five weeks of eating my way through Thailand and the Pad Woon Sen here in Anthem, Arizona is still a favorite!  Okay, I'm home from enjoying a  downright incredible meal at Dara Thai and -- guess what I'm doing?  Eating leftovers!  Pad Woon Sen rocks my house down.  Also brought home some bright and flavorful Tom Ka soup, which I will likely have for breakfast tomorrow.  The only reason I'm not giving a 5-star rating is that veggies are just SLIGHTLY overcooked for my taste.  And, of course, there is the sad vegetable quality all of us in the Phoenix area have to deal with.  Okay, so the food is great.  But this restaurant has something that has become quite rare these days ... serenity!  That's right!  No loud music!  No dumb teevee.  Just a good ol' fashioned, straight-ahead nice dining experience.

I had a perfect breakfast here.   First, I sat out on the patio, and al fresco is always a bonus. My mushroom omelette was outstanding, with just the right quantity of flavorful brown mushrooms. So many mushroom omelettes are made with small bits of bland white mushroom that the whole thing seems sort of beside the point. I also had goat cheese in the thing and, damn, that tasted mighty fine.  Another bonus: Espresso tasted like it should, with complex flavor and zero bitterness. This is not easy to do, at least as judged by the dozens of places around the western U.S. I've tried the stuff, of which very few get it right.  Service and serving was prompt. The place is clean and comfortable and, for the high quality of the food and espresso, better prices than I expected. Will definitely be back!

Oh, brother! The grocery prices here are OBSCENE! Very sad that there is so very little competition in the entire Valley of the Sun for quality food.  I mean, the old co-op way down in Tempe has been gone many years now. And Wild Oats was summarily gobbled up by this multi-national corporate behemoth.    In addition to grocery prices, the quality of their deli foods have gone downhill ... that food is now just sort of low frequency, if you know what I mean.  If not, oh well.    Sure, this place is fun. But, really?  I mean REALLY? Comparable items at Trader Joe's cost is at least 33 less.  Jeez Louise.

The latest stop in my quest to find the best pastrami-on-rye in Valley. This place? Ew.   Some of the meat was not chewable and the cole slaw had SUGAR in it. Nuff said.

Bland pad see yew and blander pad thai. Tom yum soup was flavorful - as one should expect from ALL Thai dishes.   Pad thai is supposed to be a sort of celebration, with all kinds of colorful, abundant ingredients. Instead, ours was a giant (3 meals worth), not very appetizing pile of rice noodles in an oily-tasting, bland blend of spices with very few veggies and tasty chicken. The spices were obviously not freshly ground.  Service was lackadaisical and this made us feel unimportant.   This restaurant is noisy, but not because it was crowded. Loud-and-so-very-annoying music plays while two stupid teevee screens inject Programming into patrons'  craniums, thus generating further cravings in the droned populace. The interior is dark, cold, hard surfaces - not at all relaxing.  I will not be back. Malee's in Old Town Scottsdale continues to be my favorite Thai.

If you are someone who actually gives a shite about the quality and wholesomeness of your food, you HAVE TO try Nourish. Clean, high energy food.  Gluten free and very creative.  The owners of this place obviously have HEART!  I understand the menu will be completely soy free soon and also offer some paleolithic options ... very, very interesting!

Ocho Locos does not participate in Maricopa County Environmental Services Restaurant Ratings -- beware.  Do NOT order a martini here. I asked for mine dirty and it arrived filthy! It tasted like 50% olive juice. Disgusting. The spinach enchiladas are truly stuffed with spinach, which is great. Tortillas chips are out of a bag.   I've been here three times and service is lackadaisical.

My sister's family loves this place for the burgers, but I have yet to try one of these.  They do look quite good.    On my first visit I had chili in a bread bowl, and it was excellent. Rich and flavorful, but not too acidic and just spicy enough.  The taco salad was my pick for the second visit.  It was the worst ever -- shredded iceberg with banal meat (I had grilled chicken) and a very small amount (2 teaspoons?) of shredded cheddar and ... what a minute, was that really it? Oh yeah, one other thing - a greasy, dark-colored, fried white flour tortilla.  The promised green chili was not there.  I hunted down the waitress, who was stocking glasses behind the bar.  (She had not paid us the privilege of returning to ask us how everything was so I had to seek her out).  I asked her for some guacamole in an effort to liven the dish up a bit.  It didn't work./  The guacamole was not from fresh avocados but that frozen concentrate cheaper restaurants seem to admire.  Have you ever seen this stuff in packaged form?  It arrives at the restaurant in the same packaging as frozen concentrated orange juice.  I'll go back to be with my dear family, not proactively.

This is not authentic Thai food, but that does not at all mean it isn't truly excellent ... because it is. Look, I was born a Jew but I've never practiced the religion - does the lack of integrity to my roots mean I should be avoided? Of course not.  Heck, my friends surely love me, just like you will love Soi 4!  The dishes here are creative, wholesome, delicious and made from high quality ingredients. And I love the mellow countenance of the staff people.

Caution: As of November 2012, Venues Cafe does not participate in Maricopa Co. Envtl. Services restaurant grading system.   I am truly surprised by the delightful experience at Venues Cafe this evening.  Surprised because a place this good and comfortable and sophisticated has never seen its like up here in the Desert Foothills.  And, truth be told, is quite rare elsewhere in the Valley.  But 'round these parts it's the antidote to buckets of cowboy grub!  We started with a high quality, "clean" shrimp cocktail.  Next, spinach salad ordered with bleu cheese dressing was perfect -- tossed with the exact right amount of a delicious but not obnoxious (read: not sweet or goopy) dressing.  Entree:  Perhaps the best salmon I've ever tasted (get it cooked medium rare!)  This included APPROPRIATELY SIZED portions of mashed potatoes and broccolini.  No voluminous portions here, thank you very much, just the perfect amount to make you want ... dessert!  Actually the strawberry shortcake was a disappointment as it was basically a nothing-spectacular cake with strawberry-ish stuff between the layers.  But not a single real strawberry, even for garnish!  Bad form.  But the warm, spicy and gooey bread pudding was dee-lish and certainly re-orderable.  The environs are an instantly comfortable, warm wood feel and the gifted live singer / guitarist, Dan Emrey, was so gratefully at a perfect volume so I never had to strain to hear my friends speak, nor did I have to raise my voice in order to be heard.  Whad'ya know?  A live musician who actually contributed to the evening rather than hogging the entire acoustic space.    "Bravo" to Dan and "well done" to Katherine and staff.

Espresso is not just kinda bitter (which would still be a major faux pas) but EXTREMELY bitter. I really, really want to support noncorporate coffee places . But, most unfortunately, with the rare exception, the only place that serve decent espresso is Starbucks. I am constantly looking for reasons not to go to Starbucks but it is just not happening. :(

I was excited to see another Chinese place open where Jade Fine Dining used to be.  The fact that the previous placed closed was not a surprise as I once had a bad experience with its not-nice owner.  Plus, the odd wall motif of tiny flip-flop sandals painted with odd still-lifes and landscapes put an air of doom around the place.  The outdoor sign for Tao Kitchen Asian Bistro #2 gives the appearance that the owners actually take the endeavor seriously.  Professionally designed, with the appetizing colors of red and yellow (ala McDonalds) informed me that market positioning was not an afterthought.  If the owners cared enough to commission a handsome sign, well, they HAD to give a rip about the food and service. Right?  Upon being seated I noticed a big teevee facing me, radiating football.  Ugh.  "Taoism advocates a life of complete simplicity and naturalness and of noninterference with the course of natural events, in order to attain a happy existence in harmony with the Tao." False advertising!  I was presented with an almost-tiny bowl of fried wonton as a "gimme" appetizer, but missing was the expected sweet and sour sauce.  Not a problem, as manufactured goop sauce is not my thing.  But I wished I had it, as the wonton tasted like ... like ... hey, remember when Mexican restaurants used lard and the refried beans had that thick-yet-slippery feeling?  Same with these flavorless wontons.  Not good, kimosabe.  Upon arrival, my parents asked for an iced tea and a hot tea.  The hot tea arrived lukewarm and, even after refreshing with hotter water, flavor just never developed.  Mom basically had hot water in a generic, ceramic teapot. Dad DID get his reqeusted extra lemon.  We discussed our options from a menu with a decent variety.  I was attracted to this place solely because of the gustatory possibilities of Broccolini in Ginger Sauce.  Anyway...  Hot & Sour soup -- It's not easy to find a good one (Sesame Inn's is excellent) but, still, if you can't do something right ... this soup was too corn starchy and just plain lacked flavor.  Not enough vinegar, among other things.  Fried Shrimp appetizer - More oddness as this arrived at the same time as our meal.  "Uhm, can we have some cocktail sauce?"  After waiting about four minutes a bowl of gunky, standard-issue sweet and sour sauce was haphazardly dropped on our laminate-surfaced table (hey, I miss Jade's white table cloths!)  On first bite: 1) The same "lardy" taste / feel as the fried wontons / refried beans. What the heck are they frying with?  2) The shrimp was obviously pre-cooked and then frozen (rather than frozen from raw) -- no flavor.  Fried rice -- Dad actually *struggled* with the plastic Suzie Homemaker toy serving paddle.  The rice was completely clumped together.  Somehow, we eventually scooped rice chunks onto our plates by sliding them out of the serving bowl.  I must say that these rice balls *were entertaining* as they fell from above and then rolled around on our plates. Nevertheless, these unappealing brown masses had only tiny bits of egg and cabbage in them.  No peas, carrots, onions or mushrooms to add just a little color / variety.  A Chinese restaurant that can't make rice?  What duh?    Kung Pao Seafood 2 - After ordering, the staff person shuffled back and asked "Kung Pao Seafood 2?"  We didn't know.  He ran (ALL the staff was *always* running around in a sort of panicked way) to grab a menu.  We identified our dish, indeed, as Kung Pao Seafood 2 ... but there was no K.P. Seafood 1!  Ours was the only one.  Odd.  The scallops were tasteless blobs of mushiness but I truly appreciated this dish's vegetable variety and that they were cooked just so.  The brown sauce was undistinguished.    Broccolini in Ginger Sauce - The crisp broccolini was served in pieces that were 12" - 18" long.  Given that knives (and chopsticks) were not part of our place settings, we had no choice but to fork these annonyingly drippy (yet crunchy!) spears into our oral cavities with little dignity.  I tasted no ginger at all and the veggies seemed to be drenched in the same generic brown spooge as the K.P. Seafood 2.  In general, the staff is so preoccupied with the doings of their job that they don't know customers are their priority.  Dishes often crashed and banged throughout the room (and at the edge of our table) and my water glass was rudely snatched from my own hand when it was decided I required a refill.  We were in the way.  We DID get the standard "How is everything?" but the question came out of obligation, as the server hastily blurted it out while simultaneously glancing about the room.  TKAB#2 is clean and didn't make us sick.  But the false advertising thing and lack of a caring staff makes me say "never again."

OMG, I'm converted!  Please ignore my review of 10/2011 as this place has become much better.  Service? Check.  Lard-tasting food?  Gone.  Quality and value?  You bet!  I'm so glad to know there is a reasonably priced QUALITY Asian place in the neighborhood.

Pros:  * Food was brought very quickly * Food was wet but the backstroke was unnecessary * Clean * Smells good * No television!  Cons:  Buddha's delight was the exact same, uninspired mixture of vegetables as our Cashew Chicken and Pepper Beef.  Tons of giant pieces of green pepper and tons of giant pieces of onion.  And tiny pieces of celery.  And no mushrooms!  What duh?  Whatever happened to Chinese vegetables, like snow peas, bamboo shoots, or bok choy?  Granted, the Cashew Chicken did indeed include water chestnuts but, as another reviewer mentioned, the chicken is PROCESSED.  Gross.  The pepper beef was in a typically banal, salty, dark brown sauce.    I used to seek out Chinese restaurants because they were the go-to place for "clean" food.  But the menu here exemplifies how far such places have degraded.  Of all the dozen or so chicken options, only one was not deep fried or breaded but actually stir fried.  Same goes with the Beef section, just one such option.   Unimpressed.  Now that they are past their bumpy start, I will take my business back across Carefree Highway to Tao Kitchen #2 or Shanghai in Anthem.  Both are better quality.  (By the way, Sesame Inn is the best Chinese in the Desert Foothills.)  Footnote:  Just like plastic bags in grocery stores, I know it has now become commonplace for take-out to be handed over in styrofoam, clam shell boxes.  Hong Kong Asian Cuisine is no exception.  I spurn such boxes for a number of reasons:  1) The absence of traditional Chinese takeout boxes degrades the specialness of the Chinese experience. 2) Clamshells leak, a lot. 3) If you don't want leakage in your vehicle you must ask for a crinkly plastic bag. So then you have leakage in the bag and therefore on the back of your hands upon removal. 4) Styrofoam is not recyclable. 5) Despite my best efforts, sliding food out of the container onto a plate is always, always a messy experience. 6) The inside top of the box accumulates condensation which, inevitably, runs over my hands. 7) They communicate to me that the owners are concerned with cutting corners.

This place rocks! I know, right? It's not hip, it doesn't have loud "music" and, well, yes, there is the occasional sick person. Not the place to take a date. BUT if you are eating alone ... very inexpensive, wholesome / quality, fast and full of choices.  I discovered this place when my dear mother was staying in the hospital. You get: Hot entrees, with daily menu changes, hot grill, decent salad bar, cold deli sandwiches made to your specification, giant walk-up coolers with pre-made food, ice cream, popcorn and espresso.   You can't find freshly prepared, quality hot food this inexpensive anywhere. I'm giving it five stars because it's the best value I know of in the Valley of the Sun.

I like the idea of this place ... a walk-up cafe with mix-and-match options, made to order. Nice.  But, you know, the food actually has to taste good if I'm ever to come back.  And, sorry, I won't.  I had the Budha Bowl.  Yes, they inexplicably do not spell Buddha correctly -- what, are they actually trying to brand the word "Budha"?  A bowl of noodles with an obnoxious amount of onions and peppers and few other veggies.  Bathed in a boring "hosin-ginger sauce".  I put the sauce name in quotes because I didn't taste ginger, or any other distinguishing flavor, for that matter ... I'm guessing it is not made on site. A quite-small smattering of mung bean sprouts and a lime on top.  Yawn.

Really great people working here. Hot & Sour Soup was very good. The sauce that smothered the Mixed Vegetables was too dark in soy for my tastes ... this dish is served in a garlic white sauce in most places, which I prefer. The previously last time i was in was probably 18 months ago but my server remembered me and, since I was alone, sat down in my booth and started chatting me up. Some may be put off by this but she is a dear and I was disappointed to learn she is married!

A five-star rating on Yelp *and* and 'inexpensive'? I had to try, dragged my parents along, and Thai Plates is indeed a new favorite!  We had an uber-Thai feast:  * Tom Kha soup was truly excellent, meaning the overall flavor was balanced (rare even in the Tom Kha world) and the selection of veggies and prawns were perfect. Friggin' delicious.  * Pad Woon Sen is my favorite Thai dish, a stir fry of glass noodles, eggs, many veggies and protein. I have had better (this tasted just a bit too oily) but wouldn't hesitate to order again.  * Black Bean Shrimp was too watery for my palette but nevertheless full of great flavor, generated not by MSG but the ingredients themselves.  * Green papaya salad - my mom (like me) is a veggie lover and I found it preposterous that she had never enjoyed this potentially nirvana-like experience. Neither of us were disappointed. As good Thai food should be, there was a great balance of individual flavors, such as lime and fish sauce and heat and the slightest sweetness.  The scene in this restaurant is quiet and comfortable ... thank God. Way too many restaurants these days feel it necessary to blast noise at its patrons. However, three very large television are suspended from the ceiling and, thankfully, none of them were turned on during our late afternoon meal - I just might have walked out if any of them were turned on. I am leery of future visits, however, as those teevees aren't there to collect dust.  The owners were very friendly in that most-pleasant way I've come to know after five months in Thailand myself.
