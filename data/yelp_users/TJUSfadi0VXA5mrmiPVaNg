I reluctantly sent my overworked husband to Joey's to bring home a carryout of chicken piccata and chicken Parmesan. First of all, the meals were freezing cold, bland, and the piccata had no lemon taste whatsoever. We had three bites and threw the food away :(

Hankering for a saganaki, I ordered a carry out from Greek patio.  What I got instead was burnt cheese the had to be cut with a steak knife and tasted like ash.  :(

We have been meaning to come here for awhile and we are so glad we finally did! The service was amazing, it was my first date night with my husband sans wine (im pregnant), and the server had the bartender make me a grapefruit "faux"ijito. It tasted great and helped me feel like celebrating!  The food was amazing, we had the short rib pasta and the the chicken.  It was mouthwatering but not so heavy we coukdnt enjoy the homeade donut dessert! We will be back very soon!

We were very disapointed with our order the other night.  The margerita pizza was lackluster and bland, and the orangini (sp?) and the salad were not very good either.  We had been to the restraunt several times when they first opened and liked it. Perhaps their carryout isnt as good or their quality is down, but from now on we will stick to cibo

First of all, Lori was a pleasure to work with.  My husband invited an extra 50 people to our baby shower, so we had to spring for the food, which was an added stress. Lori really helped out me at ease.  She helped me decide on the menu, and work around our budget. The day of our event, Lori and her team even helped set up the yard and helped us set up our bar, and drink stations (which we had not purchased from them). The food was amazing, and we got tons of compliments. Our menu consisted of eggplant and chicken parm sliders, chopped salad in a pasta shell, pasta squares topped with mini meatballs, stuffed mushrooms and bruschetta. I will definetly be using them again in the future.

So we had originally had a good experience adter the owner staydd late to alter my hubbys hugo boss tux for a event. Then months later I returned with a very expensive and complicated gown that I needed extensive alterations on for a black tie event.  I payed a hefty fee in advance to have the dress ready by the following saturday. When i came in to pick it up hours before the event, (and in full hair and makeup) and the dress hadnt been started yet! They had put it in the pile to be ready for a week later! I sat there fo an hour and a half sweating my proff. makeup job off anxiously waiting for the dress. When they were finished it looked great, but I should not have had to deal with the stress and last minute rushing.

We loved it here! It's Set in a cute house, it's very cozy yet trendy. We ordered an assortment of spring rolls, the sizzling steak, and pho. It was all so amazing, and bursting with flavor. The service was also great and they were very accommodating (we brought in our baby).

I've been going there for over a year now, for cleanings.  I was impressed with the nice decor and friendly staff.  But it was most recently wowed by the quality of care I received when having my wisdom tooth removed.  I had heard horror stories from friends about pain and swelling. Not only was the procedure not unpleasant, (they gave me headphones and let me pick my favorite pandora station), but I went home without any pain or swelling at all! I didn't. Need any medication and went on with my day! Thanks Dr. Nack!!

Nancy and Shayna made my son an amazing "Jake" pirate cake. Not only was it cute, but artistic and extremely delicious. Everyone raved about it and had MULTIPLE pieces!!!! They where also such a pleasure to work with. They are truly artists, and I can't wait to work with them again!

Perhaps a 2.75, I felt the food was in imaginative, the menu was small, and the service was slow.  I love all Mexican food, but this just felt like it fell short

My husband and I were so excited to see a trendy and family friendly restaurant pop up near our neighborhood we couldn't wait to try! We gushed over the decor for the entire time it took to get our wine (15 mins) which was sub par and room temperature. The menu was good, but only if you were on a "cheat day".  We ordered the only 3 healthy options on the menu and were VERY disappointed. The hummus app was the smallest portion of hummus we've ever encountered, but the stale pita chips were enough for a portion 10x the size.  My Caprese salad didn't feel fresh and his garden salad was blah.  Again we pondered, "maybe we ordered wrong" but come on, you shouldn't have ANYTHING on your menu if you don"t stand behind it.  It was so disappointing that WE WENT TO ANOTHER RESTAURANT  AFTER ON A WORK DAY THAT CRAZY!!!    This place makes me soooooo sad because its the first trendy thing within 7 miles of our house! PLEASE PLAESE FIX THIS WE WILL BE REGULARS!

I just love this place! Its bright and cheery and is designed  to put a parents mind at ease. It is a parents and grandparents dream: never too crowded, extremely clean, no blind spots, chuck full of toys, comfy couches for tired adults, and nothing they can't get into.  Best of all its owned by a lovely couple who are grandparents themselves. There are very few places in town where you can take your toddlers and not have to tell them no, chase them around, or watch them like a hawk.  Its one of the only places my friends and I can actually relax and catch up ,while the kids entertain themselves.    My 2 year old son loves it so much we just threw his bday party there.  They were so easy to work with, and very accommodating. It made the party "a piece of cake".  I look forward to coming here for years to come.

I DREAM about their Chicken Tikka Masala! I add vegetables which is extra but well worth it. We were dying for some last night, and got caught up at Best Buy waaaay too long. We came running into Marigold 25 minutes to closing and they were gracious night to serve us.  It was greatly appreciated and is still amazing next day as leftovers !

We have gotten excellent carry out on several occasions. I recently ordered a last minute carry out order for 17 people, and the server (I think his name was Steve) really helped me decide the right amount of food. And let me tell ya, he was right on the money. The we ordered (hummus, baba gannosh, grape leaves, chicken and beef shwarma, and fattoush and Greek salad). Everything was amazing.   We grew up in Detroit eating middle eastern food, so we are picky and Rotana is the real deal.
