Hands down the BEST Gelato in the country, or in most countries I imagine. I have had Gelato in Italy and this place is better!  No exaggerations. The flavors are VERY consistent. If you have one flavor and then go back 6 or 12 months later, it will be just as you remember. Presentation is excellent and you can have as many tastes as you wish before you order. If you go, try the Fruits of the Forest flavor. :)

Have a new phone only 1 month old and it has many issues.  Tech support was rude. My techs name was Esteban and he hung up on me.  I have a copy of the transcript to prove this too.  The soonest they would schedule appt to help me was four days away.  The fact my new 1 mo old phone doesn't work didn't matter to the tech at all.  He said "its first come first serve" for service and too many others have "issues" too.  Really?    What's that say about the quality of the phone then?

We love this place. It's awesome delivery service. We have eaten here for 3+ years and the food is always very good, especially for the prices. When we order, they always tell us about 30 min for delivery but then show up in 20 min with very HOT food. The restaurant itself is not anything pretty or nice. If you can look past cosmetics, you will enjoy the food.

Nice dealership with excellent techs. My challenge with this dealership is the pricing. I have a great service advisor named Derick and he tries to help but the corporate pricing is higher than real retail pricing or comparable alternatives. If they would drop the pricing to be competitive, they would have a lot more customers.

First experience at this location was positive. Service was good and the burger was above average. It's a good overall value for what you get here. I have a few small complaints. When I visited the website prior to going, the pictures of the burgers all showed fresh sliced avocados.  When I ordered my burger, it cam with a ice cream type round scoop that was mixed like guacamole.  It was still good and fresh but not what I expected. I will go back again.

I have been going to see Jerry at Eurotechs since he opened his doors.  Jerry is an AWESOME mechanic that explains the details well, spends time with you and is very fair on his pricing.  I have since sold my Mini Cooper and I still take my other vehicles to Jerry when I can.  He is always the first person I call.   I highly recommend him, especially if you own a Mini Cooper.

I started going to Lauren at her previous employer before she branched out on her own and started Salon Divine. Lauren has a great friendly personality and does a great job on my hair. I have now been going to Lauren since 2006 and love her new place and how personal it is.  When you have an appointment with her, it's just you and her - no distractions. I also like how flexible she can be to work you into her schedule. I would highly recommend her to anyone.  Yelp has blocked this review on Lauren's Salon Divine page for some reason?  This is a real review and I am a real customer.

Went for the first time tonight after this place has been open about a month. First impressions were very good. Warm greeting when we entered. We decided to sit at Sushi Bar and had a friendly sushi chef that was very eager to please. The menu is very large with a lot of custom rolls not found anywhere else. The choices re cool but also a little much to digest. The sushi chef recognized this and asked what fish we like best. After we replied, he suggested a "Special Roll" and it was awesome. Very good flavor and fresh. The service was VERY attentive, almost too much so. The staff works in teams and is very aware. I was asked three times in two minutes by three people if I wanted a drink refill. Too me, i like having too many requests than none at all. Overall, nice place we will go regularly.

Never heard of this place but my Jeep group was doing an event here. I have to compliment this husband and wife team for a great night, good service and a Great burger. One of the owners talked me into their "Scottsdale Style" burger and she was right!  It was very good. I will go back here again.

Recently moved in this area and Moreno's has been our family go to place.  Food is very good and consistent.  The bean dip they serve with chips when you're seated is Excellent. Our family eats the complimentary bowl in minutes.  There is a charge to have a second bowl but it is worth it. We have been very happy eating here and recommend it for sure.

This is on the top of the list for the personal pizza places that are sprouting up everywhere.  I like this one best because of the sauce taste, the quality of the dough and overall quality of final product.  The topping choices are very good but missing a few common options other places have.  This has been out go to place when we have a movie night since its next door.  Recommend you try this place.
