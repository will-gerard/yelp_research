Absolute best Martini in town!! Extra dirty, extra olives- our bartender (the good looking Mexican kid with the gages)- created a great drink and an amazing experience!! Such a great time. Awesome sushi too!

The service was mediocre at best, it wasn't too terribly busy and yet our server only came around a few times throughout our entire visit. I had my young son with me and granted he is a handful, but the server was not shy about making her dislike known about him. We waited a very long time for our food, we did order their famous baked pancakes which do take about 20 minutes, however we were never given the option to have the rest of our order brought out sooner. When the food did come out, the pancakes of course were piping hot, but the rest of the food, the eggs, ham, the potatoes were cold.  The potatoes are not tasty, I was not a fan of the eggs either. Although the pancake was delicious. Not somewhere I would go back to or particularly recommend.

Food is good- I love their wings and they were out fast and hot. BUT their service is awful... And has been every time we've been here. It takes forever for someone to come check on you, drinks take forever, and just overall lagging.  I know they're busy- it's MNF, and I love the place, so I hope for better experiences in the future.

We came here to watch the Draft, we had good service- the girl came around about every half hour (so that could have been bette)- but enough to get us our drinks, which were great, apps, which were also so good, and we enjoyed our time here! We'd come again for sure!!

Our family loves Barros! Their pizza is by far our favorite. A couple of weeks ago we ordered a pizza, for delivery, after over 75 minutes and no pizza we contacted them. A young girl answered the phone and said the driver had gotten lost, she apologized but essentially said "nothing I can do." Our pizza finally arrived, it was so cold :( My husband was so upset, he called back and asked to speak with the manager. Again he apologized but also followed with "what do you want me to do." His demeanor lacked consideration for our position. We did finally have another pizza delivered to replace the cold one. We gave them another shot just yesterday. Ordered a pizza, sadly again when it arrived it was ridiculously cold. This time though we didn't even bother to call. Lesson learned, simply not ordering from there again. Sad face.
