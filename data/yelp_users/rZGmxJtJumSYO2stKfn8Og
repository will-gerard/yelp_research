I purchased a Groupon for a month of unlimited tanning, when I went to sign up they talked me into an upgrade along with an extension. This ended up costing me an additional $80+ or so. I was under the impression from the young girl at the front that explained everything that I was actually receiving 2 months of tanning "great". Well after 30-days they said my membership had expired, the girl that signed be up said I would have to talk with the manager, I called and left several messages for her to return my call. The manager was either out sick or was just avoiding a flat out lie that one of her employees said and did not want to honor it. I did like this location for many reasons, but the staff is completely illiterate. I would rather pay twice as much for this service elsewhere than to come back to this location.

Shortly after posting a review of this location I received a response from:  Comment from Taryn B. of Celebrity Tanning 2/4/2014    " Hide Hi Trisha, I apologize about this, We would like to fix this problem if you would like to give our corporate office a call at (602)395 2673. Thank you. I have contacted this number 3 times now and left 3 messages with no response. This is the same reason as to why I will never refer this company to anyone. Not only have I stopped contributing to this business there are several other family members and friends that have now stopped as well.

I highly recommend this salon, from my first experience I was greeted with professionalism and smiles! From going to Celebrity Tanning to Maui Tan you definitely know the beds are clean and sanitized every time. The staff at Maui Tan are very polite and helpful with any questions or concerns I had or just advice that I needed at the time. Each room has there own wipes to take your makeup off or to wipe away the lotion (huge plus since I come from work).  I will not go to any other tanning salon after coming here!
