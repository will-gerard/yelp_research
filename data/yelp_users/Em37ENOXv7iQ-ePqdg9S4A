Pretty disappointed with this place after all of the great reviews on Yelp.  Went to dinner here last night, and all four of us agreed that it wasn't that great.

This place is one of the only authentic Japanese restaurants in Arizona! A mom n pop type restaraunt, it is very affordable! I ordered tenzaru soba and they gave a HUGE portion of tempura! I ordered a katsu don to go and was pretty disappointed with the portion size though. However, for the price, this place is great if you're looking for Japanese!

One of the best Italian restaurants where everything is homemade!! I thought that this place was absolutely delightful!!! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to have a delicious Italian meal!!! Our waiter was very nice and I really enjoyed the food. Check this place out if you're ever in North Scottsdale!

This is the best Japanese place in Phoenix --- the only actually authentic place that I've been to here!   The sushi and fish quality was the best for around here. Even their tamago was the quality one.   I ordered ahi (7/10), salmon (8/10) & tamago (10/10) nigiri, and a tempura & pork katsu dinner (8.5/10). We also ordered gyoza (10/10 - homemade!!! but only 4 pieces) and fried red bean/azuki ice cream (10/10).  This is definitely my new favorite place in Arizona!!! I've been dying to find an actually GOOD/true Japanese place and this definitely delivered! Will be returning very soon!!

This was a terrible experience!!! The owner made everything extremely awkward from basically the moment that we sat down. Before we even had a minute to look over the menu, the owner pulled a chair up to our table & started rattling off his 4 specials. The owner basically pressured us into ordering one of these specials and said that we looked "wary" and told us that they had the "best food in town". In actuality, the owner was overbearing and we just wanted to order what we wanted to order (I wanted a gyro but he made me get the lamb).  I thought the food was moderate, but would not recommend ordering the lamb. Further, the owner made comments about us using the Entertainment coupon. It's like if you don't want people to use it then don't offer it? All in all, I would not recommend this place as I had one of my most uncomfortable dining experiences ever here.

I just had a dinner party here and it was an amazing place for a celebration! The waiter was a little strange, however, the service was great overall.   The mac & cheese appetizer is amazing & I absolutely loved the pork chop! The dessert was alright. Overall, would definitely return here and had a great experience!

I think that this place is absolutely wonderful, with large portions, great food, and low prices!! You order at a counter in the Italian Grocery store, and I was actually surprised to see that there is a lot of seating both inside and outside. I ordered a pasta and thought it was amazing, and it even came with bread and salad. I ended up being so full that I took over half of my pasta home (HUGE portions!). I definitely can't wait to return here and think that this is one of the best places in Phoenix to get Italian food!

I thought that the food & brews were great at Four Peaks (although I don't think it was as great as I've heard)! I thought that the only thing that really disappointed me about this place was the fact that they could not accommodate a shellfish allergy as they fry EVERYTHING in the same fryer. I think that they have a pretty good reputation & I just expected a little better!!!

This place was AMAZING!! We got here 2 minutes before they closed and they seated us right away :) My boyfriend and I both ordered lamb gyro plates with a side of hummus & pita.  This place was SO GOOD & I was really impressed with the quality of the food. This little spot is located inside of a grocery store & we even walked around and bought some candy after dinner. I can't wait to return here for mediterranean food!!

I checked this place out this weekend with my boyfriend and thought that it was great! I've heard amazing things about Spinato's (best pizza in Tempe) & definitely thought that it lived up to expectations. We ordered an entree of the Caesar Salad [10/10] and a medium Super Six [10/10], which was more than enough for the both of us! Can't wait to return here...or order delivery :)

Love this place. Bacon, avocado burger + cheese is everything!!! Their onion rings are also really good.   This time I also treated myself to an old-fashioned root beer and was not disappointed!!! This place is overall a great place for lunch.   They are cash-only & have an ATM.

I thought this place was phenomenal! With great, friendly/informative service and a great atmosphere, I really enjoyed my experience here. The noodles that they use for the pad thai were different than what I was accustomed to, but I thought it was great!!

Actually really liked this place & I thought that they had a lot of different dim sum dishes than what I'm used to! This place does have a lot more fried than steamed dishes, but I really enjoyed our meal here! The food was tasty and the service was decent.

Food was really good here! Just wish there was more of it for the price. We all left full, but I'm just used to bigger portions when we go out for KBBQ.   I understand what the other people were saying about the service, but it didn't bother me that much. The waitress was really nice and I just let her know whenever we needed help because she was doing like so many other things...   Definitely planning to come back here!!

I've been here for lunch and tried their sliders and thought they were good. However, I had the breakfast sliders the other day and was really unimpressed with my meal. My boyfriend was also disappointed in his meal.

One of my favorite places to eat at Tempe Marketplace! LOVE the bisquits & apple butter they give you, and of course the baby back ribs are good.  Their fried chicken is also BOMB and one day, my boyfriend and I were feeling adventurous so we tried the brisket and the tri cut. We went pretty late, so they only had the end of the brisket, but IT WAS AMAZING!!! Not sure how the regular cut is, but this was soo good. Definitely gonna try to order that again next time.

Went here for St. Patrick's Day and I was definitely impressed! Although their set menu seemed a little bit more pricey than normal, I got to try their corned beef which I thought was AMAZING. Only thing is that I wish there was more!!

BEWARE OF THE FRAUDULENT PRACTICES OF THIS BUSINESS!!!!   I am absolutely FURIOUS!  After receiving TERRIBLE service (on a Friday night, nonetheless), which included my server not bringing items that I ordered when the conveyor belt was empty, my friend and I both decided not to tip him because of his terrible service and attitude in response to our requests. Today, my friend checked her online statement for her credit card and found that she had been overcharged $2. I go online to check my statement to find that I had also been overcharged $2. Checking with the 3 other friends who ate with us and decided to tip the server, we were the only 2 who were charged an extra $2 on top of our bill. Furious, I called Teharu, was told that the manager was unavailable and proceeded to begin explaining my situation and was asked if I left a tip. I explained that I hadn't because I had received terrible service. In my opinion, by not leaving a tip I am helping my server to realize that he did a terrible job and he will therefore reevaluate his service and perhaps improve upon it. Being that many people comment on their subpar service that they receive here, the servers must not be tipped very well. Is this the way that Teharu responds? By overcharging customers illegally? When I sign a Merchant's receipt, I am agreeing to pay the amount that I write...NOT any more than that. It's no wonder that their service does not improve...Teharu is illegally making customers tip their servers (I bet we are not the only ones that this has happened to) which causes the servers in turn to have no incentive to improve their customer service. What upset me even more was that the woman on the phone said that there is "no proof" that I had been overcharged unless I bring in my receipt and bank statement, in which case they would refund $2 to my account. Obviously, it's only $2 so I'm not going to go all the way there just to get it back...I'll probably spend more on gas doing that. What infuriates me however is that when I explained that what Teharu did was ILLEGAL and FRAUDULENT, the woman on the phone was absolutely unfazed and did not seem to care about her business' immoral practices. Furthermore, my friend is a very light eater and $2 was nearly 33.3% of her bill. Imagine that - terrible service and a 33.3% tip? This business is absolutely terrible...I refuse to support a business that cheats customers out of their money by means of illegal and fraudulent practices.   UPDATE: My friend spoke to the manager, who was apparently on break when I called earlier, and he said that he saw his worker on the phone with me and considered intervening (but didn't). The manager continued to claim that this was a "mistake" and that it happens "often". My friend said that he seemed concerned and wanted to help us by offering to refund us $2. However, we do not care about the money, but rather that this does not affect other people. Therefore, our concern is not about the fact that we were both overcharged, but rather that this business is not taking the necessary actions to ensure that their customers are satisfied and treated with honesty and respect. Being that the manager recognized that this is a problem that arises often, I do not understand why they are not taking this issue more seriously and investigating the source of this problem...if it happens so often, how is it an accident?! We expressed that we do not think that this is an accident in any way and that we will be contacting the police to investigate Teharu's fraudulent business activities. Furthermore, I have already submitted a complaint to the Better Business Bureau.  If you have eaten at Teharu and paid via credit card, I highly suggest that you check your bank statement to see if you were overcharged. If you were overcharged, I hope that you will either comment on this post, submit a complaint to the BBB, or call the police directly as I will be contacting them shortly. I do not feel that anyone should sit by and allow a business to conduct themselves in this manner - it is not only wrong, but ILLEGAL and I am determined to put an end to Teharu's fraudulent practices.

the food was amazing!!! loved the filet, it was really flavorful. also thought the double baked potato was good. prime rib was ok (honestly i was a little disappointed).  we got there pretty late so i don't know if that's why, but service wasn't the best. definitely going to be going back.

This place is my weekend go to for delivery. Their Pad Thai is great with chicken & I always order their Pineapple Curry with Shrimp. They have decent calamari as well.   Overall this place is quick whether it be delivery or dine in. Have dined in here before and it is a very nice atmosphere for the price. Normally delivery takes about 45-60 minutes, but totally worth it!

Got delivery for this place. I would recommend the mapo tofu (medium). It was pretty good and the portions were huge! The General Tso's chicken was okay, and not so good the next day.

Thought this place was absolutely amazing & LOVE my nails!!! The only thing I have to say is that it definitely takes longer than 10-15 minutes if you're getting a design done. The girls in here were really friendly & you could tell they were really experienced! I would definitely return here, as it compares with Japanese nail salons in Hawaii...if only they had one closer to me!

I absolutely loved this pizzeria and definitely think it deserves 4.5 stars!! The ambiance was really cute both inside and on the patio. We sat on the patio and had a decent view of the valley, and our chairs even had blankets to make it extra cozy! The wood fired magherita pizza was great!!!

This place is awesome! Super cool staff & the hostess, Julie, is great! I had their habanero burger with waffle fries and it was GOOD! The Mac and cheese with brats was also good! Overall loved this place and the super cool atmosphere, there are sasquatches to take pictures with & lots of games inside and outside. Would love to come here at night and experience the outdoor patio area!   I definitely recommend checking out this hot & new eatery/bar in Tempe's Farmer Arts District :)

This is definitely the best ramen & only real Japanese ramen place I've come across so far in Phoenix! I ordered the gyoza (nothing special) and the spicy miso ramen (8/10). I added the pork belly (10/10) which was amazing!! I got an extra egg & their egg was on point!   Overall, this is the best ramen place you'll find in Phoenix, but it's not the best ever.

I found this place off of Yelp and wanted to try it based off of positive reviews. I was disappointed with the food, which came out cold, as well as the sub-par service. I ordered the fish & chips and was not happy with what I got (especially since pictures looked good).

I saw a sign on Scottsdale Road for ACAI BOWLS --- and being from Hawaii, I had to try this place! There have been a lot more places in Arizona that are starting to serve acai bowls, and I thought that this place was pretty good. I had the Sedona Bowl, which is a basic acai bowl with strawberries, bananas, granola, and honey. The regular size was more than enough, and I got it blended (but also tried the soft serve, both of which were good). Definitely not the best that I've ever had, but I will definitely be returning here whenever I need a fix!
