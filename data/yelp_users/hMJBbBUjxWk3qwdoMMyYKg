Steak was under cooked, staff was slow, and to top it off, we hear the manager arguing loudly with the elderly couple across from us about how they didn't know what medium was. So what you're telling me is we ordered two steaks cooked the same way and we're complaining about the wrong one? The one we think is good is actually over cooked?....

Love this place!  Best Chinese food in the area! I work in the area and love this place for lunch. They have great meal specials during the lunch hours and their food is made fresh and tastes great! They even make their crab puffs in house fresh!! A must try!! The owner is in often and very nice. This family owned restaurant is a hidden gem in Chandler!

Service was slow and not great. Seen waitress standing around while I was out of water and out of bread for nearly 20 mins. She was overly attentive to table next to us due to getting the order wrong continually. I had to ask for a dessert menu twice and she still hasn't came back to take our order for at least 15 mins as our corrected meal was brought out by a different staff member ( we asked for it to go so we could make a movie but it's still sitting in front of us, plated.) We love the spinach manicotti though, so we'll be back. Hopefully with better wait staff, especially on a Friday night.

My husband and I frequent this gelato shop and love the quality of their gelato in addition to the frequently rotating flavors. I highly recommend giving this locally owned shop a try! Plus with the great $5 for $10 yelp deal you can't go wrong! (that plus 15 cents will get you two larges)

Terrible! I had a family member pass away and missed my flight and they said well, because you didn't notify us 24 hours in advance you forfeited your flight; regardless of the travel insurance I purchased and the travel insurance documentation even says if there's a death you have 168 hourst to rebook. They told me their allegiant policy over rules the trip insurance document.... um then why did you sell it to me if it doesn't mean anything and the original rules of the ticket travel still apply? Well that's our "Prerogative." Click. SERIOUSLY? Worst customer service out of any company I've done business with, by far. Why would anyone fly with this company? First and last experience. Also, this was one of several calls I had put into them with either promises of automated call backs, within 1-2 hours, or after sitting on hold for a hour+ and then disconnected once someone "picked up" but chose to be silent and disconnect the call, or customer service saying they couldn't pull it up at that moment and would call me back... So despite my extensive attempt, a death in the family which was very difficult on its own, my purchasing travel insurance through them in case of emergency, I've completely forfeited my flight... voluntarily. In short, they have the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!

We frequent Nando's and love their food. You get a large portion and complimentary chips. Yesterday afternoon we went for lunch/dinner and the service was slow, it took nearly 30mins to get our food after ordering. (It wasn't super busy either; there wasn't a wait to be seated) Also, I asked for a substitute and they up charged a ridiculous amount without advising, which is  disappointing. I spent about $20 on a $12ish Chicken Flauta meal all because I asked for a side salad, which was literally only lettuce and shredded cheese, instead of the rice and beans and queso on my flauta instead of guac, sour cream, or cream cheese. --that's my normal meal there and normally they sub for no additional charge, just depends on the waiter I guess. Overall, we like their food and will return!

My husband and I frequent this establishment often. The staff is always very friendly and quick, which we like. We love their Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza, but they've taken it off the menu. Most of the time they'll make it for us anyways, but a couple times, when ordering via phone we were denied our special request.
