Had some of the best service I've ever had while attending a Twin Peaks. My server Bianca went above and beyond to make sure I feel comfortable and welcomed. I am not one for eating at those type of establishment but if I ever feel the craving for greasy food I will definitely be back

Just moved from Texas and every time I go in I do not feel welcome like I do in Dallas. I feel as if I am bothering them. The two gentlemen that work there are always helpful but not so much the ladies.

The manager at the store is amazingly helpful and full of energy and life that makes you want to come back to that store again and again
