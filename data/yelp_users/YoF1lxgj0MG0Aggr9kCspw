Got lost looking for Starbucks, stumbled in here, RYAN,, stepped forward with a bright Good Morning, hands behind his back, gotta love the military. He was polite,informative, pleasant,  I bought Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, buy One and get somnething else half off, He showed me a few things, and I bought some B12 drops. To the management, excellent in hiring this kid... New to Tempe, I will defn return for all my Supplements!  Thanks  Ryan!

So, a friend suggested we have our coffee date here at Shine, we usually do Lux or Starbucks, so Tomorrow, at 8am sharp, we will arrive promptly in our limo, from the British Embassy!, I am sure Driver knows how to get there, and cook will come along to observe and take notes on the Cardamon Cappuccino, so we may, recreat when Royalty comes.. Hoping it stands the test.... Jules and Kris :)  Update: Awesome place, GOOD coffee, Excellent Service, my friend and I sat and talked in the living room for almost 3hours....   thumbs up!!!! will be back, btw ,, the music selection was perfect!....

I have lived from Montreal to Miami, and this is the best value for your money , tastiest food, quickest delivery, and most polite Staff. I just moved to TEMPE, and was looking for Chinese delivery, tried Mr Hunan, gross, tried Szechuan, closed.. This came up on SIRI,.. I have tried Shrimp w Broccolli Amazing, Fresh, and ate 3xs, and I have a big boy appetitite, the Wonton Soup, Amazing,.. and the Crab Rangoon, the Largest and tastiest ever, the delivery guy even bowed to me, after exchanging cash for food.... I am so impressed, they are now my go to for Express Chinese Takeout..

Had a cappuccino. just awful., I couldnt figure out why, I even added sugar, which I never do, still couldnt drink it, finally said something to the waittress,, she responds oh, we use 2 shots of espresso, REALLLY? WISH SOMEONE HAD TOLD ME PRIOR.  The wait for the $12.95 egg breakfast was 45 mins... ridickoulous.  Then the " owner" stands nx the the table next to us, with his ass in my face , chatting for 30mins,,, very uncomfortable...  will NOT return...
