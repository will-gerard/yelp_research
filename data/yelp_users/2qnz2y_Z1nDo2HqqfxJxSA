We've tried this place several times in the past few years, and each time that we do, I end up kicking myself for giving it another shot.  I just do not understand the reviews raving about the sushi here!  Once again, the fish we had was of mediocre quality at best.  Maybe I'm just missing something here since it seems like the regular customers are able to command the best quality fish (or at least it certainly looked a lot better than what we had), but the fish just isn't all that fresh and the service is consistently lackluster.  We sat at the sushi bar and literally had to flag down the waitress to get our drinks refilled.  We had some Hamachi and Maguro nigiri, neither of which were impressive and a couple of rolls, one of which was the Negi Toro roll that I had to force myself to eat given the off taste it had.  We'd actually assumed that the sushi chef had forgotten about the Maguro nigiri and were ready to leave, but as soon as we flagged down the waitress, he presented the two pieces to us, nearly a half an hour after the last roll he'd served us when the place was less than half full.  I find it strange to hear how many other reviews mention the number of Asian people they see eating here and somehow manage to draw the conclusion from that fact that this is a great place.  That would seem to follow the logic of visiting Europe and seeing a McDonald's filled with Americans and drawing the conclusion that McDonald's is a top-notch American restaurant.  The point here is that not everyone is discerning regardless of whether they are eating their native fare and I find it difficult to believe that this would be considered a quality sushi restaurant among discerning Japanese diners given how much better quality sushi is available in the Valley.  Our last visit to Hiro will be our last and for anyone looking to find fresh, high quality sushi in Scottsdale, I would highly recommend trying Yume at the Scottsdale Promenade.

This is our favorite wine bar in Scottsdale!  The atmosphere offered by the cave-like speakeasy environment offers a unique retreat from the typical bar scene and the selection of wines and beers changes regularly so there is always something new to try rather than the same boring, tired selections that many places offer on their stagnant and never-changing menus.  The staff always offer great service and can usually offer a winning wine recommendation when we describe what we like.  They also have beers from worldwide locations including some obscure places that one wouldn't ordinarily expect to find a quality brew, but my husband has found numerous beers here that he loves.  The place can get a bit loud when they have a DJ playing, but the uniqueness of the overall experience outweighs any negatives and is definitely a place that's worth checking out.

Malee's is my favorite Thai restaurant in the Valley!  The atmosphere is much nicer than many other Thai restaurants that I've been to and the curry can't be beaten.  My favorite is the Arizona Heatwave, which I typically order "very spicy" with tofu.  To translate, "very spicy" at Malee's means that there's good flavor and spice for someone who typically likes spicier food without being so overpowering that one's mouth is simply burning so badly that the actual flavors of the food are masked.  The dinner portion is definitely quite a bit larger than the lunch portion, so if you're looking to take leftovers home, you'll want the larger size.  The tofu spinach pot stickers are also a great appetizer and are served with a variety of tasty dipping sauces.  The only real negative that I've encountered food-wise is the peanut dressing that comes on the salads by default.  It's so heavy and the salad is just drowning in dressing to the point that it's impossible to taste the salad itself.  That problem is easily remedied, however, by asking for the sesame ginger dressing which is much lighter.  While I've never attended, Malee's offers cooking classes once a month at which they provide instruction on how to make some of their signature dishes.  It sounds like fun, but my logic is why go through the trouble of cooking the food myself when I can just go to Malee's and have a great meal while someone else does the work!

A very poor excuse for Mexican food.  We arrived at lunch to find the place packed and had a bit of a wait, which despite the run-down lackluster interior, we viewed the popularity as a positive sign that we were in for some great food.  We were finally seated and were provided with food-covered menus and a basket of chips and watery, flavorless salsa.  The waiter finally came over to take our order after a long wait at which time we also requested some silverware and napkins.  After another ten minutes, he finally brought us some water and some well used silverware rolled in a paper napkin.  One would have thought that with salsa so watery, they would have provided us with some plates to prevent dripping all over the table, but the overall lack of cleanliness of the place seemed to suggest otherwise.  The chips themselves were greasy and bland and we only consumed some of them because we were both famished.  After another lengthy wait, my veggie burrito finally arrived. I only managed to get through a few bites of this greasy, flavorless disaster before calling it quits and heading back to the office still hungry.  The burrito consisted of nothing more than soggy, overly greasy, limp, overcooked vegetables, of which spinach was the predominant variety.  There was no flavor to any of it or any spice, sauce, etc. that would give one the impression of eating Mexican food.  I have absolutely no idea why people would flock to this place.  The atmosphere is that of a dirty cafe with tables packed on top of each other and the food is beyond horrible.  While I avoid fast food at all costs, I can honestly say that I would eat at Taco Bell before ever coming back to Frank & Lupe's.

There are so few restaurants that deserve a 5-star rating, but Razz is undoubtedly one of them.  While the exterior of the building appears nondescript, the interior is tastefully decorated and replete with artwork hanging on the walls.  We always make a reservation to sit at the chef's table and everything we've ever had has been phenomenal.  My husband and I have very diverse tastes and are willing to try just about anything, but I can honestly say that beef tongue is probably not something that we would ever have ventured to taste had it not been served to us here.  It's now one of our favorite dishes, as is the "macaroni and cheese" with lobster and crab meat.   The wine selection is great as well and we typically ask Razz to recommend a bottle and have never been disappointed.  It's so clear that Razz is an incredibly talented chef who is doing what he loves to do!  The restaurant does close over the summer so we will be eagerly awaiting its reopening in the fall to try some more of Razz's amazing creations.

I'll preface this by saying that this review is based solely on the food and not the ambiance or service as we ordered take-out, but based on the poor quality, awful food that we had, I wouldn't care to venture back to find out if they've made any improvements.  We ordered the following items: garlic bread with cheese, bruschetta, a greek salad, a caesar salad, and a margherita pizza.  The only item that was even moderately edible was the garlic bread with cheese, which was nothing more than your typical greasy garlic bread.  The bruschetta was a mix of tomatoes, capers, onions, and some other nondescript items that was meant to be spooned onto some of the most rock hard "pieces of toast" that I've ever had the misfortune of trying to eat.  After the first bite, we both stopped eating for fear of a costly dental bill.  The greek salad that we ordered was not among our take-out order as they had mistakenly given us a wedge of iceberg lettuce instead, which we promptly tossed into the trash.  The caesar met a similar fate as the container of dressing was not even homemade dressing but appeared to be the type of super creamy caesar dressing that comes in a bottle from the grocery store and tasted awful.  Yuck!  While it seemed like a true feat to top the horrible start to our meal, Nick's managed to deliver and our disgusting pizza made the whole meal even more nauseating.  The cheese was oily and of extremely poor quality and the fresh tomatoes were so pale that they were nearly white and completely flavorless.  After one slice each, the pizza found its way into the trash as well.  We'd only paid about $40 for the food, and after our experience, it's clear that the low prices are driven by the purchase of bargain basement ingredients that are not up to the standards of even moderately selective restaurants.  I really can't think of a place that one could go to receive worse Italian food than that served at Nick's.

The overall atmosphere is modern and contemporary and offers a more traditional dining area downstairs with a jazz lounge upstairs where the bar is located.  The place is generally loud on whichever floor you choose so we've opted for the upstairs jazz lounge as we prefer the sound of music over the usual loud restaurant roar.  Overall, the food is really quite good.  The escargot is served on mushrooms and could use a bit more garlic, but isn't bad.  The Caesar salad came with just the right amount of Caesar dressing that was fairly light and not overly creamy.  The vegetarian paella is an excellent dish and probably my favorite item on the menu.  The various vegetables are all cooked to just the right level of crispness/tenderness as appropriate and the serving is so huge that I always end up taking half of the dish home.  The capellini and pomodoro, which can often be a somewhat boring dish, was flavorful with fresh tomatoes, garlic, and basil.  The Chilean sea bass was good, although I'm used to a thicker cut of fish than what was served and my husband found the gorgonzola mashed potatoes to be suitable as far as flavor but a bit off-putting in that they left a strange filmy texture on his teeth, perhaps from the gorgonzola.  They also provide a basket of fresh garlic bread that has just the right amount of cheese on top of it.    The wine list has some decent selections, but isn't the best I've ever seen, however, we've managed to find a palatable selection on each of our visits.  The entertainment is generally reasonably decent too, nothing that I would pay a cover charge for, but for entertainment during dinner, it's really not bad.  Overall, this is a place that we'll be back to as we've had consistently good experiences here.

I can't believe that this place is so close to my office and it took me three years to finally stumble across it!  After having read the reviews, I decided to give it a shot once I realized that they actually do have a fairly extensive veggie-friendly menu.  Despite not being a fan of fake meat products, I decided to try the veggie asiago chicken pasty and was pleasantly surprised.  The brand of "wheat meat" that they use actually had good flavor and an unusually normal texture.  The pasty also contained corn, black beans, hatch chiles, stewed tomatoes, and was not overwhelmingly heaped with asiago cheese.  The salsa that was served on the side was flavorful and a nice accompaniment to the already spicy pasty.  The crust was flavorful and flaky, just like the pasties that I remember getting growing up.  The only drawback is that the place is incredibly small and between the loud music and the conversations of other customers, my ears were ringing by the time I left.  The food is certainly worthwhile, though, and I think this may become one of my regular take out spots for lunch.

My husband and I had been to Enotria several times, which is probably several times too many in light of our recent discovery of the unscrupulous business practices of the owner of advertising specials and subsequently charging full price for what was advertised.  We had typically stopped in on Wednesdays, during which the advertised special as posted on the website is "Wednesdays - Ladies Night 5p-9p. Ladies get all wine by the glass for $5".  We each initially ordered a $10 glass of Barbera and when we finished our wine of which we would have been satisfied having a second glass, the owner talked us into getting two glasses of a Cabernet for $18 each.  The Cab was definitely not worth this price and I would have preferred the Barbera, but figuring that I'd be getting my glass for $5, I went along with his suggestion.  When the bill arrived, we were charged $5 for each glass of Barbera and full price for the Cabernet despite the fact that mine should have been $13 cheaper!  If the owner intends to limit which wines are $5 for Ladies Night, he certainly has the right to do so, however, when his advertisement clearly says "Ladies get all wine by the glass for $5", one would certainly expect him to honor the promotion that he created.  We've vowed never to return to this establishment as this behavior is a blatant indication that the owner does not value the customers.  We've previously ordered bottles of wine from the store and were spending on average $50-$80 per week at Enotria so while the owner may have made an extra few dollars of profit from us on that one occasion, it clearly was not a wise business decision in the long run, especially given the fact that there were typically few other customers present when we there, indicating that they are not overwhelmed with business.  Their wine selection is decent, which is the only redeeming factor that warranted giving Enotria more than a one star rating. However, as the other reviews point out, the food that they offer is take-out food from another restaurant and as such, we never bothered to order anything to eat as we don't go to a wine bar expecting to have such poor quality deli delivery food.  The bottom line is that there are far better wine bars to go to that actually value their customers and honor their advertised specials.

As far as Vietnamese food is concerned, this is by far the best that we've found in the Phoenix area.  We've tried a few different dishes, all of which were great, but judging by the quality of what we've gotten, it seems to be the kind of place where one could safely order just about anything on the menu and not be disappointed.    Our favorite items are the veggie spring rolls and the vegetarian Pho with tofu.  The spring rolls are made of tofu, cucumber, bean sprouts, and mint wrapped in rice paper.  The ingredients are so fresh and delicious and there's just the right amount of mint to add the necessary flavor to set these veggie spring rolls apart from so many others.  They're served with a peanut hoisin sauce and we like to add a bit of the red chili sauce to it to give it a bit of spice. The Pho (item P7 on the menu) is so flavorful and in addition to the rice noodles, has baby bok choy and broccoli in it.  It's served with a plate of bean sprouts, thai basil, cilantro, jalepenos, and lime and is some of the best Pho that we've ever had.    It's certainly telling that the restaurant is busy even when we go for a late lunch at 2pm.  If you're looking for excellent Vietnamese food, this is definitely a place that you shouldn't miss!

While it is a bit of a drive to get to Rare Earth, we've designated this as our preferred pizza and wine spot as it's well worth the trip.  This restaurant offers a quality that so many seem to lack: consistency.  The pizzas are always made with the same high quality ingredients, the crust is always the same crispy, thin crust that we love, and the salads are always made with the same fresh ingredients.  It seems that this is such a simple concept, yet so many restaurants, particularly pizza places, fail to realize the importance that customers place in knowing what they are getting when they order the same item on two different occasions.  We typically get the caesar salad and the margherita pizza with mushrooms, onions, and green peppers on it and both items are excellent.  Their selection of wines by the glass is a bit limited, but there are some drinkable options for both red and white wines.  The only suggestion that I have is that it would be nice if they were to extend their happy hour until 7pm rather than 6pm as it is nearly impossible for anyone who does not live or work in the immediate vicinity to take advantage of the happy hour pricing given the drive needed to get there.    The only real drawback is that during most of the times that we've been there on Saturday nights for the live music that is offered, it seems that families with small children tend to frequent the place and there is nearly always some loud, crying child that disrupts the otherwise relaxing environment, which is a particular pet peeve of mine.   The bottom line here, though, is that this is definitely a place worth trying out!

If slimy sandwiches and salads accompanied by rude staff completely lacking in personality are what you're looking for, than Gandolfo's is the place for you!  My husband and I had lunch at this location yesterday and I honestly still feel nauseated even thinking about it. Never having been to Gandolfo's, we needed a few minutes to look at the menu, which was certainly not a problem as there were no other customers in line.  This should have been our first warning sign but sadly, we persevered and ordered our lunch.  The girl behind the counter answered our questions with simple yes/no answers in a completely deadpan tone with no hint of an expression on her face.  My husband decided on the Madison Square Garden sandwich and I had the salad of the same variety.  I ordered a soda and my husband asked for a water.  The girl at the counter then asked him if he would like a cup for his water.  What a ridiculous question!!!  No, he doesn't need a cup, he'll just seal his lips around the soda machine and push the button!  After a bit of a wait, our food was ready and I brought it to our table, however, a better option would have been to throw it directly into the trashcan.  My husband unwrapped his sandwich to find it so heaped with mayo and sopped with oil that even the outside of the bread was saturated and slimy.  My salad also contained the marinated mushrooms that were in his sandwich, and while they sounded good, the taste and texture was sickening.  The lettuce was anything but fresh and the gelatinous Italian dressing made the whole thing even worse.  The croutons that were supposed to have come on my salad were nowhere to be found, but I didn't even bother asking for them as I'm sure they wouldn't have been enough to overcome the already offensive taste/texture combo that I was attempting to choke down.    As if the food itself wasn't already enough to send us running out the door never to return, we then had the pleasure of watching the girl "clean" the counter by flinging all of the food that was on it onto the floor into the area where customers stand to order.  I looked around to see if there was a mark drawn on the counter or wall anywhere so that when the food on the floor reaches that depth, one of the staff comes out to actually sweep it up but didn't see anything so I'm guessing that they just allow customer to wade through the food buildup throughout the day.  I honestly have no idea how this place is in business given the fact that there is a Jimmy John's accessible from the same parking lot. I'm guessing that the sparse crowd in Gandolfo's at noon on a weekday is a direct result of a far better option available within walking distance.  If the rest of my review hasn't been clear enough as to what my opinion of this place is, let me just add that if I were stranded on a deserted island for a month with nothing to eat and the rescue boat showed up and offered me food that came from Gandolfo's, I would throw it overboard only to have the sea life also choose to ignore it.

What happened to this place???  Sushi Brokers used to (when I say used to, I mean a few years ago) be our go-to sushi spot and has now gone downhill to the point that the sushi is not even edible anymore.  We stopped going there regularly but would stop in on occasion to see if there had been any improvement only to find even poorer quality sushi.     Our last experience there will definitely be the last time that we ever set foot into this place.  We ordered some yellowtail sushi and the lollipop, cowboy, and summer rolls, although we received a surfer roll instead of the summer.  None of the sushi was the slightest bit fresh and the shrimp dynamite that came on top of the surfer roll was filled with crunchy bits of tail and shells.  The lollipop roll, which used to be our favorite, tasted so fishy and disgusting that we couldn't even eat it and we left afraid that we would end up with food poisoning from the rotten fish.  I would rather eat sushi from a grocery store than Sushi Brokers (and I can't stand grocery store sushi!).  It really is a shame to see what used to be a good place turn into such an all around disaster. If you're looking to try a new sushi restaurant, you'd be better off at just about anywhere else than here.

Consistently disappointing summarizes our experiences here.  The chips and salsa (ask for hot salsa) and inferno sauce are the only positive factors at this restaurant.  My husband and I have ordered food here numerous times and each time leave shaking our heads wondering why we didn't learn from our past experiences at Inferno.  I'll summarize our most recent visit to provide an example.  I ordered a combination plate that was supposed to consist of a soft vegetarian taco and bean tostada with a side of rice and beans.  My husband also ordered a combination plate with a bean tostada and inquired as to what options were available for a burrito without meat.  The server pointed him to "Courtney's Favorite Burrito Inferno" that was on the menu and explained that the burrito had rice, black beans, cilantro, onions, etc. in it and that he could get "pretty much anything he wanted" in it and they would just omit the meat. When our meals arrived, my plate was missing the side of beans altogether and the taco was served with a hard shell.  When I asked to have the taco replaced with the soft shell that I ordered, my plate was swept away and reappeared about a minute later with a soft taco that was clearly simply the contents of the hard shell taco that had been scraped haphazardly into a tortilla.  As it turned out, the taco was actually the best part of the meal as it was nearly impossible to chew the greasy, leathery tostada shell that was sopped with refried beans and few if any other toppings.  My husband's plate contained the same lackluster tostada and had the appropriate sides of rice and beans.  As for the burrito, which according to the combination menu is supposed to be ten inches, what arrived was a six inch dried, cracked, and stale tortilla containing nothing but greasy sauteed onions and green peppers that I would assume are used for the fajitas.  The burrito was so flavorless and the ingredients so poor quality that he gave up on even trying to consume the majority of it.  Another consistent negative that we've observed about Inferno is the generally rude attitude of the bartenders who seem to be put out to have to make a margarita.  Once we do manage to get their attention after they continually walk past and ignore customers in need of drinks at the bar, a margarita is then sloppily thrown together and served in a glass that is only about 2/3 full.  It would appear that the staff's attitude is simply an extension of the owner's as we've seen Terry, who certainly recognizes us from Inferno and from his sister property Rhythm & Wine yet will not even greet us or most of the other customers, skulking around the restaurant rudely demanding that staff change the television channels as he stands around idly, seemingly wishing he were anywhere but at his restaurant.  All in all, this is a place to stop for some chips and salsa and nothing more.  The location is really the only reason that we've been to Inferno as often as we have and we certainly aren't in a hurry to return.

This restaurant is located close to my husband's office so we've met there for lunch a few times and actually wish that it was closer to where we live as we would certainly frequent this place.  We had the veggie spring rolls, which are very fresh and delicious.  Our favorite is also the vegetarian Pho which has broccoli, mushrooms, baby corn, and other veggies in addition to a generous portion of rice noodles and is served with the usual plate of bean sprouts, thai basil, cilantro, jalapenos, and lime.  We typically add tofu as well and all of the ingredients are very fresh and high quality.  Another nice aspect is that they offer both the traditional beef broth and a vegetable broth.  We've found the beef broth to be a bit more flavorful, but for those adhering to a vegan diet, the vegetable broth would still provide a flavorful option.  Another plus is that this restaurant also serves alcohol and offers a daily happy hour, so it would also make a nice dinner spot as the atmosphere is more tasteful than many Vietnamese restaurants.  If you're a fan of Pho, this is a place you'll want to check out.

It is with true sadness that I must note that tonight marks the end of an era for us.  Crust had been our go-to pizza place for longer than I can remember.  We easily spent $100+ per week at this location, not to mention attending wine dinners for an added cost.  The pizza was consistently good and the selection of Italian red wines was decent despite the fact that our beloved Barbera was recently removed from the list.    We arrived tonight at 8:30pm after rushing to get home from our respective long days at the office so that we would be sure to arrive a full 30 minutes before Crust's posted closing time of 9:00pm so as to avoid inconveniencing the staff by arriving too close to closing time.  We'd been looking forward to our usual Greek salad, 20" pizza which also would provide us with tomorrow's lunch, and our half-off bottle of wine consistent with their posted special on Mondays of 50% off bottles of wine.  Unfortunately for us, particularly given that this is not an overly convenient location relative to our home, we were immediately greeted by the female manager who announced that they were already closed because it was "really slow" (the pizza oven was already shut down) and that the kitchen staff had already gone home.  Really?!?!?!? It never ceases to amaze me how many businesses fail to realize that 90% of the challenge is getting a customer in the door in the first place and that it is regular customers who continually generate revenue that are the key to keeping the doors open.  Is it too much to ask that a business actually honor their posted business hours when regular customers make the decision to expend effort driving to your establishment to spend their money???  If a restaurant doesn't wish to be open unless some threshold level of business is being generated then why not simply post a sign that says "we're open as long as we're busy but don't rely on us to respect our regular customers enough to care if they're going out of their way to purchase our food during the period of time we've said we'll be open"?  I refuse to "beg" a restaurant to allow us to spend our money there.  Are we supposed to call before driving over during their normal business hours to find out if they are, in fact, going to extend us the privilege of being open and allowing customers to dine?  Sorry, that's more effort than we're willing to expend to patronize a business that can't even honor their posted hours, particularly on a night when they offer a special that is designed to bring customers in (see my review of Vito's Pizza & Italian Restaurant from July 2012 and I can definitively say that we have not been back there despite how convenient their location was for us).  Sadly, tonight's attempt at dining at Crust will be our last and we will find somewhere else to spend our hard-earned dollars that actually appreciates its customers' patronage.

This is one of our favorite places for healthy, flavorful food.  We love spicy food and the Vindaloo dipping sauce is a staple for us here as we add it to just about everything we order.  For appetizers, the lentil cake towers, seared tofu, and baked samosas are some of our favorites, although we've honestly never had anything here that we haven't liked.  The vegetable naan-wrap and veggie flatbread both have great flavor and as far as the entrees go, we've had numerous combinations of veggies, tofu, chickpeas, lentils, etc. with both the Vindaloo and hot curry sauces and all have been delicious.  Bombay Spice also has a good selection of inexpensive wines available for $20-$40 per bottle that complement the food well.  If this place was located a bit closer to our house, we'd be there even more often given how many vegetarian options they have to offer.

When I noticed that Andiamo Bistro was today's Living Social deal of the day, I actually would have felt guilty not posting a review to hopefully warn other Yelpers not to waste their money on a coupon as I had done in the past.  Even with a discount, this place is not worth trying.  We made a reservation and when we arrived, our table wasn't ready yet so we took a seat at the bar and ordered some wine.  The woman who waited on us (we later realized that she was the owner) began complaining about how busy she was and how she was dreading the upcoming weeks because so many people would be coming in with a Groupon coupon (Why did she offer this deal if she doesn't want customers?  It's not like Groupon put a gun to her head and made her advertise with them.).    We finally got seated and ordered the stuffed mushrooms.  After an unusually long wait, the mushrooms finally arrived.  We were absolutely starving and the lackluster mushrooms stuffed with a ball of sausage were definitely not what we were expecting.  There was nothing flavorful or even pleasant about this dish.  After another 20 minute wait, our house salads made their way out.   Nothing really to comment on here, just a typical salad with vinaigrette dressing.  Then after at least another half an hour, my lasagna and my husband's spaghetti pomodoro were finally served.  By this time we'd emptied our bottle of wine and had to resort to ordering something of lesser quality by the glass.  The lasagna was some of the most bland lasagna I've ever tasted.  There was almost no sauce so it consisted mainly of noodles, unseasoned ground beef, and a layer of low quality cheese.  I really couldn't believe that they would serve something like this at an Italian restaurant.  My husband's spaghetti pomodoro was equally as blasé.  It was really just a bowl of spaghetti pasta with a very meager amount of chopped tomato and garlic on top.  Again, an unacceptable entrée coming from an Italian restaurant.  When we finally managed to track down the owner so that we could get the check, we'd been at the restaurant for at least two hours due to the incredibly slow service.  I'd honestly rather eat at the Olive Garden (ewwwww...cheap chain restaurant "Italian" food) than ever come back to Andiamo.

I wholeheartedly agree with the other Yelpers who have expressed their shock at the positive reviews that Posh has gotten.  While I can't say that anything I had was bad, it certainly wasn't outstanding, excellent, or even slightly worth the $250 that the experience cost my husband and I who are really very adventurous diners (please see my reviews of Razz and ShinBay if you doubt that statement).   To begin with, the place was incredibly loud, actually to the point that we had to just about shout at each other to have any type of a conversation.  Once we crossed off the few items that we did not want included in our meal (this reverse sushi-style menu seemed bizarre at a place that bills itself as being improvisational and adventurous), it took a surprisingly long time for the kitchen to prepare the miniscule bites of food that we received with each of our 5+ courses.  We certainly weren't famished when we arrived, but were quite hungry by the time we left due to the lengthy duration of the meal and the time we'd been at the restaurant.  All totaled, the quantity of food that we each consumed would be about equivalent to what we would have had if we had each ordered a single maki roll at a sushi restaurant (I'm talking California or spicy tuna, not something fancy and fried here) and the meal cost over $250.  We left and went to another restaurant to actually eat dinner!!!  Despite the fact that it was such an expensive evening, at that point, it really was comical to think that anyone would actually return to such a place for another severely overpriced starvation meal.  I'm thinking this place may become the new dining hotspot with the supermodel "I only eat a piece of lettuce a day" crowd but they need not worry about trying to attract repeat business from those who are seeking a truly satisfying improvisational dining experience.

A great place to enjoy the patio for lunch or a $5 glass of wine before 6pm!  Obviously, the wines offered for $5 are not the best and highest priced ones from the regular menu, but it's still a great deal.  The small plates like hummus are a great snack to enjoy with the wine and we've had several flavorful sandwiches and salads for lunch there as well.  The staff is friendly and attentive and there seems to be a fair number of regular customers offering repeat business which generally seems to be a positive indicator.  Whenever we're dining anywhere in the Old Town area, this is a go-to place for us!

This review is based on the sushi portion of this restaurant so perhaps I would need to update this review if I ever return to Narai for the Thai portion of their menu, although, that will be highly doubtful as I interpret skunky, fishy tasting sushi to be indicative of the overall quality of everything that the restaurant serves.  We arrived at least ten minutes prior to the end of happy hour and ordered drinks.  I ordered a specialty martini which was supposed to be one of their signature drinks despite the fact that there was no one on staff who actually knew how to make it.  Due to the delay in making the drink, and therefore, the delay in ringing in the drink order, happy hour had ended and I was charged full price for my drink.  Strike one, but still looking forward to the food.  We attempted to ask for a vegetarian version of the spring rolls which are served fresh in rice paper and not fried.  The waitress told us that everything is pre-made and they could not make any that didn't already have the shrimp in them.  Okay, now that's just a bad sign.  Putting raw shrimp in with veggies and leaving it to sit?  That's a case of food poisoning just waiting to happen.  We obviously passed on the spring rolls and ordered some sushi, all of which was not in the slightest bit fresh and tasted very fishy.  We lucked out with the fact that they actually forgot to make one of the rolls and requested that they not fix the error and rather, simply bring us the check.  We left feeling rather nauseated by the whole experience and I can't think of any crazy, cataclysmic circumstances that would actually bring me back through the doors to try a second experience here.

After reading the other positive Yelp reviews about Traffic Jam, I decided that I had to try it out so I went in for lunch while I was getting some new tires next door at Discount Tire.  What a great find!  I was greeted by a friendly older lady behind the counter and when I inquired as to whether the tomato soup was creamy, rather than just giving me a yes or no answer, she immediately gave me a sample so that I could try it out.  It was absolutely delicious, not creamy at all and had tasty veggies in it.  I ordered a bowl and she told me to sit down and I could pay later as she immediately brought my soup to the table.  It was so good, I decided that I couldn't leave without trying something else, so I ordered the vegetable panini.  It was brought out to me on a tray with napkins, silverware and two Andes mints neatly placed alongside it.  The sandwich was really quite good and had artichokes, red peppers, and zucchini in it, which was delicious.  The menu had said that it had pesto on it as well and as it turned out, this was a pesto mayo which was rather heavily applied.  I'm not a big fan of mayo to begin with so next time, I'll just avoid that.  The sandwich was also served with a fresh dill pickle and a bag of chips, which is really quite a bit of food for $5.50.  I'll definitely be back for some more soup and to try out some other things on the menu!

Bland and lackluster food that is not worth the price or the wait to get it.  We had lunch at Nourish a few months ago and while we weren't overly impressed, as they do serve healthy food that is in line with our whole foods, plant-based eating habits, we decided to give them another shot and went for brunch a few weekends ago.  I ordered the egg sandwich, which is described as an air-fried egg, avocado, and tomato on a gluten free bagel with a side of sweet potato hash.  As I have never found gluten free bread products to be very mouth-watering, I asked to substitute multi-grain bread in place of the bagel, as the bread had previously been the best part of the lunch sandwich that I'd had.  The server informed me that they were out of bread (how does a restaurant run out of bread when half of their menu items are sandwiches? very poor planning by management) and that the only other item available was a wheat bun, which I opted for.  My husband ordered the veggie quiche, which is described as zucchini, asparagus, caramelized onion, parmesan, and a quinoa crust.   After an incredibly long wait (the restaurant was less than 1/3 full), our food finally arrived.  My egg sandwich was by far the most flavorless breakfast item I have ever consumed.  The air-fried egg had sounded appealing as it would be healthy and not greasy, which was the case, however I didn't realize that this also meant there would be absolutely no seasoning on it or flavor to it at all.  The sweet potato hash was downright disgusting and I only consumed a cube or two of the mushy, flavorless heap that was on my plate.  As bad as my meal was, my husband's veggie quiche definitely won the award for worst breakfast item ever tasted.  The "quinoa crust" which we were looking forward to as we love quinoa dishes, was actually undercooked quinoa mixed throughout the entire quiche with no visible crust present, which gave the whole thing a granular texture equivalent to fine gravel having been poured into the dish.  The vegetables almost appeared to be ground up as there was just an overall green appearance to the egg portion with no discernible pieces of the veggies described on the menu actually present.  The dish in general had a strange taste and the off-putting texture from the quinoa was more than I could handle even in just the one bite that I tasted.  I honestly don't know how my husband even managed to choke down the portion of the quiche that he did.  We also each had two bloody marys while we were there and while each took an incredibly long time to get, the first one was flavorful and seemed to be made "extra spicy" as we requested, however, the second one was flavorless and tasted like watered down tomato juice.  While Nourish has a nice patio and offers a view of the lush foliage present in the complex, these elements are not enough to bring us back after we left with our tastebuds reeling in horror over the flavors, or lack thereof, of our brunch.

Reservations are needed to sit at the bar?!?!?!  We attempted to stop in for a drink on the patio on May 29th and were surprised to find people sitting at the tables, but the entire outdoor portion of the bar empty except for a single person.  It turns out that the person sitting at the bar was a waitress who informed us as soon as we sat down that we were not allowed to sit there because she was saving the seats for the people "on the list".  I inquired as to what list this was and she told me that we would need to get on the waiting list if we didn't have a reservation.  At that point, I expected to hear Rod Serling's voice as I thought I had actually entered the Twilight Zone.  I mean, seriously, this is by no means a posh or swanky restaurant.  It is a casual restaurant that offers happy hour, at which no one in their right mind would think it necessary to wait on a list to sit at the bar.  We got up and went and sat at what I could only describe as a counter or ledge on the side of the patio at which we had sat the previous afternoon while we were having a glass of wine.  The red-haired manager promptly walked over and told us that we need to register and put our names on the list and could not sit there.  I asked what had happened since we didn't need to be on any list the day before, but he offered no explanation and rudely insisted that we register with the hostess.  Needless to say, we left and will not return.  The only halfway decent aspect of Renegade is their outdoor patio bar and if that is not usable without an undue hassle, there really is no reason to go there.  We had previously had dinner there and I honestly think that we could have gone to Denny's and gotten a better meal.  We each ordered a salad and the lobster tacos, which our server raved about and highly recommended.  The salad was made with iceberg lettuce and some other nondescript items that had seen fresher days, but the truly puzzling element was the red onion vinaigrette dressing which looked and tasted like nothing more than a combination of red food coloring and some sort of a gelatin.  As for the tacos, this is certainly not the type of place where one would expect high quality Maine lobster, so I was expecting some sort of mediocre warm water lobster.  That would have been a treat compared to the heavily breaded, greasy globs of what had to be cod or some other type of inexpensive whitefish as there was not even a hint of lobster taste present. The tacos themselves were sopping with a smoky flavored chipotle sauce and had a bit of shredded cabbage thrown in as an afterthought.  Needless to say, I didn't even finish half of that dish despite being very hungry when we'd arrived.  We had written the place off as a potential dinner destination after that horrific meal, but since we live fairly close by, thought we could still stop in for a drink, but clearly we were wrong on that front too. I truly can't see this place making it through the slow summer months if they continue to drive away business with their bizarre policy of making a reservation or registering on a list to sit at the bar.  One can only hope that their demise will be quick and a worthwhile restaurant will move in to take their place.

More like Jimmy Boo, big thumbs down to you!  The worst excuse for "Chinese" food I've ever had!  Key words here are: SALTY, GREASY, and FLAVORLESS.  My husband and I ate here for lunch and once was enough for us to write this place off as a total loss.  The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice and that's where the positive attributes end.    We started out with the veggie lettuce wraps then ordered from the lunch special menu in which the entrees include an egg roll and soup of the day.  The veggie lettuce wraps are described as "seasoned five spice tofu tossed in a savory vegetarian sauce."  What we got was anything but savory.  A heap of crumbled tofu was served on a plate and was soaked in some sort of sauce that had apparently had about a pound of salt added to it as that was the only predominant flavor.  After that disgusting mess, we opted to forego the egg rolls since we assumed that those would be greasy and salty too.  The soup of the day was some nondescript mix of mushrooms and vegetables, none of which were in large enough pieces to be identifiable and once again, the only flavor involved was that of salt.  I ordered the Kung Pao veggies and my husband ordered the Vegetable Delight.  When we ordered, the waitress asked us how spicy we'd like the dishes prepared and when we inquired as to how spicy their "spicy" dishes are, she assured us that our meals would be packing plenty of heat.  We may as well have each ordered the same entree as what arrived were two plates of greasy overcooked/undercooked veggies (it seemed that they just threw them in at random, not based on how long they would actually take to cook) in a completely flavorless sauce.  Neither dish had even a hint of spice to it and the veggies were of such poor quality that I only ate about one quarter of the meal.  Once I got back to the office, over the course of the afternoon, I think I consumed about a gallon of water because I was so thirsty from the loads of salt in everything.  A truly disgusting meal in every regard.

I think the high reviews of Sofrita must simply be a function of the limited dining options in Fountain Hills as this is the worst excuse for tapas that I've ever had.  We walked in and were greeted by a strange, musty smell that remained pervasive throughout the meal.  We should have taken that as an indication of what was to come and left, but based on the great reviews, decided to stay.  Big mistake.  I ordered a red sangria which was okay, but had a strange flavor of figs or dates so I'm not sure if it was just made with old wine that had turned and took on a prune juice flavor or if that taste was intentional.  We ordered the olives, fried potatoes, grilled zucchini, shisito peppers, and four different types of bruschetta.  The olives were, well, olives (tough to ruin those) but also contained some off-putting caperberries that we avoided.  The grilled zucchini was just plain zucchini with no seasoning whatsoever served with a side of what looked like potato salad as a dip, but we never really could identify what that substance was as it had absolutely no flavor so we opted to avoid the fat that it was obviously adding to the zucchini.  The shisito peppers had no spice or flavor at all and were absolutely swimming in oil.  I've never had a "roasted" pepper that was so soaked in grease.  The waitress asked if we didn't like the peppers when she noticed that all but a few remained and when we pointed out how greasy they were, politely took them off the bill.  The four pieces of bruschetta were all of different varieties: roasted eggplant; ripe tomatoes; avocado and beans; and grilled artichoke with cheese.  The bread was thick and chewy and none of the bruschettas had much flavor at all.  In fact, I think if I had just closed my eyes and randomly selected one off the plate, I probably wouldn't have been able to tell which it was.  The fried potato wedges were actually the best part of the meal, which is sad when the best item is a simple fried potato.  The atmosphere was severely lacking as there were candles on all of the tables and numerous votives on the walls, but not a single one was lit.  The restroom was extremely dark and was absolutely filled with unlit votive candles so I'm not sure if this was an attempt at saving costs, but had I known this, I would have gladly spared a box of votives from home just to create some sort of ambiance while we ate.  The place is also incredibly tiny so I have no idea where the flamenco band and dancers that other reviews have spoken of would perform.  If anyone tried to move through there, they would literally be bumping into tables.    While I love tapas style dining, if this were the only tapas restaurant that there was, I would gladly forego the experience.  Needless to say, we won't be back.

After one less than pleasing breakfast here, we won't be returning.  We started out with a couple of bloody marys which were made "extra spicy" as we requested and which were quite good, offering an interesting twist as they were made with cucumber vodka.  Had we ceased to order anything more, I may have wished to venture back to Tryst, but unfortunately, we did not quit while we were ahead.  We both ordered the Huevos Rancheros, which were described as having an Anaheim chile sauce.  What arrived was a plate covered in some sort of goo that tasted like cheap Velveeta cheese sauce that had been somehow modified to give it a filmy texture.  The sauce was absolutely flavorless and made the entire dish, including the tortilla chips, into a soggy mess.  While I don't often do this, the meal was so awful that I truly couldn't eat it and asked the server to take it away.  The manager promptly came over and offered to get me a substitute entree.  He left me with a menu and he and the remainder of the staff (there were not all that many servers working as the place is very small) seemed to disappear.  After 10 minutes, I was still waiting to place my order for my substitute breakfast.  By this time, my husband had finished the portion of his meal that he intended to eat, which was not all that much either, given that he's made the same mistake in ordering the huevos rancheros that I did.  I finally managed to flag down a server and ordered the veggie omelet which the server told me came with toast and gave me a choice of bread.  Twenty minutes later, my omelet arrived sans toast.  When I inquired about the toast the server looked confused and went to the kitchen where it apparently took another ten minutes to toast some bread.  The omelet itself was very disappointing as they had sauteed the vegetables in an excessive amount of grease and then cooked the egg separately so that the greasy veggies were simply set between the folded egg rather than being cooked into the omelet as normally done.  Additionally, a slice of unmelted cheddar cheese had been placed with the veggies.  Definitely one of the worst veggie omelets I have ever had.  With so many other restaurant options to choose from, there certainly is no reason to come to Tryst.

I really don't understand the mixed reviews of this place!  We stopped in tonight and had a great experience.  We started out with a couple orders of hamachi sushi that were some of the freshest that we've had in quite awhile.  The sushi chef was a very entertaining and funny man, he even pointed out, much to my husband's dismay, that the Kirin Ichiban beer that he was drinking (and loves) is actually made in the U.S. by Anheuser-Busch...needless to say, he will never order that beer again!  We than moved  on to the spicy tuna roll, which is made just with Sriracha and doesn't have any mayonnaise to mask the flavor of the fish.  We had a few more orders of hamachi and then ordered the "Snow White" roll, (a daily special) which was the spicy tuna roll with white tuna on top and garnished with a dab of Sriracha on top. It was excellent!  We then asked the sushi chef for his recommendation and he made us an order of albacore tuna sushi with a miso mustard sauce on it.  What an incredible presentation!  We immediately ordered another order.  Overall, the cuts of sushi were very meaty and everything was incredibly fresh.   The atmosphere was slightly lacking, but the sushi chef (owner) told us that he was in the process of ramping up and had already ordered a large fish tank to go on one wall and was planning to re-do the paper lanterns with hanging lights.  He also told us that he's been in the U.S. for 18 years now and finally has his own restaurant after starting out as a dish washer (kudos to him!) and that he can't believe how his competitors will serve day old fish.    I think we've found our new North Scottsdale go-to sushi place!

We stopped in for lunch a few Saturdays ago and were pleasantly surprised by the food and service that we received at what from the outside appears to be a fairly nondescript establishment.  My husband ordered a veggie wrap and I had the chicken taco salad and asked them to go light on the cheese and to substitute salsa in place of the chipotle dressing.  My salad arrived exactly as I had ordered it, the ingredients were fresh, and the salsa flavorful.  My husband's veggie wrap was also very tasty and had fresh ingredients and a soft, high quality tortilla.  We sat on the patio and the waiter was quick in refilling our drinks and providing service.  The chef is an incredibly nice guy and brought us some complimentary "granita", which is an Italian shaved ice made with fruit juice and no additional sugars.  He explained that this dessert is made by freezing the mixture in a pan and scraping the pan with a fork every 15 minutes to create the light, fluffy shaved ice texture.  The granita was so delicious, we would go back just for that!  I certainly hope that others will give Mumbles Place a try as this is a great little place that we really hope stays around.

We had a great dining experience here and will definitely be back to try out some of the other items on the menu.  We stopped in on a Tuesday night and despite the fact that the place was nowhere near full, the bar area seemed a bit loud so we asked to be seated on the other side of the restaurant where things were a bit quieter.  We started off with the lobster bisque, which is one of the better lobster bisques that I've had.  It wasn't overly creamy and the addition of sherry added a nice flavor.  It's certainly pleasing to find that there are in fact actual pieces of lobster in the bisque rather than just an overall seafood flavor.  For our entrees, I ordered the pasta trio which consisted of wild mushroom tortelli, spinach ricotta truffle ravioli and gnocchi with brie, asiago, and a brown butter sage sauce.  The tortelli was my favorite of the three items, however, all of them were made with high quality ingredients and were made in a true Italian style.  I would have preferred if the sauces were more flavorful, but even as is, the items were still good.  My husband had the eggplant torta with butternut squash ravioli and of course, I had to sample both items on his plate as well.  I really didn't care for the butternut squash ravioli as there was an overwhelming taste of brown sugar, but the eggplant torta was my favorite of anything we'd ordered.  It was served more as an eggplant lasagna than a typical torta and the flavors were excellent.  The eggplant was tender but not mushy and the sauce and cheeses were wonderful.    The service was excellent and the owner introduced himself and was very friendly throughout the meal.  The wine list also offered many good options at a variety of price points.  This place was a great find and we'll be back soon to enjoy more of the menu.

In one word, ShinBay is AMAZING!!!  Let me preface this review by saying that this is NOT a typical sushi bar, it is a gourmet Japanese restaurant, so if it's specialty sushi rolls that you're looking for, head to Geisha A Go Go or any of the other sushi spots that serve deep-fried, cream cheese laden, Americanized sushi as you will not find such fare here.  Rather, what you will find are some of the highest quality and most unique dishes that I can honestly say I've ever had paired with exceptional service.   We decided to sit at the sushi bar, at which the manager had graciously reserved us prime seating.  My husband and I opted for the seven course chef's tasting as we've found that this is usually the best way to get a feel for what a new restaurant has to offer.  The courses that we had are summarized as follows:  1.  Chilled asparagus soup - light and flavorful, left us looking forward to the courses ahead.  2.  Scorpionfish carpaccio - the fish itself as well as the sauce it was served in had excellent flavor, I could have eaten a whole plate of this as an entree.  3.  Sashimi sampler - a beautifully presented plate of six entirely different preparations of six different sashimis (including things we'd never had before such as giant clam and Japanese sea scallops), each having it's own unique flavors.  We watched this dish being prepared while we were consuming the first two courses and it took over 15 minutes just to prepare this one course.  The attention to detail and presentation was unbelievable!    4.  Steamed manilla clams with 5 types of Japanese mushrooms, served in their own broth - this dish actually derives its incredible flavor simply from steaming the clams and mushrooms together.  So delicious!  5.  Foie gras wrapped in halibut - this Japanese "fondue-style" dish was incredible!  Our waiter brought out bite sized pieces of foie gras wrapped in a thin piece of halibut and served on a pick with a variety of dipping sauces and then brought us each a wooden box which housed the flame that heated a paper-lined wire mesh basket containing sake and water in which we placed each skewer for approximately 30 seconds before eating.  The foie gras absolutely melted in my mouth!  6. Nigiri sushi - two separate plates (perhaps even two courses) of the highest quality Nigiri that I've ever had.  We inquired with the manager as to where the chef gets such high quality fish and were told that he has his fish flown in daily, which explains how such a small restaurant can have such amazingly fresh fish.  7.  Japanese egg custard with fresh fruit - light, fluffy, and the perfect end to a perfect meal.  We aren't typically "dessert people" and rarely order dessert at a restaurant, but this was delicious!  The chef's tasting that we had was $130 per person and without a doubt, was worth every penny.  We typically don't splurge quite that much when dining out and it would certainly be possible to order items a la carte and keep the cost to $50-$70 per person.    If you've read any of my other Yelp reviews, I think it's apparent that I do not gush about mediocre restaurants and am probably a bit harsher in my reviews than most are, but I can honestly say that if it were possible to give ShinBay six stars, I would.  We will be back soon and often.  I'm so glad that we found this gem!

Last night's attempt at dining at Vito's will be our last.  We had previously visited Vito's on a consistent basis (initially, at least once or twice per week) for drinks, appetizers, and/or dinner at the bar.  While the food is only of mediocre quality, the convenience offered by a location so close to home seemed to compensate for this factor as well as the cramped quarters at the bar and the seemingly perpetual presence of at least one or two loud, obnoxious patrons who repeatedly made their sojourns to the parking lot only to return reeking of cigarette smoke.  More recently, our visits became a bit less frequent due to the increasing filth present on the bar.  The last few times we visited, we entered to find only one or two patrons at the bar, but the entire rest of the bar occupied by other customers' dirty dishes that had not been cleared.  While the staff would quickly clear enough space for us to sit down, the dishes would be removed, but no effort was ever made to wipe away the food that was caked to the bar.  Glancing around, however, the reason for the staff's lack of attention to waiting on actual customers typically became readily apparent due to the presence of her Royal Majesty, the owner, perched in a prime booth with her entourage demanding the majority of the staff's time and efforts at the expense of the paying customers.  On numerous occasions, we sat with empty glasses for 10-15 minutes while the staff chatted with and tended to the owner and her royal court.  While the convenience factor allowed us to tolerate these issues, the failure of a restaurant to remain open during its posted hours is a fatal error.  We arrived to dine at Vito's last night only to be informed by the bartender that the restaurant had closed A FULL 45 MINUTES PRIOR TO THEIR POSTED TIME.  Customers rely on the hours that a business states that it will be open when making plans and a failure to remain open for business until such a time presents an inconvenience significant enough that we will not burden this establishment with our patronage again.  Vito's may not care about the time customers must waste driving to a different restaurant when they had planned on stopping in for a convenient meal, but I can assure them that we will not risk the aggravation of the time wasted on a Sunday evening with a long week of work looming on the horizon.  Bye, bye Vito's.  We won't miss you.

Our dining experience began with the hostess seating us and providing us with only a meagerly populated wine list. We perused the list, but having no idea what was on the menu, were not inclined to select a bottle of wine as we had no clue what we would be eating. I opted for a glass of mediocre Chianti for $12 and my husband ordered a draft of Peroni for $6. Our server hastily snatched the drink menu from our hands only to inform us that they were presently out of Peroni and brought a dark version of Moretti, as an alternative, which we later learned when the check came, cost $9, and my husband did not care to drink.  It is truly astounding that any restaurant, even in Scottsdale, charges $9 for a twelve ounce bottle of beer! This can be noted as rip-off #1.  Dinner menus finally arrived along with a basket containing four miniscule slices of low quality bread. Our server methodically rattled off the daily specials, one of which included a daily soup that, just like the entrees listed as specials, was accompanied by no description of what the item actually contained. We placed our orders and for lack of anything else to choose from, opted for a bottle of the Chianti that I had previously had. My husband ordered the Caesar salad, which was the only palatable item of our entire evening. I ordered the soup of the day after having asked for more clarification as to what it actually was. The server described it as an Italian wedding soup and highly recommended it over the pasta fagioli on the menu. I was delivered nothing even remotely similar to an Italian wedding soup, which typically contains vegetables and more importantly, has FLAVOR. I received a bowl of hot water that was chock full of cooked spinach with some nondescript and flavorless white items, which I can only assume were egg whites floating in it. The soup was so incredibly tasteless that if I were to have closed my eyes, other than the mushy, chewy texture of the cooked spinach, I would have had no clue what I was eating.   As we were consuming our first course, the hostess arrived at our table after locating the bottle of wine that we had ordered. She proceeded to engage in a physical war with the wine bottle in an attempt to open it, repeatedly telling us that it had been a long time since she'd had to open one of these and it was always very difficult for her to get this right. In her struggle to cut the foil from the bottle, she managed to violently shake the bottle in a vigorous manner, thereby ensuring that any sediment that had settled out of the wine was now once again suspended in the wine. This was confirmed when she poured the sediment-mixed liquid into our glasses. In her course of making conversation, she did ask how my soup was, to which I replied that it had no flavor. She graciously brought me the Caesar, which was quite good despite having the saltiest anchovies that I've ever tasted present on top of it.   Our entrees soon arrived, mine being the eggplant parmesan for $22 and my husband's being the "Linguine Malafemmena" for $27, which is described on the menu as "lobster, shrimp, scallops, mushrooms, garlic, white wine & fresh tomato". My entrée consisted of two thick, tough, bready, and greasy tasting slices of eggplant having a tasteless tomato sauce and half-melted slices of processed mozzarella on top, the entire mess seated on a bed of fresh-out-of-the-box spaghetti drenched in the same flavorless tomato sauce and accompanied by a limp side of overcooked carrots, zucchini, squash, and broccoli. The entire plate was at best lukewarm. The eggplant seemed as though it hadn't been heated throughout, which would explain the unmelted cheese on top. Note this as rip-off #2. That having been said, frighteningly, my entrée was the better of the two. My husband's seafood pasta dish, instead of having a white wine sauce, was drenched in a sickly, brown butter sauce, which we both despise and would not have ordered the entrée had it been described as such. The worst part, though, was the complete lack of lobster, which is noted as the first item in the description. We both mined through the dish to attempt to find anything that resembled lobster. The only item that we found was a tiny shred that measured approximately 14 of an inch by 1/8 of an inch in size, which we assumed (hopefully) was lobster. The only other seafood to be found in the dish was 2-3 shrimp of mediocre size and quality and one small scallop that had been cut into multiple pieces. Essentially, this was a $27 dish which consisted of a plate of pasta in an awful brown butter sauce with only the tiniest hint of seafood ingredients. Clearly, this was rip-off #3.  I truly cannot express what an incredibly disappointing and excessively costly dining experience this was. I've posted a photo of our itemized bill as evidence since I, personally, would find it difficult to believe that there are actually restaurants that charge $148 for a dinner as awful as this was.

I suspect this place is on the verge of going under and after today's experience, that would seem to be for good reason.  In the past, we've ordered the thin crust Meat Hater's pizza with the addition of black olives and found it to be a delicious, fresh mix of ingredients.  We've tried the veggie balls which were also great, but today made the mistake of ordering the Caesar salad as a starter.  Yikes!  What a disgusting and inedible mess!  We missed the notation on the menu that the lettuce was grilled, but nonetheless, taking a head of romaine, cutting it in half and pursuing to turn it into charcoal, topped with some stale croutons and a squeeze-bottle application of some "dressing" is an utterly disgusting combination.  We stopped after one bite.  Let's move on to the pizza.  It arrived with kalamata olives rather than the black olives that we had ordered.  Now maybe to some people, an olive is an olive, but these two types of olives have distinctly different flavors.  One belongs on a pizza, the other on a Greek salad.  When I asked our bartender/server, Alisha about this, she insisted these are the same olives they have always had. They certainly are not or we would not have ordered an item that we proceeded to pick off of the pizza due to it's off-putting taste.  Finally, she spoke with the "chef" who admitted that these are indeed different olives.  Really???  She politely took the inedible salad and olive upcharge off of our bill for which we were appreciative until we got home and assessed the half of the 16" pizza that she had crammed into a tiny to-go container.  In the past, we'd taken half of the pizza with us and brought it home in a normal pizza box.  This time, we arrived home and opened a tiny foil container to find a pile of wet, soggy goo.  Alisha had somehow managed to cram an entire half of a 16" pizza into a shallow, 8" round foil container by stacking and mashing the pizza into an inedible mass of slimy goo.  Needless to say, there are far better pizza places in Scottsdale that offer consistent food and responsible service.  We've never seen more than a handful of other patrons here at the most and this is likely why. There is no need to waste your money at this place and we certainly will not return.
