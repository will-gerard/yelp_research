Pros: food is pretty good.  Cons:  they rarely pick up the phone for to go orders. The one order we were able to place (after several tries) was messed up and we had to wait for them to fix it.    Terrible service, decent food.  You decide which is more important.  For me, there are plenty of better thai places in the area.

Pros: Authentic, Small, Friendly, Beer.  Cons: None.  This place does a great job on authentic Mexican food, which is pretty obvious from their menu.  Plenty of meats and veggies to choose from, as well as dishes like Lengua and menudo.  Plus, they have a few bottled beers to choose from.  Salsa is awesome, although the red may be too much for some sensitive types - no worries, they have a mild green which is also great.  I typically get a gigantic combo plate to go and eat half for lunch, half for dinner.  Also, a pretty good place for the kind of food that soaks up a hangover...  Service is prompt and gracious and they appreciate their customers.  Great place, plenty of parking, and no-nonsense food.

I just started working in the central phoenix area, and have to say that Cheese n stuff quickly became my favorite lunch stop around.   They use boar's head meats/cheese on their sandwiches and other quality ingredients in their sides.  The shop is small and quirky, and it's probably best as a carry-out location (they do have some tables inside, and although I've never seen all seats filled, I suppose that's a possibility).    Its reasonably priced, with a gigantic menu and selection.  Their breakfast sandwich is delicious, as is everything I've had for lunch.  In fact, on more than one occasion where I have gone for breakfast and lunch in the same day.  If you like sandwiches, and miss east coast deli's, this place is for you.

Consistently delicious.  They have a great weekend brunch/mimosas at a reasonable price.  Their short rib tacos are one of my favorite restaurant items in Phoenix.  Keep it up.

The Bloody Mary here is amazing, as is their whiskey sangria.    Food is good and pretty healthy, staff is pleasant and helpful, and they have live music occasionally on the weekends.   Ask the bartender what else is going on around the neighborhood, and they usually are plugged in enough to have some good ideas - make this your dinner stop if you're not from the area and looking to explore downtown that evening.  They'll point you in the right direction.

Pros: Rapid Reward program, no frivolous fees, bag check, website  Cons: DELAYS  According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, Southwest on-time performance departure statistics have gone from 80% on time in 2009, to 68% on time in 2014.  Translation, more than 30% of SW flights are delayed, with the average delay lasting at least 45 minutes. (transtats.bts.gov)  SW has been a good airline, but most of my flights in the past few months have been delayed.  I'm obviously not the only one.

Pros: Bruschetta, gluten free Bruschetta, $20 Bruschetta and bottle of wine Mon - Tues after 8pm, Great 1/2 sandwich and soup/salad deal for lunch.  Oh, and I should mention the Bruschetta.    Cons: Valet parking on occasion, can get busy and a little loud.    There's a reason that everyone loves this place, and you will too.  Go for lunch, get a good deal on food and $5 wine and beer before 5:00pm.  Go for dinner on Mon-Tues after 8:00pm and get a bottle of wine and a selection of bruschetta for $20.  I've been more than 30 times, have eaten everything on the menu, and its all delicious.  I can't say that for any other place, including grandma's.

Pros:  Excellent weekend happy hour, great sushi and sushi chef, attentive service, conveniently next to Total Wine.  Cons: None.  Bluewater is part of our weekend routine.  Sushi deals on happy hour are pretty good, and they have a few drinks for around $5.  Honestly the highest quality, least expensive sushi in the area.

I've had a lot of coffee, in a lot of places, and Lola is my all-time favorite.  I love their iced coffee, which is reasonably priced and has a single shot of espresso in it (cheaters).  Also their omelette bar is worth a shot on the weekends for a healthy brunch.    They usually rotate their art out once a month, supporting the local art scene, and keep lots of local event info around.  Background music is pretty good and non-intrusive, and there are always a few interesting folks around.    Usually stop by for an iced coffee on the weekend, then buy a bag of locally roasted beans to take home for work-day mornings.  Can't go wrong with the location, or their coffee.

Pros: Full bar, salsa bar  Cons: No bartender, watery salsas, poor service.  We visited this shop for a weekend lunch.  We were starving and didn't have a lot of time, so we opted to quickly sit at the bar.  We waited 5 minutes, and a server brought us chips.  We then went and picked out a few salsas from the salsa bar.  Out of the 4 salsas I tried, I liked none of them.  They were very thin and watery, and the plastic containers are smaller than the chips - so you can only dip the corner of a chip (but the salsa won't stick), and you can't pour the salsa onto a chip (because it will run off).  The only chips that sort of work are the 'defective' folded ones. I have no idea why everyone raves about the salsa bar, perhaps for the novelty of it, but chips don't work as a salsa-delivery vehicle for watery salsa.  After 10 minutes, we still did not have water, and 15 minutes into us sitting there, we apologized and left.  Their tacos may well be amazing, but we didn't have time to sit around.  Waiting for 15 minutes (literally) with no water delivery during an AZ summer should be criminal.  There appeared to only be 2 servers for the entire restaurant, and no bartender, and they clearly couldn't handle a lunchtime rush by themselves.  Luckily, there are many other excellent taco shops in the area.

Pros: Prompt and professional service  Cons: A bit pricey  Tri City was able to quickly fix my rare/odd brand washing machine (Asko).  The 2 techs were familiar with the machine, had the replacement part in their truck, and were done with the repair in about 45 minutes.  It was a little bit pricey, but they were able to come out within two days, and they were reliable and prompt.

Pros: Factory service and parts, they maintain your service history records  Cons: Somewhat expensive (no surprise)  I bought a used dodge 4x4 and took it into Chapman for a 70,000 mile service, as well as a later AC issue and battery.  It is no surprise that getting service done at the dealer comes at a price premium.  However, having first hand experience in a auto shop, there is something to be said for mechanics that repetitively work on the same types of cars and trucks.  You could take your car to a random shop with a cheaper hourly rate, but there is a high likelihood that the mechanic will not know the best process for removing and replacing parts.  Imagine a lot of pry bars and hammers.    Cars are like puzzles - I prefer the mechanic working on my car do the same puzzle every day.    Also, in the event you sell your car, Chapman will print out your service history, which arguably increases the resell value.

Pros: Drinks are good. Cons: Breakfast was cold (twice), and expensive.  We were early for a flight and stopped in for breakfast and a marg.  Breakfast came out cold.  We asked for them to pop the meals in the microwave for a minute, and would have been happy with that.  Instead, they remade the meals, which again came out cold.  By this point, we didn't have much time before our flight, so we ate some of the food, then left.  The manager was nice and apologetic, but nothing was comp'd and our meal with 2 drinks each cost about $75, not including tip.  This would never happen at the 16th street location - Frankly, ownership should be paying more attention to their chains, particularly at an airport where opinions can be formed quickly by locals and visitors alike.

Pros: Green Chili, Adovada, New Mexican, margaritas, salsa, bar seating.  Cons: Flex service can slow when busy, inconsistent hours/open times.  Los Dos is a great spot for spicy New Mexican food.  Keep in mind that New Mexican is different than Mexican - spicy with green chili either highlighting or supporting many dishes.  The flavor profile is similar, but not the same, which seems to throw off some of the reviews for this spot.  The food is excellent, and certainly representative of New Mexico.  Parking is pretty easy to negotiate, located behind the building via a narrow drive to the east side of the building.    When its really busy, service can be patchy - it seems they operate with minimal front staff.  You'll likely have different servers and runners stopping by throughout the course of your meal to check on you, if you need something, flag any of them instead of waiting for the person that took your order.  I doubt they assign specific servers to specific sections.  Also, I drove there several days after a holiday and they were closed, which was pretty annoying.  Their hours have been inconsistent for me in the past, sometimes closing early, or not open, and so on.  Overall, the food is excellent and a must-try in the area.  The food gets 5 stars.  The restaurant may be closed when you stop by, and the service may go either way, but its still worth a try.

Pros: Weekend happy hour deals, drinks, and BREAKFAST TACOS!!!  Cons: NONE  We go here almost every weekend now that they started offering breakfast tacos.  Eggs, little bits of jalapeno bacon, salsa in a corn tortilla = delicious!  Breakfast tacos are essential in Austin (and TX in general) and I've always wondered why all taco shops don't have them.  They also have cheap margs and a taco of the day for a couple bucks.  Two of us were able to have drinks, 6 breakfast tacos (they are street taco size) for about $20.  They also did a good job on the building, with big vaulted ceilings, and church-ie decor.    John at the bar is always helpful and happy, and the rest of the staff are professional and polite.  Good job z tejas and co.

Excellent rotating beer list.  Every time I'm in, there's something new and delicious on tap.  Happy hour food specials are great, tacos are delicious, and burgers are delicious as always.  Happy Dillon is back in the kitchen!

We wanted to go as a group for happy hour, due to the phenomenal reviews on yelp.  We showed up with 6 people, walked in and were all shocked.  This place is super small.  Tiny, in fact.   In total I would be surprised if it sat more than 20 people.    Additionally, due to the small size of the place, it was incredibly loud.  Needless to say, we couldn't stay to experience the food and drinks, because there was just no room for us.    This would be a place to go at an odd hour, by yourself or with one other person max.  It's much too small for groups, and parking is confusing and/or unavailable for more than one car.

Pros:  Food, service, price.  Cons: Smaller sized restaurant (may be occasional waits), parking (park across the street - see parking section below).  The food here is amazing.  I had the Tacu Tacu Con Lomo Saltado, which is rice and beans topped with strips of marinated sirloin steak.  The rice must be cooked in a small cast iron skillet and flipped over, because it has a seriously delicious exterior with a slight crunch.  The beans and lomo saltado are equally excellent.  Portion sizes are large, and they have a small selection of wine.  Really delicious and highly recommend.    Parking: After business hours (ie: 6:00pm) you can park either across 7th street at the auto shop, or across Virginia street, just south of El Chullo, in the parking lot behind the 3 story building (Techniprint).

Pros: Drinks and Decor  Cons: Expensive, very long wait times, inattentive and condescending staff.  Two of us went last Saturday evening to meet friends and the hostess told us the wait was 1 hour and 45 minutes.  Our friends were already inside and came out to get us, but the hostess wasn't happy about it.  We probably wouldn't have gotten in if our friends hadn't already racked up a large tab.  Hostess said something about fire code only allowing 125 total people in the bar, which may or may not be true.  The cocktails are pricey, but pretty good.  The decor and building are excellent.    Overall, expect to be treated like you're at the front door of an overrated Scottsdale club (all that's missing is the red rope), which is very a-typical for the downtown area and won't be put up with for long.  Long unnecessary wait times and condescending staff also don't help.  I won't be going back for a while until they crowds and hype die down and they start getting desperate for business.

Pros: Another great option downtown, great local beer selection, full bar.  Cons: Not many gluten free options (if you're into that kind of thing)  Happy for another great option in downtown phoenix.  Prices are reasonable, there's something on the menu for everyone (try the Mac n cheese), and the bar is big and U shaped, like all bars should be.    Thanks to the bartenders for consistently providing great service!

Pros: $3 margaritas, awesome nachos, great service!  Cons: None.  So glad that this excellent space was taken over by an area-appropriate hang out spot.  Paz has some of the best nachos around, my weakness.  Good selection of street style tacos, and good drinks.  The house marg is a great deal, and although the bar is small, they have a couple TVs playing random music videos or the occasional game.  Great place to plop down for an easy weekend brunch if running around downtown.  Parking:  You park kind of behind and to the side of the building.  The parking lot entrance is an immediate right off of 3rd st just north of Roosevelt after the traffic light; 3rd street is a one-way street heading north.  Or, if you want to act like a local, turn north on 5th street off Roosevelt and take the first narrow little left, which will lead you to the same lot.  Thanks to the staff, and to DJ who made us fans on our first visit!

This is the worst meal I've ever paid for.  The hash was boiled potatoes, the breakfast sandwich is on a disgusting biscuit, the Bloody Mary was basically straight tomato juice, and the fried guac was inedible. I live down the street and I wouldn't go back if they paid me.  You have to pay up front, otherwise I wouldn't have.
