I have been going to Salon Boulevard for several years now. I have seen a stylist, a nail tech, and the aesthetician (facials and waxing) and I absolutely love the laid back, relaxed atmosphere! Misty is the stylist I see and she's one of the best I've ever been to, but she makes my hair look so good in the salon that I can't duplicate it myself at home (dangit!)  Mikel is the nail tech I see and she has many clients that have been seeing her for years (including me). Shannon is the aesthetician and does a FABULOUS wax!! I would recommend this salon to anyone!

This is one of my favorite places. I've never had anything here that wasn't wonderful - from breakfast to lunch! They have salads and sandwiches, but not burgers. The staff is always great and it's always busy (there's a reason).

I would give it 0 stars if I could. I've been dealing with these folks for just under a year now and they're grossly incompetent. My list of issues/incidents is too much to list here, but I can summarize by saying that only one encounter out of the dozens I've had with them has gone smoothly. They can barely handle making appointments. The docs are "so-so" as well, but the office staff is unbelievable.

This is our second time here and we are both very impressed. Tonight we tried the "loaded fries". Three pounds of yumminess. Fries, shredded beef, beans, jalapeños, green onions and ranch drizzled all over the top. Freakin' awesome. Enough for 3 people unless one of you can stuff yourselves. The mint chocolate chip ice cream cookie is amazing as well!!!

A friend of mine exposed me to this place (never even knew it was there!) and I absolutely love it! I love avocado so I had to try the spring rolls and I'm absolutely hooked! I probably get those to go once a week. Everything else I've tried has been AH-MAZING and I'm starting to wonder if they put crack in the food (jk). Really, it's a great place, very reasonable prices and everything I've tried so far is delicious! Good pieces of meat and great sauces. Definitely my new favorite place.

We bought 5 pounds of pulled pork and 5 pounds of brisket for a party and they were wonderful!! We found this place because of good reviews and now we can't wait to eat there! They provided rolls (slider size) and 3 BBQ sauces - ghost, sweet, and original. All were yummy! Everyone at the party seemed to enjoy it and even with 30 people there was enough leftover for 2-3 meals. Perfect!!  Even reheated, the brisket was tender and moist (without adding sauce!!)
