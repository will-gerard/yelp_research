As a local resident of Chandler, AZ...we had to choose this hotel one night when our A/C went out. We have known about Dobson Ranch Inn for years and always viewed it as a really nice hotel.    After staying here I would say it's "just okay".  Check in was very fast. I guess it helps if you've already pre-paid via hotels.com.  We were given an upstairs room for just two of us. I would have preferred a downstairs room to save on having to climb the stairs. It seemed like a slow night, so I'm not sure why we got stuck upstairs.    The room was okay...nothing spectacular. I've seen better in a non-resort room. Oh and why does this hotel claim to be a resort. I didn't find anything resort like about it? Bathroom had a slight funky odor of musty, mildewy, could be urine smell about it. I was not liking that too much.  Central air was just okay....seemed to take a while to cool the room off.  There was no indication in any of the hotel literature that there was any internet access via your room. I ended up having to call the front desk where he informed me that the little box under the alarm is a cable modem and you have to plug it in. Kind of old school I thought, and they should probably upgrade to wireless access.  One thing that I thought was kind of weird is that there was a bag of grocery store bought grapes and a full beer sitting on the steps leading up to our room.  We figured either someone had been sitting there eating/drinking or they dropped them there and forgot about it. At any rate, I had seen several employees walking around both the night of and the morning of our stay and when we got up to go to breakfast around 9:30 am that stuff was still sitting there and attracting bugs and flies. Hmmm. I probably would not book a room here again or tell my family to stay there unless the price was REALLY good.

We had a $50 giftcard for this restaurant so decided to check it out one evening.  We were seated immediately and first impression of the restaurant was that it was  cozy and comfortable.  A server came to a table pretty quickly and took our cocktail order.  Pricing on the drinks was rather high for the size of the drink that you get.  After looking at the menu I thought even the prices for the food was a little much for what you get.  Most of the plates do not even include a salad... It's pretty much a meat, a vegetable side for about $25-30.    After we placed our order the server took off to submit the order to the cooks and within 2 minutes she returned to inform me that they were "out of" the item I had selected.  I always hate that, just when you think you're gonna try something really good, they tell you that they don't have it.  I then selected my 2nd choice item but wasn't as thrilled with getting that as I was with my first choice.  The side was supposed to be asparagus.  When my plate came I had green beans on my plate.  I asked the server, "I thought this dish came with asparagus?"  She said, "Oh yeah, they were out of asparagus so they substituted green beans.  Sorry but green beans are not an acceptable substitute for asparagus and went terrible with what I had ordered.  Chicken was way over cooked and terrible, not worth the $26 price.   Other things I noticed: They must have had the heat cranked up to go along with the 2 fireplaces that were burning inside. It was way too hot in there and it was cold outside.   The server informed us that if she goes missing it's because she's trying not to hover and that if we need anything we can ask another server if she's not around?!  I've never heard a server tell me that....  Most likely will never go back. It's just one of those places that you go, "yeah seen it, ate there, won't be back."  Nothing impressed me and the food was terrible.

I have stayed in A LOT of hotels and this hotel was AWESOME for the price. Booked on priceline.com and requested a 2 and a half star hotel and ended up with SpringHill Suites in Chandler.  1st thing when I walked into the room was how CLEAN it smelled and looked. It looks like a brand new room. The carpeting was nice and I thought really plush for a hotel. The decor was kind of wild but I loved it.    There were all kinds of freebies up by the front desk. Free coffee, hot chocolate, hot tea, water, an apple, cookies, newspaper and on top of all that FREE BREAKFAST in the morning. I honestly think this hotel should be rated at least as a 3 star hotel if not more. I stayed in a 3 star Courtyard by Marriott just 2 nights ago and this one blows that one away.  Pool is kind of small, but I didn't stay here for the pool. Everything was in working order in pool area. Jacuzzi was clean and nicely hot...jets worked great. Hotel is very quiet..and I stayed in a room facing the street.  You will not be sorry if you stay at this hotel. I'm not easily impressed, and this one impressed me.

Von Hanson's has been in my neighborhood for a good 5 years that I know of. I don't go there very often because, 1. I am not that big of a meat eater and 2. because it is kind of pricey in there.  Recently I became very aware of GMO's in our food and the whole Monsanto situation. I decided that from now on I will only buy grass fed beef because we don't know if the cows that are corn fed, are being fed with GMO corn. Most likely they are because it would be VERY expensive to feed them organic corn. However, I felt like Von Hanson's would surely have grass fed beef right? So I happily made my way on over to VH's. I selected the cut I wanted, and as the butcher was taking it out of the cooler..I asked him if any of the meat was grass fed. I guess I was assuming he was going to tell me that it was grass fed..Unfortunately, he told me that NO...ALL of their meats are corn fed.   I left with my cut of meat, but I still felt a little disappointed that they didn't have ANY grass fed meat there.   Von Hanson's...if you can respond and let us know if your beef is fed GMO free corn...I will change my rating and update my review. Until then, sadly, ...I willl not be back.

Looked online to find something new to try and came up with Verona Chophouse.  The front desk does take reservations so I figured since it was a Friday night I would go ahead and make one.  Upon arriving the restaurant was not busy at all, so reservations were not necessary but it's a good option to have just in case.  We were seated immediately.  The hostess tried to give us a table with chairs and I asked if we could have one of those big white comfy-looking booths instead so she obliged.  Within 3 minutes someone arrived with water and hot bread and butter.  As we were looking at the menu and perusing the wine list, the waiter appeared and helped us with our drink order.  They did not have the wine I selected off the wine list, so I opted for the house Cabernet...which was really good!  The bread and butter were a perfect start.  The bread was delicious and the butter was whipped and soft, not that butter in the gold packets that  is cold.  Once I had that, I knew that the rest of the dinner was going to be great.  I ordered the garlic roasted chicken, which comes on whipped garlic potatoes with an au jus gravy and cippolini onions.  YUM...It was sooooo tasty. I loved every minute of it. Great flavor and perfect sized portions.  The dinner also came with a choice of soup or salad.  For the soup they had Manhattan style clam chowder.  It was good but I think I still prefer the New England style.  The salad had big chunks of bacon with blue cheese crumbles.  Comes with a vinaigrette but I opted for ranch instead.  I was very satisfied with the quality of food. Part of me worried that the food may still be "casino style"....but it really was nothing like that.  I actually thought it was better than some of the steak houses around Chandler that aren't in casinos. Pricing was a bit above average...but $42 for everything still wasn't that bad, and that included the wine.   Service was great...it did seem to take longer than normal to get our entree, but the wine and the bread, soup and salad kept us busy and allowed for conversation between plates.  I had read all the reviews here before I even went to this restaurant, but I'm glad I didn't listen to the bad reviews and not go. I will definitely go back again. This is a great place to celebrate for an adult dinner, a romantic date, an anniversary, or just to go out with friends or family.  Our waiter was Thomas and he did a great job.  Thanks Verona Chophouse!

We decided to try this place for the first time. It was just okay. Hash browns came out cold. Corned beef hash was terrible. Potatoes were crunchy and it had zero flavor. Drinks were never refilled even though server came back to check on us a couple of times. I probably won't go back until I see an improvement on food and service.
