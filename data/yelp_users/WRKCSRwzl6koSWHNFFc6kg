Overcooked pasta, check. Slopped on sauce. Check. Average garlic bread. Check. Crowds of families thinking it's fab. Whatever.     Look people, al dente and toss the Alfredo on the noodle. It's not all bad, but if I want to go shabby chic and chow with the family it's okay. Not my deal, though. I like Italian served in sexy dark corners of the room with my honey.

I love this place. You can get anything here! Gifts, food, and a large selection of beers and wines. I never get what I came for and leave because there's always a great deal or item you don't think you can live without.

Great place. Really nice suites and attentive service.The food is pretty good, and location is fab. If you like luxury or being pampered, Phoenician is one of the places in Scottsdale for it. Why four stars? Tell the staff not one credit card, dollar bill or comment comes from below my neck. Hello! Put me on a pit with an apple why don't you? The guy I was with wanted to kill somebody. Respect your guests people.

No way, I get to bust the cherry with the first review! Phoenix Yelpers, hello???    The scenery rocks from the patio. Intimate wine room for a happening get together. Cool bar when you first come in the door. The dining room is open with a fire pit in the middle. There are way too many places trying to be Scottsdale or the New Sedona, but this place keeps its Southwestern roots.     Dishes that rock the house. Lobster tortilla soup with cilantro creme, yowza! Try something different with your nachos, pan roasted ahi & crab with white cheese and mango salsa. The chili lime pork tenderloin is another fave, with sun dried fruit salsa and green chili mac & cheese that kinda screwed up my world. Why have plain jane when you can have her hot cousin Lupe?
