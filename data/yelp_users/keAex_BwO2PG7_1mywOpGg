Pleasantly surprised. Legitimate NY Pizza in Arizona. Great crust, delicious sauce, tasty cheese and perfect texture. Great spot to frequent if you are a local, or if just visiting. I'm originally from NJ and know good pizza. Only reason not 5 stars is because their prices for a slice are slightly absurd ($4.00/slice). In the most expensive city in the world, in Times Square, pizza is $3 - $3.50 a slice..

Great value. Beautiful rooms, comfy beds and great price for 5 star service. Pretty good location on the strip. This hotel has it all and is actually the world's largest hotel. Slots pay well. There are great restaurants and clubs/bars/pools. I wish the Casino had a better ventilation system as the smoke sticks to you in 5 minutes. All in all very pleased with my stay here and will be returning.

This hotel would be one of the greatest value finds in history except for the wreak of the smoke and little ventilation throughout the lobby and casino floor. I am currently staying here for a 5 day convention and I'm on day 2 and have some of the worst nose and eye issues going on. Even though I'm taking ample allergy medicine, the stuffiness and poor ventilation of this casino is killing me. All other casinos, even though they permit smoking, do not smell anything close to Imperial Palace. It feels like you enter a jungle with the humidity and lack of oxygen once entering the hotel from the monorail. Extremely stuffy warm, and you can almost feel the invisible cloud of smoke hovering above you. I really wanted to be wearing one of those masks the people in China wear. My clothes wreak of smoke and I have to shower before I go out again after walking through the casino each time.   The lighting inside the rooms is poor with 3 small table lamps and there's only 2 extra sockets total for your computer or cell phone charger. The in-wall A/C blows nice and cool which is a great and also helps to filter out some of the outside noise since it has a pleasant hum.  On a positive note, the price of the rooms are super cheap and if they found a way to clean up the terrible smoke smell and improve the ventilation this could be one of the best deals in down. It's proximity is A+ right by Harrahs and the Flamingo, but because of the nasty smoke, if I ever come to Vegas again I will not stay here.   Service and staff is very friendly and accommodating and they have cheap entry table games.

Delicious Lobster Gnocchi. Great Ambiance. Great tasting bread with unique garlic butter and sun dried tomato spread. Good service. Large food plates. Overall a great experience.

Very disappointed. Lame 'tricks', not really mesmerizing stunts or illusions. A waste of 30 minutes of the show was a very odd story about an alien and his dad. David and the audience curse often and I'm not sure how this is a 5 years old and up act. Random participants are clearly staged beforehand. The whole show is boring and feels like maybe he's been doing this too long and it's time to retire. If you're older than 20 years old and are a thinker/intelligent, I don't think you can really enjoy this show.

Very friendly staff and even though busy, they found a way to fit me in on short notice during my recent trip to Scottsdale. Very reasonably priced and Paul the Owner/Stylist is very personable and pays attention to the details. He took his time cutting my hair and I never had that knot in my stomach feeling you can sometimes get when trying someone new. Highly recommended.

Over Rated. I was very disappointed, especially since Adam of Man Vs. Food recommended this joint haha. Anyway- the server we had was so rude and un-helpful. She acted like she didn't want to be there and it was clearly too early in the morning for her to be awake and working. She never brought out our waters until after the food was served. While the portions are certainly HUGE, the taste was just blah. I've had way better pancakes, eggs, and bacon at many other restaurants before. I honestly would've rather ate at IHOP or Denny's than this place.

Awesome Hotel & Casino. Very modern and trendy. Did well on craps and Willy Wonka slots here. Younger 20-40 year old crowd. Cool club and pool. Good location on the strip. A flashy/upscale trendy spot for chilling at the bar, gambling, dining, lounging, clubbing and pool laxin'.

Hip, Modern, Trendy, Posh, Exclusive, Delicious, Expensive. Great restaurant but very pricey. If you have the money and want to woo a date or have a really fun night with a group of friends, this is one of the best hot spots in Vegas. Great food, decent portions, but on the higher 4 $$$$ range.

Amazing buffet. Probably the best buffet I've been to hands down. Good price, huge array of food choices, delicious, meticulously prepared plates. Clean. Busy. All in all a must try restaurant in Vegas.

Unimpressed. The food was salty and pretty bad tasting. The only good thing about this place is that it's in the best hotel/casino in Vegas - Cosmo. So after you taste one plate you can quickly bounce out to any of the other restaurants which are all better - such as STK, Scarpatta or other. I would avoid this place - expensive and gross food with stale bread that I played table hockey with while I waited for the yucky food. Very disappointed that this is in the Cosmo, b/c everything else in this hotel is absolutely a 5 star experience, where Jaleo is 'Meh' at best.

Probably my favorite club in Las Vegas. There is plenty of room both inside and outside on the pool deck to walk around and mingle. Unlike some clubs in Vegas (Hakkasan, Omnia), here at Marquee it's much easier to meet people and get social. The employees - bartenders, cocktails and bouncers are all relatively friendly here too. I can't stand the clubs where they load up on VIP tables and unless you drop $1,000, you can't have a fun time hanging out with the 'general public'. Well if you get annoyed with clubs like that then you need to give Marquee a try. A very solid venue that is a lot of fun and there are tons of good looking people that hang out here and in the hotel where it's located - The Cosmopolitan (best hotel on the strip).

Very modernized glass showers and typical super comfy Marriott bed. I stay in a hotel over 80 nights a year and this Marriott had the BEST cooks of any Courtyard ever. The buffalo wings and chicken quesadillas were so good that I just sat in the lobby all day and did work and ordered them 2x lol. Very friendly service here and I bet in the summer their pool is happening. Nice social vibe to their lobby/lounge area. Good hotel.

Best Burger to ever touch my mouth haha. Expertly prepared hamburgers that will make you squeal with joy. My taste buds were rejoicing even 4 hours after my scrumptious meal. Must try the 'Hell's Kitchen Burger' and sweet potato fries. Thank me later.

Really cool place, great location & delicious cheeseburgers! I really enjoyed my Bacon Blue cheeseburger here. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Scottsdale!

SLS Las Vegas is like taking a hot date out for the night who wears a gorgeous dress and heels but forgets to do her hair and put on her makeup lol. I was impressed with some things - the odd but cool decor of the room, the comfortable bed, amazing glass shower with 2 heads and the restaurants inside the hotel/casino. However, I was mostly underwhelmed with the overall experience in staying here for 2 nights. The the hallway carpets had stains on them. The casino is pretty corny/small. The ventilation system doesn't work well because the casino and hallways wreaked like smoke with a nasty cover-up perfume that was so strong designed to mask the scent, but made the smell even more intolerable. The general population who stayed here seemed to be minorities and foreigners. The pool is very nice but not enough lounge chairs and too many old people (although it was a weekday). I would not stay here again because it feels like they did a half-butt job of remodeling this place and there are much better options in Vegas and much closer to the action (SLS is way up on the north end). The only logistical benefit was that even though the hotel is far away, it was right next to the tram station so you could go up and down the strip relatively easily. I would not stay here again, however I would return to eat at Katsuya.

Save your money and sanity and go elsewhere. I have spent over $15,000 with this company the last 4 years and this last year their service and reliability has gone WAY down hill. I had not 1, but 2 bad batches of 30,000 brochures (over $4,000 worth of inventory). They would not make it right and get me a re-print or partial credit for the extreme inconvenience (delay for my business, time lost, labor of picking up and hauling 600 lbs of 30 boxes to the trash, etc).   I can not recommend Overnight Prints to my worst enemy. While their prices are certainly one of the best in the business, their service level, attention to detail and reliability is completely shot. You never know what you'll get when ordering from them. This last time they printed the brochures way too dark and the fold of the tri-fold brochure was backwards (the inside was on the outside).  The worst part of my ordeal is that their 'VIP Customer' line rings and rings and no one ever picks up, so I just sat on the hold cue on the phone for over 1 hour to get some run-a-round generic response from one of their lemming customer service associates. They will not go above and beyond to fix things and basically make it like it's your problem, order was delivered, now just deal with it.  If your time, money and stress levels are important to you, do not purchase from Overnight Prints.

Probably the best sushi I ever had. Come during their 'social hour' which I believe is 4pm-7pm or so. The prices that time are incredible: $9 for specialty rolls that are normally $22 any other time of the night! A real value during this happy hour time. All the rolls I ordered were delicious and I highly recommend Katsuya whether going with friends, family or a date; the food is impressive.

Awesome food but a little pricey. Some of the best eggs benedict and chocolate pancakes I ever had. Yum. Definitely a great spot for breakfast and I also heard their sandwiches are delicious. I would give this place a try if you're in the area. Nice selection of food and everything on the menu sounded good.

One of the hippest hotels I ever stayed at. Great customer service and an AMAZING resort pool. The rooms are a bit old and quirky but it's cool. Very Miami Vice feeling with the bright colors here. I dig it!
