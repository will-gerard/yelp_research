Omg. Omg. Omg. That's really my first words when I explain this place to other people. I have tried 6 different entree items and none of them have disappointed me! My favorite will have to be the half Chicken! Sooooo good and juicy! Plus you can see them roasting in the fire place when you walk in! I will also say the Kettle Chili Pork is so scrumptious! I've been craving it ever since! Those are definite must haves if you have never been. Did I mention the prices are extremely reasonable? Walking in, I thought this place was going to be really expensive but I was really surprised to see that the prices are very reasonable! Definitely a must try place and perfect place to go for date night. Also something to note is that they have happy hour every weeknight until 10pm (I might be wrong on that time but it ends late!) during the summer. You're welcome ;)

No wonder why this place has bad reviews. We only went because of the mechanical bull but it was broken. Then I get my drink and when I start to sip on it I see there is a fly so when I try to go take it back the bartender claims that it must have somehow gotten in my drink inbetween the 30 seconds (10 ft walk) from obtaining my drink and refused to remake the drink. I had even given a decent tip. Ugh what a disappointment... I will never go back.

We had booked with Seth to DJ our wedding and his wife began labor about 72 hours before our wedding so Shem took over. At first we were a bit nervous because were so impressed with Seth but Shem did a GREAT job. He kept our guests entertained and welcomed requests. He made sure we were ok with an inappropriate song before playing it since there were children present. He conducted the shoe game and everyone loved it! He played all genres of music,  new and old. Overall the feedback from our guests was that it was a really fun wedding and that is exactly what we wanted! Our wedding wouldn't have been nearly as fun without him!

I'm so incredibly happy this place opened up near me. I honestly had low expectations because I'm from Los Angeles. The minute we walked in a friendly waiter was there to greet us with a smiling face and a cheerful attitude. He said we could sit wherever we want. We sat down and I already knew what I wanted to order because we'll, I always order the rare beef steak pho when I go to a pho restaurant. It came out so quickly! The first thing that I do when I try any kind of fun is to take a spoonful of the broth to taste it. To my surprise it was really good! I mean, not just Arizona good but all around good and even better than some of my go to places in Westminster! I always say that good pho is when you don't need to do anything to the broth to make it taste good and that is definitely the case here! I've made it a point to make a weekly rotation at this restaurant and I really hope they do well and stick around because I will be a customer for life!  Ps. They usually only have one guy waiting on patrons so be patient when getting your check. :)
