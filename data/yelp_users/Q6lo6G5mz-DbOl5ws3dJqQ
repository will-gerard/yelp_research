Eh...  Came here because my companion's company was having some sort of party to end a convention thing. Waiters were walking around with trays of food and I was starving so I spent the bulk of the beginning of the night stalking waiters, trying to get food. The food was decent but nothing special. I had a few mini burgers, skewered fish, and some other unmemorable stuff. I couldn't partake in the chicken sate because I'm allergic to peanuts (but that's my own fault). There was an open bar for the party so I took advantage, pounding some diet cuba libres (rum and coke) and tao-tinis (dunno what goes into this drink but it is powerful and delicious). We took a little trip out onto the balcony but it was way too hot, so we snapped a couple pictures and then it was right back into the much-needed air conditioned area.  There was plenty of seating, little private booths with tables as well as a bunch of U-shaped and L-shaped sofas in the bar area. The music was decent. The DJ played a lot of mainstream stuff (and stuff that I find is too overplayed). A few of us were trying to convince him to play some house or electronic music but he was a coward who was afraid that his crowd would lose interest in the music and deem him a bad DJ. He did drop a few of my favorites later in the night, so I'll give him credit for that.  Anyway, once the club was opened to the general public, it got nuts. It was so freaking crowded, I hated it. I got spilled on multiple times, not even by sloppy people, but the sheer volume of people rendered it impossible to hold a glass without spraying the contents all over innocent bystanders. The party people had booked a private spot on the balcony, which was nice, but that got messy too because drunk people do NOT know how to NOT spill (double negative meaning, drunk people spill all over the place). I mean, granted, it's a club, not a museum, and of course, it's Vegas, but c'mon people. Let's have at least an ounce of class and grace.  Worst part of the crowdedness was the bathroom situation. Boys are lucky because boys pee quickly and there's good turnover in the male restroom. Sucks to be a girl because instead of one large female restroom, there were 5 or 6 individual bathrooms with a toilet and sink. It was cool at first because the doors have that special fog stuff where you can see through the door when it's open, but as soon as you close it, it fogs up and gives you privacy. However, once the line started to get long, it was horrible. And of course, all chicks take a thousand years in the bathroom because they have to pee, wipe, wash hands, check makeup, check hair, make sure their outfit is still in tact, etc. I wish they had an express line or something; like a bathroom without a mirror for people who just wanna get in, do their business, and get out.  I can't comment on the pricing because I didn't pay for anything all night but I can't imagine that this place is cheap. Boys, prepare your wallets, and girls, pump up the charm to score some free drinks.  All in all, it was a v. two-sided experience. Fun at first, disastrous at the end.

Yum!  Can anyone say anything bad about In-N-Out?  I had my usual, cheeseburger animal style and fries, with a big pile of the hot pickled peppers. The service was quick and luckily we got there early because shortly after we got our food, a huge line formed and people were hovering, waiting for tables to open up.  The food was delicious, as usual, and I'm crying now, wishing we had an In-N-Out in the tristate area.  The best part of this location is how friendly the staff are. Maybe I'm just used to my east coast coldness but I guess everyone in AZ is just super nice and not in that creepy midwesterner way but just a genuine happy niceness.

Yum!  Came here for dinner whilst on vacation. Cute place with a bar area and then more extensive seating for the restaurant area. Our party of 3 ordered an appetizer of kobe beef (super super pricey! our waitress had to inform us that the actual price was even more expensive than what was listed on the menu) and I wanted yellowtail so we got the hamachi sashimi tiradito. The kobe was really tender and delicious; we got to cook it on a hot rock ourselves. It came with an assortment of sauces and oils and salts, but my preference was just to dip it in the sesame oil before cooking it and then getting a few grains of the black rock salt to stick to the edge of the meat before eating it. The tiradito was yummy too. It came with a tangy spicy, ginger-y sauce (that was also given to us with the kobe) and was topped with little red jalepeno slices (and since I love spicy foods, that was awesome to me).  For main entr√©es, we ordered the chef special sushi platter and asked to make sure they gave us the 'yamato' as one of the rolls (which is really fancy with foie gras and tuna and caviar and gold leaf). We also ordered the 'bobo brazil' which contains kobe beef and chimichurri (one of my favorite sauces) amongst other things, and the 'rainbow dragon' which had a wasabi pea crust on it, which made the texture really interesting (in a good way).  To go with our meal, we also ordered several different kinds of sake. We ended up having the manager (who is an avid sake enthusiast and has been to Japan many times to find delicious sake for the restaurant) help us out with choosing the right sake to go with our dishes. We started off with an unfiltered, super fruity, sweet sake which I fell in love with. I'm not a big fan of sake usually, but this one was really good. The other ones we tried were all pretty good too (light and I could barely taste the alcohol) but they were all overshadowed by the first one we had.  Since we had already racked up a pretty extensive bill with all the food that we ordered, we decided to splurge on a little dessert too. I ordered the 'carmen miranda' which is just seasonal fruits with a little cake and yuzu sorbet. The sorbet was tart and refreshing and a nice way to end the meal (like a palette cleanser and breath saver! haha). Someone else ordered the warm chocolate banana cake. Our server told us it was the most popular dessert but warned us that it was super rich and heavy. It came out in a huge flying saucer shaped dish with a tiny dip in the middle to hold the dessert. I didn't taste it but it definitely smelled and looked amazing and the guy who ordered it seemed to enjoy it.  Oh! And the highlight of the night was when the DJ started playing some Fedde le Grand tracks!! GAWD. A meal encompasses not only the food, but the ambiance, and that was perfect for me. (The DJ was set up in a really accessible location, so I'm sure you could go and request stuff if the music you're hearing isn't adding to your meal).

Yay!  This is a nice, clean hotel in a convenient location. There are several eateries and museums nearby (which we unfortunately did not have time for) and the airport is only a 10 minute drive away.  The hotel offers a shuttle service, which will take you anywhere in a 3-mile radius and you can also call to arrange a pickup. I thought that was a nice touch.  The staff are kind and friendly (though it seems like everyone in AZ is this way; or maybe it's just me being used to NYC coldness viewing common courtesy as overt niceness).  The beds are quite comfortable, the rooms are pretty spacious, and I like that there's a fridge and microwave in the room.

Yum!  My friend and I were in AZ for a long weekend and we were spending our last evening in Phoenix before flying out early the next morning. We'd had our fill of Mexican food so we were perusing Yelp for some help. Unfortunately, many places are closed on Sundays so we were pretty limited on where to eat, especially because we didn't want to have to drive v. far.  We ended up at Nobuo at Yelp's suggestion, after deciding that we wanted sushi. Unfortunately, this wasn't quite the sushi bar we were expecting. Fortunately, neither of us was that hungry so the small portions didn't bother us much.  We chose five dishes to share between the two of us and it was mildly satisfying. I don't recommend going here if you're feeling ravenous unless you're willing to spend a small fortune. Each dish is only about 4 bites and ranges from $18 to $30.  We had the yellowtail ceviche, tuna tataki with beet puree, shiromi carpaccio, tako and tomato, and the pork belly. The fish was incredibly fresh and the preparation was v. balanced with the appropriate amount of acidity, salt, and umami flavors. The shiromi carpaccio was drizzled with a hot chili oil at the table, which partially cooked the fish; we loved the chili oil so much, we wished we could ask for some to douse the other dishes with. The tako was tender and the tomato used in the dish was perfectly ripe. The pork belly was nice and tender and served on a bed of deliciously seasoned rice.  It was a surprisingly yummy meal with incredible presentation and lovely ambiance. I'd say this is definitely more of a special occasion place.

Yay!  My friend and I were visiting AZ for a weekend and we met up with some locals who suggested Valley Bar for some libations.  This is a cute little place. It's a bit difficult to find (you have to go to the back of the building and then walk down a flight of stairs) but that's part of its charm.  I love the display above the bar with the animated shadows and the ambiance is comfortable but also kind of hipster-y chic.  I had their classic margarita, which was made with fresh lime juice. It was well-made; there was no gut-punching boozy bite and instead it was nice and smooth with a good balance of sweet and citrus.  The food menu looked pretty good; maybe next time.
