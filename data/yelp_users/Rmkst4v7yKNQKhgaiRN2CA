We came for my son's Birthday (my son's favorite place). We seated quickly .Out waitress was Shayna please ask for her she was great! My asked for anything she was on top of all our needs. As a former waitress myself  I understand the difficulty of customers happy! She was sweet with my kids and professional with me. So if you do get a chance to come here please ask for Shayna. Thanks again The old Spaghetti factory.

Came in to wash my car and the gentleman were very helpful guiding me to the correct wash I needed. As a woman I sometimes feel uncomfortable coming into a car wash as I always feel they are always to sell me things I don't need . Thanks cobblestone for making this a good visit will be telling my girlfriends to come to cobblestone to wash there cars.

We came in for a family Birthday.. So looking forward to the southern cooking.  Let's start off in when getting there we wanted to sit out side but we could not because as stated by hostess there was a large party outside and there was not a server who could really take care of us. We ordered green fired green tomatoes for a appetizers in which we never received. Our dinner came out cold which we hope could have loved to have been fixed but our server did not come back to check on us till 20 min later.  We ordered more drinks which we never received. Over all we can sadly say we do not plan to come back!

Never ever go here it started off my directions and the lovey person who answered the phone extremely rude. I was taking my husband for a nice shave and haircut but it never happened! When we arrived the person was to busy texting to say hello! Then after standing there for a min  or two she asked if we had a appointment minding you the place is completely empty. After telling her our info she got on the phone to do personal business. We never felt welcomed we left

We can in for my Mother's Birthday lunch. This was our 2nd visit here. The first time we came in the service was not so great but we did sit in the corner and maybe they did not see us very well. This visit was so much better our order was put in quickly and our waters were refilled without us waving anyone down.
