We ate here a couple of times. We liked their pizza, wings, and tiramisu. However, the customer service is terrible. Thought I would give them another try, thinking that maybe they just had an off day, not the case! Unfortunately, the quality of the food doesn't make up for the lack of good customer service so we won't be returning again.

This location is in a very busy spot and trying to find parking is the biggest headache. The store itself doesn't offer as much as other Michaels locations. After visiting a couple other locations during Christmas (Paradise Valley and Glendale), I saw how much this one lacks. They didn't have entire sections the other locations offer. The customer service isn't good either. I wish that for the hassle of parking alone they would offer more. Especially since it is a popular location. I would rather drive up to Paradise Valley than go here.

Went here to try the highly recommended wine burger. It was too greasy for my liking and I thought it tasted average, nothing you can't get at any other burger place. The place itself is very dark inside. They did have good drink specials but it's not somewhere I'll return.

I drive by the sign for this place almost everyday and have been wanting to see how it is. It's kind of hard to find since it's located near office buildings. We went for lunch and they were setting up for a live band (we didn't stay long enough to see them play but they sounded good when they were testing).   I ordered the Duckling since it was one of their signature sandwiches and it sounded good. I was looking forward to the smoked duck, but I was disappointed. The cranberry sauce completely overpowered the meat so that's all I could taste. I don't mind cranberries, but it felt more like I was eating a jelly sandwich because it was too sweet. I could only finish half my sandwich and tossed the rest. I loved the outdoor patio and the fact that they're dog friendly, but the food didn't cut it for me.

I love the happy hour menu here. All the times we have been here, we always stick to the happy hour menu since the options are delicious! Their buffalo wings, hummus and cheese sticks are my favorite! A great place with a "dive bar" feel to it.

I go to Trader Joes often and the staff is always friendly and helpful!  You can't beat their wine and cheese prices!

After moving to this area, I started looking up local dentists to switch to. My sister recommended this one since she has been going here for a while and she loved it. As soon as I sat down, I could see that they had great relationships with their clients. Everyone was super friendly and welcoming! I love my hygienist, Katie! She was extremely friendly and kind. She even recommended places to eat since I'm fairly new to the area (one of which I did already try and absolutely loved). Dr. Woodbury was just as friendly! It felt more like walking into a family business and I loved it! Thank you guys and I'm glad to have chosen them!

My favorite restaurant! The pizza here is always delicious! The ingredients and bread all just work so well; their bread is especially my favorite! I've tried all the pizzas at least once but my favorite is the simple, yet classic, margherita pizza. Their lattes are also delicious!   The service could be better in terms of friendliness. They all seem pretty uptight and serious but the food is more than worth it :).

This was my first visit to Copper Star. I was looking for a local coffee shop that offers drive thru service. I saw that Copper Star had great reviews so I thought I'd check it out. I went in early Sunday morning and once I pulled up to the drive thru, I was greeted by a young lady who was very nice and extremely helpful! They didn't have any type of menu outside, being that this was my first time, I wanted to see what they had to offer beyond the regular latte or cappuccino I always order.  I let her know I'd never been before so she gave me a rundown of their specialty drinks (she was extremely nice about it, not annoyed like some people at other places tend to be). That's when I heard her say Lavender Mocha, lavender syrup made in house, and my eyes went wide! I haven't had a lavender mocha since my many trips to my fave local shop in Seattle so of course I had to order it.  Did not disappoint! I loved loved their lavender mocha! I also asked for pastries, which she then preceded to tell me that since it was my first time, I get a free one. Woohoo!!! I ordered the blueberry scone which was fresh and ginormous! It was very delicious! All-in-all, this was the perfect visit with delicious coffee, a delicious scone, and great customer service. I will absolutely be coming back, only next time, I'll bring some friends along to try my new favorite local coffee shop!

I absolutely love Joe's! Best burger I've had in Arizona. I always order the Fontina burger with the garlic fries. Soooo amazing. I also enjoy all the outdoor space, as does my dog :). Be warned, the line can get very long and out the door. It's worth the wait!

This is my neighborhood target location. It's a super target so I can get my grocery shopping and other necessities done at the same time which is very convenient! I also go to their optical department and everyone there is great too.   Even though they can get pretty busy, they keep plenty of registers open so I have never had to wait in a long line. As long as you don't mind the construction constantly going on with the light rail, this is a great target!

My friend's rehearsal dinner was held here in one of their private rooms (with our own restroom which was a happy bonus!). We had a party of slightly over 20 people with 1 waitress; however, I must say that she did a great job and handled the big party well! She kept the drinks coming all night and was on top of all our requests.  When we arrived, they had chips and salsa already set throughout the tables. The salsa was decent, not spicy at all (I do have to say that as a Mexican, what I find "not spicy" my fiancé will think is hot). One thing I will suggest that I had never realized was a "thing" was to request flour tortilla chips instead of the traditional corn that they bring you. A friend requested them and let me sample, and they were much better than the corn chips! (I must've been living under a rock) For my entrée I ordered a beef chimichanga. The chimi was not fried at all, it was more like a burrito smothered in the sauce (which didn't have a good flavor) so I didn't eat very much of it. The rice and beans were not great either but after trying the chimi, I hadn't expected them to be. Overall, we had great service but the food wasn't very good.

We were on our way home from north Phoenix so we were looking for the nearest Harkins to see Deadpool. This one is right off the freeway on its own; surprisingly not in a big shopping center, as most movie theaters are. The service was great, everyone was friendly. We went the 2nd weekend the movie was out on a Sunday afternoon so there wasn't much of a crowd (which we prefer). The movie was great and the Harkins was too! Definitely a good location I would go to again!

Love love love this place! I was introduced to their wonderful breakfast many years ago when my brother-in-law lived nearby. I was instantly hooked on their chicken fried steak; and after bringing my fiancé to try it, he was too! The service has always been nice and they keep things quick. The portion sizes are huge! They do sometimes get very generous with the gravy on the chicken fried steak so be sure to ask for lite gravy if you're not that big of a fan. Definitely stop by this restaurant if you're looking for a great breakfast or lunch!

Love love love the bruschetta! Best I've had here in Arizona. If possible, go during their wine/bruschetta deal nights on Mondays and Tuesdays. You can get an order of bruschetta and bottle of wine for $20! Can't beat that! The bruschetta is more than filling. My personal favorites are the prosciutto, burrata, and salami.

Went to the salon for color and trim. This was my first visit but the place was recommended to me. They also have a Yelp voucher deal so I couldn't pass it up! I really liked my stylist, Janelle. She gave me great tips and her confidence and knowledge made me feel at ease with the darker color I was going in for.   She did an amazing job and she's super friendly! I had a great time there and everyone was very nice. I usually feel the time passing by at salons when I go in for a color; but this visit, I definitely did not. The price is kinda high for what I am used to but that won't stop me from going back. Great salon!

Great seafood! I had the calamari for appetizer and Barramundi as an entree, both were very good. I liked that they had more variations to offer, other than the typical salmon, mahi mahi, etc that you usually see in the desert. Average prices for seafood and this is a restaurant I will come back to often!

This was my first time going here; we went to see Tom Segura on a Friday night. He was great, loved his stand-up! The venue was another story. Our party had 4 couples and two of the couples arrived early to get seats since it's general admission. When we arrived, we were told that we wouldn't be able to save seats for the other 2 couples so we had to wait for them to arrive. I didn't understand that rule since half of us were there and we all had tickets so we would be seated no matter what. My second issue was the temperature. It was absolutely FREEZING! The waitress kept saying that it would get hot once the show started but it never did. Several other people complained about the temp but it was never adjusted. My third complaint was the uncomfortable seats and long tables. The seats were typical restaurant chairs which doesn't go well when we're sitting for hours. Also, the way the tables are set up don't work when someone taller than you is next to you because you won't be able to see much. Our waitress was wonderful, she did great, just wish everything else had gone well. I hope that in the future, they change the seating and make it more comfortable for their customers.

I love their barbacoa burrito! We go to this location often. I've had their chicken tacos and salads but the burrito is my favorite. They keep their ingredients fresh and stocked well so I've never had the issue of them being out of something I want.   There was only one incident when I went, a couple months ago, where the employee who was making my food kept getting distracted and talking to someone in line behind me that she knew. Their customer service has gotten better since and when we last visited, about a week ago, the manager and other employee were awesome!

I love TJ Maxx! This is the closest location to me so I am here often. You can't beat their prices on most items they offer. Their women's clothing department is great and it does seem to get updated often. The men's department, not so much. Their shoes is where they lack terribly. Their selection is very minimal and very outdated. I also love their inventory on accessories. If you're looking for stuff for the home, you won't find much here. You're better off going to Home Goods. Overall, great store!

We wanted to try something new today so we decided to stop in at Potbelly. I ordered the smoked ham with hot peppers, lettuce, and tomatoes. It was very tasty! They did add a little too many peppers so next time I'll be sure to say "lite peppers." I also ordered a strawberry banana smoothie which I absolutely loved! They were nice enough to blend the two as a custom order for us. The customer service was great! We were in and out (it was too early for a dinner rush but too late for lunch). At the checkout counter I decided to grab an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. It was ok, the chocolate chips were kind of overwhelming. All-in-all the food was great!

This is the closest Nordstrom Rack to me but it's my least favorite. The customer service is bad and I don't like their selections in handbags or shoes. I would rather drive to another, better location.

I have been wanting to try this place since it opened and when my dental hygienist told me to go because she loved it, I finally decided to stop by. I'm not too big on eggs so I went with their lunch sandwich. I got the #20; which is turkey, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, and cheese. It was delicious! I devoured it! The way the sandwiches look reminded me of the frozen PB & J's we used to get in school. It's sealed along the sides and stuffed with goodness. Loved it! The place itself is small but they do also have outdoor seating. The customer service was great! Also, if you check-in while you're there, they offer a 10% discount! Give this place a try, you'll love it!

I walked past this shop and wanted to see if they had any recommendations for food for my dog. He just turned 8 so I figured it was time to switch him over to a senior type of dry dog food. My pup has a very sensitive stomach so choosing food and treats for him is always something I do carefully. The employee there was extremely helpful and nice! He answered all my questions and seemed very knowledgeable on all the items in his store. The brands he recommended, I had seen had received great reviews online when I was doing my research at home. He made me feel at ease with the brand that I chose and was very patient with us.  I have always stuck to Petsmart or other big chains for the convenience; however, no employee at any location has ever been as helpful as here. They don't really know much about the items they sell, they are just your average retail employees.  While shopping here, he also gave me a sample of treats to have my pup try and promised that he would love them. Got home and gave him one, he devoured it! He came running to me for more! Thank you! Give this place a try, you won't regret it!

We tried this place out for the first time for dinner. We sat outside, which was nice because the plaza has string lights, making it a romantic/pretty setting. We started off with the pork belly brûlée, which was delicious! The house mustard sauce made the dish! The brûlée added a twist to a traditional pork dish but the mustard/orange zest brought it all together. Must try!  I wasn't too hungry (we went late at night) so I just ordered the margherita. It was ok/not very good. I can't say it was terrible because it wasn't, but I wouldn't ever order that again. I didn't care for the taste of the bread and the cheese tasted like something you'd get at a chuck-e-cheese. However, I'm giving this restaurant a 4 because (well, for one, the service was fantastic and the ambience was great) but mainly because my brother ordered the Chicken Marsala, which he let me try, and it was AMAZING! They got the flavor absolutely right! I honestly can't say enough about it! We all kept eating his plate because it was soooooo great! I'm already salivating at the thought of it. I was actually very bummed I didn't think to order it because I kept wanting more, but didn't want to devour a plate that wasn't mine :).  We also ordered dessert (CHECK IN because YOU GET A FREE DESSERT!), I ordered the tiramisu but they ordered the chocolate lava cake. The tiramisu was ok. *Disclaimer* this is my favorite dessert so I try it everywhere I go that offers it, across multiple countries, so I tend to be extremely picky about it :). The chocolate lava cake was good. Overall, it was a wonderful evening and the food was delicious. I would highly recommend the pork belly brûlée and Chicken Marsala! Don't stick to the simple choice of pizza!

I love these outlets because they have more stores than most outlets in and around Phoenix. I love that they have a Kate Spade and Asics footwear outlet! They have some pretty great deals at many of the stores (Asics had buy one get one free on clearance shoes, with a good variety of shoes and sizes). I've never tried any of the food court options but they do have a Starbucks right in the center.

Stopped by this place for lunch with friends. The service was good and friendly. I was in the mood for a burger so I went with the Lariat with Cajun fries. It was very good! The portion sizes are more than enough and the Cajun fries are the best! The meat was cooked perfectly; and any burger that has bacon in it is a win :)! I did also sample the Mac n cheese and that was pretty good also. I wish I would've saved room for dessert because they sounded great but I guess I'll leave that for the next time around. I would recommend the burgers and Cajun fries!

Our family wanted to hang out, play games with the kids on Saturday so we decided to meet at this park. It's very big and right off the 202 on Dobson. There's plenty of parking and room to play games. They have a unique playground, including a splash pad and some kind of jungle gym-like structure that kids can climb. There's some shaded benches around the play area but not as much as there should be, considering the size of the place. They do have restrooms right by the play area so that's convenient. This park also has a big pond where you can fish at. They host events here also so it can get pretty busy but it's definitely a great park that everyone can enjoy. Just be sure to bring chairs in case you don't get there in time to grab a bench! Like most parks, the shaded areas get booked for birthday parties so I would suggest getting there early, before most kid parties start (around noon and on).

Great flavors! It isn't the typical ice cream shop but the flavors are excellent. I'm used to always ordering mint chocolate chip, the mint chip here is very good but it's white. They always make sure to ask if you've tried the mint chip so that you are aware this isn't your average mint chip ice cream. The sundaes are very tasty!

Great place! I had their gyro pita with fries and it was all very good! The meat was cooked perfectly and had a great flavor! The tzatziki sauce was on the side but the pita was perfect without it. They did cut the tomatoes into bigger pieces which I didn't care for too much, but the overall flavor was perfect. Can't wait to stop by again!

Loved this place! Went for the first time to have lunch and instantly loved the atmosphere. There is plenty of outdoor seating options and the inside is just as nice. We had the cauliflower as an appetizer and it was so flavorful! As an entree I had the salmon sandwich and it was good but nothing extraordinary. I did try my sister's crispy  tofu and I actually liked that dish better, it was very good! Where they fell short on was the service. It took us a while to get our drinks (2 glasses of wine and a beer). Other than that the place was great and I will definitely be returning soon!

We went here last night after hearing people talk about this new local place. It's pretty nice inside with a big bar area and indoor/outdoor seating. There are arcades in the front room but most are in the back room. I will say that I got pretty hot being in the back room playing so I hope they add some air conditioning or something more to cool it down since there are no windows in that area. I can only imagine how stuffy it will get in the summer months. The arcades were free which is awesome, so long as you actually get a chance to play. We got there around 6:30 and stayed until about 9:30. At about 7, there were lines to play some of the more popular games so if you're looking to mainly play, I would suggest getting there early. They don't offer food; however, they do have a French fries food truck that showed up around 8 (I would suggest not spending your money on them because they weren't that great). The parking right by the bar is limited but being in downtown, you can park at the meters all around. All-in-all, great bar with a nice atmosphere and a good mix of people.

I have been excited to try this new place in my neighborhood. I finally went a month after it opened for happy hour. Everything tasted great! We had calamari, bruschetta, shrimp and they were all delicious! I especially loved the bacon wrapped chicken on the happy hour menu. My only complaint would be that they did not offer a single glass of wine (not sangria) on the happy hour menu. I figured with the name of "Cor Tapas and Wine" I would at least have one option of red and/or white but I didn't :(. I will definitely go back because everything was very good! Hopefully next time I'll see some glasses of wine for happy hour!

Stopped by here for a gel manicure. I was seen right away (it was midday on a Thursday so it wasn't busy). She did a great job on the manicure and she was very friendly! (I can't remember her name :( ). The prices are pretty average, $27 for the gel manicure. Give this place a try!

I had been wanting to try this new local restaurant because all the reviews were great. We went on a weekday around 4 and we had the place completely to ourselves. I ordered one cochinita pibil taco and the carne asada torta. The cochinita was absolutely delicious! I loved it! Next time I will request that they put the sauce on the side because they were very generous with it and I didn't think it needed it. The meat alone would be just as great. The torta was ok. I could only finish half of it. I don't like mayo but this was a mixed mayo spread so I had thought it would be ok. The mayo flavor was still pretty overpowering so it just didn't sit well with me. I'm sure if I had requested the torta without the spread, it would've been perfect.  We decided to have the buñuelos for dessert but they weren't good. The customer service was fantastic and the food was great. I would recommend the cochinita tacos! Also, if you check in you get 10% off so that's always nice!

I have been waiting months for this place to finally open because I've always heard great things about it. It did not disappoint. I got there right before they opened as I knew there would be a line (sure enough there was). They handed us menus while we waited and offered water while sitting, waiting for my food. Great customer service! I ordered the SmokeShack and regular fries (want to try the cheese fries and concretes next time). The burger was absolutely delicious!! The cheese was perfectly melted, the peppers were an added pop of flavor and the bacon of course was just great. I would have liked some lettuce added and the buns to be more toasted but I know to request it next time. I'm usually not a fan of crinkle cut fries (reminds me of elementary school) but these were very good. I imagine the cheese fries will be just amazing. I can't wait to return and try a concrete also! I love that they serve beer and wine as well as offering chicken. Great place, great service, great food. They have plenty of space indoors and outdoors and have long wooden tables to fit many guests. Must try! Thank you Shake Shack for coming to Phoenix!!

I took my parents here for breakfast because of all the great reviews. This intersection has a lot of construction going on so just be prepared for that. I parked at the meter (which is to be expected in downtown) but I didn't see any nearby parking lots. The shop has windows all around which makes it feel very open. The decor is industrial (loved it) and they have plenty of seating inside.  I ordered a latte (no flavors added) and the rocky point wrap (if I'm not mistaken on the name but it was amazing!). The wrap had black beans, egg, avocado, cheese, and salsa; the flavor was perfect! I also tried my mom's yogurt bowl and that too was pretty amazing.  They're still fairly new and working out the kinks but this was a wonderful choice for breakfast. I do have a couple of suggestions :) - provide napkins (maybe next to sugar/water station) and keep an eye out on the food orders (ours sat for a few minutes while they were talking). Other than that, great place and I can't wait to go back!

Loved My Slice of the Pie Pizzeria! We ordered an 18 inch pepperoni with basil for take-out and when we arrived to pick it up, the gentleman gave us an extra slice because he thought the pizza had looked a little small. We were both shocked because nobody had ever done something like that before! He was very friendly, not just to us, but to all the other customers there (I'm assuming he was the owner). Loved the pizza! Great flavor, not too greasy, and big slices. Didn't think it was on the smaller side at all ,but greatly appreciated the extra slice of deliciousness!! Will definitely go back!

We've been waiting for the shops in The Colony to open up; so glad this place is now open! We were actually on our way to eat somewhere else when my fiancé mentioned The Herb Box was now open so we made a split decision and decided to try it out. It was lunch time and the weather was perfect so we sat outside. Indoors, it's still pretty open and very nice. The service was wonderful! Everyone was really friendly. I've been obsessed with roasted cauliflower lately so I had to order their Korean fried cauliflower appetizer. The dish itself was small pieces of cauliflower sitting on quinoa but the korean hot pepper sauce was so flavorful! I loved it!  For the entree I ordered the blackened salmon blt. Again, another great dish! I did think that the spices on the salmon made it a little "salty" for my liking but it was still a great tasting blt. I didn't realize my dish came with sweet potato chips (as did my fiancée's) and I wish I would've asked if we could substitute that side since neither one of us likes sweet potato anything. As a heads up, if you don't like sweet potatoes, ask if you can substitute them. Next time, I'll be sure to ask! I didn't order off their dessert menu; however they have a mini bakery so I decide to try the blackberry empanada and I loved it! I was a bit skeptical at first since I normally don't care much for blackberries but it looked too good not to try; it turned out great! Overall, this is a great new spot! Perfect for lunch, great service, and good food!
