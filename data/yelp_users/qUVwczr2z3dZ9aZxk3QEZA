Ugh! Wanted to love this place, but from the get go, server "Bethany" was lacking. Spilled margarita on the husbands phone, never brought more napkins after half an attempt at apologizing. Guacamole came out with the meal- blamed on kitchen for the mistake. Apparently my sister ordered a burrito unbeknownst to her. After some confusion when food was delivered, Bethany came back out and using a snarky tone told my sister what she ordered and again half attempted to get what my sis really wanted. Instead of waiting another half hour for what she really wanted, her and my husband switched plates. Whatever we weren't going to argue. Long story short, my husband, sis and I have all previously been in service and the service here was definitely slow and lacking. Not worth the money for the experience we had. 2 stars was only given for food. Service was bad to say the least. Would hate to see what a busy night would be. We came on a Tuesday. Will not return

If I could give zero stars I wouldn't first went to the patio for seating and was told by hostess " I don't know how long you'll be waiting we just sat all the tables" no offer to put our name on the list or anything. Went to the front to sit. Most all tables were open. We were seated at a dirty table that a rag was left at. Gross! I should've left after that.. No we were hungry and figured we'd wait any restaurant had we left. Waited another 20 minutes for drink order... Over an hour later food arrives,cold small not very appetizing portions. Had to ask several times for items- drinks, silverware, check... You name it, we had to do their job. Plus my husband got sick a few days after eating. It appeared to be food poisoning to me. Just gross all together. I'd avoid this place at all costs!

Bought a groupon for this place. LOVED the atmosphere and food was fresh and delicious. All locally grown thrown together in a delicious sandwich. The only reason why I gave 4 stars is the price. Sandwiches range from 10-15.00 and everything is ala carte so it could cost over 20.00 for lunch. It is however very tasty and worth a treat every now and then. Beautiful pecan tree groves shops and local artists are on display here. Great place to bring the family and picnic.

Bought a groupon for 3 microdermabrasion treatments. The esthetician was very talkative ( I like quiet during my facial treatments) she went on to tell me all the gossip in the office and how she feels cheated by the Dr. There. How he hired her to " bring up sales" which she has, but still only gets 13$ hour... I could count 3 or more occasions the "F" bomb was dropped by her. I feel cheated and still have 1 treatment left. I've had better treatment at a beauty school. Stay far away from this place unless you like to gossip and hear a 20 minute spiel about their specials and how other treatments costing 100$ or more would benefit me. Worst part- the microdermabrasion did nothing for my skin. Feel scammed

I honestly don't even know where to start with this review. I purchased a living social deal for partial highlights, cut , style conditioning treatment. We recently moved here and are quite clueless about where to find hair stylists, spas, dentists, chiropractors, etc. I took a huge chance and this one surely paid off! Kim's room was decorated so cute and all "suites" were located in one building with other cosmetologists, estheticians, nail artists and other services. Easy to find and super convenient location.  I am turning 40 next month and wanted a little sass. I have had red highlights in the past and wanted to take that avenue this go around. Kim was not at all apprehensive and welcomed the idea. She suggested a choice of 2 red hues that would compliment my skin tone and from there she went to work.  The conversation was easy and comfortable and I am sure I talked a bit much because I did feel so comfortable.  The conditioning treatment left my hair silky smooth and super easy to comb( not always the issue with my head). The cut was great and Kim took off just the right amount to freshen it up and make it look super healthy.  I was in and out in less than 2.5 hours and feel AMAZING! The color is perfect and Kim offers a "thank you" for coming in with living social by offering same deal on next visit.   I am DEFINITELY returning to buy the conditioning product and for future hair service. I'm pretty sure I found my new hair girl and I couldn't be happier :)

Just had a fabulous massage with Ericka- very professional and great technique. She focused on my problem areas I indicated. I love having the massage in comfort of my own home. Her rates are affordable and skill is fantastic. Will be booking again:)
