Cool place with great views of the mountains. A nice little stop along Apache Trail.  We did not get the tours but we will when we bring our family to check it out!

Food was good. That being said, the service was so bad it was uncomfortable. The waiter didn't so much as nod at us, rather just came to stand at our table and stare at us. We, assuming he wanted to take our order, gave it, and he grunted and walked away. That's as much communication as we got the whole time, no lie.  We won't be back.

Overall we enjoyed our time.  The town is downright cool looking with all of the people in costume walking around.  They really stay in character and it makes it very fun.  We got a margharita right away and walked the town area, watching shootouts, etc.  We got my Mom arrested and then had dinner at the steakhouse.  Afterwards we had smores by the fire and talked.  My only complaint is that you literally can't hear the shows that they put on all over town (free ones) because they don't mic themselves.  Other than that we loved it and will be bringing our parents back when they visit in Feb!

Doors were supposed to open at 2. They opened two doors at 2:40 and a mad rush ensued. We waited in absolute chaos outside only to finally get in at 3:15. We then had to run to our seats through more crowded chaos only to have to wait again to enter where our seats were. Thinking it was their fault everyone was not there on time we thought for sure the show would be delayed right?  Nope, they started at 3:23. Not nearly everyone was in yet and they turned off the lights. Poor all around. From what I understand this is normal there. We won't be going back.

Good restaurant, good pizza, nice environment.  I liked it very much but for that kind of wait I can go other places that are very good as well.  I guess my point it it was great, but not for an hour plus wait.

"Quite possibly the best food I have ever eaten."  That was the phrase that came out of my husbands mouth-and boy do I agree.  We are not vegans or vegetarians, just folks in search of whole foods that are made with healthy organic ingredients.  Based on the reviews, we tried it last Sunday and WOW.  I can't imagine anything tastier.  That is, until we went back on Friday.  We had the quesadillas and the pizza and hummus.  We were truly blown away.  Yes, it takes a while, but the food is MADE FROM HAND there on the spot.  Healthy, organic delicious ingredients!  I will wait for that ANY DAY!  We can't wait to go back.  Sasha changes her menu weekly based on what she finds at the local farmers markets. We will be back, and back, and back and back.  Did I mention we will be back?  :)  Do not miss out, try this place TOMORROW!!

Not terrible but def not good. Sauces are ok, meat is either dry (chicken) or flavorless and tastes like it is boiled (brisket). The sides were ok but who comes to a BBQ joint for sides?  We tried this location in addition to another hoping that the different locations might do things different or better and nope, they don't. We wont be back.

We have been twice but will not be back. The food is mostly all hard fried with minimal actual meat. We tried the buffet the second time and everything was cold.  No dumplings in the buffet either.  The service is ok at best. Panda express was much better which is sad. I would rather support a local owned business but not in this case.

I called Justin based on these reviews and was not disappointed.  From our first conversation he was incredibly professional, giving me an accurate estimate and telling me what to expect.  The movers who came out: Chavez, Keith and Gilberto arrived 15 minutes early and worked very hard from beginning to end!  We had a great deal of big heavy stuff but they handled it all like the professionals they are.  We will def use them on our next move and would recommend them to anyone!

Nice atmosphere, fantastic service and more importantly flavorful and delicious food! We had the chilling chicken and garlic naan. This is quite possibly the most delicious Indian I have ever had. Highly recommend!

We are from Philadelphia and, having moved to Maricopa,  were looking for good food choices. We stumbled upon Say Sushi and were very pleasantly surprised!  Great prices and service but more importantly very good food and portions!  We can't wait to go back!

Their pizza is the most authentic Italian you will find here in Maricopa and we tried it all. From Philly and being Italian I was struggling until we found this place. Love it!

Like the reviewer below I also tried them out because I got a coupon through Living Social and I am so glad I did!  They are far from me but I will be going back again.  Everyone is so down to earth and friendly-and most importantly they are great at what they do.  I am heading back today, in fact!

Best fast food burger we have ever had.  Tastes better than a delicious restaurant burger.  We have been back three times in two weeks and we live in Maricopa, a half an hour away!  Get the chili fries, YUM!

10 flavors and 50 toppings, ok!  I got the cheesecake that is no fat no sugar added and it was devine!! Topped with a little granola and strawberries and it was a no guilt pleasure. We ate outside on a nice warm night.  We will be back!

We tried them on a whim, still on the hunt for "back east pizza". The garlic knots were good but the pizza was even better!  I eyed up the huge slice, I might have to try that next time. Great laid back friendly service and good food. Felt like a mom and pop Philly pizza parlor.

Their food is really delicious.  I would give it 5 stars were it by for the constant line. I don't like waiting in line 30 minutes-would rather sit at a table and wait. I know it's their "thing" and all but I just really hate lines. We have been three times since it opened and waited all three times. Won't stop us from going back but there will def be times I choose something else because of it!

Hart Computer Solutions responded to a laptop issue I had so quick!  Justin came out that night and worked tirelessly for me at such a reasonable price. Can't recommend enough.

We love smashburger. That being said, if this were our first visit to a smashburger we would never go back. I had to ask for hot sauce two times and never got it. We ordered two burgers and they came out, one wrong. We told them and they took it back. What we did get (mine) had the wrong fries and they were so greasy that they were gross. Twenty minutes later we asked again and they said "oops sorry we will make it now". Got it about 15 minutes later. By then I was long done my meal. They said "sorry here is a free coupon to make up for it" and it was a buy an entree get a free side coupon. Wow. No one seemed to care about anything there. We won't be back even though it is the closest one to us.
