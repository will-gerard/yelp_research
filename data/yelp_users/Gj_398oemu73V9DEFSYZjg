The bar was okay but the comedy show was horrible.

the food was really good but the flow of traffic in that place is stupid. I am not a big fan of the LA wannabes either, it's a place to eat so knock it off.

The atmosphere there is great, the food is pretty simple but tastey. I go there for their wine. It really is a great selection and the staff is pretty knowledgeable. I had the tuna sandwich for the first time the other day, cause I normally get the brushetta(sp?) and it was really good. It wasn't mayonnaise-ey. I would also recommend the nine iron.

I really like this place, it's got great wine, and the food was just right. I wish it was closer to my house.

There are seven people standing around and it still took 10 minutes to get a tea that two people ahead of me already received. Some randoms are talking about a ridiculous party and everyone is just standing around. I can't taste the difference between this tea and Starbucks tea. At least Starbucks doesn't take freaking forever, not worth it.

So we thought that this place would be fun and frolicky on a Light Rail opening kind of night. It was cold and boring. The martini's are stupid small and completely useless, the food was okay but not really worth a second visit. On a good note, the seating is fun, the couches recline.

I was there for lunch yesterday 7/2/2013 and had th emost amazing experience. We normally go for lunch pretty frequently and I have had nothing but awesome food. i am obssessed with the chicken salad sandwhich and then the Chino salad in that order. I haven't had a bad dessert and I have yet to drink there but that's to come for sure.   We go in and oorder and it's packed for lunch. My colleauge and I sit outside, which wasn't too bad for the first 20 minutes and I notice that my food hadn't arrived yet. Just as I was thinking about it , Cory the manager comes out to tell me that they are comping my food. He said that the wait was completely unacceptable and basically that's not how they roll. The truth of the matter is, I would have waited another 20 minutes for that sandwhich. It really made my day to have that happen. It feels like such a rare occassion that people go out of their way and it's nice when to see.

The food, the ambiance, the staff were amazing. I had the pork chop and it was so much food. They brought us the key lime pie and the brownie and they both were so delicious. I will be coming back here often. PS, the appetizer and the dessert were free.

The food was good, the portion sizes were pretty large but the overall vibe is really what makes me want to go back.

Super disappointed, our waiter was so rude and took forever so we left. I normally enjoy it there and the overall vibe is good but he was arguing with us about wine and it was pretty awkward.  ***Update, the management and owner reached out to me almost immediately and it's never really about what happens it's about service recovery and they really did a great job. I do enjoy this place and I know I will keep going back.***
