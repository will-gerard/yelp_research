Rent a car here HERTz few time but this time I rent for a week Sat to Sat $271/week and decide to keep the car Extra Mon n Tues and return on Wed morning and they charge me 4 extra days which is another $183. How do you count that is 4 days when I only use it Mon n Tues .????? Sun CLODED. If I know they count like that I rather keep it till Mon n it only double the rent which it $542. Total. Now I have to pay $454 for only till Wed MORNING.  I rent a car alots for business trip and other occasion but other company never like that. This rental place is rip off so make sure if u decide to keep another 2 day mine as well keep for another week. Becareful when you decide to keep extra day ppl.

Oh my my. Very busy place so the wait is more than an hour but when we first check in with the front desk they say 20-25 mins so we agree to wait. Later on we check back and they say still 20 mins again so we still wait and wait more than an hour they still not having table for us and finally they have table for us but unluckily someone just throw up right in the restaurant and it smell so bad then we have to walk out but they don't even say anything to us.  Bad management bad on timing too When it too crazy busy there are bad service here.

Went here couples time and order The same Crawfish every time And  I don't like potato But they keep putting it in there everytime and I did say Please NO potato ok I just don't get it why they keep put it in there when I say No Potato so I guess they put it in to weight more heavy and little less crawfish or something.  Please owner fix this matter and make your costumer happier and they will recommend other people for you because this problem is easy to fix. Hopefully will be better bc I'm a crawfish lover :) Ths
