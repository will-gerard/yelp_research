3 steps to bliss: 1. Whatever you are doing right now, stop. 2. Go to Sun Up. 3. Get a smoked salmon Rueben.  My brother drug me here during a recent visit and told me the pork verde was really good. He was right, but when I see something as strange as a salmon Reuben on the menu, I just have to give it a try. It was amazing. I haven't been that surprised by delicious food in years.  I didn't do a full beer tasting, but I did have the barley wine and it was very good. It was very fresh, as it should be in a brewhouse, but you could also tell they keep their lines and tap really clean. All I tasted was beer; it was served in a slightly chilled glass. Thanks, January!

I don't have an in-depth review, but I wanted to pile on say this place is great. I don't get mani's a lot, but I try to get one every few weeks. Ever since I stopped biting my nails, I must get them trimmed somehow. Lately many of the places I've been going just don't do a good job. I don't know if they think guys don't know any better or what, but it gets old. Also, I don't get pedi's though because my wife has scarred me for life by making me watch a 20/20 expose about them. Anyway...  This place was great! Everyone was very friendly and my girl kept the conversation going even though I wasn't feeling that great, so that was awesome. She was quick but thorough, which is also awesome.  She asked if I wanted my nails buffed and I said I didn't want them to be shiny. She said they wouldn't be too shiny, just look nice, then mentioned next that was it was $4 more but I sprung for it, because I was in a spending frenzy. :S They were very shiny. For a couple weeks. Not cool.  I plan on going back tonight, but I won't be getting my nails buffed. :)

Ok, I hate eating crow (read: looking like an idiot), but I'll do it for my fellow yelpers.  30 minutes after writing this review, I went to DV again. I got Julie and it was only a good experience. I clearly stated that I wanted my nails super short. She asked me to be sure and I said, yes, if I'm bleeding they are too short, but otherwise go for it.  They didn't get cut short enough, but mainly they were just uneven. Not uneven like the whites were uneven to actually round them correctly, but just uneven. :( Also my cuticles weren't cleaned up well. She did a decent job on my ridges, but overall it was too quick and not thorough.   Next time I go I'll have to make an appointment so I be sure to get someone else.

Ok, let's start with the good stuff (which was not readily apparent when I arrived). Elements gets snaps for:  Suggesting on the bottom of the menu that people turn off their cell phones A decent wine selection, including good by the glass options (perfect for the lonely traveler) Having foie gras on the menu since it's all but disappeared most places The views do indeed seem to be good You can sit at a 'community table' to meet fellow lonely diners  Back to the story: the restaurant isn't so much off the lobby as it is *in* the lobby. This is bad because you don't feel isolated from the hotel at some tables in the restaurant, which hampers the ambiance. When I first arrived, the staff was mingling and chatting amongst themselves and took a moment to acknowledge me. This would be accepable at Mel's Place, but not at a supposedly high end restaurant. The decor was obviously trying hard to be asian inspired, but misses the mark of being really beautiful or even cohesive.  The menu didn't inspire me. I'm not really a picky person, but the combinations just didn't sound good for the most part, or inlcuded something I don't like. I usually see 5 or 6 things at a restaurant that I want to try, but I had to look it over twice to find anything that sounded appealing. I finally settled on the swordfish with chorizo, shrimp, black beans and a morrocan cream sauce. I had ordered the foie gras as soon as the waitress came by and later found a Franciscan Merlot that turned out to be quite good.  The foie gras came out and it was absolutely wonderful. I was a bit worried as I really like crisp toast and liver that's been prepared so that you can actually smear it across the toast. This came on a somewhat soggy something called French toast and had been pan seared so that only the inside was creamy. However, it was still a delight to eat and I would go back just to get this $23 appetizer. Based on the implausibly good experience here, I was now more excited about dinner.  Then my entree arrived. I saw a piece of chorizo, which I love, so I speared it immediately. It was way over-cooked and not really spicy. In fear, I quickly tried the shrimp. It was also way over-cooked. The dish also came with tomatoes, which I hate and would swear weren't listed on the menu. The black beans were almost totally tasteless, which is near impossible, since the black beans I get in a can for like 50 cents taste better than this. The swordfish, oddly, was cooked perfectly and tasted buttery and delicious. However, as a complete dish it was an utter failure.  Based on the lackluster service, imperfect ambiance and ok to mediocre food, this place gets 2 stars on the value for your money scale. I'll go out and spend $150 on dinner for myself. But I expect the whole experience to be over the top. Here I spent $90 including tip and have had better food and service at Red Robin. In fact, I consistently get better food and service at Red Robin.

Based on Yelp reviews, I went to check this place out while I'm working on assignment in Phoenix. As promised the food was great, the service was great and I got to meet the venerable Thomas.  I sat at the bar and the boys took care of me. The Fez Kisra sounded good, but I should have listened to Russell's recommendations. I will definitely try those next time, which will be soon.  The wine selection was varied, but didn't blow my mind. I stuck with whites and found that the one that sounded the best wasn't nearly as good as the most popular (shockingly).  The place combines hip and tasteful decorating, good music, great food and a nightlife atmosphere. Definitely seems like a great place for a night out with the guys/girls if you don't want to be overly bothered.

I am in deep smit. This place rawks. It's not the ultimate dining experience I have ever had but the sushi is phenomenal! First off, the sushi chefs are actually Japanese and not Korean, Chinese or... we'll just say North American and leave it at that. Secondly I asked my test question (What is good for sashimi tonight?) and he immediately answered 'My favorite is the Japanese Red Snapper' (which I've never had). I was slightly dubious as this was the daily special but it was good. Freakin good. Slap yo momma good as my LA friend likes to say.  I was also slightly put off because the rolls weren't described anywhere. I asked my waitress (who was cutesy and attentive) about this and she provided me with this alien looking quintopod with little cards describing a few (five to be exact) of the roll contents. The Red Roll was the only thing that sounded good, but boy was it delish!  I followed with tuna sashimi that was definitely some of the best tuna I've had. I also tried the 'new' beer on the list Echigo which starts kind of like a premium American amber (like Fat Tire) but finishes like traditional Japanese lager. It was lovely and has me hoping it will be available more places soon.  The place is definitely not perfect and I can see what the other reviewer said about small tables and multiple menus (I was treated to 5). It's also probably not a great place to take a date unless they love sushi as much as I do. In fact ditch your date and take me instead!  But to me food reigns supreme. I'll sit on a bucket in a leaky tent to eat fabulous food and this was fabulous. I ate there over 12 hours ago and I'm still having food orgasm aftershocks.  The prices were reasonably high for a sushi place, but you definitely get what you pay for. I had the red snapper sashimi, red roll, tuna sashimi, more red snapper sashimi :D, and unagi for dessert, plus two beers and it came out to $75 before tip. Worth. Every. Penny.

The contrarian review... from an espresso purists perspective.  In my desperate search to find espresso near my hotel (which I think is old downtown, but I get confused easily) I put this place on my list.  To their credit, when I ordered a ristretto con panna, the barista thought she knew what I meant. I clarified, which is fine, and she went about making it. However, it wasn't drinkable. I got it to stay so I could enjoy it if it was decent, so I had to drink some while the barista watched, but I couldn't get it all down, even with 3 sugars (did that make sense to anyone?). I don't think it's even good enough to make a decent latte, either, so I won't be back.  On the other paw, they were playing some Flyleaf, so the music is good.
