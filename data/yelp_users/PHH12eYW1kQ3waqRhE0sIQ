They are accepting new patients now and I had my first appnt.  They were kind, on time, got me in within 1 day, very thorough, really took the time to listen and address all health concerns.  I'm so pleased to have such a wonderful family practice to care for my family in Chandler now.

Been to Casey Moore's 100x over the past 12 years.  I enjoy the ambiance, patio, the location, the suds, and the food.  A great "hole in the wall" feeling place, but not.  Parking can be a little tight sometimes, but I would never let that deter me.  Love their oysters and marinara shrimp boat.  A solid Tempe pick.  Looking fwd to my next 100 visits!

Jeff rocks!  He re-keyed our whole house (same day service) and adjusted our doors that weren't latching.  The fees were super reasonable. Jeff is a very professional and nice man.  A+!!!  We highly recommend him.

Have been going here for over 6 years and love it.  This is a true cowboy style restaurant with an all you can eat basic salad bar, cowboy beans & toast, potatoes, and all the common meat options.  The food is usually good.  The atmosphere is the best part, low key and awesome views.  If you live in Laveen or South Phoenix you should frequent the place.  They have locally crafted delicious brews.  We love to ride horses or motorcycles here, watch the sunset and chat it up with the locals and the workers.  Favorite restaurant in Laveen!  Hitching posts out back if you want to ride your horse here.  Very close (walking distance) to South Mountain trail head too.

I called Tony Penn and he came over to assess the dents and dings in my truck same day, since I lived so close to him.  He quoted a very fair price and scheduled the work for a few days later.  He showed up a few minutes early and completed the work in about 4 hours and wow it looks really great!!  He removed several dents, dings, and one very large section of damage (the result of a huge dent that we tried to repair ourselves) and he even made that look like new again.  He even buff out several scuffs and scratches that I thought were permanent.  I am looking forward to having him remove the dents/dings from our other car.  He's prompt, nice, professional, priced fair, and does great work.

Just purchased a used BMW R1200C and was appalled at the dealership prices for regular maintenance services and began looking for a small private bike shop.  Was referred to Josiah, the owner of Dirtball, by a fellow BMW enthusiast.  Josiah is BMW certified + works on all other types of bikes.  He's fair, friendly, and VERY reasonably priced.  I needed a couple new tires and he ordered them in for me on my word and the price was the same as any super cheap, no overhead, online motorcyclesuperstore type etailer.  He charged a fraction of the cost for install and then even test drove the bike for his opinion on it mechanically, he found a loose tail light.  He also adjusted my shock to my height/weight.  He didn't charge me for the test drive, shock adjustment or the tail light tightening.  I spend some time in the shop watching him work on my bike and could tell he's very careful with all of his customer's babies.  He had several folks drop in and drop off big expensive bikes of all flavors, all so relieved to have found him.  Josiah is honest, knowledgeable and and affordable, I highly recommend him.

I have called this doctor several times over the last 5 years for an appointment because they were the only family doctor near my house.  They always offered visits at least 3-4 weeks out!  I need care now, when I'm sick, not next month.  I have finally found a new doctor in the neighborhood, Dr Runbeck, he's also called Laveen Country Doctor.  He is actually a naturopathic doctor and offers alternative natural treatments and regular prescriptions (if needed), which I like MUCH better.  He is such a nice doctor, I am so glad he has opened an office in our area!

These guys only charge $50 for a 1 year warranty, provided you have no current termite activity.  I have had termites several times in the past and they still only charge $50 to bring the home under warranty.  So glad to have found them.

I have known Dr. Craig Runbeck for 5 years+ and he is an awesome doctor that treats your body as a whole.  He provides nauturopathic, allopathic ("MD style") and osteo/muscle manipulative treatments and usually treats by natural methods first, if possible.  His bedside manner is wonderful, he is kind, patient, and listens closely to be sure to treat/diagnose his patients accurately.  Our family highly recommends him!!  He is hands down the best doctor in Laveen!!  Finally a good Laveen family doctor (even though the address says Phoenix, he is in fact in Laveen).
