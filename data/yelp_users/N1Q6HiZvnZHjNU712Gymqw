Admittedly, I did not eat here.  I did come for two nights during the Phx Fringe and loved every minute of it.  This is like a hybrid dive bar and artsy hangout, being from Detroit, I felt right at home.  The eclecticness of the crowd matches the atmosphere, I mean, it's called the Paisley Violin, it's going to have some pretension.  The best part about this place is the rear patio, which is like a step into another world, old brick patio with art all around you.  We were made comfortable by a very appreciative staff and drank for pretty cheap, Schlitz was only $2.   The P.V. seems to be an attempt to give all the artists on Grand a place to go, we took the light rail here and rode our bikes.

Modified is a pseudo-art gallery slash concert venue in the great art's district in CenPho.  Well worth the cheap price of admission, this little gem hosts great shows in a slightly better than garage atmosphere.  Unique, yet somewhat traditional art usually adorns the walls, but must people are here for the music.  Just came from a show here and I must say:  I am glad that this place exists where it does and that it does what it does.  Too many mid-level but great bands skip over Phoenix but Modified pulls in a good handful.  A lot of the bands that play here would sell somewhat larger venues in other cities, but that gives you the chance to get a little more intimate with some fav artists here in Phx.  Modified could use to knock out the center wall and put the bathroom in one of those "Private" rooms, but the funkiness of the space doesn't deter from the shows.  Keepingoperational costs down keeps ticket prices down and good times keep rolling.  Lost Leaf is seriously a 1/2 minute walk away, so I recommend just taking breaks between hot and sweaty sets to grab a nice bev there and then return.

Best music store in Phoenix.  Yes, it is a pawn shop.  Yes, most of the stuff is used.  No, its not a dirty, back alley kind of place.  No, they don't hassle you and low-ball.  Tucked into the same strip as the deliciously caffeinated Lux and the wonderful, mozzarella of dreams Pane Bianco, Music Brokers is a place that would go unnoticed but shouldn't.  If you're going for your first guitar or trading up, this is the place to do it.  The give you good value for their trades and they don't over price the equipment they do have.  You can outfit your whole band here from cables to guitars to pedals to mics and save yourself some cash while get better products for the money than anywhere else.  If you are a fan of older keyboards go to the rear.  They have an ample selection of Fender Rhodes, Moogs and Wurlitzers.  Seriously cool stuff.  Great selection of British and American amps, Orange, Vox and Marshall.   Check out the competition, buy and sell here.

I had heard good things about NYPD, the reviews are high and I was in the neighborhood.  In the neighborhood is a whole mess of chain restaurants, for some reason I thought NYPD would be different than the rest of Chandler.  Nope.  Sorry, but I can't give this place anywhere near the other 5 star reviews presented below.  I don't want to talk you out of going there, they will feed you, no problem.  The thing is, it ain't all that great.  Maybe they had a good thing going at the beginning but this place is just as plastic as the others.  Everything is satisfactory here, but I really feel they're striving for the mediocre.    The food is good, generic American-Italian.  Pizzas are big and crusty, middle of the road thickness.  The subs are far too bready and the ingredients could be better.  Service was very nice.  I figure this place would be good for lunch, which is super cheap.  Where-o-where in Chandler can a man get some flavor that wasn't shipped in from a lab...

Had a great stay here over the past couple of days.  We came as an unwind after a far-too-busy wedding week for our stay-honeymoon.  We got a great deal on 3 nights and didn't really need to leave the hotel, a big plus.  The grounds of the hotel are beautiful, lovely ruddish pink with lots of trees and wood furniture abound.  There is a big pool with plenty of room for us but there is no sense of privacy there and it feels just kinda mediocre.  The rooms I am told are all suites, but since we were h-mooning it, the sweet ladies at the desk gave us a room with a beautiful view of the TPC course, the sunset and Camelback/Piestewa.  The room was very comfortable, great couch and huge bed, two flat screens and a balcony which was a perfect location for a room service feast.  We loved the food here, eating one dinner from room service and eating at the restaurant the other.  Both times we had the wedge salad, it was huge, very bleu cheesy and served with blistered tomatoes, which were sweet like fruit.  The restaurant night we shared the pot-roast, which was truly excellent.  The waiter described it as "like mom makes" and we didn't disagree.  The drinks, they have a great selection, but they were pretty over-priced at $12 for an Absolute Mandarin and soda for the lady.  This is more of a business hotel than a honeymoon spot, but we got such a deal that we were able to make a resort of it.  If you're coming in town to golf or watch golf at the TPC, I think this would be the perfect spot.

Go shopping for a half hour here and at any of the other grocery stores around, check out.  You'll have saved money and will have more actual food, less packaging and less chemicals.  As far as local grocery stores go, this one is my favorite.  The meat and produce are better priced and of better quality than any of the chains around.  Chicken breasts are consistently $3.00 a pound here, can't beat that.  The staff here are knowledgable, kind and interested in their jobs.  I try to do all of my shopping here as I think it makes me healthier and definetly saves me money.

Still loving Sunflower after a year and a half.  I actually moved houses to be closer to this grocery store.  The staff have never complained about going an extra mile, the prices have stayed better than any store I've been to lately and they have been having great beer specials.  Special note:  They have a large selection of homeopathic and environmentally sound products for your everyday corporal adjustments.  Tons of specialty soaps, herbal supplements and vitamins.  Check for the solution here before going to chain pharmacies!

Gold Bar is not hip, it is not polished, it is not new and it is not standard Phoenix/Tempe.  Gold Bar is easy to like and easy to sit in for a couple of hours grading papers.  I come from cozy towns in Michigan, where when the snow falls heavy the streets grow quiet and everyone you meet has tinge of red to their cheeks and the need for a warm drink.  There's a kind of empathy that comes with this quaintness that is hard to find in Phoenix.  It was there in the old 3 Roots but you had to trade it for slow service. It's not there at Cartel, but that's not what Cartel is about.  Gold Bar is charming.  You're transported, as much as can be hoped for in our strip mall culture, to a cozy living room in another town when you spend a couple of hours here.  The family that runs it knows many of the customers names, they sell hearty foods and heavy drinks.  Just from overhearing the son of the owners talk I can tell you: They have stamp cards. Monday is Pastry stamp Monday. Friday is Extra Shot Friday. Friday and Sunday nights are live Jazz. Sunday morning has classical guitar.  Saturday night is game night, where they have drawings every 20 minutes to give you free drinks, eats and prizes.  So, it is quiet and you can hear everybody else, the drinks are a bit expensive and the food is only okay.  All of those things add up to make this place a little slice of home for someone who is not the biggest fan of living in the city that ate the desert.

I don't know what happened with Matt but they were great to my friend. he ended up getting a Specialized hybrid for the purpose of commuting.  Their selection is a little small but they carry a few good brands (Trek and Specialized) as well as a good selection of tools and maps/books.  The sales people were very nice and put his bike together on the spot real quick.  They are a good small business and are a little more accessible to the aspiring bicyclist than the big boys and junk shops.

One time, at Office Max, I got a highlighter for a penny.  Another time at Office Max, they had average prices on average office supplies.  This one time, at Office Max, the staff were nice enough, though corporate slaves in their way.   I've been here several times, it was always an Office Max.

Phoenix is a small town when it comes to music.  I moved here from Lansing, MI, a town of less that 300k, and there are more music stores there I think.  Sad for Phoenix, but lucky that there are some good places to go like Milano to make up for some of the loss.   I came here with a friend looking for a new acoustic guitar.  The staff was very helpful and patient, the selection was okay, not overly impressive.  They carry instruments of all kinds for all kinds of players, so the store is overrun with school kids and amateur rockers alike.  Things can be a little crazy inside.  The location is great, right in sleepy downtown Mesa.  The store is huge and laid out in a sprawling, messy fashion that takes a bit of time to find where what you're looking for is.  For guitars, they have a pretty good selection of average instruments, nothing to write home about.  They seem like a dealer in Dean and Takemine for the most part.  I think their bread gets buttered by band instruments for high school kids, so the guit dept. is lacking, but not without a few winners.  I think it is possible to find a good deal on a good guitar in the under $1000 range here.  They also gave a fair trade in for my buddies guitfiddle, but insisted that he had to spend a ton of cash to make it worthwhile to them.  If they were anywhere else they would have to try harder, but for Phoenix they pass muster.

Trim Time is in a tiny little strip mall, right next to the beautiful Wright house on University in Mesa.  The girl's up front are very nice.  They have about twenty cages in a separate room to the side for dog drop offs.  The sink area in the rear seems nice, all of the dogs were quiet and seemed happy.  I only had my dog's nails and expression done.  Ten bucks a piece, nice that they do ala carte.   They gave my girl a christmas collar too!  Very nice and clean.

I am in love.  This restaurant does everything a good restaurant should.  Ambiance, service and product were good.  The only disappointment I had was with the hour wait on the Monday we went without a reservation.  My party of four had an excellent time celebrating a birthday.  Two had the short ribs.  Tender to a fault, served with delicious Bar-B-Que sauce and pecan grits.  One had the fillet with a spicy aioli and delicious potatoes. My meal was a huge pork chop, stuffed with Maytag bleu on a ancho bread pudding.    For an app I split the chop salad.  It deserves special mention and I do recommend it, but it is not a sustaining salad, more of a amuse-bouche.  For dessert we split the peanut-butter cheese cake, delicious.  The beverages deserve some mention.  The wine list is this restaurants' only fault, it is tooooo long.  There is a smaller, delicious by-the-glass selection.  The beer selection is well crafted.  I had two of my favorite beers, Dogfishhead Chicory Stout, something I had only had by bottle, wonderful.  I normally don't like high-priced eateries b/c there is often a lack of creativity, Cowboy Ciao doesn't disappoint.  Recommended over any Capital Griller or Flemmingsery for creativity and value for dollar.

It had been three long weeks in the sun. We were tired, we were burned, we had almost given up.  Mass-market invaders now knew us by name and we had theirs, Jarrod, Kay, oh-the-horror.  Does a young couple with big ideas and little in their wallets actually attempt to purchase jewelery from a boutique in Scottsdale?  I'm glad we took the risk.  Marina doesn't have a website, this is their first Yelp review, but in this ever changing world in which we buy in, finding them can make you break down and buy.  Live and let buy.  The thing that sold us here was meeting the jeweler and his wife, whose family has owned the business for over 2 decades.  These are sweet, generous and thoughtful merchants who seemed seriously committed to our finding the best wedding bands we could.  The shop is small, so the selection is limited, but what he does have in store is quality and original.    I found the band I wanted the first time we went, but patience prevailed and I waited a week to buy it.  When I returned he remembered me and pulled out the band right away.  When he replaced my lady's setting he took us in the back of the shop to watch him handle the diamond.  He's a good man, and thorough.  Highly recommended for wedding jewelery, grandma jewelery and presents for those highly deserving folks like Yelp Elite...

There are a few bar/restaurants in Tempe that are busy for a good reason.  This place is one of them.  Neighborhoody in its way, Four Peaks sits as the best place to take a visiting friend of any stature and taste.  Now, this place is pretty much always busy, so if you're not looking for a crowd, go elsewhere.  The crowd at Four Peaks is generally nice and attractive, everyone drinking good beer and eating good food.  The restaurant/pub is located in a beautiful brick building, hidden among the half residential, half industrial 8th street drag.  Very well designed place with giant brass kettles and wood adornments and tables abounding around the large, open seating areas.  The food is a notch above bar food.  Everything I've had I've enjoyed pretty much.  I recommend chicken strips (handmade!), italian beef beer bread, pizza and burgers all from personal experience.  The stout tiramisu dessert is great for beer lovers, though a little bitter for a dessert for some.  The beers are great.  Hands down the best micro-brewery in Tempe (I think there are only two though ;)  The stouts are rich and delicious, I'm a big fan.  I'm also a fan of the HopKnot, which is peachy and hoppy (as the name states).  For kicks, take the risk and try their seasonal beer, whatever it is, guaranteed a good experience.  Good place to go with a large group, a place to show a date you're in the know and also probably the tastiest place to rub elbows with the smarter side of ASU.

I had high hopes for the Marquee.  I hadn't had the chance to see a band there yet, tickets for My Morning Jacket were $30, not worth it for me.  But, when a friend wanted to celebrate is birthday there, I agreed to go.  First, the parking lot has no signs to signal you in, it is hard to see because it looks like you are forced to go onto the Mill bridge but then make a right at the last second.  Parking is $5?  What?  I should have parked across the street.  Now the tickets are not just the price you are quoted, they are marked up by a $3 service charge at the box office.  At the box office right in the theatre!  No ticketmaster, nothing.  Just raise the price of the ticket!  Now,  they make you take everything out of your pockets and force you to be patted down.  Errr.  Then, if you want to drink they take a photo of your license for their computer.  Errr.  Was there a shooting here or something, because this is ridiculous.  The interior looks like it is meant for 4 H Fairs or Amateur Wrestling.  There is a concrete floor, poor paint, and nowhere to sit.  The drinks are way over priced ($7 a shot for Jager!!!  Robbery!).  Give me $100K and I will turn this place into a venue worthy of its location and name, and make it a profitable venue.  Cheap carpet, sound baffles/curtains, high top tables, new paint in the lobby would make this a place worth seeing a show in.   I will try to avoid the Marquee at all costs, its too bad there is no where else for midlevel bands to play here.

The fact that I can walk across the street to this and Haji Baba has made my new house a very happy place.   Hoan has a diverse menu of Vietnamese and Chinese dishes. I always get the pho tai nam. I should try other things, and will, but the pho here is damn good and super cheap.  The well done beef in the pho is really tasty and tender, and there is tons of it.    Not dressed up in the least, this place reminds me of many places in Chinatowns of 'larger' cities. The owners seem to be always present, a family operation.   I asked the dad about the possibility of doing sandwiches and he said they might, if they can figure out a way to get good fresh bread everyday. As much as I would like a good bahn mi across the street, I really don't need the extra 10 lbs.   Khai Hoan. Consistent. Flavorful. Variety. Simple.

Harlow's, you are overrated.  Your potatoes are greasy and seem like the cook couldn't decide what they were, just make real hashbrowns.  Your eggs are too expensive and are not worth 2.50 a piece, ridiculous. The toast was coated is unmelted butter and the coffee was cheap.  I do not understand how you get] so many customers or why you are such a Tempe tradition, go to Chompies or Essence.

Good music venues need to be divided into their parts.  There are places to see good music, and good venues.  For Tempe, there is not really any place that combines both, sad to say it.  Yucca has great music, but the stage is in a weird corner and the acoustics leave much to be desired.  The Marquee has good music sometimes, but everything about the inside of the place makes me frown.  I would put the Sail into the second category.  I like the place a lot.  There are two stages here, in door is like a small bar with music.  Out door is a great little patio with something they don't make very often (and this isn't made all that well) a "band shell".  Created to funnel music out in a concert situation, the shell is an open air stage with a curved back wall (think sea shell stuck in the sand).  The stage placement provides much room for dancing and tables.  The music I've seen here hasn't been all that great, that doesn't mean it ain't a good time, it is.    Drinks are cheap and they have a pretty good selection with a few locals and micros, as well as cheap pitchers of schwil which goes well with outdoor partying and concert going.  I think I should try to see more shows here, in fact, I vow that I will.  Can't wait for cooler weather for the outdoor stage to be more available.

A little update.  The music selection actually looks like it is starting to hit its stride.  This month has 3 local great bands: What Laura Says, Black Carl and Sugar Theives all playing a bunch of times.  It looks like Weds nights are a great night for Sail.

Seems like there is a bunch of folks on here that got a wedgie just before they went in, maybe a trip to Sensations before your next visit?  It's just next door!  This place is an excellent excuse of an Irish Bar.  It is too big and airy for the Pub name.  To be fair, I do avoid this place on Fri and Sat nights, most of the other nights though it is a great, fun place to hang out.  They often have music, you can check the internet for details (sic).  One of my favorite aspects of this place is that inside and the back porch are two completely different feels.  I really like both, but prefer the porch at night unless there is good music.  Very chill and same stuff on tap and plate  The drinks here are expensive, but not necessarily over-priced.  The Guiness is thicker here, I think it is the imported kind.  They have an excellent selection of liquors, especially whiskey.  Their prices are better for expensive Irish Whiskey than other bars in the valley.   The food I've had is fusion Irish and very good.  The Beef and Guiness Boxty is heavy and delicious.  The salads are inventive.  Snacks are also good and high quality, the Irish Chips come with two great sauces and are a great snack over many drinks.  Go on a Thursday or Sunday night for dinner and drinks.  I think there is an open mic on Tuesdays

I wanted to try this place for a while, but they close at 9 everyday and I only crave pizza usually after a beer or two.  Made it for lunch because of Nick's $5.06 lunch and was pleasantly suprized by the Za.  The place is very, very simple.  I expected a more boutique pizza, but for the money this is good thin crust pizza with a tangy sauce and good cheese.    They could dress it up a bit, but then it wouldn't be so cheap!  I will go back and try the baked sandwiches and calzones soon.

I get my bike serviced here when I need anything, which is mostly tubes and accessories.  I ended up buying my bike from the other location, which has a better selection, but this location is convenient and rarely busy like the other.  The staff is helpful but a bit gruff, not really complaining though because I am happy they are confident in their knowledge.    All in all, good service, good sales and they give a 10% discount to ASU students.

Oh, Sacks, you lovely lady.  Everything I've had from you has been great.  You're a doll early in the morning, letting me feast on a chorizo, avocado and pepper jack all mixed up on egg sammie.  At lunch you tantalize me with your specials, how do you keep coming up with new takes on the same old sandwich?  Is it that your location is on the way to my office?  Is it that your selection of ice teas numbers the amount of fingers on my hand?  Your varying kinds of breads including tomato basil and something-chive?  No, no, no, it is the freakin cookie you put in my bag with every order!  It's like you're my nanny, girlfriend and second home all in one.  If I have a gripe with you it is this, well, I don't know how to say this, but... your coffee sucks.  ***Edit: Sacks now has great coffee!***  five stars now.

A little surprise in my Sacks sack today: an extra cookie!  They usually just include one cookie, but I guess I got the hook-up.  That and it was Facebook drink day, meaning I mentioned the occasion and got a free drink out of it.  Sacks continues to be well staffed with nice folk and innovative with their sandwiches.  I'll definitely keep them at 5 stars because at their price bracket they offer a serious and original sandwich.    I'm still buzzing from the ice tea I had at lunch (or maybe it's the extra cookie).

Top's really is what it says.  The beer selection really is unrivaled, period.  The staff is a little odd, but are very knowledgable and reliable.  The prices are hit or miss, but just ask them what the best deal is and they will tell you.  24 packs of microbrew for under $15?  All the time. They get new deals on Thursdays, but might not have them all out til Friday.  The middleaged man there during the day is the owner and a talker.  Ask him to recommend some wines and get a great deal and story.  Top's, you are responsible for making me a higher grain of alcoholic.  I love you.

Tricks is the only worthwhile option for fresh, creative fine dining level food in downtown Tempe.  The location is tucked away in a lovely old house, really two I think, with tables sprinkled in a lovely garden which is touched with artistic elements.  The house itself is very intimate, with brightly colored walls and warm atmosphere.   The food is seasonal and inventive.  Each course we had brought beautiful presentation and touches of character.  The wine list is well thought out and the waiter really knew how to suit a wine with our tastes.  Excellent experience, can't wait to have the occasion to return!

Great bar with mediocre food.  The best times to go are happy hour and from 10pm on.  Happy is $2 off food and $1 off beer.  I get the wings during happy hour and am always full from what seems like more than a dozen.  This is kind of a see and be seen place, but not a meat market like the bars on Mill.  If I am downtown and get sick of annoying frat kids, Casey's is always good.

They did a nice job expanding this location.  I moved here right as they were doing it, so I didn't suffer long.  The beer selection does seem smaller now, but the wine is larger.  Though it is a big store, the sections do seem kind of small, but I guess that makes it seem not like a big grocer...  Like most other TJ's in my experience.  Clean, upbeat and tasty.

Well, on a slow Sunday after Halloween morning, the lady and I were in dire need of something tasty to soak up the tricks that all the previous night's treats had left us with. We thought that PeiWei would do the trick, some kind of noodle something or other. Turning into the parking lot too early though had us passing this place, we yelped it and seeing its solid four stars after 40 reviews, we had to try.   Tott's does not disappoint.  The menu is actually pretty similar to Pei Wei with one outstanding factor, the owner of this place came out and talked to us, him and his family own and run it.  They've been there for six years now he says (2 before Pei Wei).  Pretty messed up that the property owner would put a second Asian diner in there.  Pretty messed up that Pei Wei would try to exploit a mom and pop shop's built up following.  Tott's still thrives he says, and thrive they should.  Service, ingredients and preparation are outstanding here.  The menu spans several nationalities, from Chinese to Thai to Japanese.  Pretty basic stuff but great if you have a craving for any of those, and easy to suit many palates in one place.  Lady had the Hong Kong noodles.  Wide noodles with cabbage and bok choy.  Wonderful flavor here, kind of a grill taste.  My choice was Udon noodles with beef as well.  Noodles were very soft and the fermented beans that made the sauce for mine were very flavorful.  Neither dish was particularly spicy, but both had great flavor.  Definitely better than any fast Chinese I have had in the valley.  Great atmosphere, friendly service and excellent food for very cheap.

Solid four stars.  Really fresh bread, low prices, delicious grilled pork and excellent staff.  The place is a little off turning to the eyes, very neon and gaudy, but the sandwiches are right on the money.  Not the best Grilled Pork Sam I've had, but up there and definitely worth the drive and the $2.50 is costs.  It is one of my American dreams for Lee's Sandwiches to replace every McDonalds in America.  Now to replace Olive Garden with Oreganos...

Really is a beautiful setting for dinner.  Met some family there and had a good time, few apps but no drinks.  The design of the restaurant really is gorgeous, light wood tables, copper and stone.  It is a bit loud, but was great as we had a baby in tow.  The food is a bit over priced, the $12 burger was delicious but wasn't a $12 portion.  I would guess rent and snootiness are expensive where they're at and the Ferrari drivers don't seem to mind.  I would like to go back and get the roasted chicken dinner.  We had Guac to start which was excellent and fresh.  You can get out of here with your wallet if you don't drink, but what fun is that?

Hello, its called the Pink Taco! Guaranteed to be just a name and not meant for any means of food quality. Hello....anyone getting this pink taco! Not tasty, no, no, no. It would be better if they served sausages and named it slippery dicks!

It's been a few months since starting at PF (ah, resolutions and their obvious cross-overs into gym discounts) and I can say they provide a solid, no-frills place to gym up.  The things you don't pay for here are what distinguish it from other gyms.  No towels, no pool, no personal dvd/mp3/workout-for-you machines, but for $10 a month, the yeses make up for the losses.  Their main marketing motto is my favorite part of my experience at PF: No Lugs; I don't have to watch people over do their work out and listen to them grunt about it.  If you live in the area or don't mind just doing a quick rinse with your own towel and all, then PF is right for you.  That I can cycle on my own to warm up, come in for a half hour of weights and get home in minutes makes this a perfect solution for myself, and those in my neighborhood.  The one thing I don't dig:  not enough dedicated ab/stretching area.  It's  a little uncomfortable to do any kind of crunches/floor stretching. There is a little area, mats and medicine balls enough to get it done, but if I had my way I'd take out the tanning machines and give the midsection a little space.

What's the big deal?  Atmosphere, knowledgeable staff, local products and good selection.  I shop at Amazon and at Changing Hands.  I really think this is a great place.  I buy most of my gifts from here, I like to give books and local artist's stuff.  The store is a really jewel in valley because of its local flavor and its commitment to keeping Tempe smart and informed.  There are very few bookstores as good as this one in America anymore, clean, stocked and popular.  And being attached to a Wildflower is good for anybody.

Coffee is delicious and the ambiance is nice.  The service is SLOW, but they are nice kids working there.  For being such a homey place, they do keep it very clean.   I haven't tried too much of the food.  They have a cool PBJ with pecans and honey.  The hummus is a good treat for veggies.  The muffins are $3 and not very large...  Deserves 4* for effort and being a safe haven from the chains.

If you squint at just the right angle while sitting on the patio of Phoenicia, you can almost see the ocean. This is perhaps the most relaxing place to sit and have lunch around Tempe.  The white patio is shaded by sail-like blue awnings which reminds you of that great trip to Greece you wish you had actually taken.  The only drawback for tall peeps is that the seating is a little lower than normal, tiled benches and cushioned stools, which leave me straining under my now heavier weight ever time I get up to leave, but... maybe I should just stay.  I have had many of the dishes on the menu here and have been satisfied on every occasion.  This is properly prepared and portioned middle-eastern food, cooked with great skill and care.  The flavors don't pop for me on every dish, but that doesn't keep me from coming back on an almost weekly basis.  Favorite dishes here are the veggie platter, the fatoosh salad and the labneh plate.  This was one of the first places I've ordered labneh and I am now a serious strained yogurt fan.  It might not sound very appetizing, but labneh is seriously good snack food and a great change from the typical hummus and baba routine.  Think thick, semi-sour cream cheese served with pita and olives.  Definitely Mediterranean, a nice snack while in your cabana.  I love the two candies they have by the register here: Turkish Delight and Cotton Candy.  The Cotton Candy is like a little spun sugar pile that resembles more of something you'd find under your bed than a dessert, but that makes all the more fun to eat as you walk out the door and return to the desert.

With a little trepidation... I will leak my new favorite breakfast spot.  Mac's is a nice little neighborhood bar, nice selection of brews on tap, good food of a great variety and excellent staff.  Its location is what helps make it a standout, it is in one of the best strips in all of Phoenix.  Book-ended by Tempe's best bookstore and Tempe's most in-touch record store, this is the perfect place to start or finish a weekend morning.  The thing about the breakfast here is that it has two of my favorite qualities:  good and cheap.  Not cheap ingredients, nope.  Apple cider bacon, pecan pancakes, heavy and delicious huevos.  All of their offerings center around 6 bucks.  In Tempe, which is notoriously over priced in the early morning offerings, that is very cheap breakfast.  The light enters the room just right in the morning, casting amber hues around the room as you sip coffee, listen to pretty bad music and enjoy your hearty breakfast.  Take a stroll to Trader Joes, buy a few albums at Hoodlums and work up an appetite for Tott's (which is right across the street).

As confused as the seating is in this place, the decor, ambiance and product are spot on. Cozy furniture when you get a spot. Extremely delicious bar food. Choice selection of beers and wines.   The Roosevelt is a charming place. Spending a hour here can renew your faith in Phx.

Essence is a great addition to Tempe.  The food is bistro style, the chef Eugenia does amazing things with savory and sweet alike.  The ambience is nice, very simple and under done, it is funny how you have to get your own coffee, water and silverware, but that is bistro style and also keeps help costs down.  I go here for breakfast every other weekend, though it is not open on Sunday :(  The food is amazing, the only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is the portions are too small and could be bigger without any effort.  I would say it is a bit over priced, but Arizona breakfasts all are, so for this you get quality for your $12.  The mascarones are some of the best cookies I've ever had, get the caramel.  I had the burger the other week and it was good, with a garlicy whole grain mustard and brioche bun, but it didn't hold up through the whole meal.  The potato salad was way too mustardy.  I am thankful for Essence and everyone that works there, they are the envy of all other restaurants in the valley.

Situated in a gorgeous Southwest inspired building on University, this gem has become a favorite of mine for several reasons.  First is the building itself.  You see, the way the light from the sunset pours over the stucco walls and onto the polished cement floor and the dark wood throughout, highlighting the beautiful concoctions in your glass and on the walls, well, that is something which can't be replicated.  To sit and sip a fresh-lime juice Margarita as the light fades from the day, ah.  Second, every thing I've eaten here has left me wanting more.  In a sea of mediocre Mexican, M.G. stands out as a clear favorite of Phoenix.  I believe the quality and quantity of dishes here blows away your Barrios and Gringos, sure you pay a bit for it, but the Guac is topped with a Grand Marnier and Jalapeno reduction!  Are you kidding me!?!  Third, and maybe most important, is the excellent Happy Hour that has become a staple of my diet.  Margs and beers for $3, Apps for $5.  The Apps list is large and diverse enough to get me coming back once a week for a year now.  The $10 nachos are $5 at HH and are huge. The rosemary mexican fry-bread pizza is so filling and tasty I can only eat half. The gringo quesadilla comes with a delicious salad topped with queso fresco and corn salsa. Glory!  I understand all of the lack-luster reviews here, the prices are a bit high for dinner, but the work that goes into what they do must be the cause.  There are a few of over priced, "fancy" dinner places in Tempe, Mucho Gusto is fairly priced, great at Happy Hour.  Special notes: 1.  The staff is a collection of sweet and hip folk.  Fletcher, the bartender, is a cool cat who'll bend over backwards for you to have a good time.  2.  The guacamole gets a mention again.  It is my favorite in the world. 3. They make a drink called the Mexico City mule, which they special order a ginger ale for, you can't order the ginger ale separately.  The drink is awesome, tequila, ginger and cucumber... try it.

I don't know if I'd call it a dive bar exactly.  I mean, it's sits next to Fremont, which is like combining all of the worst bars in the world into one, I'd put the Griffin in a class above.    After a hard week of work and drinking, being chewed up and spit out by the unfriendly world of casino bars and touristy places, The Griffin was a savior.  My friend had suggested we do Fremont and I was severely depressed after waiting for him there for a couple of hours, damn that place is sad.  After walking around through the decaying people and buildings, I said, "let's go check out this East Fremont."  Well, not steps from the faux glitz, there were a couple of tricked our bicycles attached to a street sign, saving grace!  "We're going in here."  Good bicycles mean two things: locals and fun locals.  The Griffin is a classy joint, not bad at all.  They have a full bar and a great staff.  It's a bit pricey, but that might be keeping some tourists out.  I'm also betting you can get a $3 Pabst there.  Hip and homey, the griffin is a dark, delicious alternative to pretty much every other bar in Vegas.  Great music, tatt'd bartenders, cute clientele, all adding up to a nice experience.

The hidden gem of cenpho. Free music all the time and decor that is as inspired as it is tasteful.   You'd expect it to be smaller from the outside.   Phx is lucky to have this place and the Rosevelt leading a trend in shining up the most central of houses in Phx. Think small, then think big.  Special mention for the beer selection here. All bottles, good specials and a huge selection. Seriously cool boho hang out.

I can't attest for the bad service, but I could see that happening, they're severely understaffed and those that work there seem young. That being said, I will give the 4 stars on their food and ambiance, really the food is 4 star food for the price point in my book.  I don't know if I've just not had Turkish, but the food here is awesome.  Everything is recognizable on the menu: schwarma, lamb shank, hummus, falafel, etc... but when it comes there is always a deliciously different taste to the food.  The baba ganoush is smokey, the falafel is served with a oniony cucumber sauce, and on and on...  Give this a shot.  Strong, yummy flavors in a relaxing, causal environment. Come early for good service?  Dunno.

Great. Great. Great.  This place is sparkling clean, friendly and convenient.  It is a little hard to notice from a drive down Uni but do yourself the favor.  When I went in, the owner, Merlin, was making fresh tzatziki sauce by hand from fresh cucs.  He explained that most of their dressings and sauces they make by hand, including the garlicky and delicious pesto.  Their menu is a cross between deli and Greek, which serves many lunch tastes.  They also have an excellent selection of sodas and sides to satisfy.  Next time I'm getting the veggie kookoo, a garden patty that he makes by hand which sounds delicious.

Lil' update:  The veggie koo koo is amazing, kind of like an Iranian quiche or frittata, less eggy though and more herby.  Delicious and healthy.    The hummus is also made by hand and is wonderful.  When I walked in there were 5 Tempe cops finishing up their lunch.  You know a place is good if cops eat there in groups.    Perfect for lunch.

Living within walking distance of the VMR has been a great help to getting me around Tempe and Phoenix, and because it connects to the airport, around the world.  The VMR is an excellent way for tourists to see the city, allowing them to travel through the two best downtown areas, as well as much of CenPho.  The VMR is totally limited as of now, but an expansion into downtown Mesa and a branch into Scottsdale or at least Central East Phoenix will do wonders.  The Light Rail's economic impact is yet to be seen.  To judge the success of the service on ridership alone is missing the point of progress.  There are several groups that opposed the rail, and many of valid points, but now that we have the rail here, shouldn't we just work to make it better?  3 stars because it is a good start and improves the value of the city to visitors and inverstors.  Only 3 because of some poor planning (oddly configured change over at the airport, no extension to Mesa's downtown and the fact that it will stop in the middle of its route at midnight).

It was a.... Bed, Bath and Beyond.  Yeah, they don't differ that much place to place.  The staff here was very helpful, though for my taste they were perhaps a little over-zealous, can't be blamed for that.  The store isn't too huge, though still rather huge, so they don't carry everything the others do.    The only reason I'm reviewing a BBnB and giving them 4 stars is that I was looking for a bread maker and they found one which had a price discrepancy that made it like $70 cheaper than it sells for else where.  They fought pretty hard to try to get me one at that price, to no avail but they tried while I kicked back in the homedics back molester...  Not a bad day.

Read the other reviews for longer discussion.  I really feel that this place is given it's fair shake, it's a great little Thai place, no frills.  The food is different than Thai Basil and Thai Elephant (both about a mile away) in that I think they offer a different selection of dishes, maybe from a different part of Thailand, maybe I'm talking out my ass.  The dish I had been missing most from those other places they had though: Pra Ram Long Song.  Thick peanut sauce (think molasses) over beef and cabbage.  Serious comfort food, heavy, sweet and spicy.  They definitely lose a star because they charge a dollar for rice.  What the f#ck Lemongrass?  Charging for rice at a Thai place?  That's like Guitar Center charging for some sweaty douche bag employee to showoff on the axe you're interested in; it is supposed to be free.

This is the one bar in town that when I go I know I'm going to have a good time.  It's a dive, a dive of dives, and I have had some of my best times in Tempe in this dive.  Hu seems to really love musicians and local music, so much so that he never charges a cover for music at this place, which makes for a cheap night out whenever the plans go all Yucca.  The bar is loud when there is music.  If the music is good you might not even have room to stand.  The people are weird, but I'm weird, so I love this place.  If Tempe is going to be great for music again, with the Sail reopened and 910 reopening, Yucca is the one place that might have preserved enough original and quality music to build upon.  Drinks are cheap, from tall boys of PBR to whiskey to... that's all I've ever drank there.

Oh great, just what I needed, another strong beer and craft liquor bar bar full of great people, nice pool tables and next door to my favorite music venue in the city of Tempe.  They've done a great job with this place.  You could still smell a bit of the varnish from the new bar and walls when I went in, very cleanly done in greens and wood to reflect the three pool tables.  They have a nice selection of taps and a huge selection of bottled beer.  The owner said that they've got local artists bringing in rotating art starting next week.  The liquor selection is a thing of beauty.  Rodney has sought out the best micro-distilled spirits he can find.  He poured us a little sip of the Dry Fly vodka and gin, both amazing, beyond your normal liquor for quality and smoothness.  What I like best about this place is that it isn't trying to hard.  The crowd was still a Yucca crowd, the music was still rock, nothing loungey about it. Though my wallet dies every time I say it, Long Live Yucca.

Sack's is not full of gold, but silver for sure.  I eat here once a week at school.  I like the symphony and the chicken salad for lunch.  The cookie in every bag is a nice treat.  The sandwiches are like something you could make yourself, they are not the greatest, but they are good and different.  Two things about this place:  The Market Spice Ice Tea is addicting and wonderful.  They are the most underrated breakfast place too, get a bagel toasted with eggs, bacon, spinach and mushrooms for $3.25?  Can be beat!

Cartel is a coffee world unto itself for downtown Tempe, which is void of many non-alcoholic places to hang out.  Situated in what seems to be a motel from the outside and a garage on the inside, Cartel can satiate your brass tax coffee fix and your espresso lust for reasonable prices.    The coffee is great.  Period.  They roast the beans themselves, know way too much about coffee and are proud.  The espresso, in whatever form you get it in, is rich and nutty.  The toddy (cold brewed iced coffee) is strong to the point of me jittering out the door from a small one.  The teas are various and steeped in a cool manner and timed according to their type.  The vibe can come off a little pretentious sometimes with all their rules and such, but they are selling a great product and the rules help distinguish them from the crowd.  I like to hangout here for an hour every week or so, good people watching, the pretentious guy behind the counter is good to listen to if you want to hear people getting so-so advice that they didn't ask for and my professors come here so it is a good place to catch them not in work mode.  My only complaint is that they need to find a way to get a bike rack closer to the door.  My only other complaint is that they could have more snacks available, I would love to dip something baked in their coffee.

This is an attractive, mid-priced option for the downtown Phoenix ASU campus.  I went with a fellow foodie and a couple of newbies to food re:the islands.    The staff was very friendly and well kept, the place was as well, very attractive from the street and the interior is small and simple.  The food was good, perhaps a little tame for true Jamaican, but very tasty and healthy.    We had the spring rolls to start, I would skip them next time and try one of the pies instead.  They let me taste the somekinda-flower juice, which tasted close to Hibiscus juice and was a little strong to drink a whole glass of.  I settled for an imported Ginger beet.  They also have a carrot juice concoction which involves vanilla and ginger which sounded good.  For the meal I had the Brown Stew Chicken, my friends had the curry chick and jerk chicken.  I think mine was the best and def give credit to tiphanie b. for the recommendation.  Each plate came with 2-4 sides which made the meal a lot of fun.  Great location, service and ambiance.  Pretty good food, not your down and dirty jerk shack but an excellent addition to the downtown scene and one of the only places open for lunch on Saturday and Sunday.

The series of 1 star reviews below is unfair, they place only has like 30 chairs in it total, in order to serve 30 people at one sitting, they would have to close the restaurant down.  I wish there was a civil service requirement where everyone would have to work in a restaurant.  The fact that these people assume they are the judges of east valley taste is ridiculous, I would hate to be around a table of 30 people all scheming to write bad reviews of the place their still in...  Enough ranting.  The service here is very nice, the staff knows the place backwards and forwards and the decor is well kept and very Northern New Mexican.  It's a little disconcerting from the outside, par for many great places in Mesa.  The food is spectacular.  This is food that it takes time to make.  Pecan wood smoked shrimp, pork abodova all take time and good ingredients to get right.  We did it right here.  Had the New Mexican Corn Chowder to start, creamy and delicious.  Margaritas are huge and very good.  For dinner I had the Taos platter, Tenderloin Rejeno, Shrimp Enchilada and smoked pork tamale.  All of which were great.  I am a huge eater and could not finish my plate.  We did have room for a glass of port, nice liquor selection btw and an order of their banana creme brule which was a nice end to a nice meal.  Great place, great way to ditch the sonoran mexican food blues.  Unless you like Sonoran cheese and grease on a plate.  These chips and salsa were great, verde salsa and multicolored corn chips.  Yes!  Oh yeah, also very affordable, no dish is over $20, including the great steak my gf had.

Tempe Animal Hospital.  Baseline Animal Clinic.    Though it is a clean place with a nice staff, I too feel, like the many other reviews below, like they are ripping me off.  I've taken my dog there 5 or 6 times, but this is the last.  They guilt you into feeling like you should be paying $500 for multiple tests (urine, blood, stool) all at once, instead of trying perhaps one test at a time or really trying to diagnose the problem.  They don't talk about the issues in the room with you, but go out and work-up an estimate and bring it back in, like your dog is a car or something.  No other vet I've been to behaves this greedily.  I don't feel guilty for going to another vet who charges me less, works with me to find a cure and doesn't inflate their prices.

How lucky us Phoenicians are to have a beautiful preserve so near civilization.  We went in late March and it was a great, leisurely hike.  As soon as you turn the first bend you really lose the city behind you and are in the desert.  Arizona's deserts are really something special, so alive.  One note:  The little barbed suckers on the trail, they're all white and fall off of the cacti which line the path, are not good for humans or dogs.  Don't use your hand to pull them out.  We used an extra shirt and it took some time get them dislodged from the curious pup.

I went here for a poetry reading/concert that a friend who was on tour had booked.  They do slam poetry once a month or something here, great readers.  The place itself is totally cute.  Checkerboard floor and chalkboard signage.  The pizza and sandwich selection is ample and mouthwatering.  I had an Italian cold cuts sandwich.  Served hot with red peppers and lots of cheese, this sandwich was amazing.  I think what set it off was the bread.  It was so good I knew my friend had to try it, so I traded him my second half for his meatball.  The meatball was also awesome, very saucy, good spices in the balls.  The thing about this place which I love, just like Otto's in Tempe, is that it is a family run business, run with love for the people and food he serves.  When I mentioned my liking of the bread he patted a bag of flour and made a point of the fact that it is never frozen, nothing ever is, he makes the dough each day.  There is going to be an expanded bakery in back, a cake shop I think.  This place is going to really hum when they have both businesses going.  Mesa is lucky.  At the end of the night, the owner was overly appreciative of my friends words and music.  He asked for an encore and bought one of my friends cd's.  What a guy.

Just came home from a great meal at Thai Elephant.  We had only been to Thai Basil, many times, and since we pass this everytime we go there, this time we decided to stop at T.E. instead.  I am glad I did.  I wanted Thai because I woke up feeling a little cold coming on and love spicy food when I am feeling under the weather.  The restaurant is pretty big compared to Basil and not as warm, but it is perhaps a little more formal and classy.  They also serve alcohol, which includes Mai Tai's and Thai beer.   We both, my girlfriend and I, had very nice Jasmine tea.  The menu is big, maybe 30 dishes, and there is a separate lunch menu which is about the same size.  The average price is about $10 for dinner and the variety is great.  There are some cute typos on the menu, I think that is mark of authenticity, as is the waitress' not-so-great English.  We ordered pad-thai and a Masaman curry.  The pad thai was delicious, the chicken with it was very fresh and it always comes with tofu, which was better than most tofu I've had.  The Masaman (sweet nut) curry was delicious and spicy.  I had only had Basil's Masaman, and this was much better, more taste than just coconut milk (though Basil's is good too).  I would go to Basil for a cheaper meal, but this seems like a little more work went into the sauces and meat was better quality.  They have a nice happy hour with cheap dishes and drinks from 5-7pm.

Out of the thousands of items they sell here, I saw maybe 4 items that weren't wrapped in plastic.  Everything there looks manhandled by a giant cooperate packaging monster who wants to suffocate all things natural out of your food.  There were some free samples.  They were chicken wings, from a package, left out not under a heat lamp or anything.  I watched an old man grab one, take one bite and throw the wing out.   The staff were not clean or helpful.  I wandered around, not one smile or hello, and left.    Good marketing.  Bad Product.  Bad for the Environment and Local Economy.

I really like this place.  Their menu is eclectic and healthy for the most part.  Everything seems very fresh and has always been good.  I really like the Turkey Rueben, I can't find a way to order anything else.  I hope this place proliferates to somewhere closer to my house.  It is a little crazy on the weekends, but why complain that a good place is busy?  That means it will stay open!

This service was great.  Each driver was very nice and the cabs were totally clean and stank free.  We were able to get a cab in 10 minutes to our door at 1:40 in the morning, and the person was happy to be there.  Cool feature, they text you when they're on their way, so you don't have to guess!  Very helpful and easy.

This place is a lifesaver for Phoenix Mexican food.  I've tried and tried to find "good" Sonoran style Mexican food and am always disappointed by a greasy mess, up until I stumbled upon ATS.    The people that work here are very sweet and the decor is charming.  I would describe it as a kind of surf shop meets diner decor.  It is in a cute older house on 7th, well maintained and colorfully adorned with artsy knickknacks and brickabrack and such.  The food is very cheap and very simple, you can tell that love goes into every dish.  A bean burrito is $3.25 and very filling.  The been and cheese concoction that fills it is very tasty but not overly greasy, much unlike many of the other lauded burrito places in town.  The veggie quesadilla was delicious as well, kind of crunchy from the cabbage or something that is inside.  Both were served with some traditional accoutrement and homemade, wonderful salsa.    The jewel of my meal here was the white corn on the cob.  Not really knowing what I was ordering at first, I was a little doubtful, but really wanted something more veggie like to round out the meal.  What came was the most wonderful ear of corn I have ever eaten.  The cob is a sweet white corn which is then slathered in a slim coat of mayo and dipped in what I think was parmesean cheese (but was probably the Sonoran equivalent).  This was served with lime and a chili sauce that was sweet and spicy and out of this world when doused on the corn.  What a great little place in a wonderful neighborhood (maybe my favorite) of central Phoenix.  If you feel let down by the Mexican food that has covered this valley in a layer of tasteless grease, go here before giving up (also go to Mucho Gusto in Tempe, ATS is the cheaper option).

ATS is down to 3.5 stars now?  No way!  This place rocks.  My lady and I have a ritual of sorts now for this place.  I'm here pretty much every Sunday afternoon  The tortillas here are so fresh and delicious, probably my favorite.  This place is not your greasy Mex place, it is clean and well thought out.  The menu is small, but I never am craving anything they don't offer (i.e. everything they have is good).  I have tried a bunch of similarly priced mex places in the valley and ATS outdoes them all.    You can spend more money to get a higher level of Mex, but at $3.25 for a bean and cheese burrito from heaven, this place is perfect.

As I sit here, consumed with a meat based hangover, I have fond memories of last evening.  The service, the food, the crowd all fabulous.  I can't thank them enough, for a graduate student who has had dreams of reaching meat nirvana, this was an excellent opportunity.

Had a pretty awful time at this bar.  The service was distracted and heartless on many accounts.  The place looks like it should be in a mall, overly polished and plastic.    Over-priced drinks, which sound like good ideas, often come out overly sweet or poorly made.  I would say get here before 7pm to have an okay time by getting a good deal.  I was going to get food but the bartender never came back.  Gross clientele as well.  Greasy and silicone, and both not in a good way.

I am totally happy this is in my neighborhood. This is now my go to place for a quick bite as everything I've had has been very tasty and fresh.   Of note is the chicken bruschetta sandwich. Misnamed in its way, the pita sandwich is loaded with pesto and veggies, really nice, hearty yet not overly heavy.   Next time I'm going to expand my ordering a bit. Very confident they won't disappoint.

Wow.  For a place which advertises donuts and drive -thru service, you'd never expect the inside of this little gem to be as nice and mature as it is.  I was almost shocked when I walked in and saw dark wood paneling and tables, a very attractive counter and a very clean kitchen you can see right into.  That this is so close to my house that it may not be the best thing for me.  I guess I could work up a jogging to donuts routine.  How many donuts can you work off in a half mile? Everything I've had here has been simple and top-notch.  The donuts and other pastries have a fluffiness to them that can't be matched by donut chains, this place does it right.  And extra-right, they have freakin' donut samples on the counter while you decide what you want.  It is a pretty good guarantee that  you want a donut after that.  Wonderful coffee, not-overly cheery staff and a nice, relaxed atmosphere means I'll be coming back for lunch very soon.

These are some of the best bagels I've ever had and I'm a born and bred M.O.T., so trust me they are great.  Crusty on the outside, nice flavor and sweet and chewy on the inside.  They deli side is pretty good, only had breakfast sandwiches from them.  I get a dozen every few weeks and stick them in the fridge.  A little toasting and they return to their brilliance.  Hard to believe such good bagels exist in vapid NoPhx.  Thought the only stuff up there was giant corps and annoying hairstylists.  Side note:  The people who work there are not native English speakers, so when you whine to them over the phone about your order and complain, they might not totally understand you.  Oy.

Really 4 stars, but with only two reviews, I'm going to boost them up to an even 4.  Thai Basil is the 5th restaurant in the continuation of the empire of Thai Basil which is ravaging the valley.  Same great quality here.  Same freshness and variety of flavor that is known across campus.  What's an improvement to this one is this has bar and grill.  They have a nice small selection of beers and wines, including thai beer.  A few dishes differ from the other Thai Basils, including what I had, the Crying Tiger.  I had never heard of this.  What it was, was a grilled steak with a fresh green chili sauce.  Really tasty and fresh, the chilis being fresh brought a different spiciness, which can come back to haunt...   Went back for Happy Hour, which is from 4-6 every day but Sunday.  They have a nice selection of 1/2 off apps and also some salads (including the aforementioned Tiger).  Fresh salads for happy hour is a great addition to my after work snack repertoire.  $2 domestics and $3 imports (including Kirin)  Thai Basil has notoriously good veggies in their dishes, excellent curries and noodle dishes.  A good place to introduce newbies to Thai food and a place that will continually draw you back on weekday nights for hearty, healthy, tasty thai foods.

Phoenix, we need to seriously recognize that we have a great thing going here and exploit it.  We're humbly cool, our best restaurant is a pizza place, we're a tough crowd who has a artistic bent, we need to celebrate that.  Sucker Punch Sally's does.  So does the Roosevelt, Four Peaks, Fez, Stinkweeds, Hoodlums, Cowtown, Sunset Clothing, Frances, Honey Bears, Queen's Pizza, Lux, Pita Jungle...  If you haven't gleaned, I love this place.  I don't know the owners, they might not like me, as I'm a bit square, but I'm so happy they are taking this risk.  The use the Rockabilly motif and rock it out in spades.  Menu is standard diner fare, but with a twist.  They aren't running their full menu yet, smart move for a business getting on its feet in this economy, but what they are offering is good dinner food.  The three of us had a great time there.  $3 16oz Pabst, great loose meet sandwich and the homemade BBQ chips that came with it.  Had a bite of the Navajo Taco and the Pork Tenderloin sandwich, both very good and huge portions.  The rest of the menu is great too, chilli fries, wings (try the Sally's sauce), milkshakes and (thank the lord) affordable breakfast served all day.  They also have a full bar and soda fountain.  And they have a stage for live music.  And they are open 24 hours.  You know what else is open 24 hours in Phoenix?  F'ing McDisgustings and a bunch of crap Mex places.    Love Phoenix or Leave Phoenix (or make it somewhere you can love)

Ate here for like around the tenth time yesterday at midnight and it is as good as it ever was.  This is still the soft opening menu, but they are getting it right and making it righter.    Had the Mac and Cheese, friends had the burger, the chorizo omlette, the spicy Benedict, all were good.  The stand out is the apple pie, home made, huge and wonderful.  Service was good, real sweetheart and it made for a great night with a big group of friends.  Eggs to go? Why would you do such a thing?

Well, it seems like everyone from the mid-west is making their way out to Tempe these days.  I wonder, did Jimmy just come out for my wedding, or does he plan to stay?  No matter, each bite of Bootlegger with hot peppers today was a breath of wonderful, stinky Lake Michigan air.  Arizona needed a good kick in the sub pants by Jimmy Johns.  Most of our sub places here just don't match the quality, speed or service of JJ.  The ham is one thing which stands apart, really, it redefines sub shop ham, as it has more flavor and less gross flimsy questionable content of the usual sub shop ham.  Also, for some reason they have the best Coca-cola here.  No idea how they do it, maybe more syrup or something, but theirs is hands down the best for a chain place.  Writing that kind of grosses me out, but it is true.  The one thing about Jimmy Johns that never totally satisfies me is that they are not the perfect late-night snack but remain open late none-the-less, drawing my more inebriated self in repeatedly just to never fulfill my cravings.  Late night snacks sing to me of hot mashes of cheese, meet and starch (see: burrito, pizza, shwarma) and Jimmy John's cold quality, which is so great and easy for lunch, just doesn't cut the mustard on the chili-cheese fries.

The delicious meats, spreads and other concoctions are worth the trip.  The decor, the lighting, the location, not so much, but I put food over decor 9/10 times.  The restaurant that was in this location before left such a bad impression in my mind that I wanted to try this new one quickly. I'm really glad I did.  We went here for a quick bite and wound up having a feast.  Their menu is ambitious, many types of Middle Eastern and Greek influenced preparation styles, each achieved with great success.  The menu features everything east Mediterranean from lamb chops to kibbee to grape leaves to kafta.  The prices are a bit high, but when you look at what you get, it really is a good deal.  The owner was happy to beam about the fact that everything is brand new, everything is made in house and under his watch.  We had the platter for 2.  Now, I'm cheap and a grad student so $25 is a good chunk for a weekday dinner for me, but man was this a bargin.  1 of each: beef kabob, chicken kabob, chicken kafta, beef kafta, hummus plate, salad.  Huge stack of pita, 2 falafel and 2 beef kibbee.  Everything was excellent.  The kabobs were excellently grilled, the falafel was crispy on the outside, fresh and moist on the inside.  The sauces that came with (garlic, tdaziki and tahini) were all great for everything on the plates.  The decor needs a lady's touch and I really hope they spend a little cash in there to fix it up.  The location is prime for selling $5 gyro sandwiches til the cows come home (or at least til the lambs do), but if they want their excellent menu to keep the customers coming back they should fix the lighting and decor.  The old place was like a prison cafeteria, food included.  Out with the old!  I'll be going back for a sandwich for sure.  And with the combo for 2 coupon for $22 they gave us, we might be seeing the huge boxes of leftovers in our fridge again soon.

My definition of Central Phoenix ended at around the 12ths on both sides, but this place and Urban Beans have taught me the folly of my ways.  Condessa is a simple and beautiful spot, serving a different, more expansive menu than most of the other Mexican restaurants I've been sampling.  First impressions won me over on first step in, I am in love with the Dios los Muertos art aesthetic and they have some beautiful works adorning their walls and doors.  The self-described gourmet menu was enticing, many selections I've never seen in person, only read about in my food travel readings, so I was intrigued.  I really wish I was more hungry, I settled on the Queso which was recommended by my server.  The food takes a bit of time to prepare, but that does give you time to enjoy the salsa bar, which this day included 10 varieties including strawberry, chipolte, a creamy cilantro, guac, pico, can't remember them all.  When my Queso came I was a bit shocked by it's size and relativity to fry-bread, not that this is a bad thing.  The pork inside was unbelievable, comparable in portion size and taste to that of much more expensive places.  Fried cheesy porky goodness, topped with rotating different salsas, each bite was another slice of heaven.  My gripes:  I have much respect for the work they put in to make this food outstanding, but they are shooting themselves in the foot with the plastic silverware,  cheap baskets and togo cups.  I know doing dishes is annoying, but you need to match your great food with great accoutrement.  After writing this, I'm going back today.  Yum.

Only a fan of the drinks and music, haven't been too happy with the food.  However, for the price, the food is fine.  I'm just really impressed with the music I've seen here and how there is never a cover.  I was skeptical about this place when it first opened, but the staff has changed over for the better and the tap selection has improved as well.  Long live Tempe's actual downtown, the Apache Corridor.

When I saw that ASU had decided to put in a hotdog stand within sight of my office window, I became concerned for my arteries.  Luckily, however, they also put in E2.  E2, I believe, means the second incarnation of the Engrained restaurant in ASU's MU building, which focuses on local and organic healthy foods.  E2 takes up the same mantra, but offers less (due to its size and focus on speed).  In the what has become my crisis of conscience corner, I have reluctantly chosen E2 over the hotdog place every time.  Devil be damned.  I'm afraid that the food at E2 isn't all that stellar however.  I have enjoyed the morning yogurt, but they do over sweeten it a bit.  That's not to my taste, but they will probably sell a ton of it to frappachino types.  The sandwiches I've had have been premade, making the bread a bad texture from refrigeration and the bottom layer always soggy from the dressing they use.  The drinks here are great, as are the pastries.  The green tea is delicious and keeps me going for hours.    4 stars because I applaud the attempt to make campus healthier, but not 5 because I feel like the menu design is all talk and not actually tested on a daily basis.

Yes, I get the hype, Short Leash is a welcome addition to the Phoenix food scene, but I don't think this is the perfect food cart by any means.  The dogs are delicious, I love the local-organic focus, and the cart itself is very attractive.  I just can't seem to justify 5 stars, here's why:  The dogs are much smaller than the naan, leaving lots of bread and toppings left over.  The naan could be adjusted for the dogs a bit, I mean, if you're going to go to the trouble...  The naan is good but mine was kind of undercooked, leaving some bites overly chewy.  The toppings don't all fuse together that well, leaving much of them to drop out of the bread.  I wasn't given a fork and was left scrambling for beans.  I welcome Short Leash and wish them well, but don't go thinking it's going to revolutionize hot dogs, it's just a good dog.  Worth $5?  Maybe if the dogs were a bit bigger.

Yeah, Yelp led me a little wrong here, as did the menu.  Was looking for a hungover guilty gorging of dogs and tots, ended up feeling worse than when I went in.  The owner is a nice guy, who is trying very hard, but they are missing some things.  First off, the hotdog quality just isn't good.  "Boiled bologna" is how my date described it, and she hit it right on the money.  The toppings were pretty good, very sugary and sweet.  We had three dogs and tots.  The dogs were luke warm, not grilled to order, not even really done.  The buns are good, very sweet too.  Here's my thoughts: increase the quality of the dogs and show that off, doesn't have to be organic, but should be a good name.  Grill the dogs to order, takes a few more minutes but I'd come back for it.  Make sure everything that is supposed to be hot is hot (chili, tots, etc.) and everything cold is cold (slaw).  It's that difference in temp that makes a great eating experience.  Yeah, maybe I'm being a picky jerk, but I'd like the place to succeed.

Just writing a quick one to say, "Stop taking down a restaurant that just opened with nit picky and whiny reviews."  Rice Paper does a good job of serving Vietnamese favorites in a fun, hip environment.   The thing that is 5 stars about this place is that they serve quality sandwiches.  Theirs are better than all of the other (like 3) that I've tried in Phoenix.  Celebrate the Bahn Mi, the best sandwich in the world.

Bragg's Pie Factory is a pretty amazing place.  Right in the heat of Grand Ave's eclectic art scene this former confection creation station is now a very cool, very open and airy art space.  I rented the space for a modest sum to throw a party there for the Phoenix Fringe Festival's closing night and it couldn't have gone better.  There is currently a mutant pinata show going on (stop by, you can see it from the street!) and that made for a really fun vibe for the party.  The owner, Beatrice (go visit her at Kooky Krafts up the street) was very accommodating and positive about the whole experience.  Beatrice is an energy all her own on Grand Ave., really working to reuse and rehab the marvelous old buildings from Phoenix's former main-drag.   The building itself is a giant open front room with other, similarly large back rooms which house local businesses.  The front room, the one we rented, is about a football field in size, stark white with polished concrete floors.  It feels big when you're in it, but we were able to use some select lighting (Xmas lights are your friend) to make the space somewhat intimate.  Rock on Pie Factory, rock on.
