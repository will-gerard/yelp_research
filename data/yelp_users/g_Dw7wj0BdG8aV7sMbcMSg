This review is really for the hidden treasure that is the little nail salon inside Raw. Sally who is one of best nail people I know and I recommend her to all my friends. She works only by appointment and one client at a time so you know your in for top service. I hope you'll give her a buzz and that you have a great experience like I have. ~Zoe

Okay this guy is awesome and I plan on asking him to do my wedding. I have used Jeremiah for years and I have never been disappointed. From that birthday gift to just something to say I care. he can whip up something in a heart beat and will work with your budget too.

Well this place is not a palace but it's got great food and has allot of locals that go there. It's one of the few places I've ever seen that have a large Asian patronage that fill the place up, To me this is a very good sign as I know that the food authentic and not very overly westernized. The food is awesome and very large portions and the eggrolls are to die for. The menu has a few exotic items and there are non-menu items that are offered and if you can read Chinese there are menu posters that have more intersting dishes for the more brave. As for fresh seafood some you can't get any fresher as there tanks in the reception area filled with crabs, lobsters, fish, and large prawns. The cons. of the place is that it's not one of the cleanest places I have eaten at and service can be slow and awkward due to the wade staff having a slight language barrier. The water is not very tasty as it's tap and so is the ice, So I would suggest if you come here and you should, don't be in a hurry and be exact on your orders and you'll have a great meal. Also have a open mind and a empty tummy too ;-)

Well lets just say I'm not impressed and I will go back one more time to try dim sum, but so far this place has pretty average food and mostly tastes like it comes out of a mix. The dinning room is large and utilitarian but not very fancy but that don't make food good either LOL. Portions are small and the rice is inedible and not very tasty.  Service was poor and infrequent. All in all I do not recommend this place

SWIHA and there sister school SWINA are by far the best school I have ever attended. They have everything that could be found in the area of healing arts and natural aesthetics. The school is open minded and taking on new idea's in health and well being of the human condition and is constantly evolving. There is a term at these school that is used for lots of there students that seem to not be able to leave and continue to enroll in classes "lifers" and I would encourage you to become one of these "lifers" as this school gets so addicting to attend.

No dice , cold veal and burnt pizza all in one meal on a typical  Friday night.... Fail ! New owners have killed this popular spot for me permanently.  We went with a bunch of friends to celebrate one of their birthdays and received very little to no service at all. Took 30 mins to get our drinks and after 50 mins we received our orders. Two were luke warm and one of the pizza's were burnt and un-edible and the other pizza was like shoe leather and obviously was frozen dough. When asked about it the management was rude and defended the service and did not offer to help other than to say sorry and better luck next time and made us pay the full bill.

A must visit in this hot weather, with all the old school style icecream parlor with a modern coffee shop flair.

I've been seeing Dr. Kline for years and I've never had a doctor as professional and knowledgeable as he is. He's the very rare country style doctor you hear about, caring and strait to the point and respectful. All cases are personal and he takes the time to address all of your issues, including the ones that you didn't know you had because a previous doctor blew it off as nothing.   Overall you can't get a better family practice that Prime Medical.
