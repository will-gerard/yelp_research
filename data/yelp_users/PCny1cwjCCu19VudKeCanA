Is no stars an option?! WORST CAB RIDE EVER. Guy was a huge jerk to my grandma and me when we got picked up from the airport. HUGE jerk. I would recommend calling your hotel or a friend to come pick you up over using these jerkfaces.

LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Staff was incredibly friendly, our coffee was never less than half gone before it was instantly refilled, the food was a caloric festival of the stomach, the clientele made people watching amazing. Omg. We went two mornings in a row. The biscuits are divine. I had the Texas Toast something and my boyfriend the melt something. It was beyond words. We walked in and were greeted by no less than five people. It was clearly a hot spot for the locals, and I watched the staff be extremely accommodating with an older disabled couple that nearly made me cry. Amazing music selection due to the jukebox, so be sure to bring your quarters!!!

I loved this spot! We had such great service on a lazy Sunday night during Spring Training. HIt up the karaoke and LOTS of booze. So much fun. Seems like a good local spot and next time I'm in Spring Training, I will be going back.

LOVE IT!!! The staff was SO friendly I kept thinking they were trying to sell me something. The food isn't amazing, the prices are less than AT&T Park though. We loved being so close to the players. Arrive early to get autographs and make it worth your while. All the vendors in the stands have great personalities and flair, which makes it interesting. We had an amazing time and I can't wait for regular season to start, and to go to back to Spring Training next year!

So awesome! I wish I could have spent more time walking around, at least just window shopping. Can't wait to get back!
