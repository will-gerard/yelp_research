Great for kids. For the low price of $1.99 each I can feed my kiddos veggies drinks dessert. Cheaper than fast food and just as fast.  The place is always clean and friendly. The food is ok and there are certainly enough choices to satisfy and age or diet.

We have been going here since the 90s and its the  same.  We start with the combo apps, I love the Ranch dressing here.  Now its hot when you bite into those lovely zucchini and mushrooms so cut them open first.   We then get 2 chickens, so we have some to take home,  Love the Coleslaw!  The fired chicken is fresh and hot!  So good.  I love the BBQ sauce as well.  Worth the 50 miles trek to this little place.

We eat here once a week.  Love it, we eat late and at 8pm they are not too busy but the staff is still attentive.  I always get the Macha and if you haven't had it, OMG is it good.  They stuff it inside a chimi and smother in cheese and sour cream.  how do you not love that.  plus they have veggies if your not in favor of the beans.  Huge portion, always have left overs and reheats well. My hubby gets the massive portions of fajitas and they are always hot!  The chips are so good and the salsa comes in a large bowl not a little dish.  Great service to.

First great service! Our waitress filled our teas and was just wonderful.  Even brought us a to go ice tea. The appetizer was the fried calamari.  I would call it a 3.5 it was tough and chewy and greasy. I ordered the Chicken Pasta dish and I give it a 5/5. Big portion great flavors. My husband had the Cajun Combo. He loved the catfish but the shrimp portion had a huge pile of white rice with tomatoes and then 5 little shrimp. Still a great value and well done. I recommend sitting in the back as its a noisy place but great atmosphere.

They ran out of the Harvest Ingredients for the Panini, they were slow, and the portions are small, not impressed.  The restaurant was clean so that is a plus, but the staff doesn't understand the menu.  I ended up ordering the cranberry turkey which is good, but the size doesnt match the price.

Amber is amazing she has done 2 so far for my family including Prom and my son's senior pictures. Not only is she incredible but she's a truly wonderful person. Flexible with times as well. She has an eye for right background and we'll as lighting. She has creative ideas and is easy to work with. She was extremely patient with a group of teens getting the Prom photos and came up with excellent ideas.  She took so many pictures too. Her pricing is so reasonable I cannot wait for our family holiday photos.
