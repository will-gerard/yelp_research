I was so pleased with the work I got from Mel and guys at Andy's. I had to have my hood and my front bumper repaired. My hood had been damaged before and the estimate I got to fix it was $1500. I lived with it. Then I got in a finder bender that my insurance company would not cover because the $900 cost to fix the bumper, from the shop they sent me to, was less then my deductible. I checked around to see what other companies would charge to repair both since I was paying it myself. I did find a cheaper quote, but really questioned the quality of the final repair. And if found a couple just a little higher than I got here. The total estimate I got from Andy's was right at $1000. I had seen good reviews and I could see the quality of the operation they had and the integrity of the people I dealt with. So I chose to have them fix my car. After I agree to the estimate they gave me, Mel called me the day I was bringing in my car and told me he had worked the weekend and found an a new overstocked hood to replace mine, the quote was to repair my old hood. I was worried they were going to try to charge me more money. When I got there he showed me that it was my choice, but the way he reworked the new estimate it would be only $8 more.  I was so pleased with the job they did. My car is a 2012, but it looks brand new. I would go there again (but I hope I don''t have to!!)

Went in for a beer after I hiked Squaw Peak, had seen this place on Yelp since it was near my house.  The other customers were very nice, the bartender was not. The happy hour prices were not even that good, I could walk to 4 places near by that are more friendly and have better HH.

Tonight begins Arizona restaurant week. I have some friends in town and they wanted to try this Morton's. I have eaten at Morton's in Chicago and in Kansas City but I have never eaten at this location. Sometimes it's good with our restaurant week to try a restaurant that you have not tried before.  Or in this case to eat at a restaurant that you know you will never eat at again This restaurant is like stepping back in time, but not in a good way. Very low ceilings very dark restaurant. And even though it was a Friday night and the beginning of restaurant week the place was virtually empty. I only saw one person sitting in the bar. The waitstaff had an irritating air to them. As if they were something incredibly special, in spite of the fact that the place was merely a graveyard. When we asked for the restaurant week menu, which they did not want to give us, they only brought one menu for the entire table. I had the double Porkchop and it was in fact quite good. But everything else was average if not worse. The salads were soaked in dressing and did not have any sense of freshness. The Brockley was steamed but it was nearly flavorless.  Sadly, the coffee that they served with dessert was one of the most flavorful items of the evening. This is a chain that has slipped away into bad ownership. It is grossly overpriced and the competition is obviously killing it  Save yourself the time and money and pick a different restaurant

Here last night using a Groupon. It was for $50. We had one appetizer and a couple margaritas, two entr√©es and our bill was over $100 easy for the Groupon.  And if the food has been all is good or outstanding me I could have stomached the price. But the truth was the food was average at best probably overpriced. There were very few people in the restaurant and yes the service was incredibly slow and not overly friendly. I would not recommend this restaurant to my friends.

My buddy wanted to meet for lunch. We were going to eat at another restaurant in this complex. Then he saw a sign that said "gourmet burgers and brews", he thought it was a new restaurant and told me to meet him there. It ended up being Red Robin. I have eaten there once or twice before and not been very excited about the food, but we were already here and I wasn't going to complain. I don't often eat hamburgers with a bun, since I do not eat a lot of bread or pasta or rice and things like that. But I ended up having a A bacon cheeseburger with blue cheese that was absolutely decadent. I even had onion rings. The burger was so filling I only ate half of it. The wait staff was very attentive.  Overall I was very pleased with our lunch. And that's why I gave it four stars

We had a fun time, late-nite and the crowd was very crazy which made it all the more fun. Just sat in the bar/lobby didn't go for a film, will have to do that next time.

I am giving them two stars not because of the coffee. I enjoyed their coffee, there are some small coffee shops that I prefer, but whenever I go to Starbucks I know I'm going to get a nice hearty cup.  They sent me a coupon to have a free breakfast this morning. So I had a sausage, egg, cheese English muffin. I don't often eat these but from time to time I will break down and get one from McDonald's. The cost of the Starbucks McMuffin is much higher then the McDonals and it is nowhere near as tasty. They do not have food offering as good as their coffee, in my opinion

Forge Pizza in Phoenix officially closed business today 2/1/16. Sadly that spot on the Biltmore Shopping Center was not good for them.

What a wonderful surprise. And this is the best Ethiopian food you'll find in Arizona. It is a new family owned business, that is a real gem. The family, being from Ethiopia, found no real Ethiopian food in the valley, and thus opened Abyssinia Ethiopian Restaurant.  I found it because they currently are on restaurant.com. I did some research and realized how wonderful this place is. It's in a simple strip mall, a place you would not even notice if you were not heading there.  This is not fast food, they made everything we ordered to order. And if you are up to it, they serve like you would get at their home- no plates, or silverware. Eating with your hands with that wonderful Inerja bread adds to the whole experience. By the time we left the restaurant was relatively full, Filled with lots of neighbors who also probably grew up in Ethiopia. I love to support local businesses and especially family owned businesses. Give this one a chance

I've always enjoyed Postino's happy hour. I did not try the new location here in old town Scottsdale until earlier this week. Then I find myself here again in a couple days. These are my two favorite bruschetta with a nice IPA
