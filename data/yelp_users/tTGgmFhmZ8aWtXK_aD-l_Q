Finally had the chance to experience Jollibee. The chicken was okay, although we had to wait 10 minutes for it. I ordered a 2 piece meal which comes with a drink, but I don't like to order soda so I asked for water instead. I don't mind paying the combo price even though I drink water. They gave me a styrofoam cup for my water instead of a regular drink sized cup.  :/  I also ordered the chicken dippers, and they filled the honey mustard dip with enough sauce to use on maybe half of one tender (there were three total). The photos of their chicken combo meals show rice and a side of gravy, or maybe it's mashed potatoes under the gravy; but it's technically not part of your order. You get either one or two sides when you buy the combo, so you have to pick rice, gravy or whatever else you want as a side.    :/ Well at least I can say I've been there.

Delicious Korean goodness. Great location near Leelees. The ambience is chill, and it's not BBQ smokey like other Korean restaurants (I'm not complaining). Hip joint that plays K-Pop. Pricing is reasonable.
