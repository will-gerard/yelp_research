Dont go during the day! My girlfriend has weekdays off so we like to go day drink and have lunch. We have had one good experience here but after two more tries it has been horrible. The first time they said they were out of 32 oz beer cups so we asked if we could have two 16 oz beers for the 32 oz price, he said no way. The bartender and cook were so busy watching I robot on tv I had to ask for more beer and ask to order. The wings weren't even trimmed! They were still connected to the drum! Gross! I then had to go find the bartender to ask for my bill. The second time was the same thing just a different bartender. He was screaming on the phone about some vender and we had to once again interupt their tv time to get more beer. Just rediculous. I was afraid to order food because when we asked for menus he pretty much threw them at us and dissapeared. We then 30 min later decided to ask if we could order. I don't get it if you want to make a bigger tip increase the check total duh. Once again we had to interupt tv time to get our check. I will never be back during the day for lunch ever again. It is insulting how they treat you like you are keeping them from their daytime show. My advice to the owner is fire all the male bartenders, hire new bartenders that actually want to make money. And don't let them watch movies while customers are waiting for drinks. You are trying to make money right??

Cut my chin open on the rainbow racers. Was bleeding and the lifeguards did nothing just called an emt. He took me to the first aid station and couldn't get the not waterproof bandaids or butterfly closures to stick my girlfriends mom is a cna and she did all the work while they sat there and watched. No incident report nothing was done. We left and came back around 2 we got there at 1030 and I was hurt around 11. Our cabana was covered in ants but I didn't say anything I was bleeding and it wasn't really stopping. I email customer support and randy called we to speak. I met him and he appologized and said the emt said he offered us an incident report which he didn't. He offered to give me a 50 percent refund on our cabana. I told him can you just upgrade our passes to season passes so we can come back. He came back and said he would only charge us 20 bucks a peice for season passes nice upsell on the injured guest! I took him up on it just to be able to recover the 250 bucks I spent but man no water proof bandaids? And who is the emt that couldn't even help me? Then you basically call me a liar and upsell me season passes? You should be careful if I was a lawyer or had legal counsel this could have gone different. I like the park for what it is but the first aid shack is a joke should have been able to at least stop the bleeding he did nothing to help me. Randy was nice and all but take care of your customers fill out an incident report etc etc etc.

Well, after about 8 visits, I am moving on to the next bar. Why is it so hard to find a bar where you can get great service, great food, and fast drinks? I own a restauarant in North Scottsdale, and work ALOT. So at the most 2 or 3 time a week a beer or three is needed after work. I always go alone, and have met some great friends at Twin Peaks. The beer is cold. That being said, the girls that work there have the business all wrong. I had the same problem at kilt. I don't care if you wear a sweater I just want good service! I usually have to clean the bar where I sit, ask for a menu if I dare eat, and am always getting treated like a loser. They give you nasty looks, have no personality, and seem like its the worst place to work ever. Manager comes out every hour to play on the computer and talk to noone. Why not ask the customer how their experience is? From what I can see here, you will still get the dirtbags that like to throw coasters at the girls and get the dirty looks, but us industry people know better. We want good service and we will continue to hop until we find it. One things for sure over my last 8 visits, it isn't here, it isn't a bad night, and I won't be wasting the little time I get to be treated like this, ever again. Best of luck to you, I hope you can find better service staff because if you don't your destined to be stocking up on Budweiser.
