Thin crust pizza was horrible. Waitress had a big nose ring through her septum...turned my stomach. Can't eat and look at that. She checked our table once. Horrible service. She was friendly, of course.

It was just ok. Nothing exciting in any way. The Spanish rice was mediocre and there were green beans in it? ? The refried beans were very runny. I ordered the chicken street tacos. Absolutely nothing special or impressive. The chicken was dry.

I went to Gammage last night to see Sandra Day O'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsberg. About a month ago I broke my kneecap and I am still in a straight leg brace. The floor managers went above and beyond to help me find a seat, and even managed to help me elevate my leg by providing a chair to rest it on.  If all managers in any business were as kind as this crew, service in Arizona would be exceptional! Bravo to Gammage for employing such exceptional individuals !  One side note, the sound was terrible. I couldn't hear half the words spoken. I heard an elderly couple state they only heard about ten percent of what was said. I hope Gammage can address the issue they seem to have with the sound.

If you just imagine you're in mainland China, this will feel right. Service is a bit strange,  but it's traditional Chinese service. I come for the ever elusive, hard to find chichen chop suey, and I love it !

Fabulous pizza crust, just like the reviews said! I don't normally eat the crust, but I did eat this crust! I got the Margareta pizza, but added sauce, and my husband built his own. We both loved or pizzas. You could just tell the ingredients were quality! Tasted so good! We also tried the cauliflower as an opener. It was good, but nothing I'll die if I don't have it again. We prefer our cauliflower a little more cooked.  The service was just fabulous from the moment we walked in the door.

Love the bruschetta  chicken burger!  And Travis,  our server,  was exceptional!  Never an empty glass at the table,  and remembered the extra ranch we ordered. I wish I had this great service every time I went out to eat.

Went here because we bought the living social deal. This place was AMAZING!  My husband and I shared the schwarma combo and it was more than enough food. Everything about the combo was fantastic and extremely flavorful. I like extra cucumbers, so I ordered the side of tomatoes and cucumbers, which made the meal just perfect for me. I also ordered the mango smoothie with amaretto. It was served in a tall glass  and you can bet it was empty by the time I was done. You will be so happy you tried this place! I even enjoyed the music and atmosphere on a Friday night  ((Good Friday). We missed the belly dancing at 730, but we were done eating by 845, and the restaurant was just starting to pick up because they were having salsa dancing lessons later!

Such a lovely spot. We were greeted as we came in. It was dinner time and they were pretty busy. After we were seated, we were asked if we wanted the buffet. We decided to try it. Great service. Very, very attentive. Our drinks were never empty and the complimentary bread served at the table was delicious. We will certainly be back!

I ordered the Primavera. So fabulous. Had bread with some oil pesto dip. Overcast November day,  great service. Couldn't have asked for more.

Authentic street tacos. They cook fresh meat right here on the grill. Traditional Mexican garnishments. We will definitely be back. I had the chicken tacos, my husband had the chicken burrito. Both were great.

Went there this evening with a friend at 4 pm. Sat out on the patio, which was really nice...for a while. By 5, loud and obnoxious people surrounded us. I did not like the atmosphere at all. I also wish I had known smoking was allowed on the patio before I was seated there. The staff was super friendly and attentive. Try the street tacos! They were great!

Two words. Pork avodado. The most amazing thing I've eaten in a long time. The side of rice was only ok. The chicken guild and lamb tacos were nothing special,  but that pork!!! Amazing! !! A bit loud on a Friday night with the live dj in a small space. . . But that pork is enough to pull a 4 star and I'll be back! !

Absolutely love Essence bakery! Tried it for the first time today. The blueberry lemon brioche was amazing! The almond croissant was good, as well.

All things aside, this was our first visit and it was delicious. I had a gyro... kind of (explained later), and the spinach rice. It was so fantastic and full of flavor!   We ordered the chicken simosa, which the waitress said was an appetizer. It was served AFTER we already started our main course. Wish they would have brought it out earlier.  Also, the waitress (Polish lady) was very nice, but in too much of a hurry to explain things well.  She knew this was our first visit. I said I wanted a gyro. She asked if I wanted the sandwich or combo platter. I asked what the difference was. She said the combo was served with rice. So I ordered the combo.  When we got our food, there was no sandwich.  Just meat on top of rice.  When I explained we may have miscommunicated, they were nice and said they would give me a sandwich. I said,  don't worry about it, just bring me bread and I'll make it myself. They asked if I wanted pita or naan bread.  I said naan. I wish they would have told me it was heated with butter or oil. When they finally brought it out, it was too crisp to make a gyro from. So, I cut it up into pieces to eat with my meat.  So,  fantastic food, but a little lacking in service. I will come back and try it again!

Better waitress than the first time. Ordered Rania's gyro instead of the gyro platter... MUCH better option for me. Fabulous visit and I will come again and again. Such amazingly flavorful food! !!

Had a great time painting this evening!  The ladies were very friendly and helpful! Casual atmosphere and fun subject to paint.  The only thing I could suggest is a bit more direction would be helpful. Sometimes it was unclear what I was doing next.  For a fun time, call Wine and Design!

Nice atmosphere. Sat outside on Valentine's Day. Ordered pizza. Loved the crust.  Next time I'll order extra sauce. A little light.

Tried the plain old burger, which comes with lettuce, tomato, mayo,  and added havarti cheese. Ordered it medium -well. It was really great. I'm not a big burger fan, mostly because I've never found a great burger. This was a tender, well cooked burger. Really happy with my choice and will order it again. Liked the zucchini fries, too, though a little on the thin and limp-side for my liking. Not greasy, but definitely could be improved upon.
