I liked the bruschetta.  It was fun sitting outside and enjoying the atmosphere.  Very trendy.  It was nice enjoying a meal while catching up with my girlfriend here.

The paradise bakery chain is good. But as a former employee there, its because they load everything, including the bread with sugar. At the end of the day they throw out hundreds of cookies, which I would donate the day old cookies to underpriveldged families.  If u call ahead of time, the employees will save the day old pastries and cookies for u if u intend to donate it or contribute it toward a good cause.  All paradise bakeries are busy! The amount of kitchen and walkway space behind the counter is so crowded and gets messy fast. Because it was so busy, we would wait until we closed to clean the dishes. Because we did it all at once, the dishes were cleaned in disgusting brown water. The rags we used to clean knives, tables, chairs and counters were soaked in dirty brown water of "sanitizing" buckets on the floor with bits of food floating in them. Because paradise bakery is open so late, until ten or eleven, the workers want to get out of there and would sabotage your food if you came in close to closing time. I saw the workers drop their bread on the floor and soak the plastic salad bowls in the brown water of the "sanitizing" buckets.   I stopped working there because I found a job with better pay, but after seeing how gross the conditions were, I never ate there again.  Overall, its unclean, over priced, busy and loaded with sugar....but the food is good.

The groomers there werent very nice to my dog, hes very sweet and well behaved. When I got my cat groomed she still had loose hairs all over her. However, there hours are great! 8 am-8 pm. It cost about $65 bucks to bathe and groom my cat. More money for my dogs.

The workers were nice; however, the wait really wasn't worth it. This place is so crowded. They entice customers with great deals but if you need an eye exam for glasses and contacts, then you really don't save any money. I paid just as much here as I did on my Burberry glasses and contacts at nationwide vision. Although the people are nicer here, I am sticking with nationwide because they have more locations and the prices are comparable. Maybe if you need glasses and not contacts this place will be a good deal.

Used to work at the desert ridge location until it closed down after only a few months. I had a manager Leah who acted very peppy and up beat to customers and would criticize them (f bombs and all) over the headset as they walked away...she seriously had a dark soul to be working at the Disney store. They try to hand you bags, because you are more likely to buy more if you put your items in a bag. Be careful about bringing little ones, because if they ask you for something and you say no, workers aka cast members are trained to chime in with retaliations like, "its a saLe item for a limited time only" etc.   Advice for shoppers: When Disney wants to get rid of items they will practically give the items away through their awesome sales. Also, be conscious that Disney is a master of packaging. Things may be presented well in the store and packaged neat, but you bring it home, tear the cardboard and plastic off and you are left with a dinky toy that you paid too much for.   Overall, everyone loves Disney and its a magical unique experience that can't be replicated. Just don't spend too much time shopping because the high school musical videos they play on a loop at the store will drive you nuts. :)

Instead of calling it "breakfast," Orange Table should call it "break-slow."  It took an hour to get our food. 30 min to get our drinks and 20min to get water (which they never refilled).   We ordered the artisan tuna melt, the banana foster French toast and for drinks we got the Mexican chocolate latte (not that great) and the smoca mocha latte. The bananas foster French toast tasted like I was eating spoonfuls of sugar. It was also very burnt. I love sweet things but this was too much. The tuna melt was good.   They discounted our food, not our drinks.  Wish I could say I won't be back but we bought two groupons for this place.  Maybe we will call in a Togo order 2 hours prior to meal time.   I was very surprised because this place received many awards. The place was very crowded, but I think that is because the customers had to wait for their food so long.    I would recommend the nearby restaurant, daily dose, over this place.

Terrific drive thru stop on Scottsdale road. Great location and I absolutely love their popcorn shrimp and dipped cones. I am amaze at how big the large dipped cone is. I'm partial to strawberry, but the chocolate dipped cone is like an ice cream brownie! Great hours too.

Finally! A place close by that sells conoli shells and sweet potato gnocchi!   I had the tuna salad with a white and milk chocolate cookie. My boyfriend had the gnocchi Alfredo and a conoli. I would have posted a photo of our food but we ate it too fast ;)   I will definitely be back to try the lemon bars.

Went here because I had a groupon.  Every time I walked in no one was at the front desk.  I had to say, "Hello?" for an employee to come out from the back room, walk to the front desk and check me in almost every time I went to tan.  While tanning in the beds, I heard cracking sounds from the plastic of the bed (I'm not at all overweight.)  If you need to use their restroom, you have to go to a gross one downstairs. They had a sale where their tanning lotions were 30% off.  After the discount, they were $70.  I was suckered into buying one. Then I checked amazon and they were $24.50.  Ugh these guys are a rip off.

We ordered a slice of pizza and drink combo for about 3.50 after tax. Yummy! I got the lingonberry drink which was delish.  They also have a Swedish grocery market!   We came for furniture and ended up furnishing our place, eating lunch and grocery shopping at ikea. If that's not the epitome of corporate up selling, what is?  :)

The veggie sandwich was great. Not your typical sandwich with veggies in place of meat. Taste was actually taken into account. My meat eating friends even order the veggie sandwich. It's that good.  The waitress was very nice, personable and friendly.

Not bad for a place to eat on my lunch break. I got the vegetable bowl (regular size) with rice it was only 2.99. So, I added the egg rolls. Very yummy. Will have it again!

If I could give this company zero stars I would. Sylvester "WOJO" Wojtowicz is your quintessential two faced greedy salesperson. You cannot trust him. How he sleeps at night is a mystery.    My mother had three brain surgeries from an unexpected aneurysm.  I am 23 and the only family my mother has. The responsibility of moving and closing fell on me.   Sylvester rushed me to move. I moved all of my mother's things in a hurried panic and hired a cleaning crew to ensure everything was pristine. I even took weeks off of work.  It turns out, I had an extra week to move her things. Sylvester rushed me to receive his commission check sooner.   He also said that he would call the moving company (that he suggested) to get an invoice. This way, I could take the moving costs out of the closing cost so I could be reimbursed.  Instead of doing what he said he would do, he arrived at my mothers rehab facility (5 hours ahead of our schedule appointment) when I wasn't there and rushed to get the final documents signed to get his commission check. How a notary approved a brain damaged woman who struggles to complete sentences is beyond me.   Once he got his check, his tune completely changed. He proceeded with rude text messages on a Friday evening.   On top of everything, the movers he suggested damaged a lot of my mothers things and furniture. Stay far away from this greedy selfish individual.

I am a crafts person and the store is close to my house so I continue to go here despite the crummy service. The workers dont really know what they are talking about and are mostly old ladies. The half dead old ladies are the only ones that work the register and their slowness causes a huge line all the time. Once there was an old lady slowly working the cash register with a giant line. While the old fat managers with their headsets just stood around and watched, instead of hopping on one of the empty registers to help the customers waiting in the long line. Their coupons have crazy policies. My friend used to work there, but they accused her of taking reciepts (why would she take reciepts?) So she decided to leave the company after years of working there.  They dont have much doll stuff, resin or resin mold but they r good for scrapbooking and faux flowers.

Im an ASU student and I have only heard great things about this place. I had a float with pineapple ice cream and orange fanta. So yummy. They also have cookie and ice cream sandwaitches and smoothies. The owner was very kind and outgoing. He was thankful for our business. It made me feel like I was in a 1950s mom and pop ice cream shop. Casual, affordable, fun place to grab some dessert after dinner while strolling along mill ave. great location. U can walk to it from asu after class.

Wasn't impressed with the food. The grouper tasted like they dumped salt on a fish and put it in the oven. The dumplings it came with weren't very good either. It took way too long to get our food. When the bus boy took our appetizer plates away he took our forks so we were waiting around with our entree plates of food with no silverware to eat it with. Go to citizen public house. It's close by and the food is much better.

Had the zuccini linguini. Great! Heathy, made me full fast. They have raw and vegan options. The chi tea was a coffee flavored caffine free tea. Also very good. Will come back.

The staff was really nice and helpful. One young woman working there noticed I was trying to find my size and she came over and started helping me look. They have some really cute things. I am 23 and buy inexpensive things for myself as well as my 13 year old sister.  The only thing that sucks is that you cannot return things even with a receipt. You can only get store credit. This excludes jewelry. Jewelry is final sale.

Gabriel, the locksmith was great!  What had happened is that the key to my car fell off my keychain. I had no spare key.  The dealership said they would have to put a new locking system in my car. They said it would cost $1400. Fortunately, Gabriel fixed everything.  There were no codes on the parts in my car so it took him extra time figure everything out. He was nice, knowledgeable and it only cost $185.  I was very thankful!

Honestly, I love living here. Freddy on staff is the nicest guy ever! I think the front office is understaffed and when we initially walked in to the leasing office no one was there because there was someone helping other customers. But thats corporates issue...the staff working is really helpful. If there's a problem it is fixed immediately.

Yummy Bloody Mary drinks during happy hour. I also enjoy their vegetarian pizza options. The atmosphere is very fun with colorful urban art including skateboards as canvases. Fun place to meet up with friends.

Love the new York and Vegas rolls. I don't like how they waste so much styrofoam but overall a yummy place and close to the design building. Prepare to wait a while for your food though. If you go there frequently, ask for a stamp card.

Neat coffee place that also serves beer!  I like the industrial look to their shops.  It's just a little pricey.

Employees need serious training!!!! This place is close to my work and EVERY TIME I go they screw up my drink. I order a Very Berry Hibiscus Refresher (so not a super complicated drink.) It takes them at least three times to make it.  They are constantly dumping out drinks and starting over while a long line is waiting . when they hand my drink to me it tastes different (bad different) every time. Today, it tasted like chemicals. They have a metal stir stick that they put in blue sanitizing liquid, I think they got too much of that sanitizer in my drink. Today, I ordered a birthday cake pop and they use a piece of tissue to place it in the bag, well, the guy left the tissue in the bag so the germs from the employees hand got all over my cake pop. I didn't say anything but seriously, get your stuff together! Whoever is the manager of this location should be exiled to McCafe.
