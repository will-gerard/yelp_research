Came Here Tonight For My Anniversary Dinner With My Beautiful Girlfriend. The Staff Was Beyond Friendly From The Time We Walked In. We Had Jeremy, The Bar Manager, As Our Server Tonight & He Was Great. Our Food Came Out Quickly & Our Drinks Were Always Full. Not To Mention The Food Being Amazing. Overall A Very Great Experience & We Will For Sure Be Back. Thank You Melting Pot.

Last night was my first time here & it will for sure be my last. I went for dinner with my girlfriend & my mom but none of us were happy with the food or service. It took us at least 10 minutes just to get water. The server started to take the order of a table that had been seated way after us, but we spoke up about it. Even though he stopped & took our order first, the other table still received their food first. The food didn't have much flavor. I had the Chicken Pho & was extremely disappointed after waiting for so long.

I haven't been here in years but went yesterday for happy hour. Now I know exactly why I haven't been here in so long. The sushi is OK but the service was terrible. We never received our edamame or our soy sauce for the sushi. It also took forever to get change back from our bill. I will never step foot into this place ever again.

This was my first time here & it will probably be my only time. The fresh spring rolls were good, the Pho was OK but the service was really bad. There were only a few people there but they still managed to forget our coffee. Not a good first impression at all.

I've had plenty of pizza in my life but I have to say that this is the best pizza there is! My favorites are the Italian Stallion & The Dolce Diavolo, but you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.

I haven't been here in a month or so but it was even better than I remembered. I ordered the chicken burrito this time & it was delicious. The best burritos in town! The staff is always friendly, the place is always clean & they play great music. If you haven't been here yet you need to make it a point to visit. You will not be dissapointed.
