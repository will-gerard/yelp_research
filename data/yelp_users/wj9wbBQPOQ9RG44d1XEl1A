This place has an amazing selection of wines and he bruschetta is delicious! We ended up ordering a bottle of wine and two bruschetta platters for 3 people.  The white bean one was delicious! Definitely one of my favorites! The apple and Brie was on the sweeter side, the mozzarella and tomato was also good, on the simple side.  The bacon and tomato was a superb flavor and the prosciutto and fig was also good.  I think the one with pesto was also wonderful and may have been my second favorite! The bread was soft, wish it was a little crispier but it makes for easy eats cause it's not hard to bite into! They also cut each bruschetta into quarters so it's easy to share all the different ones! Great for a wine night and bites where you just want to hang out and chat! The atmosphere is also good.. Very dark and candlelit inside and there are misters on the outside to keep it semi cool!

Lovely lovely hotel in Paradise Valley. The views in this area of Camelback is spectacular! Once you drive into the resort, it looks and feel like you're in a desert oasis.  The units are very spread out so it might be difficult to locate where you're staying but the whole area is nice! Cactus and well landscaped surroundings makes it picturesque with Camelback in the background.    The rooms were a good size. We got two regular rooms and they were very cute! It was like a romantic lodge with the tall ceilings and wood beams! The beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean.  There is a bathroom with sink and another sink on the outside which made it nice! Would definitely recommend this place and come back!

I saw a line outside and we were in Old Town looking for a breakfast joint so why not?! We called several other places and the wait was over an hour. So we decided to just stop here.  There was definitely a 20-30 minute wait on a Sunday morning.. Which is fine considering the place had awesome reviews. However when we sat down, the inside wasn't packed at all. There were quite a few tables opened actually.. So not sure why they kept everyone outside waiting.  The service was good.. Our server was nice and friendly.  The restaurant was clean.  I ordered the pumpkin latte and it was delicious!  But that's all.. The food was mediocre.  The chorizo Mac and cheese was spicy.. Nothing special about the flavors. The noodles felt a little over cooked and too soft.  There wasn't a great cheesy combo or flavor.. It just tasted like a chili mixed with noodles.  I wanted to try two different things and the waitress recommended I order one side of each so I could try both.. Glad I did because boy the side was huge! I had the banana bread French toast.. Big slice of banana bread.. With banana and pecans on top.  It tastes like it looks.. Soft and dense. Banana bread.. Nothing special.  The crunchy pumpkin pancakes was the other thing I wanted to try.. Super big pancake! As big as a large plate.  Again it was flat.. Doughy.. Not light and fluffy like I expected.  I think I liked this better out of the two but they both didn't stand out to me.. I was disappointed in how high it was rated for what I ordered and tried.  Probably wouldn't come back here.

Great ambiance but a little loud. I couldn't hear what the people were saying just a person over to my left.. Conversation was hard.  The wait staff was friendly and the place was clean.  Very busy place in old town Scottsdale right in the middle of everything and not far from all the bars.  The original chopped salad was amazing!! I've never had anything like it! I would go back again just for the salad!  The short ribs were good and you can fork it off without a knife but I felt like it was a bit dry.  Flavored were good though.  The mash potato was sweet underneath.. Which I wasn't a fan of but I suppose it goes well with the short rib flavor and the coffee compote sauce.  The mint chocolate budino was a little too sweet for me and the mint taste wasn't apparently strong.  The cookie on top was frozen and really hard to break into to share.  The desserts here were not my favorite but a big win with that chopped salad.  The smoked salmon and pesto dressing made the flavors but the kale, sunflower seeds and some black fruit gave it a crunch!  I want it again already!  I liked the salad so much I went back the next day before my flight to get the chopped salad to go so I can eat it for dinner on my way home!!! Loved it and couldn't stop thinking about it!!

The first time I had an acai bowl was in Hawaii and they've become quite popular in other cities since then.. The health food industry has grown.  I love the concept of an acai bowl with fresh fruits, granola and whatever else you want to put on top, sweetened with honey.  I had the original acai bowl.. Medium size.  The portion was a good size for the price.  The acai mixture with blueberries and strawberries I believe, was a good flavor.  A little loose in consistency, I wish it was slightly thicker but the flavors were good.  The granola was fresh and crunchy and the fresh fruits were indeed fresh.  It was sweetened perfectly.  I would definitely come back for a nice healthy breakfast next time I'm in Phoenix.  The tropical bowl was also good.. Acai blended with mango and I believe pineapples!  Lots of different bowls to choose from and they come in 3 sizes! Questioning the health factor of the acai sorbet but it tastes good!

Very gorgeous (Moroccan inspired?) spa.  The facilities were large and very very nice.  We had a bachelorette party here an had a package with a 50 min service of our choice, a $15 food voucher (which was enough for a meal) and champagne.  They greeted us with bath bombs in the shape of cute little cupcakes for the bridal party!   They reserved us a table for lunch out in the pool deck but in the heat wave it definitely wasn't covered, had anything misters, or any shade.  We opted to use two small tables right in the entrance instead.  For such a nice spa I would think they'd invest in misters and some more umbrellas! The pool was also very small and lacked the fountain of adding new cold water, therefore the pool was way too hot to be refreshing.  And the pool wasn't necessarily the cleanest either - it had a ton of sand at the bottom and the service at the pool area was slow.    The service and facility for everything else was great! They had nice rooms for the messages and facials.  A nice social lounge area and a quiet area with tempurpedic beds for rest.  There was a cold bath, a hot tub (wish there was a cold tub), a sauna, a steam room, a gym, etc.  The decor and walkways were definitely really nice and unique.  My deep tissue massage was pretty amazing and the other girls loved their services as well.    I think if they worked on their pool area and some refreshing options for the summer heat, it'll be perfect.  The food options were also pretty healthy.. Not the most amazing food but it works.  And they're right on time for appointments - always a plus to be super punctual!
