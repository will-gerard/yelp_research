I'm writing this review after not going to this place for a while.  But I thought about this place today because I just had a third mechanic today tell me that the catalytic converter was a total hack job.  It was an after market converter and not put on well at all.  And it wasn't really cheap where it makes sense that it was a horrible job.  I'd pass on this place, I moved on a while ago.

I just signed up for Yelp, and even though it's been awhile since I've been to this place, my experience was so bad, I had to write a review.    The service at this place is horrible.  I don't expect someone to be over the top nice to me, but the lady was rude everytime I went in.  The last straw was when I checked out  a blouse and noticed that the buttons were ruined.  The lady didn't care and when I pushed she said I could call later and speak with the manager.  Seriously didn't care and clearly didn't want to do anything about my damaged blouse.  This was it, I was never going back.

This is place great!  Karen is the best.  Always great cut and color.  My hair is curly/wavy and she always used sheers and did a great job.
