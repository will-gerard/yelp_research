Don't look at the photos after ordering you won't want to eat it! Muscles were flavorless

Most ludicrous place I've ever ordered from. What normal human would start a sizing scale with "large" when in actuality it is the smallest size?!  I ordered a large pizza thinking I was getting a large pizza, waited an hour only to get a 14" pizza for 5 people... not to mention my garlic knots were burnt. I would rather eat 3$ Tony's pizza from food city.

This place is right around the corner from my house so I will walk here occasionally for some food and a beer. Everything about this place is disappointing! Everything I have ever had here has lacked in flavor or  has been stale and overcooked. Worse than the food is the service if you are not a regular you really don't exist to these servers, I asked for ketchup and she rolled her eyes and took her sweet time bringing it out.

Came for happy hour on a Thursday we ordered some beers and sat for an hour before anyone took our order. We had a quesadilla ... it was basically a microwaved tortilla with grease and a little cheese some cheap salsa and a couple chunks of chicken... not great! I probably won't come back.

I got a pizza delivered and the whole experience was mediocre. The crust and topping were...ok. I got a pepperoni,mushroom and ricotta pizza. It looked like the ricotta came out of a squeeze tube it was zigzagged in large trails across the pizza, it just seemed like a little more effort could have been applied and the crust was a bit dry and over cooked.

This place is hit or miss. I go here a lot, I like that you don't need to call ahead, they always get you in quickly and they do a damn good pedicure.  They aren't always the kindest but they do a fast, good job and inexpensive. Also it's pretty clean and they actually massage your legs not just rub lotion around.

The menu is great the gyros are huge and amazing best one in Arizona! The inside of the restaurant could use a good scrub and some fresh paint so I always have to get my orders to go but the sandwiches are worth it!

Great! Ive been a few times and have had burgers they were amazing cooked perfect the buns are really good lots of drinks options our service was great and I absolutely love the atmosphere but I have to say I'm usually a bit shocked when my bill comes... every side is separate and if there is more than a couple people it can really add up!

I had family in town and brought them to Orange Sky for dinner and we had an amazing experience. The food was excellent and the atmosphere was ideal for a relaxing evening to catch up. Our server Demetrio was so kind and insightful, he made our dining experience one to remember.

Love the atmosphere and the food is great! The sweet potato tots are really good. I went one time and the terrible service and when I mentioned something about it to the owner they immediately addressed it and bent over backwards to make sure my friends and I left happy!

Katy has been doing my extensions for over a year and I couldn't be happier to have found such a sweet stylist. It is a relaxing intimate salon with great conversation and quality service! The hair is so soft and looks so natural nobody believes it's extensions. The locks she uses are super small and comfortable I sometimes forget they're even there!

The best meal I have had in very long time the ambiance is so beautiful the lighting was perfect this is a great place for a dinner with girlfriends or a date night, I would even feel comfortable going alone and sitting at the bar. My mean was so good I haven't stopped thinking about it I have been suggesting it to everyone and would eat here every night if I could!!!! So in love

The atmosphere was nice, the inside, patio and bar area was fun but the prices were very high and the food was mediocre at best... they had a large beer selection but you can almost go anywhere for that.

This is my favorite place to go for food coffee and juice ! Everyone that works here is so wonderful and helpful. They will set you up with a custom juice cleanse to fit your wants and needs or you can pop in and grab a bottled juice for the day. They also have the most delicious treats like vegan cookies I stop by almost every morning for breakfast and I'll pick up lunch and couple juices!

I recently had my hair bolayaged by cole and had an amazing experience! I went in with almost black hair and  left with a gorgeous multi toned bolayage. My hair is not damaged or dry, the products she used smell amazing and my hair still feels super soft. Her salon has a great energy and she was extremely detail oriented and took care in keeping my hair in tact. I will definitely go back and I will recommend her to all my friends.

I have seen Charles several times for Botox and Juvederm, he is so professional and kind. I have recommended a lot of friends and will continue to recommend  him to anyone I can. Every time I know someone who has seen Charles they love their experience and the results were exactly what they wanted.

AMAZING the wine list is great! My friend and I shared the caprese salad and the salmon dish with fried avocados and at first I was nervous because the portions looked small but I left satisfied and very full. It was the perfect amount to share!

I had the most amazing experience here from the moment I walked in the door. It is easy to find the office is beautiful and extremely clean, I was welcomed by the staff right away and everyone was very friendly and inviting. I had some botox and juvederm done by Susan at first I was nervous and didn't want to it to be over done but she took the time to listen to what I wanted. I am totally obsessed with the outcome I could not be any happier my lips look freaking amazing, better than I even expected, she was gentle and did exactly what I asked!!!!!! I would never consider going anywhere else now and I'm excited to see what other services they offer and I'm going to rave to all my friends

Thank goodness the line moves quickly because the service is horrendous and unpleasant. The food is delicious and fresh though.
