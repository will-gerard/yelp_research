I grew up going to this DQ.  Still love all the flavors it has to offer.  However, they gone a little crazy with the 8, 150 Watt Energy-Efficient lightbulbs in the 10 square feet leading up to the cash registers.  I nearly had a seizure.  I LITERALLY put my hand above my eyes, making a mock visor, to shield my light-sensitive eyes from the intense glare!  The "cherry on top" if you will, was the adolescent employee who was all too moody about defending el sol when asked, "what's goin' on with the lights here"?  Seriously....how could she NOT NOTICE THE BRIGHTNESS OF THOSE LIGHTS?!?!?!?!  The cookie dough blizzard was excellent as always!  Minus the glare, it would have been a 5 star event  OH, one more thing.  No joking, we actually whipped out a camera and took a picture of us under the lights as it was all too funny to us!

What happened?!?!???!?!?!?!??!  Literally devastated when I drove from N. Scottsdale to S. Tempe to take out of town guests to my FAVORITE Italian Restaurant EVER!  What HAPPENED?!?!!?  I really want to know why they closed?  The thought of never having their Penne Vodka again, is really, really heartbreaking.  Bummer.  I hope their family is ok!  I had an appointment and it turned out to be a dissppointment!  (Gross understatement).  Still giving it a 5-star rating...cause I know that's how good it would have been!

My family has catered from Carolina's before and LOVED the food.  I am hosting a party in the near future and wanted to cater from there.  I called to speak with someone about catering and was on hold for over 5 minutes.  I hung up, went on the website and was going to research it there.  I was unable to print their catering menu due to the way they have it uploaded on the web.  So I called back to talk to someone about catering.  After being on hold another FIVE MINUTES, Thelma came on the line and I asked her to fax me a catering menu...she asked me to hold so she could get a catering manager on the phone. I told her I had already lost 10 minutes of my life to holding for that already, gave her my number and asked her to fax me the catering menu.  A moot point, because if it takes 10 minutes to get someone on the line, how good is the catering service going to be?  I'll be getting my catering from another company :(

Great experience with Adam at TintAZ.  Adam added tint to my car about 2 years ago and I love the work he did.  Additionally, there was a small problem with the tint that developed over time and upon calling Adam he was extremely receptive to setting up an appointment to come by and repair the problem. He fixed the window and it did not cost me a penny as he guarantees his tinting product.  I offered Adam a small tip for his time and also to show him my appreciation for repairing the tint at no cost and he refused to take the tip.  I'm about to get a new car and without a doubt, he is who I will hire for my tint needs. Five star review!

My family, friends and I were recently at Teres to kick off the beginning of my sister's wedding festivities.  We booked the appointments far in advance knowing we wanted a "fun" experience all together the day before the wedding.  I don't write many Yelp reviews, but after the experience we all had, felt compelled to share the experience.  The appointments for the 10 of us were made weeks in advance.  Upon getting there they took one girl back.  After she was done, they took the 2nd girl back.  Then about another half an hour later, they started to take the remainder of us.  Some of us waited 90 minutes before our appointment started with the intention of us all getting our nails done together.  But with a large group, this could be forgiven.  However, the girl up front had such an attitude.  We had a lot on our plates for the day before the wedding and the girl was totally offended when we were individually asking what time our appointments would start.  And, other employees were coming up and openly consoling her like she was dealing with a nightmare.  We were not being difficult customers.  The services and those who provided the services also failed to impress as well.  My mother was a nail technician for 15 years, so I can appreciate someone who has been in the business for a long time.  Every single one of the ladies who provided the services had some sort of an attitude or chip on their shoulder.  Some better than others, but overall, none of them seemed happy to be providing the service that is in fact their job. I would say they were actually rude.  And, the icing on the cake - the services sucked.  For those of us who had gel manicures, our cuticles were flooded with product.  My cuticles were not trimmed, nor pushed back.  Only 4 days after the services, my gel polish is lifting - supposed to last for 2 weeks.  I will say the polish on my toes looks GREAT.  However, pedicure itself not so great.  No cuticles trimmed, massage lasted less than 2 minutes.  Callous scrubbing wouldn't have removed peeling, sunburned skin.  Simply poor.  It cost me $83 for a basic manicure and pedicure - pretty expensive considering how bad the services were.  And the best part, at the end of the day when we went to pay, they would not honor the member pricing.  My sister had negotiated the member pricing up front cause there were so many of us coming.  There were supposed to be 10 of us.  One person couldn't make it last minute, and because there were only 9, they wouldn't honor the member pricing.  This was a bit surprising considering most of us has more than one service (both manicure and pedicure).  Final summary - cute place, everything else not so great.  I'll never go back and I'd never recommend it to anyone.

Simply as good as it gets.  Wonderful tacos Hawaii-style!  Fish is fresh and tasty. When I went in for the first time, I was back two additional times within a week.  So good!  Friendly, hard working staff, place is clean and packed to the gills (pun intended) every time I have been.  Hands down, a 5 star rating in my book.  So happy this place is close to where I live. Highly recommended!
