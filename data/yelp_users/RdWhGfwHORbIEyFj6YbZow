We reserved the back room for a dinner and it couldn't have been nicer. They allowed us to pace out our meal as we liked. Food is just great here.

I really enjoy their bruchetta. Their brunch is really good and the mimosas are tasty.

I was lucky enough to have Flowers By Jodi put together the floral for my wedding last weekend. She did an amazing job. Jodi is a character, just hilarious. She heard exactly what I want, and nailed it. Her prices were fair as well.

This place is consistently wonderful. We had our rehearsal dinner here and it was incredibly well run.

Delicious. Great service. Cute atmosphere. We brought out of town guests and they fell in love with the prickly pear margaritas.

Fuego Bistro is hands down one of the best restaurants in Arizona. I was incredibly lucky to have them cater my wedding this past weekend. I had all of my guests coming up to me raving that it was not only the best wedding food they had ever had, but some of the best food they had ever had.   Jeff Ward creates an amazing experience for all of his guests. His attention to detail, and the care he puts into everything he does is evident. Kevin, also makes an incredible effort.   If you haven't gone, you are missing out. The Coke Cola braised short ribs are a MUST.

The machines are really old and about a quarter of the ones up stairs were out of service. It looks like they are shutting down for a day in July- so hopefully the renovations include new equipment.

Was looking forward to try this for awhile. Our server was nice and location was good as well. The risotto was delicious. The pork tenderloin was just ok. We ordered the sundae and received it missing the necessary parts to warrant a $9 dessert- no macerated berries and no whip cream. Made the server aware and surprisingly nothing was done. Something minor but leaves a bad finish.

Really enjoy the pizza here. The little patio is cute too. The wine pours are very generous. You don't' really feel like you're on Mill.

Good service. Mediocre food, even at happy hour prices. Honey chicken wings the best of the HH menu.

I really enjoy this place. Really love the space. I'm not a fried chicken and waffle fan typically- but you have to get it here. The waffles are to die for.

Came bowling with my family here and it was everything we wanted it to be. We live downtown and often end up at Lucky Strike, but have become totally offended by their pricing and their lanes just aren't good. This place was awesome. Service great, great lanes, nice beer prices. Will definitely be back.

I will definitely be back. Our service was off- appetizer ordered didn't make it in, as well as one of the entrees. Someone came over and offered to take the appetizer off the bill which we thought was very nice. However, when we received the bill it was still on it. Not the best.   Everything we had was delicious though. There was a dessert that we had heard about that wasn't on the menu that night. They were nice enough to whip one up for us which was appreciated. A neat spot- could have been a 5 star experience if the service wasn't so off.

Heather did my wedding this past weekend. She was amazing. She is an incredibly nice person, and just nailed exactly what we were looking for. We all wanted to look natural, but obviously made up for the wedding. She listened to everyone's desires, and we all walked away feeling like a million bucks. I would recommend her to anybody.

One of my favorite experiences I have had in Phoenix. Food was great and the drinks were very special too. We were sadly not in love with our pasta course, but everything else was great. Will definitely go back to check out the brunch.

We came here before a Diamondbacks game for appetizers and drinks. It was great to see how many people were there before the game. It's nice that downtown is getting more action than just coming in and out for the game.   We really enjoyed our food. Our server was very sweet. Look forward to going back

We had a nice meal here for a Sunday night. Would be interesting to come back when it's more of a "club". The pesto edamame was different and good.

Had a very mediocre experience here. I was really excited to try due to it's proximity to my parent's house. I was thinking it would be a good place for us to frequent. The food was nothing special, my order was wrong, and the service sporadic. Won't be back.

I really enjoy this place. Great view of the city. Really enjoy the beer and food selection. My only complaint was that the last time they were there it just wasn't properly staffed. It was a beautiful day (and perhaps it's having lived in Chicago for 9 years and suffering through cold where when it got nice EVERYONE was outside), but if I had a restaurant I would assume everyone would be out and on my patio. The servers were working extremely hard, but there just weren't enough of them.

My Mom and I, hit up this place for a girls lunch. We loved the atmosphere. We sat on the patio and the traffic from Cactus was not an issue at all. We split the prime rib sandwich and the Caesar salad. Both were very good. Service was spot on as well. We will definitely be back.

My first time at Otro I was not wowed. It was very solid but nothing special. I wishing I was just at Gallo. The second time we went for lunch and everyone at the table was raving.

We had a fun date night here. Cool space good atmosphere. A bit on the loud side. Our drinks were tasty and we really enjoyed the tacos. Our dessert was not special, and this is coming from a girl who will eat anything dessert wise. I would skip next time.

Really happy this has come to downtown phoenix. It's nice to have a place where you can bike ride to that has such a great atmosphere. It's also dangerous in that you sit down for lunch and next thing you know the sun is setting. It's just too hard to leave the patio. I've enjoyed everything I've had to eat. I also appreciate the events they are putting on.

From the time you walk in you know you're going to have a good time. I'm thinking it was the owner immediately came up and greeted us and was joking around. I really enjoyed what was almost like a deconstructed spicy tuna roll. Really happy this place exists downtown.  If you're driving parking can be a bit of a pain.

We are so happy this place is in our neighborhood. We recommend cozying up at the bar. The bartenders are always welcoming and you have the TVS if you want to watch the game. So happy they have a lot of their beer on tap now.

I love this concept. When I am out I typically default to my favorite wines- this gives me the opportunity to try wines I might not typically get to enjoy. The room and patio are decorated well- you feel like you can settle in with a group of friends in a welcoming atmosphere.   I also appreciate what they are doing with their beer selection. They have good options and appreciate the nods to AZ beers. This is a nice option for those in your group who might not be a wine drinker.

Finally had a chance to come here. First off the bartenders are AMAZING. So helpful and thoughtful in their suggestions. In our party we had the chance to try 6 different cocktails and each one was on point. We will definitely be back for the cocktails. The food was very nice, but I just get tired of fried food at a point and they didn't really have a good counterbalance for it in my opinion on the menu. I will definitely be back for the drinks though and the hoe cakes with the spread.
