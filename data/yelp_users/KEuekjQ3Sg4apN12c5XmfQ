The best place I have been with all of my roommates. Definitely as good as they say! This is such a perfect, unique place.

Honestly not worth the price. The fpod we purchased was worse then a microwaved meal, also the seating is just like an office chair, no matter where you sit. Not worth the ticket price. Also, every single one of the employees were extremely rude and no one seemed happy to be there. Overall, i will never go back there.

When it comes to their donuts, I'm in love!! However, I tried their Thai Tea Boba, and I wouldn't get it again. But, Ill be back for their fluffy and delicious donut holes! The only thing thats is frusterating about the place is theres one girl that seems to be working very hard and is very nice, but the other people who were working with her seemed to have no sense of urgency when the line was continuously out the door, they were standing around or on the phone. I give props to the girl at the front counter who is working her but off!
