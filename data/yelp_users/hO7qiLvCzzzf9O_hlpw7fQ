Fries were over salted the last 3 times. Very disappointing for me because I generally love Wendy's.  If you can avoid the fries odds are the are extremely salty.

The Food, Service and Overall Experience was Delightful. The only criticism I would have is they didn't offer low sodium soy sauce. I'm looking forward to my next visit here.

Ya know I received a coupon in the mail for this place, so I decided to try it. After we ate a not so good breakfast; they declined my coupon. Overall food was not that good. Customer service was even worse.

We played 11 holes this morning and the front nine was in rough shape. We waited at every shot on the back nine and it took about 45 minutes to finish two holes. It was so bad the course employee that played with us left and said it was way too slow!! Typically, the front desk will offer some sort of voucher or discount for feature use. When we asked the guy at the front he started yelling at us. As a business owner I can say this is the WORST management team I have ever seen! I will contact the ownership directly and notify them of my poor experience!  Stay far away from this place!!!!

I am have been here two times in 2 days. Yes,  the food is that good. You may ask yourself why only 1 star then? The service here has been sub par on both occasions. My last vist was a togo order. The lady told me it would be ready in 20 minutes. It took them 45 minutes. So I waited on a chair outside in the cold. DONT EVER ORDER FOOD TOGO!

Cafe Rio is fantastic. The one star review is based solely on the terrible coustomer service at this location. It seems like there's no manager on duty. The lady running the register was sitting down talking to other employees. After a few minutes of just standing there I said excuse me can I pay for my meal? The girl seemed very irritated that she had to come help me. I almost walked out and left the food. I will not be going back here.

Exellent service, attention to detail and good conversation. What else do you need from a great barber? I drive all the way across town to come here and it's well worth the trek!

This place has fantastic burger options that are far more unique and authentic than a typical burger joint. The server recommend parmesan fries and a side of queso dip. That really hit the spot and I would strongly recommend the same. The best part of Hopdoddy is they source all ingredients locally all the way down to Papago beer options on draft. I'm excited about our next visit to Hopdoddy.
