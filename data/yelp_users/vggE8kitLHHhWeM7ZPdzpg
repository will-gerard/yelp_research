If you ever overhear someone saying Grand Ave is dirty (as I have, probably from developers waiting in line with a bulldozer and starbucks contract) , this place is one of many to prove them wrong.  The food is good, great selection....lots of vegetarian options.  Good drinks, possibly best chai I have ever had.  the side potato salad is very tasty.  Not a huge fan of the egg-whiches.  the croissant is a little too hard.  Atmosphere:   Nice patio;  little garden and a bunch of colorful artist bungalows.  sweeps in the zen like relaxation for a lazy sunday or friday lunch.

As a new yelper, I feel the need to span the star spectrum, but I really had a hard time trying to think of a 1.  Then I remembered a little voyage I took last fall, coupon in hand, to Zoe's, which is right between my apartment and work.  The coupon gave me pretty much any menu item with a drink purchase.  Thank God I had that coupon, becuase I would have been pissed if I had actually payed $7.50 for a "spinach quesadilla" which was cream cheese and cooked spinach between two tortillas.  I could have made it better for $.45 at home.   Then I actually went back again to give it a second chance (I had a lot of coupons) and ate a very boring sandwich with cafeteria stlye mashed potatoes.   Maybe this place would be better for non vegetarians....my coworker liked his Greek Chicken plate, (liked, not loved)....it may go up to 2 or 3 stars for carnivores.

I agree with all these posts.  cheap, colorful, huge menu, good horchata, tres leches cake at the panaderia....  Not much more has to be emphasized, however, one reccommendation: get the ELOTE along with whatever you decide to get.  Its corn on a stick covered in mayo and queso- delicioso.  if you really want a treat, squirt ketchup all over it too.  mmmm market foooood

mmmmm  I love this place.  When I didnt have a tv this was always a destination for some good tube watching/ beer drinking/ thai eating.  It isn't too loud, like some other trendy thai places that play music and have their air conditioning too high.  Also it is authentic, also unlike some trendy places (pf changs/ pei wei etc).  The diner style stmosphere is charming, and you can sit at the bar if youd like.  They also have a huge room, which I have never actually seen used.  I guess one could conceivably hold a large gathering here.    The portions are enourmous, and there are a ton of options.  For some reason, I cant break away from my favorite, vegetarian delight.  the sauce is so good, i always ask for extra.     You will likley leave full.  only downside here is that the lunch isn't as good, way less options, but pretty fast.

If you are a vegetarian, or like interesting food, avoid this place at all costs.  You may be tempted to meet someone for lunch--  business purposes.  dont do it.  find another place downtown.   Its not worth the loss of $10.  when I went...the service was  slow, the atmosphere was stiffingly stuffy, and my salad was basically iceberg and some fruit.

This charming little cafe made my day-  the atmosphere is charming, clean, bright and warm....and the wait staff and cook were friendly and welcoming.... but the food?  the food was the best part.  eclectic, delicious AND reasonably priced.  I got an eggplant panini--called espaniclata or something- which came with a side salad.  The quesadilla I split with my coworker was surprising and sweet- good for a snack or dessert.  I wasn't a big fan of the chai (I stole a sip from a friend)---it was Indian, just not what I am used to- not as sweet Anyways, I went on Friday for lunch, and liked it so much I had to go back Sunday.  Again, fantastic.  I think I found a new love.
