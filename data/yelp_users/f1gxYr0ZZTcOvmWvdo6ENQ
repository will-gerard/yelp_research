I am really sad. I went here to get a birthday cake for my babys first birthday. I am so excited planning this event, and I know that not everyone can be as excited as me, but Barbs totally deflated me. Maybe I had too high of expectations? I went there and told them I wanted to order a cake. I had a few cake designs from pinterest on my phone. The man behind the counter did not seem to even want to deal with me, he kept talking to the people coming into the store. All he said was "can you just email me a picture?" I then said "oh, ok, can you give me a card with the address on it?" He totally ignored me and started helping another customer. I got his attention and said I would like to try a cupcake to help choose a flavor and what would he recommend. He said the red velvet was popular, but did not really seem to care to keep helping me. It was sad. I guess I expected them to be wanting to give me design ideas and flavor ideas, maybe show me some pictures, or give me an idea of cost. Basically he just wanted me out of the store. I drove 30 minutes to go there because of the reviews, and left the store in 3 minutes with a red velvet cupcake and no cake ordered. They got an extra star because the cupcakes were very good, and the price was good. Will I be back? Probably not, I need some enthusiasm with my deserts.

This is a great place to get bagels or breakfast sandwiches or even regular sandwiches. The bagels are fresh and tasty.   We love walking here on a Saturday morning and sitting outside. Its nice to have a restaurant that you can walk too even though its a little far.  I really love to get the dozen bagels with schmear to bring to events. I love how the bagel box has a place to carry the schmear. Its cute and clever.  I love their pumpkin bagel in the fall. When I was pregnant, all I wanted was pumpkin and this with their honey nut cream cheese was divine! Oh I wish it was fall.

I love the ice and an ocean water!  Its your typical sonic. Good food and drinks. The people who work there are polite and hurry to get you your stuff. If I am thirsty, I like to stop here and get a diet ocean water. Hubby likes to get coke with cherries. You can also buy their ice if you are having a party. Not much else to report here. Check it out!

I have 2 hypoallergenic dogs who have so many allergies. It is so ironic! Anyways this is where I usually get my dog food. They have a great selection and I can find no chicken, no grain dog food like taste of the wild for my allergy dogs. If you don't see what you like, make sure you go in the back where they keep the big bags of dog food and other brands. I also like to get them frozen bones to chew on. They go nuts over these bones and will spend all day in the yard eating them. I will not let them in the house though because they get all gooey. I think the prices are pretty reasonable. I have not found the dog food any cheaper in the area. I think the cat department is lacking though. They do not have a big selection and I could not find any food for sensitive stomach cats. (Geez, my animals are so weird or maybe I am just neurotic?) They also do not have any cat toys for me to buy! This makes shopping difficult because I have to go to 2 different stores if I need cat stuff. Luckily she eats a lot less, so her food lasts so much longer.  I also like to get my horse stuff here. They have lots of treats and supplies. It is mostly geared for the western type rider. You can get your dog groomed here. They tried but didnt get the cut right so we haven't been back.  If you are feeling blue, go look at the cute little chicks! Adorable. It makes me want to get chickens because they are so cute. Then I think about chicken poop, and I am like no, no more animals.   Also check out the farmers market they have on the weekends. Support your local farmers and businesses! Its important. My cupcake lady (cupcake cafe) is there sometimes. Its great!

I am so happy that Dr Sawyer was recommended to me. Both my husband and I found him top notch.   He is very kind and has a great bedside manner. He spends time and gets to know his patients over the course of their pregnancy. He will also tell you his opinion and give you the facts and his recommendations and has the knowledge to back them up.   His office staff is pretty good. Sometimes they were not always the friendliest to me. I know we all have bad days, so I am just going to let it slide since Dr Sawyer is great.   He was a great doctor when I was in labor. He kept good tabs on my progress. I had to have a c section and everyone was impressed the he used dermabond instead of staples.   So don't hesitate- he is the best doctor!

Oh man, I have had mixed experiences here. I went last Friday with my sister in law and it was not good. I have gone other times though, and it was fine. So last Friday was a 1 star experience, but the other times have been 4. So average about 2.5  Here is what I like- It is a nice big and clean place. The tubs all have disposable liners which make me feel beter. Also, It is close by. I also like how they set a timer and give you a long massage. I love how you get your legs cleansed with oranges. It leaves a nice tingly feeling on your leg. They also do a good job of removing dead skin and calluses off your feet. I have also never had to wait long.   What went wrong- Every time, I get a #2 pedicure, which includes a longer massage, callus treatment and other extras. My sister in law got a #1 which is just the basics. Well, mine was finished like 10 minutes before hers even though I was supposed to get extra. My lady set the timer for 15 minutes, and later i saw that my massage was supposed to be 20 minutes. Besides the callus treatment, I did not see any difference for paying 13 dollars more. This made me really mad.  They were also rude to my sister in law. They cut her and kept trying to make excuses that she had a hang nail. The man painting her nails was also very rude to her. He made comments about how much glitter she wanted and did not listen to her when she was explaining how she wanted them painted. It left a really sour taste in my mouth. I really feel like its too expensive there compared to other places, so I will keep searching for another place.

This mall is ok.  It is close to my house, so it is where I shop most of the time. It has some nice stores like Macy's and Dillard's. both those stores need a remodel though, they are starting to show their age. What I really hate it walking on the ground floor. Every little kiosk is trying to get your attention and bothering you while you walk. It feels like Tijuana there. I hate it and it makes me want to leave the mall quickly.   There are some good food court places like chipotle and paradise. You can also eat at Chevys and have a nice margarita.   It is a pretty crowded mall especially on the weekend.   Overall this mall is ok, it has what I need but isn't the greatest shopping experience.

Please arrowhead mall stop filling up the bottom floor like its Tijuana. I hate going to this mall now because every few feet I have people yelling at me trying to get my attention to buy their goods at their kiosk. I have 4 hair straighteners already! I do not need you to straighten my hair. No I don't want your diamond makeup! I am not interested in a time share or phone case. Please leave me alone! My whole shopping experience is ruined and I would rather just go to Amazon.

We went here last night for my mothers birthday. We went at 5 and were seated right away. As it was in Surprise, I was shocked that we were seated so promptly because it was prime dining time. They also were able to set up for the 2 kids, so that was nice. Everything seemed to start out fine. The service was good and our server was pleasant and able to get the food to the kiddos fast.  I just wish the food was better. This was one of the worst meals I have had in a long time. First off, my mom and I ordered margaritas. We should have just ordered lime juice. There was no alcohol in it. My mom even ordered a double and could not taste it. Since I had the baby, I rarely drink and am a cheap date after 1 drink. Even after ordering 2 margaritas, I felt no buzz. It was sad for my one night with cocktails in a long time.  My husband and my mom both ordered steak and lobster. The lobster was so chewy and tasteless. The meat was grizzly and had no flavor or the promised rub. I had mahi mahi and it was so rubbery and flavorless. The toppings on it added nothing.  It was so disappointing. We have not been to an outback in many years. I am not sure if the quality has gone downhill in the overall chain or just this location but I will not be back for such mediocre food.

We contacted Arizona rainfall in 2011 because they were going to do my parents home and met with a rep. He came out to our house and had many ideas. We were really excited. This was our first house, and the landscaping needed serious help. He said he would get back to us in a few days with an estimate. We waited a few days, and heard nothing. We called him and he said he was working on it. We exchanged a few emails, and he was still working on it. Finally, he just stopped responding to us.  My parents were the ones who recommended him. He created a beautiful plan for them, but he stopped calling them too at the same time. They were all set to go with Arizona Rainfall and ended up having their yard be delayed because he bonked them as well.   So, I cannot comment on the work they do, but their customer service is terrible. If he did not want to do our yard, we would have understood. It was a big project, but at least give us the courtesy and left us know that they just aren't that into us and wanted to see other people.

Thank goodness Sweet Tomatoes is back. I have missed you! I hated driving down to the Phoenix location to get my fix. I was back here the day it re-opened. There are still remnants of the Field kitchen, but thats ok, as long as most of my Sweet Tomatoes is back. They kept the beer and wine so that should make my dad happy!  I don't really have much to add except that it was just like I remembered. The coupons are back so I can feed me, my husband, and baby for less than 20 and give them healthy options. There are not a lot of places like that in Arrowhead. So I am very happy.

This place is really great. Everyone I have taken here loves it. It is always crowded, so you know it is good.  My mom and I really like the falafel. I havent had a falafel that good anywhere else. It is perfectly fried and has a lot of flavor in it. Sometimes I get it in a pita, or on top of a greek salad. It is really good.  I also love the hummus and pita bread appetizer. Another good app is the taziki and pita.  The baby loves to eat all of those.  My husband always gets the schwarma (sp?) wrap and says it is great. You can get it with a meal deal that includes salad or fries and a drink. The fries are fresh cooked and delicious. His only complaint is he can't get it spicy enough.  Even my in laws who do not like most foods like this place, so you know its good!

I highly recommend specialized flooring. We went to several stores around Phoenix including Costco and their prices did not compare. Also the other stores could not get the carpet in for 4 to 6 weeks. Specialized flooring installed my carpet within 10 days. They worked all day to get it installed. It looks and feels beautiful. Please check them out.

Please stay this way. I live by Arrowhead and have to drive to this location now. I love Sweet Tomatoes. I always bring a coupon, and we eat for a reasonable price. I am able to get a variety of foods that my baby and I can try.  Its great. It doesn't need to change to a Field Kitchen.   I love the salad bar and all the premade salads. My baby loves the mac and cheese. She will cut you for it! She is that crazy about it. I am not a terrible mom, though, and only giving her mac and cheese, she gets salad and different veggies, she eats all the soups, and tons of fruits. Mac and cheese is her little bonus.   Ugh the only thing is that I eat waaay too much here. I have to learn some self control. I am not trying to fill up on the delicious salads. They are so good.   Anyways, check them out. Its fast, fun, and kids love it.

We went here for family Sunday Brunch with the parents. The parking lot was full and we thought we were going to have to wait to be seated. So we sent Dad to forge ahead as we parked the car. We cruised on in, and low and behold my Dad was at a table directing us to our table. I was shocked that we got seated right away, but the restaurant is big inside. So if the parking lot looks crowded, still check it out, you might be surprised. So we got all settled in and browsed the menu. There were so many things on the menu that I wanted. It was great! As a semi-vegetarian, there were tons of choices. There was also a healthy food section that I was drawn to.  My mom and I both decided to order the same thing- the tri athlete omelet. My dad got the Acapulca express omelet and husband got the bacado. We were all set to order but waited 15 minutes before anyone came to our table, even to get our drinks. That was a little irritating, but it was busy so we went with it. Finally the waitress arrived and we ordered. She apologized for the wait.  We waited a little longer than normal for food to arrive but when we did, we were happy. The food was really good. I loved my healthy omelet. I thought I would miss the cheese, but when I covered it in salsa I was like "cheese who?" I devoured it and it was delicious. I even put it on the english muffin and had a nice breakfast sandwich. Everyone else cleaned their plates too.   would we go back? Yes we would. It was tasty and there are still many more things I want to try and I wouldnt feel too guilty about.  So check it out and dine happy!

I was so excited to take my mom here for her birthday last year. I bought a groupon months in advance. Problems first started when I tried to make a reservation. The lady did not seem to know exactly what a good time to come and was not very professional. We finally found a time in the early afternoon.  When I got there it was very busy and it took a while to get acknowledged. There were a few open tables that still had food sitting on them. We were told to wait outside and someone would show us to our table.  We waited and waited outside. I was pregnant at the time and started to feel sick from being hungry and waiting outside. I went in to check. I had to wait about 5 minutes before anyone even came by. The tables were still dirty and the same people were waiting for food. We were told to wait outside some more. We waited for about 50 mins past our reservation before we were even seated.  Then we continued to wait some more. By this time I was feeling really sick and needed something in my stomach. Our waitress finally came. She was a young girl and it was her second day. She told us how 3 waitresses did not come but the owner kept sitting walkins so that is why we waited so long. She took our order for tea and what menu we were getting. We sat for another 30 mins without any service, not even tea. Our groupon came with soup so I flagged the waitress asking for our soup while we were waiting for our sandwiches and tea so I wouldn't throw up. She said she would get it right away. It never came. Finally the sandwiches and tea arrived and I didn't throw up, so it was a miracle.  This place would have gotten 1 star but the sandwiches and food was really good. The service and management is just terrible. The owner has no business sense  You would be better off to go to your niece or daughters tea room and have a pretend tea than go here.

This place is super tasty. We have only ordered delivery so I can't comment on the actual restaurant. The delivery is super fast usually. Also the price can't be beat. It has become a go to on our rotation. We love the orange chicken and the mu shu veggies. Also the fried rice is amazing. We always get white rice to for free which adds to the value. I do not recommend the crab puffs though, it was just friend dough no cream cheese or crab in it.

I had a great meal here. It was exactly as I expected. Hole in the wall good food. Those are my favorite places. It wasn't dirty but it wasn't spotless, it was hole in the wall clean.  I loved how I got to sample everything. So many different tastes to try.  I loved the food. And I loved the cookie. My meal was perfect. I got the chicken that all the reviews rave about. It is like orange chicken with less sweet orange taste and more savory. Soo good. My husband enjoyed his chicken dish  with cilantro but he was wishing he had mine. I gave him a piece but that was all he was getting from me.    It was packed on a Sunday night with a diverse crowd with the desire for good food as the common ground.   Highly recommend!

I love going to this place. It has a great atmosphere. I always try to sit by the duck pond. My baby, as well as my tablemates, love to watch the ducks and turtles. There is always some drama with the goose and mallards. Its great. It is like watching the discovery channel.  I give the atmosphere 5 stars.   The food is good. Is it the greatest Mexican? No it isn't. The food is probably a 3. It is good Mexican and I enjoy it. The chips and salsa are good because you get 3 different salsas. I have had the salad fresca with shrimp and it was good. I did not think the shrimp was worth it, and would probably just get it plain next time.   If you are in Cave Creek, you should go here or take out of town guests. There is no atmosphere like it. Plus afterwards you can check out the shops across the street.

This store  has everything you need to be crafty. Sometimes it is hard to find what you are looking for or someone to help you find it. When you do find someone to help you though, they are great. The staff is knowledgable and friendly, there just needs to be more of them!

Spring training! This is a fun time to take the family on the weekend. It is very nice with ample parking. There are people who drive around and can drop you off. It was a really fun experience and I can't wait for spring training next year.

Oh I love this movie theater so much. I just wish it was closer to my house. Whenever I have guests come from out of town, I take them here. I do not tell them why we are driving 45 minutes, and look at their faces when we get to the theater. They are always awestruck! I have always had wonderful experiences here. Its fabulous. You need to check out the 21+ suites at least once in your life. It will ruin regular movie theaters though! Once you have this luxury, you cannot go back easily.  I love being able to have a drink beforehand. it can be pretty expensive but it is all about the experience. Having a few cocktails before and during the movie just make it more fun.  I always order food. It is not the best food around, but again it is about the experience. I love reclining like a queen, and having them serve me food and drink with just a push of a button. I had the thai bang shrimp tacos, I dont recommend them, they were a little chewy. Their pizzettas are really good though. I also like the queso blanco dip, but it can be a little small if you are sharing. My dad said the prime rib sandwich was very tasty.  Make sure you make a reservation in advance using fandango so you can pick out your seats. The cinema suites can get packed fast, especially if it is a big movie.   This would have been 5 stars, but they took some of the perks away and it made me sad. If I never had the perks before, I would not have known, but I feel a little jipped every time I leave with out my hand towel, mint, and free sample popcorn. Please give me back my perks!

We get lunch here every week at work. It is pretty good. I had it before at another location and did not care for it at all. I really like it here. I usually get a yakisoba bowl with white chicken extra spicy. It is super tasty.   They are always nice when I call and place a large order. I just wish they didn't charge for extra sauce or extra spicy! But overall a good place.

I have never bought anything here, but have walked through many times. This is the dirtiest store. All the carpets are stained and have holes. Nothing has been dusted. I have been to some nice forever 21 stores and this place needs some help. I hope the general manager reads this and can help it look better!

I have waited a long time to put a review for this place out. It is not a subject a lot of people talk about and it isnt easy to talk about especially letting the world know about your personal problems. But here it goes...  I cannot give this place less than 5 stars. If it wasn't for Dr Zoneriach and his staff, I would not have this beautiful baby. I thank him every day. I have no words that can express my gratitude. I think he is the best fertility doctor in the valley.  His office is located in Scottsdale. It is very easy to call and make an appointment. The first one may be booked out a few weeks, but be patient. They are very organized and get your labs and diagnostic tests done efficiently. You meet with the Dr for about 30 minutes and go over your history. He then makes a plan for you and tells you what you need to.   It is stressful being in the situation where you need to go to this type of Doctors office, and they make the process a little less stressful for you. If you need this type of service, please check him out. Even if you do not choose him, make sure you check fertility rates online and compare the doctors. I did not know about these statistics and spent waay more money than I needed to.

Make sure to print out a 20% off coupon!  I checked in here because my husband had to make his weekly trip there to get tools, and now yelp is telling me to leave a review. I am not really a harbor freight shopper, but he loves it. He loves all the tools he can get and always prints out a 20% coupon. I am giving this place a good rating because he likes it and doesn't spend too much money there.

We were very impressed with Dr Van Sluyters and his office. After using revolving Army dentists for the past 6 years, it is nice to be able to see the same staff.  The whole office staff was very friendly. Dr Van Sluyter was also very knowledgeable and personable. They are also able to schedule you within a reasonable amount of time. My husband was happy that they open at 7 am so he is still able to get to work on time.

I had a good experience here. I went here for a goodbye happy hour party for a friend. We ended up there on a Wednesday and ordered a ton of apps and drinks.  The drinks were ok, they had a nice flavor, but I did not get the buzz I was looking for, so I just drank the happy hour wine.   The food was really good though. On Wednesday they have this cheese tray for 5 dollars. It was amazing. You have to get it.  The rest of the appetizers were delicious as well. I had these risotto balls. They were so good, I am still thinking about them. Everyone seemed to have a really good time.  Its not very baby friendly so I probably won't be back again since she is my foodie and we love to explore new places. If I had a sitter though and was invited, I would def be back.

Oh yum I love Jasons deli. Give me that salad bar. I go nuts for the salad bar and I don't even know why! Maybes its the tiny corn muffins, or just the mix. Its nice that I can go back again (hint Field Kitchen). I always get a nice sample for me and for the baby to try. Sometimes if I am in the mood I will order some soup too but its usually just the salad bar. I really like the option that I can jump the line and pay at the salad bar and soup line. It saves time during a busy lunch rush. I feel like a VIP when I do that. Also, everyone gets free soft serve. Its pretty good. The people are always friendly and clean up the tables really fast. I love this place and will return a lot for lunch.

I really like Pholicious. It is not my favorite pho in the valley, but it is my favorite close to me where I can get take out from. We usually get it 1-2xs a week. The price is right and the people are always friendly. If you are in the area, I would give it a shot.

Delicious! I cannot wait to go back here.  I was a little hesitant going because I do not eat steaks or much meat all together. We also were bringing the baby and I was worried she wouldn't be welcome. It was not that way at all though. The staff was super friendly and didn't care that she spilled food all over the place. The service all together was excellent. The food was amazing. I ordered the salmon. I usually do not like salmon I get in restaurants because it can lack flavor or be dry. This was the best salmon I have had. My husband ordered the filet. For 7 years he has been comparing all his steaks against a steak we had in San Luis Obispo, arrowhead grill has now taken top honor. He said it was the best steak of his life. That is a major accomplishment. The sides were all amazing. We got the trio of fries. I highly recommend them. I love fries with dipping sauce. The Mac and cheese was loved by the baby.  Oh the bread basket is fantastic too. So many different choices! The drinks were strong and tasty. Overall and amazing experience and I can't wait to go back. I just need a special occasions since it is expensive. Maybe a groupon will pop up?

This is where I like to go to get my plants. Sure you can go to Home Depot or lowes and the plants might be a little cheaper. But here I can find very nice plants, that have been well taken care of. The staff is also very knowledgeable and will spend as much time as you need answering questions and giving you advice. That is what makes it my top choice. I can never find anyone to ask questions to at the big box stores and if I do, they really don't know much.  I also like the plant selection here. They have a great variety and plants I have never seen before.   Please check them out for your gardening needs. Support your local business!

This is a great tranquil place. They have a strong focus on fertility and I am so lucky to be able to take advantage of their services. Dana is very knowledgeable at acupuncture and Chinese medicine.  Audrey gives great massages, and its one of the few in the Phoenix area to be certified in Mayan abdominal.   I am so thankful it is here. It is a great primary or adjunct treatment for infertility. I only wish they still had their ivf packages because they were a good deal.

I have been here several times with my parents. I want to like it so bad. It is close to them, and has so much potential. The views and setting are beautiful. The facility is nice and clean. I keep trying it but still get the same results.  I think my biggest problem is the menu. I am not sure they know quite what they are going for. Are they catering for the tastes of the local trilogy patrons? Kind of, but then they try to fancy it up and make it super gourmet but it doesn't work. The food is like the girl at the party who just tries too hard. She seems like she has everything right, but there is just something off about her, especially when you look at her closely. The food all sounds really good on the menu, but when it comes out it is just heavy. They seem to rely more on the use of heavy creams and butters to try and make the dish taste good instead of seasonings. I cannot find anything on the menu that I like. I tried the salmon- it was very dry. They do not have a wide selection of salads  that appeal to me either.  The Caesar is just ok. I did not like the asian salad. My dad loves the wedge salad though. I also did not like the flavor of the french onion soup.  My husband always gets the macaroni and cheese. It is good, but again very heavy and he always gets a stomach ache. I do eat a little seafood, but there are no vegetarian options under the entre section.   We also came here for cinco de mao. It adverstised an all you can eat mexican buffet. It was pretty terrible. The churros were rock hard and inedible. The rest of the food was mediocre and limited.   We did come for Easter brunch and it was excellent. I would do that again in a heartbeat. That was the only time i have been truly happy here.   I guess the menu just needs to be revamped to include lighter, healthier, more organic fair if they want to charge the higher prices.   Also, they have live music a lot on the patios and leave the doors open. I know a lot of people there are hard of hearing, and they cannot have a conversation because the music is so loud.

I get serious cravings for this place. I want it right now.  I just wish it was closer and I would eat there so much more. We used to go there a lot when I was in school. It is the best pho I have ever had. It is delicious and amazing. I do not know how they do it. It has so many great vegetables inside it, and the broth is so aromatic.  I also left my wallet there one day. I didnt realize it till 800 PM the NEXT day as I was leaving for the AIRPORT! OMG I was freaking out. I called and they were closing. I was so scared I wouldnt be able to get on the plane. I told them my situation and one of the employees stayed in his car till I got there 25 minutes later, after they were closed. He wouldnt even take a tip! I had to throw the money in his car and leave. It was so wonderful of them, and I will never forget it. I was able to get on the plane and it worked out.  I have nothing more to say about this place. It has great food. Its is super cheap. It comes out fast. Its healthy. What more can you want? Go there right now.

I love taking my baby to gymboree. It has been a great experience. I feel that it has really accelerated her development and learning.  It is now under new management and is undergoing changes. I will update my review again after everything settles. Miss Chris was the previous owner and was amazing. She lead every class and provided a ton of developmental information and enthusiasm. I think she will be hard to replace. The best thing about gymboree was that you had unlimited classes. I could take my baby 4 days a week plus open gym for 60 something a month. They are supposed to get rid of that feature in April, if they do, then I will probably cancel my membership. I think having unlimited keeps more students in the class which enhances my babies interactions and learning. When she was in level 2, there were very few babies and most classes were empty, this made me wait to sign up for level 3, where there were more kids and more fun. Also, my work schedule keeps changing and I have different days off, it is way more convienent to pick and choose what class I go to. I do not see why it matters if you go to more than one class, the instructors still need to be there so I am not sure how they will save money. Anyways, that's just my 2 cents. I hope it stays unlimited so I have a great place to take my baby.

I was a first time mom, so finding a local doctor was really important to me. I researched a lot of places. I went to a few meet and greets at local pediatrician offices. I really did not like those, they were crowded and you did not really get any personal interaction. Plus the doctor leading them would not necessarily be your child's doctor.  Dr Sarmiento was different. He met with us personally in his offices for about 20 minutes free of charge. It was nice to actually sit down and ask questions. He was very friendly and cracked a few jokes.  I knew right away that I wanted him to be my babies doctor.  I do not regret my decision and have followed him through the different banner offices he has been assigned to. He is now in surprise and I still go to see him even though it is a little farther. I highly recommend this doctor.

Oh yum. Why have I never been into El Pollo Loco before?  My whole family loves it. If we have a lot of people over, we order one of their big meals with all the sides. They are so good. I always order a large macaroni and cheese and usually eat half of it.  They have really good salsas too. If you are going through the drive thru, make sure you request some of their extra salsa- particularly their green one. It is so good. My husband also ask for Anaheim chilis to add some spice to his. He usually goes here for lunch once a week and gets the bowls.  I only wish they had a few vegetarian options and this location does not have horchata. Bring me some horhcata! It is so tasty and I wish it was there.

This place is sooo good. I love supporting local bakeries. I have only been once but loved everything I had. I got the French macaroons and am still thinking about them. I also ordered a cake for a baby shower. Everyone was like ugh I don't like cake but then they had this and were so surprised. They loved it. It was so light and refreshing. Also if you are looking for a great gift, get a box of chocolate.

I come here a lot. The wait never seems too bad. It is nice when you just need to get something quick like antibiotics. The facility is nice and clean.  The PA's seem knowledgeable and kind. They want to help you. If you can't get into your primary care doctor, and you aren' having an emergency check them out!

This is my go to yogurt place. There are tons of yogurt shops nearby, but they do not compare to yogurtology.  Why do I like it? First, they have the boon highchairs which I have at home. I can just roll my baby down the line and fill up my cup with yogurt treats. It saves me from having to carry her, plus they are great high chairs.   I also love how they have bottoms. What is a bottom? This goes before the yogurt. It creates the foundation for your yogurt experience.  The flavors are great and unique. I can't decide which one I like best. If you are stuck, ask the yogurt girls for a sample. It will point you in the right direction.  Finally the toppings are some of the best. They have so many unique ones. I love the pink boba- they just explode. Its great.   Also I forgot to mention they have cones. My dad is old school and hates any place with out a cone, so he is happy going here.

This place is ok but not great for the price. I like the Mongolian but would like to pick out my own sauce though. The sushi is ok. I haven't had a roll there that has a good flavor. I like the different dishes on the buffet. I wish I could have tried some crab legs but its like Black Friday there. People are standing around and then they take them all. It is so rude. Then it takes forever to get another order out. They should bring orders to the tables so people don't go crazy and take them all.  What really got me though was the dessert table. It was all Costco dessert. They didn't even take the cakes off the cheap plastic trays to make them look homemade. It just looked like a potluck where the families swung by the grocery store and picked out a cheap cake. For 15 dollars at least try to fool me.  I won't be back.

This was an awesome service. I now cannot have a party without having them! I am ruined!  Everything was great with the service. They were responsive and did exactly as quoted. We had them bring a bar, mixers, and ice. It was perfect. We provided the alcohol from bev mo which helped reduce the price. Plus we can return what we didn't use.   Stephen was our bartender and he was fantastic! He was personable and nice. He showed up on time and set up before the guests arrived. He was quick and efficient. All the guests loved Stephen. We will definitely use him again if we have another shin dig! Thanks guys!

I really loved this store. I had never heard of it before. I just wish there was one closer.   What I liked about it was how the store was divided into sections by color. It made it really easy to pick out different jewelry and clothes. I found so many cute things here. I just wish there was one closer to Peoria. Or maybe I don't because then I would be there all the time.  The prices were also were reasonable. Great store!

I love Saigon Kitchen. For a while, we were heading there every weekend. It had just gotten too crazy though with all the snowbirds. I hate driving down Bell rd this time of year. So we havent gone in a while and having been ordering take out from Pholicious.  But that does not mean it isn't good. Its is great. I love the atmosphere. It is more upscale and classy compared to most Vietnamese places. It also has an interesting menu with so many things I want to try. I just can't not order Pho though. It is so tasty and healthy. I feel like a better person when I order pho. The pho here is great. It comes out fresh and hot, tons of veggies. My husband gets the pho thair and he loves it.  He actually prefers this place over pho tahn because it is classier. I like the pho better at the other place, but will go to either one. They are both about the same distance from my house. Plus this one has beer and drinks.  The service is always excellent. The staff is very friendly and loves our baby. They always make sure she is comfortable there. My only complaint is that they charge a lot for the small side of rice we give her.   It is fun going to Surprise and seeing all the snow birds trying this place. At first they are a little nervous, and get the simple things on the menu that are familiar. Then I see them looking at my soup. They always ask us what it is and say they are going to order it next time, and they are so happy they decided to try this place even though it was "different" and "not their usual". So go on Surprise snowbirds, try Saigon Kitchen, don't be scared, its fresh healthy and delicious. Try the pho!

I love the cupcake cafe. I first found them when I was pregnant and had a cupcake craving. They were so satisfying that I still have cravings even though I am not pregnant anymore.   The owner is so nice and always remembers us when we stop by. She goes to a lot of farmers markets so be sure to add her on Facebook to see where she is at that weekend. Also make sure to get there early because she can sell out quickly.  My favorite thing to get it the sampler packs because you can get a lot of variety with small bites.

This review is for the shot clinic they had in May, 2013. I have been to several shot clinics and have been in and out in an hour or so when I was at the back of the line. Here I was the 6th person in line, and waited about 2 hours. The vet was so slow. He would spend 20-30 minutes with a dog. It was crazy. This is a shot clinic, intended to just get in and out. If you want to have a regular vet visit, go to your vet. I don't have time for this with a toddler running around. I just need my dogs to get shots. We then had blood drawn, and waited another 20 minutes to get the results (the test took 5 minutes) This shot clinic wasted my whole saturday. I was not happy.

We went here over the weekend to get lamps. It was moderately busy on the first floor, but only 1 customer on the second floor. I already knew what lamps I wanted to buy, so we waited around in the area for assistance. There was only 1 older sales associate on the floor, and she was with a customer, so we knew we needed to wait. So we waited, and waited, and waited. The sales associate never acknowledge us or even had a friendly look in our direction. I understand she was busy answering questions, but she could have said "I will be with you in a moment, or let me call someone to help you." Instead she just had a snotty demeanor. I felt like I was in pretty woman and they didn't want me to shop there.  I eventually flagged down a stock associate to try and help me. He was ok, not unfriendly, just seemed busy and did not want to help me. They also did not have the lamps I wanted in stock, so it was a wasted trip.

My husband and I finally had a chance for a date night. We wanted to do dinner and movie. After looking at reviews and show times, I saw that we could hit their happy hour and then catch the flick. The happy hour is advertised as 3-6 M-F where everything is half off. So we planned our Friday date around that.  So husband got off work early so we could hit the happy hour. It was packed!. We got there around 525 and there was already a wait. The place was packed! Fortunately, the bar was available so we sat down there. Well, we were in for disappointment because we found out that they no longer do that amazing happy hour on Fridays. You just have some drink specials and a smaller menu. We were very sad. We picked ourselves up by the bootstraps and carried on though, and ordered from the happy hour menu. I ordered the shrimp poppers and he got the fish fry. The fish fry is all you can eat. Anyways, we enjoyed our drinks and waited for our food.  The food came and my husbands fish were chicken tenders. They also ran out of cocktail and tartar sauce. Now I know you are thinking? Well, why are they ranking this place 4 stars? Sometimes it is not about the experience, but how they handle it and fix things. People are busy and are going to make mistakes. Johnny Foxes recognized that they messed up, and they gave us a big discount on the meal. That is true customer service and we appreciated that.  So would I go there again? Yes I would. They offered excellent customer service and I appreciated that.   PS they have groupons a lot so keep you eye out

I went with some of my classmates. They were pretty nervous about nigerian food, but the great reviews sold them. So we headed over there on our lunch break. We were pleasantly surprised. It was pretty awesome.  The owner was so friendly and nice. She really took care of us and seemed genuine.   I checked in and got a drink for 3 dollars. Let me tell you, this drink was amazing. It was fruity and full of alcohol, but you didnt realize how much alcohol (thats the best kind!) I loved it. I wish I could have had more, but I would have to be carried out.  The food was so good. My friends ordered dishes like the yassa chicken and jerk chicken. One friend ordered pepper soup and did not know tripe was in it. She tried to eat it, but could not get past it, so be warned! We also had the Puff Puff. Order those. They are amazing. Oh soo yummy.  I didn't rate 5 stars because of the lack of vegetarian options. She had to mix something up for me. I wish there was a vegetarian soup or entree on the menu. It would have made the experience great for me.

Just go here. It is delicious. Nothing better on a hot Phoenix day.  This isn't your American snow cone. This is fresh shaved ice with fresh fruits and juices. I haven't had anything like it before. I got mango and strawberry with leche. Me and the baby loved it. My husband had a spicy lime chile mango tamarind creation that he devored. The owners were very nice.

We had a great breakfast here last week. We were seated right away even though it was crowded.The owner was very friendly. She brought out a you bag for our toddler to play with and was very accommodating. I just wish they had more than 1 high chair. My husband had to hold our toddler till it became available.   I ordered the famous French toast and my husband ordered the special eggs Benedict. I really enjoyed his eggs Benedict. I hope it becomes a staple. My French toast was really good too but we both loved the eggs.   All in all it was a great experience and if we are in that part of town, we will be back.

I had so much fun and ate so many delicious things. Hmmm what did we have this day?? We had grilled cheese, giant rootbeer floats, chicken satay, fresh made sorbet, Mexican popsicles, crab rolls. I am still stuffed and it was a week ago. I cannot wait for next year.  I was scared because I read some of the reviews from 2012, but they definitely improved it from last year. There were tons of trucks and they were all serving a variety of dishes. I wish I could have hit them all.  The lines were not bad when we got there, but we got there at 1130. When we left around 1330, it was pretty busy.   Bring a lot of cash though, it was pretty expensive. I spent more than I wanted. Also, they only would give you tickets by paying with a credit card at the front tent, not the ones inside. This was kind of a hastle.  At the end of the day, we were left with 6 tickets. They would not buy them back which was a little frustrating. My friend ended up buying a t-shirt though, so it worked out well. So if you have extra tickets, buy a shirt!

This place was awesome. We had a groupon and went the day before fathers day. It was not crowded at all. The buffet was really good. It tasted fresh. There was not a lot on the buffet but you could order plates and it was included. We ordered huevos rancheros and a fruit plate on the side. They came out fresh and super tasty. We also had about 7 mimosas each. They had 3 different kinds. I recommend the tamarindo mimosa and the glasses were so fun.It was so delish. The best part was you could barely taste the juice because it was mostly champagne. The service was really friendly even when we knocked over our glasses. I highly recommend going here.

This sushi was really good. The selection of rolls were adequate. It was standard sushi fare. If you are in the neighborhood and want some sushi, head on over.   It has groupons often, so keep an eye out for those. Also, check in and you can get 10% off the bill.  I took my baby- she goes with me all over. She loved eating the rice we ordered, I just wish they didnt charge so much for a side for her.   I found the music weird. It went from hardcore rap to house music, but there were a lot of snowbirds in there. I am not sure they know what they want to be or their customer base. Or maybe these snowbirds are into that kind of music.

I love food truck Friday. I wish I could get down there more often. It has so many wonderful trucks. I love short leash, the creme brûlée truck, the Korean street food, and so many more. Its great to go with a bunch of people and share the dishes. You get to try so much variety for not a large amount of money. It gets busy, so make sure you get there early to get in line and grab a seat!

I love chipotle. I think it has fresh and delicious options. I was turned off for a while because my usual chipotle on Thunderbird gave me a salad with a giant green bug crawling in it. I finally wanted it again and went to this one. They were nice and the food was great. My usual chipotle experience.

This is one of my staples for lunch on the west side. We don't have many healthy options here, so I usually go here about 1 time a week. I always get the broccoli cheddar soup and possible a salad. I like to get my baby a little PBJ kids meal, and sometimes I eat some of that. The cookies are so good, but I try to avoid them (unsuccessfully) to still eat healthy. I either go to this one or the one on N 67th and the 101.  It can get pretty busy, but this one has lots of seating. The people are always nice and friendly. Sometimes I get confused by how to order. I am used to its sister store Panera where you just go to a counter. Here I always get stuck behind sandwich people and don't know if its ok to cut ahead of them to the salad or soup area.  One thing I wish Paradise would start doing that Panera does is give those cute little apples with meals. I loved those! I would always give them to my horse. It was the perfect horse treat.

Wow! A few weeks ago I was wondering "who still goes to a library?" Little did I know what great kids programs that libraries offer. I took my baby here for a play group and it was great. We sang songs, had bubbles, and tons of toys to play with. There was even parachute time. Now I am wondering why I am even paying for gymboree when this is offered for free.  The library also has a great kids section with tons of books, computers, toys, and an outside play area. This is the place to go to bring your kids. I am so excited to check out the other classes!

This place was ok, I would give it 2.5 stars. I bought a living social deal for this place. I liked how their system was all computer based and they emailed me reminders and I could change it online. The living social deal seemed like a good deal but I don't think I got very much of a treatment out of it. The people were all very nice and friendly. I enjoyed talking with the girl who did my facial.  Now why the 2 stars? Well, the place itself is a little long in the tooth but I don't really care too much about that if the service is good. I wish that I had read the review before about the eye brow wax. The same thing happened to me. She spent a ton of time doing my brows, and I thought these have to be good. She also did provide a mirror at the end, so when I got in my car I was shocked. My eyebrows were sooo thin, and there was a part that was so thin, it was pretty much bald. So now I am having to fill my eyebrows in everyday. It is very frustrating. They are starting to grow back, but it isnt pretty since I have to let it all fill in. Another part that irked me was that the facial did not include extractions, so she said it was an additional charge. The charge was 15 dollars, that just seems like way too much money for extractions, so with that, the deal really wasnt that great.   If you do like this place or want to go, they will still give you the same price for a living social deal even if you do not have a deal, you just need to ask.   So all in all, I have just experienced better places with better results so I will not be going back.

I give this place 3.5-4 stars. We went there last night wanting very spicy food. We were seated right away. The restaurant has nice fun decor. We got our chips and salsa very quickly. The salsa was the spiciest sales we have had at a restaurant. It was vey good and flavorful.  We also ordered guac. It was so tasty. I loved every bite of it. My husband asked the waiter what the spiciest dish was and he recommended adovado enchiladas. I got red chile cheese enchiladas. I was so scared they were going to be spicy so I ordered sour cream as a chaser. I also ordered a house margarita. The baby got a side of beans for her second dinner.  The food was very good. It had nice flavor and was very tasty. It didn't live up to the spicy hype. I had no problems eating mine. I didn't even need water. It was still good but I was on a spicy mission and wanted my husband to sweat. He still enjoyed his meal and said he would go back. Maybe we went on an off spicy night? Not sure but our search continues for spicy food...  Overall good food, decent service, tasty chips (I wish they were endless though)

This place has really interesting plants. If you want something unusual that isnt sold at the big box stores, you should check it out. We just bought a mango tree and so far it is doing well. Shamus spends a lot of time telling you what to do with the plant and gives great advice and tips. You can tell this is a guy who loves his plants. Follow him on facebook for updates on what plants he is selling and when he will be in the garden.

I love the red velvet! It has many chocolate chips in it. What I also like is the bundtinis. These are smaller than your average cupcake and you can get a variety pack. Variety is the spice of my life and I love to try many different things. They have a set pack of their top flavors that is always ready to go. If you want a custom pack, you should call ahead because it takes a while for them to get it together. They have to take the cakes out of the freezer and get them to room temperature. That is the one thing that I didnt really like. I don't like how the cakes are frozen and not fresh. They taste great though, so I guess its not really a problem.   I have also gotten the larger size bundts and they are just as tasty. They can be decorated very cute too, with fun things in the middle.   The people who work here are always very nice and friendly. They greet you and want to help you right away. They can give you the run down of the place.  Also, my friend had these at her wedding in San Francisco. They were a hit! I recommend them for something different than cakes or cupcakes.

I really enjoyed my experiencer here. It is a new facility, so it is really nice. There are so many places I have gone to where the massage chairs don't work, so its nice to go to a place where they all are ready to go.  The girls doing nails were all really nice and friendly. The prices seemed normal for the area. I had a manicure and pedicure. It was nice because she cleaned off my wedding rings after the manicure which no one has done before.  I also had my eyebrows done and she did them nicely.  Overall a great experience and I will be back.

I liked Angelinas. It was really nice inside. I was surprised. We went on a Wednesday afternoon and it wasn't too crowded.  I liked their high chair there. It had a big tray that I could put the baby's food on so she could eat. It made the experience even more enjoyable.  All 3 of us ordered pho. What I did not like was the limited amount of pho on the menu. I had to tell the waiter I wanted tofu and vegetable pho. There was no vegetarian option on the menu. There was also a lot of different broths which made it more complicated. My dining friends both got chicken pho. We also ordered 2 appetizers- a salmon roll with cream cheese, and spring rolls.  The salmon rolls were so good. We all enjoyed them. They were super tasty. I did not try the spring roll but my mom ate it all and said they were good.  The pho came out and it was piping hot, so it took a while to eat. It was really good though. A little too many vegetables in mine which made it hard to eat. They tempura fried the tofu and it was delicious but fell apart a little easily. My family enjoyed their chicken pho, but my Aunt was disappointed she did not have any veggies in hers. Only meat and the stuff you add in. I had to give her some of my vegetables.  The people there were really nice. They laughed at what a mess my baby made so that was good. The owner came out and talked to my aunt and gave her a hug.   Overall it was a good experience and I will be back. Hopefully they put a vegetarian option for the pho. Also it was expensive pho too, so that is why it is not 5 stars

YUM! I love anything grilled cheese and this place did not disappoint. I was able to check out this truck at the Streets Food Festival. I got there early and luckily the line for this truck was not too bad. When we were leaving, the line was crazy. There is a reason though. The grilled cheese was delicious. I got to try a brie and green apple grilled cheese. Oh I still dream of this concoction. It was just crispy enough and had so much delicious cheese. I just wish it was bigger or that i ordered too. My husband had a grilled cheese with fritos, spicy cheese, pork and he was amazed. He does not get excited by food, but he got excited by this. We loved it. Follow them on facebook. They are franchising their trucks, and keeping a truck in Phoenix now. I will definitely be going again. It is also owned and ran by veterans- so I felt even better giving them my money.

I saw a living social deal for this shop. It is located in a new studio suites right next to Ooaka HIbachi (sp?) I had a really good time here. The shop is very nicely done. I love all her fine touches. It is very sleek and modern and kept very clean. I also enjoyed my time with DIane. She is very nice and can keep a conversation going.  She did a really nice job on my nails. She spent a lot of time shaping and trimming the cuticles. I got the gel nails and love my color. I can't wait to go back to try the pedicures that come with a free beer or margarita. Thats the stuff I like to do- get my nails done and have a nice drink.   I would definitely recommend checking her out!

Wow. I have a love hate relationship with this place. I love it because my husband gets so happy here, I hate it because he spends so much money here. I love how much he gets for his money though. Its amazing. He was in the best mood yesterday after leaving here. He is amazed by the deals he keeps getting.   Not only are the prices reasonable and discounted, they have groupons a lot. So for 30 dollars you get 70 to spend in the store. Its ridiculous. We have had like 10 groupons so far. Its crazy. He has gotten so many good deals.  Check this place out. Or send you husband with a groupon, then ask him to get you something expensive. He will be so happy and riding off his shopping high, he will get you a coach purse or something nice.   Just remember to look for a groupon though, it makes it even sweeter.

The ordering was a little confusing, and took me a minute to understand. You have to find which bag station has the sandwich you want and then mark off what you want on it,    I really liked the sandwiches. They were very tasty. I had a vegetarian hummus. I ordered a kids pizzawich for the baby. It came with a drink and tiny rice krispy treat (I ate). She really liked it. The bread was easy for her to chew and tasty. My sandwich was really good too. I really like the bread- I think that made the sandwich.  I went a few weeks after it opened and it was still pretty busy. It took a long time to get the sandwich and to order, but that is to be expected.  This is a great addition to the Arrowhead area and I wish it success.

I did not have a good experience here. We went on a Tuesday night, and it was not very crowded. I had called that morning and left a message, but no one called me back, so I had to call again a few hours later.  When we arrived, not all of our party was there, but the host was very adamant to seat us even though we wanted to wait. We wanted to order drinks while we waited, but no one came back for a while. Then the rest of our party arrived and we ordered drinks. They took a long time to get here.  Afterwards we wanted to order appetizers, but no one showed back up for over 15 minutes. We finally had to flag someone down and we were just so frustrated, we ordered dinner. We then waited for a while, and the food started cooking for a table that arrived after us.   Our chef arrived and started cooking. He was nice and the fried rice was good. He messed up the order and gave me the wrong dish, so I had to give it to my husband. He then forget my friends dish, and did not get her meal cooking until the end. My husband only ordered steak while most people ordered surf and turf. He noticed that everyone else had the same portion of steak as he, but also their shrimp.  All in all it was a frustrating experience and I will not be back. The food was tasty though.

This place is really good. We went there last night because of the all day happy hour. There were a ton of selections for rolls under the happy hour. There were also a lot of different kinds of rolls not on the happy hour menu that you could choose. We got a shrimp tempura roll, california roll, vegetable roll, and a mexican roll. I did not care too much for the vegetable roll, it  lacked a little flavor. I guess I would have liked more of tempura style veggies in it. The rest of the rolls were very good. The price was excellent. My husband had a bento box with teriyaki chicken. He said it was pretty good. The salad did not have the ginger dressing we liked, and we are used to getting tempura veggies in the boxes but the chicken was good.  The service was very friendly. One complaint is there were no descriptions for the sushi, so I had to keep asking what was in each roll.  Overall a good experience and we will be back cause of the price.

I would probably give this place 3.5 stars but I am rounding up. The food was good. We had a Coney Island, fries, macaroni salad, and the Greek salad.  The Greek salad had really good homemade dressing.  I liked the macaroni salad but I like most macaroni salads.  My husband enjoyed his coney and the fries were freshly fried. The only problem was how long it took to get everything. I think we waited about 25 minutes and there were not many people ahead of us.  I think they have a few kinks to work out in the kitchen. Overall a good place and I wish it success.

Very nice clean shop. It is very hip and modern.  The lady is very friendly. She takes good care of the place.   We went and had 2 of their teas with boba. It came out fast and delicious. I was too full from dinner to try the yogurt but it looked good. My husband was excited cause they have coconut yogurt. The toppings looked good. I liked how they dispensed the dry toppings.  Will be back soon.

Went here again today and I enjoyed it a lot more. I mixed it up and had the shrimp tacos with corn tortillas. They were really good. I would order them again. The corn tortilla was a little chewy, I wish they had better tortillas. The shrimp and fillings were great though. My mom enjoyed her taco as well.  I got it in a flight and it came with chips. I got the croquettes again and they were a little mushy.  The service was friendly and good.  Hopefully they continue this upswing as they get more experienced! I will be back.   Oh I had the brushfire salsa and it was good!
