Great local spot! I actually discovered Jackson's while on a flight to Vegas. I met the owners who invited me to come check out their great bar food and cheap drinks. They were super friendly and down to earth so naturally, I was excited to experience a "non-touristy" laid back bar in Vegas. Open 24/7. Divey. Jukebox. Video poker. Long story short, Jackson's is off the strip, it will cost you a $15 cab ride from the strip. But with impeccable service, cheap drinks & delicious bar food (think giant soft pretzels, massive breakfast burritos, spicy boneless wings, nachos....everything super tasty), the cab fare is more than worth it! Never did see the owners again, but bartenders Keith and Billy aka the "Liver Assassin" made us feel right at home!

One of the best French bistros in America! And it's in Vegas?!!  The ambiance of this place brings me back to Paris. Which is appropriate, considering it's located at the Paris Hotel & Casino :-). We had brunch here on a Sunday afternoon, so it was obviously very busy. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive despite the fact that she had multiple tables to serve. We started with adult beverages and the onion soup. C'est magnifique! The soup was warm and savory with very robust flavors. Lots of gruyere cheese and baguette slices to accompany. The beer selection is rather European as well. I opted for a Blanche du Bruxelles, a Belgian white brewski with hints of spices & citrus, while my boyfriend had a Kronenbourg, which I have always referred to as the French Miller Lite due to its light lager flavor. For our entr√©e, we split the seafood crepes.....scallops, shrimp, peas and cream.....to die for! On your next trip to Vegas, this place is a must stop!

My BFs parents paid for this hotel as a birthday gift, so I was excited and grateful for a free place to stay on the strip. From the moment we stepped inside, we experienced horrible service! The front desk attendants were rude and inattentive. Our room keys stopped working on 2 different occasions. The place looks and smells like it hasn't been renovated in decades! It reeked of stale nicotine covered in potpourri sprayed with old lady musk perfume. There is nothing exciting going on. No cool restaurants or bars inside. The bed in our room was super uncomfortable and the bathroom tiles were cracking and stained. Not my scene or crowd. Totally staying at The Cosmopolitan next time!  I give it one star for being on the strip and centrally located to everything!

Great service. Rubbish food. But I guess that's to be expected in an airport terminal. Iced coffee was just alright. I've had way better. Caesar side salad had pieces of rotten & brown lettuce. And my Tuscan chicken wrap came out with nothing but lettuce on it.  There was literally zero chicken anywhere to be found. I had to send it back and request another one. The new one they send out was just as bad. Won't be back. Waste of money.
