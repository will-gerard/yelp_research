I've had better... waaaay better. First of all, I am not scared off by the way the place looks, at all, yes, it might not be located in one of the most affluent or desirable of neighborhoods, but that doesn't present a problem for me. If there is good food, it doesn't matter. Second of all, the tortillas ARE very good, no doubt about it, but that might be the ONLY good thing we got out of our visit to that place. Me and my family were looking for a place to go eat menudo, we wanted a real good, flavorful menudo, and while we were driving, Yelp! took us there, with the promise of good menudo. When we got there, there was a line, but that only meant to us, that there was good food too. We were looking at the menu, while moving up to the cashier, and noticed that they do not serve menudo... like EVER! So, that was a little deceiving. (The website says they have it on Saturdays, but that is the day we visited and NADA!) When we got there, my kiddos got a bean and cheese burrito, which, if it wasn't for the good tortillas, it would have been the same as ordering one at taco bell. My hubby ordered the Oaxaca style burrito, that had nothing very "Oaxacan" about ("Beef Chorizo with Beans, Potatoes, Cheese"... Oaxaca, me think not!), along with a tamal, don't remember what kind, didn't mater, wasn't good either. I ordered the green chile beef, which I was looking forward to. When we got our order, our kids enjoyed their burritos, my husband was OK with his, enjoyed the tortilla very much, but said that nothing special, and me, when I started eating it, a white goo came flowing out... it looked like the sticky goo we use to make home-made piñatas called "Engrudo", which is a mix of hot water and enough flour to get a gooey consistency, and I think that's what they served me with some chunks of tenderly cooked beef. I went up to the cashier, and told her that my green chile wasn't green, that it looked like "engrudo," she said that was the green chile, I asked "Is it supposed to look like this?" she gave me a little shy smile and said yes... the ladies making the tortillas just looked up and smiled at me, and I went back to my seat, opened up my burrito, picked out the beef chunks, scraped off the goo, and ate my tortilla... So, no. If you ask me if I am going back to Carolina's again, my answer is no. It too long of a ride, too bad of a food for me to do that. Like I said, I've had better... and will post pics to show you the whitish "engrudo" goo they served me... yuck! ** Good thing I didn't get a cockroach in my burrito, like the other lady, that would have been so terrible!

We had a great time at Castles & Coasters!! We played a round of mini golf with the kiddos, and they enjoyed it to the fullest. But our favorite was the racing carts, that is such a fun-filled activities to do with the little ones, it was exciting and different! The arcade was full with fun games you play for tickets, which are now digital, and are added to the card that you buy along with your credit. We'll be back to play more at the arcade, to race carts, try the roller coaster and also to do the bumper boats!!

It is payless. I was desperate to find inexpensive "fancy-looking" shoes for my son who had a concert in school. We were greeted promptly, helped by the young girl in charge. We found what we were looking for un less than 5 minutes. Good service.

Me, and a group of ladies, were getting ready to travel to Payson, and while we were putting gas in my van, we noticed the flat tire. We took it to Discount Tires, and even though it was a busy day for them (Friday), they took care of us in a timely manner. They took a big nail, out, patched it up, and got us ready to go, and all this... for FREE! They are great, great customer service, Erik is the gentleman that took care of our problem.

This is the closest Albertsons/Osco store, and am totally happy to be able to go there. It is always nice and clean, produce is always fresh and of great quality, fish looks as fresh as it can get being in here in the Valley. Love the specials they run seasonally, and love the array of goods I can find there. Overall, I really like this place!

This place is very conveniently located, just off of the I-10, on the 43rd Ave exit. They have everything that you need for big parties, or if you just need to buy in bulk. Prices are pretty fair too.

It's been a long time since we've been to this location, they have expanded onto the next door space, and added a small bar area. Now, with 3 kids in tow, and my littlest one a very wiggly toddler, I was getting anxious!  Now that I am a parent and am looking for kid-friendly but not-fast-food-places to go eat with the family, I thought we had made a mistake by going there, it didn't feel very "kid-friendly", plus my wiggly toddler started throwing her crayons all over, while her older siblings helped out by grabbing them. I thought the server was going to be annoyed, and our neighboring customers were going to get upset, but none of that was true. I am not a parent that lets my kids run wild, but my daughter was being a little loud, so I took her to the bathroom, had a little talk with her, and I don't know how much her little mind grasped of what was going on, she behaved really good, and customers and server were really helpful by not staring, not giving us the "eye", and actually interacting with us, and asking us her age :D We had the Hummus and Chicken from the appetizer section for the little ones, that comes with pita bread, they all enjoyed it, and had enough for us to try it too.  My hubby got the Wood-fired Fresh Salmon with Garlic Mashed Potatoes and wilted Spinach. He loved it, I thought it was really good, although he didn't leave enough to try everything, that's how good it was. Me, I got the the Lavosh Shawarma Wrap, with grilled chicken, tomatoes and onions, and it came with a side Greek Salad. The wrap was very good, but the salad was and eye opener, as far as the knowledge of how something so easy to prepare be so good. We've been making our own Greek Salads here at home for lunch, and dinner, yummy!! So, don't feel intimidated if you have little ones, but still want to enjoy of some very good, healthy food outside the house. The servers are really good, the atmosphere is very eclectic and fun, and food is delicious!!

Super good sweet Mexican bread, soft, and delicious. But beware, be prepared to wait in line, there is always a line waiting to get the goodies. We got tamales (green, red, and rajas), the green and rajas were good, but the red chile were bland.  Haven't tried their Menudo, that is only sold during the weekend, nor the burritos, which I am guessing are filled with the same green and red chile.

We did the "Buffet of Buffets", and this was our first stop, and man, was it worth it! Just the Crepes alone made our day, we went 2 times for breakfast, we loved the Crepe station, the first day we ordered the Sweet kind, and the second day, we had the savory ones, wow!!  Delicious!  All the stations had something really good to offer, like the omelet stations, the meats and deli, sausages, bacon, you name it!!  All kinds of preparation for potatoes: roasted, a la Dauphinoise, scalloped, fried, mashed, etc! Salads, sweets, loved the dessert presentations!! Gotta try it!

This place is great!! We've been there a couple of times, first with some friends or ours that are regulars, so the staff and the chef already knows them, and know what they like and how they like it. We were treated really good, and the different dishes we tried were soooo good. Between the crepes, and the fish in garlic sauce. Second time we went, we went on our own, and we were treated really good, too. It made no difference that they don't know us, and were not in the company of regulars, their service staff is great, attentive, and always on top pf things. I recommend it highly!

Me and my family always enjoy making a special trip to Costco, we love it there!! Love the different brands they carry, the quality, and the goodies they have to offer as samples. It works, because now we are hooked on some items after sampling them one day. Like the Babba Foods Hummus, Pita Chips, and Flatbread, whenever they have the on display, we always get them!  They have a very good Optical department, my boys, both have had a visit to their Ophtalmologist, and have had their prescriptions filled there as well. And we always plan on eating lunch-dinner there, it's an adventure for the kids, and it's not draining to our pockets!!  We go for the pizza by the slice (huge portion), the hot-dogs (comes with a soda), and the CHURROS!!

We've been to Georges many times in the past, when we used to live over in that area. This last visit was very deliberate, since I am never in that neck of the woods, and me and my hubby decided that we would stop and eat lunch there. We always get the original Gyros with fries, or you can have a side salad, that seems to be very good too. My son had the chicken nuggets, since he doesn't like eating many "different" things, so we go with the safest option for him. He seemed to enjoy them, they looked pretty generic to me, but they came with a mound of fries, that he shared with his little sister.    The gyros were as usual, very good, with the perfect amount of tzatziki sauce, and onions and tomatoes. The pita bread was soft and good. Overall, it was really yummy, and although I am sure there are many places out there that might have better food, we like it here!!

This is a very nice, family-friendly, gym. We love it that they have a nice kiddie pool with a slide, plus the Olympic pool for more serious swimmers.  But best of all, is the child care... I wouldn't be able to go work out without taking my kids with me, so it's a super plus that they have such dedicated team to care for the little ones, while we try to get in better shape, or better our health. The ladies at the child care in the morning shift rock!!  Kim and Olga are very dedicated to their job, and the kids feel at ease with them.

Dr. Frakes, she's been a great Dr for my daughter. This is a small practice surrounded by different specialists, located right across the street from Kohls. The examination rooms are clean, small, and furbished with the necessary equipment, some of the nurses or assistants might sound a bit tough, but they are actually really efficient. The Doctor's are very nice, and knowledgeable, and approachable. I was told that Dr. Frakes is leaving this practice, but the other Drs are very  good as well. Will definitely keep coming here.

My husband and I decided to go to Tomo for their happy hour ( every day from 3-6pm), before going to the movies. We asked to be seated at the bar, so they did promptly, they had a full house. We started with some Monkey Balls from the Happy Hour menu, which was a very good size portions of mushrooms stuffed with crab meat, cream cheese and fried tempura style, served with 2 different sauces, these were yummy, not soggy at all. Then we got a Sashimi combination that came with a spicy tuna roll, real good. One of their specialty is the Ninja roll, that has jalapeño pepper in the filling and it's served tempura style, as well. Their Crazy roll is also very good, their portions are very generous, and loved being able to see the Sushi masters do their job with excellence, sushi rolls kept coming out non stop with the same level of mastery. Kudos to this establishment!! Will definitely come back!!

I have had to go to this place quite often in the last couple of weeks, however, I am no new customer. They have have different types of services that they offer, they have the children's immunizations on one side of the buildings, that is available for un-insured patients or low income. My kid's are not insured, and this is the best option Vs. paying $300+ per immunization at the Dr's office.     They also have family clinics. I went there to get my immunizations up to date, and to have a 2-step TB skin test required to start school in the Medical Field. The staff on clinic #7 were very helpful, last year I took the skin test, but lost the card with the results that they provide you with, and when I went to ask for a duplicate, they had no problem helping me out with that, no fee, and they also were able to give me all my Lab/immunization history so I could give it to my advisor at school.  I recommend it!

I went there with a group of ladies, to celebrate one of my friend's birthdays. That means, separate check. While we were waiting for our whole group to arrive, we were seated outside, it was about 8pm, the weather was nice, so we were enjoying ourselves, while we were drinking iced tea.  When everybody was there, our waitress, whom wasn't very friendly, asked just out right if it was going to be one single check or separate checks. We said separate checks, she sighed loudly, and made a face, saying that it was going to be a headache to do that, to our astonishment. She didn't wait to be inside the kitchen to express her disappointment about, she was just blatantly rude about it. So we were left in an awkward position right there. We all ordered the Blue Flame, apparently is the popular one, I also ordered the Vegas Roll, because I like it everywhere else I go to eat sushi. Well, needles to say, our glasses were not refilled promptly, our waitress was not making the rounds very often to see how we were doing, even though the place inside was empty, they only had one other table with 4 tops. The Blue flame was ok, not bad. But the Vegas Roll, I didn't recognized it. It wasn't bad, it was just... meh! We were all charged 18% gratuity, of course, and I was left with a very bad taste in my mouth, bad service, mediocre food. Not my first choice, or second, or third.

We really enjoy going to Flavors of Louisiana. It is a very pleasant place to go to. The service is always very attentive, very nice, and clean. We love that they have daily specials, but also, on Mondays our kids eat free, with a paid entreé, what is there not to love. We are a family that enjoys eating, and going out to eat, and this kinds of deals are what we look for, plus, he food is great! We usually get the Po'Boys, me the shrimp, my husband gets either the crawfish or the alligator, when he feels brave enough. I've also had the Chicken and Gumbo dish, with dirty rice and a side of Potato Salad, spicy and delicious! They boys used to get the corn dogs, but have discovered that their catfish is delicious... I have to confess that when they can't finish their dishes, I don't mind at all helping them out with the tasty catfish. All of these with regular French Fries, or Cajun Chips, both are really good. I really do recommend this place! You have got to go!

I really have learned to enjoy a good cup of coffe and a bagel with "shmear," here at Einstein's Bagels. The staff is really friendly, the bagels are super good, and when you sign up for their newsletter, they send you their love in the form of coupons, and discounts! We like getting the "Baker's dozen" of 13 bagels with 2 different shmears (the almond-honey is one of our favorites), from plain to onion, chocolate chip, cranberry, you got to try them all!

After "hearing" everybody here on Yelp rave about this place, me and my hubby had to schedule a date night, and have a our friend babysit for us, so we could enjoy some bruschetta. We were not disappointed, we chose the Central location versus the Arcadia location only because we were on a tight schedule, and it's closer to home. The day we went there it was cold and rainy, inside it was packed, and the outside patio too. They had a waiting time of about 45 minutes, at first we thought, maybe we should come back another day, and were going to go to our usual date-night dinner fare, sushi, at Hana, just down the street... but we persevered, and waited! It paid off, we were called after just 20 minutes of waiting, and were seated at a little table by the wines. The atmosphere was very pleasant, not too loud, although there was a bunch of people at the bar, but I knew they were not there just for the beer, everybody had a bruschetta in front of them!! We ordered some Mimosa and a Bellini, the Cheese Board $14, and the Bruschetta... oh! the Bruschetta! $13.75 for a selection of 4 different types, we ordered the Smoked Salmon Pesto, Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomatoes, Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios, and the Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone. Everything was delicious!! I wanted to talk my husband into order another round of 4 just to try different ones, but unfortunately, we were too full! The service was excellent, and our visit was really enjoyable. We will be going back there soon!!

The service was horrible... the food was fair, but nothing I would go back and eat. The place (structure) is really nice, but the staff is awful.  Our waitress was really nice and all smiles but her service was still lame, we were not greeted when we arrived, we were not given cutlery, napkins, etc until after the food arrived (like 10 min), we could have left without paying since no one was paying attention to us, and the place was almost empty. The food is not the best, we enjoyed the Irish Fries or something, but we had to lick our fingers, and not because they were so delish, but because the napkins and forks were making their way trough the crowds and to our table. When we left, the hostesses were so into their conversation that they didn't see us leave... oh, well! That's what we get for wanting to try something new!

This is our go to place for family outings. All three of my kids enjoy the "Honey-Seared Chicken with Noodles", they love it! And that means that we get to enjoy our lunch/dinner when we eat there. My hubby usually orders the Kung-Pao Beef, which I prefer over the chicken, because the meat gets a caramelization that the chicken doesn't get. And me, I am usually the one that orders the "new" dish that they are introducing, like las week was the "Black Pepper Chicken", which with tender and crunchy asparagus, was a very yummy dish! And it never hurts if you get a BOGO coupon in your inbox every once in a while!!

Ok, I want to start off saying that, this IS indeed a "99ç Store" and I am not expecting the best quality in products, or name brands. I was there looking for the bubble wrap shipping envelopes as I needed to send a little something over to my sister, and didn't want to "splurge" at Walmart or something like that.    I almost missed them, but found a 2-pack of 3M bubble wrap envelopes, and also picked up some cute boxes of M&M mini cookies for my kids after school snacks that they always ask me for.    Although this store is so-so, kind of clean, kind of in order, what made my day was my cashier. The person in front of me was paying for some Valentine knick-knacks and some sandbox toys, and apparently she was short .92ç. As she was struggling to find a dollar or enough change, Nicole the cashier got a dollar bill from her pocket and said "she got it" not to worry about it. The lady was so-so grateful, I would have said "thank You" maybe a couple of times, because this kind of customer service I have never seen before in my life! Kudos for Nicole the Cashier!!

We've been here several times, my kids love it, my husband loves it, I love it! It's so good, my kids forget they are not getting a toy or prize with their meal :P Place is very casual, staff is friendly and helpful, and the food is so good!! Usually in our order we include the kids smashburgers,they are so simple, but so buttery good! with their side of fries that always have enough to go around, however, we like the sweet potato fries, and the smash fries with rosemary and oil!! Husband always orders the Arizona Smashburger, with jalapeños, onions and guacamole! Me, I'm always trying something different, from the Arizona, the regular Smashburger, I also had the Chicken Buffalo smashburger, both grill and crispy, but this time it was not on the menu... I miss it! So I tried the Truffle mushroom with Swiss Cheese... it was so good!! So, go, skip the square burgers and head to smash burger!!

I think that all Victoria's Secrets are essentially the same, but I like this one location in particular because, 1) it's close to home, 2) It doesn't seem like it's always crowded, 3) Service is great! The ladies there are actually very helpful, and friendly, I haven't encountered any stinky attitude, and they've treated me really nice. I recommend this location!

We enjoy coming here with the whole family, especially on Tuesdays, when they have they're Family nights! Before, I would say the quality of the image wasn't so good, you didn't want to come to see a movie with lots of special effects, but that has since changed. Now they have a new, more advanced system that makes a huge difference!! We enjoy bringing our own chairs, blankets (when the weather it's cold), food and drinks! We have dinner there, and if we want, we can go get some popcorn to top off the night! Very Family-centered fun you can enjoy year-round, if you don't mind the extreme heat during the summer!

Noodles are cooked right, and taste so creamy-buttery! The family ordered different things, soup, stir-fry and braised noodles. Everything was yummy, although the service was not the best. They were not very attentive at times, and the girl that gave us our check, almost thwrew it at us (don't know if by accident) saying 'thanks for coming". The 4 stars are based on the food solely, service is lacking.

Love it!! I always get one when I get to go to Food Truck Fridays. My absolute favorite is Sea Salt Caramel, and today, I was lucky to get the last 2!! The large ones are $5, and they have Minis at $3, which is a really good option when you go spend some $$ for lunch and you still want to have dessert!! The Chef/Owner was really friendly and helpful, I recommend you try them whenever you get to catch their truck somewhere in the Valley!

This Fry's Market it's really clean, located on the SE corner of 107th Ave & Indian School. What I really, really love about this location, unlike the one closer to my house, is that they added a "Olives & Antipasti" Bar!!!!! We had to try some of the assortment of olives and antipasti, and we were not left down. I mean, it is a super-market, right? They had a great array of olives, and also artichokes, peppers, mushrooms, etc. We are planning on going back this Friday!!!

Never been to this place before, we visited after having some Plum Wine at a Sushi Restaurant that I wanted to buy for home. We were impressed by the amount and variety of wines, beers and mixes they carry. We would also like to go on a day when they have the classes. I think I would learn a thing or two about food and wine pairings!! Will definitely go back.

Last night, after eyeing this place for the last couple of weeks, I decided to stop by and give it a try. They were turning their "Open" lights off already, but I made my best effort, with my big puppy-eyes, and asked if they could still prepare a "raspado" for me?? The owner said yes, of course, they still had enough for the whole group of people I was talking to just outside of their establishment, after our meeting. Well, sure enough, almost all of us got to enjoy this delicious treat, which is shaved ice, but prepared "Neza"- style. Neza is a suburb in México State, right next to México City. The difference here is that the sweet is not simple-syrup based, but fresh-fruit purée based. It was delicious!!  I had the Cajeta (caramel) my husband got the tamarind, and both were gone in no time. The owners are very nice and funny, don't be scared if they invite you to dance before you order, ok?! Recommend it a 100%

This is the second time I eat here, the first time was surprisingly delicious, and this time, the food kept its momentum, it was also delicious.  I didn't get a chance to try the Papa+Verde, which seems to be very popular because after waiting in line for a long time, when I finally was able to put in my order, they had run out, so I went with the Alejandro The Great Quesadilla, which was Gyro beef, Kalamata Olives, Feta & melting cheese. Was really yummy, and also got the Mango/Peach I believe in the mason jar. The drink was pretty expensive at $4 each, but you get to keep the huge jar, and can bring it back next time for a $1 refill, not bad!!   Will be back to try the Papas-Verdes!!

We didn't get sick. It was a busy day, because they were giving away free food (bean & cheese burritos, and green chili burritos), trying to clean their image after the E. Coli outbreak in another of their locations. It wasn't exactly, it was free! The green chili was just a bit too dry, but I understand that they had to prepare in advance for all the people that was going to show up. So, kudos for them. Great way to advertise.

Yeah! We've been experiencing the Food Truck Fridays since last year, and look forward to it every chance we get to go. Me living in the West Valley, don't have many business doing over downtown PHX, but every once in a while we make it our business to go to FTF!! It gets pretty crowded, the lines can get pretty long, but if you get there early enough as in as soon as they open, then you have no problem, or maybe after rush hour, like 1pm, but they might run out of your favorite dish! We like Hey! Joe's Lechón, Jamburritos' Cajun food wrapped up in a burrito, Luncha Libre's Mexican-Mediterranean concoctions, Torched Godness' Sea Salt Créme Bruleé, Mama Toledo's Raspberry Cheesecake, Taste Rite's Pulled Pork Po'Boys, etc, etc. If you get a chance to visit, go!!!

My hubby found this little gem through yelp (Thanks!!), and as we discussed when to pay them a visit, we got to talk about how it reminded us of all the little donut places in CA.  When we finally went earlier today, and as they were getting ready to replenish more of the filled donuts (lemon, blueberry, raspberry, Bavarian, etc), we got to talk to the young lady helping us, she shared that it's a family owned and operated business, she's at the front counter, her cousin is the baker, and her mom is the owner/manager. They come from Long Beach (no wonder!), and we decided that these are the BEST donuts we have ever had before (including the ones in Cali), so soft and fluffy, and delicious. And they are so friendly, they make you feel very welcome!    We got a dozen of them, my kids enjoyed the classics chocolate with sprinkles, the glazed twisted, I had an orange glaze (yummy), lemon filled, apple fritter;  and there are a couple different ones waiting for us in our pink box. We also enjoyed a regular coffee and a Piña Colada Smoothie with Bobba, yummy!    If you find yourself in the West Valley craving for a good donut, make sure you head this way, you won't be disappointed!!

I really like this Library, is big, spacious, has lots of computers available for the Avondale residents to use. There are computer "pods" near the kids/teenagers reading section, that they can use to either play games or do some research. I like it that they have a separate room where they have the toddler reading time, also, once a week, I believe, they have just Toddler playtime, which is not guided by the staff, but there is someone from the Library staff present to keep everything running smooth. Plushy toys, board books, and different puzzles are available for the little ones to play with. They also have conference rooms that you can use to study, or maybe reserve for a group meeting and such. I like the diversity of books they have available, DVDs, and CDs that you can check out. Recommend it!

I believe Little Caesars are good for one thing, and one thing only! Cheap Pizza! I don't think I have ever ordered anything else from their menu, so I can't say anything negative about it.  We usually get the $5 dollar Pepperoni pizza, this time we also got the cheese one. It is nothing spectacular, it taste like pizza, it is what it is! What I like about this location it's that they have a drive-thru, and this night in particular, the young man that helped us was very friendly and... well, helpful! Good experience.

This branch is a really neat building, located on the NW corner of Dysart and McDowell. The staff is really friendly, and nice, very helpful. I once had a problem that they were able to solve and believe they went above and beyond their duties to accommodate my needs. My new DSFCU location.

My hubby knows one of the owners/instructors from before, so he decided to pay them a visit and see how they were doing. He just started doing BJJ, and my boys started along with him. They are so happy!!  They love it there, the atmosphere is very family-oriented, not oppressive at all, however very disciplined. They can't wait each day for school to be over so they can go train! Kids' classes are: From 5pm-5:55pm M, Th kids Kickboxing, TWF Kids BJJ. Go check it out!!

My husband was looking for a new (to us) sushi place that had a happy hour, since we wanted to enjoy the best of both worlds... Sushi & moderate cost.  It is located on the North side of Bell Rd, right next to a a Nails salon, we almost missed it too. It is a small place, and when we got there, there were only 3 other patrons there, that didn't not discouraged us from trying it out, and I am glad we did. They have a list of sushi rolls that are on the Happy hour menu, which means that they were anywhere from $4-$5 dollars each. We ordered from the happy hour menu, and the regular menu. My husband got the Sashimi-A, which was an assortment of very fresh, and artistically cut pieces of fish (Salmon, Tuna, etc), the Superman Burrito Roll, was fun, and really yummy; Tootsie roll, Vegas roll, and the Tempura Shrimp Roll. As we were finishing our meal, the sushi chef served us some really cool and delicious oranges artistically cut in segments, with some sort of dressing, and a Mochi (Japanese ice cream), compliments of the house. They had one server on that they, that was friendly, an very attentive, he also was able to give me information on the Plum Wine I had with my dinner.  This is not a very fancy place, but it's got delicious food, friendly Staff, and great prices!

This Ross store has been my go-to store for the last 5-6 years... since they open. Very close to my house, no need to travel farther to find the same chaotic scene at the toy aisle. It is very well stocked, but just like any other Ross store, you have to go through every single item on the rack to actually find the correct size on the wrong hanger size. I've always loved the little gems I've found in the kitchen utensils section, you never know!!  Some days are better than others, one day the store looks very clean and organized, and others it's just a mess on the floors. But I guess it is not the store's fault but the clientele. I always try to pick up the toys from off of the floor just so that I can pass, but other people don't care, they let their kids go crazy. I've heard the staff members over the sound system ask the parents to keep their little ones by their side... they might think it's the play area at McDonalds or something!
