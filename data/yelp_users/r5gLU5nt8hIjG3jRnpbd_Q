Great place for a haircut. The staff is always friendly and they have remembered me every time I have been back. They use a straight razor on the neck and behind the ears. A cold beverage also helps keep everything going smoothly. The royal shave package includes a shave with a straight razor. That was intense and long but good. Lots of hot towels to open up the pores.

Dropped my tire off for a flat repair. Hadn't been to the camelback location before but was impressed with the quick turn on the repair and the offer to remount everything while I waited. Great customer service

I had my wife take my xterra there today since it's by her work and there's nothing by mine and we are taking a road trip next week and I needed a tire rotation and wanted my 30k mile inspection done. Somehow that turned into 250 bucks without me authorizing a thing. The main items 120 bucks for a "fuel flush" totally unneeded and 50 bucks for a cabin air filter that was newish 7k miles. What a joke. Definitely not a trustworthy or honest place. Don't go there.

After talking to the owner. Things were resolved. There was some miscommunication. For the record the actual work was done a-ok and my wife's truck has been handled well.

We came here for restaurant week, and won't go back. I had been here before with my wife, buddy and his girlfriend for cocktails. We had a good time, the cocktails were good, albeit on the pricey side, but it was nice.   I wanted to come back and show my parent's the burger selection. My goodness, the food was OK, but the service was atrocious.   First off, my wife called to reserve a table (we assumed it would be busy... LOL). They left her on hold for 8 minutes without ever coming back to the phone. Should have been our first clue. We sat down and were promptly ignored for a while. Finally, after a while we were able to order, and waited for our drinks, which didn't come. We had to ask again, and they came separately. Mind you, it's not very busy either. The food all came at different times, and like I said, was just ok.   Finally, after 2 plus hours, and complaining to the manager, who incidentally pooh poohed our complaints, we got a bill which was wrong. Finally got that corrected, and of course our waiter doesn't even leave us a pen.
