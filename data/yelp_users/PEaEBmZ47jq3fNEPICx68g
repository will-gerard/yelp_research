Gentle people, delicious food, AND excellent prices.  You can find more expensive food but you will have a hard time finding better Thai food.  I drive from North Phoenix past a half dozen other Thai restaurants to eat here.

Any place that wants to charge extra for enough condiments to eat the meal is petty to the extent that they do not warrant my business.  Lose this dump and find some GOOD food...  Yelp lists many business nearby that value their customers and do not charge extra for condiments.  Any business that chooses to lose a customer who spends over $100 per week there over condiments that cost them less than 5 cents is not likely to be in business for long anyway.  Let the buyer beware, there is something VERY wrong at Carl's Jr...

When I inquired about a menu item that clearly came with coffee i was told that they would charge me additionally for the coffee.  In Arizona this is CONSUMER FRAUD!  The employee had the gall to argue that they are permitted to charge a different price than the one that is shown to the public when they collect it for their cash register.  Dispicable people.  Avoid like the plague!  I'd recommend Carl's Jr at 35th and Bell if you are looking for healthy food and a friendly staff.

Excellent food that is well prepared and authentic.  More than one step above the local ...Bertos.  Friendly people.  Sometimes it seems to take as long as it does to get your food in Mexico but the food is well worth the wait and reasonably priced.

I will never eat anywhere where they charge for their condiments.  This place lost a customer who spent over $100 per week there over their insistence to charge for ranch dressing.  These are despicable people with their hands in your pockets.  Find a better place  to eat.  There is good food nearby with friendly service.  This place is not worth the aggravation.

This place SUCKS!!!   I will take my business elsewhere!  Rather than posting no smoking areas, placing something on the tables, or placing tables and chairs that are outside away from no smoking areas they let patrons sit down OUTSIDE and send the NO SMOKING POLICE in the form of a custodian out to inform you that you've got to move.  There was NO indication that you were in their "imaginary" no trespassing area.  I don't think that I violated their rules when they were explained.  This made their bitter and overpriced drinks worse.

I've visited Al's over thirty times in the last 6 or 8 months and have stopped going to other bead stores on a regular basis.  If you are looking for turquoise and Arizona style materials for jewelry I don't know of any other store where you can find the selection of turquoise, coral, abalone, and other natural materials that is available at Al's.  They also stock a wide selection of stone as well as glass and crystal beads.  The staff is very helpful and knows the inventory.  If you are looking to match a piece of turquoise or a pendant with a particular color of turquoise, this is the place to do it.  Prices are reasonable and the quality is very good.

Any place that is willing to lose a customer by charging for condiments that likely cost less than 5 cents does not value its customers nor does it warrant your business.  Something is VERY wrong at Carl's Jr...  These are despicable buffoons who should not work with the public.  I hope that the owner is well invested in other ventures.  Business practices such as these do not promote and retain customers.  Do yourself a favor and look for more pleasant surroundings.  Yelp lists many good restaurants nearby that do not charge for condiments and who treat their customers like they're glad to see them.
