My husband and I had breakfast at La Grande Orange today. It was our first time and even though parking was difficult I had really high hopes going in. I read up on the reviews from my fellow yelpers out there--and was ready for the challenges that eating here brings. Even though I knew about the long lines and needing to find a table first--I still found it difficult to navigate through this place!   Once we got to the counter and we ordered, I was shocked that our bill was over $25. I had the oatmeal with an English muffin and he had the Daybreaker--egg white omelet--we each had OJ and that was it! I asked for a little side of cream and some butter for my oatmeal and it didn't come with our meal. When my husband politely asked for it--the gal at the counter showed little in the way of customer service skills and pretty much treated him as if she didn't have time to deal with his request--a common denominator from other yelpers as well.   My oatmeal was decent (although I've had better at Taylor's Cafe--costing about $2 less, much bigger portion and it comes with fresh blueberries, strawberries, banana's as well as cream, butter and brown sugar! :-). My husband's omelet was completely tastless--it was an egg white omelet with smoked turkey breast with avocado and tomato salsa. The tomato's were nice but the omelet had no flavor except for the salt from the turkey. If you're expecting cheese in your omelet--be sure to ask to have some added! It contains exactly what the ingredients lsited on the menu reads--no more, no less. The smoked turkey is your average sliced sandwich turkey meat on top of the egg white rolled up with the tomato's and scant avocado pieces tossed on top.   I'm so disappointed--maybe we just ordered the wrong things? When looking around we did see some delicious looking sandwiches and it did seem that people were enjoying their food, we were just wishing that we were enjoying ours as well. We finished quick and got outta there.   We'll probably give it one more shot some time down the road. We had the same reaction when we ate lunch at Chelsea's about 6 months ago. Not much in the way of portion for the price you pay. Knowing they're owned by the same company--it sure explains that taste and atmosphere didn't make up for the sticker shock.

I keep waffling between 2 and 3 stars--2.5 is appropriate. Banfield is to pets what Nextcare is to people. They're available when you can't get into your regular healthcare doc and will allow quick turnaround on service at a decent price.   The issue I'm having is their immediate upsell on tests and "extra's" and also when it comes to vaccinations and medication. In today's economy, I can't believe that Banfield would put such a hard sell for unnecessary items like they did with me on the last two visits. People don't have a lot on extra money to throw around--that's why they're coming to Banfield in the first place, right?   Our last visit my dog Fezzy had an eye infection and his vaccinations were due so I asked for a price quote. The first step was to upsell me on tests (allergy tests, skin tests, etc) and then also to upsell me on the vaccinations and give him more than just Rabies and Bordatella. There was a shot for parvo (seriously? thought that was just once when they were puppies) and one other disease I didn't remember.   After the vet examined Fezzy the tech came back and listed 5 medications for him, everything from an anitbiotic, an analgesic, an eye wash, an eye ointment and an allergy pill. Total bill was to be $465. I scrapped the vaccinations (can get them done at the Phx Spay/Neuter Clinic for much cheaper--$40) and all the extra tests--and when I was looking over the needed meds I noticed that the eye ointment was listed at $84.99! For a tube of triple antibiotic eye ointment. Essentially we're looking at spending $85 on a tube of neosporin. I was shocked! The tech said that the vet could give me a presricption for that one to take to my pharmacy if I felt it was too expensive. I immediately agreed.  I took the rest of the meds and with the appointment the total came to $105.   Here's the kicker--I called 1800PetMeds--the price for the ointment: $35.99 plus shipping--oh it gets better! I called CVS on 7th Street--$24.99 but they'd have to order it. It gets even better than this---So I dropped it off at CVS on 16th and Camelback and went to pick it up in the afternoon--price was $15.99! A whole $70 cheaper than Banfield! Can you believe that markup???   Staff was friendly--everything else was alright--just watch their pricing and look over the details of your bill. Ask the question--are these necessary and does my pet really have to have that? Oh---your regular pharmacy can fill almost all pet medications. Check with them first--you'll keep some of that hard earned money in your pocket!

Always great service and love the Summer $20 special. Sauce is one of the few places that serves Naked Snowqualmie Reisling--and it's delicious with a Chicken Pinenut Salad along side their pizza--ANY pizza, in fact. Our family eats here at least 1x each week--especially for our Wednesday Family Movie Night!

What's there possibly to say except this is one of Central Phx's best kept secrets!?!? Follow the directions our fellow Yelpers have listed for finding the place--they helped me and I'm so glad because we're regulars as a result.   Roasted Pernil pork, creamy jalapeno corn and a delicious glass of white sangria with pear--what's NOT to love?   The patio at dusk is delightful--and the live jazz music on Friday and Saturday evenings add to the delightful atmosphere. This is such an enjoyable experience--it's just very special at Fuego's. :D

Good gawd I've been waiting for a delightful place that will tantalize my senses and bring total gratification to my palate in a single meal! If you could see me in person you'd know I am an utter and complete foodie--I KNOW good food and The Parlor is off the charts!   The interior design is somewhat modernist but warm and inviting. The atmosphere lends itself to be a great place for friends and family to congregate and enjoy a great meal together.  We sat at the Pizza counter in incredibly comfortable stools that beckon you to kick back and enjoy the views! The chefs work with creative precision as pizza after pizza goes in and comes out of the wood-fired oven with ease. It's apparent that these guys really enjoy what they do--each pizza is made with loooove as they top them with various nuts, herbs, cheeses and oils before sending them out to the restaurant floor to be devoured.   With all there is on the menu to choose from; we stuck to a few salads (Heirloom Tomato & Artichoke Summer Squash--Both delightfully delicious! :-) and shared a mouth-watering Aged Cheddar burger that was epic! I am nuts over a burger that's juicy-drippy-cheesy goodness and this by far delivers! I tossed the bun aside and had it with just the fresh baby greens salad--it was to die for!   Then we were on to dessert--when one of the Chef's was out and about--stopped in to say hello and give us the rundown of what we could choose from. We went with the Chocolate Cake--and here's when you know you've got something good--time stood still as I moaned as I swallowed every bite of that incredibly moist, not-to-sweet scrumptious delight as it hit my tongue. I have died and gone to heaven--there is no cake (and I KNOW cake!) in this town that is as good (well at least that I've found) as this Chocolate Cake from The Parlor. If you haven't had it yet--let me tell you--they use only the best ingredients; their own house-made sour cream and Italian imported cherries--dark delicious cocoa powder--and even a little balsamic vinegar to enhance the flavor and assist in maintaining moisture! This cake melts in your mouth--better than butter! You get the picture!   To top it all off, one of the proprietor's (son--didn't catch his name--many apologies) had noticed that we were tuned into watching the kitchen action as if we were watching Iron Chef. He came over and intro'd himself and chatted with us about his vision and why he wanted to build a great restaurant. Niice. He's doing something right and you can see that just by looking around at the happy smiling faces that fill each and every table!   I could go on and on... but should stop for now.  If you couldn't tell--this is my new favorite place. Stop in and let me know if your visit is just as great as ours--I can't wait to hear about it!   Ciao! :-)

Best pedi I've had in a very long time! My hubby, BFF and I needed a good pedi--and since I was warn out on the salon we'd been going to--it had been a while and I was seriously tired of my tootsies not coming out to play!   Emily was my nail tech--she was absolutely fantastic. Took her time and was very meticulous even though it was late in the day and on 4th of July! My hubby and BFF both had a similar experience! Yes!   The ambiance is very spa-like--add the sugar scrub and hot stone massage and you'll be chillax'n in no time. Truth be told, I love this place! The test is on the next few visits--I'm hoping I've found our new home for my tootsies!

I once had a friend who dreamt of cheeseburgers. In fact, she described that in her dream she was standing in front of a hotel made out of a cheesburger! Drippy cheesy goodness made up the swaying curtains that pulled away from the windows. Each condiment represented a different floor of the building--and that it smelled like the bestest cheeseburger ever!   The day I ate a Culvers Double Butter Burger with Bacon, I knew exactly what she was saying! Buttery Delicious Goodness are the words that come to mind! And... after surviving on a 500 cal/day diet for 3 weeks I even admit to having dreamt of a cheeseburger to this caliber!   The custard is fab--the customer service is the best you'll see at a fast food place--its your down-home kinda joint--for every family to enjoy! Go in deep---and you'll come out smiling everytime at Culvers!!! :-)
