Went to Qdoba for lunch and there was a long line, which is to be expected around 12:30 on a workday. Didn't take too long to get up to the counter though. I ordered a burrito bowl with chicken, white rice, pinto beans, cheese, and a little sour cream. The girl behind the counter actually listened and didn't overdo the sour cream. Very much appreciated. They have the Coca Cola Freestyle machine, but I got iced tea. The drink station is kind of awkward with the placement of the lids and utensils. Not really a logical flow and feels congested. It was a nice day so we sat at a table outside. Lots of people eating around there. I very much enjoyed my burrito bowl. I think their chicken is so much better than Chipotle's. They really need a Qdoba on the west side in Avondale/Goodyear!

Stopped here on a road trip from Phoenix to Tucson. We just wanted some Original Unsweet Tea and they were out! There was plenty of sweet tea, pineapple papaya, and black mango, but no regular. :( So disappointed. We had to settle for Smart Water. Wish we hadn't missed the two QT's before this one.

This was my first time eating at Babbo's. I wasn't expecting it to be back in a shopping center. I guess I pictured it to be more like Carrabba's. The place was packed and very noisy! We waited about 15 minutes before being seated and then waited several more minutes before anyone came to take our drink order. Several minutes passed and someone else came to take our drink order. Hmmm... confusion. Even more time passed and I started to think about leaving to go somewhere else when our waters and bread finally came. I ordered the spaghetti & meatballs. The restaurant was so loud, it was like a roar. I couldn't hardly think in there. We were sitting next to a large party of women too so it was even worse. The service picked up in the second half. Our waiter let us know the food would be out soon and apologized for the wait. We got our food at the same time as a table that was seated long after us. The spaghetti was good, but it had a lot of sauce! I like sauce, but it was swimming. The meatballs were tasty, but nothing I can't get anywhere else. When the check came, I was surprised to see my meal was only $5.99! How can I complain about that? I guess they do a special on Mondays. Nevertheless, I don't think I'll be making the drive to come back here.

Made a reservation to meet some old friends at Mimi's for brunch on Sunday. I didn't go in with high hopes since they called us on Saturday saying we missed our reservation... (Told them it was supposed to be for Sunday and they fixed it.) They redeemed themselves after a nice brunch. My boyfriend and I each ordered a mimosa to try... a White Peach Mimosa and a Mixed Berry Mimosa. They were both delightful! For my breakfast I went with the Cinnamon Roll French Toast (CRFT), which came with 4 strips of bacon, 2 eggs (scrambled, well-done), and fruit. The french toast was very sweet (which is to be expected, since it really is a cinnamon roll) and the maple syrup was really unnecessary. I like sweet so I liked the CRFT, but there were two of them and there was no way I was eating more than one (sugar overload), so I took the other one home. I enjoyed the sides also (it was a lot of food) and our server was pretty good. I'll be coming back to Mimi's to try the Lemon Poppy Seed Waffles or the Quiche Lorraine!

Stopped in on our way back from Sedona for a couple slices of pie to go. Got the cherry crumb and blueberry. They were both tasty. The cherry was excellent! In the past I have tried banana cream, coconut cream, apple crumb, and peach. I have enjoyed all the pies so far, but banana cream is my favorite!

Went to Applebee's for a bite Sunday night. The music was loud and... interesting. Not quite like the Applebee's I'm used to. We decided to get an appetizer sampler (2 smaller portions for $10) with the Brew Pub Pretzels & Beer Cheese Dip and Mozzarella Sticks. My boyfriend also got a Maple Bacon Chicken Piadini (no lettuce and the maple mustard on the side, in case I wanted to share). Took a little while to get our food. I was afraid the appetizers would come out cold, but they were actually warm and my b/f's wrap and fries were basically room temperature. There were 2 long, skinny pretzels and 4 mozz stix. The wrap wasn't bad with some of the leftover marinara and cheese dip. We ordered dessert via the tabletop kiosk. We got 2 Dessert Shooters as well as the new Churro S'mores, which looked too interesting not to try. The churros were very skinny and should have been warmer. I liked the toasted marshmallows but was disappointed in the chocolate underneath. It was just chocolate syrup, not actual melted chocolate, and it wasn't even warm. Not my favorite. My Strawberry Cheesecake Shooter was decent and my b/f's Chocolate Mousse Shooter was very thick and rich. Our server was alright... he seemed a bit overwhelmed, even though it wasn't that busy. The pay function on the kiosk was disabled... What a gyp! Applebee's left a lot to be desired.

Really good meal tonight at Arby's. I got the Chicken Bacon & Swiss (without the honey mustard) and curly fries. Had to wait a few minutes but all the food came out hot & fresh. I was surprised to see the amount of fries that were in the small! Arby's was on point today.

Oh Arby's... we knew we were in for an experience when we saw a guy up at the counter getting his money back. He had come inside from the drive thru. Must be a new crew. I ordered the Chicken Bacon Swiss meal with no lettuce, tomato, or honey mustard. My boyfriend ordered the same combo, as is. Everything was correct on our receipt. When we got our food, my sandwich was plain like I wanted, but too plain. They forgot the bacon! My boyfriend's sandwich had honey mustard, but was missing lettuce, tomato, and bacon! They said they would remake our sandwiches. When we got our new sandwiches, my boyfriend's was correct, but mine had honey mustard! AH! They had to make me a 3rd sandwich. Unbelievable. How many wrong ways can you make a sandwich, Arby's?! At least the curly fries were good.

Went to McDonald's for a snack. Decided to try the new mozzarella sticks (2 sets of 3 for $2) and shared a large order of fries. The fries were good. The cheese sticks were OK... they really needed to be hotter. I've had far better.

This location is not closed. It has been recently remodeled. And I have to say it was probably the best Taco Bell I can remember eating. Everything was hot! What a concept! I just got a Combo Burrito with no sauce or onion and it was great. My boyfriend's food was equally good. And the fountain drinks were not watered down like every other Taco Bell. The Mountain Dew tasted as it should. I also liked the new dining area. Several seating options with cushy booths, high tops, and regular tables. Very impressive, Taco Bell. Keep it up!

Ordered a Double Decker Taco (no lettuce), Nachos Bell Grande (no tomato), and a drink. When our food came out, I saw that there was lettuce on my taco. Brought it back up to the counter. They said they'd make me a new one. When they set it down on the tray, I saw that it was a regular taco without lettuce. It was supposed to be a Double Decker. They said they'd remake it. Brought out a new one to our table along with cinnamon twists for the trouble. Unwrapped the taco to find that it had some kind of white sauce on it... No! It's supposed to be a Double Decker Taco with meat & cheese only! OMG. I was just laughing because we had 3 failed tacos sitting on the table. Unbelievable. Finally I got the right thing, but it took a little while because their drive thru got busy. Only then did I start to question whether my Nachos Bell Grande was actually the smaller Nachos Supreme, but at that point I didn't care. And for the umpteenth time I asked myself, "And these people want $15 an hour??"

We like coming to Waffle House for dinner because it's not crowded like it is for breakfast. Service is quick and doesn't take long to get your food. I ordered the waffle and hashbrowns topped (with chili) and covered (with cheese). They put a lot of chili on the hashbrowns! And it was tasty. The waffle was yummy too. It was fresh & hot with a distinct vanilla taste. Not much to complain about really.

Went to Wendy's for dinner tonight. This location is always freezing inside! I wish the fireplace actually put out heat. I ordered the 6 piece nuggets, Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger (plain), and had to try their new BBQ Pork Cheese Fries. You have a choice of sweet, smoky, or spicy sauce. I decided to try the sweet. Their Coca Cola Freestyle machines were out of a lot of flavors. Tables were dirty and needed to be wiped down. When the food came out, I was disappointed to see onions on the pork fries. I didn't realize it came with onions, so we had to scoop them off. Of course you can never get them all... There wasn't a lot of BBQ pork on the fries. The flavor was nothing special. I had a bite of my boyfriend's pork sandwich with the smoky sauce and I liked that sauce better. The sandwich was a whole lot more bread than pork though. Kinda sad really. My burger was simple but tasted good with the bacon. The nuggets were fine (actually got 7) but didn't really do it for me tonight. Should've gone for the spicy nuggets. There was a very long line of cars in the drive thru when we left!

My boyfriend & I have come to enjoy this place. I am not a salad eater, but I go for the soup, pasta, and baked goods. They are always rotating their menu items, so check their website before you go if you are hoping for a specific soup or bakery item. It's not a cheap buffet, but we have been getting coupons in the mail so those save us a few bucks. Today I had the Deep Kettle House Chili, focaccia (pizza), mac & cheese, Chicken Pipette & Vegetable soup, penne pasta, blueberry muffin, apple cinnamon muffin (gluten free), chocolate chip cookies, and soft serve. Carb overload! The focaccia was soft & cheesy and the muffin was tasty... didn't taste weird at all for being gluten free. The dining room attendant was good about coming by and refilling our waters, and even brought around fresh chocolate chip cookies, which I have not seen them do before. I was disappointed when she first came around because she skipped our table, but when we asked her about the cookies she went and got us some. And then brought us more from the next fresh batch! The chocolate chips were not as sweet as I'm used to (slightly bitter) and I thought the dough was more buttery than sugary. But I still enjoyed everything. I think they have good quality stuff, especially compared to Souper Salad. My biggest complaint is the layout. Everything is really close together which is especially problematic when it's busy.

My boyfriend had been talking about this "amazing" French toast he had at the Cheesecake Factory when he ate there with his family, so we finally made it over there for Sunday brunch. I ordered the Bruleed French Toast and he ordered the Farm Fresh Eggs, scrambled/well, with potatoes, toast, and bacon (meat is extra). We planned to share so we could have a little of everything. I was surprised that they brought out the complimentary bread before our brunch, but it was almost lunchtime. I sure do enjoy the honey oat bread. Sourdough is alright too. When our food came out, I took a bite of the French toast and was instantly turned off by the mushy consistency. It's so thick and, I'm sure, soaked in egg. It was not appetizing to me. My boyfriend offered to switch plates since he'd had it before and liked it, so we did. The eggs were fine and maybe had a little seasoning to them. Most of the potatoes were crunchy, so I was not impressed. The bacon was really dark red in color and very crispy. I don't know if that means it is extra lean?? The toast was really not necessary after all the bread I had just eaten... Overall I was not pleased with this meal, especially for the price! And I had a stomach ache afterwards. There are so many other places I'd prefer to get breakfast food. Our server did not really have a sense of humor either. We did get a couple slices of cheesecake to go, for good measure. Vanilla Bean and Lemon Meringue. Unfortunately the meringue had melted off the top by the time we got it home... The vanilla bean tasted a lot like vanilla ice cream. So it was good, but even half a slice was too much. The lemon meringue was rather tart but the whipped cream helped to balance it out. I've enjoyed other varieties of cheesecake more than these two.

I like 5 & Diner. I love the oldies music and their burgers are some of the best I've had. Always juicy and delicious. I ordered the Big Texan which has bbq sauce and an onion ring on Texas toast. It was yummy and very filling with all the fries. Mmm mm! Good lunch with my best friend. Their breakfast is good too. And don't forget about the milkshakes!

Stopped in to grab lunch on Christmas Eve. Got a hot dog with ketchup, mustard, and relish, and ordered a plain buttered pretzel with cheese from the kiosk at the Kitchen...I love that thing! The pretzel came with a free drink and I got a Cherry Limeade with crushed ice. QuikTrip is great. Where else can 2 people eat lunch for 6 bucks? And it was tasty. The only area I see for improvement would be the hot dog buns. They are nothing special. A pretzel bun would be awesome! :)

Came here after seeing how busy Matt's Big Breakfast was! Virtually no wait here. Got seated all the way in the back. My only complaint about that was the back wall has a long bench that multiple tables share, and there was a little girl next to us that kept getting up, sitting down, getting up, sitting down, so the slats on the bench kept moving. Pretty annoying. But they left before long and a new group sat down that remained pretty still. Our waitress was very friendly and spoke in a calm and happy tone. But she used some weird phrasing and kept making odd jokes. So I guess she was almost too friendly and we thought it was strange, but also entertaining. I ordered the Tri-Fecta with a waffle, scrambled eggs (well done), and bacon. The food came out quickly and everything tasted fresh. Eggs were cooked right. The waffle even came with a side of mixed berry compote that was good. I also tried some of the bacon & cheddar pancake my friend ordered with his meal. It was REALLY good! Savory and delicious. We ended up taking half of it home. If we make it back here, I'd like to try the Floridian french toast... it looked pretty good.

Had a good lunch at Panda yesterday. Most of the food looked pretty fresh and there was a wait on the teriyaki chicken, as there usually is. It's good stuff and they can't keep up with the demand! But for this visit I went with the Beijing Beef in a Panda Bowl with half fried rice, half chow mein. It was tasty. There was only one piece of meat that was tough to chew. But that bowl filled me up! Enjoyed the Panda Passion Tea as well. 3.5 rounds to 4.

The 3 closest Pandas to my house have been very inconsistent, so we decided to give this location a try. It wasn't any better. The workers here do not listen. The guy in front of us was ordering in Spanish. The lady scooped in half chow mein, half fried rice. I guess that wasn't right because she scooped the fried rice back into the pan. That was still wrong because she then dumped the chow mein back into the pan and gave him all fried rice. Weird. So then I ordered. Asked for fried rice and honey sesame chicken. She scoops the fried rice onto the plate and then takes my boyfriend's order. Then she asks me what entree. Honey sesame chicken! Ugh. My boyfriend got orange chicken and teriyaki chicken so we could share everything. Then I get up to the register. I ask for 2 small drinks. The cashier asks me what size. Small! She rings me up and hands me one cup. I asked for two! So we then had to pay for the second drink... We go to fill up our drinks and there is spillage all over the drink station. Sat down to eat. The honey sesame chicken was cold. The orange chicken was barely warm. The teriyaki chicken? It was great! Delicious meat, yummy sauce. That was the winner. The fried rice was also good. At times it has been undercooked/crunchy, but they did a good job today. The Panda Passion tea is very good too. Went to get refills before we left and they had made a pathetic attempt to wipe the spill but it still wasn't clean. All in all, no reason to go out of our way to eat at this location because it's just as inconsistent as the others.

This is a nice-looking building in a not-so-nice area. They have two Coca Cola Freestyle machines and a self-serve ICEE machine. Looked promising but we didn't see chicken fries on the menu, and never got a chance to ask because we stood there for about 5 minutes and no one bothered to greet us. So we left.

Yummy Olive Garden! I always enjoy their soup, breadsticks, and pasta dishes. Tonight I got the chicken parmigiana and pasta e fagioli. Everything was great. Our server was very soft spoken so it was hard to hear him, but he was still a good server so it was ok. He brought us Andes mints with my to go box, as well as with the check! Love those things! We also got a slice of pumpkin cheesecake to go. We have yet to eat it, but I'm sure it will be tasty. The biggest downfall of Olive Garden is it can be kind of noisy since there's usually a lot of people there with their families. Tonight there was a child screeching at the top of his/her lungs that we could hear from across the restaurant. But did the parents ever take him/her outside? No, of course not! Some people just don't give any thought to anyone else and it's unfortunate. I was told that the location on Bell Rd has little tablets at the tables that you can order/pay on now. Wish this one had those! I think that's totally awesome. *** UPDATE: I have to revise my review after heating up my leftovers. Something was wrong with the chicken parm... The meat was tough to cut and when I took a bite, I spit it out. It was inedible. I don't know what it was but it was nothing like the piece of chicken I ate for dinner. It was absolute junk... like processed tendons. I wish I had tried that piece when we were at the restaurant so I could have asked for a new one. So disappointing. Because of this, I have to drop the rating from 4 stars to 2.

Got lunch here a few weeks ago. Ordered the Sourdough Jack combo (no mayo or tomato) with regular fries. It was good. The dining area looked updated and clean. They have the Coca Cola Freestyle machine. Also had a couple of my dad's nuggets. They were so hot & fresh! Mmm Mm! Good stuff.

Ended up here on New Year's Eve since 5 & Diner closed at 3pm for the holiday... Johnny Rockets was closing at 6pm and we made it just in the nick of time! Grabbed a seat at the counter and ordered a 9" Rocket Dog (ketchup, mustard, relish) with fries. Enjoyed watching the cook hustle on the grill, as well as the signature smiley face ketchup bowls for the fries. The fries were really good! I also enjoyed the Texas Toast that the hot dog came on. A very tasty meal to end the year on.

I really enjoy California Pizza Kitchen and wish they had a location in the west valley! I like that their pizza crust is thin, yet soft. That's not an easy combination to find. Ate here for dinner last night and it wasn't very busy, but it was a little early so that may be why. I ordered the pepperoni pizza and my friend ordered the BBQ chicken pizza without onions and added bacon. We shared for a little variety. They were very tasty! The crust on the BBQ chicken was a little darker and not as soft so they must have cooked it a little long, but the sauce was smoky and delicious and I enjoyed it. The pepperoni was yummy. Service was good but he forgot about our drinks for a little while, although he tried to make up for it towards the end. I was happy overall. Please open a restaurant in Avondale/Goodyear!

I had not eaten at this particular Panda until now. The guy behind the counter confused me a little bit because he looked at me like he was ready to take my order, but then started talking to another person behind the counter. Then I started to say what I wanted, but I still didn't have his full attention. Hmph! Had to start giving my order about 3 times before he was ready to listen. The chow mein looked a little sad but I was getting fried rice so it was okay. The mixed veggies were also sad-looking but the guy was nice enough to ask my boyfriend if he wanted fresh vegetables (he did). A lot of the food actually looked fresh... particularly the honey sesame chicken and sweet fire chicken. But I was getting the teriyaki chicken which is pretty much always fresh. They packed my Panda Bowl with fried rice and teriyaki chicken! Impressive. I noticed the sign saying their ice maker was broken so we made the decision to take our food to go so we could split a large Panda Passion tea and put our own ice cubes in it. My Panda Bowl was still hot when we got home. And it was good! The rice was cooked well and the chicken tasted fresh & delicious. Best Panda we've had in awhile. Maybe next time they will have ice and we can dine in. :)

I wanted a Breadbowl Pasta and decided on pepperoni, beef, and cheese with extra marinara sauce. Also got a medium thin crust cheese pizza, and my boyfriend wanted the chicken parm sandwich and the BBQ Bacon Specialty Chicken. They had a deal for $5.99 each! I didn't follow the Pizza Tracker very closely, but our food seemed to arrive quickly and the delivery guy was friendly. The food was great! I loved everything. The Breadbowl Pasta and the thin crust were on point. The chicken was also very good. We haven't ordered Dominos in awhile but we may need to start again because that was really good.

I was dropping off a prescription at the nearby Walgreens drive-thru and looked over and saw Domino's. Sounded like a good choice for dinner so my other half placed our order on his phone. I wanted the Breadbowl Pasta with pepperoni, shredded provolone, and shredded parmesan. When the Pizza Tracker said it was ready, we went inside to eat since they have tables and I had to wait for my prescription. The guy said it would be 5 more minutes because they had to remake my b/f's sandwich (I guess they burned it or something?). We sat and ate our other food in the meantime. The Breadbowl Pasta hit the spot. The BBQ Bacon Chicken is yummy too. And the tables were very clean since people don't normally dine in. :)

It's been a long time since we've ordered from Pizza Hut, but I wanted to try the new Twisted Crust Pizza so I ordered a large, half pepperoni/half cheese with all marinara dipping sauce, and an order of 8 Sweet Chili Boneless Wings. The confirmation said approximately 1 hour for delivery! Holy cow! It took almost the full hour too. But I thought the pizza was very good. The garlic crust tears off easily for dipping. The wings were very tasty too! We'll have to add Pizza Hut back into our pizza rotation.

Love QuikTrip. I've had their hot dogs and other rollers, but decided to try the bratwurst this time with some ketchup, mustard, and relish. It was good! Paired it with a Mountain Dew. Great afternoon lunch/snack! The people behind the counter are always friendly.

Been coming here for almost 5 years now. Everyone is always so nice which makes it about as pleasant as a dentist visit can be. My hygienist was gentle & considerate during today's cleaning. Dr. Lee is a friendly fellow. I would recommend Wigwam Creek Dental to anyone looking for a dentist in the west valley.

I usually go to the Walgreens on 107th & Indian School, but I had just left Urgent Care with my prescriptions and thought this location would be more convenient. What a mistake! There was a long line at the pharmacy and I was standing there with flu symptoms (fever, chills, body aches) waiting as patiently as I could. When I finally got up to the counter, the pharmacy tech asked if it was OK that my prescriptions would be ready at 11AM the next day. I don't think so! Time is of the essence with Tamiflu... He told me they are backed up and suggested going to 107th & Indian School. I knew I should've gone there in the first place! I felt so miserable and just wanted my flu medication... I started crying as we walked out of the store. Never coming back to this Walgreens for anything.

Wanted a breakfast sandwich from Jack this evening and the other JIB locations in the area haven't had the best track record with me, so we decided to try this one. I didn't even know it was there! Doesn't look like much on the outside and the parking lot is kind of awkward. But we had a good meal and the girl at the counter was nice. I had the supreme croissant with curly fries. Also had some of my boyfriend's regular fries and they were really good too. This JIB location didn't disappoint.

I love Bobby Q! The food is delicious. We went tonight, knowing it would be busy, and waited over 40 min to be seated at a high top table in the bar. We had a great server who was very friendly and attentive. Got our waters quickly, followed by the delicious cornbread. I usually order the pulled pork, but this time I decided to get the pulled bbq chicken sandwich with mac & cheese. Didn't take long to get our food. Requested the regular BBQ sauce. The food was good, especially the mac & cheese which is very rich and yummy. Was interesting to see some vapor coming in from a fog machine in the adjacent club. I like the moist towelettes they give you to clean your hands after the meal. And perhaps the best part? The mini donuts! Our server even brought us some extra and offered to get us waters to go. The donuts were hot and scrumptious. Mmm mm! I think they raised their prices since the last time we came, but it's still a good value. Be prepared to leave full and happy.

I have not been a big fan of PF Chang's in the past, but this was probably the best experience I've had at one of their restaurants. A friend treated me to lunch and I had the Citrus Spice hot tea, some Crispy Green Beans, a Vegetable Spring Roll, and the Crispy Honey Chicken with white rice. The tea was very good. I like the little kettle and teacup they bring out to you. The crispy green beans were decent. The breading is very plain... it isn't seasoned like TGI Friday's, but I guess that's why they give you the spicy dipping sauce (which I didn't try). The spring roll was good, but I had to pick out the chopped up mushrooms. Made a small mess trying to pour the little cup of sweet chili sauce... a spoon would have been smart. The honey chicken was tasty and the rice was also good. I usually expect Chinese rice to be dry and flaky, but it was actually good. My only real complaint is that when our server divvied up the food into take out containers, we didn't get any rice. If I had been paying closer attention, I would have asked for some. Oh well. Good PF Chang's meal overall.

Decided to go to Claim Jumper for dinner. Had not been here in a long time! I enjoyed the garlic cheese bread. It was warm, soft, and tasty. I ordered the rotisserie chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans instead of roasted vegetables, as well as the potato cheddar soup. Everything was very flavorful! They do not shy away from seasoning here. The soup was cheesy with chunks of potato and seemed to have a garlic/onion powder flavor. There were also little crunchy french fried potatoes on top. The chicken was tasty, the mashed potatoes were VERY buttery, and the green beans had like a mesquite seasoning. I liked them a lot! And they were well-cooked... not too crunchy. My boyfriend ordered a slice of pumpkin cream cheese pie to go. It was HUGE! But I know most of their desserts are giant... Six-layer chocolate motherlode cake, anyone? We also had good service. Nice meal overall, and I have leftovers for tomorrow!

Valle Luna has always been one of my favorite restaurants. We get buy one, get one free coupons in the mail so we try to go once a month. We met my parents there for lunch today and they were pretty busy. They sat us back in the Cortez area where I have never sat before in all my years of coming here. It was a little noisy back there but once the family with the kids next to us left, it was a lot quieter. Our table was a little wobbly (pet peeve) and I thought it smelled a little strange in there... like cleaning products? I'd rather smell fajitas. But the chips & salsa were good as always, and I ordered my usual: two chicken enchiladas with rice & beans and no garnish. The food was delicious as always, although there were a lot more onions inside than normal. Took one enchilada home with me to eat the next day. Service was good up until the end, it took her awhile to bring us the check. But overall, a good meal. I wish there was a Valle Luna in the west valley!

Excellent visit to Valle Luna Friday night. The parking lot was completely full, but we managed to grab a spot in the front as someone was leaving. The hostess told us 10-15 min, but we only waited about 5. They removed the big take-out counter in the waiting area and put in more seating since we were last here, so it seems a bit more roomy. They also took a lot of the pictures/plaques down. The chips were really good! Tasted fresh and delicious. I got the chicken chimi (no garnish or guac) with rice and beans. It was awesome! Also had a few of my boyfriend's steak nachos... so yummy. Used our buy-one-get-one coupon. Got iced teas to go. Kayla was a very good server. My only problem with this meal was that I ate too much!

Got a coupon for my birthday and we had to use it! My friend and I ordered the chicken chimi with rice and beans, and a half order of steak nachos to share. Everything was delicious! Enjoyed the chips and salsa, as always, and service was good. Valle Luna has redeemed itself as my favorite Mexican place!

Went to Buffalo Wild Wings on Monday. Wasn't as busy as I thought it would be with the different sports on TV. But I go for boneless wings, not to watch games. They had brand new menus! You could tell they had never been used before. The Italian burger caught my eye right away. It had mozzarella sticks, marinara, and pepperoni! Red Robin once had a burger like that called the Wise Guy and it was delicious. But I digest... I came for boneless wings and I was getting boneless wings. The menus now say small/medium/large instead of the actual number of wings... kind of annoying. We got the medium size which was 18 wings and got 3 sauces: honey bbq, lemon pepper (dry rub), and teriyaki. We also got the potato wedges with cheese and bacon. Everything was good. They put a lot of bacon on top of the wedges! Those wedges are so tasty and are great with just cheese. Really the only bad part about the meal was when we got a box for our leftover wings and forgot to grab it when we left! I was so mad. 6 perfectly good wings gone to waste... :'(

Ended up here after going to the location on Bell Rd and there was a 45 min wait... on a Tuesday! Yes, it was Senior Night, but that was surprising to me. Maybe everyone is in town for Thanksgiving? Or for the winter (snowbirds)? The wait at Cave Creek ended up being about 20 min. Not bad. The food was pretty consistent with our regular location. The chips were a little oilier than I'm used to, but the chicken chimi (no guac or garnish), rice, and beans were very tasty. In fact, I think the rice was not as dry as the Bell location has been. Got to use our buy one, get one free coupon. I still wish there was a Valle Luna in the west valley! Once a month we drive 24 miles each way to eat at Valle Luna. Would love to have an Avondale/Goodyear location!

My other half & I decided to give Esplanade another try after not returning for quite some time. In the beginning, we thought it was really cool to have dinner while watching a movie in fancy reclining seats with no kids around, but then after multiple foodservice experiences that really distracted from the movie, it became more trouble than it was worth. But it had been awhile so we decided to give it another go and went to see The Jungle Book at Fork & Screen. When we arrived, our theater was still being cleaned so we were unable to go in until about 10-15 minutes before the movie started. The menu was different. Seemed like fewer options to choose from. I was considering the Southwest Chicken Bowl and asked our server if it was possible to get white rice instead of brown. He wasn't sure and when he pulled it up on his tablet, the Southwest Chicken wasn't even available. So I went with a plain Cheeseburger & fries. My other half was smart and ordered 4 waters for the 2 of us so we wouldn't have to push the button and wait for refills during the movie. My burger patty was so well done, it was crunchy. Just thin & dry, no juiciness to it at all. I used to get burgers here and I don't remember them being like that... The fries were pretty boring, a little salty. I used to enjoy their parmesan fries. While I did enjoy the movie, the meal was a disappointment and does not make me want to return.

Did Grocery Pickup here. I think it was the first time everything was actually in stock so no substitutions or refunds were necessary. Nice! The lady who brought out our groceries was very nice & we also got some freebies for being new customers. Love this service!

I love Wienerschnitzel! I usually prefer the Angus All Beef dogs, unless the regular dog has chili & cheese on it. And their french fries are so good! I don't know what it is about them, but I like them a lot. Today I got the Angus Chili Cheese dog on a pretzel bun. It was tasty. Fries were delicious as always... hot & fresh. I didn't get anything from the tastee freeze this time, but their stuff is really good. I just wish there was a location closer to my house!

We seemed to arrive with the dinner rush! Lots of other people were getting there around the same time. I ordered the all beef mustard dog and chili cheese fries. I was disappointed because the fries are usually my favorite but they were undercooked! I should have sent them back cuz they really weren't good. The chili and cheese couldn't even save them. My hot dog was good with some ketchup and relish. But the fries made me sad. Not my favorite visit to Wienerschnitzel.

Great meal at Wienerschnitzel. I decided to try their corn dog for the first time, as well as a classic chili cheese dog, and shared a large order of fries with my boyfriend. The corn dog was great! So much better than the ones at the state fair that have way too much batter... Gross. But this one was crisp on the outside and the frank inside didn't even taste junky (like a Sonic corn dog). Chili dog was delish and the fries did not disappoint. Mmm mm!

I had a 12 o'clock appointment to have my hair curled for my birthday. When I got there, the girl at the desk (not very friendly and didn't look like she wanted to be there) said the stylist would be right with me. There were several customers getting their hair done. About 10 minutes passed and the girl called me back to the desk and mumbled that the stylist was really behind and wouldn't be able to do my hair. She mumbled that they might be able to do it later or tomorrow... Uhh no, I have an event at 4pm! She just kept looking down at the schedule and said sorry. I had a moment of panic, but left and called another salon that was able to style my hair within the hour. I really didn't appreciate the bored attitude of this person or the fact that no one bothered to call me in advance to let me know they were behind. Totally unprofessional.

Met a friend for dinner here the week of Christmas. It wasn't very busy at all so I guess everyone was out shopping. I ordered the three-cheese chicken penne with no tomatoes. The pasta wasn't very hot when it came out. There also wasn't a lot of chicken on it, which was fine with me, but others might find it to be skimpy. It tasted alright and I ended up eating it all... should have taken some for leftovers as the sauce is heavy. The garlic bread that came with it was not very good... it wasn't warm and tasted borderline stale. They really need to serve better garlic bread. We also got the chocolate chip cookie sundae for dessert. It was pretty good. But overall, not my favorite meal.

Ordered the Teriyaki Burger combo with no lettuce, tomato, or mayo. Waited a while for our food and they brought it out to our table. When I unwrapped my sandwich, it had everything on it that I didn't want. So I had to take it back up to the counter and wait for someone to acknowledge me so I could tell them it was wrong. Had to wait awhile longer to get my new sandwich. Ate fries while I waited. They were ok, not super fresh. The burger came out as I asked, however there were onions on it which I was not sure about when I ordered, but those were easy to pull off. The burger was quite tasty with the pineapple and teriyaki sauce. Ran out of napkins at our table and had to steal some from another table. Overall, could have been better.

Went through the drive-thru for a late night snack. I got a Cheesy Potato Burrito. It was piping hot and still warm by the time I got home. It was tasty. Nice job, Taco Bell!

Went to Subway for a quick lunch. There was one person in front of me but she was ordering multiple sandwiches so it was taking a long time. And there was only one guy working the counter. Finally someone else came out to help me after some more customers had lined up. I ordered a 6" turkey & ham on flatbread. White or wheat? White. Wheat? White! She had to go in the back to get it and then said she would warm it up... Had it toasted with some American cheese, mustard, pickles, salt & pepper. An oatmeal raisin and an M&M cookie with a Sprite and I was on my way. My sandwich was very disappointing. The flatbread was soft but almost had a stale aftertaste. And I'm again reminded that their cold cuts are of low quality. If there were a Firehouse Subs, Jimmy John's, or Jersey Mike's closer I'd never have a reason to go to Subway... it's just not good.

This was the strangest Carl's Jr. experience ever. I ordered my usual Western Bacon Cheeseburger, small combo. The guy at the counter was clearly new and needed help entering our order into the register, which I don't fault them for. That's totally fine. At least it got entered in right. They had to tender cash at a different register for some reason. We got our number, got some iced tea, and sat down at a table. An employee walks over to our table holding a bag and asked if we had the Western Bacon Cheeseburger... yes. She realized it was supposed to be dine-in and went back to put the food on a tray. When she brought it back, we noticed we were missing an order of fries and a chicken soft taco. She went back to get them. The fries that we did get were a medium instead of a small and they looked pale/undercooked. When my friend unwrapped his sandwich, he found it was a double cheeseburger instead of a chicken sandwich... He took it back up to the counter and they gave him the correct sandwich. Although he found it had ranch on it even though he asked for no mayo/sauce. Then when he went to unwrap the chicken soft taco, it was actually a bean burrito! He had to take that back too. They told us we could keep the burrito. My burger was fine, though I always wish they warmed the bun. The fries were lousy. I wanted to take them back and ask for fries that were hotter and cooked longer, but I didn't think they could handle it, given their track record for the evening. But by this point we were just laughing at how wrong everything had gone. During our meal, we could hear the shift manager, who was bagging orders, yelling at the staff. From our perspective, it looked like the shift manager was the one screwing everything up. We observed other people's orders getting messed up too. It was crazy! I don't think I've ever had a meal anywhere that was that screwed up. Get your act together, Carl's Jr.

Ordered Papa John's for lunch yesterday. Two medium one topping pizzas for $15. We got pepperoni and a 3-cheese blend. I think it was about 30 minutes for delivery (although it felt longer). Pizza was delicious! Hot, soft crust, melty cheese. Yum! Great leftovers too.

Totally digging the new Walmart Grocery pickup. We do our shopping online the night before and pick it up the next day. It's totally stress free! You don't have to deal with other shoppers or wait in line while all your frozen items thaw out... They bring your groceries out to your car, organized and ready to go! If they are out of something you ordered, they will substitute it with another item for the same price or give you a refund. We love this service! And it's free (for now).

Haven't been to Red Robin since they changed the the design of their logo. I figured there would be some changes to their menu as well. There was, but not only that, the inside of the restaurant was redesigned too. The lighting was better and seemed nicer. The menu was spiral-bound with more items and lots of pictures. Something new that caught our eye right away, but we did not order, was the tower of donuts (Doh! Rings). After being greeted by 3 different people, one of whom was the manager who gave us each a rewards card, we got our waters and ordered the O-Ring Shorty (6 rings instead of 13) to start. I think RR onion rings are some of the best, although I thought these left a distinct fried oil aftertaste. Don't know if they have always been like that, but I noticed it this time. My favorite burgers there are the Whiskey River BBQ burger, Banzai burger, and Royal Red Robin. But the Smoke & Pepper burger caught my attention... "Topped with black-pepper bacon and extra-sharp Cheddar on a toasted ciabatta bun with house-made Smoke & Pepper ketchup." Yummy! No lettuce and no pink, of course. My boyfriend upgraded his steak fries to their new Garlic Herbed Fries. When the food came out, I noticed pepper jack cheese, onion straws, and an onion bun... not my burger! The server was new and apparently confused the Smoke & Pepper with the Peppercorn burger. The manager told me they were fixing it and would comp my meal. Very nice of him! He also brought out a basket of steak fries while I waited for my burger. The fries were hot and tasty. I wasn't overly impressed with the garlic fries as they just had a garlic salt and not actual minced garlic like the ones we got at the State Fair a couple weeks ago. When my actual burger came out, it had lettuce (no big deal, easy to remove), it was cooked properly, and it was good! Very peppery, so if you like pepper like I do, this is a great choice! Took half of it home to eat for lunch the next day. The server also gave us some extra fries with our boxes. :) While the service was a bit scattered, the mix-up was rectified so I am happy with our RR experience.

We usually sit in the bar area, but service has been hit or miss there so we opted for the dining room. Our table was one that is just inches from another table on either side so there is absolutely no semblance of privacy and you can hear your neighbors' entire conversations. I hated it. We should've asked to move... but we stayed. I ordered the Royal Red Robin. No lettuce, tomato, or mayo with no pink and the egg fried hard. The little tray they serve the napkins and silverware on had some ketchup on it so it dirtied one of the napkins. Gross. We had to ask for a new one. My burger was very good, but my b/f requested the peppercorn sauce for his on the side, which he got, but they also put it on the burger... He mentioned it to the waitress and she said she wrote down "on the side" so she didn't know why they put it on... and she halfheartedly asked if he wanted them to remake it, but reluctantly he said it was okay. Also the fries weren't super fresh. And a few of them tasted like dirt, even in the second basket. Get it together, Red Robin! At least we got buy one, get one 50% off...

Treated my mom to lunch here on Mother's Day. It was her first time having Chipotle. I got a bowl with white rice, black beans, barbacoa, cheese, and sour cream on the side (so I could put on the amount I wanted). It was very tasty. My mom really enjoyed her bowl with chicken. Very nice, simple lunch.

Love going to Golden Corral. They have such a large selection of food choices and most of the items I've tried have been very good. Some of my favorites are the starches: mac & cheese, made-from-scratch mashed potatoes, and yeast rolls. I used to really enjoy the pot roast, but now I'm hooked on the meatloaf. Some of the other things I ate: pulled pork, pinto beans, mini corn dog, steak fries, and baked pasta. All pretty good. And of course I got dessert! A chocolate/vanilla soft serve cone and jello. Some new things... they now have hand dipped ice cream: rainbow sherbet, cookies & cream, butter pecan, and strawberry. But they only had strawberries, marshmallows, and a couple burnt, pumpkin-shaped sugar cookies to dip in the chocolate fountain. They used to have macaroons and rice crispy treats! Not sure if they were just out or not carrying them anymore. One thing I would like to see there is cherry cheesecake. They've had cheesecake before, but it was always warm (room temperature). Not appetizing--cheesecake ought to be cold! The place is usually busy and drink service is hit-and-miss, but our server last night was decent keeping our waters refilled. If you want to overindulge and are prepared to navigate the buffet with many overweight people and less-than-considerate kids, it's a good place to go eat!

Went to Golden Corral on Easter. Waited in line for about 15 minutes or so. There were plenty of tables available when we were seated. Everything was pretty good as usual, but they ran out of sweet corn pudding and it was never replaced, so I couldn't get any. That is one of the items I always look forward to at GC, so it was very disappointing. Also, the chocolate fountain only had strawberries and marshmallows for dipping. No cookies or rice krispy treats or anything. What a letdown! I wanted my $13.99 back.

Went to The Place for breakfast and was shocked to find that there was no wait! There are always people waiting outside on Sunday morning. Not sure if we were just early or if people are still eating leftover turkey. We got seated right away and I ordered the Waffle Breakfast with scrambled eggs (well done) and bacon. It took quite awhile to get our food, considering they weren't very busy. But when it finally came out, it was fresh and hot. The eggs were cooked correctly as always and the waffle was perfect. I also tried some of my friend's chorizo quesadilla and diced potatoes. So tasty! Aside from the long wait for the food, it was a great breakfast.

Returned to the fair this year. We were smart this time and brought our camelpaks so we could stay hydrated and not have to spend a lot of money on drinks. The day we went it was overcast and breezy most of the day but the sun came out periodically. We were prepared and wore sunscreen. It was Saturday so we were able to take the free shuttle from the capitol and it was before 2pm so admission was only $2. Good deal. We ate our way around the fairgrounds. Started simple with a Dodger Dog: a long/skinny hot dog with ketchup, mustard, relish. Nothing special but good for an appetizer. Then we got a frybread with beans, chili meat, and cheese. It was so good! Really enjoyed that. I had never tried a deep fried Twinkie before so we got one of those in sundae form. It was difficult to eat the way they cut the Twinkie in half and stacked it in a plastic cup. Not easy to cut through with a plastic spoon while standing. It was OK. Tasted like a donut. I think deep fried Oreos are probably better. Then we got Cowboy Fries: fries with BBQ tri-tip and cheese (and a Coke). They were delicious! Probably my favorite thing we had there. Then we finished off with the Minneapple Pie with vanilla ice cream. Very yummy. We spent $50.50 in food & drink for the two of us. Didn't do any rides or games this time, but we enjoyed seeing the kangaroo at the petting zoo (my b/f refers to him as Rosco) and clocked about 7 miles on Map My Hike in about 4.5 hrs. It was a pretty good day!

It's been a long time since I've eaten at Aunt Chilada's. I get out to the east side very infrequently, but we were in the area and decided to stop in for lunch. I liked the pond with the ducks out front. When we first walked in, I was hit with the smell of toilet water, like the floors had been mopped with dirty water. Not very appetizing. Fortunately the hostess walked us out across the patio to a different building. It smelled more like food over there so that was a good sign. After we were seated, we waited for quite some time before anyone came to greet us, take our drink order, or bring chips & salsa. We were actually contemplating leaving right before our server walked by and said she'd be right with us. When she came to get our drink order, we also ordered our food since we'd had plenty of time to decide. I went with the chicken enchilada, black beans, and rice. The bowl of chips and bowl of salsa were huge. That was different. The first couple of chips I had were underwhelming because they were cold, but then I got to some warm chips that tasted much fresher. It's a very noticeable difference. The food came out rather quickly, which was surprising considering how long it took to be acknowledged in the beginning. I enjoyed the rice & black beans. The chicken in my enchilada reminded me of canned chicken. It really didn't have a lot of flavor. The enchilada relied on the red sauce for taste and I wasn't very impressed. Also our last water refills tasted odd, like it shared a spout with some variety of lemonade that got mixed in with the water. Not good. But I'm glad I had a chance to remind myself what Aunt Chilada's food is like. I see no need to drive out to the east valley to eat here again.

A friend suggested meeting here for lunch on Saturday so we gave it a try. The place was a ghost town! Hardly anybody in there or in the general vicinity. Kinda felt like the zombie apocalypse a little bit. But I guess they are busiest during the week for lunch and happy hour. I liked how they kept a glass bottle full of water on the table so we could refill our drinks. I ordered the Backyard Burger (bacon, cheese, BBQ sauce) with fries. I figured since we were practically the only people in there that our food would come out somewhat quickly, but it still took awhile. The food was good though. You could see the seasoning on the fries and I was afraid it would be too much, but they were actually good. I enjoyed my burger too. Definitely a quiet environment (aside from the poppy music) to chat and catch up around that time. Also, you can park in the garage and they validate your parking. Maybe I will try Sunday brunch one day...

Great lunch at Honey Baked Ham Cafe. I ordered the Ham & Turkey Deli Stack (with swiss & cheddar on a European white roll, no lettuce, tomato, or honey mustard). I also made it a combo with the baked beans. We thought their iced tea tasted weird (earthy?) so I got root beer instead. The sandwich was delicious. Their meats are always fresh and yummy. The bread was soft and good. The beans are very good as well. The meal also came with a pickle. It was more than enough food and I couldn't finish it all. The cafe was quiet which is a nice alternative to many of the places we eat.

I have not had In-N-Out for a long time. I never understood the hype. But I decided it was time to give it another try to remind myself why I wasn't crazy about it. I don't like the standard toppings on their burgers, so I got a plain cheeseburger. I never cared much for their fries so I just split an order with my friend. The fries were so oily that I could not have eaten more than half without feeling sick to my stomach. And I like grease! There is just something about them that doesn't jive with me. The burger was okay, but I would rather go somewhere that I actually like the fries (Five Guys, Culver's, Smashburger, Freddy's, even Wendy's). Sorry In-N-Out fans! I just don't get it.

Panda is always hit or miss, but this visit was a hit! The fried rice and teriyaki chicken were hot and fresh. And we just beat the lunch rush! As we were eating, the people flooded in and there was a line to the door. The workers really had to hustle. I just realized we didn't get fortune cookies, but that's alright. It was a tasty meal.

In the past I have gotten the Maui burger, but this time I went with the Mavericks burger (well done)... BBQ sauce, crispy onion straws, cheese, and pickles. No lettuce/tomato/mayo for me! :) It was very good, and the fries were amazing. They taste like homemade with the skins on. I just wished there were more of them! But it was actually enough food and I was full. This place is always good.

I enjoy BJ's Brewhouse. They have a lot of variety and the quality of food is very good. We got an email promoting their Pumpkin Pizookie, so we had to try it. Their pizookies are so good... cookies n cream is my favorite! They are always busy for dinner and it was Friday night so I thought call ahead seating was a good idea. When we arrived, there were tons of people waiting outside, so I was glad we called ahead. The hostess told me it'd be about 10-15 min... not bad. Less than 5 minutes later, we were seated! I was amazed. I think we got in quick because there were large parties waiting and a two person booth opened up for us. Sweet! The restaurant was full and noisy. Lots of people there with babies. I was happy that they seated us in the central part of the restaurant. Whenever we sit on the north end we always have bad service. I was planning to order a burger, but I ended up choosing one of their "Enlightened Entrees": Maui Glazed Pork Chop with oven roasted red potatoes and green beans. Not something I would typically order but it sounded right. When it came out, it was a sensible amount of food. A lot of their entrees are almost a full day's worth of calories so you almost have to plan to eat half and take the rest home. The pork chop was good. Had a sweet glaze with a little kick in the chili pepper flakes. The potatoes were fine but would have been better with some butter & sour cream, or even ketchup. A little difficult to swallow without a gulp of water. Wasn't a big fan of the green beans. Too firm for my liking and needed some more flavor. But I traded a few for some of my boyfriend's asparagus, which I liked better. Then for the main event... Pumpkin Pizookie! It was delicious. Seriously. Go get one. :) I also recommend their handcrafted root beer & black cherry soda, which I didn't get this time, but they are good!

Met a group of former coworkers for dinner and had one of the best meals I've had at BJ's. My boyfriend and I ordered the sliders with cheese & bacon along with the carnitas fries w/ chile verde. The mini burgers were so juicy and delicious! The carnitas fries were so flavorful. They use the shoestring fries but there was one wedge cut fry in there too and it was very tasty! My only complaint was they had onions on top and I didn't know that when ordering, so we had to scoop them off. We had the same server as last time and he did a great job, with the exception of our waters going dry during dessert. We got the Pizookie trio with pumpkin, cookies & cream, and chocolate chunk! Really good meal. 4.5 stars rounds to 5!

A coworker brought me here for lunch on Friday. They were busy and we had to park in the neighborhood around the corner. I ordered the 1/2 sandwich (Smokey Joe with only turkey, bacon, and gouda) and Chicken Tortilla soup. It took awhile to get our food... surprising considering the simple items we ordered. But when we did get it, it was tasty. Good flavors in both the sandwich and the soup. I just had to eat around the tomato chunks. I'd like to come back and try the baked goods (muffins) and maybe breakfast.

I have been coming to Massage Envy for years, but earlier this year I finally decided to get a membership. I have been to several different locations and most of my therapists have been pretty good, but I hadn't found the one I wanted to be my regular. Then I got Zack at Park West. He is amazing! He really listens and knows just what to focus on to relieve my tension/stress/pain. I always look forward to my monthly massages!

Came here for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. We've done the teppanyaki many times so we decided to just eat in the dining room since it would be quicker and easier (especially with the couples there for prom). A guy came and took our drink order (water and a Blue Hawaiian) and then disappeared for awhile. Then a female server came to take our drink order and we told her the guy had already been by. She seemed very confused but then the guy returned with our drinks. He ended up being our server for the duration of our meal. We decided to order an appetizer off the happy hour menu. $3 spring rolls. I had to laugh when they came out because it was two spring rolls cut lengthwise so it looked like four. They were tasty though. For my entree, I ordered the Steak & Chicken with no vegetables or soup. Our server asked if I wanted more rice in place of the veggies. Yes, please! Fried rice, of course. The food was very tasty! There did not appear to be any onions in the rice, which was appreciated. The steak was very tender and delicious dipped in the teriyaki sauce! The chicken was fine too. Oh yeah, and the Blue Hawaiian is still the best drink I've had anywhere. Very expensive meal, but it was a special occasion and I had leftovers to take home.

Finally decided to try Tortas Paquime. I did not realize how much business this place does. All of the tables inside were occupied when we arrived and there was a steady flow of people the whole time we were there. I ordered the twin burritos (1 green chile beef and 1 shredded pork with no guac), as well as the super nachos with carne asada (guac on the side) to share with my boyfriend. The twin burritos look like four because they are cut in half on the plate, but they are skinny so it's manageable. I really liked the green chile beef. The shredded pork was ok, but I wasn't a fan of whatever smoky spices are used in the meat. I added some salsa verde to help out the flavor. The nachos were great! Yummy meat, nacho cheese, and beans with sour cream on tortilla chips. Mmm mm! Simple and delicious. This little restaurant also has Mexican pastries and ice cream. I'm pretty sure we'll be back.

This review is for the hair salon. I had an appointment with a different salon to have my hair curled for my birthday, but they got really behind and couldn't keep my appointment. I called Ulta and they were able to get me in within the hour. They truly saved the day! Vivian was very friendly and did a great job styling my hair. Ulta came to the rescue and made my hair pretty for a very memorable evening! I am so grateful!

Made a reservation for 10 to celebrate my 30th birthday. Felt like VIPs when we pulled up in our super stretch limo! This was my 2nd time dining here so I knew it would be good. It was Saturday night and they were busy. Our table was all the way in the back. After our server explained how everything worked and took our drink order, we made our way to the salad & sides bar. There I found scalloped potatoes, red potatoes, rice & beans, and some imported cheese (I skipped the veggies). Some delicious warm cheese bread was brought to our table. Before long, several folks from my party were ready for meat and flipped their cards to the green side. It's like they opened the flood gates! Several servers rushed over, one after the next, to offer a variety of meats. Their plates filled quickly. They also brought out polenta (fried cornmeal), garlic mashed potatoes (which don't taste like garlic), and delicious caramelized bananas. By the time I was ready for meat and flipped my card over, the service had slowed. It's like I missed the window! So I had to wait a bit to be served. I ended up with filet mignon, bacon-wrapped chicken, bacon-wrapped steak, sausage, and parmesan pork. Everything was yummy! My only complaint was that everyone was seated so close to one another that we had to lean off to one side so the servers could come between us to serve the meat. Kind of annoying. During the meal, I decided I wanted to order a pina colada, but our waiter was nowhere to be found. He really abandoned us for awhile. My sister and her husband went over to the bar to get drinks. Eventually someone came over so we could order drinks. Once I finally got the pina colada, it was delicious. As we were finishing our meal, a dessert menu was placed in front of me and I was told I could choose a complimentary dessert for my birthday! I was full, but I couldn't pass on a free dessert. I was surprised to see how many choices there were! But I had to go with the strawberry cheesecake. They brought it out with a candle and "happy birthday" written in strawberry sauce. The slice was huge too! I took a bite and passed it around the table so everyone could try it. It was so good! I think it made two full rounds before it was gone. It was a VERY expensive meal, although the coupon I had received for my birthday helped a little bit. I enjoyed my birthday dinner and I think this is a great place to go for a special occasion.

Got the applewood bacon & cheddar egg sandwich on a plain bagel, but they forgot to heat it up... I noticed the cheese wasn't melted when they handed it to me, but when I sat down, I touched the bacon and it was cold like it was right out of the fridge! No way I was eating that, so I went back up to the counter to get a proper sandwich. They said they would warm it up. They did, and it was fine, but I don't understand why they didn't do it right the first time...

I love Golden Corral and usually go to the location on Dysart but decided to give this one a try. What a mistake! I was expecting a large population of Hispanics, considering the area, but I was not expecting the mass of people coming to eat here Sunday afternoon in their church attire. The place was packed. There weren't even that many people at Dysart Golden Corral on Thanksgiving Day! I immediately felt my anxiety rise. Once seated, my friend and I had to take a moment to mentally prepare before attempting to navigate the buffet... It was so crowded. I got meatloaf, mashed potatoes, steak fries, pot roast, and a yeast roll. The meatloaf is one of my new favorite things at GC, but I noticed it looked different. It had a gravy on top instead of the ketchup I'm used to. And when I tried it, it was cold and gross. Definitely a different recipe. I couldn't eat it. And I did not get the mac & cheese I usually love because it looked like it was still frozen... my friend said it was cold. What a disappointment! The dessert bar was a nightmare to navigate. I couldn't get anywhere near the chocolate fountain. People just crowd around there and cut in line. It's awful. The dessert bar was also slim pickins... there wasn't as much selection as there normally is and what they did have was running low. The workers couldn't seem to restock quickly enough. Speaking of workers, they kept blocking the aisles and we couldn't get to & from our table easily. This location sucks and I don't ever need to come here again.

Enjoyed the chocolate fair this year. It was busy, but we were pleased to find it wasn't as crowded as last year. Brought our root beer mugs from last time and got 2 root beer floats for $2! Awesome! The guy who helped us was very upbeat too which is always nice to see. Got a free sample of the cheese curds next door. Made the rounds and got a free sample from Nothing Bundt Cakes... it was the chocolate turtle. Very moist and tasty. Of all the food choices I was surprised to find there wasn't any pizza... only the chocolate pizza, which is not worth it. They are $10 and tiny. Wanted to get something non-sweet and decided on the garlic fries. Wanted bottled water too but they ran out. The fries were decent. Large stack with tons of minced garlic. Tried another vendor for bottled water but they were out too... Who runs out of bottled water?! That was a big strike. We noticed San Francisco Chocolate was drawing the largest crowd and realized it was probably because they were the only vendor selling the frozen cheesecake. Other stands had the chocolate strawberries, bananas, and apples, but no cheesecake. I figured we'd take the shuttle bus over to the Cerreta's factory and see if they had cheesecake over there. It was a nice, short ride and it wasn't crowded over there at all. And the tent outside had cheesecake! And bottled water! Went in to buy some french mints to take home... I love those things. I'm always tempted to get the strawberries, but 5 for $15 is a racket. Got the cheesecake and had our pick of tables there to sit down and enjoy. Rode the shuttle bus back to find the whole place lit up! All the trees had festive lights and it looked really cool. I had never been to Glendale Glitters but I guess they left the lights up for the chocolate fair. Although parking was $10 and the Sears people kept bothering us to sign up for their shopping spree, we still had a good time.

I have been under the weather and wanted soup. To Olive Garden we go! I was excited to see that they have the little tablets on the tables now so you can order drinks, appetizers, and pay on them too. Had some weird mishaps from the start. I ordered a peach tea and when our server brought it out, my friend noticed the glass was dirty. So our server said he'd bring me another one. When he came back, he accidentally brought a pink lemonade or something. So he went back again to get the correct drink. I was disappointed that there were no frozen peaches in the bottom... did they stop doing that? That was the best part, eating the peaches at the end. :( When I took a sip, it was almost warm and quite syrupy. Needed more ice. My friend gave me most of the ice cubes from his water. The server did come by and ask if we wanted more ice. I said yes, but he forgot to bring it... Oh well. I ordered the soup (minestrone) & breadsticks, no salad. We also ordered the risotto bites as an appetizer, which the server entered into the tablet for us (I would have rather done it myself). The girl at the table next to us was texting the whole time, with the sound on so we had to hear the stupid chime... The people who eat here are always so oblivious to others around them. My soup and my friend's salad came out before the risotto bites. Considering the soup was my entree, I thought he would bring it out with my friend's entree. Guess not. The breadsticks were fresh and garlicky so that was good. And the risotto bites were yummy as usual. Breaded cheesy rice balls served with marinara. Genius! When I was getting low on my soup, our server asked if I'd like another bowl. I said yes, and he brought it out right away. Wasn't even done with the first one... Over eager server! Better than a neglectful one but still... My first bite of the second bowl of soup was surprisingly salty! I was taken aback! It had to have been from a different pot than the first... it wasn't bad enough to send back, but it was noticeably salty. :( When a guy came by with a pitcher of peach tea, I still didn't see any peaches in there... We had a gift card and were able to pay with that on the kiosk. It even prints out your receipt, which is nice. We were going to do the survey, but it timed out without warning. Pfft! But our server brought us 6 Andes mints so that was appreciated. Rocky visit, but I know we'll be back.

It was Friday night and I was expecting a long wait, but it was only about 12 minutes. I decided on the Never Ending Pasta Bowl with Rigatoni and Alfredo to start with soup (Pasta e Fagioli). Our soup, salad, and breadsticks came out very quickly. The breadsticks were different than normal. They looked and tasted like they were soaked in butter and the garlic salt was excessive. Don't know what was going on there. My soup was very good. The pasta came out hot and was al dente. It was really good! When I was about halfway done our server asked if I wanted a refill. Yep! Angel Hair with Chicken Pomodoro was my second choice. It was a small bowl and I was able to finish it all. Swiped my card on the kiosk and we were on our way. We didn't get any Andes mints though... =\

Enjoyed breakfast for dinner one day last week. It was pretty quiet evening there. I got the VIB with a cheese omelette, bacon, french toast, and country potatoes. Everything was really good. Our server was nice and friendly, which is kind of a rarity. The manager even came by to see how everything was. Got to use our $5 off coupon. Very good meal.

Was on the hunt for tamales and wanted to give Carolina's a try. It was a Saturday afternoon and the place was packed! There were people waiting for tables. I ordered a red beef tamale and a green corn tamale. My friend got the combo with a red beef and their "special" green chicken tamale, which the cashier said was "really good." We waited a long time to get our food. When it finally did come out, I was shocked to see how small they were! Holy cow. Not only that, but they were mostly masa... hardly any meat inside. What a disappointment! I'll go back for mini chimis, but tamales? Never again!

Best Carolina's visit ever. I got my usual beef mini chimis (no guac or garnish) and sour cream on the side. For once, the rice & beans were actually hot! And the chimis were delicious. I would have given 5 stars but the iced tea tasted a little funky.

I enjoy CiCi's Pizza. They don't have the highest quality pizza or anything, but it's all-you-can-eat and when you get it fresh, it's good! And their desserts are scrumptious. They've got cinnamon rolls, Bavarian dessert pizza, apple dessert pizza, and brownies. For the pizza I tend to stick with pepperoni and cheese varieties. Sometimes they don't put sauce on them so I like to dip in marinara sauce. The thin crust pepperoni is one of the best. Today they also had cheesy (not just garlic) breadsticks and mac & cheese alongside the marinara and alfredo sauces. It was a very weak cheese sauce and cold though. The unsweetened iced tea was very good today. You can also request specialty pizzas and my boyfriend asked for a BBQ pizza and I asked for a mac & cheese pizza. They brought us whole "individual" sized pizzas! We were only able to eat half of each and didn't want to waste the leftovers. I figured since you can buy pizzas to go there, we asked if we could pay to take our pizza home. They allowed it for a minimal charge. :)

Decided to try this place for the breakfast burritos. They are served all day, which is nice. There was a long line of cars in the drive thru, but we went in to eat. My boyfriend & I ordered a bacon burrito and a steak & egg burrito so we could try both. They were huge! We only ate half of each and took the other halves home to eat later. Very hot and delicious. The tortillas were fresh and yummy. We also ordered some fries just because. They were a little dark and had a crunchy exterior, almost like they were battered but I think they were just left in too long and/or maybe they used old oil. So the fries were nothing special, but it's a Mexican place so not a big deal. The iced tea was on point today. Would definitely go back for the breakfast burritos and maybe try some other menu items.

I felt like rice & beans so I thought of trying Federico's since we had only had their breakfast burritos before. I went with the Green Chile plate which came with a big flour tortilla. I assumed it was beef but I honestly couldn't tell what kind of meat it was since it was swimming in green chile sauce. It was tasty though. And I really liked the rice & beans. Very filling plate!

Since Panda Express is still substituting corn in their fried rice due to the egg shortage (not cool), we were on the hunt for a suitable alternative. The food at Rice Garden inside Basha's did not look fresh and Chop Chop apparently closed, so we ended up at Pei Wei. I went with the Orange Peel Chicken (with fried rice, of course). I quite enjoyed it, although the snap peas were too crunchy for my liking and I had to pick out the red peppers and scallions. They had mandarin orange green iced tea, which was really tasty. Pei Wei will have to be added back in rotation, especially until Panda puts an end to the corn substitution.

We tried to order food online for us and our out-of-town guests, but Pei Wei's online ordering was down and we couldn't even view the menu on their website. So we just went. They were very busy with other people ordering takeout. I selected the Sweet & Sour Chicken (steamed) with fried rice. They said 15-20 minutes. I waited outside with my dogs, but my b/f said one of the workers was very rude to him. When we got the food home, I liked the sweet & sour chicken, but the fried rice was obviously made with brown rice! What the heck?! We just ate Pei Wei a month or so ago and it wasn't that way. Did they change their recipe recently? Or was that a mistake? I tolerated the brown rice, but I wasn't happy about it... Also, two people tried the sauce for the lettuce wraps and said that it tasted rancid. Gross! I think we'll stick with Panda after that experience.

Ordered online here for the first time. I got a barbacoa burrito with white rice, black beans, cheese, and sour cream. I put in the comments: "easy on the sour cream". Also ordered a burrito bowl for my roommate (half chicken, half steak... I didn't know you could do that!) who also requested a side of dressing & sour cream. The site said it would be ready in 30 minutes. I arrived right on time and the line was to the door. I went straight to the register and told the girl I had an online order. I had already paid online, she handed me the bag of food with my drink cup, and I was on my way! The order was actually correct too. The only thing that wasn't exactly right is our names were switched when they wrote on the foil, but that is easily forgiven. The food tasted great and I definitely recommend the online ordering!

I had planned to get a barbacoa bowl with pinto beans. What I ended up with was mostly black beans because they were out of pinto beans and some very fatty barbacoa. Not their best work. On top of that, every time someone went in or out, the door got stuck wide open and the cold air would blow into the already chilly dining room. A few of us got up to close the door several times. We saw a Chipotle employee walk by the open door more than once and didn't bother to close it. And these people want $15/hr.

Instead of the usual barbacoa or carnitas, I decided to try something different for my bowl and got the steak. Bad choice! Half the pieces were so full of gristle & tough to chew that I had to spit them out. The flavor wasn't even that great... Very disappointing!

Wanted to try something new here and did the "build your own burger" with a fried egg, bacon, and American cheese on an egg bun (and Smash fries, of course). My burger was excellent! So yummy. Still pricey, especially with the Premium toppings, but it was great.

Wanted the Teriyaki Burger. The guy at the register informed me they were out of pineapple and asked if that was okay. Nope! He asked if it was really that good because he hasn't tried it but everyone was getting upset about the pineapple. I wasn't upset, but the pineapple does complete the teriyaki burger. So I went with my usual Western Bacon Cheeseburger combo with the new Fresh Baked bun. I might add the place smelled like a bakery, which was pretty awesome. When our food came out, my burger was on the regular sesame seed bun. Just as my b/f started to get up to take it back, the cashier brought over the correct one. So at least he remedied the error quickly. And the Fresh Baked bun was great. But I still have to wonder why these fast food workers think they deserve $15 an hour...

Came here to get breakfast for dinner one night this week. I knew right away our server was overeager cuz she asked what we wanted to drink before we were fully seated. Then when she brought our waters she asked if we were ready to order. Um, no! Hold your horses, lady. But it's still better than being abandoned. Ultimately decided on the Moons Over My Hammy with hashbrowns. So yummy! Tried some of my friend's banana bread french toast. It was good, very sweet. More like banana cake. It had a cream cheese icing, which wasn't in the picture. But a good meal overall.

Worst Denny's experience in a long time. I ordered the Blueberry Pancake Breakfast with scrambled eggs (well done), hashbrowns, and bacon. It took a VERY long time to get our food. And there were only a handful of other diners there so I don't understand what took so long. When the food finally came out, there was butter on my blueberry pancake (I thought they did whipped cream on blueberry) and it was so melted and soaked into the pancake... We asked our server (young guy with arm tattoos that said "God's Gift") for another pancake without butter because we thought it came with whipped cream. He came back with two regular pancakes and a can of whipped cream. Are those regular pancakes? I wanted a new blueberry pancake! Moron. So I just said forget it and he took the regular pancakes away. The blueberry pancakes both had one side that was really crunchy. I have never seen that before and wondered how it was possible. It occurred to me that they must freeze the pancakes and maybe they got freezer burned on one side. I think that's the only explanation for the texture. Surprising, because I always thought they made them fresh. Also, the eggs were SO yellow! I have no idea what would make the eggs that bright yellow. Butter? They tasted normal, but wow. The bacon was the saddest bacon I've seen in awhile. Tiny, discolored, and mangled. And the hashbrowns were so oily, I lost my appetite halfway through. We were waiting for our check and our server hadn't returned after the pancake debacle. So I said let's just go up to the register to pay. We told the cashier we hadn't gotten our check yet. She tried to pull it up but said our server hadn't entered it yet. What? Really? So she stopped our server and asked him to enter our ticket. He went off to serve other tables as we stood there waiting. And waiting. And waiting. He wasn't coming back. The girl at the register got fed up and decided to enter it herself so we could pay and leave. What the hell, man?! It's like we offended our server by rejecting the pancakes and his feelings were so hurt that he chose not to help us anymore. So bizarre... We'll be frequenting an alternate location in the future.

Had a good dinner at Wingstop tonight. They were pretty busy, but we didn't have to wait very long to get our food. My boyfriend & I ordered 20 boneless wings (Lemon Pepper, BBQ, Teriyaki, and Hawaiian) and unseasoned fries to share. The lemon pepper were my favorite, followed by the Hawaiian... they have a sweet, pineapple flavor. Their fries are really awesome WITHOUT seasoning. I really dislike their seasoning. It tastes like a sugar/salt mixture and I think it's weird. Unseasoned is where it's at. I love natural-cut fries with the skin on and these were hot & fresh. One thing Wingstop needs is better forks. Their plastic utensils aren't sharp/sturdy enough to effectively stab the chicken. Also the unsweetened iced tea was a bit strong today. But overall, a really good meal.

Ordered online: 15 boneless wings (BBQ & Teriyaki), 4 of the new Crispy Tenders (Lemon Pepper), large fries (unseasoned), and 2 rolls. The Lemon Pepper Tenders were delicious! I liked them even more than the boneless wings. I may just get those from now on...

Some co-workers wanted to order Mexican for lunch and passed around a menu for Picosito. I decided on the green chicken enchiladas (no lettuce, tomato, onion) with rice and beans. After the order was placed, I was informed that there was no green sauce so it would be red... Not my favorite, but okay. When my food arrived and I opened the Styrofoam container, there were some chunks of melted cheese that looked like curds. Kinda grossed me out and I promptly scooped them off. After reheating my food in the microwave, I tried the enchiladas. I didn't like the red sauce at all. Had kind of a smoky flavor that I didn't care for. The chicken wasn't shredded as advertised, but instead diced/chopped. The rice tasted so plain, it might have well been white rice. Was not impressed with the beans either. Very disappointed with this lunch and I won't be ordering from here again.

Had a good lunch at NYPD Pizza. Had to try their new fried mozzarella. They were actually square shaped. I've never seen that before. They fell apart a little bit as we ate them because they are hand breaded and the juices were leaking out onto our hands. But they were good with the marinara. Not really seasoned, just simple. Pricey though... $7.99 for 3 squares! We ordered a medium 16" pizza with half pepperoni, half cheese. I liked that the crust was thin, yet soft. Sprinkled on some parmesan & oregano for added flavor. Good pizza. Our server was attentive and kept our drinks refilled. A $30 lunch for two isn't cheap, but we enjoyed it and had leftovers to take home, so I'm happy.

Stopped in for a bite while out running errands. We were confused because the guy inside was already putting chairs up on the tables and it was only 7ish (they close at 10). There were only two people ahead of us and it was taking forever! I was literally a second from walking out when Eric finally decided to help us. I got the 6" sweet onion chicken teriyaki on Italian bread with Swiss cheese. I didn't feel like toasted bread, so he just heated up the chicken for me. These guys were so slow making sandwiches... After paying and getting our drinks, we sat down at one of the high top tables, since all the other chairs were up. Right when we started to eat, the two employees went outside to smoke, leaving the store completely unattended. We were amazed. The chicken in my sub was not the best quality and I had to spit out some inedible pieces. Also there was a static-y speaker playing Jingle Bell Rock cutting in and out. Very annoying. We were finished eating by the time the two employees came back in from their smoke break. So irresponsible. Then they proceeded to empty all three tea dispensers like they were getting ready to close up shop. It was only 7:30! I bet they were planning to close the store early. These guys ought to be fired.

I go to Chick-Fil-A once every 1-2 months. I typically order the chicken sandwich, but for this visit I decided to get nuggets. My 8 piece actually had 9, which was a nice bonus. They were warm, but not fresh out of the fryer as they usually are. The waffle fries were fresh and tasty. Good unsweetened iced tea. I'd give it 3.5 stars (rounds to 4).

It was my first visit to Mill Ave and we spotted this small batch-made from scratch ice cream shop. Had to try it! They had some very interesting flavors to choose from. I asked to sample the banana crème pie ice cream and it was a winner. I got that mixed with some graham cracker crumbs. Super tasty. My other half went with the lemon poppyseed muffin ice cream. So good! This place was great. My only complaint: their spoons had sharp edges so I had to eat my ice cream very carefully so as not to cut myself! Maybe they do that to encourage people to get waffle cones? Fix that & you'll be golden!

The ice cream here is awesome and the service is great. The workers are always friendly and are happy to let you try samples of the ice cream. They have some standard flavors and have different specialty flavors each time we visit. Today they had one called "Manners" which was vanilla ice cream with fudge, chocolate crunch, fudge brownies, and chocolate chip cookies. It was yummy so I got a single scoop with half Manners and half Grasshopper (mint with GS cookies). We had a Groupon so it was buy one, get one free. They have punch cards too so after 10 scoops, you get one free. They also have yummy shaved ice, which I haven't had in awhile since I got hooked on the ice cream. Their ice cream is very cold & thick and takes awhile to melt. The only reason this visit wasn't 5 stars is because the chair and floor at the only vacant table was dirty so my boyfriend couldn't sit down. I know they were busy though, and a guy did come over to wipe the table off when we got up to leave. We live over 15 miles away, but it's worth the drive and we will definitely be back!

Another great experience at Scooptacular. Got one scoop with half Pumpkin King and half Cookie Monster. Both flavors were delicious. The employees were friendly as always! Enjoyed our ice cream on a bench out front so my dogs could join us.

A friend told me about this place long ago but it's 25 miles away, so I was waiting for a reason to go out that way. After seeing the good Yelp reviews and checking out their website, we finally decided to make the drive. It really is a hole in the wall that you probably wouldn't notice if you didn't know it was there. We actually drove past it and had to turn around to get back to it. The building is rather dark outside at night. But once inside, you fill up your drink first, then order at the counter, then pay. I got iced tea and a pulled pork sandwich with mac & cheese and beans. The staff was very friendly and the manager even comped our drinks since it was our first time. That was nice! It doesn't look like there's anywhere to sit and eat but you walk down the hall and there's a big dining area in the back. There were 4 different kinds of sauces on the tables. A sweet, a smoky, a spicy, and a mustard. I went with a combo of sweet & smoky. I liked it! I also tried some brisket from my b/f's sampler and it was really tender and good. The sides were also good, but could have been warmer. When my b/f went back to order more waffle fries (which were tasty) the manager asked how everything was and he mentioned the temperature of the sides. He said the water must be low and they would correct it. So it seems they genuinely want customer feedback to help put out quality food. That is appreciated. They also have BBQ Bowls and a BBQ Burrito on their menu which is different. We'll be back!

Ordered a 6" meatball on Italian bread, toasted, with provolone cheese, parmesan & oregano. The first guy behind the counter didn't look happy to be there, but I moved down the line quickly. Got a couple chocolate chip cookies and iced tea. Used my $10 gift card and still had some left over for next time. Woohoo! My subbie was hot & tasty and I wolfed it down. Good Subway experience.

Stopped in just to split an order of fries. This was the dirtiest Five Guys I've ever been to. I'm hoping they just had a big rush before we got there and hadn't had a chance to clean up yet. There was trash all over the floor, tables dirty and in disarray... the fries were good, as expected, although they didn't dump that many extra into the bag like the other Five Guys establishments I'm used to. And to be consistent with my general complaint about Five Guys, the music was too loud. They are capable of better.

I am done with this Fry's location. It is always so busy! Even at hours you wouldn't expect. Cars all over the parking lot and people all over the store, clogging up the aisles and stressing me out... And now the store seems to be playing religious/inspirational music. It's awful. I used to come here because it's the closest grocery store to my house, but I will do my grocery shopping elsewhere from now on.

Went for lunch yesterday and got the Chicken & Beef Teriyaki bowl (lunch special with a drink). It was yummy! It's cool how perfectly arranged the meat is on top of the rice. Good teriyaki sauce! Also tried some of the new garlic noodles that my boyfriend ordered and they were tasty too. Yogi's has the Coca Cola Freestyle machine now, which is always nice to have, although I just had iced tea. The place was clean. I've been here a couple times before but this visit was the best.

Went to Dunkin for breakfast. Ordered the bacon, egg, and cheese bagel with hashbrowns, iced tea, and a glazed donut. Got our donuts right away, then the iced teas, then the hot food. But they forgot the hash browns so my friend had to go back up to get them. I was underwhelmed with the sandwich because it wasn't piping hot and the egg had a powdery consistency... I don't remember them being that way in the past. Very odd. The hash browns were hot and had a good seasoning. They only give you like 6 though. The tea was really good. Very smooth. The donut tasted a bit plastic-y to me... Would like to try some other menu items, like the chocolate croissant.

I've learned my lesson. Do not come here when it's not busy! Like 8:30 on a Tuesday night. The food had obviously been sitting out for awhile and most things were cold and unappetizing. They didn't even have someone behind the counter doing the Mongolian BBQ... :( Very sad.

I had heard about Don Pancho from a co-worker and have been wanting to try it since seeing the positive ratings on Yelp. We finally gave it a try last week. We were welcomed with a friendly greeting and the guy asked if it was our first time and kindly explained several of the menu items to us. It was very nice. I went with the chicken enchiladas (no garnish) with rice and beans. We also got complimentary chips (which came with beans on top) and tried some of the different options from the salsa bar. It was a pretty good appetizer. I enjoyed my meal, although the beans seemed very watery. Definitely want to come back and try the mini chimis and breakfast burritos!

This Firehouse was busy! And it was between lunch and dinner so I was surprised. I got the Hook & Ladder Light, plain. They were out of unsweetened iced tea and I had to let them know. Took a little bit before the tea was ready and I could make my way back up to the drink station (lots of people), but it's always good food at Firehouse.

Came here for a chili dog after discovering Johnny Rockets doesn't have hot dogs on their menu (even though the website says they do). There were a lot of people eating at Freddy's. I got the chili cheese dog combo with no onions. It was pretty good on the Texas toast. I also had a bite of my boyfriend's BBQ Bacon Steakburger on Pretzel Bun and it was tasty. I like their shoestring fries. When you eat one or two at a time, it takes a while to get through them. Decided to get a mini chocolate shake as a treat after a rough day. It was very thick, smooth, and chocolatey. The perfect little size! One thing that I don't like about Freddy's is how the drink station is directly behind the order line so it feels kind of crowded.

This review is solely based on the (mini) Chocolate Brownie Delight Sundae. It's hard to put something that amazing into words. Smooth, rich, and decadent. It was like heaven in my mouth. And I'm not even a huge chocolate person. But it was delicious. I also tried the mini Dirt n' Worms Sundae, which was yummy too, but the Chocolate Brownie... OMG. So good! Try it, you'll love it.

This is my favorite Chinese place I've tried in the West Valley so far. Had a craving for chicken fried rice so I ordered online and went to pick it up 15 min later. It was greasy and delicious with large pieces of chicken and lots of egg. The only thing I don't like about the fried rice is the sprouts... just personal preference but I prefer not to have crunchy things in my rice. The other food I've had there in the past has been very good too, although the regular fried rice you can get as a side is a little disappointing... just plain with some egg. Would like some vegetables in there too. But still the best Chinese I've found on this side of town.

This was my first time at Genghis Grill and it was a unique experience. The place is bigger than I thought it was. You can either go up to the counter and build your own bowl, have them make your custom bowl, or choose a classic bowl. We wanted to make our own, but first ordered both appetizers: Garlic-Citrus Edamame and Chicken Potstickers. I thought the edamame was a little too firm for my liking and the seasoning was ok, but not amazing. The potstickers were fine but they were almost room temperature and the dipping sauce was cold, which I didn't like. And our water tasted like dirt! I'm not even exaggerating. I took one sip and that was it. My boyfriend agreed it was terrible. The cups looked dirty too. We promptly ordered a Coke and an iced tea using the cool little electronic tablet on the table. After the appetizers, we went up to make our entrees. There were several people in the line. I got the sliced beef with garlic, salt, and pepper, carrots, and pineapple. When I got toward the end, I realized the noodles were separate and did not have to fit in the metal bowl, so I decided to go back to the start of the line to add more meat and veggies. I got more of the same, plus a few green beans, broccoli, and mandarin oranges. I also got the Island Teriyaki sauce, an egg, and selected the udon noodles. When I got back to the table to wait for the food to be delivered, I noticed they had taken our tablet away... I was disappointed cuz I thought we would actually be able to pay with it. Boo. My boyfriend's food came several minutes before mine since he didn't go back like I did. I think it confused the workers that our food wasn't together. But once I got mine, it was pretty tasty. The beef tasted like hamburger meat, which I wasn't expecting, but I like hamburger so that's alright with me. Since it's stir fry, the green beans and broccoli were crunchier than I prefer, but they still tasted good in the sauce. I also tried a bite of my boyfriend's dish. He had chicken and the 3G sauce. It didn't have a lot of flavor because he made the mistake of putting the sauce in the bowl rather than in a separate cup, so a lot of it burned off during cooking. But the regular size was a good amount of food and I was full. I wish they had the option of doing two mini-bowls so I could try two different sauces and one w/ rice, one w/ noodles. That would be cool. I don't know if I will be back to try something different. Our server was very attentive, but it wasn't a cheap meal, and with the mishaps we encountered, I'm just not sure if it's worth it to return.

I don't eat sushi but my other half recommended Kokoro for their fried rice. So we went with a friend on my birthday. I ordered the pork fried rice and they both ordered rice bowls. My food came out first. The rice had very good flavor, however it was overcooked. It had some crunchy bits. Their fried rice also has corn, which I could do without, and green beans, which is different but I don't mind. A lot of time had passed and my fellow diners still hadn't received their rice bowls. My b/f went up to check on it. They said it was 8 minutes for the rice. What the heck is taking so long? Others who arrived after us had gotten their food... It was at least 30 minutes between the time I got my food and when they got theirs. That's just crazy. It's not like we were on separate tickets. We were all together on one ticket. I don't understand why they couldn't time it better so our food came out together. I tried some of the teriyaki chicken and it was very good. Before we left, I saw someone else's fried rice and it looked normal, not dark like mine. So a pretty disappointing experience overall, but I feel like I need to eat here again so I can try the fried rice as it's supposed to be. It had potential.

I never look forward to parking at this Subway because it's right by the Harkins movie theater and it's often busy. But since it's a weeknight there were plenty of spots open. There was only one customer in there and she was leaving so we didn't have to wait. I asked for a 6 inch Subway Melt on flatbread. When he asked me what kind of cheese I looked down and saw roast beef instead of bacon. I told him I wanted the Melt not the Club. He fixed it promptly. The guy also didn't overdo the mustard and pickles as they often do. Took my sandwich, M&M cookie, and iced tea to go. When I got home the sandwich was still warm and the flatbread was soft. Good cookie too!

I love frybread. It's been awhile since we'd eaten here because whenever we think of it, they're not open! (They are closed on Monday and by 8pm Tuesday-Friday.) But we made it back. I got the Frybread "Lil Vincie" which has meat & potatoes and cheese. I wanted it without the pico but was told that it is premixed, so I knew I'd have some onions and things to pick out. They were busy and we grabbed the last table. It takes some time for the food to come out, but it's so good. I really liked the meat & potatoes. We also got the dessert sampler (powdered sugar, cinnamon brown sugar, powdered sugar & honey, and honey). It was so tasty. Yummy frybread!

Wanted Jimmy John's today and we went! I got my usual: Slim 4 (Turkey) with cheese & bacon and Thinny Chips. I think they may have been training someone new because they usually have my sandwich ready by the time I get my drink, but today they didn't have that same sense of urgency. And the cashier accidentally rang up "add tuna" instead of bacon, but they still made it right. They put like 6 strips of bacon on it! It was a good sandwich. I think it would be even better if the french bread was warm. I like the Thinny Chips better than the regular ones. Not so oily and very yummy! The iced tea was good too. I didn't see anyone wiping tables and they needed to. Slightly annoyed that I live just outside the delivery zone for multiple JJ's... I'd give this visit 3.5 stars (rounds to 4).

Had lunch at Tropical Smoothie Cafe. I got the Honey Ham & Swiss Flatbread (plain) and a Hawaiian Breeze smoothie. There were a lot of people in there, but most cleared out shortly after we got our food. The flatbread is simple, yet effective. Warm and soft, with that grilled taste, sweet honey ham, and cheese. It's a good sandwich! The smoothie (pineapple, orange, and non-fat yogurt) was also good, although I think my favorite is still the Jetty Punch (strawberry banana). P.S. Their smoothies are big! When we were leaving I noticed a sign that says they're now open 24 hours. What?? Why?? Who craves smoothies at 2am? I certainly haven't. And they don't even have a drive thru, so what's the point? I just think of it as a lunch place so it confused me a bit. But they do have some quality stuff!

I wanted to try this location as I had been to the one in Goodyear once before and it was decent. Ordered online and picked it up on my way home from work. Waited an extra 10 minutes after the pickup time, but that wasn't a big deal. Got the Teriyaki Chicken, Orange Beef, Vegetable Fried Rice, and Wonton Soup. It was a ton of food! I weighed it when I got home... over 5 pounds. At first I thought they gave me sesame chicken instead of teriyaki because it had sesame seeds on top, but when I removed the lid, I saw it wasn't breaded and that it was teriyaki after all. I did not like the chicken... it had a weird consistency... not like any chicken I'm used to. I'm not sure how to describe it, but it wasn't normal. The orange beef was decent, but there were a couple bites I had to spit out due to bone and gristle. The fried rice was pretty good, but the sesame oil flavor was very prevalent. The wontons in the soup were fine, but I didn't really like the flavor of the broth. And then I discovered there were shrimp at the bottom of the container. Yuck! I didn't know the wonton soup had shrimp! That's enough to make me lose my appetite...

I wanted to try a new Mexican place and the reviews here were good so we gave it a go. When we pulled up it did not look like the most inviting place. There were no cars in the parking lot. Is it open? It was. When we walked in, all of the booths along one side had been pulled out and a young lady was cleaning the wall. The floor didn't appear to be in the best shape either... Mexican music was playing and it was a little loud. We walked over toward the food and saw some really good looking meats behind the window counter. It was tough deciding what to get! The girl who was cleaning the wall came over to ring up our order. She did not seem happy to be there and wasn't very friendly. My boyfriend ordered carne asada fries for us to share and I got the 3 rolled tacos combo (beef only, I could not mix & match with chicken) w/ rice & beans. They don't have regular iced tea here so I got Pepsi. The drinks were filled up so much that when I put my straw in, the soda started overflowing onto the table. My boyfriend got up and asked for napkins. We used those but the soda continued to spill over so a man came over and wiped it with a rag. What a debacle. It occurred to me that they might put guacamole on my taquitos. My boyfriend saw them putting guac and pico on the fries. Oh no! I didn't even think about that! In my mind it's just meat and cheese (and maybe sour cream). So he went back up and asked them not to put anything on my taquitos. They proceeded to ignore this request and had to remake them. Ugh. When we got the carne asada fries, we very meticulously scooped off the pico chunks, but there's no way to erase the liquid guacamole, so I had to eat around it. Aside from that, the fries were pretty good. But I was reminded why taquitos aren't that amazing. They were mostly corn tortilla with very little meat inside. We asked for a side of sour cream. It cost $0.65, even though it probably would've come on my plate in the first place. Whatever. The rice and beans were pretty decent. As we were finishing our meal, a COCKROACH ran across the floor and under our table. My boyfriend squashed it and I suddenly lost my appetite. For me, a cucaracha is a deal breaker. We will definitely NOT be eating here again.

Wanted pancakes for dinner and went to IHOP. There were only a couple customers in the restaurant but not a worker to be found. Waited at the front until the hostess emerged. It was very cold in there. Shortly after we were seated, the server came over to take our drink order. Hot tea and water. For food I selected the pick-a-pancake combo with blueberry pancakes, eggs scrambled/well done, hash browns, and bacon. I purposely said blueberry pancakes to see if they would interpret that as double blueberry pancakes with the blueberries in the batter and on top. They did. Fun little experiment. The eggs were cooked to my liking. The hash browns were also cooked nicely. You could see they used a lot of oil to get the browning even. Nothing to really say about the bacon. But I enjoyed the meal (very filling!) and the service was pretty good. So far this location has been quite a bit better than Dysart. 3.5 stars rounds to 4.

Went to Culver's for dinner lastnight. Had a full punch card so I got a free value basket! I got the Butterburger Cheese (single) basket with cheese curds. My boyfriend got fries with his basket so we could share sides. Everything was very good. There was a big family that ordered after us so the employees seemed to get a bit frazzled by the large order. We noticed a guy at a table by us waiting a very long time to get his food. But I guess we got in at the right time and had a good meal.

Awful experience. Went in for pedicure. The guy who worked on my feet made me uncomfortable. Like he would ask me a question and I would answer but he would just keep looking at me smiling so I wasn't sure whether or not he heard/understood me or if he was just being weird... It was very uncomfortable. Then after he polished my toes, I thought that the polish didn't look smooth but I wasn't sure if it was just the light playing tricks on me. But when I got home, I realized they looked like utter crap. I should have trusted my eyes and made him re-do them. They were already closed for the night so there was no going back and I have a flight to catch in the morning. I ended up removing the polish and painting them myself. What a waste of $27! That includes the $1 they charge you for using your card... So I got totally screwed and it pissed me off. I am never going back there again.

I have been going to The Joint for 3 months now. I like that they are open on the weekends, which is why I decided to try it over a traditional chiropractor. I've been worked on by 3 different people here. While I generally feel better right after getting adjusted, it isn't lasting. I also don't feel like they are very thorough here. I've been telling them there's a spot on my back that's been bothering me for a couple months now. The guy today cracked my neck, then popped my back (left and right) and that was it. Really? I can do that myself at home! What's the point? I also didn't like that I smelled like the guy when I got home and had to change my shirt, but the smell was still in my hair. :( I'm going to try a different location and see if they actually listen to me and do a proper job. I know they don't do appointments, but one thing I wish they did was online check-in (like Great Clips has) to minimize the wait time.

Gave Pita Kitchen another shot and per the owner's recommendation, ordered the Chicken Kabobs. Great choice! Not dry like the Chicken Shawarma I tried before. The chicken was well seasoned and tasty with the pita bread and rice. I got fries instead of the salad or hummus. The fries were battered & good, although they did not taste fresh from the fryer. But I enjoyed my meal & will be glad to return for more Chicken Kabobs.

Went to Jersey Mike's for dinner. It was freezing inside. Took several minutes for anyone to greet us. The guy who took our order mumbled so it was difficult to understand him. I asked for the regular meatball sub on white. Waited several more minutes to pay. They were moving very sloooowwwly. We went outside to eat since it was so cold in there. My boyfriend's Chicken Philly was on wheat bread even though he asked for white. The meatballs on my sandwich were big and covered in cheese, but I thought the sub roll was too bready and ended up discarding a portion of it because it was too much. I think my previous experience here was better.

Went to Five Guys for dinner. On our way there, I placed an order on my phone to speed up the process a bit. When we arrived, there were a few people in line. We walked over to the pickup counter and let them know we had placed an online order. They had the ticket and said our food would be ready soon. The guy handed us our cups and we went over to the Coca Cola Freestyle machines to get our drinks. I got the Peach Sprite. Love that combination! Went to use the restroom and then just a couple minutes later our food was ready. The online ordering probably saved us about 5 minutes. I had the Little Cheeseburger (1 patty... if you haven't been here, know that the Regular is 2 patties) with lite ketchup/mustard/pickles (sometimes they overdo the ketchup), and split a regular fry with my boyfriend, which was plenty because they fill up the cup and dump even more fries into the bag. Their fries are so good! Skins on, hot, and crisp on the outside yet soft on the inside. It's what I envision home cooked fries to be like. The burger also reminds me of something I'd want to make at home. The only thing I don't really like about Five Guys is how loud the music is... usually a mix of Classic Rock and Alternative. Also the burgers are $6+ so don't expect a cheap meal, but it'll be worth it!

I have been on the hunt for a good Chinese place for a long time and I finally found it! My other half & I dined in and got the Orange Chicken, Teriyaki Chicken, and Hibachi Fried Rice w/ chicken to share. I did not try the salad. The rice was my favorite! Exactly how fried rice should be. I will come back again & again just for that! The orange chicken was tasty too, hot & crispy with a good sauce. The teriyaki was good also, but it needed to be hotter. Took the steamed rice home to eat with the leftovers. Our server was very friendly and kept our iced tea filled. No fortune cookies here. The music was pretty much all soft pop from the 80's & 90's. Very mellow atmosphere. Keep up the great work Samurai! We will be back! Want to try some noodles next time. :)

There are much closer frozen yogurt shops to me than this one, but I like to try new places so we ventured out. When we walked in we were greeted by a spider next to the welcome mat. Well hello there! As we headed toward the yogurt the lady behind the counter asked if we had been there before and handed us some sample cups. I ended up with a brownie topped with mint, peanut butter, chocolate, vanilla, and cake batter flavored yogurts and waffle cone pieces, gummy bears, cheesecake bites, and chocolate raisins. It was pretty tasty. I just felt they didn't have quite as many flavors as some of the other yogurt places.

Stopped in for a hot dog after a trip to the mall. While waiting, I also ordered a burger and fries to bring back to my friend. Enjoyed my hot dog with ketchup, mustard, and relish, along with a Cherry Coke from the Coca Cola Freestyle machine. Snatched a few fries out of my friend's bag too... the cup was overflowing so he wouldn't even notice. ;)

I ordered the Maui (teriyaki) Burger with no lettuce or tomato, fries and a drink, and my boyfriend ordered a BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger meal so we could share both. The guy behind the counter was friendly and helpful. Our burgers were good, although I think the cheese stood out more than the teriyaki flavor. Love their fries--they are battered and yummy. We also enjoyed the music that was playing there. Need to try a hot dog next time!

Went to Oregano's for dinner on New Year's Day to start the year out right. They were really busy, as they always are. The hostess quoted our wait to be 1 hr to 1 hr 10 min. It was very cold outside, but I was dressed warmly and they had the heaters on so it wasn't too bad. A guy brought out pizza samples a couple of times for the people waiting. Always appreciated. My friend went inside to get me a glass of water from the bar. Our wait only ended up being 45-50 min. It's amazing the crowds that Oregano's brings in and how many people are willing to wait. I really wish they operated in bigger buildings. I'm sure they do it for the ambiance (and maybe cost of the space), but they would be successful in a larger space too. I know I would eat here more often if the wait times were shorter. When we got to our table, I had to switch chairs because the one looked like it had grease on it... then my chair wobbled--I think the tiles were uneven. Small annoyances. Also the lighting was very dim and I used my phone to light up the menu. We ordered the garlic cheese bread with marinara... that is a must for a visit at Oregano's. When it came out, it was really garlicky! It always is, but I think this one was at another level. Very tasty though. For my entree, I ordered the Bollo Pasta (angel hair) with meatballs. This dish is actually unlimited but I can never get through one bowl after the garlic bread and still save a little room for Pizookie! I love the peanut butter chocolate chip they have now, but we got the original chocolate chip. Didn't even finish it... I was so full! Looking forward to the opening of the Goodyear location. One other comment I have is about the Zany Ziti... now I'm not a pasta expert, but I know the pasta they use for this dish is diagonal cut, not square cut as I know ziti to be. Not sure why they call it ziti if it's actually penne?

Rode the light rail to Mill Ave. We had already eaten lunch, but Steak 'n Shakes are few & far between on this side of the country, so we had to stop in for some fries. Ordered our fries & iced teas on the kiosk (fun)! Tasty fries... wish we hadn't already eaten. Would've liked to try a burger. Next time...

Good chicken fingers and fries, but the drinks were all watered down! Both the iced tea and the fountain drinks... awful. :( They really need to correct that. I couldn't even get water cuz the Hi-C was contaminating it. And my Texas toast was cold again... =\

The chicken fingers and the fries were hot and fresh, but I just want to reiterate how watered down the regular iced tea was and that I was unable to get water because it shares a spout with the Hi-C and it was coming out pink. I was forced to get root beer, which I didn't want. PLEASE FIX YOUR ICED TEA! It tastes like water. Thank you.

It happened to be busier than it normally is when we come, so it took a little longer to order and get our food. The guy in front of us left his dog in the car for like 20 minutes which bothered me. Not sure why he didn't just go through the drive thru... I ordered the Crispy Chicken Strips combo with regular fries. Their new Coca Cola Freestyle Machine was out of many drink options. I wanted Peach Sprite but it was one of the numerous choices that was greyed out. My b/f informed the workers of the drink situation since they were oblivious. But we did not see anyone replace the flavor cartridges while we were there. The tables and floors were filthy. Don't know that I've seen the dining area so dirty before. We wiped one off with some napkins. When we got our food, mine tasted pretty good, but my b/f's fries were so oversalted they were glistening. It was bad enough that they had to be taken back. The good part was that he got fresh fries which were really hot and good. But they should have done it right the first time. A poor JIB visit overall.

Got a Steakhouse Burger with fries. It was really good! Also enjoyed the complimentary bread. There were several desserts we wanted to try. Went with a couple of minis. The banana cream pie and carrot cake. The pie tasted like your average thawed, frozen pie. The carrot cake was very good though. Our server wasn't the greatest, but I have enjoyed the food here so we'll be back when we're ready to spend a little more on dinner.

Love Cafe Rio Sweet Pork! We try to come about once a month. Last night we decided on a sweet pork quesadilla and shredded beef nachos (with shredded cheese, black beans, and sour cream on the side) to share. I had never had their shredded beef before. I liked it! The sweet pork was amazing as always, and the tortilla was full of it! So good. As for the service and ambiance, the girl behind the counter seemed a bit scattered, and the dining area was full of noisy kids. They were also out of unsweetened iced tea. So some disappointments, but the food makes up for it. I also like their stamp cards so after 10 stamps you get a free meal!

I was thinking about XXL Nachos and went to Taco Bell. I got there only to find the XXL Nachos have gone away! Boo. Next best thing, Nachos Bell Grande (no tomatoes) to share with my friend and a Cheesy Potato Burrito. While waiting for our food, I tried a couple of beverages. Mtn Dew Sangrita... didn't care for it. And Brisk Lemonade Tea... also not great. So I ended up with Pepsi. But even that didn't taste right. It wasn't sweet as Pepsi should be... Not sure what's up with their fountain drinks. When the food came out, we found that my friend was shorted a soft taco. He went back up to get it and they ended up giving him an extra one. My burrito and nachos tasted as they should. Nothing amazing, they simply met my expectations. Wish they still had the XXL Nachos though...

Brought my friend here for a birthday dinner. The parking lot looked pretty full, but it wasn't very busy inside, so I guess the cars were for the neighboring Texas Roadhouse or Black Angus. I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken with mashed potatoes and asparagus. To drink, I got the white peach sangria. Everything tasted great! The chicken was juicy and the sangria was yummy (and big). Our waitress was attentive, almost too attentive, but that's always preferred to the alternative. For dessert, we shared the chocolate lava cake. Normally I don't like the mushiness of chocolate lava cake, but I don't know if they overcooked this one because I actually liked it. It was not a cheap meal, but nice for a special occasion.

I'm definitely a fan of these fast-casual pizza places (Fired Pie, Mod Pizza, and Pieology) and tried Pizza Studio before going to a concert at Comerica Theatre. I was surprised to see they don't have an actual pizza oven, but rather the conveyor belt kind. I went with the original crust, marinara sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, and meatball. They also top it off with Italian seasoning. They brought our pizzas out in boxes, even though we said dine-in. Had to ask for plates/pans to eat on. The pizza was very good. The crust is not as crispy as the competition so it's easy fold in half like New York style pizza. Very tasty indeed. I tried some of my b/f's BBQ Chicken Bacon pizza, but the BBQ sauce was very subtle... you barely knew it was there. Not impressed with that, but the toppings were good.

Went here for lunch today with a friend. Fortunately the place was not packed as Oregano's usually are. But even though there were plenty of open tables, we were still told there would be a 5-10 minute wait. Okay. It was closer to 10 min, but not a big deal. We ordered the garlic cheese bread with marinara, which is a must when I come to Oregano's. It's probably my favorite thing. For my entree, I went with the Zany Ziti (which is actually penne) and since it's supposed to have meat sauce, I decided against paying extra for meatballs. But when I received it, it was not meat sauce, just marinara. That was a disappointment! The pasta was also overcooked and falling apart. Not the best. For dessert we got the chocolate chip pizookie since they are always tasty. Wish I could give a higher rating, but the pasta was a big fail.

Went to Daily Donut last Friday morning. It was my second visit. I got an old fashioned glazed donut and split a blueberry-filled donut with my boyfriend. They were both very tasty! The lady was also nice and helpful.

I had not been to Rudy's for many months because I really was never impressed with their pulled pork and much prefer a couple other BBQ joints in Phoenix. But I decided to give their brisket a try. I had sampled the lean brisket when they first opened and it was really dry, so I decided to get the moist brisket, which seems to be very popular. That was a mistake. It was so fatty! Which, yes, I understand that's what makes it moist, but it was just so unappetizing to me. I really don't care much for their BBQ sauce either. It's too peppery. The potato salad was barely cold. The beans were OK, but not as good as I remembered. No more Rudy's for me. I'll just keep making the drive to Pork on a Fork & Bobby Q!

I think they have the best frozen yogurt as compared to Yogurtland and Yogurtini. Seems thicker and the flavors are good. I kept it simple and got the Strawberry Sensations and Vanilla with some cheesecake bites, chocolate covered raisins, a couple Circus Animal cookies, and a Kit Kat. They don't have quite as many toppings as Yogurtini but it's a good selection and they also have waffle cones (that I have yet to try). One thing I noticed today were the giant spiderwebs on the ceiling. Counted over a dozen daddy long legs up there. They really need to clean up those webs...

Stopped in to grab a quick bite. Got my usual: Slim 4 (turkey) w/ cheese and bacon. I usually get the Thinny Chips to add some crunch to my meal, but I didn't this time and I missed them... Would've been on our way quickly except the guy at the register neglected to put "no mayo" for my b/f's sandwich so they had to remake it. Oh well. I enjoyed my sandwich with a little mustard and a refreshing iced tea. 3.5 rounds to 4.

Tried Firehouse Subs for the first time and it was great! My friend and I ordered a large meatball sub on white to share and the girl at the register asked if we wanted split baskets. Yes, please! That sub was LEGIT. Big, yummy meatballs covered in tasty marinara sauce and melted cheese on a soft sub roll. Really good. And we each got a pickle too. The decor is fun with the firefighter theme and Dalmatian-spotted tables. The dining room was clean and the employees were friendly. I'll be back for sure!

I had a hankering for some gourmet mac & cheese and a Yelp search found me this place. I had no idea there was a brewery just down the road in Goodyear... and with strong reviews! My b/f and I thought we'd give it a try. They had some live music (The Spirited Lads) which seemed a little loud at first but we found ourselves entertained during the meal. The dining area really isn't very big, so I could see it getting pretty crowded on the weekends. Fortunately, it was a Wednesday. I ordered the Mac N' Cheese (shells, Gouda, Gruyere, and bacon w/ a small baguette) and my b/f had the Herb Chicken Sandwich with fries. We got our food in a timely manner and it was good, just had to pick off the scallions! The portions are not huge, pretty sensible really. The mac could even be improved upon if they added some of that herb chicken in there... But we were happy and I would like to go back and try some other menu items.

Tried Fired Pie yesterday for lunch and I liked it! It was very busy and most tables were occupied. I thought that made sense since there are very few food options at Tanger. The girls behind the counter were busy prepping other orders and took a little while to acknowledge us. For my pizza I got the tomato sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, and meatball. I think the girl seemed annoyed when I asked her to pick off the tiny piece of green lettuce that ended up on my cheese... =\ The restaurant felt pretty warm inside at first (makes sense with the pizza oven, all the people, and it being 110+ outside) but it seemed to get better. I was very happy with my pizza! The crust was thin but soft, which I love (unlike Pieology whose crust was like a cracker). The toppings were very good. I'd probably get some oregano next time too. Swapped a couple slices for my boyfriend's BBQ chicken bacon pizza and I really liked that also. So while the employees weren't the friendliest, the food was very good!

Went to try El Pollo Loco for the first time. This is a new location in a building that used to be a Wienerschnitzel and then Costa Vida. It was very busy and while standing in line one customer kept passing in front of me going to and from the salsa bar, which was annoying. When we got up to the counter I asked the cashier what the chicken burrito has in it. She said "Which one?" I said, "The regular one." "Classic?" "Yes." Thought that was pretty clear. She started to say creamy cilantro and then corrected herself, "pico de gallo" and then named a couple other ingredients. She didn't seem too confident, which had me a little concerned. Didn't want to end up with anything green on my burrito. I ordered that meal (with chips and a drink) and asked for no pico. She seemed somewhat inexperienced entering our order on the register. When we got our food, I cut open the burrito to verify its contents. Rice, beans, chicken, and cheese. No pico. That's good. Got some mild salsa from the salsa bar. It was very watery and had almost no flavor. The pico was just as watery but with larger chunks. Tried the fire roasted salsa which had the most flavor but I didn't care for the thick consistency. So I mixed the mild with the fire roasted. Better. The chips were lousy. Cold and... not stale, but almost a burnt taste. My friend ordered a small mac & cheese and fries so we could both try them. The mac & cheese was identical to KFC. The fries were most akin to Sonic's. Nothing special. And the burrito was fine. For my friend's meal, he did get the guac on the side as he requested, but they forgot to leave the pico off his quesadilla. The people kept coming in... there was a continuous line. I guess people like it? I will comment that the salsa bar was difficult to access because it's small and people were always getting salsa. I wasn't impressed by any means, but I would go back. I want to try the desserts (churros and cheesecake chimi).

I did not realize this location existed until seeing it on Yelp today. Guess it just opened 6 weeks ago. I've had a couple of good subs from Jersey Mike's in the past and thought we'd give the new one a try. It was busy when we arrived and were behind some difficult customers, like a man who asked for several of every condiment on the side and the employees had to find some more plastic cups. Ugh. I ordered a regular Club Sub (turkey, ham, bacon, provolone) on white bread. The girl behind the counter asked if I wanted it Mike's Way and I said no and had to stop her before she slathered mayo on the bread. I only wanted mustard and pickles. We finally paid, got some iced tea, and found a booth that was relatively clean. Most of the tables were filthy and needed to be wiped. When I unwrapped my sandwich, I found that the bread was hard as a rock. I took one bite and was not happy. My friend's bread was softer than mine. He offered to take mine back up and have them make another sandwich. The girl said all their bread was like that and she looked around for a softer loaf. The one I ended up with was slightly better, but it was still too hard on the outside. I think they just overcooked the batch because the bread I've had at Jersey Mike's in the past has been soft. What a disappointment. Also, the bacon left a weird aftertaste and I ended up pulling it off my sandwich halfway through. I probably won't come back to this location.

Jersey Mike's has redeemed itself. We decided to give this location another shot and it did not disappoint. I got the Chicken Parm sub on white bread and also had some of my boyfriend's BBQ Beef sub. Super good! Reminded me of an Arby-Q, but better! The bread was soft this time, as it should be. The guy at the register was really friendly too. Nice job. My only suggestions would be to speed up sandwich assembly a bit and to please wipe down the tables!

My boyfriend and I finally decided to try this place after going in two different times just to look. All the different flavor combinations kinda freak me out a little bit since I tend to stick with glazed or chocolate frosted donuts. We decided to try the O.C. Sand (honey glaze + cinnamon sugar) and Cookies & Cream (vanilla glaze + cookie crumbs). I liked the sheets of paper that you make your selections on (like Which Wich, where we had eaten earlier). Got to watch our donuts being made. I thought the pools of glaze that they plop the donuts into looked strange and also noticed the toppings get cross-contaminated from the different glazes. Hmm... interesting. When I tried the donuts, I was pleasantly surprised! They were still warm and had a nice texture. For some reason I thought the donuts were going to be cold and dense. Definitely happy with our selections. I guess I'll have to come back and try some other flavors.

Decided to give Pieology one more shot to see if they had, in fact, improved their crunchy, cracker-like crust. Yes, they had! I got a pepperoni & bacon pizza and the crust was pleasantly crisp, but not crunchy. Well done, Pieology! One observation is that they don't have as many toppings to choose from as Fired Pie & Mod Pizza, but still among the most flavorful.

I know Oregano's doesn't normally do call ahead seating, but we thought we'd give it a try since it's a new location. Nope. First come, first serve, they said. My friend headed over to put our name on the list to save some time as I was leaving work. They quoted him an 1 hour 25 min. It ended up being around 45 minutes. Not bad! It was a very nice evening to eat on the patio. Our server was nice but said he was "under the weather". Hope it's not contagious... We ordered the garlic cheese bread with marinara (it's a must!) as we decided on the main course. It was delicious, as always. As my friend finished his glass of water, I noticed there was an empty pink sweetener packet in his cup.... What is THAT doing in there? Did they give him a dirty cup? Kind of disturbing. He asked our server for another glass. So weird! We knew it was going to be a wait, but we ended up ordering the 10" stuffed pizza with pepperoni and meatball, since I don't think I'd ever had it before. It took another 45 minutes to get. The pizza was EXTREMELY cheesy. Too much cheese, really. Made me a little sick to my stomach. And I think it was overcooked because the crust was really crunchy. What a disappointment! I definitely won't be ordering that again... But I'll be back for the garlic bread and pizookie.

I was interested to see a new frozen yogurt shop opening in the area and was eager to compare it to Yogurtland, Yogurtini, and Razzleberriez. It was Saturday night and there was quite a crowd. We had to get in line for our yogurt. I didn't see a lot of flavors that I was interested in trying, but I did sample the Carrot Orange Boost Sorbet which was delicious! Tasted like a Creamsicle. So I put some of that into my cup. Then I added some Peanut Butter flavor and sampled the Green Apple Tart. Yucky! I do not like tart frozen yogurt. It tastes too much like regular yogurt and not ice cream. So I finished up with the classics: Snowy Vanilla and Pure Chocolate. Then for toppings! They had a lot of different candies, but I skipped those and got some kiwi, a cherry, cheesecake bites, brownie bites, and... a chocolate covered strawberry? WHAT?! Awesome! I think their topping selection beats Yogurtini. We weighed and paid, then sat outside to eat our yogurt. The yogurt was yummy! Thick and creamy consistency, comparable to Razzleberriez. The kiwi was actually ripe, as was the strawberry! Not sour at all. I was impressed. Yogurtland may be the cheapest, but Menchie's wins on quality! I'm interested to try future flavors. The only thing Menchie's was really lacking... no complimentary water!

I wanted to try this place because I had never had Dole Whip before and saw they have Scooptacular ice cream, which is amazing. The ice creams they had to choose from weren't any I was interested in... I was hoping for Cookie Monster, Manners Please, or Chocolate Covered Strawberry, but no such luck. So I decided to try the Pineapple Dole Whip in a cone. I have to say I was disappointed. I thought it would be creamier, like frozen yogurt, but it was just icy and tart. Very underwhelming. I tossed it out before I even got to the cone. Guess I'll have to keep driving the 15 miles to Scooptacular.

Saw this new pizza place opened and that it was the same format as Pieology and Fired Pie, so I had to try it and compare. I was surprised how big it is! We entered on the south side, but I guess the main entrance is on the west side. They were quite busy and unfortunately we got behind a group of people who didn't understand how it worked and seemed very confused. I don't know what's so confusing about selecting any toppings you want for your own personal pizza... And they were ordering several pizzas for their large party, so it took awhile. But once we finally got up to order, I went with a Mod Pizza with red sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, crumbled meatball, bacon, and oregano. My boyfriend got BBQ sauce, chicken, and bacon. Waited at the register for several minutes to pay because the cashier was helping get pizzas out of the oven and cut into slices. While we were waiting we got to see our pizzas go into the oven. We then got our drinks and sat down at a table. Just a couple minutes later our pizzas were ready. They only cut it into 4 pieces and I prefer smaller slices so I grabbed a plastic knife. The pizza was great! Crispy (not crunchy), thin crust and the toppings had great flavor. I also tried the BBQ pizza and it was good too. The sauce is more smoky than sweet. We also experimented with the tea and lemonade to make Arnold Palmers, which I enjoyed. So aside from the annoying customers, I was quite happy with this place.

Decided to give this place a try. There was a lady in front of us who was really annoying. She was very indecisive, kept walking around us, pointing at different items to ask about, and just holding up the line. She really tested my patience. Got the 2 entree plate with half fried rice, half noodles, orange chicken, and teriyaki chicken. It was a ton of food! They really pile it on there. The fried rice was different from Panda's... smaller grains, no egg, and has onion in it. It was okay. I liked the noodles. I didn't care for the orange chicken. The flavor of the sauce was very understated and I didn't really like it. The teriyaki chicken was pretty good though. I had a lot of food left over, but I didn't think it was worth taking a to-go box so it went in the trash. While it wasn't horrible, I don't really see a need to return.

Ate here for dinner last night. I did not realize this is a new location! My boyfriend and I ordered the 15 boneless wing combo with large, unseasoned fries, two iced teas, and added a yeast roll. For our sauces we asked for lemon pepper, BBQ, and teriyaki. She said they could only do two sauces. At the location at 75th Ave they always let us do three sauces. It just makes sense! 5-5-5. If you can order five wings with one sauce, couldn't you just order three sets of five wings and get three sauces? What's the difference? So that annoyed me. We eliminated the BBQ and settled on the other two. The place was a lot bigger than the one on 75th. It wasn't busy when we got there, but it got busier as time went on. Didn't take too long to get our food. It was hot and fresh! The fries were great with a little salt. Rather than one large order, she brought us a regular order and told us more were coming. The lemon pepper flavor is always delicious. I forgot to count if we actually got 15 wings, but I think we may have been shorted a couple in lieu of some larger wings. The food was really good though. My tea was a little strong and needed some more ice, but my refill was better. Everything was good until a really smelly customer came in just as we were finishing. Time to go!

Had to try the new Krispy Kreme in its first week! When we walked in, there weren't any donuts coming down the line. It took a minute from them to start coming out. We watched the donuts make their way into the oil and on to the waterfall of glaze. It's fun to watch. When we walked up to the counter, a lady informed us that their machine had broken and there would be a 40 minute wait for fresh donuts, or we could get another kind. That explains why there was a guy standing outside by the drive thru--to notify people there were no original glazed available. It was a little disappointing, but not a deal breaker. I observed that several donuts were clearly in the wrong spots in the display case. We also didn't see any peach pie or lemon kreme cake donuts. We decided to split a chocolate frosted donut and cinnamon apple filled. Yum yum! We'll have to go back when they have hot donuts.

It hasn't even been open a week and we've gone twice. Ha! We wanted to see if they had their machine back up and running. They did... hundreds of glazed donuts going on down the line. Though it makes me sad to see the less-than-perfect donuts end up in the trash. :( They had the "Southern Classics" this time, Peach Pie and Lemon Kreme Cake. We got one of each to take home. Warmed them up in the microwave and devoured them. They were delicious! Krispy Kreme makes me happy. :)

Called and made an appointment for 3. 2 manicures, 2 pedicures. When we arrived, the lady seemed confused that there were 3 people as she was expecting 2... Didn't know I had to spell it out. 3 people. 1 mani only. 1 pedi only. 1 mani/pedi. But it all worked out ok. Got the Exfoliating Pedicure which included the sugar scrub, callus treatment, paraffin wax, and hot stones. The guy doing my pedicure had very strong hands and it was almost too much pressure on my legs and feet, but still a good experience overall. My skin was very soft, toes turned out nice, as did my French manicure, although they always push the gel, which I don't like. Unfortunately I messed up a thumbnail getting my car keys out of my purse... :(

I had been eagerly awaiting the opening of this Firehouse Subs since I saw it was coming soon! We were driving all the way out to Buckeye to eat there. So once it opened, we had to go. I ordered the meatball sub, which is what I had on my first visit, and it was just as good as I remembered. I like how consistent this place is. My biggest complaint was our wobbly table. This place just opened and they didn't take the time to stabilize their tables & chairs. I guess they were in a hurry to open. Our table also had some sticky soda splattered on it, which wasn't easy to notice with all the Dalmatian spots. But aside from that, this place is great. Very happy they are close by now.

Ordered the Hook & Ladder Light (turkey & ham) plain and got an order of chili to try/share. The chili was very good and the sandwich was really good and then I decided to try a spoonful of chili on my sandwich... It was amazing. I may always have to order chili with my subs going forward. That combination just made my day.

Had to try WaBa Grill after seeing all the good reviews! When we went in, the guy at the register was very friendly and shared some info about WaBa's meats and gave us some recommendations too, which was appreciated. I ordered the Half-Half Bowl (steak & chicken) with white rice. They had 3 different tea choices and I went with the Passion Fruit Black Tea, which was good. Tried a little Coconut Pineapple Green Tea too, which was also not bad. My first bite into the chicken I bit down on a hard piece of tendon. Not a good way to start! I was hoping that would be the end of it, but there were at least a couple more tendon-y pieces in there that I had to spit out. And it wasn't just mine. My b/f had some in his too. What a junky cut of meat! I don't know if they trim the meat back there or if it comes pre-trimmed, but those people need to learn how to do it properly. I was also unimpressed with the steak as I really didn't like the heavy char on it (was almost like eating charcoal at times) and it had some inedible gristle as well... Lost my appetite about halfway through. :( I had such high hopes for WaBa, but I was very disappointed in the food. Based on this experience, I would much rather go to Yogi's for a good teriyaki bowl.

Was in the area and came to this Jimmy John's for lunch. There was one person working a register and at least 5 other people standing around doing nothing. There wasn't a long line, but at other Jimmy John's they will usually open the 2nd register so you don't have to wait. Not sure why that didn't happen here. I got my usual Slim 4 (Turkey, add cheese & bacon) with Thinny Chips & an iced tea. It was NOT freaky fast. Probably about the slowest I've seen. I wish the French bread was softer... it's so dense and my jaw gets tired when eating their sandwiches. During lunch we were distracted by a disabled vehicle outside that was blocking the parking lot and other drivers were having to maneuver around it, including us when we left. Below average JJ experience.

Saw this restaurant opened recently and gave it a try. We had a really good breakfast here. I had the Wagon Wheel Pancake (huge) with scrambled eggs (well done) and bacon. I also tried some of the potatoes my boyfriend got. Everything was yummy. And the food came out quick! I was surprised. Will definitely be back.

I really enjoy the Pork on a Fork off Deer Valley, so I wanted to give this new location a try, even though it's only slightly closer to us. Visually this location is very different with a large, modern looking dining area. The people behind the counter had some communication issues. The lady in front of us ordered something that included sausage but for whatever reason the guy at the counter didn't know they were out of sausage and another person had to inform the lady that the sausage was out. Weird. And then he offered the same thing to the people after us and he had to be reminded that they were out of sausage... It was pretty slow making our way down the line even though no one else was there. It was seriously a ghost town. I got a beef brisket sandwich, macaroni & cheese, and beans. Although the service could've been better, the food was excellent. The brisket was tender & delicious and the mac & cheese was actually hot. The beans were spicier than I remember but still good. One odd thing was that their teas are in a different area than the fountain drinks. I couldn't figure out why the place was so empty... Maybe because of the construction in the neighboring Fry's parking lot? I hope business picks up here because the food is really good.

Finally went to check out the new casino and ended up returning the next day. :) It isn't a huge place (yet) but I found a good penny machine that I got to play on for awhile. Didn't end up winning anything but I had fun. Love the self-serve soda & tea. No alcohol yet, but I don't drink very often so that doesn't bother me. The casino was not overly smoky, although your clothes/hair still smell like it when you leave. It's definitely nice having a casino that's only 15 minutes away, as opposed to 35 min-1+ hrs. The latest ruling says the tribe is allowed to move forward with Class 3 gaming. I am hoping they add roulette in the future.

I was excited to see this location was opening up since I really enjoy the Fired Pie at the Tanger Outlets and this one is closer to home. I got a pizza with red sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, meatball, and bacon. It was a little slow getting through the line even though there were only a few people in front of us. I was amazed to see a Pepsi version of the Coca Cola Freestyle machine. It did not have as many combinations although the fruity Mountain Dews looked interesting. But I just got iced tea. The pizza was good. The crust was softer than I'm used to, but that's not a bad thing. Only thing missing was some oregano. I'll have to remember that next time.

I was pretty excited when I saw BK has hot dogs now! Had to give them a try. Got a Classic Grilled Dog combo with no onion. It was tasty! Like a hot dog you grilled in your own backyard. Mmm Mm! Fries were hot & fresh too. Had to ask for iced tea at the counter because they didn't have any at the drink station. The restaurant was still pretty clean. Yay for hot dogs!

I was kind of excited when I saw this place was opening (even though it went in the place of 5 & Diner, which I loved!). I haven't eaten at a Noodles & Company in probably 15 years, so I was interested to try it again. I decided to get good old fashioned spaghetti & meatballs and shared some garlic bread with my other half. The garlic bread was pretty good, but the spaghetti was a very poor choice. The meatballs were obviously your average, boring, frozen meatballs. The sauce really didn't have a whole lot of flavor, and there wasn't enough of it, so the noodles were very plain tasting. Very disappointing. If I do ever decide to come back, I will definitely get something else.
