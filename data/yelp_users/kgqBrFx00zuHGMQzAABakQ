I love dive bars. But dive bars should have dive bar prices, not $5 for a Corona. And please, when I ask for water don't tell me "we only have bottled water" and charge me $2. Not true and not cool.

Perfectly good place to grab a quick sandwich downtown. Quick service even during the lunch rush.

Incredibly helpful and friendly staff. They make it easy to find exactly what you're looking for--and quickly!

3.5 stars rounded up.   Food: Really glad I ordered the cochinita pibil entree. The cochinita was really well cooked and still moist, though not served (and maybe not prepared) in banana leaf. Served as make-your-own-tacos. Friend ordered carne asada tacos, which seemed fine.   Drink: Small full bar with a medium-sized beer menu.   Service: Table service was very attentive. Problem was with the door staff, which told us the wait was "25 minutes or less" and turned out to be a full hour. People weren't sat in the order they arrived. Despite having a good number of staff around, they just weren't turning tables over; empty tables would sit unbussed for 15 minutes. We waited on their little patio, which was fine enough, except the staff kept coming out onto the patio, staring vacantly at the street, and then engaging each other in really animated conversations about nothing. The whole thing was a bit weird.   Ambiance: Crowded and a little bit noisy, but not unenjoyable.   Bottom line: They've reached some level of fame on the back of their good food. Staff just needs to keep it real. Recommend going, but not waiting if there's a long line.

Had to pay a $5 cover to sit on the patio and endure one of their salads, which consisted of lettuce, chicken, croutons, and nothing else. Maybe a good environment for football, but not much else.

Slowest. Starbucks. Ever. Consistently.   Very frustrating location. Better to head down the road to the next Starbucks, or, better yet, support local businesses!

Great selection of about 30 mostly European beers along with maybe five wines on tap. A pretty basic food menu. An $11 order of tacos gives you two tasty tacos, probably not enough for a full dinner. Nice, pretty spacious outdoor patio. Definitely go for the beer.

Pizza: Really creative combinations, all of which are good. My favorites are Sweet Potato (sweet potato, sage, and ricotta) and Cassanova (dates, prosciutto, ricotta). Even the Brussels Sprout (roasted in balsamic + garlic) is tasty. Order one per person.   Drink: Solid and cheap beer selection. Never had wine here, but they've got a lengthy list.   Service: Friendly hipster service staff.   Ambiance: Pretty standard stuff. More a restaurant than a pizzeria. The outside patio is right on Central and so a bit loud.   Price: Beer=cheap. Pizzas about $12-14 each.   Bottom line: Highly recommended.

Made a reservation online for a 545 AM trip to Sky Harbor. Received multiple confirmations, including a text a half hour before the pick up. There is a discounted  rate for airport trip with advance notice. Cab was on time (a little early actually) and clean. Service wet much appreciated; will use for airport transfers in the future.
