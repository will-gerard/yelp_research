probably the coolest reptile store I have ever been in. Service was friendly and the staff was extremely knowledgeable about the lizard that I bought. I highly recommend this place for a first time reptile parent!

My wife delivered a baby at Chandler Regional on July 5, 2014 we both feel like we had an awesome experience delivering at this hospital. The doctors and nursing staff were awesome. We stayed 5 nights and 4 days.

Food was good, service was good. Drinks were a little slow but they were awesome once they arrived. The prime rib was good, but the new york strip was superb! I recommend the chocolate martini or the black and tan to drink.

Bought my engagement ring here. The sales woman was very polite and a true professional. She kept me within my budget and helped us find a beautiful ring. Also the application for credit was quick and discreet. I definitely would make another big purchase here.

If you care anything about the items you're trying to ship or receive you shouldn't use this UPS location. They lost a very expensive package of mine and offered NO HELP in tracking down the package or offering any sort of empathy for my situation. After going in to the location once and calling several times to see if there were any leads on the package. The person who I spoke to on the phone Josh had a major attitude problem from the minute this moron got on the phone. He ended up hanging up on me, definitely one of the most unprofessional thing for a company can do to a paying customer.. but conveniently I live across the street so I drove down to the location and we got into a huge shouting match in front of a half a dozen people just watching. The manager ended up telling him to go into the back because he looked like he was about to burst into tears. This location is run by foreigners who can barely speak english. it's been nearly 2 weeks and I still can't get any answers. If you ship your here you must be desperate.

Good food!! I always get the chow mein noodles (lo mein) or the pork rolls. The owner is often the one taking your order at the register, great place to eat.

We order take out regularly here. They always get our food right. Hot and fresh and tasting just like if we were sitting at the resturant. The service is always prompt and friendly. However remend them to give utensils they ALWAYS forget. The potato soup is awesome!

Had our vehicle (09 chevy cobalt) towed to family auto care co early this morning. They started working on the car almost immediately! and amazingly had it done by 5 o'clock the same day!! The car runs like brand new! I'd recommend family auto co to anyone! they were super reasonably priced and even showed us the parts they replaced which was a first time a mechanic had ever done that for me (fuel pump, fuel filter and replaced a broken door handle). definitely impressed with this place!

This place is the best!!! They make the noodles fresh to order and even have a little viewing window so you can watch them make it. The prices are reasonable and the staff is super friendly. I love coming here.

the guy did a good job repairing my phone. however did not write how much i paid him on the carbon copy invoice and though he accepted it, it was obvious he wasn't thrilled i had a 10% off coupon. but truthfully i'd recommend and still come back! i got my i phone 5c screen fixed for $72 out the door!!

This food was not really for me. I came in for a pick up order and there was a few people ahead of me waiting on to-go orders but there was definitely some chaos and confusion on where to go and where to stand just to talk to talk to a waiter. I ordered the pad thai with beef with level 4 hotness. The dish was more sweet than spicy and I had to put it a ton of sriracha at home just to tame the sweetness level of the sauce. I got no utensils no napkins no soy sauce no slice of lime you'd usually find on the side at "other" thai restaurants. I'm comfortable saying tonight was my first and last time here.

showed up an hour late outside the promised 8-10am time frame. the moment these greasy fools walked in they start talking extra/different charges (which i refused to pay) came very close to telling them to just go away, but had no other options. took 1.5 hours to load up, moving slow as hell but still had the nerve to ask me for water.. i couldn't believe it! then kept talking to each other in a foreign language which upset me because i knew those cowards were talking shit. once they arrived at the destination they wanted payment UP FRONT before unloading. i prepaid them for an estimated 1.5 hours to unload (based on the load up time) but suddenly they're moving with hustle like i never seen! took them only 40 minutes. your crooked karma will come back to you! i sleep well at night knowing i earn an honest living and you assholes have to bust your ass robbing people sideways to earn a few punk ass dollars. cuz thats all walking shit stains like you all are good for. get your shit right golden eagle moving.. more like golden pigeon..  the phone numbers they used to advertise are:  602-500-7426 480-207-0125
