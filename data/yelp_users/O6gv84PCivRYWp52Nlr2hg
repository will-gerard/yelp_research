We absolute LOVE this place, very delicious. You arrive into a small parking lot and head toward the small building where you order your fresh food, mostly from their farm.  Sandwiches and soups, salads and snacks galore. Once placing your order you only have outdoor seating choices. You can mosey out among the pecan trees and choose a picnic table in that area as well. When your food is ready, they call out a number from your receipt. We've brought games and music to extend our time and have some fun. This is a great place to take out of town visitors!!! You can explore the grounds, see where they grow most of the stuff you are eating. Lots of space for kids to run around as well.

I love this location. The employees are super friendly and always super helpful. The large selection of bagels and drinks are fabulous. It's always clean and wish the lines weren't as long as they are sometimes in the morning. Everything I've ever had has always been fresh. Only complaint, when I ask for extra cream cheese, I expect a ton not a thinly spreader amount.

I don't know why I allow my husband to drag me here. The salad selections are in full force here. However nothing ever looks appetizing. You start thinking to yourself, if there is so much of a salad selection, there must be more items to select on the hot stations. Sadly, not true. 3 pasta, some flat breads and a chili bar. Selections don't seem to change much. Seems like the same old crap that was here the last time I was drug here. I get disappointed because there are not healthier selections here. Booths look like they all need a good wipe down and the carpet could use a good cleaning as well.

I love this place. A lot of pottery choices and the employees are super friendly. They also offer a large table in the back for parties. I wish this place was larger! They have a large selection of paints and different finishes. If you need help the employees are always there to help you with your art, ideas, finishes and most of all encouragement. I wish I could remember the one employee who was so helpful to us on our visit on 12/12/15. She was a blondish brown haired woman with black glasses. A gentleman had sat down and she simply asked if he had a reservation. (Saturday's do get busy at this time of year). The man got huffy and said he would leave but that wasn't the point. She was just checking in with this table. The wonderful woman employee tried to explain this to the man but he was being gruff. I felt bad that this woman was all over the store trying to help everyone and he was ugly to her. I told her not to let it get to her and she just smiled her big beautiful smile and said, it won't bother me. Customer service is a difficult job and this woman was on her game! The store was filled to the brim and this woman IS the holiday spirit in this store! IT PAYS TO BE NICE! This woman is the reason we will always revisit this specific location. Being nice matters to everyone!

This is a cute family owned restaurant. Small inside but the food is SO good! We had eggplant rollatini, stuffed shells, salads and pizza. So good it's definitely an east coasters dream place. Eggplant was tender and not overly breaded. Shells were cooked to perfection! Pizza was thin and tasty. We've been coming here for years and love the people who work there. A definite stop for east coast Italians!

Love this upcycle store! All inventory changes daily and they always have good stuff that's been donated to them. Employees are super friendly and helpful. During a project I try to visit this store once a week to see if I can save money and reuse items. Great find!

Being from the NY/NJ area, this is about as close to home as it gets. It's similar in taste and quality but still missing the wood brick oven taste. The place is dimly lit, sparsely decorated. Several booths and tables with an open kitchen. I've yet to see a cook "throw" a pizza up in the air. I ordered the bruschetta pizza. It came relatively quick. It was light, fresh and the ricotta cheese has NO SUGAR ADDED! Whew! So many places in AZ think you need to add sugar. This is only for deserts fools! Happy they get what real Italians do well here. A definite place for me to get my home town food fix.

Wow! What a find! The interior is quaint and cute. They have a bar area and a dining area. We were greeted and got a nice table. The menu has so many delicious items to choose from. We started with the calamari and warmed olives. The calamari had lots of small pieces with tentacles, the best!!! I has the caprice salad and ordered the eggplant rolentini. The salad was huge! Nice heirloom tomatoes and fresh motz. The rolentini was fresh, moist and the sauce, just like my moms! REAL ITALIAN FOOD HERE FOLKS!!!  Our waiter Noah was on point! He answered questions and made suggestion. The wine list is extensive and lots of choices. They even have pistachio gelato! We will be back for happy hour and for many many more dinners. So happy we found a place that makes food like our moms used to!!!

WOW! Completely amazed by this place. You need prescription glasses fixed, THIS IS YOUR PLACE! My father has glasses from a designer that are hard to find. He accidentally sat on them snapping the frame arm off. Since the glasses are frameless frames, this was a difficult repair. We have searched high and low to replace the arm but in the end we choose to have the arm lazer soldered back on. Amazingly he also could have replaced the arm since he carries this unusual brand! I will forever use this place and recommend it to anyone and everyone!

Our fav location! Always has a great selection of all things target. For the most part I never have an issue in this store but it's always difficult when there are NO sales people on the sales floor. They always have quick check out (love) and plenty of carts. I will always drive farther just to use this location.

I have to say that this is not my go to store but in the end I always wind up here and find what I'm looking for. Their selection of dresses and swim suits are great and after searching other stores I usually find my purchases here. The store is usually kept organized and clean. Customer service lacks here and usually what they have out it what they have. No back stock. I dislike having to be let into a dressing room. When I'm ready to try on stuff, I shouldn't have to wait on someone to let me in a room or go hunt someone down. Security shouldn't be an issue since I'm sure cameras are everywhere. I wish they carried a more generous return policy, it would sway me more to be my go to store.

This place has EVERYTHING Thing related! I am local to this business and have walked in sometimes to save the shipping. The office where you can purchase is just an office, there is no showroom or displays. They give great advise and don't get pushy to make a sale. Their yard has old VW's and some electric items. If you are unsure what you need, call, they are super helpful!!!

I really love this place. Upon walking in we were promptly greeted and since we made a reservation we were seated almost right away. The place has a Mexican flair in decor and a nice cozy feel. Our service was quick and our server was super attentive. I ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp and I couldn't finish it! Food was hot and fresh. I am not a fan of those computers on the table and was grateful when the server suggested removing it. I will defiantly return since the food is always delish and superb service.

For a Calif pizza kitchen this one is nice. Clean interior. We were greeting promptly and seated. Our server greeted us and made suggestions. I ordered the spinach and mushroom flatbread. It was light and tasty. Service was good however the deodorizer for the bathrooms was overwhelming. I could smell it once I was about 50 yards from restroom. Once I got into the restroom I thought I would puke due to the noxious smell. I quickly did my business and used my hand sanitizer instead of spending another minute in the restroom for fear of seeing my lunch come back up. It will quite a while before I come back to this location. The smell of the restroom ruined my meal. Bleck....

Fun and elegant happy hour! Lite bites and also a glorious wine list! Service was quick and assistive. Patio was lit with heaters for warmth on a chilly night. I had the carpaccio and baked brie which were fab! Both were tasty and would definitely order again. Wine was served in proper glasses and so many to choose from. It is a pricey place but a superb place for an elegant happy hour

Cute quaint place. About a dozen or so tables and booths. Also a small sushi bar for about a dozen or so people. We came for a late lunch. It wasn't busy at all! Was greeted promptly and seated in a nice booth. We ordered the lunch special. You can choose how much or little you want. Very appealing! The vegetable tempura was light and crisp, not greasy at all. All the sushi we ordered was fresh light and delicious! Our waiter was attentive and helpful. The chicken teriyaki was moist and tasty. Think we've found a new place for sushi!

A must stop on any ride home from up north. The pies are to die for and the food is delish. Ordered the hot dog and it was super yummy. Right amount of "stuff" on my dog and lots of AZ history here. Service isn't super quick here but worth the wait.

Luv luv luv SWA! For me and most all of my friends it's the only way to travel for domestic flights. They have an almost perfect safety record and always fly the same type of jets so mechanically speaking they are doing things right! Great to not have to pay to check my bags and it's usually reasonably priced. Employees always seem friendly and happy to help.

This little gem is a great find! The food is fresh, no microwaves and super delicious. It was around lunch when I visited and the parking lot was full. Inside the place was busy but not overly busy. We were seated right away. Decor inside was nothing to really speak of but the food is the main attraction here. I had the "not guilty your honor" a fabulous choice. It came with a bowl of soup, today's soup was Italian wedding ball. The soup was so close to my grandmothers it was scary. Yes, it's 108 degrees outside but it was so good I had to eat every drop. The wrap was moist, fresh and super tasty. It was enough to fill me but not leaving you with that over stuffed feeling. From other dishes that were walking by and pics I've seen here, I most definitely will be back and I will tell others this IS the spot for lunch. Sadly it's too far from me to experience breakfast.

I really feel this is the worst Walmart I've ever been in. Displays are always in disarray and limited check out clerks. The store always seems dirty and the produce is always "ugly". From now on I will drive to the farther Walmart. I'm not a frequent Walmart shopper as Walmart is my "last resort".

Awesome selection of all campers! Nice indoor showroom. Sales people were nice and not overly pushy. Kudos! I was happy that we were able to "try" the sleeping arrangements since my husband is a tall man. Most showers he can't even stand in. This made it easier to decide what camper would work best for us. Now the challenging part, money.

We sat out on the patio for a beautiful afternoon lunch. Sandwiches were tasty. Service was slightly on the slow side. Limited menu, thought there would be more choices for lunch. Most menu items were repeated but you could choose hot or cold. We enjoyed ourselves and would recommend this place for a nice lunch downtown any time.

The Udon at Sushi Eye has to be the very best in the Valley. The food is always superb and fresh. It is slightly on the expensive side but ALWAYS worth it. We love the Atkins roll and the Vegan roll. If we could afford it, we would eat there EVERY night!!!

Excellent place for breakfast! When you walk in the place is one big room. Booths separate the center of the room with tables all around. We were there for late breakfast so it was not crowded at all. Service was quick, attentive and courteous. I was most impressed with the fresh fruit. Most places cut fruit early so some dry out of get slimy. This fruit was none of those thing! It was on the cheap side even though we ate healthy. Great decor inside! Will def come back!

Wow! What a place for surgical  procedures! First off no one here has any kind of contagious issues. The places is clean and tidy and has no "hospital" smell. Secondly, the staff! I can't praise this place enough. The patients advocate Danny is awesome. He kept us informed and was so patient and kind. All the nurses and doctors are super gentle and kind. Everyone seemed to have their own room to recover in as well. Only drawback is there is no place to eat within the facility but many choices around that deliver.

We LOVE this place! Always friendly service. Appointment setting is also easy. The doctors assistants are just as knowledgeable as the doctors. The office is always clean and kept up to date. I've been taking my 13yr old to this office from the day she was born and the office staff is always helpful. (Was informed of her last wellness apt and they let me know insurance might not cover since it hadn't been a full year) THATS SERVICE! The office is decorated in a sweet way making all who visit feel comfortable. I adore they way they have always spoken to my child, age appropriately. You can't go wrong her with your children!

We come to this location quite frequently. Service is always quick and friendly. Sometimes there is a line out the door so plan wisely. Store is small, not a ton of places to sit. This location always seems clean and well stocked. No matter how busy they get, the employees are still friendly and offer tastes of different ice cream. Will always return here!

I used to LOVE this office. Staff was super friendly and very helpful. Now since its been taken over by East Family Medical, it's THE PITS! I've been coming her for many many years. Today I had to fill out paper work as if I was a new patient, ok, I get that. They requested that I come A HALF HOUR before my appointment... Um hello, you have all my history and now I'm sitting here after filling out paper work for 20 mins waiting. Thanks for wasting my time! If it wasn't for Mrs Rivera (best one in the office) I would have walked out! I also found out they let one of the girls who takes vitals go because she was "too big" ( they also do weight loss) and now the girl doing vitals is bigger than the nice one they let go... Guess I'm on the hunt for a new doc! I would have given no stars but I adore mrs Rivera....

STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS OFFICE! They go through doctors like water! They state that you can trust them with your acute medical issues but they are NOT to be trusted. Once your doctor leaves this office no one will refill your prescriptions! And if you have an acute issue like I do, you have to go back and see another doctor even if it's only been a couple of months since your last visit. Apparently there are no other qualified doctors in this office that can read your medical file to assist you. I've been with this office for years and refuse to be treated this poorly. If you value your health, don't come to this office.

I drive past another Frys to shop at this location. The store is clean, well organized, always has fresh flowers, fresh sushi and great customer service. I would have given this location 5 stars but the woman in the bakery who took my order, could have spoken and understood English better or she shouldn't be talking orders. I asked for specific designs and this woman told me the cake decorator would call me the day my order was due to be picked up. No phone call so I called to check on my order. I was reassured that everything was fine, my order was actually ready for pick up. When I asked what design was on this order I was told that I told the woman who took my order asked to leave room above the writing for pom poms (it was a cheer cake). I DID NOT EVER SAY THAT! I asked for pom poms made from frosting. This was not conveyed to cake decorator. Poor communications make for errors. Thank goodness it wasn't that big of a deal but someone need to not let that woman take orders any longer.

We stopped in here in the afternoon before heading over to the TalkingStick area to see a concert. What a waste! Service was extremely slow, we asked several times for information on happy hour and finally had to look it up on our phones. People were being served before us, UGH! Sad part was that it wasn't busy, we were one of 3 tables on the patio. The interior had nothing to offer as far as decor.  Drinks took forever! We were trying to avoid a chain establishment and crowds of people and we found it here but the lack of everything will keep us from returning.

This is your typical Calf Pizza. Interior is larger than it looks from the exterior. We arrived after lunch so the place was slow. Our server was quick to greet us and took our order. The menu is extensive with choices and everything always looks so good. Today I went with the mushroom spinach flat bread. It arrived quickly and it was crisp but moist. Next time we visit Tempe Market Place we will return!

One of my fav places for good Mexican food. Authentic music playing and it always smells like something wonderful is cooking. The interior is decorated with nostalgic Mexican and gives a slight feel of Mexico. Their menu is plentiful with choices and everything can be modified to your own tastes. Be sure to have some nopalito in your burrito!!! Employees are super friendly and always happy! Burritos are big and one is almost too much for one person. This is my go to place for burritos!!!!

This is my go to place for mani, pedi, waxing, etc. They are professional, CLEAN, courteous and will do what ever they can to accommodate you. Since they do this sometimes it is difficult to just walk in for services. (only drawback) They just recently expanded into the spa area and have yet to try "that side" of their business. Their polish choices are overwhelming and plentiful. I've watched to make sure all implements are properly sterilized and sanitized as well as the equipment. (I used to be in this business) The prices are a little on the high side but well worth it. My only complaint is that they should serve mimosas or bloody Marie's on Saturday and Sunday's. Tee hee

One of the best sushi places in our part of town. Walked in on a Saturday night, seated immediately and on the cute patio too! We had the mussels that were OUT OF THIS WORLD! I ordered misago w quail egg. Quail egg and misago were fresh and super tasty. The Honmachi chip was light, delicate but most of all delicious! I wished there were 4 instead of 3! We tried a new one tonight, the chimichanga roll. We were wow'ed! A nice roll and no rice! Saw all you can't eat on Sunday/Monday. Definitely will return!

First off, the floor is covered with peanut shells. Barrel of peanuts as soon as you walk in the door. We called ahead and was seated within 10 mins of our arrival. Hostess sat us, never saying that the menus were at the end of the table. While reviewing the menu all the servers stopped and started clapping and dancing. Um, hello? Your place is packed and you have time for this? Ewe. This places is loud ! You can hardly hear other people at your own table talking! The table next to us was sat about 5 mins after we were and they got their drinks and we still have not gotten ours. It seems the hostesses like to yell and shout when a new comer arrives. I'm guessing that's what the shouting was about. The house salad was light and fresh. Nice topping on the salad as well. Rib eye arrived perfectly seasoned and cooked to my perfect temperature. It was slightly fatty but delish! Veggies were steamed perfectly and not mushy. All and all the food was great the ambiance is not my cup of tea. Next day, after our visit, diarrhea all day. Yeah. I won't be back.

I'm sad to be writing this review. When I worked days I would stop at this location at least 3 times a week. The place was always clean and the employees were always super friendly. I quit working days a few months ago and was in the mood for my fav smoothie, aci berry boost. I've had this SO many times and was excited for another. The smoothie that I got this visit was a watery mess. It was SO thin in consistency and lacked the usual taste of my smoothie. I was in a rush and didn't realize how bad this smoothie was until I was a few miles away from them. It seemed there is new workers and possibly new management. I am hoping to find a new smoothie place as I will not be back.

Welp what can I say ? I'm beyond disappointed in this place. They've always had a great Easter and Mothers day brunch, until this year. They did raise the prices over the years, understandable. Prices went from 32.50 a head for the brunch to 50 a head but they got rid of all the delicious dishes!!!Last year this place seemed to be going down but this year it's hot rock bottom, THE ABSOLUTE WORST. The room remains decorated the same as always (hint, time to update your decor) bowls glued to the wall, really ??? Hash browns with motz cheese were beyond burnt. The short ribs, burnt and dry. No leafy salad either. Deserts were super sweet. No one manned the omelet bar. Service by the busers, HORRIFIC! Thank goodness we had a great server. Sadly though the server could not help with the poor quality and poor preparation of their food. We will NOT BE RETURNING.

I love this location.  The sales people are EXTREMELY helpful. Store is on the larger size and arranged very stylishly. Typical VS/Pink store. Make sure you download their app for the beat deals and freebies!!! This trip we scored a free neoprene bag to hold wet bathing suits! Pay attention to signs to get your best deals. I do wish there were more dressing rooms. Weekends there can be a line to get into a dressing room. Pack your patience!

I love this Mexican place! The street tacos are awesome! The entrance is through the patio. Nice sized patio with misters to keep it cool. You then enter into an outdoor space that is covered before entering into the actual building. Everything is decorated like old Mexico, bright colors and they also have a tv over their large fire place. The menu is easy to read and servers make great suggestions if you are uncertain. They have cornhole, big jenga and pool tables in the building part. You can come with your kids during they day and they will be entertained! The margaritas are tasty and they offer several different types of margs. A definite cheap lunch spot.

I come to this location quite often. It's always busy in the morning.. Duh! The inside is smallish and looks like every other Dunkin. I do have to say the service is always friendly. I'd like to shout out to Casey who was working the counter this morning. The line was out the door and the drive through line was about 10 cars long. Casey was smiling, friendly and asked all the right questions for each guest with patience. Love when the customers experience is most important! Way to go Casey!

This spot is fab! Fun industrial interior, micro brews are everywhere! There are always daily specials and everything is made fresh to order. Breakfast is my choice meal here. Choosing the ingredients for my breakfast sandwich I get exactly what I was craving. It's a little loud inside but their patio is a haven. Tucked away from the traffic of 48th st, fireplaces and spacious areas to dine or just hang out and enjoy. If you love oatmeal, THIS IS YOUR PLACE! A def MUST in the Tukke for any meal or gathering spot

Pleasant office staff. Clean well organized office. Short wait to see doctor even though I had paper work filled out. This office had a person on site to draw blood. That's very convenient! Doctor was nice efficient and easy to talk to. I was searching for a new doctors office and I've found it! The entrance is in the back and glad I took a second look to find it. The doctor ran the gamut of tests and feel save and secure there.

I have to say this store has a huge selections of boots. They don't always have all styles in all sizes but it is a little overwhelming on how many you have to choose from. Store was clean and well organized. All boots staged by size and a ton of kids boots too. Salespeople were very friendly and attentive. Anything western wear, you'll find here.

This Boot Barn (no longer Sheplers) is a great store. Large, spacious store! It's nice to be able to shop with out backing into another customer or to have to "trade places" because there is not enough for 2 in an isle. Fab selection of boots, worth me driving to this location instead of their closer location to my home. Everything western is here and many many selections to choose from!

A great place for a quick 3dollar outer wash. 20bucks gives you the works. You get to vacuum your own car so it's clean to your satisfaction. Not a fan of the dressing on the inside dash, it tends to attract more dust. The employees are friendly and so a decent job on the inside when you get the works.

Love love love this place! The GRITS are to die for! Southern home made grits. The interior leaves a little to be desired however the food makes up for the lack or over pour of decor. The menu offered a lot to choose from. Wait staff is always friendly and will always take the time to help you decide what to order. Always a hit when we eat here!

I enjoy shopping here for all things foreign to my American upbringing. Isles are crowded, over loaded with all sorts of products. Their fish is ALWAYS fresh! I will make the extra drive from LeeLees to here since LeeLees has gone down hill. Most don't speak English at this location which sometimes makes for an exciting discovery of some new food.

We came for dinner tonight. The restaurant was quite dark, too dark to see the menu. Nice atmosphere, nice wine list. The service was excellent, quick and attentive. We were a large party and were seated right away with a reservation. We all had flat breads to start with cocktails. The goat cheese and artichoke flatbread was excellent but the lobster was just ok. I had a pomegranate margarita/martini that was excellent. I ordered the tuna tartar and it was good, was not expecting the avocado underneath. The rack of lamb was cooked to perfection however it could have used a little more seasoning. All in all we had a great time and the food was good.

We were very excited when they started to renovate this bar. Sadly it was all for nothing. This place has horrifc food. I tried to speak to a "manager" but all feel on deaf ears. The service was poor and the food, well, it shouldn't be called food. I tried to follow up on their Facebook page only to find my post deleted instead of addressed. I would advise staying clear of this place. :(

Great place for downtown. Interior was open and interesting. The menu left something to be desired. Don't get me wrong, the food was delicious but the menu was limited. I ordered the scallops with sweet potato wrapped in bacon. It was so tasty but there was no side dish. For the price of this dish there should have been a ton of the snap peas on this plate. For desert I ordered the salted caramel which was so good but it was runny inside. Next time we will come in just for wine and the meat/cheese platters that they offer. You can choose your cheeses and different meats to accompany your wine and nosh.

I visit this store quite frequently for my Verizon needs. The store is laid out nicely and it keeps customers busy when the store is busy and I have seen this store quite busy. Today we came in for an upgrade on my daughters phone. Sadly she wasn't eligible but we got Patrick B as our customer service assistant while in the store. My father has Parkinson's and a smart phone was not serving him well. Through the magic of Patrick I was able to walk out with a simple flip phone for my dad but also upgrades to mine and my daughters phone! And a tablet to boot!!!! Patrick did his very best to assist us in getting the best deal for our specific situation. I couldn't believe how great Patrick was! He consulted with his manager for special deals and helped my dad get a simple phone. He even brought out a flip phone that wasn't on display yet! I have had horrible customer service at this store but Patrick has redeemed my faith in people helping people. Great experience! Thank you Patrick!

This place is always clean and has a super friendly staff. The food is cooked to order and have yet to get an incorrect order. Which seems to be a rarity in most fast food places. The interior is well laid out with tv's to watch your fav sporting or children's programming. The line gets quite long for drive through so being your patience in the drive through. Be sure to try the plethora of ice cream flavors !! Most made fresh!! Yummy!!!

The fresh mozzarella is to die for! Being a Jersey girl I know the real thing and this is the REAL thing! I could see into the kitchen and watched the cook making nice big balls of mozzarella. I asked if we could take balls to go and unfortunately they don't sell it that way. We had the mozzarella and tomato on Focaccia bread and the tomato and mozzarella salad. Both were moist and mouth watering! We loved it so much we  ordered a plain pizza to go. The pizza was cooked on a beautiful wood burning stove but it was just ok. The pizza was sort of dry and disappointed it wasn't better since this seems to be their speciality. The interior of this place is super cute and the back dining room was even more cute. Shabby chic is the decor and it fit perfectly. Almost felt as if we were in someone's home. Service was quick and prompt. Would have given 5 stars if the pizza was better.

Love love love this place. Since everything is used or refurbished they don't always have exactly what your looking for but you will find something close. MAC's, iPads, etc are nicely priced, well checked out and a great find for used Apple products. Customer service is superb and employees are very knowledgable about their products and stock. Will continue to visit this place for all my MAC needs!

The food is fabulous here! I had the chicken limone and it was super light and filling. Others at our table had pizza, pasta and one had a calzone. Everything was spectacular EXECPT the service. Service was more than slow, it dragged, which made our meal awkward. Drinks took forever and appetizers came out with our meal.  It would have been 5 stars if the service was better.

This was my first float. I enjoyed my float but next time I will not do ear plugs since my breathing with ear plugs kept me from relaxing. The silence was nice but would have preferred my own meditation music. It was relaxing and freeing of mind and body! I DEFINITELY will be back!

We made a reservation for an early Tuesday evening. SCORE! It's 5 buck burger night! Upon entering this location there is a sign saying seat yourself. No one greeted us and through some weird on goings a server moved people who were sitting at our reserved table. No big. The room is open and loud. The decor is young and hip. Bar is in the center of the room with many tvs over the bar. Booths, high top tables and regular tables. Misters for the patio but it's June and it's way too hot to sit out there. The place was busy and we were a large party. I ordered the Fried Louie. Since we were a large party, our order got split into two tickets which came out at two different times. Not convenient but it worked. My burger came and it took me forever to ask for a side of mayo. By the time I got my mayo, I cut my burger, well done. BLECK. As soon as I returned my food to the runner our waitress, Angelina, came back to reconfirm my order. She was just as patient she could be with us. Being a large party with all her other tables, she was rockin it. My burger finally arrived once everyone else was done eating. WOW! What a great combo of egg yoke to burger!  Wished the lettuce was a leaf and not shredded tho...  Seems like a great spot to hang with friends and have a few drinks!

Wow! Great place for a quick wash. Lots of options to choose from and you get to vacuum your own car. BONUS! They give you a heavy duty cloth to wipe the inside of your car as you go through the wash! Nice attendants too!

I've been here before, many times. The food is not consistent. Some days, AWESOME, others, icky. It's is on the expensive side but there aren't many places in the valley that offer such a great happy hour! And the beer selection is always to die for! The interior have a movie theme guessing since they are so close to the AMC. I do know that each place is decorated differently. The dinning room is large and open which sometimes can make it loud. Their patio is also quite large. Happy hour is half priced apps and half price drinks. Skip the dinner and do happy hour here. It's your best deal.

I've been dying to try this place and today was the day.  The place was bright and clean, always a good sign. The menu was clear and simple. I ordered the large carne asada quesadilla. The salsa, the guacamole and chips were delish! Sadly they do NOT offer sour cream at all. My quesadilla was $8 and def not worth the price. Not only was the meat burnt but there was hardly any cheese in my quesadilla.... Def won't be back

Love this location. It's inside the Safeway and there is hardly ever a line. The employees are super friendly and helpful. Their stations are always clean and every employee is always smiling. EVEN EARLY IN THE MORNING!  I love that they have samples to try so you can always try new things.

Adore this place! My old dentist retired. I did a lot of research trying to find a new dentist. Love that this a family run office and not a corporation. The office staff is super friendly and extremely knowledgable. The dentists and their assistants are kind, gentle and very caring. Happy to say I've found the perfect dentist!

I visit this location most often. You have to be buzzed in past two doors. The place is clean and well organized. Their selection of ediatlbes is extensive, including sodas. The budtenders are friendly and helpful. It nice to be able to ask someone why they think of certain products. Third flower selection usually has what I'm looking for however this location does not sell any devices to assist you in using their product, the only down fall of this place. You collect points for making purchases and then you can use your points toward products. Very cool. Their pre rolls are nice and burn quite well.

I can't remember what this places used to be back in the day. Sadly it looks exactly the same as it did back then only no one took care of it. Being on the lake is nice. Beautiful views. The interior lacked the "umph" needed for a place with such a great view. Wobbly tables, the lack of decor and the plethora of dust and cob webs that line the ceiling give this place a dumpy feel. My husband wanted pretzel bites w their own cheese and they tasted as if they were microwaved and the cheese tasted as if it came straight from the can. I had the fresh ahi tuna on top of a salad. The seared tuna was "seared" black. Hardly seared if you burn it. It tasted like bad stinky feet. My husband had the shepards pie and you really can't go wrong there. We also ordered the brownie sundae and it was beyond sweet for me. All and all, not the best place I've eaten in but certainly not the worst. I would come back but will never come back again on date night with my husband.

WOW! I think we found our new spot for breakfast and lunch. This place is located in downtown Chandler. The name refers to the character Wimpy from Popeyes who always asks for a burger that he would pay for on another day. We had hotdogs and they were delicious! I had the Mac and cheese chili dog and my husband had chili cheese dog. Amazing chili and inexpensive too! Next time we will do the burgers and hope to get up early enough one morning to catch breakfast. LOVE LOVE that this is not a chain or Corp business. It's small inside and also a place to eat outside. We DEFINITELY will be back!!!!

Came here because of a tip from Daphne Monroe, Smart Shopper. Wow was she right! Specifically for the bridal area. TONS of bridal and occasion dresses. Men's tux jackets, kids too! I will shop here now for occasion dresses! YES! Be prepared to hunt and pick. Most occasion dresses are arranged by color, helpful but should be arranged by size instead.

Great place for a cheap exterior wash! Watch for attendants, they are not much help. Kids love driving through the wash! I love the fact that you get to vacuum your own car too. They also offer air lines to blow the rest of the water off you car but you have to do it yourself.

First time to this place. It was in between lunch and dinner so there was hardly anyone there. Interior is slightly worn. You get in line and order off the menu boards behind the counter. Food was good, soup was fab! After ordering you get a number and choose your own table. A server will deliver you food to your table. I recommend this place for winter in Phoenix!

I was lucky enough to have a realtor who knew all about Jeremy and his staff. I'm so grateful she put us together. From the very first step to the very end, this team kept me informed and helped me to be a part of the process on getting a mortgage. We did a VA loan and thought we'd hit bumps but this team was there to explain it all and make it go smoothly. Most importantly made me feel secure in handling my personal information. Things were done on time and if I ever had to call, I got a prompt response. I've had mortgages before but this was so painless and almost effort free! I will never ever use another mortgage lender ever again!

I was very impressed with this place. The inside looks just like it did when NYPD was there, new paint and new tables. It's a small place so it can get loud. Menu was a plethora of choices and I chose the BLTA, blt w avocado. Super yummy and the focaccia bread was light and tasty. I love that you can choose sweet potato fries! Service was attentive and friendly. Will def be back!

This location used to be owned by a mom and pop from Brooklyn and they made the best pizza. Too bad most Phoenicians do not know what good pizza is! The interior is interesting, a little fake NY if you ask me. However the pizza is good. Nice thin crust, fresh motz ( you have to ask for it)  and fresh ingredients. Upon entering you are greeted by large menu signs. It felt somewhat like a subway restaurant in that you walk down the line, following your pizza with employees asking what you would like to add to your pizza. The employee looked at me strangely when I asked for olive oil instead of sauce and then proceeded to put butter on the crust. I had to correct the employee, butter is WAY different than olive oil! No biggie. I had them add fresh mozzarella, fresh spinach, sautéed mushrooms and capacola. Wow! I'm from Jersey and my dad threw pies for all of this life and this was GOOD! Almost as good as my dad used to make. A definite place to return!!

Excellent food and fab service is what gets the 5 stars! Inside has a surf atmosphere, very open with TV 's everywhere. Menu is slightly confusing but while enjoying an appetizer we figured it out. Our server was courteous and friendly. I had the wings and they didn't disappoint! Big wings, wished the garlic in the Parmesan was slightly stronger. Menu looked to offer lots to choose from. Will definitely return!

A good store for all things upcycled. It's a hunt and pick place so bring your gloves and patience. Everyday the inventory changes depending on what gets donated. While doing a project I try to stop by here at least once a week. Upcycling is the wave of the future and also helps to save money.

I come here just to eat the eggplant. It's so tender and tasty! The deli is tucked away in a strip mall with the Frys grocery store as the anchor. It's a small deli with Italian deli meats and pastries. The menu in located on a chalk board and you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I ordered the eggplant that is almost exactly the way my mother makes it. I noticed the crumb cake in the case and I should have ordered one piece to go. It looked just like REAL crumb cake! More crumbs than cake... I will definitely grab one next time. There is a small out door area that is mostly covered with tables to dine at. We love to come here and I also must say how nice it was for the owner to visit our table to make sure we were doing well. Don't see that in today's world much.

YUM! This place is small but quickly efficient. Their sauce was delish and pasta was cooked to perfection. Don't be afraid to try new things. Expand your taste buds and choose something different and exciting. You can't go wrong with any dish on this menu!

Wow! Superb customer service! This is a small Vape shop in a small strip mall. They have almost every flavor as well. The shop is nice inside. Chairs to try different flavors are up against a bar/table. We were greeting upon entering and my first Vape shop ever. The employees are SUPER nice and extremely helpful. We tried a bunch of flavors and in the end bought a nice all in one vape device. The employees showed how it all came apart and how it all worked. I was grateful for the added extra time and knowledge the employees spent helping me find the right gadgets and flavors. I will definitely be a return customer! Thanks guys!

Unusual entrance, it's on the side of the building. We were greeted promptly and on a Sunday night at 6pm the place was packed. Hostess told us about a 15 min wait for a table and the wait seemed shorter than expected. The place is one large room so the noise level is high. Butcher paper on the tables and plastic bibs, usual seafood stuff. The food came out in drips and drabs but we were told this at the beginning. Natalie, our server was very knowledgable and very courteous. She explained how the menu works. I ordered the dungeons crab. Came out hot and cooked perfectly as ordered. Food was tasty and if you don't mind getting dirty and eating with your hands, this is the place. I asked about happy hour. Would love to see lots of fun oyster shooters there. Will def be back!

This place changes doctors all the time. If you like to see the same doctor do NOT come to this place. I've been going to this office for years, it used to go under the name of Ahwatukee Primary Care. They switched to this East Valley Family Medical and boy what a screw up! I've given more money to this office than I should have. Its a total scam. Want a prescription refilled after you've seen a doc and its been a couple of months, NOPE. No one in the office can read that I have an acute issue and can't go with out my meds. Do I have to see the doc every month to get refills? Apparently! and this is where the scam comes in. They charge your insurance a boat load just for an office visit to get a script refilled. I even know that they fired their nurse for being overweight. The waiting room is a wreck and filthy. Im so glad I was able to find another doctor who actually cares about their patients. Seems they are making more money as a weight loss clinic than a family care office. STAY CLEAR.

So happy that this store opened! I loved it in NY and glad there's one that's finally not that far from my home. The store is laid out in sections to help you find what you need however the customer service agents are beyond helpful if you do need assistance. There is SO much to see it can't be taken in all at once! My daughter who is always organizing her room loved this place.

Fist timer here. Dispensary was beautifully decorated with a large waiting room. As I entered the building a security guard was next to the receptionist. Nice. I felt safe. This was an unreal experience for me. I've never bought legal before. I was nervous and told the employees this and they were super nice and reassuring. I was looking for pain relieve and to be able to sleep with chronic pain. I was shown and smelled a couple of strains. I bought what I thought would help. Vape pen, waste. 50 a cartridge. I sucked on that thing for an hour, off and on, and was still wide awake all night. Less pain but not enough to sleep. I guess it's going to be a trial an error guessing game until I find a strain for me. Oh! Loved there buy one get one for first time customers. DEF BONUS! I wonder if they recycle those little glass jars for a discount off your next purchase. Could be a nice insensitive for return customers.
