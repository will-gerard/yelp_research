I am a real estate agent and have recommended Justin on several of my repairs and monthly service. He is timely and always gets me estimates quickly. Great service and reasonable!

DO NOT GO THERE! Worst customer service! Myself, son and husband all went here for our annual vision screening and to purchase glasses and contacts. EACH TIME, they argued about the co payment and EACH time they had to refund me the co pay because they were wrong. It took FOREVER to get the glasses and then with in 2 weeks my frames broke. IT IS NATION WIDE COMPANY POLICY TO REPAIR OR REPLACE WIHTIN THE FIRST 30 DAYS, regardless of warranty. I even called the national head quarters who contacted the owner twice, no phone call, no repair, NOTHING...
