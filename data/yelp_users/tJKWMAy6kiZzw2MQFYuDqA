we recently tried this vet with our two new kittens and can honestly say I have never been to a vet office with people as genuine, caring, and attentive as the entire staff here. Because of this, we decided pretty quickly we were going to switch to this vet from our old one. I totally trust Dr. Cellers opinion and he thoroughly explains reasons behind any treatment your pet may need. I also love that they post pictures of all the new baby clients on the bulletin board so you can watch how much they grow! Sooo cute! I also have to say that their prices are the most reasonable and competitive I have seen. They even offered to let us pay half of our kitten package upfront and then the rest at a later appointment since we were paying for two kitties. I thought this was very accommodating and considerate since even the most general vet bills can get pricey! Thanks for giving us a home we can trust Desert Hills! Your passion for the care of animals is not only apparent but appreciated!

This is my boyfriend Paden and I's local haunt, which should be a testament to this establishment in itself. We have recently become regulars with one of the servers, Garin, who is nothing short of a spectacular server. If you get him as a server, your experience and service will be unmatched! I'm also posting more recently because of the newer menu changes which are amazing! I would recommend the banh mi (sp?), the truffle cheeseburger, or my favorite, the new lamb burger with fried onions added (fat kid burger fantasies dancing in my head omnomnom). Garin also had me try the Hawaiian mule, which is, as eloquently as I can put it, totally amazeballs. YH makes the ginger beer in the mules in-house and it is soooo good and soooo worth trying! Don't be a square, go check it out!

So my boyfriend and I decided to visit this location after being thrilled with the recent facelift and menu upgrades to the Salty's in Scottsdale. Unfortunately and fortunately, our mediocre at best experience here has also reminded me to leave the Scottsdale location a stellar review (sorry Peoria!).   We went on a Sunday and this place was ghost town dead. At first impression, this place seems like a cool hangout for weekend get togethers, but upon further look, you can definitely tell this place is in serious need of a facelift. The columns are missing chunks of tile, the tables and barstools have seen better days and are falling apart, and one of the tvs we couldn't tell if it was just old or if there was some dried substance running down it. Overall the place just looks dark and dirty. On to the food....  The menu at this location is not the same updated menu from the Scottsdale location but still has similar dishes. We opted for "tableside" guac (our favorite), and the fundido. The appetizers came out lightening fast, which you would think is a good thing, but it was almost too fast. The guac was brought out to us rather than made tableside  and had brown oxidation and oil separated from the dip like it had been sitting out all day. You could tell from the taste as well it was not fresh. The fundido was similar, like congealed velveeta that had been sitting out too long. We also had to separate some chips out from our basket because they were soggy with oil. For entree we shared a 6 taco basket with chicken tinga, grilled steak, the mahi taco, and the breaded fish taco. My boyfriend described the tinga as "alright" and while the flavor of the steak was good, the pieces were minced so small that the texture was unappealing, almost like dog food. The chipotle crema saved the mahi taco but I think the taco was missing avocado slices, I couldnt remember from the menu if that was supposed to be included or not. The breaded fish taco was okay but was missing both avocado and sauce as described which was disappointing. Unfortunately, we're now both at home with upset stomachs, headaches, and nausea :(  On the brightside, our server was nice and checked in on us often. No complaints there. Unfortunately this wasn't enough to convince us to return though; next time we'll probably go back to the Scottsdale location. It's sad, this place has so much potential I feel like they are just not taking advantage of.

Honestly, the only reason I come to this location is because of how close it is to my house but I think I'll have to be finding a new location. My boyfriend and I waited 3 minutes at the order window after being told it would be just a moment, and then another 15 minutes to get our drinks with one vehicle at the pick up window in front of us. Once we got to the window, I got my tea and we had to wait an additional 3 minutes for our fizzio. No apologies for the wait. Unfortunately, I've found that this has become characteristic of this location. As far as the drinks go, my chai was good as usual, but we would not recommend the fizzio. It's not terrible but it does have a bad aftertaste. One star is because customer service really does make or break the experience, and this location seriously lacks quality service. I still love you though Starbucks!

We like the food here and actually go out of our way for the queso, which is why I think they should at least be accurate about the hours they say they are open on Yelp, Google, and their own website. At least update it if it's not consistent with the hours you are ACTUALLY going to be open. One star docked for every hour they said they'd be open tonight and were not. Thanks for the wasted trip.

My boyfriend and I walked in at 9pm....at 9:15 we were finally asked our drink order. 9:20 my boyfriend's beer and my water arrived. We spent the rest of our time waiting for our waitress to come back before deciding to leave at 9:45. We left cash on the table for the beer and walked out - 9:50. My boyfriend realized he forgot his wallet once we got to our car so he had to walk back in to grab it, and still no one said anything to him. For a night that wasn't particularly busy in the slightest, with no tables seated around us, the service left more to be desired. We ended up driving through Portillo's for food after wasting almost an hour here. Our fault for waiting around as long as we did, but annoying nonetheless!

I almost don't want to write a review about this place because I want to keep it our neighborhood's best kept secret. They were recommended to me by my cousin who had been a couple times. They have obvious Scottish and Irish influence and this is a big draw for my family. I decided to try them out for lunch, ordered an iced chai latte and the ham and brie croissant sandwich special. Holy. Balls. The best chai I've ever had (and they'll make it dirty if you like), and I was honestly sad when the sandwich was gone. The owner and chocolatier was so friendly and offered me a free chocolate since it was my first time. She brought me the cinnamon rum milk chocolate. I don't typically like cinnamon chocolate but this was exceptional. I'll probably pick up a few of these specifically next time I go back. The other woman who came in had a lavender dark chocolate, which sounds delicious.   I also like that you can tell how fresh and homemade everything is, and they're not skimpy with the sandwich fillings. My sandwich was loaded with thick cut black forest ham and big hunks of brie. I also lime that they mayo both sides of the sandwich, it's the little things that count. I don't typically like ham either but this was well worth the gamble! I'm sooo soo sooo looking forward to going back!

I have to say, I love my Paradise Bakery on the reg, but I can honestly say this is the first time I've been severely disappointed. The customer service here is deplorable. We came in to order dinner to go; the boyfriend ordered an easy ham and cheese sammich, no problems there. I ordered a pick two, southwest chicken caesar and a frontega chicken on ciabatta, the gal tells me they're out of ciabatta, no problem, I'll take it with the foccacia it usually comes on. She says all they have is the asiago foccacia, close enough, I'll take it. The girl seemed really rushed and gave us our total twice before we were even done ordering. We went to go get drinks (side note, all the tea except for hibiscus was out, argh!) and the sandwich gal comes up and tells me they're out of the asiago focaccia. I asked her if I could do the chicken salad sandwich instead and she looked at me confused. I found on the menu it's actually referred to as the "chicken walnut" so that's my bad I guess. They brought our order out and we checked our bag, no salad. I went up to the girl that rang us up and advised her we were just missing our salad and she looks at me confused and asks, "salad?" And I said yes, my pick two chicken caesar, she asked the salad person if she made it and they replied no, and asks me if I wanted it for here or to go. Why would I want everything to go except my salad?  Anyways, cut to getting home and there's no chicken in my southwest chicken caesar. At this point, I'm aggravated. I go to find the always included cookie to numb the pain, and low and behold the cookies are also missing, despite being included on our receipt.   We love Paradise but unfortunately we will not be returning to this location, despite the closer drive.

After we moved into our new rental, my boyfriend and I were looking for a pest control company, just for regular servicing. We shopped around a bit and Insectek was by far the most helpful with all my questions, had the most competitive pricing, and had the best solution to keep away all those pests that was all safe for all our pests!  Caleb comes out to service our house and he is AWESOME. He's always very sensitive to my bug phobia and took the time to remove the unwanted spidery friend that had decided to camp in my garage this week. He is extremely knowledgeable and always takes the time to explain to me what he is doing and why, makes sure to ask if I have any particular concerns, and pays close attention to removing any evidence that buggy comrades ever existed in my house (LOVE that!). Though, that's been few and far between these days since Caleb has been coming out!  He and Insectek have also always been very kind and always said if there are any issues or bug intruders that we can call and let them know immediately, and that he'd typically be in the area, and he is! I see him in our neighborhood servicing some of our other neighborhood homes as well, so it's nice to know that if I ever need to be THAT girl (don't worry guys,I doubt it, but ya never know!), I can flag Caleb down the street and he'll save the day!  It's hard to find quality customer service nowadays, but these guys have it down. If you're looking to hire a regular pest solution company, look no further! You won't be disappointed.

This place is amazing! It has become a haunt of mine and my boyfriends. They have great drinks, great happy hour, great tacos, and quesadillas that I'm pretty sure are made with voodoo magic because they're AMAZING. Beyond that, the service is always excellent and the staff is so welcoming.   We come specifically for Jeremy who mixes amazing drinks and provides the best experience every time. If he's not around Karn always takes such great care of us!  Overall, great crew and always a fun, laid back time. A must check out!

My boyfriend and I came here a couple weeks ago to try out the new location and were so impressed! Our server Annie (? Sorry if I got your name wrong girl!) was phenomenal and uber friendly. She went above and beyond to recommend drinks and food and make sure out visit was exceptional. We also enjoyed the new, simplified menu. The rockfish and chicken tacos were amazeballs and the recommended torta was just as good. I thought their fried pita chips with cilantro hummus was a cool twist and I couldn't get enough. Tableside guac was so good we scraped the bowl and my boyfriend went to town on the fundido with chorizo. The margarita she recommended was so refreshing and definitely left me 'floating' as promised. I cant remember the name but it was something made with don julio silver and lavender infusions, an unlikely but delicious pairing.  The new atmosphere is light and fun, definitely a cool hangout for a lazy Sunday afternoon. We'll definitely be back!

Really good NY style pizza. We got a half pepperoni half sausage as well as an order of the garlic cheese bread and both were great but I'd have to say the crust was my favorite part of both (which says a lot because these are usually the pieces we toss aside!). Prices are far more reasonable than chain pizza places for far better quality. Delivery was also exceptionally fast and the staff was extremely helpful and nice. We're super stoked to have a great pizza joint in our neighborhood.  Unrelated but I'm not sure why two reviews were necessary for the 'metal mishap?' All new businesses make mistakes/learn along the way and I'm sure this was a one off miss. No need to destroy their rep on Yelp right out the door. Don't let one bad review stop you from trying this place and supporting small business in our neighborhood!

Why close far before your listed hours? So frustrating....they have a sign on their door that clearly says "NEW HOURS" mon-thur until 9 pm, fri-sat until 10pm and sunday until 8pm. We showed up at 8:15 pm on a monday and all the lights are off, chairs stacked on tables, totally closed. We like the food but if you are unreliable and don't even stay open during your listed hours it's so frustrating and unfortunate. We've been more patient about other shortcomings other people have mentioned that we have also experienced (mopey employees, soda machine being out, cleanliness issues) because there are always going to be growing pangs and a learning process with any new place, but at this point it just seems like bad business practices, especially for a newer establishment.

I can't say enough good things about Pam! I've pretty much always given her free reign on my hair, I trust her THAT much! She has taken me from blonde to brunette, long to chopped, and I've loved it every single time. I've made the mistake of 'cheating' on her before and seriously paid the price, and even then she took me back and fixed me right back up, leaving me healthy and gorgeous again! You won't regret seeing her!
