A huge thank you to Brian at Firestone! Yesterday evening I came into the shop ten minutes before closing. They put my spare tire on for me and had me setup to get a new tire in the morning. I got there at 7am and by 7:10am this morning I had a new tire and was off to work. Brian was friendly, quick and efficient. Before going to Firestone I had called Discount Tire to only get rudeness and a lot of sighs about them closing in 15 minutes. Thank you Brian for your awesome customer service! I will always choose Firestone over Discount Tire!

I went into the store to buy a headlight that had burned out. Eric T was beyond amazing. He found the light I needed quickly and then offered to put it in. It wasn't an easy fix. He had to remove my battery etc just to get to it. He was happy to help and put it in for me. It took about 30 minutes and he was awesome.  Amazing customer service.  Eric T was knowledgeable and went above and beyond!  Thank you again!!!!!

I had the pleasure of dining her for my mom's Christmas party. The atmosphere is casual and comforting,  everything you want in a smokehouse. I had the prime rib. It was cooked to perfection and seasoned perfectly. It also came with this creamy horseradish sauce that was delicious!  I also had a baked potato which came with the standard butter but also sour cream that was topped with chives. I also hit the salad bar which was just your normal iceberg. They also had romaine and big selection of potato salad, pudding and all kinds of random yummys. The dressings were homemade which always makes a big difference for me in the ranch department.  The service was excellent,  never had to hunt down a bartender or server for an extra napkin or drink. I will definitely be back. A gal in our party had the brisket lasagna and I had some major food envy. I'll be back to give it a try.

My appointment was at 8am. I was told to arrive 15 minutes early which I did. It is now 9:30am.... An hour and 45 minutes since I arrived and I have still not seen the doctor, only a student. I am extremely disappointed. I also filled out all of my initial new patient forms online but was told I still had re fill out the exact same forms...again. Literally about to just walk out.
