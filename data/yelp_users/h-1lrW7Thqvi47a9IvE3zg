My most favorite bagel EVER is at Ess-a-Bagel in NYC. Obviously, I can't run down the street and get one of those whenever I want, so I'm continuously on the hunt for a substitute here in Phoenix. We decided to try Big City Bagels because it's close to our new house and I was hoping I'd finally find THE bagel. While it was good, it was nowhere close to my favorite (alas, I will have to keep looking). I did like that the bagels were small. While some may not feel the same way, I feel like bagels are already filling so with a smaller bagel I can get just enough of a fix ;)    The lox tasted fresh, which is a good thing here in the desert, but the BEST thing about this place?? They have jalapeño cream cheese!!! Some bagel places have started carrying it, but not all, so I was happy to find another one that has it. It's the BOMB.COM!  Parking is a little scarce because it's at the back side of a shopping center and it shares the lot with OH-SO, which always seems to be packed.

We came to see Potted Potter on a Saturday night. It was my first time here and I can tell you I won't be back.   First, we get to the parking garage at 7:10 for a 7:30 show and the parking lot is FULL! Not only that, but here charging for parking for an event I already paid for. And since they were full, they had us park on the street curb and STILL charged us!! The lady in charge was out of her mind and needed a Xanax.   Then we look at concessions for a snack and it was the poorest selection of snacks. Chips, bottled water, twizzlers, and chocolate. Great for kids. Not for adults. Blech.   Then we walk into the theater and the little old lady usher says "can I help you find your seat?"  I say "no, I know where they're at". Then she proceeds to snatch my tickets from my hand and start walking towards our seats. So rude! I appreciate old people when they're nice, but jeez lady! Then she feels the need to read our seat numbers to us. Thanks, but I could've done that myself. I know they're usually volunteers and that's great and all, but there's no need for all of that.   Theater is small, but clean, which is why they get 2 stars. Show hasn't even started yet and I'm already not impressed with this place.

While we were waiting for our table, I decided to go get a glass of wine by the bar. There was no bartender at the bar, but someone kept walking back there. 3 times they overlooked me waiting there until they finally asked if I needed something. I wasn't too happy about that since we were already made to wait for a table and there were TONS of open tables. They weren't that busy, so I was a little confused by all of this.   The food was fantastic as usual. I've been to almost every AZ Grimaldi's location at this point (even the original in Brooklyn!) and the pepperoni & jalapeño is just amazing. It's the only pizza I actually crave.   Luckily, our waiter had impeccable customer service skills, so it slightly made up for the initial bad service I received. Still..I had to take off a star for it.

We recently moved out of Gilbert and this is literally the only place I miss. We would come here weekly for their fantastic sandwiches and savory breakfasts. The California Club was always a standout. All of the ingredients taste so fresh and so well put together. And I love that they always put chips on the plate! The selection varies, so you never knew if you were gonna get Fritos or Ruffles that day. The TJ omelet with its chorizo, sour cream, and potatoes was so addicting! My other faves were any of the breakfast sandwiches, the breakfast burrito (must get!), and the turkey havarti sandwich. Really, you can't go wrong with anything you order here.   I haven't tried many of the coffee drinks because once I had the Spanish Latte, I was hooked! It's really better warm, though, so I had to miss out on it during the summer months. But it's so sweet and delicious!  The cupcakes are phenomenal too. Order one. You won't be sorry!  This place is ALWAYS busy (and for good reason). I just wish they had more registers open and more people to help out because the line can hit the back of the restaurant. There never seems to be any urgency in the staff. It's also a little frustrating when you place a pickup order, you have to get in that line to pick up your previously ordered food. So your food could be sitting there for 10-15 minutes just waiting for you to get to the front of the line. Not really convenient when you're in a hurry and just need to grab-and-go. Sometimes the water jug is totally empty and there's no one available to refill it. Hence the need for more help. You have to keep up with the demand!

My FAVORITE restaurant in the Phoenix area. Everything I've eaten there has been on point, well presented, and delicious! I eat red meat well done, but they served a beef tartare roll for their NYE menu and it was to die for!!!  I would seriously ate anything they served me because I can always count on it to be AMAZING! Can't wait to try their Omakase dinner :)

I've been to just about all of the Whole Foods locations in the Valley and this one is by far the nicest. They have every natural/organic/gluten free/special diet item you can think of and the selection of organic produce is outstanding! I feel so blessed to have moved to a home within 10 minutes drive to this place :-)  They also have a great selection of ready-made meals and foods. I can't wait to try out the wine bar and $1 tacos!  The other shoppers can be kinda fancy...I like to go after my workout on Sundays so I feel so underdressed! Haha! It is North Scottsdale, though.... ;-)

I went to Regions Saturday night on a whim when my dinner plans did not work out.  I was pleasantly surprised!  I guess they've gotten a bad rap in the past, but now there is a new chef that definitely knows what he's doing!  I had the fresh fish of the day, which was halibut in a soy butter sauce with homeade potato gnocci.  It was FANSTASTIC!  I'm usually very wary of a restaurant cooking my fish, but it was perfect.  It was smooth, not flaky or fishy, and the sauce and gnocchi were to die for!

Pizzas are delicious. We made our own and ordered a couple off the menu. We created a pepperoni, jalapeño, and pepperoncini, which was fabulous! We like it spicy and it did not disappoint. The crust was perfect! We also ordered the Calabrian, which has Calabrian salami, ricotta cheese, and arugula - this actually ended up being our favorite. SO GOOD! The last one was the Spicy BBQ Chicken pizza, which was eh. I'm already not a fan of chicken on my pizza nor BBQ sauce at all, but I gave it a chance. My husband also placed this one last, so I couldn't be all wrong :-) I would totally come back here again.  They have a garden out front where they grow their own herbs and vegetables, which I admire in a restaurant. So kudos to them for adopting sustainability practices!

Finally got to try this place! My work out studio is in the same shopping center, so I smell the deliciousness every time I get out of a workout (unfair, right?). So the hubs, stepson, and I ventured over last Friday evening. They have a nice outdoor patio area with misters..we almost decided to sit out there, but there was one table left inside so we decided on that instead. I'd love to come back here in the cooler months to sit outside and have a couple of cocktail and a burger.  First off, we ordered the Hell Fire Potato Chips - house made chips drizzled with hot sauce and crumbled bleu cheese. O. M. G. They were crazy good! We wanted MORE hot sauce on them because it was so addicting! We ended up ordering a side of it later on for our fries LOL.  My husband and I split the Lushburger Infusion - beef infused with green chilies & pepper jack cheese w/ a chipotle spread. If you've read my other reviews, you know we like our food spicy, so I had high hopes for this one. It wasn't AS spicy as I would've like it. I couldn't really taste much spice at all, unfortunately. However, the burger was cooked well and the bun was on par, so I was happy. My stepson ordered the Western Burger w/ bacon and BBQ sauce and he seemed to devour it, so I'm gonna assume it was good.   There were a couple of mistakes made with our orders, but our server was more than accommodating. Great service overall. The 80's music they were playing was a bit much. By the end of the meal, I was over it. A little variety might be good, guys...just sayin.  My guys also ordered milkshakes; I was too full to order my own, but I did taste theirs. The Mr. Lushbar (peanut butter and chocolate) tasted like straight peanut butter. I like peanut butter, but not to that extent. The Chocolate Thin Mint was good. It tasted like it had peppermint extract instead of that weird mint flavor I normally taste in, like, mint chocolate chip ice cream.   I signed up for their Lush Club and got a free burger! Have to redeem by Sunday, so I better get there quick!

Oh, iPic, how I love thee! Whether you're sitting in Premium seats (leather armchairs) or Premium Plus (leather recliners w/ all the amenities), it's THE best way to see a movie. Probably not the type of theater you'd go see a movie EVERY time because it'd get a little expensive :-) But on a date night or for a kickass movie you've been waiting to see, this is the place! I'm all about springing for the Premium Plus seats...the difference in cost is worth it for all the perks you get: comped valet parking, free popcorn, reclining seat, blanket & pillow, and wait service. Sign up to be a member and you get a small discount on tickets and a gift card after earning so many points.

Every time I come here the food is amazing. The Serrano-Avocado Shrimp Salad was soooo good. It's toast with an avocado smear, topped with shrimp, arugula, and a honey-lime vinaigrette. To die for! I want another one right now!  The cucumber basil mojito was very tasty and refreshing.   This particular time at the restaurant stood out because of our server, Drew. He had the best personality and was so bubbly and helpful. Happy to answer any and all questions and provided great customer service. Logan was his trainee and he was just as pleasant and helpful as Drew.   The Herb Box is quickly becoming my new favorite spot :-)

Everything from the service to the drinks to the food was amazing!  We had a reservation on a Friday at 7:15. When I fist walked in, I was greeted immediately and Matt (with the pretty blue eyes) escorted us to a nice booth for just the two of us and wished me a happy birthday (we were there to celebrate my birthday).   We ordered the Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn to start. It was freshly popped popcorn with actual bacon pieces on top. Yum. Then we shared the Original Chopped Salad. I crave these things so it was all that I'd dreamed of. My hubby ordered the lam burger for dinner (he said it was really good, but wished he had ordered it well instead of medium well) and I got the Truffled Grilled Cheese Sandwich, which had mashed potato on it (holla!) you could also add chicken or bacon, but I opted for it just the way it was. It was so good!  For cocktails, my hubby had the Beast (tequila cocktail - strong, but with a kick) and I had the Manhattan (strong, but tasty) and the Julep (strong, but sweeter than the Manhattan). They definitely don't skimp on the alcohol and know how to make a good cocktail.   Our server brought out the dessert menu and suggested the bread pudding or the peanut butter bar. We decided to go with the peanut butter bar (chocolate, peanut butter, strawberry jam, white chocolate ice cream). When it came out with no candle, the hubs asked where it was. The server hadn't been told it was my birthday! Pretty blue-eyed Matt had dropped the ball! (Bad Matt, bad). She felt really bad and brought out a candle, which was really very sweet. We then received a visit from the General Manager, Steve. He also felt really bad because they feel a birthday is special and if one chooses to spend it there, then it is a big deal to them. Because of all that, they comped the dessert (birthday dessert is apparently super tiny) and our popcorn AND gave us a $50 gift card to come back and let them make it up to us!   I think they went above and beyond the realm of good customer service and am looking forward to going back. I can't believe it took me so long to go in the first place!  to you, CPH.

100% my favorite place to get pizza in the Valley. I've been to the original in Brooklyn and it has nothing on the ones out here! Pepperoni and jalapeño is the way to go. Haven't ordered anything different in all the years I've eaten here. Yum!

YUH-MEE!  They have great and different flavors of yogurt. And their toppings bar has SO many choices! Good for a quick dessert stop after a meal at Scottsdale Quarter or before a movie at iPic :-)

Dr. Athalye and his assistant(s) are the worst examples of customer service and the medical profession.   I was sad when I learned by beloved GP Dr. Levins would be leaving Scottsdale Family Health, but I was assured I would be in good hands with Dr. Athalye. It has been anything but!   I find him rude and curt...no bedside manner whatsoever. Let me tell you about my most recent experience that has just pushed it over the edge!   I have a prescription for a controlled substance that requires me to actually go into the doctor office to pick up a paper scrip, take it to the pharmacy, and wait for it to be filled. I have to do this every 30 days. Fine. It was time for me to fill a new Rx, so I called Dr. Athalye's assistant and asked for my refill. I picked it up on Friday, took it to the pharmacy, only for the pharmacy to tell me it's not the same one I filled last and they wouldn't be able to fill it anyway because of the way it was written. The on-call service wouldn't page Dr. Athalye for this and it was Friday evening and I was completely out of medication.   So Monday I call again, tell them it was written incorrectly, and ask for the same scrip I had last month. I pick it up, take it to the pharmacy, and it's STILL the wrong one. The pharmacy also tells me that many other patients with controlled substance prescriptions have doctors who write 3 scrips at time for 30 days each and the pharmacy puts a hold on 2 of them until each 30 day time frame passes.  So on Tuesday I call again, tell them it was again written incorrectly to which I receive an argumentative response from the medical assistant. I also ask about the 3-scrip possibility and she tells me they'll write me one scrip for 90 days worth, but not 3 separate ones for 30 days each. HUH??? How does that make sense??? Oh and they'll write it, but she tells me my insurance may reject it. Duh! I ask for just the one 30-day scrip for the same medication I had last time.   My husband goes to pick up the scrip for me (some of us are busy, doctor) and guess what?? It's STILL written incorrectly AND they attach a letter stating he is no longer treating me!!! UN-F*CKING-BELIEVABLE!  So much for good medical care!

I LOVE this place. My friend and I came for AZ Restaurant Week last month and everything was so delicious, I couldn't wait to go back. When another friend of mine suggested Barrio Queen for my belated birthday lunch, i was super down! While I couldn't have their yummy margarita (boo work day), I wholeheartedly enjoyed everything I ate.   The bean dip and chips they provide is solid. Then, of course, you have to order the guacamole! They'll make it as mild or spicy as you want and table side! Big chunks of avocado, freshly chopped peppers, pomegranate...SO GOOD!  My friend ordered the Pozole and seemed really happy with it. I ordered 3 tacos: the Cochinita Pibil (which they're known for), the Relleno, and the Camaron. I love me some shrimp tacos so the Camaron did not disappoint. The Relleno is pretty much carne asada with a roasted jalapeño at the bottom...spicy and fantastic! The Cochinita Pibil is marinated pork and it was so juicy and yom yom yom.  The customer service was also top notch. A woman (possibly the manager) came by and asked my friend if she wanted a to-go container for her Pozole. My friend said yes, but then our waiter came by and took her bowl. When the woman came back with the container, we realized he wasn't taking the bowl to transfer it to the container. The woman felt so bad she offered to have some more made to put in the container. My friend didn't want to put anyone out, so she politely declined. Then the woman offered her guacamole to go, to which she said YES! It was really so kind of her to go above and beyond like that for a simple mistake.   Oh and they surprised me with the Flan for dessert for my birthday and it was BOMB.com. The sauce tasted like coffee...so good, so good.

I've been to Sol a couple times before and the standout items for me have been the Vampiro Taco and the Cucumber Jalapeño Margarita. This time we decided to try their Taco Tuesday. We ordered pretty much one of everything on the Taco Tuesday menu:  Naked Guacamole - very good. But they asked if we wanted more chips since we were out after having eaten them with the salsa and bean dip they bring. Um duh...how else would you like me to eat the guac?? House Margarita - it was good...a little too much sweet and sour mix though. Chicken Street Tacos - bland and dry Carnitas Street Tacos - bland Ensenada Fish Taco - it was supposed to have some sort of sauce on it, which I kept looking for. I've had better. Grilled Fish Taco - my husband had it...he said it was good...idk.  The service was also spotty. We felt like we had to beg for water. There were lots of people working, but it was hard to get anyone's attention. Also, see guac comment above.   This place always seems busy, but I'm just not impressed. I'd go back for a quick Vampiro Taco/Cucumber Jalapeño margarita once in a blue moon, but for the prices they charge here it's just not worth it for a whole meal for me. Sorry, Sol!

After living in Italy for half a summer, I'm very picky about my gelato. I saw that Cool Gelato Italiano was the "best of" in 2014. I was finally able to make my way here and I have to say they meet/exceed my standards. The gelato is flavorful and creamy. The flavor selection is varied enough that it's not overwhelming. I had a small with the Coffee Crunch and the Hazelnut Crunch. I actually tasted coffee and hazelnut. Ottimo sapore!                  My hubby had a medium "After Eight (mint w/ chocolate chip) and Stracciatella. The medium was a lot of gelato but he wished he stuck with the Stracciatella.    I can't wait to come back!

Awesome Moscow Mules! Although, they are a little pricey...go during happy hour when at least they're $4 off :)   The outside patio is nice and cozy, as long as the weather is tolerable. The food is pretty good; however, I always have trouble deciding on something to eat there. Nothing really sticks out for me. But yet I keep going back!   Psst...it's the Mules ;)

I'm not really sure where the bad reviews come from. Gigi's makes some of the best cupcakes in the valley. However, if you like Sprinkles, you won't think so. Sprinkles = plastic vs. Gigi's = sweet flavor. I'm so happy that I finally live close to a Gigi's location...probably not the best for my hips though ;-)  If the ice cream machine is working, get a cupcake shake. They are to die for! Otherwise, all the cupcakes are good. Just pick a flavor (or two) that sounds good and you will be glad you did.

I've been "Karve-ing" for 2 years now and I love it! I think it's such a great workout, especially for women, although my husband finds it equally as difficult. I don't like a lot of the high-impact, lose-your-breath workouts so this is perfect for me. I get toned in all the right places...booty lifted, arms sculpted, thighs shaped. Even after 2 years, the workout is never the same and I actually get excited to go work out!

Cool venue. Lots of space. Boo boo VIP section. Not enough seating. Lots of choices at the bar but too much effort to walk through the crowd and over there, then wait in line. We bought VIP tix but I don't feel there are any real perks...not sure if that's the fault of the concert organizer tho. Venue has major potential. Oh and the bar does accept credit cards contrary to a previous review.

I was very happy with my experience at the Costco car wash. For $7.99 I got a decent drive-through car wash. The guy who was at the start of the car wash even offered to let me go back through the wash if it didn't get all the bugs off my windshield the first time. I've found my new car wash spot!

Huge fan of Jacked Ice! Whether it's "jacked" or sans booze, they have the most creative and delicious flavors. If I ever happen to throw an event, I would definitely consider these guys and their amazing creations.

Good burgers! The classic is delish and the El Diablo is super spicy! I highly recommend the fries with green chile queso. So yummy! As for the milkshakes, I've only tried 2 so far: Nutella with chocolate covered pretzels is amazeballs and the caramel with sea salt just tasted like a vanilla shake with caramel in it. Meh.  I really like that they offer different types of sodas than you're used to seeing, all made with real sugar. Even the ketchup is made with real sugar!  Next time, I'm going for the Llano Poblano burger with roasted poblanos, pepper jack, and chipotle mayo and the Oreo shake! Yes, please!

We had the pleasure of trying Short Leash's dogs at Yelp event and we were not disappointed (thanks, Lindsey D.). My hubby and I shared one and luckily he made good choices when choosing toppings. All of their dogs are served on Naan which is fantastical! The hubs chose jalapeños, green chiles, pinto beans, ketchup, and mustard in a spicy beer brat. YUH-MEE! I hope I see this truck again...I'm gettin' my own next time!!

First off, I wanna say thank you to Lindsey for putting together such a fun event! We sadly had to cancel last minute for the last one because we had family obligations, but I'm SO glad we got to make this one!  Short Leash Dogs was in the house serving up yummy deliciousness. They have a standard menu or you can make your own. There are so many choices! Different types of "dogs", a plethora of toppings...holy Moses!  Film Bar has a number of beers on tap and a few wines as well. I was looking for a white since it was so hot out but alas I could not find one sweet enough for my palate. BUT I did find a Pinot Noir that was light and fruity = happiness!  I loved the mystery of not finding out what movie is playing until it starts. I guess Lindsey did it different this time and had a "quiz" with hints to see who could figure out what movie it would be. So much fun! The movie this month was Raising Arizona. I had never seen it before nor even knew what it was about but it turned out to be really funny! 80's funny, but still funny :-P   I can't wait to come to the next event! (Hopefully )
