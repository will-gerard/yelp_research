I have used Discount Tire in the past, but was blown away by the service I received at this location recently. I made a same-day appointment online for new tires and wheels for a used car I recently purchased. When I arrived at the store, Nick quickly evaluated my car and then worked with me to determine the best package to suit my needs. I expected to have to wait for a few hours while the work was done. Instead, I was out the door within an hour! I feel much safer and look forward to returning to the store for the included services on tires in the future. Highly recommend!

I often come here for lunch specials ($6.55 for the combo plate) and am always surprised by the lack of customers. In speaking with the owner, many of the surrounding stores have closed due to rent being raised so I think they are easily overlooked. I like that the combo portions are sized perfectly for one person and come with a soup selection, entr√©e choice, one crab Rangoon, and one spring roll. Normally I order a beef entree, but the last visit I ordered the cashew chicken combo which was tasty and fresh. The service is great and the owners are personable.

I found a free basic bike maintenance class on meetup.com that Global Bikes was offering on March 19. Dustin, the service manager at the Gilbert location, led the class. He did an excellent job showing us what tools we need and how to use them. In the class, I learned how to change a tire, check the inner tube for holes, and clean and lube my chain. Without this class, I would have never realized what I can do to maintain my bike and get the best performance out of it. Dustin answered all of our questions with confidence. I will definitely be back to Global Bikes!

I've been a AAA member for less than a month and already regret joining. I should have looked at the reviews here before banking on the AAA reputation. I bought a used car from a private seller last Friday (7/8) and took it to this AAA Auto Repair shop for inspection and repairs. I spoke with Jeff and asked for an estimate on all needed repairs so I could decide if I could do everything within my budget or would need to wait on some items. I was told the inspection should be done that afternoon or Saturday. By Saturday around 11:30 am, I had yet to hear back. I called and had to leave a message. A few hours later, I still had not had my call returned and they were closing soon. I called again and spoke with Debbie, who told me Jeff was off until Monday. She tried to help me, but the inspection had still not been completed. I then contacted AAA member services to express my disappointment and frustration as there was no contact information for the office manager listed. On Monday morning, I was told management would contact me as soon as possible. It's been over 24 hours and I still have not heard from a manager. I did hear from both Jeff and Debbie yesterday, but each time I talk to someone, the costs and repairs continue to increase. I am also still without a car. Jeff offered to get a rental car yesterday afternoon, but as I was told my car should be ready today, I declined. Today is now half over and I still have yet to hear from ANYONE in the office for an update.  At this point, I will end up over my budget and regret both joining AAA and taking my car there.

The food here was great, but the cleanliness of the restaurant left a lot to be desired. It sounded like they were short staffed the day I went in, but cleanliness in a restaurant should be top priority. I ordered boneless wings and fries with the ATL seasoning. Highly recommend!
