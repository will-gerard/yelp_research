As you can imagine every time there is something wrong with your car it can be very stressful. I have a German car so I was worried that my car wouldn't run the same and that it would coast me a fortune in repairs. These guys were able to diagnose the issue right away and fix it that same day at a reasonable price. I was so thankful to have my car running like new! I would definitely recommend them to anyone! I will be going back for any car issues I have in the future because I count on these guys to fix my car!!! Thank you desert motive!!

This is the only place I will go now to get my gels and pedicure. The price for a full set of gels are priced fairly and their pedicures are a great price as well. I have never left this place unhappy, people do tend to have high expectations and want some crazy design off Pinterest but lets be realistic. I find the best thing to do is just tell them you want a design that looks good this will insure you that they are going to do the best design that they are good at. This place is clean and in a convenient location if you live on this side of town.

This old management in the front office did not do their job efficiently. They left important parts of my lease out on the copy they gave me (that I had to give a 60 day notice before my lease is up)  ended up really screwing me over and when I confronted them their response was "well you did sign the agreement online" yeah I understand that but too bad I'm unable to access the correct lease online and the copy you gave me didn't have the correct information.   Another problem I had was a minor flood from the rain that stained the laminate flooring because I had a rug on it. Well when it came time to move out I ended up having to pay for the damages to the laminate floor. Their response is "well you shouldn't have anything of the carpet or floor" not exaggerating at all that's what they told me. Apparently the correct way to live is not have any furniture.   The apartment complex is swarmed with unattended children that cause damages to vehicles and are very obnoxious in the pool area and gym ( where they shouldn't be left unattended). I know this is more towards the parents but the management could confronted the parents or start kicking the children out pool area when they are getting out of hand.   When I would go turn in my month rent to the front I would see Stacy (red hair lady) office manager roll her eyes at residents and talk badly about them the second they left it was really uncomfortable seeing that and unprofessional.   The apartment was nice and big I really enjoyed what I was paying for my experience would have been much nicer if it was for the front management team being so rude and unhelpful. I saw when I left they replaced the office staff which may be a better fit for residents. Good luck and hope they are better than the last.

I have been going to this place since they open I later moved to Scottsdale and still make the drive to come eat here because every other Greek place I've tried doesn't compare to this place . The food is always wonderful and the lady running the place is so kind.

Wasn't impressed at all in this place I went on a Friday around 4 somewhat close to their closing time. They were somewhat busy but not slammed, the whole time I felt very rushed. The ladies were rushing us so bad that they cut the back of my boyfriends foot from scrubbing too hard and fast. I don't have high Pinterest expectations on my nail design so I said whatever you're good at I'm fine with. The design came out looking horrible the simple flower looked like I did it and there is a reason why I don't do my nails. I ended up having to go somewhere else the next day. Also it wasn't very clean and I had these little gnats flying all over me. I don't like to leave bad reviews but this is the worst place I have been to.

I work a lot with this location and they are great. The second I call them to pick up a customer they show up within 10 min and always escort the customer to the car and even help them with their luggage or bags. Their customer service is great and I have never had a issue with them. Highly recommend this place.
