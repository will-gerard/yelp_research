If I could give zero stars I would. Terrible customer service on a washing machine delivery with absolutely no concern for the time of delivery promised. This will be our last purchase at Best Buy because it has far and away been anything but the Worst experience.. Best advice for 'Best' Buy? Just DON'T do it.

Seriously fantastic- I had an emergency -leaking toliet and what a crazy mes was occurring.. Steve called me back- here within an hour! Due to the rapid nature of the problem I figured I better use a large company thinking they would be able to get out fast so I had called George Brazil first and they were so rude and condescending I decided to give a smaller company a try. So very glad I did. What a great experience...Steve was so professional and nice. THIS is how great service is done.

Found myself in horrible discomfort this weekend with a root canal gone bad...the dentist who had previously treated me did not complete the job properly and I got a terrible infection. On the recommendation of my new and truly wonderful dentist Dr. Joh, I was referred to Dr. Krygier's office. They were nothing short of amazing from the first impression...even offering to stay late to see me as a brand new patient?!! Huge thumbs up! I was really worried about a good result after the train wreck one I had experienced. Dr. Krygier was on time and was extremely honest with his treatment recommendation. His team was so welcoming and immediately made me feel at ease which meant a lot to me! Although I hope NOT to see them again anytime soon (no offense)....if a root canal could possibly be pleasant this is as good as it gets!

Hands down the BESt pancakes in the valley! Monkey pancakes and yes the jalapeno pecan pancakes are both outstanding. Can't remember the name of the coffee I tried but it had an orange, chocolatey  essence and it was amazing. Worth looking for!!!

We used to love Grazie. We used to frequent both locations when they had North Scottsdale too. Our last 3 visits -YES we gave em 3 shots after a truly unacceptable experience- the service has been atrocious and the food average at best. No one in the place and dirty tables, no one to greet you and when you are finally acknowledged, a grunt to take a table. Waited again over 15 minutes for anyone to even give us menus. I don't know where their lovely daughter Sam has gone but she needs to return and rescue this sinking ship fast.

Super disappointed with the customer service here. Have had great massages with Dan who is an excellent provider. Scheduling appointments however, is anything but simple. Long waits in person (only have one person on reception during busier hours) AND on phone to get any services scheduled then disconnected several times. After being told they scheduled one of two services for us for our anniversary weekend with the promise of a return call to see if a provder could extend their schedule for the other appointment, we received no call back nor help. Received NO return call and after being disconnected yet again on the thrid attempt to reach a care provider, found out that not only was the first service NOT held as promised but that they had no record of any call whatsoever. Management was of little help..Eric offered no apology and did not seem to care at all if his team delivered substandard care. Clearly, the lack of experience in spa management has trickled down accordingly.   Truly a shame because the facilities are so pretty. They could bat a home run but fail to even get on base.  With so many great resort spas to select from in Scottsdale, the Sanctuary will get my money this weekend as they NEVER fail to deliver excellent customer service as well as provider service.

As a small business owner I appreciate super customer service. This is as good as it gets! O and Jayce did such a beautiful job cleaning our carpets at Karve Studio North Scottsdale. We have found our new carpet cleaners!! Prompt, courteous, reasonable and a BEAUTIFUL job!! Can I give a 5Plus?!?

This was a fantastic experience from the minute we walked in. Best meal I have had in the Valley and served in a beautiful patio setting. I had the beet salad- beautifully presented with yellow and purple beets. For the main course we both had the Halibut which was substituted for the Chilean sea bass but prepared the same way. It was bar none the best piece of fish I have had in AZ and  beautifully prepared. Desserts are available in petite portions so you can sample several. Get the Chocolate Nachitos for SURE! We loved it so much we went back for dinner the next night and I had lunch there the day after that. Every visit was great. service excellent too..especially Lynn. My new favorite!

Zero stars. Is that even possible? Absolutely awful customer service. A friend bought me a membership and I already had a gym membership so declined to use it. Never signed a single contract nor set foot in the gym. Have been repeatedly harassed for payment when I DID NOT AUTHORIZE nor want this! I asked them to produce a contract w my signature which they could not. They have now sent me to collections. Next call is to the Better Business Bureau. The collection company was as awful as the gym management. Stated 'you are lying' and would not even listen to an explanation. RUN do not patronize this unethical business. The only liars are the management at Golds Gym. How can this even be permitted?

The entire team at AMI was so welcoming and knowledgeable. My engagement ring is absolutely gorgeous & we have gotten a ton of compliments on it. They really took their time with us resulting in a perfectly sized beautifully styled custom breathtaking unique setting. Indra really knows his stuff. You will be shocked at what amazing value you will receive here.

Lisa was so wonderful with my cat Lucy. I found them through yelp and am so glad I did. I think Lucy was a bit disappointed to se me walk up the stairs after vacation they were so wonderful with her lol! You will feel so comfortable trusting your fur kids to them.

I am beyond the pale to put it mildly and I was thrilled with the super service, streak-free tan and perfectly believable color that Chris gave me! Got so many people asking me if I had gone on vacation I decided to actual take one!! I have gone back every other week since. The color lasts me about 8 days...longer than any other spray tanI had before. I also really like a more recent formula she used on me that you wash off after only 3 hours.  NICE!!! I did buy the Hemp lotion which smelled great and I think may be helping me hold the color so long. Highly recommend and have told every bride I know about this place!!! Clean, reasonably priced and they have really cute dresses there too...

This is a busy parents REAL life dream! Super cute place with wonderful staff- Tina, Angela, Jasmin and Deanna are caring and thoughtful providers. Clean, lots of fun for the kiddos, plenty of activities. Great location if you live in the DC ranch, Grayhawk and MCDowell Mountain neighborhood.

It was incredibly hot yesterday and my air went out. Found these fellows on yelp and wanted to give them a try. Today the two Johnny's came and to fix my air conditioning. They tried to save me money by going with the lesser option and offerred to apply the original payment in case I ended up needing a new fan motor. Worked great for a few hours before it went out again. The guys came back out immediately after I called and installed the fan applying the first call totals to the new fan motor. Excellent service and two super nice guys. Fairly priced as well. I am so freaking happy my house that felt like a sauna is starting to come back to life.

Great service, amazing pizza and save room for the Chocolate Calzone! So happy to have great pizza in North Scottsdale! This former east cast gal has found her new Pizza Joint with a nice ambiance to boot. So glad this close to home spot re-opened with better pizza, better service and super happy hour!

BEST Macarons ever tasted. Seriously.  The black currant, Strawberry champagne and white chocolate grand marnier were simply insane. Abby is so welcoming and clearly takes great pride in the amazing offerrings. Super friendly staff who will make you feel right at home.

We hired Deb and crew to assist with a corporate event for our business. They were timely, professional, fun and everyone loved it! My employees are still raving about the party largely in part to Debbie and her team. Highly reccommend.

I am so truly fortunate to live within walking distance of this hidden gem! Delicious, organic juices, healthy salads and gluten free baked goods that are so fantastic. Green Dragon is my ultimate fav juice- spicy!!, Keri Green when I want a little bit on the sweeter side and the Flu Shot is a staple every time I feel a little something coming on. Warning: Garlic and oregano will ensure NO VAMPIRES, nor sickness (or anyone else for that matter )coming close anytime soon:)! Seriously stops the funk dead in its tracks before becoming a full fledged cold!  Miraculous!   The kale and quinoa salad is nothing short of fantastic. Protein cinnamon raisin cookies and morning Glory Muffins will knock your socks off!  Great energy here- you are always greeted personally with a smile from lovely Jodi and the nice gal on Mondays who's name is eluding me. Simply awesome!! Can I double my stars??? 10++++

I really really want to enjoy going here more often because the acai bowls are absolutely amazing. Have been to this location multiple times and each tlme I have experienced really, really poor service. 6 people working- 5 texting on cell phone(s?!?!?)- lines to the door. To complicate- there is no phone number listed anywhere to pre order in hope of avoiding the traffic jam sure to ensue. The PB greenie bowl is so good I have sucked it up but most of us are in a hurry and can't devote an hour to 'quick and healthy'. If there were maybe even free wifi available at least you could get work done while you waited. No wifi, the staff did not even know if they had wifi...  said the company as a whole has no phone numbers listed for pre ordering...its just hard to watch such potential for greatness lose stars due to awful customer service. No hustle witnessed EVER... almost like they are shuffling behind the counter in slow-motion. It has the makings of a funny Saturday Night Live skit.  Today I was tempted to start filming it was that bad. Running out of strawberries with 6 people working, 5 on cell phones and none having the foresight to perhaps run to the Whole Foods up the street.... Grabba Green and the simply amazing Kaleidoscope are gonna be grabbing my GREEN moving forward as service like this is just not not going to cut it!

Really enjoyed my first class today at RPM spin. Beautiful, clean and welcoming studio  with excellent instruction close to home- sweet! Superior sound system and lighting made the ride so much fun. The 'drop saddle style' was really interesting... I like that it doesn't appear to build any bulk. Loved the 'dance party on a bike' atmosphere and can't wait to return!

Dee is the ultimate professional! She really took her time with me and thoroughly explained the procedure prior to treatment. I feel it's very important to get an experienced professional for best results. Eager to see how this goes!

My absolute favorite. Close to home too! Such a friendly greeting every time you walk in. Rossco & Karlee are so gracious and the food is to die for! We love the spicy snag pizza so much that it took a few weeks of visits to convince is to try something else. Well, we may have been a little strong armed in the most delightful way to try something new. We gave El Diablo a go this evening at Rossco's convincing and have fallen in love with Base all over again. We even got to celebrate Australia Day with this lively team. Base has become our go to place. Highly recommend!!
