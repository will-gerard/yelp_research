Really disappointed with PreFlight right now.  Due to construction, you cannot reserve a space, even 6-7 weeks out, you call to see if a space is available and they are not sure.  You cannot prepay, losing valuable savings, and the coupon right now is not very good unless you stay a Saturday night.  I will most likely have to look to another lot the night 3 trips, and PreFlight is now in danger of losing a repeat customer to a competitor.

Always a great visit to see Dr. Rouhani.  Always looks out for the best interest of his patients, and that's why his practice is growing.  If you are looking for a new dentist, definitely consider Smile Concepts.

South course is as bad as it gets for golf in AZ. Used to be nice here. Not sure what happened. Worst conditions I have ever seen in April on a golf course.

My wife and I absolutely love these guys.  Dr Resnik has been our guy since day one and for a 3-year old to be happy to go to the Dr says a lot for him.  Maybe it is because they share a birthday, but I expect it to be for the level of care he provides, and to follow up at 8:00 pm with a call speaks volumes for Dr. Resnik.  We have another on the way and it is not even a question as to who the Dr will be.

Nothing better in AZ.  This is where I would go for my last meal.

Best locksmith I have ever dealt with. Not just there to install locks, but also to make sure your home is as safe possible. Will not hesitate to use again.

23 minutes to get through the vacuum alone.  Maybe the guys working here should work and stop trying to up sell everyone. Hopefully with new ownership this place will change but I doubt it. Anyone want to buy some prepaid washes as I will not be coming back. A horrible experience once again from a Danny's location.

Service was average. Food was over priced. First time in years of using open table that a birthday request was not even acknowledged at check in. Not for a special occasion. Bar and happy hour look cool though.

Used them for a July move after several other moves with a different company.  They have great follow up, show up on time, and handled the move with care and professionalism.  The only issue is cost, as they were about $400-$500 more than expected, and I know it is hot in July, but I think it definitely took a couple hours longer then expected.  Would use again, but prefer the old days of knowing the price before the move starts.

Spent about 3 weeks interviewing window company's from town. Had a good feeling after meeting with the owner, Darin and was able to get the pricing right for the 11 windows we replaced.   Install was great and Chris and his crew were professional and did a great job. The windows look great and hopefully they will make a difference with heating and cooling costs, as that would be a bonus. Will use them again when we change out more windows in the future.

Quality innovative products, timely service and response times, fair prices, and advice that does not feel like product pushing.  Very happy with our system and the service and advice we have received so far.  Looking forward to adding on to it in the near future.

Quality work.  Fair prices.  They show up on time and follow up to make sure all went well.  We had 4 kitchen chairs that were about to be sent out to be replaced, and Rob wanted to give them a try before we replaced them, and somehow he got them to look new again.  The carpets look great as well and we will definitely be using them again.

Quality work and reasonable prices. Definitely the place to go for a broken iPhone or iPad screen.

This event needs a total makeover if they are ever going to do it again.  Horrible parking, badly organized, and not what was expected from a Halloween event. Where were the games?  5-6 things for kids under 5 to do.   Basically this was an event to see tethered balloons with some food.  Not even worth the 1/2 price tickets. I feel bad for anyone who paid full price.
