Let's get the ugly part out of the way first: The staff simply creeped me out with their questionable ways (includes demeanor, attire, and attitude).  Besides that, I loved it. I ate here three times, drunk all three times. It was a business trip; give me a break. The food is authentic and reasonably priced. Worth mentioning is the side dish of choice, garlic mashed potatoes. They even have some relatively obscure beers, which makes me happy. It was clearly worth my repeated patronage.

I can't be any clearer about this: This was the absolute worst pizza I have ever eaten in my life.  I understand the average review before my writing is 4.5 stars, but I simply cannot conceive of this idea. Somehow, after the first rancid slice, I was able to continue through almost two more slices before my disgust overwhelmed my hunger. I don't care if I'm used to great pizza in Chicago, there has GOT to be something in between...

I feel the Days Inn Tempe is best described as "a place where you can purchase the right to sleep for awhile."   I booked my 10-night stay on Travelocity for a non-smoking room, yet when I entered the room I almost choked. It was disgusting. I've never had a smoking hotel room before and I will make sure I don't again. They said they couldn't move us to a different room.  My local lady friend brought over a bottle of wine but forgot a corkscrew. No big deal, I thought to myself, as the front desk of a hotel will surely have a corkscrew. Nope. Coors Light it is.  The towels felt like they were made of cow tongue, and they missed our wakeup call one morning making me late for a training class that had cost me about $500.  I'm awarding one star in addition to the minimum one-star rating because I got to drink cheap beer by the pool in 90 degree weather for 10 days, and there are a few good places to eat and two dollar stores very nearby. The dollar store had a corkscrew.

I won't hear anyone attempting to take anything away from the quality of a Jersey Mike's sub. They make a tasty sandwich with seriously good ingredients. Were I reviewing based on taste alone, we would be talking about five stars.  But you can't get out of there with a reasonable meal for anything less than ten bucks. Mike should be grateful that my price-sensitive ass is only removing one star for that.

I don't know how many beers Yard House has on tap, but it's a shit-ton. More than I've seen at any other bar. And the servers have as complete a knowledge of them as you could ask for.  Although the actual food and presentation are terrific, I find the menu a little overpriced since many of the dishes come in smaller portions.  Hot Tip: Have your business partner's friend from Florida call during your meal to admit he has elephantitis from falling down in the street. This made for great entertainment for us and the surrounding tables (hello, speakerphone), so I imagine it would for you too.
