I have gotten my nails done here a few times. Medocre work. Last time I went there they quoted me ten dollars less then what I paid. I asked for for an extra gel coat for white color and the nail girl charged me for both a full acrylic amd a gel manicure after quoting me a different price. I just paid the bill and vowed to never be back.  I had received a reference for another nail salon and when the nails started to come off prematurely I made an apmnt.  The technician advised that I requested they use the type of nails that were actuallybused. It turns out they used the wrong size bc they were to lazy to adjust the nails correctly.    Extremely disappointed. I WILL NEVER be back

Clothes were okay. I hate clothing stores like forever 21 who have poor quality clothes thrown everywhere. Pitaya was at least organized. If it weren't for the employees i may go back. They were very unhelpful, rude, and there look didn't help the store. Too bad because i went two stores down to Diva's. Somewhat similar cloth (id prefer diva's) and the sales girls were great. Probably should have noticed the amount of people in Pitaya (0) vs the other stored in the area.

absolutely LOVE this place. after gong into Pitaya i almost canceled shopping on mill (poor quality clothes, rude poorly dressed associates). Diva's has really cute clothes at a great price. It usually shop at Bebe or Nordstroms but this store is definitely on my list

Went there for a few different things.  They missed the oil change but told me i could come in after they had already closed. Completed everything at no additional charge. Thank you!!
