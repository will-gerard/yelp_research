I have thought about writing this review and then stopped myself time and again.  I walked into this salon with long, healthy, shiny, well-maintained hair.  The only similarity when I walked out was that it was long. I have been there once before and was so-so happy with the result, with it was easy, convenient and one can get an appointment almost immediately.  I needed that.  Lesson learned.    When I went back  the second time I told Kelley that I did not like the all over color and that my hair was very orange at the roots.  Every single thing I told Kelley, he nodded, agreed, and did the opposite!  I have (had) highlighted hair and specifically told him countless times that I did not want all over color, and highlights.  Guess what I got?  Exactly what I asked not to have; and it is orange blonde.  My hair is completely over processed, it is dry, coarse and unmanageable at the moment.  I have since been to another salon to try to get this mess fixed up and was told that it would take between 8 and 12 months to get my hair back in good condition.  I always have roots from highlights, now I have a true long pathway from front to back.  With highlighting, it will slowly start to fill in the pathway but it will take several months before I actually look like I don't have dark roots all the time.  I will not do all over color again so little by little with highlighting that area will begin to fill in with the blonde but it will take MONTHS.  I was referred to the salon by a friend; I saw her and asked her about her experience there and she told me the same thing; HE DOESN'T LISTEN TO WHAT YOU WANT!  She still goes there as she is constantly changing her hair and for her the price is right.  She also has short hair so if it is a mess, it will take a short time to grow out.  My hair is down my back so a disaster for me is long term!  It may work for some but it does not work for me.    As I just spent one hour this morning trying to do my hair (usually takes less than 30 minutes and is perfect)  - and it still looks like #@)t, I just got irritated enough to write this review.

I am en event planner in Scottsdale and use Jared Blake Entertainment at most of my events.  With Jared and his "crew", you are assured an incredible party.  The DJ can make or break your event  - I know that when I hire JBE, my clients are getting the best - and the feedback I get back after each event voices that opinion!

One of the worst meals ever.  Service was bad, food was bad.  Never going back.

I'm an event planner and was looking for entertainment for an event I was working on.  Hired Brett and he was absolutely amazing!  The crowd was completely in awe of him - he even did his magic on me and he was spot on with what I was thinking about!  He was supposed to do a bit of strolling and a show but he was so unbelievable going up to crowds and entertaining them (or rather mesmerizing them) that we chose to forgo the parlor show and just had him do his thing.   Guests just loved him (the hostess of the party has been getting calls all day) and I am sure that I will be booking him constantly.  Thanks Brett!

Leah did my daughter's hair and makeup for her prom.  She did an amazing job!  My daughter looked absolutely beautiful and was so happy with it all - and if you know teen girls, that is a big feat!  I am an event planner and do many events - Leah will be my go to makeup and hair specialist for my clients from now on!   Oh, and she does house calls!
