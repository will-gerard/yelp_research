I agree with some of the reviews, this place has the potential to be a go-to Downtown Phoenix restaurant, but falls short on so many levels. The only part of my meal that I can say was good was the chips and salsa - that is the only thing they have down. The staff was okay.  But there are so many other restaurants near here that it is going to hard to come back.  They have a great outdoor patio and location so they have the ability to thrive. My coworkers and I all felt the same way, our main entrees were awful.  All I had was a salad and soup, and I'm not sure how that can be messed up but it was.  There was not enough flavor and overall zest.  Canyon was kind supplying us with white peppermint chocolate tamales for dessert, which were quite tasty. But that is not going to be enough to win back the meal.

Decor is amazing in this hidden joint! My review is based only on 3 tacos and the nachos... Chicken taco, fish taco and barbacoa taco. All were very good and the nachos with green chile avocado salsa is absolutely delicious!!! Our waiter had to keep refilling our bowl - it was that good.   I will be back to try the seafood at this little gem especially the volcano (I think that was the name) which was sizzling next to us. It entailed fish, shrimp and steak - mmmmmm!

Only reason I come here is because I get $5 off the total before 9am on Sunday. This recent experience, they forgot to clean the dashboard (dust, dust and more dust) and I almost drove off with the marker of my wash on my windshield?! Those are the two most important parts to clean after a car wash!!!!  If I didn't need to come here, I wouldn't. Plain and simple.

Boy, did I enjoy those fried pickles and chicken wings. These really did hit the spot when I decided to spurge for my birthday this year!   I know now where I want to come when I want some wings or pickles, or any other tasty bar food. I would be safe to say that the wings I had at Armadillo Grill were some of the best in Phoenix (and I've had a lot of wings throughout the valley). But make sure to order the wings with Armadillo Gold Sauce, they were made to perfection.    Be sure to to have a nice beer and enjoy some games on one of the many screens.  There is also a patio for the warmer weather :)

Don't come to Jamba often but when I do, I always have a good/quick experience with a delicious smoothie.

What's not to love at Trader's! 5 Stars all around! It is always friendly and clean at this location.  Trader's has a great selection in produce, meat, dairy, nuts and don't forget about the snacks. Everything is priced just right and no other store can ever beat that.  My weekly spot to food shop :)

A delightful and tasteful restaurant Hillstone is. Not only is the food a real treat, but the atmosphere and architecture is beautiful. A large and creative patio always adds a different vibe to your dining experience.   This evening I tried their sushi as an additional appetizer and the Spicy Tuna Roll hit the spot. The chefs create and jazz up your typical sushi roll, I would highly recommend.  The staples I personally order are the artichoke appetizer and Ahi Tuna Burger.  The artichoke is a delectable, Hillstone prepares and cooks this dish to perfection. You are able to order a full artichoke or half if you are feeling a little stuffed. Be prepared, the Ahi Tuna is a large sandwich and filling. The ahi is cooked medium rare and placed on a bun with a delicious sauce. I have yet to try any steak/salad but this is definitely next on my list.   In addition to my list, I would love a nice ice cream sundae with a warm cookie for brownie! I highly recommend Hillstone if you are in this area, you will not regret your experience. The staff are very helpful and friendly to meet your needs on any given night.

Service was quick - but all I had ordered was a sesame bagel with cream cheese. So I should be quick.  All I will say is that they barely put any cream cheese on the bagel!! I had to pull the bagel apart just to see they remembered to put it on!

Phoenix sky airport is usually an easy departure city and airport for me but it depends what terminal I am leaving out of. I love how the airport has introduced all of the local restaurants into the terminals. All of the employees are pretty friendly and it is an easily accessible airport. The addition of the new PHX Sky Train has been amazing! I will be using this all the time now!

This place is not attractive from the outside so I was hesitant to go in. It was very clean inside and noticed it as a family run business. Food is okay, my gyro was served cold to even with a lunch order for 6 people. Service is friendly when not busy.

Nice course to play with decent greens and a lot of pine trees are on the course.  Twice I said to myself, it does not feel like I am in Arizona!   Friendly staff with a tasty cafe that has the option of indoor or outdoor seating.  I would most certainly return, preferably in the cooler months. Price is right about there for the play.  GPS units on carts died after about hole 11.

Always come here for lunch except in the summer when they are closed. I mean, at over 100 degrees F, it gets hot on a farm! You can always find fresh food at the Farm Kitchen and its a great atmosphere for lunch. Does not feel like you are in Phoenix! There is a cute sitting area outside the kitchen and a bunch of picnic tables throughout the grounds. Tons of greenery and beautiful landscape you don't normally see in the Phoenix area. It is great to come over here on a weekend with a blanket and have a picnic out on the grass. If you need to relax and rewind, I highly recommended checking this place out - you won't regret it!  Sandwiches are great (Chicken BLTDA) and so are salads, they are pre-made and sit on ice at the Kitchen. Morning Glory has great reviews for breakfast/lunch and I have yet to make it over there. And as of now, I still have Quiessence bookmarked on my list ready to try!

Add another location to my favorite Roy's Restaurant. This Roy's is located in a beautiful resort up in North Scottsdale, JW Marriott Resort and Spa. Hawaiian cuisine that you can never go wrong with.  They usually have a price fix menu on Monday's, which is always worth it!

Food was good, but do not come on a Saturday at 1pm and sit on the outdoor patio. Only sit if you have a bunch of hours to kill. Came here and it took forever for a server to even give us menu's. I typically like Kona Grill and enjoy the food, but woah this service!   Happy hour is always a great deal but have to downgrade on this review particularly for the serving issue.

I have came to a realization why they decided to call this place Zinc Bistro, or at least I think. But boy oh boy, this restaurant is delicious. Dined for lunch with the Varzi salumi salad and butter leaf champagne with a glass of a refreshing red sangria. Salad was extremely tasty and the sangria was light and perfect for a sunny day. I contemplated giving 4 stars since our server was not the friendliest nor did the hostess allow us to sit where we wanted. But the food was so delectable, I have decided to wave that off (which never happens)! Great atmosphere and outdoor patio in the Kierland area.  Every time new dishes were brought out to the tables, my mouth watered, yum. I can't wait to try Zinc for dinner one night, it will be worth it! Enjoy!

Venezia's is one of only a handful of places in Phoenix that I would go to for pizza. I always enjoy coming here for pizza at lunch, there is one very close to my office on Mill. This is a casual pizzeria, perfect for a quick bite. They have a decent variety of slices and a great meal combo at lunch. They have a decent regular slice and this is how I always judge the pizza place!

Whenever I am on the west side, want Mexican and want to splurge, this is the place to go! Food is definitely the best around. I've been searching for a place like this since I moved to Phoenix.  Some people may dislike the decor and blah blah, I think it gives it a distinguished feel.   Our waitress that served our group of six was on top of her game and all her other tables. She re-filled the chips and salsa a whopping three times. I kept eating them, chip after chip, saying to myself, "these chips are so light and the salsa is so fresh"!  Lunch menu gives healthy portions at a great price. I had the chicken fajitas and had enough food to last a week. I am definitely going to come back to enjoy more of the variety off the menu. Of course I over ate :)  La Piñata. One word, Yum.

One of my favorite spring training stadiums in Scottsdale to attend a game. I love this location since it is so close to Old Town and walkable distance to any restaurants or bars. The stadium and lawn seats are great, since most of them are in the shade for part of the game. It does get hot so make sure to drink tons of water. Great atmosphere!!!

Holy Avocado Egg Roll! As soon I took a bite of this, the flavors were bursting and it felt like I was in Hawaii for a second! If I could eat these everyday, I would but that is not going to happen.  Kona not only has fresh sushi rolls, nice variety there, but they offer American cuisine as well.   Happy hour is pretty bomb at this place.  Like most reviews, menu is higher priced so if you're not going during HH just be prepared.  Menu has a good variety.  Fish tanks add a nice feel but would appreciate a little more vibe to escape from "everyday dining".

My friend recommended Malee's one day for lunch for some Thai food and we have been back 3 times since!  The food is great here and very authentic.  Right in the heart of Old Town, it is 100% fresh cuisine from Thailand.  The restaurant has a great atmosphere.  I never have had Tom Ka Gai soup before but this place makes it phenomenal, its their famous hot and sour soup just bursting of flavors!  I would highly recommend if you like this type of soup.  I also ordered a medium spiced chicken dish with lettuce wraps.  These were tasty but will definitely try some other dishes the next time I go back, which will be soon.

This is the place to go if your looking for a good Mexican restaurant in Old Town.  Frank & Lupe's has decent prices (not your typical Scottsdale prices) with very authentic Mexican food. There is also never a true crowd or wait but is always has a constant flow of people but be prepared on a Friday or Saturday night.    The chicken enchiladas with poblano sauce was recommended to me once and I have never looked back, they are always on my order.  My last trip here I tried to beef tacos are are scrumptious, the taco shells are homemade -  yummm! This just brings me to the chips, which are also homemade and usually come to the table either warm or hot.  Salsa is different and adds a little kick.  Always have wanted to try a house margarita, everyone seems to order them so maybe give it a shot!

Decided to check out the Persian Room and I am glad I did. The complimentary bread is served with butter, herbs (basil and cilantro) and a onion. This is an unbelievable combination that I didn't anticipate to work well together, but it did!   For a starter, I tried the eggplant hummus which was tasty but could have done without. The main course of the Chicken Shish adding a side of the Greek salad. The flavors of the chicken were top notch and I highly recommend. Finished off the night with a Turkish coffee.  All in all, I had a great experience at the Persian Room and will return real soon!

I've been to Harlow's a couple of times now for morning meetings at breakfast.  Let's just say I would not come here if I didn't have to be.  It is a hole in the wall kind of place.  My boss has come here since he was a child so he sentimental to it.  Not my kind of place, but I do know that the huevos rancheros are good.

Every time I come to House of tricks, I am always satisfied with amazing food. I often come during lunch time and it is better to come here during the cooler months since the outside patio is a pretty place to sit with sometimes an ongoing fire.  Brought my brother here when he was in town, who is a chef, and he was very pleased with his food. He actually got some ideas from his meal.  This is definitely one of our favorites with a friendly staff. Whatever I have tried at House of Tricks is always delicious. Today I had the Salmon with risotto over a salad enhanced with mango - WOW. Also, I would recommend any of their specials, they are always well prepared and taste is always on key. Props to the chef, will come here time and time again. :)

Great place for an event! I have only been to the hockey games at Jobing.com Arena but there is not a single bad seat there.  I would like to check out a concert here at some point in time.  I just wish this place was not all the way out in Glendale!!

Awesome stadium that can be converted from an outdoor stadium to an indoor one with AC (only in Arizona!).  Diverse choices of food for the games that are decent. Can never leave a game without getting a traditional hot dog.  Always check it out when the mets are in town to play :)

Rooms are clean, updated and a decent size for the price. MGM was a nice place to stay but it seemed as though everywhere we wanted to go we needed a taxi and not a walkable distance especially in the rain.   This was my first time in Vegas and I thought everything would be more gaudy and fabulous. Like I said, MGM is nice but next time I would like to be right in the middle of the strip.  My one complaint is Sunday morning around 7:00AM, the hotel service knocked on our door to make sure we would be out before checkout. We were all well aware of what time checkout was and waking you up at that time on a Sunday in Vegas is a killer! Highly disappointed.

Food and service are both great here with an array selection of draft beers. Small outdoor patio with a couple of tables. My friends were more into this place than me but the turkey burger I ordered was perfectly seasoned and tasty. I can't complain about the sweet potatoes fries either, dippin' in some aioli sauce - YUM!  The atmosphere is different here, with blue  lighted accents throughout. Futuristic feel vibe. Apparently they serve sushi as well. Burger/sushi combo is something I never pictured. Nice joint in the neighborhood!

Love the restaurants in Kierland, they all have their own unique vibe with delectable food. The style and layout of Greenhouse is not what you would normally see in Scottsdale and reminds me of an northeast restaurant on the coast. But this is another great Fox concept!   I came here for lunch and tried the chopped kale salad (without corn) and added some protein with chicken. It was delicious and tasted so healthy. My friend had the greenhouse salad, which she gets every time and another good choice. Service is good and portions are on the smaller side compared to the price.  Would love to try this place for dinner one night after reading all the entree reviews. Maybe Sunday night with a 1/2 bottle of wine!

Man, I love this hike more and more every time I do it. It's a bit of a challenge and be prepared for some rock climbing closer to the tippy top on Cholla Trail. Echo is steeper but the view at the top is always worth it! So make sure to have you're camera with you. You don't want to hike all of that without getting a picture to represent your hard work!!!  If you're going to attempt to go on a weekend, make sure to wake up early. Finding parking and the walk to the trail head will take extra time. But be prepared, it will still be busy.  Happy hiking and wear good shoes!

Pizza is not to shabby here. I like it better than Bianco and in some ways is comparable to a New York slice. But definitely a good decision to check out CIBO if you're in the mood for a good pizza in Phoenix! One key to good pizza is the dough and the crust is soft!  Great atmosphere, ambiance, quaint any time of the year. Love the outdoor seating on the patio with fire areas, live music and an assortment of lights. Service was okay, I had an empty water the whole meal.   I would definitely come back here and try some other pizzas and maybe an entree. For dessert, we had the strawberry banana crepe with Nutella - I mean a crepe with chcoclate, yum. But they were out of their other chocolate dessert :( Let me rewind back to appetizer, caprese salad is enough for a handful of people. The mozzarella tossed with pesto, oregano, EVOO, chopped fresh basil and grape tomatoes is absolutely scrumptious.   Check it out !

Decided to try Asi Es La Vida and boy am I glad that I did.  Enjoyed the Carne Tampiquena which is amazing - thinly sliced top sirloin served with a poblano pepper filled with cheese, enmolada, guacamole and beans. The food came out hot and ready to eat!  This is a nice little place on 24th street with great decor and friendly service.  I cannot wait to return and try more items out on the menu along with maybe a friendly margarita.

This is a great place to come to for a Saturday or Sunday brunch but be prepared to wait. I came around noon on a Sunday with not many people waiting in front of me, the hostess said 15 minutes and we did not end up getting seated for 45 minutes. That was definitely not cool. Service is okay.  The first time I was here, I ordered the hot cakes which were not my favorite. Second time around I went with the short rib hash and it is to DIE FOR. If you can't decide what to choose on the menu, go with this one - it is bursting with flavors! Make sure to also try the coffee, the server will freshly press it right in front of you.   This menu is a little more pricey than the average so be prepared to spend more than expected. But there are many options so everyone can pick to their liking.

La Grande Orange is always delicious meal whenever I go and staff is very friendly.  Whether its the pizza, salad or appetizer, we always have a nice time in a relaxing and comfortable setting.  I have also heard from friends but not tried yet the breakfast - it is apparently one of the best breakfasts around.  Will need to go soon.  Whenever my mom is in town, we always make our way over to LGO.  One of our favorites is the grilled artichokes and brusselsprouts.  You cannot go wrong, trust me.    If you're looking for good wine for a good price, try this place.  Honestly, everything is excellent on the menu so whatever you go with, you're going to have a good meal.

This place always popped up as a high-rated restaurant on Yelp and after reading all the reviews, I decided to give it a try.  First of all, like everyone says this place is a true hideaway, there are no signs.  It is very small with only a couple tables, with dim lighting and rich wood as the decor.  Second, it is a delicious New Mexican/Tex Mex place.  As soon as you walk in the door, you smell the smoker and all the delicious flavors.  Our waiter was awesome, gave us very helpful tips on the menu and portion size.  The meals are very large, extremely hot and impossible to go finish unless you come on a very empty stomach.  My friend and I both tried the Carne Adovada, which isn't your typical Mexican but it sure was yummy.  The pork is so soft and it is marinated for hours in a rich chili sauce, you can really taste the smoker - it is so overpowering! Let me just say, the beans served with the carne were some of the best beans ever.    This is by far some of the best southwestern cuisine I have ever eaten!  Next time, I would really like to try some other dishes!!

If someone would have told me that I would eat one of my best seafood meals in Phoenix, you'd be nuts. Well it has happened. The Chilean Sea Bass at Wildfish is exquisite.  We loved the food so much, we actually came back a second night in a row to test out the happy hour (they have a bangin' HH) -- great bartenders too.  Great date restaurant located in Scottsdale that has a low key/lounge ambiance. Just be careful with the valet service, don't use it if you don't need to. Parking is available right there or below in the garage. Valet will actually cost you an absurd amount when the sign says "complimentary valet". Even if valet is not on the house, it should be for an upscale restaurant like this.

Came here once before but tonight was my first time on the patio. The patio is a great atmosphere with fun music playing, comfort seating and misters everywhere (except for our seat!). I asked the hostess if it was too hot to sit out there, she said no and then seated us away from the misters. We were HOT! Only downfall but should be expected in August.  I ordered the Ahi tuna salad which was good, last time I had the Lean & Green steak salad and would highly recommend this one. My friend had the market fish, similar to mahi mahi and absolutely loved it.  Randomly coming on a Tuesday night, we ran into the Tuesday special. A bottle of wine and an appetizer for $22! Can't beat that one! Overall, this is a great place for hangout, dating, brunchin' and always good food! They tend to keep the lighting very low but would prefer some additional lights or extra candles!

Love Love Love this place.  I have been to Roy's at many locations and especially enjoyed the Roy's on Maui, but this is one of my favorites.  This place is amazing with a reoccurring Hawaiian theme, whats not to love!  It is a mix of European techniques and Asian cuisine while meeting Hawaiian hospitality.  Honestly, I love the Seared Ahi Tuna and get this dish most of the times come. But when I decide to change it up, I am never disappointed.  For the appetizers we loved the crunchy golden lobster pot-stickers, for the salads we loved the roasted beet salad and grilled pear salad and for the entrees (besides the Ahi Tuna) the crab dynamite baked barramundi is delicious(a little rich so be prepared),  the mahi mahi and Hawaiian style misoyaki butterfish is absolutely mouth watering!!! If you are reading this, you must go and try :)  I also heard from one of my friends that the filet mignon is one of the best around.  I have not had the chance yet to give it a whirl. So maybe a surf & turf next? Last but not least is the dessert.  This may be my favorite at any restaurant out there.  Roy's Chocolate Souffle.  A delicious chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream and a tad of raspberry sauce - it literally melts in your mouth.  This is a MUST, make sure you order it!  Remember, there is always room for dessert!  Monday nights are usually a fix priced 3-course menu, so you should check it out. Great deal if they still offer.  My friend and I have dined here many times and we have had some issues in the past with take-out food, so make sure your order is correct before leaving.  ALOHA!

Living so close to Zoe's makes it hard for an addiction, the food is great every time.  Whether is the simple Greek salad with grilled chicken (simple is an understatement and it is a must to add Zoe's Greek dressing over the caramelized onions yummy), the protein plate or the kabobs - Zoe's is always a delicious meal!! And I don't know what it is - if it is the marinade or the how the chicken is cooked, but the grilled chicken is to die for..literally. I am definitely a regular and will always be!

This was my first upscale, premiere dine-in movie theatre experience. It was fabulous, the seats are so comfortable and the servers serve (okay) food and alcohol! There is nothing better than this as long as you are drinking wine during a Jennifer Aniston movie! The theatre we sat in had la-z-boy recliners which you can fall asleep in at any moment. The previous theatre the last time I was here had regular seats, nothing special and paid extra for the ticket. It seems the type of seats vary per theatre so be aware if you buy tickets for a showing.  I don't think I will ever go back to your "typical movie theatre" if I have the option again!

This place is just gross.  But a good place to watch sports and that's it. Food is horrible.  Sometimes I am forced to come here for lunch during the work week. Is it bad when you don't want to order one thing off the menu??!   I will give props to the outdoor patio area but this place is just a straight up bar. There are many TV's for viewing and shouting, whichever you prefer.

Came here with my mom the other night for a nice dinner. I've been wanting to try St. Francis for years now, and finally did! We had to make sure we were going to the main entrance even though we were on a dirt path. But its the right way!!  Starting with the crispy fingerling potatoes, they were extremely tasty but just wish there was a little more crisp for me personally. The season was perfect. We also started with the wood roasted broccoli, which was amazing. The sauce that the chef pairs with this simple vegetable is delicious. It is a lighter sauce, with I think a tint of lemon... I highly recommend this one. Lastly, we shared a Pig Dip. That's right, a Pig Dip. One, this sandwich was heavy! I picked a half up and couldn't believe it! Second, the taste and caramelized onions were a hit on the sandwich. Our server was also very helpful and knowledgeable, which was nice for us.

There aren't many places in South Phoenix for lunch, but this is one of them - if you even know about it. Located on a golf course next to the golf shop. Always pretty good service here and food is decent. The sandwiches look good but I have only ever had salads.   Must try the course soon!

I only ate 3 things at Cien Agaves so that is was this following review is based on.  1. The chips and salsa are great. People were saying it was too watery, but I disagree it was extremely flavorful with great chips.  2. The classic margarita is 100% perfect. Not only was the taste perfect but they didn't wimp out on the tequila. The color was spot on.   3. The carne asada taco. One word, delicious. I think this might be the best taco is the valley. Everywhere I go I try their carne asada taco, and this place was by far the best. I am just unhappy it took me this long to find Cien!!!  I will return.

Great ambiance and atmosphere at La Bocca! Located right in the heart of ASU in Tempe, La Bocca has nice sized outdoor patio/indoor seating, fun music and good vibe.  Bruschetta is a must and always a great option to try a variety of the options! I have been here before and always a great meal. Whether its the salads, pizza or wine - just go for all 3 :)  Tonight we had the red sangria and it tasted a little different than usual. From my perspective the red sangria tasted like Christmas potpourri in a cup. Although that being said, the more you drank the more i was accustomed to the taste. Great unconventional twist on the red. Maybe give it a whirl and try the white!

Fun little beachy taco stand here in Phoenix. My friends and I have been wanting to try this place forever and we finally did which we thoroughly enjoyed. Everyone was very friendly and extremely nice while we were ordering. There are a bunch of tables that good give vibes and it makes you feel like you are somewhere you right next to the beach.   I tried the carne asada and grilled fish taco - both were very tasty. I didn't know there was rice and beans already on them otherwise I would have held off on them. Other than that, I really enjoyed Two Hippies and can't wait to go back!

Thoroughly enjoyed brunch at True Food when I was here on Sunday with a chicken sausage vegetable omelette.  This is a great place for people with dietary restrictions.  I really enjoyed brunch way more than the dinner menu, but I will need to re-visit to update my decision.    This place is a little more pricey but they stress the idea of a seasonal menu that nourishes your mind, body and spirit. Can't ask for more if it is all fresh food, they truly know how to be innovative with all healthy ingredients.  Also, try one of the fresh drinks, they are all super delicious.  Both drinks that my friend and I ordered, we both loved.  I had the Hangover RX (although I didn't need a hangover remedy).  True Food is in a great location in the Biltmore Fashion Park.  Indoor seating is nice, a little overcrowded, but outdoor patio is a great - of course in a cooler climate.  But it is relaxing if you get the chance, the misters are out.  Check this place out.

LOVE all of the Trader Joe's.  This one, the parking lot is a little tough and an odd size for the location.  Otherwise, always great produce for a great price.  Always walk in and walk out with a ton of groceries without spending a fortune. Such a gem!

Lunch Break is a nice little place for a quick lunch in the South Phoenix area off of 40th street.  They have sandwiches, wraps, salads, and soups that is always fresh food with a nice variety. The owners are extremely friendly, they are always willing to try new sandwiches on their menu. Their menu offers chips, macaroni/potato salad, cottage cheese and yogurt as sides to the combo. Prices are very reasonable.  They also have breakfast here, i have never tried but it is on my list :)

Food is decent but will not return again. Bugs and cockroaches in the bathroom. Highly recommend putting some money into this place and fixing it up.

Over priced for the food that was provided and poor service at this type of resort restaurant. Lunch for 6 of us with one drink cost over $200. Our server had to keep asking what kind of drink we wanted numerous times!  Our group started off with the cilantro hummus, which was extremely light and didn't taste like hummus. To be honest, it was more like baby food. To the main meal, I had ordered the special which was fry bread with cilantro chicken, beans, tomato, guacamole and sour cream - almost a taco (average). Everyone else had ordered a burger, which deemed the better option (better than average).  Location of this place is pretty in the Arizona Biltmore but wish it made more of a food impact on me rather than architecturally. Love Frank Lloyd Wright!!

Really cute restaurant on 7th street that's sits on the corner with both available seating inside and a  cute patio outside. I came for a late dinner with a group of friends, so we sat outside on a very chilly night. One of the managers was kind enough to start a fire pit for us! Two thumbs up for them! The servers were very nice and attentive to a big group.  Good variety of craft beers and food. I ended up going with a panini that was very tasty and filling. Will definitely come back and try out more of the menu!

I have tried La Santisima only once and I am already anxious for Round #2! You know when the line is out the door that is the food is delicious. Every meal that was brought out, I wanted to try!!   For my meal, I stuck with all tacos and tried the Carne Asada, Al Pastor and the Baha Fish Taco. They were all so flavorful with their own distinct tastes. All the salsas were different and I believe we tried all of them. They do have a pretty full bar so if you are in the mood, you can try it out. Many people were ordering the Horchata which I made the mistake of not ordering, so this will on Round #2's menu. I did stick with a Mexican Coke and it hit the spot!  I was very intrigued by the artwork, it made me feel like I was somewhere else outside of Phoenix. As I said, I cannot wait to return :)

Very upset about this place. My group of 8 coworkers came for lunch to celebrate my bosses birthday and all of us were excited to eat sushi. Well, we were excited but it did not feel like anyone from Stingray wanted us there. It almost seemed like we were a nuisance to them. Our server was rude and not friendly. No one went out of their way to make sure our table was doing okay. Not to mention we spent close to $800 by the end of lunch. The bartender was also inconsiderate. Our whole group was extremely disappointed with this experience.  I hardly ever give 1 star to a restaurant but when the experience is this bad, it must be known.

Tried Yogurtology for the first time and boy do I love it.  The way that the frozen yogurt comes out of the machine just makes it look so light and smooth!  This place is extremely clean and staff is friendly.  A variety of flavors makes always creates a big bowl of froyo if you're a mixer!  The one thing I don't like about the toppings area is the normal size of some of the candy.  What am I going to do with a KitKat, large brownie or yodel??  Although, it is a great idea to make your dream sundae - how am I supposed to eat that with my froyo.  Please provide a knife Yogurtology!!  Otherwise, this is a great place!

Fun area up north to pick pumpkins during the fall season. They have hayrides and a bunch of other activities for kids and adults during the other seasons as well. One guy told us about a sunset ride that would be nice to go on, which I would like to do. Horse back riding is also something they offer as well! There's so many cool things to try at this ranch! Will definitely come back :)

This one was always on my list to try so I decided to check it out for a early Sunday dinner.  First of all, this place is in a perfect location in old town (and yes there is a patio). My friend and I did some splitting of dishes and that was just great.   Started off with a sangria, which I would highly recommend, it was very flavorful and not your typical approach. For an appetizer, we went for the fondu, served with a Swiss type cheese along with pear, sausage and homemade bread. For the main course, we tried the fried chicken with brussel sprouts. The entree was served perfectly and they split it for us on two plates :)   Our server was very friendly and helpful. She kept trying to keep our fondue warm and lit outside, but the wind kept blowing the flame out! I will absolutely come back to try different items on the menu :)

Came to Arcadia Farms Cafe for brunch on a Saturday but there was no brunch menu.  Besides this, the food here is pretty delicious.  I enjoyed the chicken mushroom crepes in a cream sauce.  These were indescribable but it was a great creation and excellent prepared dish!  My friend had ordered one of the chicken sandwiches and said it was out of this world.    After living in Phoenix, I had no idea this place existed.  It is a cute smaller restaurant, tucked on the side of the street in Scottsdale.  Have not tried the brunch or dinner yet  but plan to in the coming months.

HOLY CONE-OLI!  I am addicted to Churn. It is the perfect ice cream shop with perfect ice cream. A traditional ice cream cone with 2 scoops of ice cream is all I need here. I have had the pleasure of trying the ice cream sandwich with fresh cookies and a little freezie, which are both amazing.   These hot nights are perfect for a quick stop to the ice cream shop, they will subside any craving immediately! Whether its the coffee flavor, mint cookie, Madagascar vanilla, coconut, chocolate, should I keep going....  I am so glad I came across Churn, it is one of the best things that has ever happened to me! I just love that ice cream :)

If there was halves I'd give this place 2-1/2 stars. Bar is in a great location, elevated on the second level in the downtown area. Outside bar is even better but they call this place a sports bar for a reason. Food is not the best by any means. I ordered a burger and it was okay.  Waitress had recommended the sweet potato fries to me and they were nothing special.    Overall, this is a good sports bar with mediocre food.  TV's are located throughout so you are bound to find whatever team you are rooting for!  Also, the men servers in a kilt is a little weird to look at so be prepared!!

Best bar on tap in the area! There are so many different beers, brewed here and elsewhere that are delicious. Combine that with a bomb happy hour, and this is a great place. It might be my favorite happy hour around around!  Just think about it, come here after work any weekday and enjoy some beers with pretzels and cheese. That will make any headache from the workweek go away!   I still haven't tried this place for dinner but I need to. As for the other food, it is good but nothing special. Try an Orange blossom, you won't regret it.  Also, yes yes, dogs are welcome here and they're pet friendly. The outside patio in the back is the place to set, if the weather permits!

Definitely a fan of this place. After my first experience, it was nothing like what I expected and reminds me of a personalized Panera.  I enjoyed a small summer chicken salad which was a nice size portion for a small.  The sandwiches and soups look delicious and I look forward to testing them out on one of my next visits back here.  The food is not expensive and the employees are friendly!  I thoroughly enjoyed the complimentary chocolate covered strawberry!

I come to Zoyo for afternoon snacks on some days and it is just a treat!  Picking your own flavor and making your froyo sundae with a variety of toppings is always the BEST!!  You feel like a child again.  I tend to load up on the chocolate fudge, maybe some peanut butter and cannot forget about the sprinkles!!

Impressed with this local gelato spot, after just returning from Italy - this is very comparable to what I was eating over there.The owner is Italian and wonderful to deal with. I'm surprised I saw this spot since it was kind of hidden!  I am excited my mom and I went here, definitely one of the more better gelato's around! Excited to return and try all the other favors

I immediately fell in love with this restaurant. From the secluded and hidden outside to the wonderful decor inside, this is a one-of-a-kind Phoenix place.   Food is exquisite. I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu. Started with the Fresh Mozzarella, bacon relish and caramelized onion (portion is small), but extremely tasty and the balsamic is delicious. Time to dip the bread! Next was the crispy pig ears, I was doubtful but after all the reviews about them, I just ordered. Glad I did. It's hard to get my head around of what they are, but the chef puts an excellent twist on these. Try them.  Pork belly, risotto, yellowtail and grilled mozzarella are on the list to order the next go around, which is going to be very soon! Happy hour is great here, such a variety on their drink menu. If you're looking for something strong, I suggest a Manhattan :)

Good sandwiches for a good price. The menu is shorter but the sandwiches are made right in front of you and then put through the toaster. Potbelly is comparable to a Subway but has more of a home feel. I would have never known what this place was until my friend told me. The name Potbelly really threw me off!  I had tried out the wreck, very tasty, and the meat was extremely thin sliced. As for condiments, I asked for a variety of some lettuce, onions, tomato and oil and vinegar...  Apparently they don't have vinegar!!! That's a staple and needs to be at every Potbelly!

Cafe Rio is one of my favorites! Everything I have ever tried here is tasty, flavorful and always fresh. Their tortillas are homemade and if you're lucky, you will be able to catch them rolling and pinning on the way to the hot stone.  The tacos, burritos, enchiladas are great but my all time favorite is the sweet pork quesadilla.  It is just perfect and made just right to order. Dependent on the day, I may cheat further with chips, salsa and queso.  Boy, do I love mexican food!  YUM!

Love. This. Place. This restaurant is just simply perfect. I love the atmosphere (chic), ambiance (cozy), cuisine (modern American) and located off the main street which gives it a more low-key feel. It is a smaller restaurant with a great outdoor patio and amazing decor both inside and out. And don't forget about the oak tree, oldest one around.  House brisket and biscuit was superb. It was rich but extremely flavorful. All of the cocktails are hand-pressed and exquisite.   Save room for a cup of coffee and if you're going to do that you may as well have some dessert. Coffee is amazing (and dessert). I will be back to try more!  An extreme fan of Chef Matt Carter! You definitely will not be disappointed, the best combo of service and hospitality for all!

Extremely tasteful Italian spot in north scottsdale that has a great wait staff and decor. There is a good sized patio if you want to sit outside.  Started off the dinner with a caprese salad and fresh ground pepper, fresh mozzarella is made daily in house. Don't forget the basil :)  Next course was the Margherita pizza. A thinner smaller pizza is a good way to describe the pie. Pizza can easily serve two, but if you're hungry you may want to order more. My only complaint was that the pizza was served cold and not straight out of the oven.    Last course was undoubtedly the winner, hands down. Apple "pie" (which is only seasonal and was told will be off menu soon). This was absolutely heavenly, served warm with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and caramel. The pie dough was perfect and the size will be able to serve more than one!   I enjoyed meeting Marco, the owner from Italy with a lovely accent! He visited our table at the end of the night and was very interested to learn how our dining experience was. It was nice to see the owner helping out around the restaurant. I would definitely return.

Love coming to this froyo place on this side of town. Most of the time they have great flavors but today they had the basic vanilla and chocolate, fruity pebbles, peach sorbet,  salty caramel, root beer float and a couple others. Can we maybe get a coconut in there?! Or something else normal, stop trying with all these fancy flavors! Also, would love if they added some brownie bites or cookie dough bites to the toppings... Just a thought.   Always a clean place!

Cowboy Ciao at the PHX airport may be the best place I've eaten in an airport, ever.  I got to the airport extremely early one trip and camped out here. The food was impeccable and the service followed right behind. It was a win/win situation for all.  It was still early so after discussions with the bartender, I enjoyed the breakfast enchiladas. Do yourself a favor and give these a whirl. If you're not in the mood for this kind of twist, I'm sure anything else on the menu is amazing and made to perfection.

I love this place!  Have been here several times now and it is an awesome outdoor 2-story bar with great music all the time! I'm giving this place 4 stars more for the atmosphere and bar.  Food is good with a twist on the Mexican side.  Carne asada is a little salty so I would steer away from that.  All I can say is margarita, margarita and margarita. They are so delicious. Mojito's are also on my list to try! Great place on Mill!

What happened to this place?! Completely changed their menu to not appetizing food and now the margaritas come out of tap!!! Also, the waitress wouldn't take our food order, said we had to go to the bar. Excuse me? You won't take our food order, just the drinks?  Very unfortunate because this used to be our go to place.

Tried this place the other night with a fellow Yelper! It's good to know that we have Chef Marmulstein in the area since he will be featured at the James Beard House.  Great atmosphere and ambiance at Salty Sow. Tried the crispy Brussels sprout leaves as a starter and that was great. Really enjoyed the crispy twist with the Brussels. Was a little upset since my first choice for dinner, rotisserie-roasted pork had just ran out. So my second option was the Asiago-Crusted Halibut, it was superb. My friend had the slow-cooked beef shoulder which came in a black iron pot.  All in all I enjoyed this place. Ordered the chocolate mouse truffle for dessert and YUM!

If your looking for a good breakfast in a completely casual setting, Matt's is the place. The griddlecakes (aka pancakes) and waffles were a light and melted in your mouth. My dad has the hash browns and he loved the twist on them. What the atmosphere lacks, the staff makes up for. If you want good breakfast food, eat here.

Great breakfast place. This restaurant is not on my side of town otherwise I would be here quite often! But first of all, the biscuits, the biscuits are delicious! Fluffy, light, flaky, buttery, served warm with butter is the perfect recipe.  I went with a traditional breakfast while I was here. Eggs, bacon (extra crispy), and potatoes. The eggs are made to the tee here which is always symbolic to the type of place your at. The potatoes and bacon were also tasty. I devoured my entire breakfast, while eating the warm biscuit first. Everything is reasonably price with quick service! I would love to come back since breakfast is my favorite meal!!

This place is sweet and spicy, but had no idea it existed! Very close to the Biltmore area, this will be a new go to Mexican restaurant. Started with the chips, salsa and guacamole and everything was great - salsa comes in the squeeze bottles.  Ordered the fish tacos and the otro salad with Carne asada and both were delicious! The staff are extremely friendly and helpful when I was making my dinner entree decision. I will definitely be back shortly to discover the other dishes that people are raving about. Oh yeah, the margaritas are perfect - fresh and tasty!

Evo is a neat Italian influenced restaurant in the heart of old town. I felt a comfy, vibrant and cozy vibe dining here last time. There is also a twist of modern decor. Staff is extremely friendly.  The Arancini which is a fried risotto ball with meat sauce is a greater starter to any meal. Love the meat sauce. But the highly recommended starter or entree is the Evo salad. Brussel sprouts, kale, Bosc pear, chèvre, pancetta, pine nuts in a sweet reduced balsamic is extraordinary. I still have dreams about this salad - which means I need to come back very soon!  I read that the wine is on tap in another review. Didn't try the last time I was there! Really looking forward to the salad, a pasta dish (since it is all homemade) or pizza and wine on tap for my next visit!

I did not enjoy my cupcake like I should have, although it was beautifully presented. I tried the birthday cake cupcake and it was just average, nothing special about it. I definitely want to give some more stars but it didn't satisfy my sweet tooth in any way. I am a dessert guru but this is not the place, cake is dr-dr-dry. Maybe next time I would try one of the chocolate cupcakes, if I go back.

Amazing addition to the Biltmore area! This is the best breakfast place around (get here early to avoid a long wait, especially on  the weekends). But to fill the void of waiting, Snooze so kindly enough has complimentary coffee from Guatemala for the customers waiting.   I have been here numerous times already and everything we tried is delicious. Highly recommend the pancakes. The pancakes are light, fluffy, sweet and never get soggy. OMG French toast is another hit. Corned beef hash, eggs Benedict, just plain eggs, Juans breakfast tacos would all be ordered again!  Make sure to come on an empty stomach - it's worth it!

My new favorite pizza place! Pomo is going to rank high on my personal list! The ambiance, service and don't forget about the food, was all amazing. I came here for lunch so next will be out on the town for dinner and boy I can't wait. The pizza, oh the pizza, is just delectable. The mixed trio bruschetta appetizer is also just splendid! Ending the meal with a cappuccino felt like I was in a small town in Italy. Way to go Pomo!  I have nothing but great things to say about this place and cannot wait to return! Whose in?! Ciao!

Different kind of a place here inside the Whole Foods and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Don't expect a fancy restaurant but more like a tavern as its name states.   Over 30 beers on tap, it's so hard to pick so I went with a beer flight of all the pumpkin beers which is $8. Better deals during happy hour 4-6 pm and on the weekends.  We started off with some snazzy blackened green beans - nicely seasoned and delicious. I had the camelback burger (no bun), green salad and was surprisingly tasty, cooked to my exact medium rare temperature. Friends had the Caesar kale salad with chicken and orange chicken wok. Both were okay.   But to top off our experience, our server was great. She was extremely friendly, helped with beer selections and offered us a tasting of one of her blueberry favorites! A great server always enhances experience in more ways than one!

Great new location in Old Town, I love Hula's and its retro modern environment. Service is friendly and the food has a great Hawaiian/Polynesian fusion twist. Hula's has a great bar and slight outdoor patio for the nice warm days in Scottsdale. Don't forget about the fabulous drinks - when my friends and I are feeling daring we go for the Scorpion bowl. Long colorful straws in a decorative bowl (with a flame) mixed with good company is always a winner. :)  There is a brunch available at Hulas on the weekend, which I have had several times with a couple mimosas and very tasteful.   Like I said earlier, this place has the perfect location and environment for an enjoyable and delicious meal in Old Town! Perfect walking distance from local shops and stadiums if you're here during Spring Training!

Cute little coffee shop near ASU. I stopped here before a meeting on a chilly morning and they were very friendly in the AM. I didn't get anything special, just a pour over coffee. They did have a bunch of danish that looked tasty, but didn't have the chance to try! But its a great place to meet someone for a hot drink or sit outside on a nice day to relax!

Lovely farmers market in north Phoenix. This market has a variety of goods for whatever you are in need for and believe it or not, it is nationally known. Before summer, all the vendors are set up in the parking lot and when it heats up they move inside. Go check it out!

Who doesn't love Flo's!  This review is only for their lunch menu, but let's face it - it is all delicious! The lunch menu is such a great deal for the food that is prepared for you. Tried the chicken chow fun and katsu chicken, and both dishes were fresh and extremely tasty. My mother and I both said, "Wow, this fried rice is amazing!" I would highly recommend for anyone needing an option to select. We both needed To Go boxes to bring the rest of our food home!  The interior decor kind of relaxes me and feels zen. I will be a regular of Flo's as long as their around!

Great atmosphere! Came here with a true Chicagoan which made the experience even better. I now want to go to Chicago for St. Patty's Day next year!  Italian beef, sweet peppers and extra gravy is all I have to say. Fries were okay. Beef is shredded so thinly with the perfect amount of seasoning results in a delicious sandwich.  Would highly recommend or the Italian beef and sausage sandwich. I think I will be craving this from this point on......  Was a little disappointed with the vanilla milkshake we ordered. Not the best.

Excited I found this sushi spot and even happier its in the Arcadia area! They really do have some great deals during their happy hour (and even reverse HH). This is a newer place, so they are still trying to get their serving responsibilities together so keep that in mind - but the servers are extremely nice. I love their sushi, sashimi, the menu is fabulous. The sake bombs are a great deal as well!   This will definitely be one of my favorites, I can already tell. The portions are well worth it and the design is so appealing you can't stop eating!

You can always expect a great filling meal from Pita Jungle. The staff is usually friendly and quick to respond (sometimes), which is always a good quality to have.  There are a handful of items on the menu that I love. To start it off, the Seared Ahi Tuna with Hummus is extremely tasty and a nice starter for the table. This comes with 2 pitas, that are always warm they are served. If you're not feeling the Ahi, try the chicken over hummus!!! Very good! Best hummus in town!  As for salads, I have had quite a few. Here's a quick list for some I recommend.  -Mediterranean Chicken Salad -Caribbean Salad -Wood Fired Salmon Salad  As for the entree's, I love the Lavosh Shawarma Wrap but all of the wraps always look delicious! I have had a traditional gyro and I am not too impressed.  This is a good start for this menu, because there are a ton of dishes I want to try, including the pizza!  Enjoy!

Awesome event at the local Sauce on Central and Camelback. They were very warm and welcoming for the Yelp crowd. A complimentary beverage to start off the evening was perfect. Sauce started our courses with three types of salad and warm bruschetta. I love Sauce's bread so I couldn't help myself from eating all the bruschetta. A roasted portobello/artichoke mix, caprese and a house-made meatball style were the three types that were served.  All delicious!  The next part of the meal was the carbs - all the pizza and pasta!  -Mac 'N Cheese -Pasta Red Sauce & Mozzarella -Traditional Pizza -(Can't figure out this pie)  The food was tasty and a perfect for a Thursday night, I had a great time!  It was also a pleasant surprise to win a free bag of Yelp goodies as a bonus! Great job Hailey and thank you.
