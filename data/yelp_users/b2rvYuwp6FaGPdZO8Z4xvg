Wow! Came here with family on a Monday night.  We sat on the patio and the view was great. . However that is where all the good ends.  We were a party of four and two kids and between us we ordered 4 meals.  We got two meals delivered and then nothing, the server just left.  Then, we got another meal, again with no explanation about where the last meal was.  After a few minutes of waiting,  the server stormed by in a rush to tell us that the flatbread was made incorrectly and that's what we were waiting on.  Meanwhile, I started to nibble on my chicken taco salad. ...and it was awful.  It was like canned chili meat thrown on  some spinach and  lettuce with an unappetizing blob of sour cream.  Missing the black olives the menu promised me, I thought I would ask for them.  When I did, the server literally turned and walked away from me before the sentence was out of my mouth.  Finally the flatbread came out, but it wasn't the made the way it was ordered.  When this was pointed out, the server actually said, well I didn't  hear you say that and whirled around with the food with no further explanation.  When it did  come back, the mushrooms had just been scraped off, which was not okay.  When told this, the server said, well what do you want me to do about it?  When I tried to  speak to the manager, the server interrupted and said you can tell me.  When I started to explain why we were unhappy, she tried to make excuses about her other 3 tables she had to serve and finally cut me off saying I'll just get you another server and walked away.   I did explain the situation to the "night manager" and she comped the terrible food and gave us a piece of cake.  Plus we did get a new server, who did much better. Overall, not a great experience and we won't be back.

If i could rate the food and service separate, the food would be 4 1/2 stars and the service 1 star. When we moved to the area, I was so excited to be fairly close to a someburros cause I love the food. The first time we visited, the girl at the register barely acknowledged our presence, let alone looked up at us, as we ordered. When we pointed it out to the manager on duty he apologized, and we were treated better.  However, the young lady was upset and glared at us our entire meal. In the end we wrote it off as a one time, bad day.  The second time we came, they got my order wrong and when I had the nerve to ask for it to be corrected, I was greeted with annoyance.  Once again I pointed this out to the manager on duty and he apologized profusely.  This time we walked away with a gift card.  The next time we came in, I of course used the gift card and the manager recognized me. I can assume that is why that visit went off without a hitch.   However, this time proved to be the breaking point. My birthday was a week ago. I tell you this because I got an email from them today regarding their new birthday special. Since my birthday was a week ago I assumed it was one of the regular emails were they were offering me a free entree because it was my birthday and it was just late. However, as we learned from the  rude manager on duty, we read it wrong, and it was only an informational email,  and therefore we would not be getting any discount. At no point, did the manager apologize for the misunderstanding or try to hide her irritation that I did misunderstand.  Customer service is a huge part of my eating out experience.  It's why i don't eat at fast food restaurants often.   As I told the manger, there are plenty of  places to get good Mexican food  around there, so we won't be going to Someburros again anytime soon.

This is a great place.  The food is super yummy and the service is always great.  My only complaint is that there is an off smell in the building.  Clearly that doesn't keep me away though,  the food is too good.  I do love that they have Legos to play with, but it would be great is they washed or bleached them every once in awhile, they are pretty dirty.  That and the smell are the only reason I docked a star.

Really good food, decent sized portions and good customer service. A tad bit high priced, $30 for two people and only one beer. However the hotchata was so amazing it made it all worth it....there are nuts and fruit in it, what?! I can eat my delicious horchata as I drink it? Yes please.

Based on the reviews we were excited to eat here.  It's in a sketchy strip mall, I probably would have passed on this place if it was dark.   The inside is tiny and seems not dirty, but not clean.  The gentleman taking our order was very nice.  He was interested in how we found out about them.   We ordered and then waited and waited and waited.  I guess it's good the owners kids were watching the disney channel so my kids didn't get antsy. After a good 25 minutes wait (at least we know it's freshly made) we got our food. The kids mini burritos were just that,  mini and the 8 year old wanted more food.  But I certainly wasn't going to order another and wait and wait.  I got a chicken taco that was boring,  I could have made it at home,  and a vampiro that was the best thing I ate here and it was just okay.  My husband had Carne asada tacos and was not impressed as the reviews that brought us here implied we would be.  We also ordered chips and salsa, which was the most disappointing part of the meal.  I'm pretty sure they were bagged chips (the broken bottom of the bag chips at that) and store bought salsa.   After the meal though was the worst.  My 4 year old daughter needed to use the restroom.   It was marked out of order, but one of the owners sons just came out.....and when a 4 year olds gotta go, well she's gotta go! Yuck! It was so dirty!  The floors were filthy and the toilet had a string hanging out where the handle should be to flush it. This is actually why I changed my original 3 star rating to 2.   Over all,  not impressed at all.  Actually quite disappointed. We won't be going back there again.

Went here for the first time yesterday.  Although it is clean and there was an okay selection,  I don't think I'll be back due to the extreme stink eye the loss prevention guy was giving me the entire time.   I was with my two kids, who were a little on the obnoxious side.  However they were not screaming and running. They were playing in the aisles,  looking at the toys and fighting over things..... As 7 and 3 year old sisters tend to do.   I'm pretty sure he followed me around for the last half of my time there and as I waited in line and mu kids wandered through the accessories, daggers were shooting out his eyes. I kind of felt like he thought we were going to rob him and wreck the place.  I found a couple pairs of shoes for my youngest that I promised her I'd buy. Or I would have left without spending any money there.   Pretty sure I'll only go back there if I have to.
