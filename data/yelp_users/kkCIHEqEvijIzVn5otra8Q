Yo THIS SPOT IS THAT LOW KEY FLAME. 1 of 4 higher end burger spots I like to attend. They even had great Mac n cheese. Staffs chill, they keep it very homely. Expect to pay 10-20 tho.

Yo I COME HERE EVERYDAY.... Wish they had a stamp card tho  {cough cough} great coffee and scones. They should make more banana bread. Also discount their baked goods later in the day. Other than that, this is the spot.

Staff here is SUPER CHILL...The strawberry lemonade here was flame, highly suggest. Traditional burrito was pretty tasty, wasn't the greatest burrito I've ever had but the combination with the lemonade made it easy for me to want to come back.

I have a space here on the 3rd floor (penthouse) and I must say, this is the best thing that's ever happened to me. The staff is great, the  events thrown here go smoothly always.    God bless The Cloak Room

This might be the best BBQ I've had in the southwest. This place is great. Do not go anywhere else. Get the the jalape√±o  cheddar cheese grits. It's lit.

I wish I could give this place 0 stars. I repeated my order multiple times and still got mixed up. I asked for a chile relleno burrito and they gave me a pork and rice burrito. Soooo pissed. The meat was trash. This place has become the Mexican version of McDonald's, the quality of ingredients are terrible. Order a side of chips and watch them dissolve a day later in their container.

the only thing keeping me from raging on the employees right now is the insert of bread they  give you with your sandwich. enjoy over paying for a worse version of jimmy johns. dont come here.
