Disclaimer: My margarita was perfect and I can't say for sure if that influenced my review of the food :)  Saw this place on "Check Please, Arizona" on channel 8 and was so excited to try it.  And wow, we were not disappointed at all!  In fact, the food far exceeded our expectations!    We had the molcajete with green sauce.  It's basically a giant hot lava bowl full of deliciousness and even though 3 of us couldn't finish all of it, I was still sad when I couldn't cram any more of it in my face.  We also shared a fish fillet with octopus and shrimp in a mushroom cream sauce.  It was also very good, but the star of the show was definitely the green sauce in that molcajete.  We are going back next weekend and looking forward to it!

We had a great experience!  This is a really nice place to go for special occasions.  The booths are so private with the curtains and the service is excellent!  The food is amazing and the experience is unique.

The white pizza is amazing!  Also had the cuban sandwich once and it was outstanding.  Love the beet salad too.  I could go on.  Everything we have tried has been very, very good.

Joe really cares about delivering great BBQ and a unique experience.  He succeeds at both.  Our favorite sides are the cheesy potatoes and the beans.  The pecan wood smoked meats are so good!

This place is one of our favorites.  The food is always great and the service is top notch.  The gyros, chicken shawarma, greek burger and greek fries are all amazing!  The lunch buffet is a good choice as well.

After having a baby, we got away from going here for a while.  We went back a couple of weeks ago and the food has gotten even better!  The hummus and the gyros meat are the best we have ever had!  The buffet is a thing of the past, but I'm glad because the food is a lot better when it is made to order.  The only thing I wish is that they would consider making fresh pitas instead of packaged.  The pitas are warm and tasty, but fresh home made pitas would be a nice twist that would further set this place apart.

Just great, authentic street tacos and other mexican dishes.  We love this little place and how it is set up in the middle of a small indoor mall.  Not only is the food great, but the service is excellent.  The next best thing to driving down to Rocky Point!

Worst Chili's we have been to.  We tried a sirloin steak meal and chicken fajitas. The food was just down-right gross.  The steak was the worst ever and the chicken for the fajtas tasted like they microwaved some frozen chicken product from Sam's Club.  To top it off, the service was just as bad as the food.

This is, by far, the slowest and most incompetently staffed Sonic I have visited. On my last three trips, I waited 15+ minutes for a small, simple order. I also noticed the car hops routinely take food to the wrong cars, then going back inside (for a long time) to figure it out.  When I finally received the orders, they were incredibly stingy with the quantity of the side orders and the quality was not up to standards of other Sonics.  I will avoid this location from now on.

We never have to wait long to see the PA and the onsite lab is very convenient.  The PAs we have met with have been very helpful and have never rushed our appointment.  They take time to really listen and have a conversation and come up with a game plan.

We tried this place a few months ago and the food was excellent!  The service was not all that impressive.  I would describe the service as clinical if that makes sense.  The atmosphere was very casual with music playing a little on the loud side. I can't remember what we had other than the short ribs, but all of our food was terrific!  The food was definitely five star food, but they can improve on ambience, service, and also food presentation.

Nice place, but...  Shady and deceptive business practices!    For starters, they gave us something called LTBucks when we enrolled for a family membership.  We used the LTBucks to pay for swimming lessons for our 18 month old.  We set up the days/times over the phone.  When we arrived with arms full of towels and daughter in tow, they gave us some papers to sign.  Turns out they were having us sign up for auto-billing of swimming lessons after the free ones expired.  When we called and told them we didn't want the paid swim lessons and requested a refund, they said they would not refund because we signed to authorize the charges.  What the $%#@ ever!  Yes, I signed what I thought were liability disclaimers while  holding my daughter with one arm and carrying all of our stuff on the other and no one on LTF's staff ever mentioned this policy or explained what I was signing.  We also started receiving magazines in the mail after joining.  The magazine was never offered or mentioned during enrollment and we just threw the magazines away.  Then, we started noticing charges for the magazines on our account.  So, then my wife decides she wants to cancel her portion of the membership.  We call to cancel and they say that we have to come in to cancel!  Another shady way to try to get more money out of us before we cancelled that portion of the membership.  At that point, I decided that this type of company doesn't deserve another penny of our money.  I went to the gym to cancel the entire membership.  Instead of offering to make things right, they just proceeded to tell me that we have to give them one month notice to cancel and that they are going to charge another month.  Well, good luck LTF! Card cancelled and I dare you to come knocking or calling for money that you can't earn honestly.  It's really a shame that they feel they have to stoop to the level of other gyms that use the same tactics.  The facility is nice and they shouldn't have to trick people to give them money.

The food at Pho 68 is great!  Probably better than the other vietnamese place next door which I gave 5 stars.  The reason Pho 68 doesn't get 5 stars is because of ambience and service which are not as good.

I had high expectations based on the reviews. Unfortunately, we were not impressed at all with the food or the service.  The appetizer was good (crepes with mushrooms and pancetta), the bread was hard and had no flavor, the chicken marsala tasted like cheap frozen chicken breasts with and the sauce was sweet and had a maple syrup taste to it. Yuck! The rigatoni with vodka sauce had a very good sauce, but the rigatoni was not homemade and it was too firm. The tiramisu was excellent. Oh, also no brewed iced tea, just the fountain stuff. Very disappointed :(

We decided to try this place because of the Yelp reviews.  We did take-out and ordered a regular crust with meatball pizza and some medium wings.  The service at the pick-up counter was average to good.  The wings were ok, but the pizza was not good at all.  There was hardly any sauce or cheese, and the crust was chewy to hard in texture.  Honestly, it was one of the worst pizzas we have had.  Maybe we caught them on an off night, or maybe it is better to dine in.  We wanted to love this place, but unfortunately, it didn't go as well as we expected from the reviews.

The worst drive-thru experience ever. It took over thirty minutes to get my order with just 6 cars ahead of me. Then, they forgot my drinks and I had to go back. 45 minutes later, my family got to eat cold fish tacos and cold fries. Yum! The employees could not care any less if they tried. Nobody offered up an apology for the slow service or any show of appreciation for waiting.

Great dentist and super friendly, efficient and professional staff!  My wife and I have been seeing Dr. Ray for several years and we always have a great experience. We have both done Invisalign and teeth whitening treatments and those have worked just the way we wanted.  We have referred several family and friends and will continue to do so.

We have been taking our 2 year old daughter to Great Play for a few weeks now.  She absolutely loves it and gets so excited when we tell her we are taking her there.  The coaches do a great job and there is always something different for her to try.  We like how she is developing motor skills and social skills at the same time.  But, her favorite part is the mascot "Buddy" and singing songs.

My wife is from Peru and she introduced me to the delicious cuisine of her country.  Over the years, I have tried Peruvian food around the Valley, and around the world, including Lima.  The food at Tumi is very good and is the best we have had in the Phoenix area.  Highly recommended!

This review is long overdue!   As a former banker for 15 years, I am totally blown away by the level of service that this bank delivers.     We absolutely love the staff at this branch and their professionalism.  Other branches we have visited have also been outstanding with service.     As a bonus, MidFirst offers great options to not pay any fees and we can use any other bank's ATM's free of charge!     We have referred many friends, family members and clients and they all love this bank, especially this branch!

We did carry-out.  We are not experts on authentic Chinese or Szechuan food, but we thoroughly enjoyed the won-tons in spicy/sour sauce, the Kung Pao Chicken, the Hunan Beef, and the pork fried rice.  Everything was delicious and seemed to be made to order.  We'll definitely be back.

I have been going to this gym for a few months now.  It is always super clean, I have never had to wait for equipment, and the staff is friendly and helpful.  If you are looking for a low-cost gym to join, I highly recommend this one.  If you need a swimming pool, sauna, showers, or childcare at your gym, then this place would not be right for you.  To avoid any hassles that are typically found at gyms with monthly drafts and cancellation policies, I just paid up front for a one year membership and didn't have to give my bank account or credit card info for future charges.

For this price range, Cafe Zupas definitely earns 5 stars! You could spend as much at many other places and not come even close to the quality of the food or the experience.  First time here, and will definitely be back. I had the chicken pesto sandwich and the tomato basil soup. Perfect!

I can't believe this place has no reviews!  I found it on Yelp when we were on the other side of town and craving some helados.  They had lots of Mexican desserts on the menu and on display to get our mouths watering.  We chose ice cream and strawberries with cream.  The ice cream was really good,but the strawberries and cream was one of those desserts that I will never forget!  Amazing!  The vibe in the place was very casual and very cool with murals all over the walls and families hanging out and enjoying hot food and desserts.  We can't comment on the hot food, because we didn't try any.  But, we would love to go back and try and of course, save room for dessert!

Wow!  We found this place on Yelp when another nearby restaurant was closed.  We will be back for sure.  We had the crab puffs, the Indonesian fried rice and the braised beef in curry.  Everything was excellent.  The braised beef in curry was incredibly tender and tasty.

The food and service are very good.  If the prices were about half of what they charge, I would give it 4 or 5 stars.  But, street tacos just shouldn't cost this much.  Last time there I had the chicken mole plate.  It was way too sweet for my taste.

You can definitely tell that the owner and staff really care about quality and creating a unique experience.  We had the gumbo, the chowder and the cioppino.  All were excellent and the server was great.  The only negative was that the food took a little longer than we would have liked.

My advice is to steer way clear!  We seriously do not recall feeling more like a business could care less about us as customers.  Ultimately, this place lost a potentially long-term student over $15 and a seriously rude woman at the front desk!  Our credit card that they had on file had been lost and replaced while we were out of town on a trip.  I took my 3 year old daughter to class the next week and put her in class.  I was already walking to the front desk to give them our new card when I bumped into the teacher walking her back up to the front desk.  The teacher had pulled her out of class and started walking her to the front desk without looking for me first.  What was our 3 year old supposed to do about updating the credit card?  And...couldn't the teacher have waited for a break, or just come out and asked for the person in charge of her and then asked me to take care of the issue at the front desk?      Then, I got to the front desk and learned that we were going to be charged a $15 late fee.  We had never had any previous billing issue or fees waived.  Before I could even open my mouth to explain and ask for a one-time forgiveness, the woman at the front desk gave me a "I don't give a #@!$ about what you are about to say, you owe us a late fee and there is nothing you can say that will make me waive it so don't even bother trying" look.  I told her politely that "this is the type of thing that will make us take our daughter out of here." She looked at me as if that would give her great pleasure and said "Ok." So, I signed the credit card charge including the $15 and said (again very politely) "Can we go ahead and take care of that withdrawal form then?" And she quickly grabbed me the form and kind of threw it on the counter and said "here you go".  I had never even dealt with this woman or been any sort of a problem customer, AT ALL.  So, I am not sure why she treated me like dirt.    This incident served as confirmation of how we had been feeling about the Dance Loft.  We have a 3 year old and we felt like this place was all about the money and not about creating a great experience for kids and parents. For parents of preschoolers, the winter recital was a joke. Our daughter danced for 3 minutes in a nearly 2 hour performance that was just a big money grab for the studio. We were embarrassed that our family and friends, who just wanted to see our daughter dance in her first recital, were required to pay for tickets to an hour and a half of watching other peoples kids, most of them older students.  There are so many students that they had split the day into 3 or 4 performances.  So, why not put all of the little kids in one of the performances and make it shorter and much sweeter?  The whole thing was just a big money grab for the studio. Uggh

Our 3 year old absolutely loves it and we like it because the pizza is not bad and the salad bar is better than one would expect. Every game is only one token, so you don't have to spend a fortune for your little one to play a lot of games.
