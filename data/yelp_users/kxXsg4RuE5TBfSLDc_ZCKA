My boyfriend and I went out to dinner last night... we were trying to think of a good Mexican food restaurant to go to and I decided why not macayos its been a while since I had been there. Its been hard for us to find good service lately, i dont know what it is.... Our Servers name was David he was right on top of everything. I work in the restaurant industry so im very picky. He brought refills before they were gone, stopped to ask if we needed anything before the meal came out, and after we got our meal he came back by to see if everything was good. very consistent! but he wasn't just on top of us he was on top of all of his tables. Food was great... Great service... will definitely be back again!

I give this no stars! This was the worst expierience ive ever had. Not only was the staff rude, our food was disgusting. The lady upfront TAKING ORDERS didnt even speak english so didnt understand what I was even trying to order. The pizza had no sauce as you CAN SEE.. The pepperoni's were not cooked. It didnt even taste like pizza. More like cardboard. We ordered a philly special and asked for mushrooms on half of it due to an allergy that my husband has to mushrooms. The lady was completely rude and said they couldnt do that. Umm ok?? Still not understanding why.. She said they could do it that time only. We sit down and they come and ask us if we want the tomato sauce on the philly.  It is called a steak SPECIAL people, that is the only one that comes with tomato sauce on it.. Why would you ask that? Its like they dont even know there own recipes! The philly came out with mushrooms on the whole thing and the bread was soggy. The sauce came on the side watery , didnt even taste like tomato sauce. I dont usually write reviews but this one made me get the yelp app! Do not eat there unless you want rude service and gross food.

Me and My Boyfriend wanted to go out for a nice dinner, he had never been to firebirds so I wanted him to try it. We walked in there was a 20 minute wait. We waited patiently than we were sat and the lady walked up didn't even introduce herself just asked what we wanted to drink. Then she dropped off the drinks and walked right away, when she finally came back she asked what we wanted to eat, my boyfriend ordered steak and I asked her what does she recommend, she was no help she just said steaks are good salads are good, ect. So i ordered a salad with chicken. Our food comes out and I take my first bite and then i notice there is a hair in my food... so I sit patiently not eating my food and my boyfriend started to eat, she walks by and asks my boyfriend how his steak was but didn't acknowledge, so I told her there was a hair in my food, she replies do you want the same thing or something else? no apology...  Than the manager brought me my salad and than apologized. She came by a little bit after and said I hope it wasn't a hair from my pony tail, you don't make jokes about something like that.  Its hard for me to go anywhere because I work in a restaurant but I try to be fair. This was the absolute worst service Ive ever had... ive had better service at chick fil a. Will not return.

I hate to write a bad review because when we walked in everyone was so nice.. But nice can only go so far. We ordered steak and chicken fajitas and when our order came out it was chicken and shrimp. When we told our waitress she tried to just tell us oh but the shrimp is so good and i only charged you for the chicken, but thats not the point. We didnt order shrimp.. And it isnt what we wanted. So then they ended up cooking us a side of steak but then when we asked for more tortillas she told us she would have to charger us, yet you messed up our order? So we said thats okay we are fine. & then our bill comes and we were charged for two pepsi's when we ordered one iced tea and one water. So we told the lady we only ordered one drink, and she said ok ill take that off, when she took the bill back we also handed her $40.00  she came back and opened her book on the table and started to count out my change.. Which i thought was weird because normally you do that in the kitchen or at a computer instead of looking for change and saying you dont know if you have it, so i told her dont worry about the change part of it. So the total was 20.89 something around there and she handed me back 14.00 so she shorted me $5.00 by then I was ready to just get out of the place so I left but wanted to let the resturant know I did tip her $5.00 on top of this... Just in case she accidently did count the change back wrong or idk if she was taking out her own tip? Either way I was bothered by this expierience this whole day and I will not be returning because of this.

The service here is always great. We usually sit in the bar, good atmosphere, Always on top of refilling chips and salsa, drinks, and very consistent! The Mexican pizza with ground beef is amazing!

Kay is the only Jewelry store I will go to! Very nice selection... I love my ring I got. you can stop in anytime and they will clean it. The staff are all very polite, and when we bought my ring they told us that when were ready to upgrade we can bring the ring I have now in and they will give us full value for it, were almost ready to upgrade so we will see how that goes!

I went to chili's on the 4th of july we wanted to get some food before we watched fireworks we went about an hour before. a guy introduced himself and said him and another girl were going to be our servers. he took our drink order, My boyfriend ordered a margarita and I ordered iced tea he asked if I wanted lemon I said yes please. A good 5 minutes went by and a girl brought over our drinks, my tea had no lemon. She asked if we were ready to order we said yes. My boyfriend ordered a burger with bacon cooked well done, with no lettuce. & I ordered soup/salad and she told me I couldn't order that its only a daytime thing. she was very rude. So I then changed my mind to a buffalo chicken salad. she then asked my boyfriend im sorry what was your order. Really?.......  I asked for chips and salsa to come out first. So as time goes on... Never got lemon for my tea, a couple sits next to us gets there drinks in 2 minutes and there appetizer hits their table and then 10 minutes later there food hits the table. So now we had been there for at least 15-20 minutes and our chips and salsa hadn't even came out.. yet the table next to us is almost ready to leave. Every time we would ask the lady for something she was rude... short. and you could tell she was trying to avoid us. So by now I was frustrated, my boyfriend stopped the server and asked for our bill. we wanted to pay for the drinks and go. at this point we did not want to stay. she made us feel very uncomfortable. she didn't ask why... or is everything okay? she just walked away went and grabbed the bill with everything on it and then took his credit card. My boyfriend got up and found a manager and explained the situation said we don't mind paying for our drinks but we don't want the food anymore it had been 30 minutes and still no sign of chips and salsa.....  he apologized and comped everything, which was nice. but im very disappointed in Chili's, not sure if I will be back.

Our first time trying Mi Familia last weekend, Right when we walked in, we werent sure how it worked if someone was supposed to seat us or if we could just sit wherever. Someone immediately approached us and welcomed us in to sit wherever we'd like. Our waitress was awesome! So nice and had lots of good recommendations for food, the machaca beef is amazing! Also if you like bloody marys, they are awesome here! Will be back for sure.

Ive given this place plenty of trys.. I keep going back because I enjoy the food at the peoria location. The staff here is rude. We ordered a bean and cheese burrito and they had charged and gave us a all beef burrito. We had to drive back up after getting home.. Which we all know is the worst! And when we had gone back the lady acted irritated with us like it was our fault? And then didnt offer to give money back to the difference of price in beans from the beef burrito. We had to ask for the difference $. Then she says they cant really hear through the drive thru speaker, well hmm.. If you knew that then why don't you repeat peoples orders when they get to the window.. Even MCDONALDS does that. Its amazing how bad customer service can make you quit going to a place! No matter how much you like the food.

At least im not the only one here to say.... Rude customer service! I mean seriously put a better girl upfront because I was ready to walk out the second she started taking my order. Made me feel so uncomfortable and like um hurry up what do you want. Also it took 30 minutes to get a lemonade. I understand your busy and the food may take some time. But when I was a server I was taught your table should have beverages within 5 minutes of them sitting down. Get some better employees cuz these ones got to go! At least the very RUDE one up front!!! I was there last sunday morning ... Im sure you can narrow it down to who was working then!
