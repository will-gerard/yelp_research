Woke up in the morning with a craving for some comfort food. My awesome girlfriend worked overnight so she was not able to appease my insatiable appetite for some authentic Mexican food on this gorgeous Saturday morning. So I did what any guy would do in my situation.. Yelp "best Mexican breakfast".  After sorting through some establishments with mediocre ratings I came across Mi Patio. Hmm a four star..of course I was instantly suspicious as Phoenix has not delivered on quality Mexican food since my transplantation from San Diego ten years ago. I was, nevertheless excited, as I made my way to this centrally located cocina.  As I entered I was greeted and seated promptly. I was the first customer aside from 2 at the bar having a Bloody Mary. The hostess was quick to bring coffee, water, chips, and salsa to my table which I immediately partook of.  The coffee was hot but possibly reheated. Needless to say I had 3 cups of the cafesito. The chips were very good.. Hot and fresh. The accompanying salsa(which definitely spent the night in the fridge)was ok a bit on the salty side.  I have had worse but also much better.  For my platillo I ordered the carne asada, enchilada combo with rice and beans. The presentation was ok as I immediately noticed the cheese overkill. The plate was drowned in the yellow stuff. The server warned me as she brought out the supposedly hot plate towel in hand. My first bite of the arrozito debunked this myth of hot food out the kitchen.  Having had my first bite of the rice  I hesitantly tried a mordida of the cheesy beans and bistek. As previously mentioned the beans were not distinguishable amongst the sea of yellowness. The carne was ok nothing to write home or yelp about. The final disappointment to this dish was the flour tortilla that came on the side wrapped in a steaming foil. As I unwrapped its silver lining and handled it I could see and feel this was a sorry store bought excuse of a tortilla    Taking a forced bite confirmed my suspicions.  Unfortunately  I will not be coming here again. The service and staff seemed nice. The food however is below par from what I'm accustomed to.

I really enjoy this place for breakfast. Really comfortable seating and nice ambiance.  I like the sausage and egg with cibatta.  Prices not a steal but comfortable enough. Coffee selection is nice as well
