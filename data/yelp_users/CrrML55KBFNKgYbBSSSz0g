Delicious burger close to home when I've got a craving for red meat. You'd never know it by looking at it but their burgers are very good and made to order.  The moderate drive through wait proves worth while for a freshly cooked burger. Just wish there was a "without the fries" option. Although they're good too.

I got a massage via a groupon. During the first 20 or so minutes anything from the AC unit on high, to the other front desk person talking loudly to the kid running and screaming, it was not the best massage experience I've had. I'm going to take a guess that the massage therapist was new to massage. Giving her the benefit of the doubt, I tried to relax into the massage and she found her groove, the kid was now gone and the front desk person began speaking softer.   It turned around alright until I went to leave.  I left what I felt was an appropriate tip considering the less than professional atmosphere.  Then I was told I owed $12 for gratuity.  Now I'm not a massage veteren but I've had more than enough to know that unless I was a party of 8 eating at Olive Garden, gratuity is not determined for me.  I was a bit dumbfounded.  I mentioned that I had left cash in the room, so the other employee went to retrieve my tip so I could put the rest of it on my card.  What was especially bizarre is that she pulled out her iphone and square to apply my charge.  It seemed very under the table. Once again, I need to read yelp before I buy anymore Groupons, Living Social or any other coupons.
