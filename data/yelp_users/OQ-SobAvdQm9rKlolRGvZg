I've been here a few times and each time was amazing!  The pad Thai is worth writing home about and the temple of fire has just the right amount if spice.  Not only is the food, good it is also consistent. The service is friendly and never keeps you waiting too long!

I have been going to Ide Mania for several years now. They know be my name because I am there every two weeks like clock work. Lili is the greatest esthetician you could ask for.   My very first visit I came in for my brows and was nervous because having someone shape your brows is serious business. She listened to what I wanted but more importantly she knew what would compliment my face. Lili has never failed to provide me with knowledge and great customer service.   In addition to my brows of perfection, she also does amazing manicures. She always made me feel like I was at a girls night and we would talk about the possible color options or adding glitter.   I've had a few of the girls cut my hair and each time was very happy. I don't cut my hair often so that's saying something.   I truly feel like a part of the Ide mania family and would highly encourage anyone to go there. Tell Lili I said hello!

Very impressed! I came here on New Yrear's day because my other breakfast spot was closed so I figured why not try something new. Right when we walked in, it was packed full. I figured it was just due to the holiday and accepted the 25 min wait time. Once seated we had excellent service! I was so amazed by how great our waitress was even though she had many other tables. The food was DELSIH and man what a big portion!  The only reason I am giving 4 starts out of 5 is due to the wait time.  This establishment is certainly worth the wait.

I went here on 12/13/14 around 1pm and wanted a late breakfast, however on saturdays they stop serving breakfast that late. So I decided to just go with lunch. We ordered the Pretzel bites that was said to come with a spicy jalapeno cheese dip....which ended up being the creamy spinach dip? I think they need to update their menu because that was very misleading. The food was alright, not bad, not great. The service however left something to be desired. It feels as though they treat their regualrs really well and the newbies have to get hazed with bad service.  I wont waste my time on this place again.

Okay...let me start by saying I am shocked at how many people gave this place a good review.   I will be generous and start by saying some of the positives. Food was fresh... I would even call it tasty. It had a good atmosphere with a lot of potential.  However, everything was over priced, portions were on the lighter side, and the service was TERRIBLE. It took between 8-10 min just to order drinks. The waitress acted as if she'd never had a table in her life. The kids menu was on receipt paper.....and when ordered the kids cheese crisp...there was nothing crisp about it.  When we were getting near the end of our meal, the bus boy came and started collecting things as if we weren't there. He started to take things that we weren't done with and when we told him we weren't done, he looked annoyed and disgusted.   This place was beyond dissapointing.
