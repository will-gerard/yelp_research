Worst customer service EVER.   LEARN TO ANSWER YOUR PHONES.   They never answer their phones, and if by some OFF chance they do, they say they have something and then when you go down there to pick it up, THEY DON'T HAVE IT. Or anything remotely close to what you asked for in the first place.  Thanks but no thanks. They will no longer be getting our business.

I always enjoyed coming here after a long night of work. The staff is amazingly friendly and always made my time here great.  The sliders are yummy and their appetizer platter they offer is great. You can choose between a variety of different munchies.   Over all I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a low key, bar atmosphere.

This is the worst machine shop to go to. I went there to get my 350 crank polished and balanced, well they polished and balanced it BUT, they did a half a**ed job leaving nicks on main journals and rod journals. And they took a grinder to the crank shaft counter weights and grinded the crap out of them to "balance" it.   The owner is cranky and rude and says if his shop breaks it, its not his fault and won't take responsibility for any parts that are broken. Anything you say, he says is the wrong way and there is only one way to do things and its his way.   Not only do they have crappy customer service, but they do horrible work..... FAIL

I had high hopes for this place since I have visited here before.   I ordered the taco salad with chicken. When it came out the cheese looked un appetizing, The tortilla bowl they served my guac and sour cream in was already soaking from the chicken juice. The salad was warm and soggy.   I also had to get up to ask for more water after she had stopped by to see how everyone was doing drink wise.   Hopefully this can be improved. I will not be ordering this dish again.

If you haven't had the dynamite roll... you must try it. It is amazing!!!! And they have red snapper shashimi here so delicious.   Not a big fan of the vegas roll this particular place serves.

My sister and I decided that we wanted sushi. We went to this place because it was close to our house and we had both of our kids.   We got there and the lady sat us and then attended to her other tables. We sat there for a good while staring at her waiting for menus. We had to ask another gentleman who also got us our waters.  She was very rude and when we asked for things like soup she would stare at us and walk away.   She only had two tables and barely came over to us. When we got our check we needed to split it as I was explaining what we wanted to do and she walked away. We couldn't understand her half the time because she was so quiet.   To be honest the sushi was mainly rice with barely any "meat" to it. Out philly rolls were the tinest I have ever seen.   Their happy hour isn't even happy hour. Just a buy one get one special.   I will not be spending my money here again.

This is my all time favorite pizza place. Their buffalo chicken pizza is the best.   Great service and their selection of local beers is awesome. They have a good happy hour as well. I recommend this place to anyone.

I work at starbucks so you can imagine my disappointment when my drink was made wrong. Please pay more attention to what your customers say. That and smile. Y'all look like you hate your jobs.

I did not like smashburger at all!  The people were super friendly but the food was not good at all.   Deserves zero stars. The burger didn't taste like a burger at all. There was barely any lettuce or bbq sause (I got the bbq and bacon burger). It was bland and just not tasteful at all.   I do not know what all the hype is about this place. I will never return here again.   Save your money, go elsewhere.   The meat was nasty (tasted like chewy dense cardboard), there wasn't enough sauce on the bbq bacon burger. Just over all not good. I won't be going there again.
