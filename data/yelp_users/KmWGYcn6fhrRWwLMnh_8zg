Well let me start by saying. I don't really eat Taco Bell but I decided to try their new product. Quesalupa steak   And I was very disappointed!! It was horrible. First of all No cheese and very little steak. And this is the last time I will STEP FOOT AT TACO BELL.  FAKE Mexican food.

Coffee is horrible. ....it all depends on who is making the coffee but most of the time it's bad. Their customer service its great. But you can tell that they are trying too hard to be nice.
