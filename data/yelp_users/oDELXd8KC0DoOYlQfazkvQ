While this style of food may appeal to some, it's just not for me. At the recommendation of a friend, we were told to try the tacos. The chicken tacos arrived in what appeared to be homemade taco shells. The shells are thicker and seemed to be deep fried and a little greasy. The chicken (as another reviewer stated) is deep fried. Honestly, this tasted like Kentucky Fried Tacos to me, and since I'm not a fan of fried chicken, this wasn't an enjoyable meal.   My wife got the Caribbean Martini and while she said it was delicious, the martini glass wasn't filled close to the top.   I'm giving it 2 stars (rather than 1) because the service was good and the menu is priced well.

Loved this place!  We're new to Phoenix and happened upon this restaurant by accident.  We looked at the menu and decided to get the 3 tacos for $5.00 and a bottle of water for $6.00 total.  Menu prices include tax and they accept cash only.  I had 2 chicken tacos while my wife tried a fish taco.  Included on each taco is:  Beans, cheese, tomatoes, onions, shredded cabbage, rice, a choice of meat, which green sauce and red salsa on the side.    These aren't tiny taco bell tacos.  These things are huge and delicious!  My wife loved her fish taco and the chicken tacos were also fantastic.  We can't wait to go back.    My only wish was that I had black beans on my tacos instead of pinto beans, but my wife looked at their menu online later and found that I could have requested them.  A minor error I shall correct on our next visit.
