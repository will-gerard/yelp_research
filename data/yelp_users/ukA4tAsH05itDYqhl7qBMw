Yikes.. I should have checked the Yelp before going here for my FIRST EVER CRAB LEGS EXPERIENCE. Is this place specifically designed to annoy? As we sat there eating very mediocre crab (it's not supposed to taste really fishy right?), the volume of the music doubled and all of the employees line danced to "COTTON EYED JOE" by Rednex which is possibly the most annoying song of all time. This lasted roughly two minutes and was followed by a Smashmouth song. To add to the annoyance factor, there are multicolored Christmas lights strewn throughout the restaurant and the staff wears tie-dye shirts. Thinking about it is giving me a headache. Would maybe go back as a joke. The hush puppies were good.

Pack a ton of meat down in the bowl using the tissue paper they supply. Pile veggies as high as you possibly can. Use double the amount of sauces recommended for the recipes. I skip the noodles, why pay for them to cook filler when there's free brown rice available POST GRILL? With this method even after stuffing yourself you should have enough leftovers for rougly 3 more meals.

I ate here for the first time last year. Any place where you can get RED KOOL AID DRANK is okay in my book. I had the chicken and waffles, why try anything else on the first visit? Would be nice if they offered a nap room for the post meal food coma. This will knock you on your ass.

Long live the Trunkspace, an awesome venue run by good people. I've probably seen over 100 shows there over the years, and even played a couple. Always a good time.

Bought the Groupon for Malee's a few months ago and had my first ever Thai food experience! This place seriously blew my mind, I could not stop talking about it for days. Specifically the Thai Toast and CRISPY BASIL CHICKEN. Thinking about it right now is actually making me hungry. I hate myself for not trying Thai food earlier. I'm not sure how close to traditional Thai fare my meal was, but as far as I'm concerned it was an excellent intro.

I had my hair cut by Mark at Vidal Sassoon yesterday, and I'm so pleased with how easy my hair is to manage today that I'm yelping. I've had many experiences where my hair will look good right after a cut, but when I style it myself later everything goes to hell. Not this time, my cowlick has been tamed. It's like magic!  The haircut experience itself was excellent. Vidal has a very pleasant and comfortable atmosphere, and Mark took his time with the cut. I feel that a proper haircut should take some time and thought, and that's exactly what I got here. Highly recommended!

Nothing positive to say about this venue. I am always disappointed when a band I love plays here.

Haji Babas is really the best. I live a few blocks away and eat there at least once a week. I usually order sides.. some combination of: hummus, chicken kabab, koobideh, and falafel. I also get a large container of the "garlic sauce", and literally put it on anything I eat at my house until it's gone.

Hell yeah. I've eaten at Shane's every Tuesday since I've been working in the area (since September 09). TENDER TUESDAY FTW. Tenders, a side, and a drink for $7.. just recently raised from $6.50. Seriously just awesome chicken tenders.. nearly on par with Rock N Roll fingers in Tempe. I used to get mine tossed in Teriyaki sauce but now I just get them plain. They also offer grilled tenders which I may switch to in the near future. The side of fries is obscene. I have trouble with self control when it comes to eating and would always attempt to finish all of the fries and tenders which nearly always resulted in hurt. I have switched to the green beans which are both delicious and healthy.

Bought a weighted vest here and upon trying it out at home, I determined that it didn't fit right. I had read online that they did not accept returns, so I was a little bit skeptical when I took it back to exchange it for a used olympic lifting bar I had seen there. They gladly exchanged it for me! I have no complaints about the experience.  This shop has lots of useful stuff that larger chain stores like dicks, sports authority etc do not carry - kettlebells (cheapest I have seen ANYWHERE), pylo boxes, lifting gear. I will be back!!!

Honest, reliable, efficient, friendly! I can't express how helpful it is to have a quality shop like Babbitt's in town.

The chicken shawarma is stellar. I get it to go at least once a month, substituting veggies for the rice. Slightly pricey, but you get a lot of food and it's very consistent.

I was elated when I searched yelp for places to eat near my office and found Culvers. I ate there two days in a row last week, and ordered the follwing:  bacon butter burger, lettuce style - SO DISAPPOINTED. I had high expectations for a burger cooked in butter. While not terrible, this is not even comparable with in-n-out.  chicken fingers - Decent, although I've been spoiled by Shane's BBQ tenders which are made in house. I'm assuming Culver's came frozen in a big bag and then were deep fried. Still, pretty good for fast food.  green beans - Not cooked nearly enough for my liking, forced down several fork-fulls then threw the rest away.   Would only visit again if co-workers dragged me along. I'm sure I would have a different view of the place if I were in glutton mode chomping on the custard and french fries.

Almost as good as Fazoli's, only without free breadsticks and 5x the price. QUITE disappointing.

The best farmers market I've been to in the phoenix area. Locally produced olive oil, cheese, eggs, grass fed beef and all kinds of veggies have made it a staple of my Saturdays. Show up at 11 for the cooking demo, you'll thank me!

Pita Pit shits on all other franchise sub shops. I mainly eat salads not subs, and this is my favorite place to go for lunch in the area. The meat they use is high quality, and they grill it immediately before putting into a salad or pita. There are many toppings to choose from, and they are generous with portions. Here's what I usually get:  club (bacon, ham, turkey) spinach green pepper onion black olives pineapple  cucumber feta honey mustard  I love it. My coworkers and I go every Thursday because the lady who is working during lunch that day is very nice and makes the best pita/sald! Try this place out!

I have only been to MADCAP once, to see "Until the Light Takes Us" - a documentary about KVLT Norwegian Black Metal. I am very excited to have a theater playing REAL independent films and cult classics nearby. I frequently visited Chandler Cinemas to see films put on by Midnight Movie Mamacita - Cannibal Holocaust, El Topo, The Holy Mountain, Re-animator, Black Christmas.. etc. I was very disappointed to see that theater go. When I found out that she'd been relocated to continue the tradition at MADCAP, I rejoiced. I look forward to seeing many movies here in the future.

Great beer selection at affordable prices! New beers on tap every week. Nice atmosphere. Weird furry bartender on crutches is great for a laugh!

I have been looking forward to trying sals since they opened a few months ago - I live just a few blocks away.  Grabbed a slice today. It was really disappointing - crust was not fully cooked and there was not nearly enough cheese... several bites were just sauce and doughy crust. Bummer.

The chopped salad and pork belly pastrami blew my damn mind. Great staff, great food and reasonable prices make this my favorite spot in old town.

This is my favorite shop in Phoenix. It houses Eastside Records and many(10?) other vendors in the same vein as Crossroads in Portland. They've got tons of new/used records, tapes, audio gear, clothing and books. For the most part though, it is a record store with a great selection and good prices. I would say that the majority of the records are used, but they also have good new releases and reissues. The Punk, Jazz and Reggae sections are huge compared with anyone else in town. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and there's always new stuff in the new arrivals bin when I stop by.
