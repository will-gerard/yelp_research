In all fairness I live a block away, and that convenience does cloud my judgement.  However, C.J. (the owner) is a true gentleman, the food is pretty decent, the drinks are very cheaply priced (kiltlifter is always 3.25 a pint, a Jim Beam Manhattan is 4.00) and the regulars are a bunch of characters.  They strongly encourage regulars too, it is really a family place.

People really need to understand where they are going and the role the place is supposed to fulfill.  I find it funny that all three of the negative reviews mention how the food was great and the environment is chaos.  That is what they do at Harvey's.  Apparently everyone who went got Polly, who is ridiculously hilarious and a lot of fun, not on meth, not drunk, just really interesting from the chemicals produced inside her own head.  Personally, I prefer Monty, he is a sarcastic fifty-something Midwesterner who cooks one of the best burgers I have ever had (sorry, better than Polly), mixes a mean Manhattan, tells awesome stories and will simultaneously insult you, shake your hand and discount your drink.  When the bowling game is functional it promotes awesomely competitive tournaments and if you take over the jukebox the moment you arrive you create your own ambience.  Bring a friend, split the Super Wineburger with Cheese and an order of Chicken Fingers, leave happy.  Wash, Rinse, Repeat as desired. The only reason I would consider bumping it down a star is that I am normally a devout beer drinker and they only have Budweiser and something (I believe coors) light on draft.  Don't care, cheap cocktails and Midwestern bitterness save the day.

I have had excellent luck with this place by always following the same formula.  Order mid-week, get the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Lamb Kwarma, order both at least medium, preferably spicy.  Ask for an extra side of rice, I have always gotten it at no extra charge and the portion of entree does require more rice.  Always order Garlic Naan, probably two orders.  This method will easily feed six people, or yourself for a couple days. I can't comment on the complaints expressed by others, as I have never tried Flavors of India their way. My way, I have always been on the verge of food romance pants explosion.

To me, the Swizzle always feels like a Southern California beach bar.  Maybe it is the nautical theme, the bumper sticker collection or the year-round Christmas lights.  Either way, it makes me nostalgic for my visits to one of my best friends when he lived a little North of San Diego.  Drinks are cheap and strong, and they offer a nightly special.  Beer selection is pretty limited, but at least they have Fat Tire on draft.  Bartenders and customers alike are always friendly.  Trivia night has recently changed, I think it's on Wednesday but wouldn't swear to it.  They seem to do it potluck style, and if you are in the mood for a cheap meal and aren't afraid of crockpots, I suspect you could poach.  I do love the sliding door to nowhere/terrarium/glass dungeon mentioned in the other reviews.  Every bar should have a "what the hell" feature.

This does not exist.  It is now an unbelieveably soulless gay bar with the inventive name "Bar One".  That is all.

I will admit right up front, I have never eaten dinner at the Rokerij.  I have, however had happy hour there about a dozen times, and that experience deserves a consistent five stars. They have recently modified the specifics of happy hour for the better, currently it is $5 small plates, house wines and well drinks from 4-6 PM and 11- Close every night.  All of the small plates are top notch food.  I personally recommend the soft tacos with Adovada, Brie and Tenderloin Toasts, or Bacon Wrapped Scallops.  However, there are about 12 other options and all of the ones I have tried have been excellent. Steven is the regular bartender and is extremely courteous.  The music is also a highlight, it is played off an old mac laptop, and features a mix of classics and cutting edge indie rock.  I love the downtstairs bar, great atmosphere for what little winter Phoenix has to offer.

In part, my five stars go out as a thank you.  This is the first Thai place I found in the valley where I left consistently happy.  Not dazzled, but happy.  I never experienced the snags in service that other reviews have mentioned, and every dish I tried was at the very least fresh-tasting and pleasant.  I always run Green Curry and Pad Thai as my first visit inquisition, and Thai Lahna aced them both.  Their Pad Thai is still very much in contention for my favorite in Phoenix.  The Green Curry has a great flavor, but lacks the array of vegetables that set a few other places apart.  So far, after over a dozen visits,  I have been very pleased with every dish I have tried, specifically remembering the coconut milk soup, yellow curry and pineapple fried rice in addition to the previously mentioned staples.  In all honesty, I probably feel a little more 4-starry about Thai Lahna, but because it made me believe there could be good Thai food here, I add the fifth for now.  Plus I need it to be ahead of Thai Rama, which sucks.

I am not done with Thai Rama.  Enough people, even close friends whose judgment I normally trust, have had good experiences there.  After about a half dozen times, I have been universally disappointed.  Granted, I have only eaten in one time, maybe they just have take-out issues, but I don't believe that to be the problem.  The Pad Thai is bizarrely sweet, like almost some sort of off-brand honey BBQ.  That isn't exactly the flavor, but that is what it made me think of.  Everything else, both Green and Yellow curries, as well as assorted rice and vegetable dishes just tasted bland and like they were using second-tier produce.  Maybe I just need to pull the ideal dish from the other yelper favorites, but until then, Thai Rama is significantly sub-par in my book.

If you have any interest whatsoever in Phoenix having a soul, or identity, or reason to be allowed to exist...please go to Durant's and take notes.  This is one of the very last vestiges of old school cool left in town.  This is one of the last places you can envision a star of decades past coming in and getting blitzed and creating history.  If that wasn't enough, they also pour some of the best martinis and specialty/throwback cocktails in town.  The Sidecar is fantastic, and if you are a Manhattan fan (this one's for you Dad), look no further.  As far as the food, this is one of those places where you can spend as much or as little as you like and leave happy.  If you just want a relatively affordable night at the bar, order the Durant's Debris and a Shrimp Cocktail, eat the complimentary garlic bread and leave stuffed and ecstatic.  If you want the full dining experience, get pretty much any entree (delmonico and salmon come especially recommended) a side of crab mac and cheese and the strawberry shortcake for dessert.  The service will be impeccable, that part is certain, and you will feel like you have stepped into a time or place where displaying a degree of class counted for something.  I prefer to dress to respect the establishment, but they have no such code, go comfortably.

Over two years in Phoenix and my first dinner at Barrio still stands as my best meal since arrival.  Started with the house margarita, which was great.  Also have tried the Organic Margarita, and it is spectacular.  Decide how much you feel like spending and order accordingly, there is no wrong answer to this question.  Except maybe "No thanks".  I shared the Chiles en Nogada and the Pescado del Mar.  I can't pick a favorite, possibly due to the brain damage from the firestorm of joy transmitted from tongue to pleasure center.  Chiles en Nogada is a twist on the classic Chile Relleno, they start with a large fresh poblano pepper, stuff it with chicken, onions, garlic, pecans, apples, and I seem to recall pomegranate and angel dust, then top it with an absurdly tasty almond cream sauce.  Pescado del Mar is pan roasted halibut sort of stuffed/topped with crab, shrimp, lobster, and scallops, finished off with chorizo and another different, obnoxiously good cream sauce.  For dessert, absolutely get the churros.  Do remember the little cinnamon sticks that the word churro implies, but imagine them expertly prepared, stuffed with goats milk caramel and vanilla bean ice cream.  Service was friendly and efficient, the wait was long, but that was expected.  The Sunday brunch is also very much worth checking out, particularly for the seafood crepes.  My only disappointment from El Barrio so far was my own fault.  I didn't feel like waiting for a table and made the mistake of chosing Fish Tacos for a to-go order.  The shelf life on fish tacos is not long.  By the time I got home, we had a Captain Crunch enemy standoff going.  (Soggies...if you needed the clarification)

Here is how you eat at Tradiciones: Select group of people, preferably more than two. If all are drinking, order pitcher of margaritas, ideally fruit flavored.  Mango is an excellent choice.  Order appropriately sized Parillada (family platter) accordingly.  Platter for 2 comfortably feeds three or four.  Platter for 4 comfortably feeds six to eight.  The platters prompt you to pick three meats. I highly recommend the shrimp, pork and chicken.  Mexican sausage is also good, but not as universally crowd pleasing.  You will automatically get chips and two kinds of salsa (one green, one red) which in my opinion are quite good. With the platter you receive tortillas (I prefer flour(I also prefer parentheses, apparently))rice, beans, guacamole, nopalitos, grilled tomato, and grilled onions.  This is all served on a cast iron skillet of sorts, placed on top of a candle-based warmer. Embrace the fact that the mariachi band will come to your table and want to play a song and ideally solicit a couple bucks.  Know a mariachi song, request it and enjoy it.  You are essentially in Mexican Disneyland.  Eat until you are ready to bust.  To avoid an unfortunate food coma driving disaster, wander around the attached Ranch Market grocery store marvelling at the brightly colored pastries, tortilla conveyor belt and whole cow head in the butcher case. Revel in the fact that the two person platter is only $24.95, the four person platter $48.95, and fruit-flavored margaritas for four were $24, blow the savings on Mexican candy or a Spiderman pinata. Drive home, pass out with a giant smile on your face.      Sunday Brunch is also really good.  Incredible variety of food, including an omelette bar and chocolate fountain, last I checked all for $14.95.  I kind of blew the climax of this review with the brunch thing didn't I?

None of this is news.  If you want a dirt cheap meal that will make both your tongue and wallet sing, go to Pita Jungle.  I agree with previous reviewers, it is a stupid name.  Throwing that aside, this is on the short list of places I would agree to for any given meal.  By myself I tend to resort to  the Black Bean Burger, or one of the Wood-Fired Pizzas.  With the girl, our order of choice is the Hummus with Grilled Chicken, and the Fruit and Cheese Fantasia.  The latter order is a ridiculous amount of food at an unthinkably low price, which happens to be ludicrously tasty.  Pita Jungle is one of those few places where it is difficult to blow it, everything is good, healthy and affordable.

So far, my favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix.  I faced a lot of disappointments and mediocrity before I found Thai Lahna and crowned it my valley favorite, but while I have enjoyed consistently good Thai at Thai Lahna, I have never gotten that glorious rush from eating their food.  The first time I tried anything from Sala Thai, my girlfriend ordered me Green Curry to go after dining there with her mother.  When she requested it Thai Hot, the server politely giggled behind her hand.  That curry was the single spiciest thing I have ever eaten.  I am accustomed to spice, but the girl took one bite and promptly ate two slices of bread to cool her esophagus.  I don't know if the spice dispenser malfunctioned, or they felt like messing with us or what, but it was basically a little cardboard trapezoid of napalm.  Even then, the delicate, sweet, earthy, volcanic flavors of their green curry came through.  A week or so later I found an excuse to try a visit to Sala in person.  I am often crippled by extensive menus, I find myself agonizing over the whole concept of "But what if one of my all-time favorite dishes is on this menu, but I choose the wrong thing and never come back, and my life is .003% less satisfying...", and the Sala Thai menu features pictures that make everything look delicious.  Ultimately I chose to go with Spicy Eggplant, which is out of character for me, because in trying any new Thai restaurant, my two defaults to establish a barometer are Green Curry and Pad Thai.  If you get those right, I trust you to do everything else.  So my Spicy Eggplant hits the table...you know those moments when food looks so spectacular that you're almost embarassed to defile it by eating it?  That was the case here, and not because it used fancy technique or elaborate chef-driven painting with sauces, but because the produce was so fresh, and the balance of colors so gorgeous, it essentially became some sort of accidental, outsider pop art.   Or something.  The important part is that it was exquisitely delicious.  The eggplant's texture was silky as it should be, the balance of sweet, savory, earthy and spicy was perfect, the rice was the proper consistency..it was what I want Thai food to be.  I have not been to Thailand, I have no close friends or relatives of Thai descent, I haven't read an encyclopedia of Thai cooking.  I only know that my mouth and belly left pleased as they have been by no other Thai place in town, and that is good enough for me.

Skip all the -berto's, skip Juan's, if you are looking for a consistently delicious Mexican taco/burrito shop, go to Regio's.  When I first moved here two years ago it was called Antonio's, somewhere along the line they changed the name to Regio's and I was afraid my delicious secret was gone, but the menu remained unchanged.  LIke the others, the food is so cheap I periodically try to run the numbers to see how they could possibly be profitable (to reassure myself it is not a drug front), and while I haven't cracked that equation, I also don't equate them with crack.  See what I did there?   Standing favorites are: all of the breakfast burritos, Shrimp Burrito or Tacos, Carnitas or Adobada Burrito, and Ceviche Tostada.  My only real word of advice is if you order a standard meat burrito, tell them to go easy meat and load you up on the salsa, guacamole and diced onions and cilantro.  My first few burritos were so thickly stuffed with meat...(insert inappropriate meat-stuffing joke here).  The only things really preventing Regio's from five-star status are that they are not 24 hours, and I have an unconfirmed suspicion that one visit may have given me food poisoning.  I am still searching for the real killers.

The only thing that would improve this taco trailer would be a concrete definition of the hours at which I can patronize them.  Patronize is of course intended to signify a giving of business, not a stating of "Oh, hey there champ, it's ok, you can do better next time."  Essentially, they offer chicken and carne asada, with three basic preparations: Tacos for $1 a piece, burritos for $5, and Quesadillas for $7.  There is also a burger and a hot dog,  but come on, is that why you are here? If you order one of the meats, it comes off the grill, and you get to watch them chop it up with a crazy knife, on what appears to be a well-worn tree stump.  You definitely want to order "with everything"  and an horchata to drink is also the course of wisdom.  Final note: the people watching is amazing, in addition to the almost cartoonishly cowboy-looking dudes, I had a random guy who parked in the front wearing an FBI (Federal Boobie Inspector) shirt and raced off as soon as possible when his food was ready.  Wouldn't want anyone thinking your love of the Charlie's taco made you...sexually ambiguous?

I mostly concur with the positive reviews, i just feel compelled to battle the nimrods who haven't gotten it.  I have eaten here more than a half dozen times.  Not a single disappointment.  The pork torta?  Three consecutive times, all fantastic.  Naco torta, satisfying and delicious.  Side vegetables?  Fresh and well cooked.  You could choose to find fault with the layout of the place or the casualness of service.  I choose to do neither of those things, as I am not a difficult Wang-slave.  Eat and enjoy the food, that is the only relevant thing here.

Normally, I go to a new place at least three times before writing a review.  Parlor has earned a quick review by handling larger crowds than expected, pretty much from the very beginning.  I have tried the Caprese salad (twice), Funghi, Margherita, and Smokey pizzas.   Nothing has blown my mind, but absolutely everything has been better than acceptable, one might even say "very good."  Sure, this is not Bianco's wood-fired pizza, but you can get in, eat, pay, leave, get hungry and eat again at parlor, faster than you can get a pizza at Bianco.  They also feature a happy hour in the bar, and I have heard rumors of a late-night menu.  And I almost forgot, beautiful space: faithfully preserved inside, lovely patio with fresh herbs planted and a general airy hipness righteous enough to go around.

I held off, I wanted to be judicious, but my satisfaction is so thorough, it knows no bounds.  This is a restaurant that is exactly what it is trying to be.  Everytime I have gone, my expectations have been exceeded.  I have tried most of the pizzas, all have been excellent.  I have sampled salads, burgers, sandwiches, everything A-OK.  Beer, wine and liquor prices are beyond reasonable,  Basically, this is the neighborhood restaurant you have been waiting for, the place where everything is affordable and delicious, and the menu is diverse and balanced enough to keep you coming back a couple times a week.  Thank you Parlor, I love you deeply, and sincerely.

Maybe it is ridiculous, but to me Chipotle is another example of people completely missing the point.  You can not consistently get a better meal for under $7.  In my life I have probably eaten at Chipotle a little over 100 times at locations across four states.  Consistently, the ingredients are fresh, the service is friendly and the price is almost unfathomably fair.  If you think Chipotle is only burritos, you are missing the point.  If they are not busy, order soft tacos.  You get three, ask for three different meats.  Mix it up, all four are delicious, while I do tend to favor their free-range carnitas and the chicken.  Move on to salsas, get at least two, I prefer the fresh tomato (aka pico de gallo) and the medium corn (aka elote). You have hereby made your meal healthy and vegetable heavy.  Especially when you finish with freshly shredded romaine lettuce.  Also justify the cheese and super fresh mexican sour cream as fulfillment of calcium rations.  If you really need to cut carbs or some lame-o thing like this, get a salad or a burrito bowl with black beans.  If you want to turn your order into two meals, stick with the burrito and load it up, or get the burrito bowl, vegetarian, load up the salsa, black beans and guacamole and add on a side of chips for .95.  Now start planning your Halloween free burrito costume.
