I used to go to Richardson's religiously before the great fire of July/2009. Thanks to the tragic loss of my original introduction to the holy trinity, I slid into The Rokerij one evening in search of my "last supper appetizer" THE Garlic Plate.    Favorite dish in the valley, hands down.    The hole downstairs makeshifts for a great date night venue, in thanks to the lack of cellular service. You can keep your partner's attention solely on you for the duration of your meal/bottle of wine/conversation...   I always fail to remember the after effects of said Garlic Plate. Your body will betray you, your stomach will take over and your boyfriend will be disgusted by you sleeping ever so close...  I highly suggest at least a 12 hour separation from all loved ones if you plan on them wanting to hug you ever again...   This meal is well worth the awkward night following, in fact I think I want some again tomorrow...

Bruchetta board, pitcher of Kronenbourg, sitting on the patio, stellar service and boyfriend = death because this is the best dining experience I might ever have.   Favorite slab consists of: Roasted Red Peppers on Goat Cheese, Warm Artichoke, Dates, Pistachios with Ricotta and Sheeps Milk below a sweet Tomato Jam.    The only *bad* (more so just personally annoying), thing I've ever come across here, had nothing to do with the food itself or even the servers..well not our server..was when one of the ladies walking around clearing tables felt the need to express to us that SHE has OCD therefore, we needed to remove the last 2 pieces of bruchetta from the board, so she could clear it..because it was making HER uncomfortable..   Never push your 'disorder' off onto someone else and expect them to abide, especially when your customers are deep in mid-conversation about serious things like puppies and the night's baking agenda...this customer will not yield and out of spite, leave a lingering, lonesome bruchetta upon the slab for your sake.   I, too, have a disorder - not caring about your fear of individual bread pieces on a plate.   Despite said occurrence, there are NO complaints, ever. A valley staple that I recommend highly, for all occasions.

I crave the il purista from Defalco's at least once a week. It's such a simple sandwich, but it's the best -and closest to a NY deli-, I'm going to get in Scottsdale..    I prefer dining in. There's patio seating, a TV usually with a good game on and good music - Pinback, The Shins, Fleet Foxes?! (Although I was iffy about staying last time to enjoy my meal, due to the fact that Morrissey was playing.. but I'm pretty sure it was a huge mistake/defect and it won't happen again)   The staff here reminds me of the neighborhood deli's back East: until they know you, they don't care what you order, what you think and who you are..but when they start recognizing you, you feel like part of a secret family.   It may be a bit of a wait, but it's well worth it. I prefer quality of food and quality of staff, as opposed to how fast I can choke it down on my lunch break.    Savor it.

I'm still feeling my regrets for coming into this place. What a joke.    My mom and I have this thing about Mexican food/tex-mex restaurants in the valley-we've eaten at most all of them. When we go out for lunch, we generally look for a new one to try in the area we plan on being in around that time. Unfortunately, this is the place we stumbled upon.    Our server seemed already "put off" by us for some reason..I'm blaming it on the fact that I was wearing something with a pattern so he automatically knew I must be one of those "artistic" types who like real food and not some shitty Mexican version of Fuddruckers. We were doomed from the start.     I'll save you the details just because even I'M annoyed by how annoyed I was with every interaction with my server. After looking over the menu, I decided that I wasn't that into anything and just wanted a burrito.   Word for word:   Me - Can I get a burrito, beans, rice and sour cream only.     Oh and can you grill it, or put it on your flat top?   Douche - WELL YEA THAT'S HOW THEY DO IT,....pFFFTttt, HOW ELSE DO YOU MAKE A BURRITO. WE ALWAYS MAKE THEM LIKE THAT   .... ...  ...   Me - Oh. I usually have to ask. Okaaay.   - Server puts in the order then comes back.   Douche - SO DO YOU WANT THAT ON THE FLAT TOP BECAUSE IT'LL FALL THROUGH ON THE GRILL.   Me - Yea that's fine.   Douche - LIKE TACO BELL   Me - Ok.   ...   inner monologue Me - LISTEN DICK, YOUR MENU ISN'T APPETIZING SO JUST GIVE ME A FUCKING TORTILLA  A BEAN AND SOME TOMATO SO I CAN HAVE A MEAL WITH MY MOM THAT DOESN'T REVOLVE AROUND YOU BEING AN ASSHOLE.   ehem..   Food came and I ate about a third of it before noticing little chunks of bacon in my burrito. THANK GOD I'm not a real vegetarian even though I say I am, I eat seafood and will try meat when I feel the quality of meat is on par with excellence at restaurants worthy of my money..    I also got the pleasure of witnessing about 11 plates of food up on the line for about 5 minutes, just sitting there while the servers folded silverware into napkins and talked about Carlos Mencia...or something equally as boring.   Needless to say, I reluctantly left a tip.      I walked away immediately feeling nauseous and thoroughly grossed out by the whole experience - now 24 hours later - I have a headache that won't go away, what feels like the stomach flu and an intense feeling that I can never enjoy a burrito again.    ..I hope the lack of interest in burrito's is a phase, Blanco, for your sake.   I'll never betray you again, Taco's Jalisco's.

As a picky-pesca-tarian, I was initially nervous about eating at Nobuo for fear of ordering like an asshole. Surprisingly, I was interested in numerous dishes and completely satisfied with each one and continue to up the ante on my coming of age eating habits..    The teeter tots, i could eat by the truck load, as well as the pickled watermelon radish. - Still craving these two bites.  The seabass and mushrooms were my favorite.  I had a bite or two of: the pork belly buns- soft shell crab sandwich- the okonomiyaki..all wonderful flavors, but by this point I was filling up.   To finish we split the orange fritters and throughout I had a couple Devil's Haircut cocktails...hands down, my new favorite valley cocktail.   It's always a pleasure to go to Nobuo, Sit at the bar if it's available so you can watch/chat with the magic man at work.

I can see both sides of the argument.     Downtown needs to appeal to both parties...both parties being the downtown dwellers and the commuters. The DD's want all independent coffee shops, bakeries, markets, boutiques, restaurants. The Big C's (suburbanites) need to be drawn in by familiarity (i.e. CVS, UO, Star$).    I have yet to make a definite decision about cityscape being good or evil, except for the fact that at least Phoenix is putting it's focus on downtown aside from JUST First Friday's to appeal to the people who don't come down here.    Now if a Chili's goes in, I'm moving again, but for now I think there should be no argument of CS being "good or evil", but rather a CHANGE, which is really the direction we all should be happy about.   In other news: An ice rink?     ...really?!
