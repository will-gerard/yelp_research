Not only does this place get it's ingredients directly from Italy, it makes a variety of flavors fresh, daily!   I got my first taste of gelato when I visited Rome Italy a few years back. I've tried other gelato spots around the U.S, but nothing has caught my AMORE, or the authentic Italian flavor, more than Angel Sweet.   So far my favorite combo is the "most popular" Panna Cotta with Banana, (which an employee recommended), Hazelnut and Pistachio, as well as SUPER Dark Chocolate again, with the Panna Cotta.  Don't forget your punch card, buy 12, and get one kid's size free!

I determine whether I like a Mexican restaurant based on two things, the kind of Mexican beer on draft and, chile rellenos.  By far my favorite Chile Relleno dish I've had. This place is great.  I love the variety of choices I get to dip my chips in! Even the beans and rice are good!!! Just say Si.

It was a beer, pizza kind - of - a- night. And a mighty fine one at that! First time trying the place out... heard about it via a junk mail insert advertisement, decided to give it a go. Called in an order for pick-up. Ready in 15 minutes. Perfect. Tried the BBQ chicken and added pineapple pizza, yes I know it sounds weird, but quite tasty.   The best part of the experience? Why seeing the YELP sticker in the window of course! Hoorah!

Tried this place after my Papa raved about it. The food is excellent, as is the staff. My Papa was a loyal customer and loved this place. Even though it's not on my side of town, I will continue to support this place in his honor. Thank you for being so wonderful and taking extra special care of my Grandpa. =)

DISLIKE.  Normally I fly southwest - for some odd reason US airways this past time was the better deal. NEVER AGAIN!  I like to consider myself not much of a complainer (see other reviews) but my flight out of PHX to LAS VEGAS was horrendous.  Allow me to clarify. Not the flight itself but the plane. I might as well have been on a private jet. I think if I stretched my body from fingertips to toes I would make up the width of the plane... I'm 5'1.... Another down side was that they charge for checked baggage - needless to say I was not going to pay the extra fee and thus consolidated all my belongings into a small 'approved' suitcase, only to come to find out that it wouldn't fit in the overhead storage. Again - terrible. Again - reference to the size.

If you consider yourself familiar with the Tukee area... than you KNOW about the Original Burrito Co. Mainly I tend to go in the morning for one of their delicious breakfast burritos! Along with the burrito you get a small bag of chips and salsa... for breakfast you ask?! You betcha!! mmm mmm mmm. It does, tend to get pretty busy, so sometimes I call in an order ahead of time and pick it up to carry out.   In response to Abe S's previous review, they are indeed moving to the formally occupied KFC. Mr. Delacruz, the owner seems to view this as an opportunity to expand and perhaps open a drive thru! YAY! I'm all for the drive thru expansion! Apparently "spring" is when all the major changes are happening...   Don't forget your student ID, 10% off!

The great Gabi M. introduced this place to me for the first time not quite a year ago. (THANK YOU)  Of course, before our meeting, I checked out what other yelpers had to say and tried the iced chai with boba. DE-LIC-IOUS! Starbucks ain't got nothin' on this place! Now my roommate and I find ourselves trying to come up with reasons to drive to Tempe Market Place. Who are we kiddin.... we come for the tea! =) When are you expanding slash opening new locations?!

If I were to sum this place up...  I'd say: Inexpensive & Tasty.  Service is eh. Sushi is good for the price. I come here frequently.  Introduced quite the number of friends who are in town visiting- all love this place, and mostly rave about, "how fun it is." I suppose there is something fun about watching your food travel on the revolving bar!  A drawback however is having to wait for a particular roll because everyone sitting ahead of you in the rotation got first dibs and grabbed em' all up! For example, the Vegas rolls. (am I right?!) =) 9 out of 10 times I've been seated immediately. For the most part I'd say they're generally pretty efficient about that.  It's fantastic to get your bill, only to realize after all that sushi, you've spent less than $10!

Ok Teharu..... it took nearly 40 minutes to be seated. Had we been called as our name appeared on the sign up sheet, it would have only been about a 20 minute wait.  You can't have a guy that speaks little english in charge of seating people if he is going to skip them/ and or give away the table to another party.  This was not an impressive visit. Better luck next time.

I dub this place my favorite breakfast restaurant in the valley, though I don't get over there as often as I'd like. If I could eat breakfast here everyday.... I WOULD! I can't get enough of the protein cakes - bring. it. on! The eggs are good. The potatoes are great.   THE END.

Guess what?! They're moving! A few miles away from their current Chandler location to Tempe, on the Northeast corner of McClintock and Warner.    My family has been going to "Rigs" (as we like to refer to it) for years. We love the bread, dipped in the olive oil and special seasoning- we also like to add parmesan cheese, mmmm.  I've never tasted a better chicken piccata topped with a lemon, capers, and tasty sauce. Catch this lunch special on Friday for $6.95.   Friendly, efficient service and a great soundtrack to put you in the appropriate Italian mood.

Still as fantastic as ever!  Great new location. To quote yelp's rating system... "Whoohoo! As good as it gets!"

So excited that they opened one at this location! Any business in this building never stays very long - but I'm hoping Oregano's is here to stay!  If it's anything like it's fellow locations - it will always be poppin'!  Thanks for the yummy food, excellent soundtrack and atmosphere as always!
