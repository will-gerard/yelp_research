Not up to LA Fitness standards, or worth your money. I only go here because I live within walking  distance, and I usually regret it.  The facility is old, machines are old, and half the time it's dirty.  And tonight I noticed ants crawling all over the locker room.    Do yourself a favor, drive to one of the two on camelback.

Mark at Flyer's Direct has been the primary Printer for AIDS Walk Phoenix and Aunt Rita's Foundation for the last 2 years.  He produces quality materials, with prompt turnaround times, with every single project.  Mark also goes above and beyond with all of his work, and sometimes even volunteers to deliver printed materials.  His prices are always very competitive, and he delivers very professional product at a price that's within a non-profits budget.  Recently, an employee at our organization forgot to print something that was neccessary for an event.  We contacted Mark the day before the event and he was able to deliver exactly what we needed less than 24 hours later, delivering to our office on a Saturday.  He came through for us in a huge way and went far above and beyond what I would ever expect from a printer.  He was a lifesaver.  We utilize them for almost 100% of our printing, and recommend them on a regular basis.  I would not take our printing to anyone else in town, and encourage everyone reading this to call Flyer's Direct and ask for Mark.
