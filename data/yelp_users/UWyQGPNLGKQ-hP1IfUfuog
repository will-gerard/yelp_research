Waste of time. You need an appointment for an oil change. The lady was rude about it, and said the earliest she could schedule me was next week...for an oil change. I went across the street to Jiffy Lube and they got me right in.

Like all GNC, a great place to get vitamins, weight loss products, and muscle gaining products.  This is a smaller location but looks to have everything needed. This visit I only need to eat candles and they are the only company that seems to have them. BTW, great product to help with sinus problems.  I just moved to the area and like to candle my ears when I travel a lot. The man working there was very quick to help me when I walked in.  He took me right to the product and showed me the best deal to get. I will be back.

Wow....I'm so glad I found this place and Andy on Yelp!!!   So, I my car worked on at two fifteen shops in Texas. I had all new speakers installed. The sounds wasn't very good and I started hearing rattling after a month. I dropped my car off with Andy. I left it all up to him to get it looking and sounding great. He recommend new tires and rims. He had the perfect wheels in mind.  Flat black. They look amazing. Once Andy and his team opened up the bag of worms of the speakers, the were floored with how bad the other shops had done on the installs. Wires everywhere and in places they shouldn't be. Andy said the kicker speakers the other shop used weren't very good. He recommended to pull all of it and do it right. So, I said lets do it. I didn't want to put a bandaid over the problem. I wanted it done right.  Instead of front and back speakers, he recommended an entire JL system. Front speakers, and one 10 inch sub with custom box.  Took them a few days because there was so much redo. Let me tell you, this car sounds amazing now!  Crystal clear highs, excellent midrange and the sub fills in very nice. They even installed a bass knob, so I can have more bass if a song is lacking or another song has too much. They also did the tint and it looks great.   It's a shame there are so many hacks installing speakers and working on cars. Rest assured Andy and his team are amazing at what they do. I will be back very soon to get more work done.

Stopped in to get a quick slushy. Only two cars were there.  I hit the button and waited. After a few minutes no one answered so I pushed the button again.  Waited a few more minutes and still nothing. After about 10 minutes of waiting and seeing a girl take food to another car I hit the button over and over until someone answered. Finally...I placed my order and paid at the screen.  The slush came out quickly but it should never take over ten minutes at a fast food place when no one is there. I think I'll find a different location next time.

Very friendly and helpful location.  Greeted when I walked in. Came in for a light bulb and the associate was very helpful and knowledgeable about the specialty light bulb I had. She located my replacement and showed me some other better energy saving options. Check out was quick.  I also needed a propane tank and the cashier rung it. Thought it was a little expensive at $49 but refills are only $14 (I had to leave my two in Texas because the movers wouldn't move them). Another associate immediately walked out with me and got the propane tank for me. I will definitely come back to this location.

I've been to many different OTB's...This was the best customer service I've had at one.  The hostess was very friendly when we walked in. We went to the bar and Tia one of the  bartenders helped us. She was really friendly, fast, attentive and made good drinks.  The food was as good as the other OTB's I've been to. I love the happy hour specials. The food specials are smaller sizes starting at $3. The fajitas were tasty and came with a ton of meat.  When we were getting ready to leave the manager with the cool mustache came by to thank us for coming in, and gave us a bag of coupons to come back again. We will  be back soon!  Tip: The best time to go is Happy Hour.  One of the better ones around.  They have two different times, 3PM - 7PM Mon- Fri and again 9PM - 11PM Sun - Thur.  During Happy Hour you can get a lot of different drinks for discounted price.  I like the discounted appetizers you can get at the bar during happy hour.  You get a cheaper and smaller size which is nice since most of the appetizers are too much food anyway.  I love the stuffed jalapenos, empanadas, corn quesadilla, beef mini tacos, flautas, mini chimichangas and the cantina nacho's.

I have been using the service for almost 3 months. When I first moved in I found Lucas Lawn service's card in the irrigation systems timer. On the back of the card it had the zones written out for the system. I assumed they must be the ones that have taken care of the yard before, so I would give them a try. When I called in I spoke to Tammi and she confirmed they use to service the house. She said the owner Ryan would give me a call. He called me later that day. He said the house use to be serviced and he didn't need to come out and see the yard. He would just give me the price the old house owners had. It was $60 bi-weekly and that included mowing the back yard, weeding the yard and flower beds, and rotating the trimming of the front and back yard flower beds. I agreed to it and they started. A few weeks in I saw there were weeds coming in and I called Ryan about it. I told it was grassy weeds. He said there was a chemical for grassy weeds and his lead was the only one that could apply it because it was expensive. He sent his supervisor out the next day to look at the yard. His supervisor agreed it was grassy weeds and he would take care of it on the next visit. A few weeks went by and the weeds just got worse. On June 1st I responded to an email from Tammi letting her know I was not happy with all the weeds in the yard. She asked me to send pictures, which I did. She said it would be taken care of. By June 30th, I was beyond frustrated. The yard is not very big, and half of it is now weeds. I let them know to cancel my service because they did not take care of the weeds, nor was the yard showing any sign of getting better. I get an email back from Ryan saying it was the first he had heard that I had a weed problem and wanted to send his new supervisor out. I told him I wasn't waiting another month, while paying to see results. He came back with another email with a threat of my contract and technically I needed to give 30 days notice. Whatever, I let him know I didn't appreciate that since he didn't hold up his end of the contract. I finally just called him to get to the bottom of it. He was polite but acted like we had never talked. It was the first time he had heard of the grassy weed problem and he didn't think they serviced the house before I started. Really!! He agreed they dropped the ball on communication, but said there wasn't much they could do with grassy weeds. Why didn't you tell me that 2 months ago Ryan??? Why was today the first I heard of that and that you charge extra for that kind of weed control. Anyway, they aren't a terrible service if you just want mowing and trimming (but there are others just as good and cheaper) but I can NOT recommend them for customer service, lawn and especially not weed control.

A pretty good Buffalo Wild Wings location.  They have the baseball package which is great to see multiple games at once.  They have two huge screens over the bar.  I usually get the Rangers game on one of them.  The bar staff is great, especially Bryan.  He does a great job making sure my order is always right and I never go long without a beer.  Food is as good as any other Buffalo Wild Wings.  Lots of sauces to choice from and you can get boneless or traditional.  Best time to go is Tuesdays for traditional and Thursdays for boneless.  You can get a minimum of 4 wings and they are discounted.  I think they are $.60 each.  During happy hour you can also get discounted appetizers like chips and queso.  I knocked a star off because they don't show the UFC fights like other Buffalo Wild Wings.  I have to drive to Scottsdale, while this location is minutes from my house.  Besides that, this is my go to place during the week for happy hour.  Good service, lots of TV's for sports, good happy hour and discounts, and in a good location.

My wife and I stopped in after receiving a text for a discount.  We love yogurt, and were excited to give it a try.  I was very impressed with this location.  Very clean when you walk in, tons of yogurt flavors and the biggest toppings bar I've seen.  The prices were on par with other yogurt places we have been to.  The topping bar was full, fresh and clean....Impressive!  The young lady that checkout us out was very friendly, and we check out quickly.  We will definitely be back!

My wife and I have been looking for a some good Mexican/TexMex food since we moved to Phoenix. Finally found a good place!!  The shopping area this place is in is very nice.  Valet parking for $7 which I found to be reasonable. The hostesses were very friendly when we walked up and welcomed us. We were seated right away. The waiter was amazing the whole time.  He first showed us the happy hour menu and the good deals they had during Happy Hour. I went with the house margarita on the rocks and my wife had the mixed berry margarita on the rocks for $5 each.  I really liked the house margarita because they use fresh lime juice and no mixes. My wife loved her margarita. We also tried the dip plate for $3 during Happy Hour. It was beans, guacamole and queso. It was a nice starter.  Not the best queso I've had but better than all the other places I've tried so far in Phoenix. We didn't know and I guess the waiter wasn't paying attention to the time. Happy hour had already ended when we ordered. He said it was his fault and those drinks and appetizer were for the happy hour price.  That was very nice of him. I went on to order the Carna Asada burrito with jalapeños and my wife got three street tacos, Carnitas, bbq Pork and chipotle shrimp. Her favorite was the chipotle shrimp. She subbed rice for street corn and thought it was good too. I got the black beens and rice.  Loved the rice. The beans were ok. They didn't skimp on the jalapeños. My burrito was loaded with jalapeños and steak. Tasted great and spicy! I also tried the jalapeño infused tequila margarita.  One of the  Best spicy margarita I've had. For being upscale the prices were responsible. Our total was $85 for 3 rounds of margaritas, the app and our dinners. The bathrooms are down stairs. The do have an elevator if needed. The bathroom was modern and very clean. We will be back for sure. I highly recommend.

My wife gets her nails done here and loves this place! She does the SNS style (dip powder) and they last really well! She's been several times now and the customer service is always great! She had one time when they chipped and they replaced the set at no cost! They even last up to 3 weeks! Her nature nails are stronger and longer than they ever have been! Sometimes there's a long wait, but that's just because they're busy, call ahead if you don't want to wait, they're very flexible on making appointments! Julie is the BEST for pedicures, she gives an awesome massage! We'll be back!

Stopped in to try out the sushi before heading to a concert.   The restaurant was very dark when you walk in.   I had to use the rest room.  It was down a dark hall, and I couldn't find it without turning the flash light on my phone on.  Service was very slow. Took about 10 min to get waitress to come talk to us.  The place only had two other tables with customers.  The menu was hard to read and didn't have descriptions. The more I read the menu the more the place just seemed weird.  It was a mix of Mexican sushi.    The waitress didn't know anything about the menu when I asked her.  I ordered the egg rolls and they were ok.  The sauce it came from was just chili paste out of a jar.  The fried rice was the biggest portion size I've seen.  It wasn't very good.  It was very buttery tasting, lacked any vegetables, and wasn't fried.   I then ordered a couple of easy rolls you can get anywhere since I didn't have descriptions of the other rolls and the waitress couldn't tell me what was in them.  One was a California roll, the other was a Philly roll. The presentation was good when they were delivered, but they were the worst I've ever had.  Tasted like old fish and had a smell. The rice on the rolls had a weird texture to them.  I ate one piece each and that's all I could stomach. I just asked for the check.  The waitress didn't seem to care to ask why we hardly ate any of the food.   I won't be back and can't recommend it.

Decided to stop in based on the high reviews on Yelp.  I guess I should have read the negative ones, because they were spot on.  We walked in and it was pretty busy. First off, you can't tell if you wait to be seated, so we should stood at the door for a few minutes.  Then we walked over to a table and a lady (I guess she worked there) said to sit anywhere. So, we picked a table and waited.  10 minutes passed and no one came to talk to us.  We gave up and left.  We won't be back, it didn't look that special,  and the service was nonexistent.

My wife and I just stopped in for lunch. Pretty good crowd around 11:30 AM. They have six self ordering stations. Just walk up to the kiosk and it's touchscreen and place your order. The kiosk doesn't  except Apple Pay but the check out in the front does.  For lunch I like going with the pick two. You pick two of a a half salad, half soup, half sandwich, or a flatbread.  I ordered the Caesar chicken salad and the chicken ham and Swiss flatbread. I also like on the kiosk where you can customize and add or take off ingredients from your order. We sat outside on this nice day, and waited about five minutes for order to come. The lady brought our food and she was real nice and asked if we needed anything. She even went to refill my water for me. The food was excellent.  Not sure why all the negative reviews but I'll definitely be back.

Just moved to area and was excited to see there was an AMC with a Prime Dolby theater close to me. Prime theaters have more speakers and a bigger screen. It also has seats that pulsate with the action in movies. It really makes you feel the movie. I think the sound and screen is better than IMAX. This theater was as good if not better than the one in Dallas. Saw the new Capitan America and it was a great move and experience. I always buy my seats in advance to get the seats I want. I wouldn't recommend just showing up to see a new release. I bought my tickets for Sat afternoon on Wed. If you go to the first showing of the day it's also a lot cheaper to experience Prime.  I did not try the concessions this time so I can't comment on that. I did notice that there were less self kiosks then the AMC's in Texas. It wasn't a problem this time, but it could be if a lot of people were there at the same time. I will be back...very soon.
