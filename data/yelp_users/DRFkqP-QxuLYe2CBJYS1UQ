Ever since the remodel, there is hardly a wait except Sundays. Delicious juicy chicken, cheesy mac, and tea so sweet it'll give you diabetes! Yumm

My pizza was a half-burned grease bucket. Gross, I highly doubt they gave Oprah what they gave me!

Yummy Mediterranean fusion spot! Super nice servers and food is consistent, which is saying a lot.

You know, Ive come to Urban Beans many times in the past and it was great. Send my hubby to grab food today and wow! What a disappointment. I had an egg sandwich which the egg was overly peppered and grey. Gross, which is too bad because the english muffin was really good. The fruit salad was also gross, the strawberries were brownish and transparent and the cantaloupe was mushy and mealy too. Also had a yogurt parfait with granola and there was 2 tablespoons max of yogurt and the rest of the cup was granola! Its supposed to be the other way around. Disappointing because I wanted to support a local business, but I cant wait for the Starbucks to open now!

Hands down my favorite mexican place of all time! Big cheesy chimis, huge burritos and tacos with the tastiest mexican fillings. My favorite is the Mayan Cochinita Pibil, so good Johnny Depp would've shot him dead in Once Upon a Time in Mexico! haha Seriously so good, plus they give you chips with endless salsa! My secret is to mix the spicy green salsa with the creamy cilantro! I love this restaurant so much I would marry it! lol

So disappointed since it's in my neighborhood. Interesting format but sloppy and disorganized assembly line. All the meats were super spicy, which paired with salsa, was way too hot. The tortilla soup remnants we had had NO TORTILLA, if there's no tortilla, its not tortilla soup! /end. The cookies were the highlight of the meal.  Now, they also have HORRENDOUS customer service! First off, no ice. I am so irritated that I will not come back again and will tell anyone who will listen how rude the blond cashier was. My sister had accidentally spilled our soup all over her hands and on the floor. No big deal, but not a single napkin in sight. When we asked for some, she returned with a wad of brown paper towels and then completely ignored us. Not a single staff member offered to replace our spilled soups or came to clean it up, just kept moving along as if they expected us to clean up the soup ourselves. I hate to think that it was a race thing, but their behavior was completely suspect. The manager came up to her to ask what happened, nodded, then returned to the assembly line. When I asked for a drink, she said there's no ice. But when she rung up this lovely young white couple, she said that they were making more and would bring it to them. WTF, I guess they don't want us black folks eating there.  P.S. This place doesn't hold a candle next to Barrio Cafe or Richardson's, what a joke.
