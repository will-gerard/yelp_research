One phenomenal restaurant! Certainly our family's favourite, so much so we still travel about forty minutes to eat here. Amazing service and good food. Would suggest to anyone! THE MARGARITAS ARE AWESOME. Family owned..

We travel all the way across the valley so that our pets get the best care possible. The best part is they do not pad the bill with services that are not needed.

I think my bike is working better than when I bought it [8] years ago. I took my Specialized HardRock in for a tuneup and it was done in just a few days and looks great too. Thanks John, GREAT job.

We stopped in for lunch on our 20th Anniversary. I have to admit we were starving to. Luckily it was Wednesday and the wine bottes were1/2 off. Our waiter was awesome. We split the calamari which was perfect meaty and tender with a nice coating. The Sorrentino was huge. Everythimg went well with the twisted red zin our waiter picked out. Stop by and ask for Mike. You will be glad you did. Casual dining but real good food.

I guess we caught this place on a bad night. It was 15 minutes after we were seated before our waiter came by. Once he got the drink & app order it was another 10 +. I ended up going to the bar to get our drinks, I could see them just sitting there in the service station. Finally someone brought our apps out, which were good, but no waiter. After a total of 45 minutes I asked the manager to just get us our check. She did and made no attempt to save the meal. Not planning on going back. Since there were plenty of empty tables it should not have been that slow.

When they show the cleaning crews are often friendly. Some are not and stomp around complaining. Or shower door has been broken twice as has some other small items. We never know when they are going to show either. Last week it was 10am. This time it is 3pm and no one is here yet. We called to cancel this visit because we have an appointment to be at by 4pm. The manager was rude and said that they will charge us 1/2 the cost of the cleaning job if we don't stay here and wait for them to clean. We have been waiting and no one ever showed. I called back to see where they were and was told that the manager canceled our service. The reason we scheduled a cleaning service is so we can schedule our other responsibilities.   It took all of a day to find a better mare reliable service for less. Don't waste your time with these guys. They have been going downhill for the past year. Never do all that they are supposed too.
