This company is a huge rip off.  They shoot photos at cirque du solei.  Their photographer told me that they off a discount if you purchase multiple photos.  That was certainly great!  What he failed to mention was that the discount was for 8 photos.  He only took 4.  I reached out to their "stellar" online support team because I did not think it was fair to pay the same price for half the photos.  They were rude and closed the chat without offering even a small compromise.  Do not do business with this company.

For the first time in my life I needed a Tailor to alter some clothes.  This family business is extremely friendly and professional.  I would recommend them for any clothing alterations or other tailor services.

It was 6:30pm or so on a Thursday night, the sign clearly said the place was open at 4:00.  My friends and I walk in and there is no customers nor is there any staff.  We nervously stand around for around 10 minutes or so.  A gentleman comes out and I say hello with hope in my eyes hoping for service.  He says hi back, walks into the back and then we wait a few minutes and nothing.  It was the first time I ever felt horribly awkward going to a restaurant in my life.  Considering I didn't even get served I would give zero stars if possible.
