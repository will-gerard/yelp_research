This was the first time I've ever ordered from this place and I'm wishing I had just ordered from somewhere else. My order was only an oven baked Sandwich and a 2-liter of Sierra Mist. About ten minutes later after I placed my order, I get a phone call saying they're out of Sierra Mist, which is no biggie. Then I was told my order would be about 30-40 minutes which I was fine with. My order doesn't get delivered to me after more than an hour and the delivery driver even asked for a tip. I still tipped the guy (mostly because I'm also in the service industry) and was just relieved I finally got something to eat. As soon as I pull my sandwich out, it's almost no longer warm. I should have just ordered from Dominos that way I could have at least gotten a sandwich that has its cheese still melted. Never ordering from here again.
