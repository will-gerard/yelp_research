Used to come here all the time and never had bad service until today. The hostess was less than friendly and so was our server. I took my sister there for her birthday and we were disappointed in the way our sever didn't pay attention to us or do anything for her birthday. My roll was also cut awkwardly.. So bummed out

LOVE this location! Every time I go I feel so welcomed and relaxed. I almost always go to Alivia, who is so wonderful! Tiffany is also awesome and so sweet. I refuse to settle for any other waxing place

Everything was so yummy and fresh! They have so many choices as well for vegetarians and gluten free eaters. It's a great vibe with friendly service! Awesome lunch spot!
