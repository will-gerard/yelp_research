I really wanted to like Croque. I have heard such great things. The menu looks amazing. Ordered lunch to be delivered at pm. I had the 12 inch BLT with the garlic sauce and a side of potato salad. The bread was too dry, it hurt my mouth when I took bites, the bacon was over cooked making the whole sandwich difficult to eat. The potato salad was also very dry and kinda boring :( My friend ordered the tuna wrap and also said it was not too exciing  . I will give Croque one more chance and maybe dine in next time instead of take out.

I totally 100% agree w Serianna T.  I have felt the same way about the seating, and parking and mediocre foods... Postino and LGO are complete cluster F***s for anyone who plans on driving there. I also feel like the general atmosphere is trying so hard to be relaxed and casual that it is stressful for the guests.

This is my 2nd experience with Judy's.. first time was just okay. I had an evening gown taken in a size - Mission completed - nothing to really impress me.  This time I brought in 3 things to be taken in an 1.5 inch each.  They said it would be over a week to complete... quite long I thought.  I came on the due date and they were not done.  A day later... not done  Two Days later... they search and look and finally find my items...  $41 Dollars!!!   Seems ridiculous for the minor work performed. I wont be back

They have Breyer horses! It's so hard to find toy stores with qualitiy toys.  I grew up with a Breyer Horse obsesion and handed that trait down to my daughter. The Breyer selection here always makes my daughter so excited!

Why is there a bar in the bagel shop?? This place is very disorganized. The placement of the bagels, coffees & creamers, chips, soda fountain, cream cheese and a full service bar.... They're in much need of a plan. Something about this place feels dirty to me. Not sure if its because it is so unorganized or the fact the bagels bins are hidden away.  Good I'd just okay but over priced. I think I purchased two bagels with strawberry cream chess and that was $12!

Okay... so little back story: When my daughter was a bit younger (3-5 years), she would come here and have an emotional break down..... everytime. Maybe it was the sugar, maybe it was too much pink paint for her senses, or maybe it was bad timing.  Now that she is older, now 10 years old, we have no issues wtth the place. Great prices, great food and classic service that is hard to find at more trendy locations.  Cons: The check out system Needs a little updating.... not a lot... just fresh paint and new furniture

Who doesn't love CPK? Their craft is a good and reliable as any other family chain.  My review is mainly in regards to my interaction with Tony the manager. He was a dream, helpful, friendly, and outgoing.    I walked to this CPK near my house and I sat at the bar by myself after a long Friday at work, I was hungry and needing a cocktail. Tony suggested a cocktail consisting of tequila and fresh strawberries..... yum!  We had good banter for a while, I had a shot of tequila before my walk home and happily took my dinner home to enjoy.

Giving one star base on the horribly rude service provided to us by Andrea. My two friends came down for our penthouse for a midday snack and could hardly find any place serving food. This was an easy option and it had plenty of patrons as we walked to the bar. Andrea barely greeted us with words or eye contact as she threw menus our way. Poisoned us with gluten filled food when she told us it was gluten free... And over charged us on alcohol.

Had a wonderful dinner her with my boyfriend and grandparents the food was all very good and the setting was beautiful.   We had two plates of the chicken, the kobe steak and the mahi mahi.  The cigar cake was delightful and my grandmother found it very amusing that we ate a book of matches   The downside was that the music was way too loud and we had to yell at each other all night even though we were sitting right next to each other

Always consistently great for me... I love the low carb salad... I see a lot of ppl are upset with the long time for the drive through.  The secret is to park at super burrito and order or dine inside..  or even better call in your order ahead of time!

The worst customer service experience possible. Not sure how to explain the lack of fortitude or the service of employees who do not give s shit. After working a late shift the Bf and i where excited to make a late night run to Del Taco, 6 miles out of our way.   First we order fries and fish tacos and "Julio" told us that the fryers were down for cleaning and we could not order anything fried they offered. Being kinda dead set on our cravings we asked when the fryers would be available to make our food....  Julio said 20 minutes. Having traveled all this way, hungry and tired we ordered crunchy tacos while we waited for the fryers to be cleaned,  Crunchy tacos were delivered cold and thrown together! Stale tasteless cheese and meat surrounded by a cold shell....... All the while we sit in the parking lot and watch three cars go through the service line without an issue. Now were kinda pissed, We wait the appropriate 20 minutes for the fryers to be "cleaned". We go back through the drive through and try to place our order. Again we are met by Julio, he says again that we cannot order anything because they are still cleaning the fryers and are now closing...... 25 minutes early!    We ask what we can order and are suggested to order more tacos and crunchy tacos..... and guess what? THEY'RE STILL STALE!!   The soft tacos are so cold that the tortilla is inedible.......   I understand that you may not have the best of jobs or even life your job,,,,, but that is not an excuse for lies and closing shop early. Those actions speak volumes of  the type of employeez Del Taco is willing to hire or want to represent the company.    No longer willing to go out of my way for this company

Can't believe how slow the service was on a Sunday at 1pm. Waited 20 minutes for a table and had to remind the hostess about our wait time. Once seated it took an hour for our dishes to arrive. I was not aware it took that long to scramble  eggs... I must be doing it wrong at home.

People really surprise me.... What exactly do you expect from a strip mall restaurant? It's manufactured fresh looking food designed to fool the public into thinking that its a healthy and gourmet alternative to fast food. It's not!  Get a clue and stop expecting high school students to provide high dining experiences. The food is exactly the same as every other paradise bakery and it delivers exactly what it is required.

I'm not much of a pastry eater during the week, that's usually when Im dinning out. So I can't really comment on their baked  goods. I will say I find the salads and soup  be very good! The bread served with the lunches is amazing. For the most part Arizona makes horrible bread and this tastes like it was made with water from somewhere on the east coast. So good!

Awe I hate writing bad reviews.... I know they hurt :(  I am writing because I REALLY wanted to like this place. I have heard good things from a good friend of mine.  Went here on a date with my lovely girlfriend for a girls night out. Light sushi fare and cocktails. Ordered the Porn Star martini, love the name... hated the drink... was there any vodka in it? NO... it was watermelon juice.  Our waitress left us hanging high and dry when it came to ordering food and new cocktails....She seemed off of her meds. The runner brought us the wrong food TWO times... and took 45 minutes for the right ones to be served.  Again, I am sorry for the bummer review but I wont be returning for slow service or bad food and cocktails.

Cute neighborhood joint. Ive never had a bad experience here. I'm sure that my experiences here are based on the idea that this is not a "ritz Carlton" high end establishment and I don't expect too much excitement or over the top service. What you see is what you get..... And I've always gotten service with a smile

Once the walls start to close in on me while working from my home, This is one of my favorite "offices" during a weekday afternoon. It's not too busy or noisy, comfy chairs, you can order half sized meals as a light snack, and the staff is very humble and approachable. I can work here for hours and never feel pressured to buy any more food or drink than I need.

I haven't been here a long time but was prompted to return for a brunch date w some friends who had purchased the groupon.  Sat on patio and enjoyed bottomless mimosas. Service was little slow as there was only one waitress on the busy patio.   The Benedict was popular as three of us ordered that dish.  A side of sweet potato fries took forever to come out... Like half way through our meal... Waitress kept disappearing and took forever to get our checks.   Had three separate checks all w the Groupon. Our waitress insisted that the Groupon was only one per table. After rereading the fine print none of us could find that disclaimer. Spoke w the  management and he was able to correct the waitress and we all could pay using our groupons.   Check comes and they're all wrong. Tried of being there and after she tried to correct again, (but they're still wrong). We just wanted to leave.  Kinda of a night mare brunch.

It's pretty good considering the insulting Chinese name of the restaurant.  Have ordered many dishes and they have been better than expected and always show up fast.  The garlic chicken or orange chicken are always my go to!  I use to always order from chop n wok because I lived in North Scottsdale..  That was nasty. Yummy is so much better!

Ok so I used to love the convenience of using the self serve printing options. Never had to talk to the staff or wait in line... It waa great.   Flash forward to now I no longer needed those  services but I had to come in last week to make a double sided picture for my daughter's school project. We arrived at 8pm and the printers were down and we actually needed staff assistance. The place was empty except another couple arguing about the price of paper....for 20 minutes. There waa two employees and only one busy!  Once we were helped the woman seemed like she had no experience using a printer and waa bothered by us wanting double sided. It took her  15 minutes!!   How did you get a job there!!?!!

Went for happy hour on Wednesday with a my work pals. The service was attentive and friendly and the 2.50 beers I will come back for often. The food was bleh.... They ran out of 50 cent wings on wing night and they weren't that impressive. Had to order the boneless wings instead.... Which had the appearance of beef jerky with buffalo sauce. Kinda ruined my well known love of wings.

We are both light eaters,  the easiest thing w could order was two eggs over easy with a side of bacon and sausage, my coffee age her chocolate milk. Waited 30 minutes and paid $33?!?!?  Nothing on the menu enticed me to return again. But it's walking distance to work. Hope their lunch is better

I was so underwhelmed by the OHSO on Indian School and I am sorry to say that this one left me unsatisfied too.  My friend and I just wanted a beer and glass of wine before our movie so naturally we sat at the bar. it was about 9pm and we declined appetizers or food service, our waiter immediately rude about the low ticket fair he would receive. He didn't offer additional services such as refills or details about our beverages.   Almost $20 for two drinks + a generous (unearned) tip -  I would rather pay those prices in the theater.

A happy ending to the story... The manager of this location wanted to right the wrongs and provided me a $50 gift card. Two friends and I ate great food and drank refreshing cocktails.  It's so nice to see businesses do the right thing to retain their customers. BTW THE SWEET POTATO FRIES ARE CRAZY ADDICTIVE!

I really want to like The Vig business. They always find a way to irritate me when I visit. Came on a slow Wednesday evening about Happy Hour time, the place was pretty slow. I had my small (well behaved) dog with me (on a very short leash).  I walk to a table on the patio in the sunshine while my friend let the hostess know that we were sitting outside. She promptly rushed out at me as if I were trying to steall the patio decor, and told me that dogs were not allowed.  I apologized and turned to leave when the manager came out and directed us to a small table at the very edge of the property. Thanks for letting us stay......... I guess.  We settled in and ordered a bottle of wine (our waitress was no help and knew little about their wine selection). Ordered the humus plate with was also "Just ok"  All in all.... I am still not happy with the brand after being to all the locations.   And the humus made me throw up the next morning.......   Thanks for the closure Vig.

Do not let the location fool you!  Albeit, the previous businesses have failed at this corner... I have full faith and want this restaurant to succeed! This is my neighborhood and there needs to be a modern clean cut dinning establishment here. The Standard has a wide variety of American favorites.... which means it is a very diverse menu!    Amazing hand crafted cocktails! A farm fresh menu from local growers! Healthy alternitives to processed chain restaurants nearby!

This post is a bit late but I want to share my experience.  I was having a severe panic attack....that lasted ten hours... Something that had never happened to me before... I was not sure what to do and did not want to go to the hospital. I arrived around 9am on memorial day and I was so happy they were open.  Saw the doctor and he was very supportive and comforting.  He gave me meds on the spot and made sure that I was feeling better before I left.  He and his staff gave me a lot of information on my condition Including medication and helpful services I can contact in the future if this condition continues in the future.

I work very close and often come for breakfast and lunch, The food has always been good and I love that they have gluten free options. It can be pricey if you do choose the gluten free bread though ($2).  I'd rather not spend $10 a day for lunch.    The wait service is pretty attentive and I can tell they are trying to make a good impression.

I'll be nice and start w the goods:  The pizza is good although expensive.  The wings are delicious. I love that they can deliver wine and beer w your order  The bars: Dinned in the restaurant twice and service has been so slow. Waited 15 minutes for our drinks. Waiter may be inexperienced and needs better training. 30 minute wait for wings and 45 minutes for the pizza.   Thank God I had my friends with me to keep me from loosing my hangry mind!
