Was craving some wings so thought we'd catch the game here and indulge. Needless to say I told my wife I'm definitely done with Hooters. The wings aren't that great, they're overpriced and they don't hire their waitresses for good service. Arguably, they don't hire them for their looks either - doh!

This place is nearby so I use it on occasion. The quick wash at $5 is definitely convenient but as far as a full-service car wash I'd go elsewhere. As others have stated, the water spotting is horrible. And service is not so good. Today I opted for a full wash (sometimes I forget why I don't go here :( and although I was the second car in line, the first which was pulling away from the vacuums, I waited 30 minutes to get my car! And then the dreaded spots when I got home.

I went for dinner after not having visited for over a year. I recalled why I stopped going. The chips were burned and I had to ask to have them replaced. They stopped giving bean dip with the chips. And when I got my food it was lukewarm and tasted like fast food. I used to like this place 20 years ago but it is not the same now. Will not be going back unless it is for happy hour.

I feel bad 'cause I know this is a local owned business, it's close to me and I believe has been here since I moved here in '94. Used to be the only store and I never had a problem with it. The employees are great!  Not sure if more selection has raised my awareness or if this place has just degraded in what it offers.  Prices vary - all the markets play their games, price this low to get people in, mark other things up to make the profit. But the selection of fresh produce is lacking and the meat is really mediocre. I have shopped AJ's and it appears Eddie Basha is sending all the good stuff there and placing the leftovers here. Never a great selection, overpriced and I have been really disappointed with the beef I've gotten here.  Hope they can stay in business but I actually drive a bit out of my way to hit the Fry's as they have a better selection of produce and meat. Not great but better for sure. I go here now only if I'm in dire need of some staple item and am too lazy to drive the extra few miles.

The food is fine - it's bagels for crying out loud! The problem here is two-fold: 1) the layout of the place is bad, causing you to queue in the dining area and then wait for your food while you're in the way of customers coming in, going out or getting beverages; 2) as others state - the service is horrible!  Convenient but poor service.

I had driven by this place for a long time due only to it's choice of name and location - I thought "Mucho Taco in a strip mall, how good could that really be?" A friend of mine recommended, so I suggested to my Pops and we checked it out on a weekend menudo outing. I was very pleasantly surprised.  That was some time ago - it is now our normal Mexican food choice. We have not gotten too adventurous (as have some other reviewers) but I can attest to the deliciousness of the menudo (red), carnitas, carne asada, caldo de res and caldo de pollo. The churro's are always fresh and piping hot! I love the Limonada too.  As others have mentioned - great staff - you will likely see the owner  working here. They are always friendly and attentive. The atmosphere - it's a real small place with no frills.

Great food, great service. Excellent quality and yes, you pay for quality sushi.   The owner, wait staff and chef are always friendly and extremely attentive. We have a favorite deemed the "Saturday Night Special" created by a chef  after we sat at the bar and sampled some of his creativity. We arrived at one we really liked and, being Saturday, adopted the name.  Great place and very unexpected for Chandler! Locals would like to keep it to ourselves but the word is out and well deserving of your business! My favorite sushi place - not snooty, great food, great service and no long wait. What's not to love?

Bottom line - when I'm in the mood for Thai in my neck of the woods, this is it. Just beware you absolutely MUST avoid this place at the peak lunch rush - go before or after as it is stand-out-the-door-waiting busy as the Intel crowd (as well as other client√®le) swarm the place for lunch. That is a testament to how good the food is and how reasonably priced it is - as long as you stick to the lunch specials, as others have noted.  Have never been for dinner, so can't speak to that.

I've been enjoying this place for quite a while, figured I should finally review :)  This is not a trendy, upscale, over-the-top sushi place. You will not find the absolute best, most exotic items. But what you will find is reasonably priced Japanese fare that is fresh, tasty and consistent.  I've enjoyed their sashimi offerings - the tuna and the spicy salmon avocado. I've over-indulged on several of their delicious sushi rolls. And my wife is partial to their Tuna Tataki - great sauce!   Has items for my picky, non-sushi eater (fried prawns or the pork tenderloin).  Their service is always friendly but they get distracted or confused or just lost (can't quite figure it out). And I've not seen any advantage to sitting at the bar as in any other sushi place. So some quirks but good food, good prices.

Love Brooksies - for propane but also BBQ essential. They have a friendly knowledgeable staff and their prices are competitive.

I don't care how many times I go here, the wash rarely gets my white vehicle clean. They end up having to wipe my vehicle down with their dirty bucket of water (only after I point out the fact that there are still bugs, bird poop, dirt, etc. left on the surface). The only time it gets clean is when the guy at the beginning does a lot of pre-spray with the wand.  The one time I had my vehicle detailed, they broke my hood release and I had to argue with the GM because he said his folks would have told him they broke it. Oh and my vehicle is old so must've just been time for it to break (it is old but I'm the original owner and have it serviced by the dealer for everything - it's in such great shape the dealer tells me not to buy a new one!). Well it has never had a problem and was not broken prior to taking it in, so I guess I assume... Not sure of the logic - so if it's more than what 3 years, 5 years, 7 years - what is an acceptable age to allow your vehicle to be abused? But I digress. I had it repaired at the dealer and took in the receipt. Was treated to a full service Express wash. Wow!  Too bad because frankly they did a good job - but buyer beware.  My wife will not take the new Acura TL here for obvious reasons.

Contrary to what most people think - Chicago pizza's are not all deep dish pies! I like the occasional deep dish but mainly prefer the thin crust that I grew up with.  When I moved to greater Chicagoland, Rosati's was my most frequently ordered, as it was very close to my favorite small-town pizza joint. This place is true to its roots.  Rosati's has great pizza and if you visit the store, the staff treats you very well as others have noted. The Big Cheef is an incredible Italian beef that I get when I'm really hungry. I recommend adding tomatoes, sweet peppers and some sauce! My wife and daughter love the lasagna.  You won't be able to get one of those $10 pies the chains are battling over but the pizza from Rosati's will blow those guys away any day.

Update after recent visit: while I still find the food very good I have to downgrade my previous rating due to price increases and poor service.   Recently I noticed that beginning with your second bowl of chips you are charged. I asked the waiter about this and he said it was because they found that they were wasting too many chips. To me these are throw-away items at a Mexican restaurant anyway.   It also appears that their dinner pricing has gone up with the food quantities staying abou the same. One comment in my group was "this is Chandler, not Scottsdale! Why are the prices so high, especially for Mexican food?"  I have also been experiencing mediocre service. Recently we were in after the lunch crowd but before the dinner crowd and really got poor attention / service. Particularly since the place was relatively empty.  Shape up El Zocalo or you'll find yourself a victim of this recession. That would be a shame because Chandler could really use a more upscale Mexican restaurant with REASONABLE pricing.  ===========  I don't know why but Chandler is really hurting for great Mexican food. Considering that, this place rocks. My favorite is the Chicken Mole. You cannot find that on most menus period and this is definitely authentic. I also judge a Mexican restaurant on their rice. Most rice is horrible, this place has very authentic rice (I use my grandma and aunt's cooking as baselines).   Next is as mentioned, the ambiance. Great place, particularly when the weather permits you to dine outdoors.  As noted, this is not a cheap Mexican joint. You would think you could find great Mexican food at cheap prices but you'll have to go to El Rancho or the  Food City restaurant (name escapes me) for that.

Good food and the owner really takes the time to talk to customers. Love that!  I have enjoyed several appetizers and lunch courses here. One of my favorite locations for a quick lunch.

Used Yelp to locate a place to connect with two friends staying near the airport. Pressed for time and not really familiar with what's in the immediate area, so decided to hook up here. The Doubletree - place has to be good, right?  Wrong! This place is an embarrassment to the Doubletree/Hilton brand. It does have the exorbitant pricing you'd expect (when I walked in my buds were waiting and first comment I heard was - you wanna order one of the $5 Ice Tea's? lol). But it is in a state of disrepair and needs a serious facelift. I couldn't justify paying the prices shown on the menu. That coupled with the price we forked out for a few beers had us QUICKLY looking for another  place.  This was one of those RARE occasions that Yelpers left me hangin...

This is definitely a hidden gem for Mexican food lovers. If you are not hispanic (particularly if you cannot speak Spanish), this place can be intimidating. But the food and experience is about as authentic as you can get. It's as if you stepped out of the US and into a Mexican Mercado.   You can eat within the restaurant area and get pretty much anything you'd expect from a Mexican restaurant and then some. My dad originally found this place in his quest for the obligatory weekend menudo. We've been coming ever since.  Open up to a new culture and try this place. Be advised, you're not going to a 5 star restaurant. This is a place to grab a quick bite or take-out. Reasonably priced, authentic and as a bonus you can shop for Mexican staples in the grocery, bakery and meat sections of the store.

The dealer I usually use quoted a full replacement of my radiator - with aftermarket parts - at $500! Abel at Chandler Radiator said they can often repair the radiator but would still beat the price (significantly) if it required a full repair.  They got me right in and sure enough, they repaired by replacing the gasket and plastic portion (non-core) that had cracked. No more leaks, much easier on the pocket and one happy customer!  Will give these guys some more business in the future, as Abel advised they do much more than radiators. And I can always stand to save some hard earned cash if the repair is just as good.

Met a couple here so we could experience the Friday fish fry. We both found it thru Yelp - neither of us had been here prior.   The fish was all you can eat but it was so greasy and heavy on the batter that we couldn't really take advantage of that. The chips were sparse, as was the coleslaw. Plenty of fish to go around.   Enjoyed a few Harp's and of course Guinness is on the menu. Waitress was really lacking in service - asked for waters several times, had to chase her down for beers, offered us more fish before we even started on the first.  We stuck around to hear the band. They were a kick and could actually sing some non-Irish songs! Had some fun and got some good people watching time in (this was just prior to St Paddy's day).  Place is dark and run down inside. Looks like some folks use this as their starter bar. I can't fathom going there again myself - bar, food or otherwise.

Been here several times - most recently 8/12/2010 for happy hour. The place gets hopping, so come early for the happy hour!  I personally enjoy their Epicenter Amber Ale and HopShock IPA. Good brews. Decent pricing on the appetizers. I particularly like the beer battered fries that come with the wings. The wings are a little mild, so order 'em hotter than you normally would.  Good place to meet up with the crew - it's a bit too noisy to hold any meaningful conversation, so if you want a cozy intimate place, this ain't gonna cut it. But to toss back a few, get some decent bar food and prime the pump, I like it. Really nice to sit at the outside patio when the weather is a bit nicer.  I really need to compliment the waiter - we had several people in our party, some that came and went. Our waiter was on top of everything, we never lacked for a drink or food. And as each person departed, they got their portion of the bill without any confusion or mistake.

Great place to grab a gyro and it's been here for quite a while, operated by the same folks.   Was in a hurry last weekend and dropped in. Gyro's for the wife and I, the chicken pita (sha-wirma) for my daughter and a burger for my son (he's at THAT age). DELICIOUS. The gyros are stuffed overflowing with juicy, tender meat. Just enough tzatziki that it's not running all over (order more if you like it messy). Wrapped great to keep it warm and allow you to handle on the go.  Fries are good and again, generous amount. These are the thicker cut fries, a nice change from what I get at other fast food joints. I'm not particularly fond of the falafel from this place.  My only regret is that I forget this place serves Italian beef, Italian sausage and Chicago dogs. I'll have to try one and see how they are - after of course I ask what kind of meat, what kind of dogs (didn't see any Vienna Beef signs around).  This ain't no gourmet restaurant folks. It's good and quick food the way you'd get it in Chicagoland.

Nice change from the normal cheap cut I usually get. But frankly my "style" wouldn't pose a challenge to anyone other than a barber school cadet nowadays.   The main benefactor was my son as he finally has a decent style to his cut. The stylist listened to what I told her and added her own touch - he looks great. Much better than that cheap place we usually go to.   As a first time client you get a free MVP upgrade which is the hot towel, shampoo and massage.  It's twice what I normally pay - not sure I can justify my own cut here all that much but I think it'll serve a nice treat. That's the star deduction - too pricey in my opinion.

Lunch today - Teppanyaki grill and sushi. Maguro (tuna) sashimi was excellent. Spicy tuna handrolls good, no complaints. Smoked salmon rolls good as well.  Teppan grill was very good - friendly chef that did a very good job entertaining my small group, answering questions about the menu and the food in general. Everything was cooked perfectly and the quantity of food was good. My only complaint would be the mixed vegetables were a BIT lacking. Could have used more but now I'm being picky.  I (as well as another sushi loving group member) was really impressed with the sashimi, so much so that I will come again specifically for it. I'll also expand to other items on the menu for a comparison check.  Hard to judge a place by a single experience but I was happy with this choice for a small group celebration event. Worth a stop.

Sunday Champagne Brunch  Went for the first time this past Sunday with some relatives visiting from out of town. Good selection of food and the non-stop Mimosa's are a nice touch. While I wouldn't call this a GREAT brunch, I would say that for the price and the location, it is worth a visit.  For our visit they had two salad selections, a few unique appetizers, belgian waffles, made-to-order omelettes, roast beef, crab legs, a very good sea bass and plenty of sweets just to mention the highlights. They were good about refilling everything except the appetizers for some reason.  I found two things a bit odd but not to the point that I'd find this place unworthy. First, the food is staged in the lobby of the hotel with the dining areas off to the side. It's a rather small Hilton property, so I guess they have to make it work. Second, coffee was an extra charge - at brunch? Yeah, that's a nit, but seriously.  I'll go back as an occasional treat from our normal Sunday after church breakfast or quick bagel stop. But I don't think it would be my "go to" place for "the" Sunday brunch. You know what I mean? That place you go to for the special occasion or when you REALLY want to celebrate / splurge.  Property  Our visitors were staying at the property on the executive floor. The room was nice, the executive lounge was nice and they said it was always well stocked. The pool and workout areas were nice.   As I mentioned, this is a rather small Hilton property but it is new, well kept and lives up to the Hilton brand. Our visitors loved their visit - even if it was in the middle of summer monsoon season! Only complaint - the "sip and dip" pool party on Saturday meant they were unable to spend time at the pool (they weren't the young partying types).

The place is now called "the Kitchen" (I guess following the Living Room and Sushi Room theme of nearby joints?).   This had become my primary breakfast joint for quite a while but then it changed ownership and I've decided with my last visit it is officially "over."  Talked to the manager the first time we ate there under the new ownership. We were told the Belgian Waffle maker was broken and there was some issue with the previous owner and payment to the vendor (waitress may have shared a little too much on that ;)  My son would be denied his favorite :(  Also told her the food portions had changed (as in less). Her feedback was that people weren't finishing their food and would actually like less. I asked the obvious question - why the same menu and same pricing? They just took over, things will improve...  So we let the place settle a bit and finally went back a few weeks back (couldn't handle another Mimi's trip). Yep, the waffle maker was not working (had been down for a few weeks). And the menu was the same menu, with some items blacked out with marker.  And the final straw - the food quality was actually not the same. Cold eggs only a dab of potatoes and our waitress was inattentive.

I really tried to like this place 'cause I wanted a place very near me that would be a good neighborhood bar for sporting events and yes, a place that could fulfill my love for wings.   So I've been here on several occasions trying to give it a chance but each time I've received poor service, watching the waitress ignore us (with friends on some occasions, family on others) while chatting exhaustively with what must be the regulars AT THE BAR. And the food ordered by my group was only "ok."  The beer selection is impressive, so I'll give 'em that compliment.  And the restaurant is large enough to get a good seat at the bar or get a booth without a wait. There are television monitors viewable from pretty much any location, so the set up would be great for your favorite televised sporting event.  The wings (the place is called BUFFALO WINGS and rings) are hit and miss - sometimes they were perfect, other times under or WAY over cooked. Once our order was shorted by three wings on a 15 count  order . I don't believe that is an intentional practice but it did happen. The waitress quickly resolved.  So the place could use some consistency/quality control and to realize that new client√®le today are tomorrow's "regulars."

It's rare that my Yelpers let me down, but this was one of the few times. Was searching for a new Mexican restaurant just to change things up - this place had overall good reviews, so took the family and my parents here on a Saturday afternoon.  Service was slow and not friendly: Place was overall dead - only about 5 tables occupied. Several wait-staff present. First I had to stare down the waiter to get his attention and get our drink order placed, when we were ignored by the waitress serving the next table, who walked by us several times in the 10+ minutes we waited after sitting. He seemed in a rush when servicing us, not sure what else he had to do. In the car while discussing our thoughts of the place, my son told me the waiter had rolled his eyes when he changed his order WHILE he took our initial order. Wish he would have pointed that out then.  Margarita was fine, nothing better or worse than anywhere else I've had - not good enough for a second. But the food was why I came. It was soon apparent that this is a "gringo" Mexican place, so I'm rating it based on that.   The queso dip was a pretty good start. But when I got my main dish, the Chile Relleno had more batter than I've seen in a long time. Looked and tasted reheated. Rice was very bland and beans had some weird aftertaste and were not fully cooked (al dente). My dad had Chili Verde and was pretty unimpressed with that. Others had fajitas and those seemed to be ok but not as good as other chains. We discussed in car afterward and agreed it was boring, bland and not worth a repeat.  All-in-all probably a decent place for happy hour (I noticed they had some pretty good looking specials / pricing). But not a place I'd go for Mexican food. Not authentic and not cheap enough to justify bad Mexican food (our bill for 6 was over $120, including 2 kids and one margarita). The service I'll chalk up to our waiter but definitely deducted a star for that.

In-n-Out was introduced to me by some SoCal fanatics - who "schooled me" to order from the "secret menu" (available on their website) like a pro. So a 3x3 was my first experience. I've since decided a double-double is the right size for me.  The food here is the freshest fast food burger shop faire you'll get. The staff (yes, youngsters) is always extremely cheerful, friendly and patient.  If you need a burger and like the thin cut style fries, this beats the heck out of the golden arches less than a block away (or other national chains).

Tried this location for the first time on Father's Day. That in and of itself was a mistake as the place was extremely busy and required a 50 minute wait (hostess said 15-20 min). In the meanwhile we checked the place out and reviewed the menu to determine our order.  Finally seated and our waiter takes our order - brings us back our drinks and then disappears. Our coffee and soda's go dry. The table behind us locates their own condiments and refills. Oh, look our waiter returns - long enough to give us a refill and tell us he was bored. Yesterday was evidently much busier and today isn't even a challenge for him. WOW!   So our order comes out and we have to give directions on what needs corrected. We wait while he re-does my wife's order. Which then comes out cold and still isn't correct. Seriously?  I was told how big the sandwiches are, so I ordered a half pastrami, thinking the $8 price tag isn't really as much as it seems, since the sandwich will be the size of a "regular" size sandwich. Um, yeah, that part didn't pan out. I got a small sandwich piled high pastrami and a little cup of cole slaw. The food itself was good, not great like the hype.   Our waiter - yeah, he's missing again and we get no refills. I also noticed management was MIA. He returns long enough to give us the check. There's a mistake on the bill, which he corrects but we of course have to wait and wait.   My final opinion? Too expensive for the sandwich I had and breakfast everyone else in my party had. The food is good but the price to quantity ratio is off. If this place didn't have the fanboys it does, I'd say it was doomed, particularly in today's more cost conscious economy.

Overdue writing a review for this place. I happened to have to attend several events at Washington school nearby and needed to both kill some time AND get something to eat. Yelpers turned me on to this place and as noted, I've been here several times.  Place has great Pho, fresh and enough to actually feed 1-1/2 to 2 people, depending on your appetite. Or serving for 1 if you're me :)  I've tried the chicken and beef versions and have enjoyed the spring rolls. Rating is based solely on those limited menu selections.

Have only been here twice but good place to grab a drink and the pho and Vietnamese rolls were pretty tasty, although I would say this is a bonus to being in the bar - not the reason to go here. Pizza is just there but frankly I didn't go for pizza either. Owner is very friendly and works hard for her business! But as others note - this is first and foremost a bar.

Great gym for the basics. Not for hardcore lifters as they don't have a ton of free weight equipment (benches, racks, etc.) plus they clearly state "no deadlifting." But as I'm pressed for time and have limited myself to aerobics (plenty of elliptical, bikes and treadmills) and circuit training (30 Minute Express Workout), this place is great, priced right (no contract) and close.

I've been to other Panera Bread Co's in the Midwest - they have always been pretty popular. Me, never really been a fan and this one left me with the same impression - food-wise. Worse was - as other have said - the flow from order to service in the place. Odd layout and awkward waiting area.  Very slow service and the staff members did very little interaction, other than answering questions I had to ask to ensure I was getting the correct order. Are there two bagels there? Is this the whole order? etc. No smile. No thank you when I left.

We had a group, so tried a few of the appetizers: brushetta (manchego, prosciuttio, honey and feta, black olive, balsamic - great combinations),  hummus, shrimp & eggplant w/spicy marinara, and ivy fries. Everything but the ivy fries was delicious.  The ivy fries were interesting at first but really, they're just fries!  We then enjoyed lamb skewers, Shrimp Santorinia pasta, a gyro pita and the Chicken and Lime Cilantro salad. Again everything was delicious.  The only issue I had with this place was the flies.  The doors were open on a lovely day but there were WAY too many flies inside.  Annoying to gross.

I thought I had already written a review of my favorite Sushi spot, but I was wrong.  Perhaps subliminally I was holding out and not allowing others to find this gem, I don't like to share!  The food here is everything you want in sushi - FRESH seafood to be consumed as sashimi or combined with other flavors to create delicious specialty rolls.  Everything I've tried here is excellent - from sashimi to tempura, it's all great.  The owners (Jennifer and Troy) treat us like part of the family.  They really do appreciate your business and it shows.  Treat yourself to the Hwayo Soju!
