I stopped by for lunch the other day and ordered a chicken souvlaki pita.  The girl working up front was very friendly and it only took a couple of minutes to order, get my food and pay.  The pita was really tasty and didn't leave me feeling stuffed.  I'll definitely be back.

I come here to work when I can't seem to focus at home. There are two quiet study rooms which are great if you arrive early enough to snag one.  I bring my laptop but there are public computers which are always in use. Great place to study, work or read a book.

I love this place, we eat here at least twice a week and it's always great!  The service is always friendly and attentive, the food is always delicious and they have the best Iced green tea in town.

I have picked up food for lunch from here several times before because it's close to my office and it was pretty good.  But because I took my food to-go, I never really had much of a service expectation.  Well, today, I was feeling a little under the weather and was craving soup.  There aren't a lot of options near my office so I figured I'd see what they had for soup.  I stopped in and looked at a to-go menu and ordered an individual bowl of soup (listed on the menu for $6.95).  The lady at the counter proceeded to tell me that I could only order it as a lunch special with rice and a spring roll. What?!  Who wants a side of rice with their soup?  I asked if I could get just the bowl of soup as it is listed on their menu.  She then said that she would give me the bowl of soup only if I paid in cash because my order was less than $10!  I didn't have any cash on me and wasn't in the mood to negotiate for my soup, so I left.  Horrible service!  I will not be back.

Ordered an item through Amazon and selected same-day shipping through my Prime account and showed it was being shipped via OnTrac.  Package shows "delivered at 8:39 PM" to front door.  I was home at that time and there was NO delivery.  According to Amazon, sometimes the delivery driver "accidentally" scans a package as delivered and I need to wait 24 hours and then they can re-ship. Why is this carrier offering same-day delivery if they are not even going to attempt to deliver the package on time?  It is incredibly dishonest.  After Amazon's rep contacted them, they admitted it is still on the truck and hasn't been delivered.  So same-day delivery for them is really 2-day delivery.  This company needs to be shut down.  All bad reviews.

I love the new D'lish restaurant in Tempe.  I've been to the Scottsdale location before and was pleasantly surprised by the new location.  It is larger, more open and very well-designed.  I had an iced green tea and the 'man' salad, which was a tuna stuffed avocado on top of a salad already loaded with chicken, bacon, feta and a side of cucumber blue cheese dressing.  I must say, this salad is both amazing and very filling. There were some familiar faces from the Scottsdale location working and everyone was very upbeat and friendly.  If you're in the ASU area, I would definitely recommend checking it out for breakfast or lunch.

I ate here when it first opened and I really enjoyed the spicy, Arizona Cobb salad.  I also splurged and got the chili cheese fries, which were absolutely amazing.  I'm sure they are not the healthiest side option but they are crispy fries topped with chili, cheese and fresh sliced jalapenos, which add an extra kick to an already delicious combo.  The staff was very friendly and our food came out very quickly.  Overall a great experience.

I happened to notice this place as I was driving by looking for somewhere to grab lunch.  Ever since making the switch to vegan after already being gluten-free, finding something good to eat that is also convenient has been a challenge!  The name alone was enough to convince me that I should try it out and I was pleasantly surprised to find that almost everything is gluten-free and most everything (other than the meat, of course) was also vegan!  I had a bowl with veggies, hummus and salad and it was delicious!  Not to mention everyone working was super friendly and helpful!  There was even live music during lunch!  What a cool spot.  Will definitely be back!

My charity group hosted an event here a couple of weeks ago and they were really great; everyone had a good time.  I came back last Sunday because I remembered that they allow dogs on the patio and I had my pup with me.  I met a friend for a quick bite and a glass of wine and we had the best afternoon.  Not only was every single employee extremely friendly, they brought out cute little dog treats that looked like cookies and a bucket of ice water for my dog.  Our bartender even found an iPhone charger and plugged in my phone, which had died.  The food is much better than your typical bar fare and they have very reasonably priced wine on tap.  Overall, it was a great experience; I will be back more often!
