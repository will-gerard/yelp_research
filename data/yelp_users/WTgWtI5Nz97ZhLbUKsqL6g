I decided to give this place a shot, one of my friends recommended it to me. I called and scheduled an appointment with someone and got in right away! Which I was happy with because I was anxious to get my lashes done.  For the purpose of this review I will not share these techs names I will keep their names private...The initial consultation is about 2hrs Tech #1 was very friendly and nice she went through the whole process of me of what is expected. ( I naturally have a lot of lashes I was looking for length and a little bit off fullness and not too dramatic, I've had my lashes done before with others and they usually take about 2:30-3hrs with me) so she began and at first I didn't know how long my appointment was booked for so she starts off with my left eye and from what I could feel she had a good steady pace..I'm thinking to myself thank goodness she is taking her time and not rushing....after maybe an hour and 15min in she switches to my right eye this one I can feel that she was rushing through and I'm thinking maybe she's running out of time....so 20min pass by and someone comes into her room and asks for an update...Tech #1 whispers something back to the other person I'm assuming it was one of the front girls...5 min later she's all of a sudden done with my right eye...I had a weird feeling...when I stood up to see them I saw that something wasn't right on my right eye...i saw that my lashes were clumped together and I thought maybe they just need to be combed out...so I didn't say anything at that time besides that I was in a hurry to get to work...I checked out at the front and singed up for their membership since it sounded like a great deal!  Well I got home and combed through the lashes and well I had a huge gap in the inner corner of my eye,some of my lashes were clumped together, and my left eye was longer than my right eye... the left eye looked beautiful and full and my right eye not so great it looked like I hadn't even gotten then done it matched my own natural lashes! I was so upset that I had to go into work like this, I work in a business where I deal with beauty and I was embarrassed that I had to present myself to clients like this!!! I called and complained and the manager was able to get me in the next day....(I live 13miles away) I show up day #2  and this time I get a lead tech, Tech#2....for a 30min consultation...so she takes a peek at my right eye and right away she does notice the gap in the inner corner so she goes through the other lashes thoroughly and makes a comment "you have several of your lashes stuck to one artificial  lash, you should only have have 1 artificial lash per natural lash" so she went ahead and fixed them and it made a big difference I finally was happy with them! I left satisfied.....well 48hrs later when I go to wash them about 10-15 lashes fell off from my right eye and we were back at square one!! I called again and they were able to get me in for the following weekend when I was free.... The following weekend I show up and I was 10min late the said that my appointment was cancelled and that I needed to reschedule at this point I lost it! I told them this already was an inconvenience for me to do, to get time out of my busy schedule to have them fix their mistake for the 2nd time after their policy says after 15min you will be rescheduled they decide to cancel my appointment...the manager stepped and and was trying to juggle and figure out what other options I had...she said that her next lead Tech would be available in 30min so I decided to wait....Tech#3 brings me back she tapes me up and states that she can see that there were some lashes missing that my natural lashes were really thick and it was hard to distinguish between which ones already had an artificial  lash and those that didn't so she fished through them and did find them and fixed them....once again they looked perfect!   4wks later....time for my fill which was today! I returned back with Tech #2...after she brought me back she stated off with my left eye she was at a steady pace....I noticed the same pattern from Tech#1 that she took a lot more time on my left eye and not so much on my right eye...I was praying that they were going to look even...when she handed me the mirror to see them I noticed that neither eye looked full as a matter of fact they looked the same as how I went in!! I thought well maybe it's because I'm laying down ....NOOOO!! I got to my car and took another look and they did look how I though! ONCE AGAIN I LEFT THERE UNHAPPY HAVING TO GO TO MY CLIENTS WITH UNSATISFIED WORK! I called and spoke to the manager and guess what I have to return on Monday take more time out of my busy schedule to get them fixed!! To my belief I think the tech used the wrong thickness of the artificial lash! I'm beyond frustrated with this at this point if the owner is reading this I would like to cancel my contract!

At first I had a rough start with this place...I had to go back multiple times in less than 4wks to get my lashes fixed...this place does have potential...If their technique was to be tweaked to have evenness through out both eyes it would be at 5 star ....otherwise the managers are pretty good at getting you in ASAP to get any issue resolved....The GM was really good at talking to me and getting my  tech to help me get my lashes back to full and beautiful!
