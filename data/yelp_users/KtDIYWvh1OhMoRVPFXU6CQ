I didn't expect any good Japanese food to come out of Arizona, but Shimogamo proved me wrong. I've only dined at Shimogamo twice, but the quality and presentation of their food was so awesome that it left a lasting impression on me. Apparently, many other people felt the same way because it was packed on a Tuesday night that I came!  The rolls and sashimi are excellent and even the kitchen foods are great. Honestly, I would recommend everything on the menu if it fits your fancy. I personally like to stick to rolls and sashimi and then finish off my meal with a bowl of their porridge (which is really ochazuke, for those who know what it is).   I highly recommend Shimogamo. I picked it as my last meal in Arizona, if that says anything about how awesome it is!

This review is for the Saturday ramen alone. Every Saturday, they serve up a limited amount of ramen starting at 11:30AM. Apparently, the ramen varies and you can check online to see what they're serving up that particular Saturday, but I've noticed it's been tonkotsu ramen usually recently. Their tonkotsu ramen is quite delicious and it doesn't leave me feeling too guilty after eating, aka it does not feel heavy or fattening. And the price is super affordable. Definitely recommend trying...probably one of the more authentic ramen in AZ...

Decor and ambiance leaves much to be desired, but the patbingsu (Korean shaved ice) is delicious and affordable. Perfectly refreshing on a hot summer day. I got the mini size, which is actually very large! Honestly I think a mini size could be split between two people. They sell drinks here too as well as some food like instant ramen. I'll probably come check this place out more often for their patbingsu.

My boyfriend and I had the pleasure of dining here for lunch on their patio. The weather has been perfect for al fresco dining. I was surprised at how extensive their menu is. It was hard to choose because everything sounded so delicious! I ended up ordering the portobello chicken while my boyfriend ordered the lamb and mint. The portobello chicken's combination of flavors was excellent! It went so well with its side of marinara sauce. Lamb and mint was okay. We both definitely preferred the portobello chicken. The pie itself was yummy. I'd love to come back and try more of their pasties.  Side note: If you didn't know like me, this "pasty" is pronounced "pas-tee", not "pey-stee". They're two totally different meanings and you don't want to get funny looks when you're trying to order.

I wasn't impressed with the food here. When I walk into a sushi restaurant that is also selling Chinese food and crawfish, I have to question the quality of their food. The sashimi was okay...one of the salmon pieces I ate had a bone in it. The rolls were extremely disappointing, both in quality and presentation. So lackluster in flavor and sloppy in presentation. Their appetizers were probably better than the entrees. I also thought service was a bit slow, considering the restaurant didn't seem that busy when we were there. I would not want to come back.

Adorable place to grab some breakfast/brunch. Unfortunately, it was too crowded at the time we came for us to dine inside, so we dined outside instead, but it was still lovely. Sunday brunch seems to be a very busy time. It was a long wait to order and long wait to get food. Go before the rush if you can.  Smoked olives appetizer was yummy, so that abated my hunger a bit during the long wait. I ordered the veg crepe, boyfriend ordered the breakfast burro. The breakfast burro was too heavy for my tastes, but I enjoyed my veg crepe a lot. It's basically like a samosa in a crepe, with a little fried/baked cheese on top. You get the tamarind and mint sauce you usually get with samosas.  Yummy breakfast/brunch place, but go early if you can to avoid the rush!

Typical no frills Vietnamese restaurant, but at least the restaurant is clean. Pretty good bun bo hue and pho here...but the pho tastes pretty standard to me. Not special, but still good. I prefer the bun bo hue here over the pho. Their broken rice plate is good. I just feel like their portions are pretty small for the price. Other than that, overall pretty good Viet food.

I really like the ambiance here, but that's about as much praise as I can give Cheddar's. Whoever cooked our meal here was really heavy-handed with that salt shaker. Everything from the appetizer to the entree was really salty for me. I ordered the chicken fried steak. The steak was tough. Is it supposed to be that hard to eat? I'm not sure if my expectations were wrong. There was also way too much batter on the steak. Sauce was salty, our onion rings appetizer was salty, and my chicken tortilla soup was salty as well. Three strikes, you're out, Cheddar's.  I never expect much out of a chain restaurant, but Cheddar's was just really disappointing on this particular visit.

Having lived in California, I'm spoiled by all the shaved snow places over there. I was intrigued to try out what shaved snow would taste like in Arizona. But sadly and as expected, I was disappointed. I tried milk, strawberry, and taro. The flavors tasted really artificial and left an unpleasant aftertaste in my mouth. Milk and strawberry were not good, but taro was decent. At least their boba and custard pudding were pretty good, but I definitely don't see myself coming back here for the shaved snow.

Coming from a dense Asian community in Southern California where there are noodle restaurants galore, I was pleasantly surprised to find a good noodle place in Mesa. I actually really enjoyed the minced pork noodles here. The sauce was satisfying and the portion was generous. I also never would have thought I would find a place in Arizona that would sell lamb skewers! And delicious ones at that! If you've never tried them before, I recommend trying them here. The defining flavor is cumin, and it goes so well with lamb. Pan fried dumplings were also great.   I don't get to find many Asian restaurants in Arizona that impress me, but I'm glad to say that this place gets a thumbs up from me.

My cousin, who is an East Coast native, was pumped when he heard that Shake Shack was coming to Scottsdale. So when it opened up, he took us to check it out.  I ordered the Shack Burger with fries and I wasn't pleased. They really skimped on tomatoes and lettuce and I couldn't tell what their Shack Sauce tasted like at all. Did they even put any sauce in my burger? I was disappointed with the flavor. The meat patty itself was fine, but everything else about the burger was underwhelming. The price was the final deal breaker for me.  Perhaps the Shack Burger was not the best thing on their menu, but for their signature name burger, it was rather disappointing. I read that some of their other burgers are better and that their shakes are really good, though, so if you try Shake Shack, take a pass on the Shack Burger and get something else.
