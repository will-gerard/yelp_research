I hang my head in shame that I did not make this my go-to Teriyaki joint sooner.  I knew of it, I remember eating it at the Matsuri Festival years ago, but for some reason I just did not bother to stop into the restaurant. I'm so glad I did, I now make the drive down Central ave at least once a week to get my fix.  Food is fresh and plentiful. Staff are insanely nice.  And they don't mess around. You will literally get a PILE of chicken in your bowl. Delicious, hot, steamy, falling-out-everywhere chicken. A mountain of chicken, if you will.  I hate that they're not open on the weekends, but I just couldn't bring myself to dock a star for that.

Ahem, it's called San Carlos BAY seafood restaurant.   Anyway, this is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. The seafood is out of this world. I normally only order one dish, the Shrimp in Garlic sauce, and it never ever disappoints. Tortilla, beans and fries come with...but the real kick in the pants? When that delicious sauce marinates everything on the plate, making the fries all garlicky and moist...MMMMM...I can't wrap it all up in the tortilla and shove it into my mouth fast enough.   I also highly recommend ordering a shrimp or seven seas cocktail as the perfect starter.   My family has been coming here for years, it's not in the best neighborhood. Last time we were here the place got robbed. No one was hurt, staff casually called the police, I'm guessing this had happened before. I was just glad the shrimp were okay.  But don't let that deter you! If you like seafood and mexican food you will be in hog (cerdo?) heaven! Mariachis on the weekends too...(just don't be that guy that requests they play La Bamba).

Every Saturday for the last three weeks I've schlepped into Pane Bianco to get my fix. Though I feel tragically uncool in my saturday afternoon "best"(which may as well be pajamas) I bravely step up to the counter, say hello to the nice girls and order my delicious sandwich. And they are ALL delicious. The bread is truly orgasmic. They could hand out slices of the bread with nothing in between and I would still pay $9 to eat that shit.  I'm intrigued by the alleged variety of the market sandwich. The tend to serve the same thing on the weekends, maybe I should try during the week sometime?

My favorite favorite favorite place. Possibly ever.   When I was in highschool my loitering teenybopper friends and I used to get kicked out of here on a regular basis, but I don't hold that against them. We were idiots.  cNstuff has been around forever and is owned by the nicest family on the planet. The minute I walk in there the smell of cheese (or is it sandwiches?) makes me instantly hungry. And there is lots of cheese.   The sandwich menu is extensive and I always have the hardest time deciding what to order. It seems like there is a new sandwich added everyday. Do I want the Doe Boy or just a plain ol' Tuna? Russian dressing or mustard? Sub roll or wheat? For extra you can get a side of chips, potato or macaroni salad (which is a little too sweet for me). There is also a plethora of little extra snacks to fill up on, candy bars, twinkies you name it. Last time in there, there was noticeably less Swedish products on the shelves which was a little sad. Maybe they weren't selling very well? They were always enjoyable to look at.   Anyway, please stop in to this delightful little sandwich shop, you won't be disappointed.  Edited to add: German products, not Swedish. They were Umlaut-laden names so I got confused.

I think enough has been said about Cherry Blossom so I'm going use this review to pledge my love for Zaru Soba. When I was 18 I spent nearly a month in Japan in the Sister City exchange program. It was during the summer and my host mother would always make cold noodles with dipping sauce, a very popular dish during the humid summer months. I nearly fell out of my chair when I first tried the Zaru Soba at Cherry Blossom, I was instantly transported back to my incredible time in Japan.  Cold buckwheat noodles, a light soy-based dipping sauce and a little fried panko fish on the side, the perfect dish for when it's hot as sin outside. A little banana bread to start doesn't hurt either! Say what you will about the service, I often only go at lunchtime when there aren't that many people but I have found the service to be unintrusive and very polite.  Now if only I could find a place in Phoenix that serves Japanese pancakes....

When I was in highschool various clubs used to sell Karsh's bagels around campus to raise money. I would buy a bagel and cream cheese and hide it in my backpack to munch on during class. Soooo good!  I was feeling nostalgic one day and decided to pop in for a bagel and cream cheese.  The guy behind the counter was nice enough, I told him my order which came to $2.95 or something just barely under $3.  I had failed to notice the sign which said they do not accept credit cards for purchases under $3. I apologized and said I didn't have any cash and offered to run the the ATM.  The guy behind the counter very nicely asked other lady behind the counter  (the owner? manager on duty maybe?) if she would let me use my card. She looked right at me all stink-eyed and said "No" and returned to what she was doing. No apology, no "I'm sorry but there is an ATM at so and so...." Very curt.  Thanks a lot personality plus! I will not be returning and I hope you choke on a matzo ball.  Shame too, I loved those bagels.

Nobody understands. I have this weird affinity for Tokyo Express. But only this particular location. I've been to the other's in Scottsdale and Mesa and they just don't taste the same. Maybe it's because I used to come here for lunch in high school and almost everyday when I  worked at my crappy job down the street. Maybe it's just my nostalgia of growing up here and being young(er).... Mostly, I just freakin' love the teriyaki bowls here more than any other 'yaki chain. There is never too much sauce, chicken to rice ratio is always perfect and it's always piping hot. What makes it hit the spot? A large Tropical Passion iced tea...ahhh yes...you go home, add a little Sriracha and it's the perfect meal.  Yes I feel like a loser because it's next to the wonderful Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe and I could get a much better meal there, but when you want something quick and good, this is always my favorite.  Minus one star due to the ambience changing a bit over the years, it's smaller and they used to have this great English-style red phone booth in there, not anymore. Boo.  I realize I've just written way too much about Tokyo Express, but nobody understands! Ah well, I will continue to remain loyal.

Nobody's reviewed this place yet?? Probably because nobody knows it exists. I didn't know myself. I could barely even find the place.  What a cool divey bar/restaurant. I along with my coworkers all ordered burgers and they didn't disappoint. While not the best burger I've ever had it was moist and delicious. Apparently the burgers are saturated in Burgundy while on the grill which gives them their flavor. Fries do not come with, which is always annoying, but we ordered a mix basket with onion rings and fries and it was quite tasty.   Only down note; halfway through the meal my coworker claimed he found a long hair in his burger that he swore up and down wasn't his. Being a self-proclaimed "goat", he ate the burger anyway. I know this would warrant an immediate look of disgust and a one star rating by some....but shit happens. Hair gets in burgers. I'll give the place the benefit of the doubt.   But if you are repulsed by such things, I would encourage you to come here anyway if only to have a drink, the place is pretty cool.  Oh and they do not accept credit cards, so bring some cash if you do not want to be charged a $2 fee from the ATM offered inside.

I remember spending an obscene amount of time at Town & Country when I was in highschool, whether it was loitering around Jutenhoops or sitting on a bench...I thought the ambience was so charming. Very sad that nothing is there anymore.

Love the coffee, beautifully roasted and never bitter. I suggest the Vienna Roast...morning staff is always incredibly friendly. Good pastries. Although the inside is a little small they have a nice patio area, great place to watch people and all their fancy purebred dogs.

I probably wouldn't come here nearly as much if I didn't live right down the street. In all honesty, the food is pretty mediocre.  However, I've found a solution that works pretty well for me: get really drunk, then eat. Four stars for Prickly Pear margaritas and being able to stumble home.  The flour tortilla chips are pretty damn good and addicting. However I've noticed a suspicious discrepancy in torilla chip ratio lately, they seem to be hiding more flimsy corn chips in with the flour. Very sneaky and lame.  And Fideo? Yuck. Uh no pasta with my mexican food please, I'll stick with the rice.  If anything, get drunk and enjoy the wonderful patio on a nice day. I still haven't tried their brunch yet but they had me at Chocolate Fountain.

I'm not a salon type of girl.  In fact, I hate getting my hair done. Having to sit there for two hours (I have a lot of hair), participating in the inane banter with my stylist who is annoyingly way cooler than me. One might say I had serious commitment issues when it came to stylists. I would stick with them for a couple months then leave them for someone new.  My search has ended! I can't find enough good things to say about Bobby. He's funny and personable, he always gives his suggestions  and he never scolds me when I let my hair grow out for WAY too long a time.  Though SS is about two minutes from where I live I would still give it my business regardless, it's friendly and unpretentious and Bobby's the best!

I hate this mall. Whoever said it was Metrocenter for the East Valley is right.  Parking is always a nightmare, the single story let's-all-walk-in-a-circle-like-cattle layout sucks and it is screaming baby/stroller central.   I give this mall one star only because of the Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs in the food court.

I used to live next door to Ted's and I had to have it at least once a week. The hot dogs are fantastic, the onion rings are delicious, corn dogs are superb. Fries could be better though. Only downside: They only accept cash so a ER trip to the ATM may be in order.

This is definitely a take-your-date-here-if-you-wanna-get-laid type of place.   My friend and I checked it out on a Friday night a few weeks ago, I'm all about the low lighting and it's very dark and cool. Lots of handsome African American men in suits and hats. Soul Power was playing, which is an r&b and funk cover band, they were awesome! I got some Mardi Gras beads and I didn't have to do anything dirty. We got wasted and danced our asses off to Michael Jackson..super fun time!

Being a Phoenix native, I almost felt embarassed that I only ate at Pete's for the first time seven years ago.  I had gotten back from England and was trying to recreate the orgasmic fish and chips experience I had there. Pete's was around the corner from my complex and after all, I DID see so many  of those "I'm Addicted to Pete's Fish & Chips" bumper stickers all around Tempe. I had to try it.  I ordered the two fish combo, and my reaction was...what the..?..are they serious?   1.) The "chips" suuuuck. No salt, overcooked and stiff. I couldn't even eat them.  2) The two squares of fish I got were alright, but I may as well have gone to Safeway and bought a box of Gorton's fish sticks.  3.) The red "special sauce".  Wtf? And you have to pay extra if you want tarter? Lame.  4.) No malt vinegar. Enough said.   Why there is such a collective hard-on for this place is beyond me. It's a laughably bad example of Fish and Chips.

I'm not a high maintenance person but I've decided that if I were ever to receive a freakish inheritance of some kind or marry a rich man I would definitely become one of those boozy spa rats.  The Camelback Inn is why.   One day last year I decided I needed a massage like nobody's business and decided to go all out and book a day at the spa. I went with the Soother Package, a 60 minute Swedish massage and Loofah treatment  It was the best day ever.  I had never really gotten a professional massage before, but I was psyched to learn that if you book a 60 minute treatment you get all day use of the facilities (besides the fitness center, I believe).   I got changed into my robe and waited for my massage in the super serene relaxation lounge where they had fresh lemon water, tea and all the trashy magazines I could read. Lovely.   First the loofah rub: a little awkward. Basically you lay spread eagle on what looks like an autopsy table with only a towel to cover your private areas. The masseuse scrubs you down in major tickle areas and you get hosed down with warm water running all over your face. You come out soft and savory but not my favorite.   But the massage...SO fantastic. They put you in a private room with scented candles and soft music playing, my masseuse was excellent. She even rubbed my feet and scalp and did this little tappy thing on my head. A glorious 60 minutes.  After that I wandered around the spa, sat in the jacuzzi, ate some lunch at the restaurant, went for a swim in the pool, enjoyed the beautiful view....bliss. I felt like I was on VH1's The Fab Life.  It cost me a pretty penny but worth every cent.  In fact, I feel another spa day coming up very soon. This time, I'm going for a cabana.

I'm a soda nut, but unfortunately a slowing midlife metabolism has not allowed me to indulge the way I used to.  I come here for one reason and one reason only: Jones Sugar-Free Black Cherry Soda by the bottle. Such an underrated and undersold flavor! Thanks to Pop I can buy the shit by the caseload.  Lots of cool old-school sodas, they also have some candy I haven't seen in a while. Nice, hip staff.

Me gusto El Pollo Supremo.   It's always a sophie's choice between the chicken and the beef...each are equally tasty but I must say that my carnivorous soul favors the beef. Unless my soul is feeling especially gluttenous and I order both. Both meats are grilled to asada perfection, served with flour or corn tortilla, fantastic sweet onions, beans and salsa that I could probably eat an entire bucket of by itself.  Speed of service is hit or miss, I don't recommend coming here during any kind of football event but most times it is relatively quick. Just sit down and brush up on your spanish with an El Voz or read the College Times.  The only thing that sometimes prevents me from coming here is that they only take cash, and I'm often far too lazy to go to the ATM.  But if you have some cash in your wallet and want some good, straightforward Mexican food eat here immediately-you won't regret it.

I never have a bad time at Casey Moore's, I dig the casual laid-back vibe and I love drinking my cider.   My only complaint: I really wish they would put some music on the patio though. Perhaps this is because they don't want to disturb the neighbors, but it doesn't have to be loud....it can be a guy playing the harpsichord in the corner...I don't care. Anything. Something atmospheric would be nice. Maybe some electronica. Cos on a down night it can get really quiet out there.  Other than my phobia of taking a drunken tumble down the front steps in front of everybody I love this bar.

Update: Okay, okay I get it. I came back yesterday and ordered an iced Velvet with whip cream. That.whip.cream.kicks.ass. And they SCRAPE it on as if it were frosting on a cake! I was mesmerized. They had a lovely and friendly barista taking orders, pastries are now safely tucked under a pastry case as god intended. Very nice.

mmmm Delux. I wake up and call for it in the night. I have magnificent dreams about those little grocery carts filled with mixed fries with endless sides of ketchup and that delicious pink sauce. Delux Burger, Classic Burger, Fish Sandwich...always superb. Despite the yuppie crowd, the restaurant often being a little noisy and our last waiter being a little preoccupied and strange we always leave happy.

Coming here, I'm reminded of the feeling I would get in elementary school when I would excitedly look at the lunch menu and find out that it's chicken fried steak day.  It can be a little pricey but you can't beat the selection. Albonidgas soup? Fish tacos? LOBSTER MAC AND CHEESE?? Hell yes! I've never had a problem with the staff, the sandwich-maker dude is always super friendly and patient. In fact, I feel more sorry for them for having to do deal with the demanding yuppie scum that the place is crawling with. I was here this morning grabbing some coffee and the line seemed to consist entirely of crabby old ladies.  Despite the crowd, I love AJ's! If only they served chicken fried steak...

This place is alright, there's just way too many bastard kids running around.  The only good thing about this mall opening is that it makes seeing a weekend night movie at the Esplanade a bit more pleasant, clearly this is the happening place to be for yuppie spawn and I couldn't be happier.

I remember when this used to be a Country Boys restaurant, my bff and I ate eggs and hashbrowns here before going horseback riding for her birthday.  Oh but I digress...this place is boss. Why? Because they don't stop feeding you! You start off with a basket of warm pita bread, and that bread never stops coming. Delightful. After that, a bowl of lemony rice soup that is warm and refreshing at the same time and then your entree. And believe me, everything is good.  The only dish that I have ever been mildly disappointed with was the Moussaka, I wanted to try it and it really wasn't my cup of tea. Maybe it was the pureed eggplant.  Not enough for you? My family always asks for an appetizer sampler in which they give you a variety of cheeses, dips and spinach and cheese puffs. I highly recommend it, it's a great way to get to know the food and stuff yourself silly!  Wonderful cozy atmosphere, lovely staff, a great date restaurant. One of my favorites.

I'll admit it, I'm a sucker for this kind of shit. Overpriced and way too cute for it's own good.  I was in the area and decided to hop in around lunchtime to check this place out. I ended up perusing around for over an hour! Cute kitchen magnets, cute accessories, cute cards...it's all. too. cute.  AND the sales girl was incredibly nice and helpful too...arghhh. I was beside myself. I ended up buying a bag that probably makes me look like I'm trying to be 17 again..but I couldn't resist.  Damn you Frances, you vile temptress. Thank God I live on the other side of town.  Update: Having moved, I now live about 5 minutes away from the place. And my paycheck is truly suffering. (shaking fists) Damn you Francis!!!

This four star review is mostly for the staff:  We came here for a goodbye party for one of our co-workers last week, it was raining and we ended up huddled at the bar by the bathrooms because it was so crowded. However, the rain let up a little bit and we decided to take a chance at sitting on the patio.   The staff could not have been more accomodating, they set up the umbrellas so we wouldn't get wet if it started to sprinkle again, they encircled us with heatlamps, lit the fire and even passed out blankets!  I don't have much to say about the food, both times I've been here I've been too tipsy to really remember if it was good or not. But I highly recommend sitting on the wonderful patio and having a glass of wine.

Girls love carbs. And the fact that Wildflower has bread in it's very name is a thumbs up for me.  My office cohorts and I eat here often for lunch and we are never disappointed. The sandwiches are tasty and fresh, the soup is always good (I recommend the chicken coconut curry) and the pastries are top notch(chocolate croissants!).  And they have bread...enough bread to fulfill every carb lovers wildest dreams. One complaint: Please get rid of the nasty tomato-bread gunge that comes with the sandwiches. It looks like bird regurgitation. It's as if Wildflower said, "What should we do with all this leftover bread? I know! let's mash it up, add some tomato flavor to it and present it as if it were a salad." Kudos to the samples of lotion in the ladie's bathroom however. A very nice touch.

Blah for bland. Got the chicken slaw pita which immediately fell apart the minute I picked it up. I had to douse it with pepper and that bottle of oil they provide you with at the table for some kind of flavor. Would it kill to add a bottle of hot sauce on there too? Somethin'? Not memorable.

On November 26th I brought my vacuum here to get fixed. Too much cat hair.  Two months later I got it back.  The first three weeks I spent calling asking if the thing had been fixed, as I was told it would take "about five days" and would receive a call when it was ready.   A week later, I tried calling, it was near impossible to get the guy that apparently fixes that vacuums on the phone. I was told I would receive a call back. Never got a call.  Forgetting about it, three weeks later I was successful and was told my vacuum had mistakenly never been moved from the "waiting to be fixed" pile. No apologies, but was again told I will receive a call when it was fixed. Never got a call.  At that point, I was morbidly curious to see just how long it could be for the goddamn thing to get fixed.  A month later I called for shits and giggles and was told it had been ready and I can come and pick it up. Never got a call or message telling me it had been ready.  Never again.

Plus, CH doesn't sell kicky toys and calenders you can put on your desk at work. Such has saved my life many a Secret Santa time.   But about that Border's Rewards...when the hell are the rewards gonna start comin'? The cashiers never seem to be amused when we ask them that question.

What exactly is a noodles ranch? A ranch that wrangles noodles? If so, I want to live there. It always makes me giggle as I think of the Cuttin' Corral, where Napolean Dynamite gets his haircut.   I also admit to knowing nothing about Vietnemese food before eating here, but I'm so glad to have discovered it!  So fresh, always consistently good. The menu is enormous, my favorites being the spring rolls in peanut sauce, the Bun bo xao which is beef stir fry in vermicelli noodles and the combination Pho soup. All the drinks are good, including the Jasmine iced tea, the Ginger limeade and the Vietnemese iced coffee. Sadly, I agree the portions are rather small for my fat american ass...but that just means more room for dessert!!

So I'm getting old and tired and I work in social work. I'm looking for a cheap(er) place to go for regular stress relief and to address the nerve pain I've been having in my neck, most likely from hunching over paperwork and suppressing my rage towards some of my co-workers.  This was my first time at Massage Envy, I booked the hot stone massage. I had gotten one before and it was awesome. I was excited. My masseuse was a lovely woman but I was very unimpressed...I'm a bit of a masochist when it comes to getting rubbed down. I want a woman with slow hands and a not so easy touch.   Basically, I want it slow and I want it hard.   Maybe I should have been more specific when filling out my paperwork, but I felt as if I was getting a massage from an apathetic boyfriend in a hurry. The hot oils were nice, but all she did was simply run the stones over me, way too quickly. There was no attention paid to pressure points, there was barely any pressure at all.  I was pretty specific about the neck pain and there was no extra attention paid to it whatsoever. I've gotten more relief at the salon when getting my hair washed (*cough* Bobby at Moments is awesome).  Not worth the $78 plus gratuity. Maybe I'll try again with a different masseuse, the regular membership prices are pretty tempting.

It's funny how much more you can appreciate a place once you don't have to work there anymore. Such is how I feel about The Coffee Bean.  I worked at this location for almost two years, and while I was miserable pretty much the entire time I still enjoy coming here for coffee. One of the reasons being, I love the location. Being a bit more off the beaten path, it caters to a more neighborhood-y crowd for being a chain. A lot more regulars and not as many tourists(except during Spring Training time which always made me especially suicidal when I was an employee).  And the coffee is pretty decent. There aren't as many selections of flavors as Starbucks but I always thought the quality was better. I highly suggest trying the new Pecan Praline latte which is delicious, plus the blendeds are far superior due to them actually being BLENDED and not chunks of ice.  The place closes at 7pm all week so it's not exactly a nighttime hangout. Of course when I worked there closing time was an annoying and unnecessary 9pm....it's nice the bastards finally get their act together AFTER I leave. Oh and for all you guys out there, the place is next to Ford Modeling Agency so you can see models, yes real models, probably on their go-sees milling around carrying their little portfolios. It's very ANTM.

Since I'm on a Torta fix, I had to try this place out.   I felt pretty "guera" walking into the place as all of the customers were clearly spanish-speaking only as well as most of the employees. Embracing my latina half, I ordered a carne asada torta to- go in my best spanish, which is about on par with a three year old idiot child.   Be warned, not the quickest torta you're gonna get, I waited nearly half an hour. Luckily, they have telenovas playing on the tv, which are fantastically amusing, even if you don't speak the language.   But it was well worth the wait-my torta was delish! I got it with everything, which included pico de gallo, lettuce and mayonnaise, all on grilled bolillo bread. Amazing. They have a huge selection of tortas so there is something for everyone.  mmm tortas, where have you been all my life??

A couple co-workers wanted to go see the Minibosses last night and despite being dead tired and not caring much for the Minibosses, I reluctantly decided to tag along and check the place out.  Talk about off the beaten path. I wouldn't come to this part of town unless seeing one of my crazy clients at the residential facility down the street or to score some rock myself.  But I was pleasantly suprised, what a great little joint! The inside is cozy and dark with soothing red light and painted red walls adorned with saucy pictures of buxom naked women. Immediately you get that the vibe is super laid-back, with smatterings of people at the tables and at the bar and "roadies" and band members darting in and out.  I don't care much for crowds so I am always very happy to be able to sit at a table, have a drink and watch some music undisturbed. Although I would have rather listened to the DJ than the Minibosses, I liked the intimate feel of the place and was very excited to see there is an 80's dance night (Sundays?), plus there is a Wells Fargo right across the parking lot for all your ATM needs.  I definitely plan on checking this place out again, a nice little find!

100 flavors of milkshakes. And I didn't try one. I got the cherry "shaker" soda instead. I'm still kicking myself for it.   This place is a dream for the control freak. It's also a nightmare for the indecisive. You get to choose how big you want your burger, what kind of cheese and what toppings you want (and there are lots!)...plus all the damn milkshake flavors.   After taking about 20 minutes to decide what I wanted, I settled upon the "semi-serious" burger with cheddar. My counterpart and I shared a basket of "frings" which were fantastically greasy. My only complaint: the bottom half of my hamburger bun was paper thin, while the top was practically an entire loaf of bread. You get more than three toppings and you get one messy basket. Just put the top bun on the bottom as well, I say!  I adored the glasses made out of jelly jars, apparently that's how they do it down south as we were schooled by our Missouri-born waiter. I myself never considered Missouri to be part of the south but...to each his own.  I'm looking forward to fattening myself up on many of their shakes in the future!

MMMMM....finally checked this place out last week and I'm so happy that I did. I can't stop thinking about the burger I had! Smokey with a great , grilled-in-your-backyard taste, with pickles and mustard. DELISH.  As I pulled up to the drive-thru window I couldn't help but notice the sticker "The people at Yelp love us". YES WE DO!   A true diamond in the rough, I will be back.

Though Trader Joe's has better prices, I find it too small and stifling and it's too far for me to drive.  SO F&E works for me because it has all the pre-packaged meals a girl-who-doesn't-cook could want and the tiramisu is tops.  Also, I was shopping around the other day and was delighted to find they now carry authentic british Heinz beans in a can. Hell yeah beans on toast! The way it was meant to be made.  Only negatives: -No paper bags. I eventually bought my own kicky F&E bag, but I forget it everytime I go. So the point is moot.  -You have to eat shit really fast before it expires. Fortunately for me, this is never a problem. -I'm hoping for a greater selection of foreign beer. Overall, I enjoy F&E for the convenience...and now mostly for the beans.

Oh I'm in love and I didn't even try the pizza.  The fam and I ate here for my brother's birthday last week. I remember walking in and thinking I wasn't really in the mood for pasta..then a plate of italian flat bread was placed in front of me and the rest of the night was a complete blur.  All I remember was drinking wine, eating bread, drinking wine, antipasto salad, ooo calamari fritti! more wine, delicious chicken special,more wine, tiramisu. All fabulous, all scrumptious. I want to eat here every day, and I want that chicken thing I ate. But I can't remember what it was called. Sorry.  I will be back.

It's all about the Kahlua Kicker.  Unfortunately there's no booze in it but it's just as good without (almost).  Frighteningly perky staff. Either it's the caffeine or they're suckin' on the whip cream, but they are way to happy for college students working at a coffee shop.  I was very sad when I moved away from Tempe only to have discovered Dutch...but fear not! That building that's being constructed on Central and Camelback, it's gonna be a Dutch! Now I can shop at Francis and enjoy my Kahlua Kicker whenever I want. Elation!

Okay, I'm going to have to recant my previous review. I just had a totally fantastic lunch of Torta Carne and corn on the cobb. That Torta is off the hook! I gobbled it up tomatoes and all and I flippin' hate tomatoes. The corn is slathered in buttery butter and cotija cheese, add a little pepper and it is sublime.  Service was super fast. Call me Mary Kay but the two cuties behind the counter made the wait pretty tolerable.  America, I'm sorry I snapped. I didn't know. I will be back for my Torta as it is now on my list of foods-I-want-every-day.

(Sigh) people of Arizona, why do you continue to annoy me with your shitty and illegal parking jobs? It was 1:30pm. I thought since it was after the "peak" lunch hour I would be safe. All I wanted to do was get a tuna sandwich TO GO and I ended up being nearly blocked into that tiny, narrow parking lot due to all you old fogies plowing into any space you can because you had a hankerin' for some chippers.  While there I witnessed a car illegally parked in the handicapped parking space, one parked in the "to-go" parking spot (obviously NOT getting to-go) and some asshole next to me who made the most comically bad attempt at parking I have ever seen (I took pictures, see my profile).  I waited in the long line, finally got my sandwich and decided to eat outside so I could see what the idiot looked like. Well the person was either as old as Arizona and still trying to chew their food or an employee. I I got tired of waiting and was finally able to leave.  And they put tomatoes on my sandwich after I told them not to! So moral of the story is; avoid this location anytime around lunch. And if you see an 80's era Mercedes Benz station wagon you have my permission to piss in the gas tank.

I like it. Great location, nice ambience, you can drink your coffee and watch the action go by. I made friends with a lady and her giant fancy poodle. Pastries are kick-you-in-the-crotch good. Service can be aloof, but tolerable.  Not much else to say, except the hours kind of suck. Lola is slowly creeping to the top of my favorite coffee places.

It should be called Giant Pastries!   I bought a poppy seed muffin and I think it weighed nearly a pound. It was comically big, the girl behind the counter and I had a laugh. Hard to complain about that though!  I like this place, despite being cash only and having next to no parking. The staff is really nice and helpful, thanks to them I got turned on to the honey vanilla latte which at $4.00 for a 16 oz. is a rather expensive but delicious revelation.  Only complaint...the pastries are SUPER sweet. Almost unbearably. I had a bite of the muffin and my face puckered like Renee Zellwegger's.  Another great little coffee shop to kill time in before work!

Leggo my manchego.   So I looove manchego cheese and am elated that I get to put it on my hamburger. I also love my burgers big and greasy. Topped with some zinfandel braised onions and it's a combination dreams are made of.  The kind of burger you hold to you and whisper "never let me go".   Okay, that's a little melodramatic, but damn it's a good burger.   The fries are a bit of a disappointment, Delux's are better. I've only had the chocolate shake which I shared with my sister...also excellent.   4 stars for manchego-y goodness!

Dr. Mr. John,  Thank you for completing the triad of evil in this Camelback strip mall. What with you, Chipotle and Corleone's, I might just reach behemothian status by Christmas.  However, I take comfort in the fact that I can add sprouts to any sandwich for free.  Yours,  Michelle A.

Despite the extra $1.80 guacamole raping, I could still eat barbacoa crispy tacos every day. I try not to, but there have been stretches where it's been a hard week at work. And I'm not ashamed.
