I will never use GrubHub or eat at Stumpy's again after my last experience. The order took about 30 minutes longer than expected. When it did finally arrive, it was cold and we were missing about 1/3 of the items we ordered. I even pre-tipped them a 30% tip in the hopes that it would arrive a little quicker. Nope. I emailed GrubHub, they said they spoke with Stumpy's and the missing items were on their way. Well nothing ever showed up, the restaurant never refunded our money for the missing items and GrubHub shrugged it off with a "we're sorry, here's $5 off your next order" canned reply. That was a fraction of the value of the items we were shorted. This fly-by-night service is DOA in my book. I'll use other local delivery services going forward and steer clear of shady-Stumpy's. I cannot believe they would say they delivered items when they did not - TWICE!!! The whole experience was pathetic and disappointing.

My 76 year old mother went in to buy replacement pads for her pool vacuum and was treated extremely rudely by Bob. He was the only person there, busy, and spoke in an ornery tone. I was on the phone listening to him yell and just talk like a jerk to my mom and other customers. Bob needs some anger management classes. And this store needs to ditch Bob in place of someone who can be polite and knows a thing or two about customer service. NEVER patronizing this store again.

STAY AWAY!!! This is a bait and switch shop.   I was quoted a price over the telephone (I was comparing prices on rear brakes which had already been inspected) and was told the entire process would take about 45 minutes. I hurried in. About 40 minutes after I arrived, Scott "The Manager from Corporate", told me the price would be double what he had quoted me over the phone. When I told him to take my car down and give me the keys, he told me he'd honor the original price. Smart choice!   He then told me it would be about 45 minutes, to which I didn't respond. It actually took over 4 hours for them to complete the work. Scott never checked in with me or gave me any updates. When I asked him how much longer, he told me about another 30 minutes...which meant another hour.   I have never seen so many upset customers all pour into a business at one time. One lady came in and threatened a law suit and to contact the Better Business Bureau for some shoddy work they did two weeks ago. Another customer came back and complained that they hadn't put an oil cap back on his car and his car was now acting up. And another client, a doctor, who came in for a $9.99 oil change was on his cell phone complaining to a friend that he'd been "roped into all kinds of extra services". He was here for about two and a half hours...for a $9.99 oil change.   Do yourself a favor and STAY AWAY! Do not patronize this unethical establishment. They are the Kings of OVER-promise and UNDER-deliver.

Dr. Song and his team are WONDERFUL! They are very friendly and true experts in treating our French Bulldogs' allergies. They have an extremely convenient location too - just off the 51 freeway and Glendale Avenue. I HIGHLY recommend this amazing group of people.
