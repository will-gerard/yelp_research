99% of the time, I sit in the bar area... Happy hour prices and food choices are outstanding.  Food is perfectly cooked every single time.  Service is impeccable.... and the oysters, mmm mmm mmmm.... even though its a steak house, the oysters are always delicious and perfectly shucked!

I just had the most beautiful gel nails done by Rose. I'm so glad that my friend referred me to her because I've never had anyone so meticulous before. They are truly a work of art. I highly recommend Rose.

The food was heavily salted, and I mean steak fries encrusted with salt... after sending back the porterhouse t-bone with onions, mushrooms and fries that were inedible , the waitress returned with the steak and offered to bring the rest of the meal later.  When food arrived later the steak was cold although they said it was recooked, the steak fries had bowls of sauce placed in the food... Now I personally don't want dishes thrown in the middle of my food .  Our waiter JB was polite and professional,  he needs to be hired elsewhere ... the female waitress and I presume manager who returned with food with another server was rude and he was a lier.  THEN my son found a long black hair in his food and vomited.  Will never return.

I would never go back here, the vet is rude and arrogant. Both him and staff talk over you while you're asking questions about your pet. Overpriced and lacking in communication skills.

While the food can be sometimes unpredictable such as undercooked, overcooked, over salted etc...  except the swordfish which is predictably always awful - however, the customer service is always impeccable. We come here frequently and never leave disgruntled...  This evening we were fortunate to have Christian as our server; she was patient, extremely pleasant, prompt and efficient- we will ask for her section next time.

This is by far the best sushi in the area... They didn't have "Inari" or even know what it was, but their sushi was fresh, delish, and not OTT pricey. Def has become our "go to" sushi restaurant from now on.

This place never ever again. My earlier review today was in error and meant for a different nail salon. The reason I stopped going here was because they do not sterilize all their utensils. They pull out clippers etc from dirty dusty plastic containers...

What a gem of a restaurant ... The pizza was delish, their poutine was the BEST!  They were accommodating to my last minute reservation of 30 guests- when we're in Montreal again we will definitely stop by

Fabulous food; a must try is the German pancake, their poached eggs are perfect... Love this place, and the server Justin brings out food when it's still hot- He's awesome!
