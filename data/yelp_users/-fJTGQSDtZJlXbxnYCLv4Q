Great unique finds!  I always can go in there and come out with some good picks.  I have been able to find some LAMB and Juicy purses for 50.00 at the most and they are authentic and in good condition.  My only issue is that they do try to under bid you on purchases so be careful and know your prices on things you sell to them.

Lucas is Awesome!!!!!  I was a little apprehensive about getting two Louis Vuitton bags repaired by someone other than the store.  However, I looked at previous reviews and they were all great.  Lucas repaired both of my bags quickly and you can't even tell where the handles were once ripped.  I will be coming here for all my shoe and bag repairs!!!

My car needed to be serviced urgently and service fit me right in the next morning. The problem was immediately diagnosed and addressed. Every time I have visited I have always had a pleasant experience. Also Judd is so helpful and outgoing and always has a smile!

If there were a rating for NO STARS this place earned it!!!! I have been to this location before and the food was good. However, I came in on a Saturday afternoon and it was a complete 360! The lemon chicken soup lacked lemon and chicken. I swear the meat was pulverized and it was loaded with carrots. I ordered spinakapeta it was burned on the outside and COLD inside. Have no idea how that happens. I was extremely disappointed with the food and the service and won't be back.

It's cool I've been on Friday and Saturday nights and they were both good. The dj was spinning good music, so that helps a lot too!! Love some Hanny's

They must have changed their buyer prices because now they low ball you for your things and sell them at much higher prices. You're better off with offer up or Craigslist to sell your stuff, plus seller beware they told me when I dropped off a bag of things that I had to accept their offer and they wouldn't give me my things back!!!

The best food and drinks ever!!! My friend and I stopped in on a Friday for our happy hour stroll. We were greeted and served by Matt he was sooooo awesome!!! He let us sample one of the specialty menu items and talked to us through out the night!!! The servers were all really pleasant. The sangrias and empanadas were to die for!! I will be back!!!
