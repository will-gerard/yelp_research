This store has set hideous customer service standards! I was lied to about their return policy by an employee and screwed over! They gave me the run around when I asked to speak to a manager...she was conveniently never present and was the "only one who could help me." When giving me the final verdict on my issue, she cowardly had her employees do it for her on the phone (of course not face to face) and could not even call me herself. I highly recommend taking your business to a different pet boutique where quality service matters!

Hands down my favorite Chinese place I've been to in Phoenix. I've gone through soooo many bad Chinese places in the Valley per recommendations from people who obviously have no idea what good Chinese food tastes like.  I had pretty much given up. I was beyond happy to find this place. The service is fantastic. The staff is sweet, friendly, and often humorous. We've celebrated a birthday here and the staff was kind and accommodating. The food is delicious. The egg drop soup and lo mein are my favorites, but I enjoy everything I eat here honestly.  The prices are great and the food is fresh and they have happily provided adjustments to our orders if we didn't want certain ingredients.  It's not "traditional" it's definitely Americanized food, but it's a complete delight.

By far the best Mexican food I've had so far.  Their enchiladas rock!  THE BEST MARGARITAS IN TOWN!!!  I never taste the tequila and all I need is one margarita.  I love their chips and salsa.  Their servers are always nice and very attentive.    Definitely try this place out!

The pizza and calzones are just OK here.  I've been here several times.  The atmosphere is pretty good, especially at night.  I wish the food was a bit better though. For the pizza, I found the sauce a bit watery and crust to be mediocre.  The calzones are OK but I've had better.  The appetizers are OK as well.  I did enjoy the dessert.  However, the staff has been quite friendly every time I go to meet friends there.

This place is great!  The food is very tasty.  The prices are low and the staff is really nice.  I really enjoy going there for lunch because they serve you a spring roll and soup as soon as you walk in.    They have the best spring rolls I've ever had!  Their dinner menu has a lot of good dishes to choose from.    I also liked that it is set in a diner atmosphere.

I decided to try this place because I attended a fashion show where this salon donated their services. I was so impressed with the quality of hairstyles I had to check it out. This is my favorite salon in the Valley. It's got such a fun and friendly vibe. I have been there several times and tried several stylists. Every single one of them was fantastic, friendly, and willing to show me different ways of styling. The shampoo experience is reason enough to come here. They massage your head forever! :) I actually fell asleep once. They take their time cutting and don't rush me out every time. I usually go in never knowing what I want and LOVE every haircut I get there. It's always something different and modern. I've been to places like Dolce where the stylist couldn't wait for me to leave as soon as I arrived, was unfriendly, and gave me a basic cut that looked straight out of 1998.   This place doesn't disappoint. Give a try, it will be worth it. The prices are comparable to other salons, their cuts are a bit cheaper than what I've seen at other salons too. Love it!

I loved my experience here. I never experienced any pressure selling and felt attended to completely. This place carried Stephanie James dresses, but I definitely couldn't afford the prices for those. But they had dresses of  similar styles in a lower price point available as well. I loved the staff here. They were sweet and extremely professional. Their customer service was outstanding and I have to say, that was a big reason I wanted to buy a dress here.  I also ended up buying one of my hair accessories here as well. They had a unique selection and made the effort to make this purchase feel really special, which meant a lot to me. I highly recommend checking out this shop!

I have enjoyed OHSO several times. Love the food and the drinks. Love that it's right off the canal and is bike and dog friendly. However, what I really want to review is their event planning. They are the only place in town who would work with me when planning an event for 50-80 people in which they did not require a deposit or that we spend a specific amount per hour, and did not require us to buy off a specific menu. They did separate checks for EVERYONE! The staff was friendly and attentive to work with before and during the event. Their staff followed up with me all the way up until the event. They allowed us to take over a substantial portion of their patio, they were friendly, had staff working specifically with our tables, and had super speedy service. I highly recommend them!!! Our party goers only had glowing reviews!! Based on this experience, I am happy to give them my business and recommend them to everyone!

I have been to my share of salons in the Valley, this is the only place I will go from now on.   This place is cool, artsy, funky, and fun. I love how it feels vintage and modern at the same time between the art from local artists on the wall to the arcade games and old school salon chairs.    I get my hair done with Jorge. BEST SHAMPOO EXPERIENCE IN THE HISTORY OF TIME!  I typically get my hair cut, but recently had my hair styled for a wedding I attended.  I love my hair every single time I walk out of here!  Jorge is a talented stylist who listens and offers spot on suggestions for my hair. The service is friendly and attentive here. The prices are extremely reasonable.  There is no pressure selling of services or products. But, you should try the Kevin Murphy products from here, they smell wonderful and work really well.  You should go here. Seriously, go here, you will be happy you did. :)

I was a huge fan of Gallo Blanco and was skeptical of what restaurant would take over after they left. I am happy to say that Cafe Tranquilo has been a fantastic addition to the Clarendon Hotel. I live within walking distance of Cafe Tranquilo and tend to go there almost weekly. I am thrilled to have such a great spot nearby. Their menu is solid! They've made fantastic changes to their menu since they've opened. I've enjoyed their breakfast (try the chilequiles) and dinner options. If you're just hanging out for happy hour, get the guacamole, tacos, or Elote dip....you won't be sorry. They serve Lux coffee, major bonus points there! And a HUGE shout out to our server Jake!!! His service has been top notch and his recommendations have been on point. Thank you Cafe Tranquilo...I will likely be back within the week. ;)
