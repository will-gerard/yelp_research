I waited 2 hours while the front desk clerk was having insurance mix ups. There was only one nurse and one np there seeing patients. The pre exam room where they take your temp & blood pressure is tiny and gross. I will NOT be going there ever again. The only good thing was the np was great.

Been there twice and this is our "wing place" now. Tons of sauce choices and great wings & fries. Service was wonderful and happy hour beers are resonable! Not fancy, but awesome experience!

I can't say enough wonderful things about this place & those I have met here. I have grown so much in my yoga practice just by taking classes here and absorbing all that the amazing teachers & fellow yogis have taught me. The teachers give the best adjustments & tips to help you get deeper into poses than you ever felt possible. If you want to grow and enjoy the journey, come in & try a class! Eva & Jason (owners) have put their heart into every square inch of this place. What a gift! PS... coffee is amazing!
