Impressed with the service, food and atmosphere! Between the amazing food and great employees I have nothing but great things to say about this place!  My husband loves the lobster mac and cheese.. and he is not a picky eater.. so I was expecting it to be so so but man let me tell you... its AMAZING. A must have for mac and cheese lovers!  We sat at the bar tonight and both the bartenders were awesome! Very attentive and friendly. I like when servers actually get to know their customers.. I work in the industry so I pay attention to detail and that's huge to me!   I will definitely be back to this location mainly for the awesome service I I recieved at the bar tonight!

Went here tonight, will never be back.  The food is typical bar food, nothing too extraordinary, I already knew what to expect from previous visits. But the service was beyond bad.  Just an obvious example of poor training and poor management. Our poor server was obviously sent out to the wolves and had never served before.. (mind you she had 2 tables.)   The most annoying part, was that the manager literally went to the table in the middle of the restaurant, SAT down with them, and explained that this server was new and had messed up stuff earlier.. I could hear the entire conversation. How unprofessional can you be? I understand we were at a "sports bar" but to throw your own employess under the bus is just messed up.   Not only that but why couldnt they maybe come around to every single table (3) and see if they needed anything? Or maybe HELPED out your servers rather than needing them to go and find you while you are outside smoking? Ridiculous.  Id like to be able to say "Oh it was a busy night I understand." But this was obsurd, at one point I even went to the bartender to ask for my sons water (The server brought out all the alcoholic beverages BEFORE bringing my sons water) And the bartender gave me a look like I was asking for her to do backflips, told me she didn't have "To go cups" and rolled her eyes.  This place obviously doesn't work as a team, and it shows.. Never mind the crappy food, dont go here just plain and simple because the service absolutely sucks and the management and other employess obviously do not care how their restaurant is portrayed.

Went here for my first time tonight and am genuinely impressed!  My husband and I sat at the bar and had some wine and appetizers and I will definately be back for more! The bartenders were nice, the food was great, and the atmosphere was awesome! There's nothing I like more than being served by people who genuinely seem to enjoy their jobs. The bartenders made great conversation, filled our drinks the second we needed more, and our food came out quickly! Kudos to wildfish you obviously take pride in your restaurant  and staff!

Thoroughly impressed with this place! Good atmosphere good service and quality food! I'm a picky eater and had lots of questions and the wait staff was great! I could taste the freshness of the veggie appetizer that was suggested To us! Will definitely be going back for more!

My visit to Lipogenex was nothing short of amazing. They were very accommodating from the start, working with my schedule while making an appointment for me. When I arrived at the center it was a very relaxed atmosphere with quiet music in the back ground. I have tried Botox before but never Dysport, so it was very comforting to have the Physician explain to me the difference between the two and how the Dysport worked. After a week I noticed a very big difference and have been very happy with my results. It goes with out saying that I won't be going back to Botox after trying out Dysport!  Kristin was very helpful in letting me know about the other services that are offered here and I will be back for sure!

Went to this location this after noon and am pretty disappointed. I've worked at buy and sell places before so I kinda know what most of these places are looking for but let me tell you.. This place is beyond picky. Which is surprising because u to go thru the racks of clothes and a lot of it is pretty worn, stained, torn, or just genuinely cheaply made clothing.   I think the most disappointing part though is the customer service. Everyone working there just seemed annoyed. It's not that hard to smile people! I've worked in customer service my whole life and find nothing more upsetting than rude employees!  I won't swear off platos closet just yet because I have had good experiences at the arrowhead location! Maybe it's just the Scottsdale mentality that these people need to get out of!

The last few times I have been here the customer service has been so great! Everyone has been so friendly and seem to genuinely care about how the store is perceived! Glad to see they made some changes since my last review!

Insanely rude staff. Couldn't get any help even after asking where to find a certain pair of sandals. One of the girls was trying on shoes while on the job!!! Ridiculous!
