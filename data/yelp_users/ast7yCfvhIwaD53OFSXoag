I flew out of (and into) this airport for the holidays. The process was painless once inside the airport, but their setup with the roads, ramps, and terminals is so absolutely convoluted. I've never been to a more confusing airport with regards to traffic.  That being said, once inside, it was quick to check-in and get my bags checked. I also was traveling with my puppy who was so warmly welcomed by everyone, staff and otherwise. They had no issue with him being out, unlike other airports.  A huge perk is a dog park they have outside Terminal 4 to walk dogs before/after flying. Made me feel a lot less nervous about the 5+ hour trip across the country, and I'm sure it made my dachshund a lot happier too!

I've begun dog walking with RESCUE, and they board their pups here when they're being treated after coming from the pound.  The lobby is very clean, the dogs healthy and happy, and all the staff so friendly to all the pets and their people coming in and out.  Their boarding prices are also very reasonable - much better than some other boarding locations I've checked.

NOTE: This review is for dog boarding only.  I took my miniature dachshund here on a whim. I had actually called Ahwatukee Animal Hospital but they were booked for the weekend, so they recommended Ahwatukee Commons to board my puppy.  Long story short, it was an affordable, nice experience. The price wasn't too bad (though I've used cheaper) and everyone was friendly enough.  My *only* almost complaint was the woman behind the counter was in training, but it seemed as though her coworker was helping with every little thing. Her coworkers and the vet's assistance who took me back with my puppy seemed incredibly knowledgeable and affirmed my confidence in leaving my puppy in their hands for the weekend. Hopefully the training isn't too grueling or take much longer for the new hire!  When I picked up my puppy he seemed no worse for wear (aside from a raw nose from the kennel bars). They also give you a "Kennel Camper Card", which is pretty cute, and includes some arbitrary information about your pup's stay.  I'll definitely consider using their boarding or veterinary services in the future.

Cracker Barrel is, usually, a favorite of mine. I love the tacky store out front with all the silly gifts, decorations, candies, etc. I love the environment inside, with the fire place, checkers, and little triangle game on the tables. But #1 is the food. I love good ol' Southern food!  This Cracker Barrel's food was lackluster, at best. The food wasn't even particularly hot. Their sweet tea was a disgrace in the name of sweet tea. The grits were absolutely disgusting and an embarrassment to have been served.  I have to admit, I wasn't totally surprised - we're nowhere near the actual south. But nevertheless, I came in hoping for a tasty delicious southern meal, and left hugely disappointed.  On the upside, the service was fine. Nothing spectacular, but not a huge letdown either.  I won't be revisiting this Cracker Barrel.

I'm always wary of Whole Foods because I always spend too much money. This trip was no different, but this Whole Foods is a level above the rest!  A friend of mine and I just wanted to stop in for some snacky items to go with wine for a light, tasty dinner. We decided on some fruit, meat, cheese and a couple bottles of wine. The gentleman in the wine/meat/cheese area was incredibly helpful, pairing a wine for us with the meats and cheeses we chose. He also gave us ample samples of the meats we were interested in.  We also stopped by the bakery to pick up something sweet for after dinner. We got a few cannolis, and the woman behind the counter gave us an extra one - just because!  Granted, our bill wound up being over $100 just for these items, but after everyone treating us like quality, regular customers, I would come back just for the level of service.

I moved into Hyde Park Apartments and have to say, I'm pleasantly surprised by how well run the complex is. In the past, my experience with with apartment complex management has been... unimpressive. Nevertheless, not everything is perfect, either.  THE GOOD - Management is super responsive, super helpful, and really do seem like they're there to HELP you instead of just take your rent check. I have had to contact them several times about a few issues, all of which they have tried to resolve same-day. - Management also has lots of small perks for residents. They send out birthday cards, have Halloween bags available for trick-or-treaters, offer drawings for prizes every month for folks who pay rent early, etc. These small treats add up. - Prices and ongoing new resident lease specials make it worth your while to live here.  THE BAD - Despite having same-day help, my toilet STILL does not flush well. Since I've moved in it has had a very weak (sometimes incomplete) flushing mechanism. I've had several people check it out, including a guy's whose snake got caught within the pipes. It has improved, but is still terrible. - While the residents aren't particularly noisy, the floors/ceilings are quite thin so you can always hear your neighbors walking about. There are lots of children too that play together in the grass outside.  THE UGLY - I've found and killed two roaches in my kitchen since moving in. Management does offer a terminator to come in and spray, but with animals in the house I tend to do this myself just so I know a) what poison I'm using and b) where the poison has been sprayed.  Overall, I'm pleased with this complex. The imperfections are either not a part of management's control, or just a result of an older building, and I am looking forward to living out my lease here.

I'm a lot like Patti K. in that I dread the dentist. I'm lucky to have great teeth and have gotten away with neglecting them in the past, but I've had a cavity that's been progressing as of late and finally has started to bug me. I was a bit nervous to go to this office not only having clearly been neglecting my teeth, but also having a piercing underneath my tongue. The last thing I wanted or needed was to be judged!  And that's the last thing I experienced in this office. It was clean, modern, everyone was relatively young, super friendly and talkative, you name it. It was a very comfortable experience (aside from having pointy metal things jabbed in my mouth, but that's unavoidable).  I'd say the only thing that was weird was the wait when I got there. I arrived around 1:45pm as a new client, signed in, and helped myself to new client paperwork behind the counter. I filled out said paperwork, returned it behind the counter, and continued to wait for about 30 minutes until employees emerged from the back. Later I think someone mentioned something about a staff meeting, but wouldn't you think they could leave a note on the front desk...? It was a really strange start to my dental appointment, but it only went up from there.

The last time I got a filling, it was a miserable experience and is the #1 reason I've been putting off visiting the dentist for the last three years.  I went in for fillings this morning and arrived about 5 minutes late. Nobody seemed irritated at my tardiness, there was no rushing, and I still got out in an hour and a half - exactly as long as they said it would take.  My comfort was priority. Dr. Amy & Kristen were super attentive to body language. They would feel my hand every so often to see if I was tense, gave me breaks to rest my jaw, gave me vaseline for my lips to prevent chapping, and complimentary happy gas was of course a plus. (All of this while watching Office Space? Win!)  The really refreshing part is that one of my fillings was very deep and potentially in need of a root canal. While it looked ok today, Dr. Amy warned me it could progress a bit, even after being treated. If for any reason I have to get a root canal in the near future (within the year), she will only charge me whatever is in excess of the filling she did today. A dentist with a warranty? Awesome.  Overall, this was probably as enjoyable as getting a filling can be. I am not dreading my next dental appointment at all.

NOTE: This review is for the workout areas and smoothie bar only. I haven't had a chance to take advantage of the spa yet.  This gym is remarkable. I've belonged to incredibly nice gyms before, including a country club, and this gym easily compares in quality.  The employees are generally very nice, though many of them have sales in mind. They seem very genuine, but are pushy nevertheless. If you're comfortable with saying no and walking away, this is a non-issue.  The smoothie bar is a bit pricey for the size and quality of the smoothies. I tried one of their smoothies and it was... ok, at best. The whey protein was extremely noticeable and almost grainy. The smoothie tasted under-mixed, and the staff behind the counter seemed agitated.  The workout floor is absolutely massive. It seems like an excessive number of machines, frankly, but I really can't complain about that. I have almost my choice of any machine in the joint considering it's 24 hour and I go late in the evening.  I still need to try out their classes and spa, but from what little I've experienced in my week of membership, the $50/month price tag is MORE than worth the facilities. They are always clean and always open.  BOTTOM LINE: The price is worth what you get in return.

NOTE: This is the first and only shooting range I've been to, so I have nothing with which to compare my experience.  THE GOOD - The prices are right. I do agree with some other reviews that the targets are a bit pricey, but you could feasibly buy these elsewhere and just bring them in if you wanted. Ladies' Shoot Free on Fridays is obviously *very* good pricing for those gun happy women out there. - The employees are very friendly and professional. I've only shot guns on two occasions - both at Shooter's World. I already feel much more experienced, and never felt "dumb" as they explained how to use and load the weapons. - Their variety is good enough, but not overwhelming. - Lane managers keep an eye out on the lanes pretty closely. They've come up to us to ask us to change something we might be doing incorrectly, and always in a firm (but friendly!) manner.  THE BAD - As mentioned previously, a few items they offer are pricey (namely targets).  THE UGLY - As with any shooting range, the folks shooting around you can definitely make or break a good experience. I do find that they don't space out folks very well; there will be lots of open lanes, and then lots of taken lanes bunched together. I'd feel much more comfortable having space between me and a stranger wielding a loaded weapon.  BOTTOM LINE: I've been here twice, and I'm sure I'll come again. Ladies Shoot Free Fridays is just too much to resist!

NOTE: This review is based on a piercing (conch) experience only.  THE GOOD - My piercer, Plaid, was efficient, quick, and about as pain-free as possible. - The shop was really nice, clean, and actually surprisingly large. - The folks working here are very friendly and not condescending at all. I have my share of tattoos and piercings but they're all mostly hidden; I've definitely walked into shops and been treated as inferior, but not here! - The price is fair. It was ~$50 for the piercing, including jewelry and tip.  THE BAD - While this certainly isn't their direct fault, I purchased some piercing healing spray and the bottle didn't work after I got home, which meant I had to make the haul back to this location to get a replacement. The chick behind the counter acted like this happened all the time... so why don't they check that the bottle works before they hand it over?  THE UGLY - The location is incredibly obnoxious. It's on the corner of University and Country Club in a somewhat run down corner shopping center. The two roads are busy and make it very difficult to get in and out. To alleviate this, try to visit at off hours.  BOTTOM LINE: I'd definitely come back here for another piercing, and quite possibly a tattoo!

I submitted a request on their website late on Wednesday night for a ride early Friday morning. I hadn't received a call yet on Thursday, so I made other arrangements and called back Ridesmart to cancel my request. The conversation went something like this:  Me: Hi, I had put in a request on your website but I wanted to cancel it. Him (in weak English): What time did you? Me: Late... Him: Oh, well after 8pm, we cannot... Me: I know, except that this ride is for tomorrow morning. Him: What is your name?  ... I gave him my name, and that was that -- it was cancelled. There was no attempt at retaining my business, there was no attempt at even explaining a lack of response. If it's that they don't even GET the form requests put in after 8pm, they should definitely say so. I particularly didn't like having given them my credit card information in the request form -- what is that about?  Not having a confirmation (or any form of contact) about 12 hours before a ride is way too nerve wracking for me, particularly for a flight the Friday before Christmas.

OVERALL: I would eat Cheba Hut every day if I could afford it.  THE GOOD - The subs are consistently delicious. It doesn't matter who's behind the counter, they will taste the same - EPIC.  - The service is rarely slow, even when it's busy. And for the quality of food you get, that's a-ok! And more important than speed is personality. Every person I've met at this Cheba Hut is outgoing, friendly, and awesome.  - The munchies here are abso-freakin'-lutely phenomenal. You'll notice the regular rice krispie treats tend to be out fairly often; there's a reason for that. OMNOMNOM!  THE BAD - The price. While I don't mind paying it since it's worth it, I can say it is a bit on the pricier side for a sub, and can't blame anyone for complaining about it. Particularly since it's a college crowd and many college students pinch pennies, this price makes it a bit harder to come here too often.  THE UGLY - The menu. Because it's so big it's almost overwhelming when you're not in the, ah... right state of mind. But it's manageable once you've been here and have your go-to sub! :)

This was going to get 4 stars because of the wait, but the owner, Bela, loves VWs and has a bunch of VW magazines in the waiting area, so that bumped them back up to 5.  The wait was pretty long, considering I had called ahead to try and make sure it'd be the least busy time of day. It sounded like they might've had someone call to say they needed their car at the last second. Nevertheless, Bela took matters into his own hands and did the oil change himself to help speed things along.  The shop itself is easy to find, but the driveways on either side of the buildings are for the garages ONLY - go to the center driveway with the small "McClintock Center" sign. I made this mistake, got to drive around the U, and make my way back to the center parking area for customers.  It's clearly a family owned business, they're down to earth, super friendly, no shenanigans. I almost wish I needed more done to my car, because I've definitely found where I'll be coming back.  If you need major work done, or routine work, PLEASE do yourself a favor and come here. Particularly students! They're not overpriced, are honest, and are willing to run students to school for class so they don't have to wait at the shop.

OVERALL: I'll be back, and probably very soon.  THE GOOD - The service. It was incredibly speedy (unlike previous pho experiences) and everyone was incredibly friendly. I actually noticed many patrons knew the employees well enough to ask about family and recent trips!  - The broth. So good. While I was too full to finish the massive amount of tasty noodles, I still made sure to drink all my broth!  - The price. For a huge, delicious, satisfying meal and taking home enough for later, $12 wasn't bad at all. I definitely didn't need the appetizer of spring rolls and that would've knocked me down to $8 easy.  THE BAD - Being new to this restaurant, I walked in a bit aimless. There was no one waiting to greet and seat, but at the same time this isn't self serve. I walked up and asked if I should seat myself and grabbed a menu, but the guy behind the counter acted like that was a bit out of the norm. It was mildly awkward.  - This restaurant is quite casual and *almost* divey, in that each table has its own napkins, spoons, chopsticks, etc. The table I sat at had only 2 napkins left and very little chili paste, but I didn't see anyone moving to restock it anytime soon.  THE UGLY - Good pho has a bit of a kick to it, and Khai Hoan doesn't disappoint... so when your water runs low or completely out, it's a bit of a bummer. They did refill it eventually, but it took them longer than my mouth wanted.

This Target gets the job done. Their shelves tend to be in a little disarray, and their makeup selections are generally lacking, but other than superfluous purchases I didn't even need to make, this Target has never let me down.  The grocery section is probably the cleanest and best in the store. I love perusing these aisles.  Their clothing section is pretty diverse, but because the store is somewhat small, it's packed in tight. It's a challenge to maneuver the area.  The biggest perk is its central location to southern Tempe. It's also very rarely busy during the day, which is awesome!

The service was nice, fast, efficient. There are many cats running around (and when I say many, 5+ at least), so those with allergies will definitely be hurting. I'm slightly allergic to cats and I could just tell the dander was getting to me even in my brief visit.  I recently got a miniature dachshund and I just needed to get his shots up to date and whatnot. It was a painless process, everyone was very friendly, and we left with a clean bill of health.  I will however say the bill was a bit surprising. $200 for a first visit and usual puppy shots? Ouch. Assuming I don't have to come here often, I can suck up the price since the service was great. Otherwise, my doxie's checkups will need to go elsewhere.

I, for one, love Ikea, but this review is for this particular Ikea and not for Ikea as a whole!  The employees on the showroom floor are... ok, at best. They're a bit discombobulated and mostly unhelpful. We were misdirected once or twice with regards to mattresses in a sofa bed. This isn't a big deal, but was just worth noting.  The showroom floor was also a bit of a mess, but this Ikea is also bustling, so you can't really be surprised about that.  The marketplace downstairs is equally as crazy, and employees here are impossible to find. Fend for yourself! We also found that the marketplace was pretty disorganized as far as where lamps and proper bulbs for said lamps were located. I found this odd, since other Ikeas I've visited have had all necessary accessories within arm's reach of the main product.  This Ikea really shines in their warehouse and customer service. Their employees here are efficient and helpful, and assist you with a smile. We had some special order products that had to be pulled from the back, and this was a quick, painless process that didn't tie up our day at all.  I also had to exchange some stuff at a later date at the customer service counter and this was a fast, flawless task.  Bottom line: once you figure out what you want, this Ikea is awesome. I'd recommend doing your shopping online or from their catalog and then going straight to the warehouse.

How have I not reviewed Rock'n'Roll fingers yet? I come here every other week, and have never been disappointed. I always get the regular plate with the BBQ sauce.  - The chicken fingers: I read elsewhere in these reviews that they aren't "crispy", and that is absolutely correct! They AREN'T crispy. They're breaded and fried, but in such a way that the chicken is so moist, so fresh, the breading is simply there for a bit of texture.  - The fries: they could easily be frozen fries, but you know what, they're delicious and go perfectly with the fingers. They are seasoned as well, which helps a ton!  - The Texas toast: ... it's Texas toast. What more needs to be said? YUM!  - The sauces: While they push their special sauce, and the special sauce IS good, I just love their BBQ sauce. I don't know if it's in-house or not, but their fingers just go so well with the BBQ... and that's saying a lot since I'm more a chicken+ranch kind of girl!  This place isn't gourmet. This place isn't fancy. It's a bit cheap on the inside, and has small games at the booths for entertainment. It's a bit pricier than you would expect, but you also get a heaping plate full of food. The folks in there are friendly and recognize familiar faces.  I say disregard the few negative reviews here. If you like chicken fingers and fries, you will leave 110% satisfied. I promise.

I was in dire need of a fresh look, so I decided to drop by MAC after work on a Saturday evening. Of course it was incredibly crowded, but they still managed to get someone to help me.  The makeup artist was very attentive and made me feel comfortable despite it being so busy. She took the time to show me how to use every product, how to apply every product (making sure I applied it myself) and was very encouraging. Granted, I'm sure she wanted to make a good sale, but it did feel genuine!  I think what really made it for me was that she wasn't afraid to make mistakes... and correct them. When trying to match my foundation color, she chose one a bit too light. She immediately noticed the error and found a better shade, rather than forcing it to fit and blend it in. This really stood out to me.  She also paid attention to my wants. She originally chose a very bubble gum pink lipstick, and while I could tell she loved it, she could tell I did not. We discussed what exactly I wanted and were able to decide on a more nude pink.   I walked out of here having spent over $300 and do not regret one penny. I now have a very fresh, personalized set of makeup and brushes that I have used regularly since!

This is one of my favorite Targets in the area. I like the way it is setup, it's not *too* big but has a good selection, and is always pretty tidy. The biggest issue with cleanliness is people leaving their cups or drinks around on shelves randomly.  Generally it's not too busy, and even when it's been busy I've never really had to wait for a register which is absolutely unheard of at Target. That alone deserves 5 stars.  The employees working here are outgoing and extremely friendly.  Overall, this is a great Target, and the best I've found in the area thus far.

I came here for a scale. They had none in stock.  The store itself was relatively tidy, though a bit strangely organized.  Took me a while to find someone to help me, and then took them even longer to tell me they had nothing in stock, even though I started off the conversation with "there are none on the shelf".  The employees were friendly enough, but the overall experience was meh, even for a Best Buy.

I love this Fresh & Easy. Moving from Florida, I was dreading not having Publix for my groceries anymore, but Fresh & Easy is a fantastic alternative. Granted, their variety of fresh produce isn't the best, but it gets the job done.  I'm most impressed with their cleanliness and prices. I'm always surprised at how cheap my total is at the counter as I'm checking out.  Also, unlike some much lazier reviews below mine, I love that the checkout is done by the shopper, much like it is in Europe. However, I've had to bag and have had someone bag for me equally; it just depends on how staffed and/or busy they are at the time.  The staff has always been very friendly, helpful, and interactive. A clean shop and respectful employees... that shows true customer service, not the level of laziness they cater to.  Either way, I highly recommend this Fresh & Easy, particularly if they have coupons or specials running that coincide with your shopping list.

Let me begin this by saying I don't remember most of my time at Sanctum. But, that's a good thing, right?  The music was good, the environment was awesome, and the bathrooms were super cool.  We had a large group, had plenty of alcohol, and danced our butts off on the dance floor. The sound system was great, and the lights were fun. The bartenders were quick and friendly.  If I remember correctly, we had no cover charge either. I don't know if that's normal, but nevertheless: win!  BOTTOM LINE: I definitely plan on coming here again in the near future.

I dropped by just to pick up some papers. Their music was up pretty loud, and the joint was totally empty.  The chick behind the counter was nice, though no salesman. She made no effort to show me anything or sell me anything, even though I'm always open to new goodies.  Their pipe selection wasn't bad, though I've definitely seen better.  Overall, it was a substandard shop and the biggest factor for my dropping by was convenience. I'll probably look elsewhere for future head shopping needs.

How have I not reviewed Pita Shack? I can't begin to tell you how perfect their gyro is. You just have to go eat it for yourself.  The meat is not greasy at all, but not too dry. The gyro has huge, spicy, fresh white onions on it, along with some nice big tomato slices. Their pita is absolutely divine.  Their side greek salad is generous and the dressing is phenomenal.  The price is also right. It's not ridiculously cheap, but it's more than reasonable, and I absolutely love coming in to order my food.  I love Pita Shack and eat here almost weekly. I cannot recommend them enough! Do yourself a favor and come have their gyro!

A large group of friends and I came here for some drinks on St Patty's Day. Considering the huge amount of people on Mill Ave, plus the huge amount of people at Fuzzy's, I was actually really impressed with being able to get a relatively clean table, and the service.  It wasn't perfect by any means, but their beers and drinks were green, delicious, the right price, and easy enough to get. I think inside there was table service, but we simply went up to the front or the bar when we needed our drinks; this kept things simple.  We did not eat, so I can't give an opinion on the food, but their pre-mixed margaritas and their green beers hit the spot! I'd definitely come back here to try it on a regular day.
