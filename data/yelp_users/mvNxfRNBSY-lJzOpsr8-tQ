I am being kind with the 2 star rating. This places only saving grace is the marinade they smother everything in.  The steak kebab's had the chewiest meat I have ever encountered at a Mediterranean eatery.  The vegetables did not taste or look fresh and were slathered with way too much marinade.   The so called seasonal fruit was a joke. Almost $3.00 for a few cut up pieces of sub par fruit.  Too much money for what was a terrible terrible terrible meal.  Skip this place and hitup one of the other 30 eateries in a 1 block radius.

If not for the slow naan bread delivery this would most certainly be a 5 star review. The food is delicious and for the price it can not be beat. The lunch buffet is always a smart choice and I feel I have to specifically point out how fresh and insanely tasty the naan bread is. I would come here for that alone.

Unlike most nearby places the coffee was great and the prices were far from extortionist. Also sampled the hot chocolate which was great when paired with one of their delicious homemade cookies.   Service was quick on a busy Sunday not much else to say they do coffee quick and good.

Place is pretty busy which is more of a testament to the typical Phoenician not knowing what decent pizza is. As you enter you are left with the choice of seating yourself or standing in the middle of the restaurant like a moron. Take a seat at one of the many unbussed dirty tables and get ready for the 5-10 minute wait before you are greeted by the ONE waiter for the whole place.   The pizza is just not good. I'm not sure who they have making the pizza but he should be fired. The pizza was soggy and watery. I'm not sure if this was because of the canned mushrooms(lol really) or poor quality cheese. I have encountered oily pizza before but watery pizza is a first.  The chicken parm hero was edible that's best thing that can be said about it. The calamari was rubbery and of poor quality. If you are going to use frozen pre-made calamari you should at least buy the higher quality.

Usually eat here about 2-3 times a week during lunch hours. They put out a pretty healthy menu and the qualify of food is high. The bison burger protein style is a great option for lunch.

Just had to update my review after another great lunch. The service was amazing as always and the pizza was out of this world.   You should also try the spicy chicken soup if it's on the menu and order the kale dip for an appetizer.

Great coffee and awesome pastries. The strawberry scone is insanely delicious. Owners are always friendly and go out of their way to remember names and faces.   The homemade cream soda is also a great choice.

Decent Sushi for the Phoenix area. Atmosphere is pretty chill and eating lunch at the Biltmore is always fun.  Service was pretty quick but the ever changing menu is annoying and the waitress on our last trip did not even know it.  They also routinely run out of the fatty tuna which is lame.

Terrible service. We had to wait over 20 minutes just to get drinks and don't even get me started on how long it took to get food. I have an idea lets have more than 1 waiter working on a Saturday night. Food was underwhelming to say the least. We ordered the "jumbo" crab cakes and they were the size of a quarter.

Let me first say that I have eaten here more than 10 times and usually it is always a 5 star experience.  That being said on this night they were out of 3 main dishes due to them not getting their "meat delivery".  This was not brought up when we made our reservation nor when we were seated. Only after our drink order and being seated for 20 minutes did we find out they were out of 3 main dishes. One of which is the extremely popular French dip sandwhich.   They could have saved me time and themselves a terrible review by being upfront with the delivery issue.  Unacceptable

An outside taco stand in Arizona? This must be madness you say.  Well no this is just delicious street tacos done right. I stood outside on line at Wadaa's stand in 100+ degree weather for 15 minutes just for the chance to get a few of these amazing street taco's.  Yes street taco purists will frown at the addition of cheese or maybe the lack of radish slices but not this hombre. The options are limited: chicken or steak. No matter which you select you will be satisfied.  This place is also open till 3AM and 4AM on Friday/Saturday.

I really want to like this place but the food is too inconsistent and the service is highly dependent on what waiter you get.   It's almost like dining here for the first time on each visit. You have no idea what the al pastor tacos will end up tasting like. The homemade corn tortillas taste like homemade garbage. Pray that the waiter remembers to ask if you would prefer flour tortillas. Hint: you do.  The only bright spot is the Mexican street corn which is probably the unhealthiest thing on their menu.  I am almost embarrassed at how many check-ins I have at the taco guild. I have a theory that the prime location is the  only thing Keeping it in business.  Stay away

If you read through the other yelp reviews on Bonefish Grille you will come to the conclusion that this restaurant has decent food but terrible service.   Well Bonefish Grille is nothing if not consistent.   We made a reservation for around 7:00 and were seated right away. We then spent the next 5-10 minutes waiting for the waitress to come over and get our drink order. We ordered our drinks and the bang bang shrimp appetizer. Another 5-10 minutes pass by and our waitress comes back to take our soup/salad and dinner order. We asked her for some bread at this point because we were starving.  Our bread and salad/soup came out a few minutes later and we were finally able to eat something. Our waitress came over to check up on us and inquired why we were sent our soup and salad before the appetizer. I gave her a sarcastic reply which was not well received and she proceeded to bring us our appetizer which was followed by our main course 3 minutes later.  It saddens me to give them a 2 star review because the food was delicious we ordered the sea bass and the filet with lobster tail. We also ordered the chocolate creme brulee for dessert which they were of course out of.  4 star food with 1 star service.
