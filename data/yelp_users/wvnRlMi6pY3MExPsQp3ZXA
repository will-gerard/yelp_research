New Manager is amazing.  Very professional, engaging, up beat and friendly.   Service and food was amazing today.   We haven't been here since January, so glad we stopped in today.  If you guys had a bad experience on your previous visit.  You have to try this place again.

One of the worst drive-thru experience ever!!!!!  We have repeat our orders 5x.   Turn on ur volume on ur head phone should be the first priority.   The girl take care of the drive thru need to relearn how to work at the drive-thru.  Haven't been to sonic before, will go to another location next time.  FYI be ready to repeat your order over and over.

Upon arrival I was on the phone with one of the clerk (Betty). This wasn't my first visit to this location.  I asked her do u guys still offer 3cents copy for Tuesday.  She said yes we do, I reply that's great. I explain to her if it ok if I can email the copy over for them to copy for me because the clarity.  With a rude tone, she said no we can't.  I work with the owner today and he said no, starting to ask what business am I working at.   That's not really her business to asked. Anyway if you want to come in here make sure don't ask for Betty or ask for another clerk.  Unprofessional and rude!!!!

I love Popeyes since I was in California.   This was the worst drive thru experience. Very unprofessional when taken order.  Customers services is the most important thing in any business.  I guess they don't take it seriously.  Train ur staffs well before letting  them run the store.  If the owner or manager is reading this. Please take this into consideration.
