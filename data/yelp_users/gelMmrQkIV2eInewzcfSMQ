I have always been pretty satisfied with these wanna be Chipotle's. Been to a lot of different Qdoba's and the food and service has been  consistently solid.  Until I spent half an hour at this place.   I was one of only 3 customers to come in the whole time. When I walked in both female employees were sitting at one of the tables and chit chatting. They didn't look happy that I walked into their empty restaurant and interrupted their conversation.   One of the girls got up and dragged herself to the counter to see what I wanted. Told her chicken ancho burrito. After she heats up the tortilla she asks me if I want chicken or pork. Not a big deal, but try and pay attention, I know you are extremely busy and all.   When I pay I ask why they are so slow. She says they have been slow all day. Whatever. Get my drink and there's trash at the beverage counter, there's 3 empty napkin holders, trash on the floor, and 4 tables with trash on them.   You would think if they were slow all day the place would be spotless. As I sit there eating my (actually quite tasty) burrito the girls head back to their table and keep on yapping. Fail!  You barely get the 2 stars because the burrito was good.

Yeah, I know its just an Arby's, but I was pretty impressed. The place was clean, fast, and tasty. The side salad was very fresh and crispy. Employees asked how everything was while I was eating too. Great Pepsi soda fountain as well with drinks you don't normally see. Only complaint is the lack of healthier food choices, but yeah, it is an Arby's. At the exit door, there is a loud bell you can ring if the service was good. When it rings, every employee yells thank you or whistles so that the customer that rang it can hear. I thought it was a nice touch and I rang the bell myself.
