Great winds, pizza, and beer. This place does not get the credit if deserves, hey sell pizza by the slice and is centralized.

So FAR the best chicken waffles and sides of the West coast. I was not impressed with the macaroni and potato salad but otherwise still the best. Roscoes was not as good in my opinion as the chicken was dry. Here it was juicy, tender, and very moist.

I've gone to Maria for years, she never fails to impress. Very professional and always gets the job done.   Just remember that patience is a virtue so if you have to wait, it's a part of life.

I visited the store a few times to gather information and pick the right bike for me. On both occasions there were plenty of employees and no one ever acknowledged me or ask if I needed help when spending a great while in the bike section. I finally purchased my bike on line and decided to have it shipped, to avoid it not fitting in my car. They offered free assembly online and I did not think I needed it. When I received the product, it had no tools or assembly instructions, so I took their offer "convenient and free assembly" I borrowed  a friends truck and dropped it off, the next day after waiting 24 hours I called the store for a status, I was told that it could be a few days.  I picked up the bike and went home to assemble it, the hardest part was attaching the break wires. I got it done. I was not happy with the fact that one would have to wait several days with no ETA as the bike tech just comes in when he wants to.  This is bad service, they should have a better process.

The pricing is moderate and the service is great, I've been going to Lisa for years and have come to rely on her for her expertise. If she's not available only second best is the owner, always willing to please a customer.

Great place to sit back and enjoy a bowl of soup and a side of iced coffee. It's inexpensive, authentic, and very delicious. Family owned and operated, so come on in. Don't be afraid to walk up to the counter and pick a random desert or treat, you will truly experience the coulter and be pleasantly surprised.

Great place with a beautiful atmosphere and great service. Try the silver noodle soup and follow it with some Pad Tai!

All that I wanted was a bacon, egg, cheese and potatoes burrito. I ordered two and placed it in the back seat. I got home and my back seat has grease all over it, I placed it on the hood to clean the car and they leaked all over the roof of my car. I wanted to save it so I wrapped it in a napkin to collect the grease. I had to use 3 napkins to gather the grease. As I ate one the tortilla was so greasy that the burrito was unmanageable. This would be my third bad experience at this location.  On a precious occasion I walked in and waited 5 minutes. I was never greeted nor acknowledged the cook just kept cooking. I would say this place has an issue with customer service and quality. The food is not consistent as the size of the burritos differ from visit to visit. I can be clear in saying that the difference is size highly noticeable.  I've given them several chances and I will now say, this is the last strike.

First the salsa given with chips is really great. As far as the atmosphere its very beautiful and modern with a street art vibe. The food is exceptional, some of the best tacos in town. It's a bit boughie but it works for this place, they come at you with fancy trays for your tacos and they Deliver.
