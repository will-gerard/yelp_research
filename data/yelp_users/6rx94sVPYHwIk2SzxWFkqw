LOVE this restaurant. The food is great (especially the cajun) and great selection of beers! Glad they expanded so there is no more wait, but I love the atmosphere of the original dark cramped restaurant.

Probably my favorite restaurant in all of Arizona. The food is fantastic (I recommend the Cajun Chicken pasty), the servers are really hip and awesome, the kitchen is open for you to see how your food is being made, and the prices are fair. Don't be discouraged if you realize they make the pasties the night before, because they cook them the day of and give you the option to take them home half cooked if you want to eat them at home and cook them yourself. Just such a awesome atmosphere for small groups or a date and really good food with a very nice beer list.

Watermelon Agua Fresca was absolutely delicious and the three tortas we shared at the table did not disappoint! Especially when smothered with the salsa they serve. The food was cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious.   Only reason for the 4 stars is location (way the hell out there in phoenix, wish it was closer!) and atmosphere. The main room is nice with the kitchen visible but the added on room is apparently where the place all the babies and three 20-somethings?   But I definitely recommend this place to anyone!

The interior design of this place is actually really nice, very modern and cute which I can appreciate. But I was very disappointed with the rest of my experience, despite the fact that a lot of my coworkers and friends come here often. The employees were not friendly and rushed me to choose my color. The top coat they use for pedicures is a quick drying nail polish that I buy from target, so I don't feel like it was worth the over pricing they charge. I got a regular manicure and it instantly started to crack when they were finished. I had never experienced this before. I brought this to his attention and he said there was nothing he could do about it. I was pretty disappointed.   The one thing I will say is that if you bring them a picture of a nail design, they will do it to their best ability which is pretty cool, but other than that I do not recommend this place, especially for how expensive it is compared to the quality of service and outcome.

I am very impressed with the service at Greenfield Nails. The prices are definitely fair, in fact, cheaper than they should be! For the standard pedicure it includes a stone massage (which I never had before, and now I love!), different choices for the scented scrub they use, and a really large selection of colors and designs to choose from. They also have a punch card for pedicures so you can get a free one, which is really nice.  I also get gel manicures done here, and I have no complaints. They ask all kinds of questions so you get exactly what you want (do you prefer nail shape round or square, etc) and I haven't had any problem with chipping. They have a crazy amount of color and design choices to choose from and the lady doing my nails told me she wants them to come up with 10 new designs every day so that they have the most options of any salon around.   Most importantly, the employees are all very friendly and welcoming, and seem to have a great relationship with each other (talking about going to happy hour after work together, that's my kind of team!) which I think is very important. They offer you water or mimosas as soon as you walk in, and make sure you don't need anything the whole time you're there, without being annoying. I have had my roommate and mother try this place and they will never go to another place for mani/pedis again.

I live right down the street and this has become our favorite happy hour spot. Great patio, really great atmosphere. Most important, great wine (white on draft!) and the appetizers are delicious. I definitely recommend the bruschetta! Very friendly staff, great service.
