Hillside has been my vet for 8 years since moving from Dallas.  They treat my furry family as one of their own.  I had to put one my dogs to sleep a few years ago (congestive heart failure) and the vet cried with me the entire time.  As did the receptionist.  I just lost another my babies a few weeks ago and the technician Matt made her paw print in plaster for me and put a small red heart in the corner.  He knew I called her my heart that runs around on 4 legs.  The staff at Hillside are really family.  CEW

Spent $400 dollars on the 7 course.  My husband had the wine pairing option with his.  Started off promising but my 2nd course was potato salad.  I didn't put that on foods I hate so my bad but it hardly had any taste except the lettuce was vinegar.  From there down hill.  Every course was bland food with semi fancy presentation.  The desert was good but not exceptional.  All 4 of us at the table (all 4 had the 7 course) were extremely disappointed and had spent a lot of money.  Maybe it was a bad night but their bad night was my expensive birthday dinner.
