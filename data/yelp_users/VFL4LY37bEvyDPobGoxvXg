For some reason, I found this airport to be kind of depressing.  The fact that I arrived here after a red-eye from Phoenix didn't help make it any less depressing.  Compared to other really nice airports I have been to (Phoenix Sky Harbor, LAX, Detroit...), the rugs and chairs and pretty much everything at Charlotte-Douglas International seemed kind of old.  Perhaps it was just the particular terminal I was in (US Airways...never flying with them again, but that's another story), and maybe the rest of the airport isn't quite so bad.  I've only been here once, so I wouldn't know.  But still, it's an airport.  It's meant to be a place to board and disembark from planes.  And it suits that purpose just fine, but I prefer airports that are nice to wander around at during a layover  This one isn't.

I have been in only about six or seven airports, but this one definitely stands out in my memory as being the nicest.  Due to a missed connection, I had to spend a good 11 hours in this airport on standby for a red-eye to Charlotte, NC.  And while spending that much time in an airport is never fun, if it had to happen, I'm glad it happened here.  There are a lot of options for food.  The lighting is bright and cheery (as opposed to the dismal airport we landed at in Charlotte), and there was free wireless internet (always a major plus for me).  And it was clean!  I never thought I would care about the cleanliness of an airport, but once you have to spend half a day in one, it definitely starts to matter.
