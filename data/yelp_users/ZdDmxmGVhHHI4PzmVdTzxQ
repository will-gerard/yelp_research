Boo:(.  My red, white & blue burger was good but I must say the $14 price tag was a tad outrageous.  Not to mention the fact that there is a $3 charge for an upgrade to onion rings when each person at my table had exactly 6 onion rings on their plate!  Yes, that's right 1 burger, with 6 onion rings= $17.00.  Lame!!  This Hardrock is wack in ambiance too!  It is small and boring inside.  The music was barely audible and what I could hear was some terrible pop music that I had never heard before.  The servers must love there job though, the tab suggests a tip of 20%, exactly what you should tip on your $17 burger with 6 onion rings.  The server seemed sweet until she tried twice to upsell us an overpriced dessert.  Save your money and find somewhere else to dine.  Seriously not worth the 30 min wait and messy restroom either!

I enjoyed Sakana very much!  I happened to stumble upon Sakana during happy hour while out searching for a new mom & pop joint to have dinner at on a Sunday evening.  The place was lively and the sushi that kept passing by me looked amazing!  There were some pretty good deals for happy hour including appetizers for 50 cents with the purchase of a Kirin.  We ordered a few rolls including the Miami roll which was one of their special rolls of the evening.  The rolls were ok, standard fancy pants rolls.  I guess for my personal taste with sushi, less is more.....I tend to appreciate the more simple sushi in which the taste of the fish itself really shines.  For this reason, I really enjoyed their yellowtail sashimi above all else.  The presentation of everything was very nice and the sushi chefs made the ambiance very fun and authentic as they took shots with some sushi bar diners.  I would definitely visit Sakana again, especially for their sashimi.

Haji Baba is a top notch middle eastern grocery store and lunch spot!  They offer all of the Mediterranean favorites for a very reasonable price.  Although I have my favorite Mediterranean places for different dishes, I come to Haji Baba when I want a quick, cheap bite.  You can dine in for under $7 and get in and out in less than 30 minutes.    The ambiance is typical of the standard hole-in-the-wall middle eastern eatery.  During lunch time it gets busy, I have seen people waiting for a table to open up.  The wait staff is a loyal bunch that has worked there for years and it is always nice to see their familiar faces.  The hummus is good and the kalamatas are always a delicious treat.  I highly recommend ordering the homemade pita (not on the menu) with your hummus or your pita sandwich....Haji's finest:)  The Greek salad leaves much  to be desired as it consists solely of iceberg with the usual Greek veggies.  Eat here for the sandwiches or plates, not the salads.  In the grocery you can get a variety of inexpensive spices, olive oil, fresh olives, feta and many other tantalizing treats.  And don't forget to try one of the many different types of Baklava that they make as you are checking out!!  My favorite is the almond or the pecan....yummm!

Caffe Boa is a little gem nestled right in of the heart of Tempe on Mill Ave.  I have been going to Caffe Boa since it was in it's original little hole-in-the-wall spot and although the atmosphere is not quite as cozy as it once was, I realize that the move to new, more spacious digs was a necessary evolution of this yummy spot.  The ambiance is diverse with patio, bar or indoor table seating.  Caffe Boa is a bit pricey, but the food and spirits never disappoint.  The separate bar area takes on a life of it's own with it's very animated and cordial staff.  The signature cocktails like the Anastasia, which is a hand-muddled strawberry vodka martini with fresh basil leaves garnishing the top, the blueberry lemon drop, or the fresh red or white sangria are among my favorites.  The wine list is constantly changing with new and exciting additions from around the world and the staff is very knowledgeable on the subtleties of all of the different wines and pairings.  They also offer many unique wine flights for a dabbling into their extensive wine list.  The modestly apportioned appetizers, entrees and desserts are quite delectable and cater to vegetarian and carne lovers alike.  Most of the ingredients and organic produce is obtained from local farmers here in the valley, including their olive oil.  The chicken caesar salad and the bruschetta seems to please all Boa goers.  A few pasta favorites of mine are the agnolotti boa, the pola pola and the butternut squash ravioli.  And for dessert.......I highly recommend the pyramid, chocolate, nuts and hazelnut, yumm.   My friends and family go to Caffe Boa for many occasions, whether we go just for drinks, or for birthday dinners or just to show out-of-towners a good time, it is always an enjoyable experience.  This little spot comes highly recommended, and if you are trying to impress a date......you can rest assure that you will get brownie points for this one:)

So I guess they have now revised their menu with a few new items!  They have now made it a little bit more difficult for the old loyal Boa-goer to discern the old favorites on the menu now that they have done away with the titles of their dishes, thereby forcing one to read the menu thoroughly:)  Although I still am a die hard fan of their classic dishes, I am intrigued with several of the new menu items!  Also, just so you all know Happy hour at Boa includes fabulous deals on their appetizers including the Mussels served in a succulent garlic cream sauce!  Also there are great happy hour deals on wine by the glass.  And don't forget.....Sangria Sundays!  Pitchers of sangria with fruit cut fresh to order is half price on Sundays....both red and white, and both are to-die-for!

Wong's Place is my favorite little family-owned neighborhood Chinese restaurant.  It has the quaint charm that is typical of a hole-in-the-wall Asian dining establishment, complete with the pastel decor reminiscent of the 80's.  The staff is the same loyal, polite staff that has been serving there for years and the service is consistently impeccable.  The staff always greets us with a familiar smile, the food is always delicious, my glass is always full, and the prices are very modest.  Although I have had many of their entrees, a few come to mind as the standalone, "must have" dishes to recommend above all others.  The Seafood Hot & Sour Soup is by far the most delectable option on the menu!  It is far different than the standard hot & sour fare and is filled with mussels, shrimp & squid, green onions and mushrooms in a spicy red broth.....it makes my mouth water with delight when I think of it!  Everyone that tries it keeps coming back for it, no matter how far the drive!  A few other faves are the Wong Jo Chicken with black mushrooms and ginger and the Pork Fried Rice.  If you have a large party to entertain, Wong's offers a special dinner price that is all inclusive and large family-style tables so that  everyone can share.  It is not uncommon for the place to be packed with families at dinner time on the weekends.  If it is fine dining or gourmet Chinese ambiance that you are looking for, you won't find it here, BUT....I highly recommend Wong's if you are looking for a delicious neighborhood fare for a great price.

I have visited Yupha's Thai Kitchen once for lunch and once for dinner.  Let it be known that they close for a short period between lunch and dinner so you have to make it before 3pm for lunch or after 5pm for dinner.  The lunch was very nice although the lunch menu had somewhat limited options in comparison to the numerous dinner menu offerings.  The lunch menu offered the most popular Thai fare for an average lunch price.  During their lunch hours, Yuhpa's offers a little soup and salad bar at which you can make your own little Thai salad and/or soup.  Although soup and salad bar is very basic, I was impressed with sweet and rich peanut dressing and the ornately cut cucumbers.  The ambiance was pleasant with it's contemporary decor and high ceilings.  My dinner visit was much more exciting as the dinner menu was far more extensive with some unique Thai dishes such as the Thai Jerky with Papaya salad.....both delicious, I might add!  The curry was very good also.  The presentation of everything was lovely as well.  I also noticed upon leaving that they have a live Jazz band that plays on certain nights, something that I will surely be back to check out.  Indeed I have many dishes to try before I add Yupha's to my list of favorite Thai restaurants, but it has definitely caught the attention of my taste buds for my future Tempe Thai cravings!

First and foremost, I LOVE mexican food!  I eat it at least once or twice a week.  I have had the pleasure of enjoying many home-cooked mexican dishes with my mexicano friends and I have traveled deep into the heart of Mexico experiencing many different flavors and styles of mexican food.  My love affair with mexican food is well-developed.  To be quite frank, the food at Amado's is BLAND for the norte√±o style.  Especially when compared to Filiberto's, which probably explains the usual Amados crowd.  This place is always packed with drunk highschool and ASU jocks every Friday and Saturday night, complete with the occasional highschool spar that draws police.  So the late night bar crowd should beware, this place is a night in jail waiting to happen.  This is why they have security cameras aimed right at you as you order.  The best thing going for this place is the little salsa bar.  I am staying loyal to the near by Filiberto's which is much more relaxed, more flavorful and has a drive-thru.

Excellent Thai!  This place is a small family owned and run little hole-in-the-wall and it is truly delicious!  The family is very cordial and the ambiance is very quaint and relaxing.  I had the Curry Puffs and the Crying Tiger Beef salad.  I can honestly say that of all of the Thai places that I have been to--and there have been many--their beef salad puts all of the others to shame.  It is filled with mounds of fresh, whole mint leaves, red onion, perfectly cooked beef in thin slices, and a lovely tangy dressing.  The curry puffs were little like little dried mini pastys with a yummy curry filling served with a refreshing red onion, chili and cucumber salad.  My boyfriend had the yellow curry with tofu, prepared spicy, and the tofu was cooked with precision.  To cool the heat, we enjoyed a tall glass of Thai iced tea.  I highly recommend this place above all other Thai places in the east valley.  I also love to support small business owners that take pride in their work just as this family does.  So I hope you give this place a shot and enjoy their delicious delights as much as I have!  If u go, check out the cute little Thai gifts when u walk in.  The Thai dolls are darling.

My visit to True Food was lovely.  As I approached the entrance one of the employees was picking fresh basil from the front herb-garden-flower-box thing, and as my friends and I entered I saw the open kitchen area where people were cutting up fresh carrots and other veggies.  The feeling of freshness was all around me with the hustle and bustle of the open kitchen, the easy, breezy, yoga-like attire of the staff, the high ceilings and the open windows.  Our waiter explained the restaurant concept and told us about the menu as well as Dr. Weil's philosophy for food and health.   I decided to try their specialty drink, the cucumber refresher, out of curiosity.  It was a cool refreshing glass of cucumber and honey lemonade.  My friends and I decided to share the hummus as an appetizer.  The hummus was delicious, although I would not dare to compare it to any authentic hummus/ pita plates.  The amount of pita served with it was a bit insufficient for the amount of hummus.  However, there was no problem getting more pita, the waiter graciously brought us more for no additional charge.   For my lunch entree, I ordered the sashimi tuna salad with avocado, cucumber, tomato, edamame & ginger, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  It was very light and fresh, as it sounds like it should be:)  The flavor of the ginger complemented the salad perfectly and the dressing did not over power the other flavors and textures.  My friends both seemed to enjoy their meals as well.  I left feeling good and ready to return soon.    And return soon I did, this time with my boyfriend in tow.  He eats a low glucose index diet and I was excited to take him to True Food because the food seemed so clean.  When we arrived this time the service was very similar to my first experience but as we spoke with the waiter and my boyfriend explained the low G.I. diet, the waiter seemed unfamiliar with this concept.  We asked him for some recommendations and he suggested the harvest chopped salad for him.  I ordered the wild ahi sliders with wasabi, radishes, cucumber on pumpernickel.  The sliders were fabulous!  They were flavorful, perfectly seasoned with the wasabi, and seared to near perfection.  My boyfriend's salad on the other hand, was less satisfactory.  For one, the waiter didn't really understand the low glucose diet when he recommended the salad, which was a lot like a Waldorf salad, containing sugary fruits and such.  Secondly, the salad was soaked with dressing, unlike the perfectly balanced sashimi salad that I had enjoyed there a week or so before.  The salad was so wet that the greens were lost in there!  I was very sad because I had such high hopes for his first True Food experience.  I would still recommend True Food because overall my experience was good, but perhaps next time we will order our salads with the dressing on the side......eeep!

This is one of my favorite south Tempe haunts of late!  It has a relaxed feel, and a far more spacious dining area than the other Tempe location.  The Pasty is a unique little pocket of delight!  Originating as traditional miner's fare in Cornwall, England, the Pasty has now evolved into many new and interesting, nontraditional Pasties upon it's arrival to Tempe, AZ.  Although the more traditional Shepard's pie with red wine gravy is my favorite flavor, there is now a Royal with Cheese, a Chicken Tikka Masala, and many more fun-filled pasties to try!  For those of you that have had a Pasty in England, this will not be what you are expecting because the Pasty here is much larger.  There are no side items served with it and you should expect it to be a just little smaller than a calzone.  Go without the expectation for traditional English fare and the Pasty will not disappoint!  Aside from the yummy pasties, the setting of The Cornish Pasty is cozy and fun.  The Jukebox there is awesome....playing everything, classic rock, psychedelic, new wave, etc.  At night, the lights grow dim and each table is candle lit.  They have a large patio that is currently being remodeled and a long indoor bar that overlooks the cooks prepping delicious pasties.  The staff is a charming and scenic tattooed hipster crowd that make the place seem young and alluring and there are nearly always bikes parked outside and pints being poured.  They serve a nice assortment of beer in a nice array of sizes.  I love the Pasty and I love to recommend it because it is unique and just plain delicious!  If you haven't had a pasty yet, you should!!
