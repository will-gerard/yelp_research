We dined in for lunch on a Friday.  Short wait and then we were seated in bar area.  Took about 15 minutes to get our drinks because our waiter was also bartender. It looked like a busted up antique shop but i guess that's what they are going for.  Garlic bread and complementary bread were pretty good.  I ordered a salad that was drenched in oil. Very hard to eat more than a couple bites.  Chicken in my pasta was definitely frozen and looked like rubber.  I'm glad i tried it but i won't come back.  Much better value at  olive garden

Great customer service...lots of concession choices that are somewhat reasonable.  Parking and getting out of downtown was a disaster and that was the only downfall

What an upgrade from the roadhouse in tempe. Waitstaff was on point until they forgot to bring out my salad. Ate that with my meal. Other than that we did not have to ask for refills on drinks or hot buns. It was so pleasant. Waitress waited on us just enough. Food cooked perfectly and big ol portions. We will choose this location moving forward

This place was pretty entertaining!! The music varied from star wars to frozen theme songs. Pizza was alright, but crust not very good.  For two people it would be about $15 for a medium two topping pizza. Drinks are a bit pricey so I'll stick with water. Looking forward to going back

Beyond dissapointed. From the reviews and $ sign i thought it would be affordable. We walked in and a lot of the decor is dirty, broken, and the seats were ripped.  Not only that but the floors were very grimy. We started with soda and opened the menu. I was so ready to walk out.  Burgers were 10.49 and up.  The only one under $10 was without cheese. The appetizers were over 7.00 from what i saw and the soups were over $4.00. I didn't want to be embarrassed so we stayed.  The waitress was great though. Very friendly and refilled our drinks without us having to ask.  Food came out and the burger was huge. It had a good taste as well.  You get your choice of cheese and i asked for cheddar.  I was pretty surprised when i had a small amount of somewhat melted shredded cheddar cheese.  I know cheddar slices are expensive but jeeze it was pretty bad. For that price i can't believe they just put a table spoon of shredded cheese on it.

Dinner on Valentines day. I can say that we waited an awful long time for a table even after we did call ahead. When we finally were seated i was surprised that our tablecoth was full of crumbs from the last people. How romantic.  Waiter was somewhat pompous and was not friendly.  We had to ask him for the complimentary bread.  Food was alright And mashed potatos were worth the upcharge.

Really liked the lanes here.  Very modern and have music videos blasted across alley. The music choice was very pg considering it was mostly adults in there.  The price was extremely high for two people and two games of bowling.  I reccomend going on a Tuesday or Sunday night after 6 when they have specials

Just got home and I'm furious. I went to a different walmart earlier in the day but they were out of the two things i needed. Frustrated i just left and said id come to the one closer to home. So i knew itd be busy at this time of night but i really needed the list of things i had.  I grabbed a handful of things and then head over to cosmetics shortly after 10pm on a Saturday.  Now i know this location has a huge theft issue (they dont have greeters, they have security guards) but the cosmetics dept was totally blocked off!!! As if it were not bad enough that they make u pay separate for cosmetics they close it off completly. They clearly dont give two shits about accommodating a customers needs and cant afford an employee to cover cosmetics. You can't even trust your customers?? No other walmarts in the area have their cosmetics on lockdown and if you do then post hours of operation by ur damn pharmacy hours if you dont offer those services past a certain time. By the way i tossed my handful of junk on ur endcap so someone else can put away. I wont buy anything from you unless its a last resort. Id rather pay $2 more at target than be treated like a criminal

Extremely over priced.  Came in for late night and requested a booth.  Everyone must request them because there wanst one available but yet the tables were empty.  They were filled with dishes to be bussed.  The staff didn't seem to have much ambition to clean em.    Ordered drinks and we were shocked when we were charged $10 for a tiny margarita.  What a rip. Ordered half off apps menu .You couldn't order more than one per person. I felt like there were a lot of restrictions for the late night menu.   Food was good, service was ok. Got the bill and our waiter didn't even stay thank you or have good night.  Kind of an awkward way to end the experience. Total bill for a couple appetizers and two drinks was $65  I did notice that there were employees sitting around at bar and in corner for the whole time we dined.  Considering how over staffed they were you think the tables might be cleaned off.  Also it's a bit unpleasant hearing  the waitstaff complain about their tips.

Stopped in on a Friday with my man.  Was helped by a friendly gentleman who explained everything i needed to know.  I had a blast shooting at the targets! Ladies shoot free Friday's but still a bit pricey (however is one of the most reasonable prices in area) While i was waiting my turn to shoot, a young teen was pointing her gun to the side. Immediately a staff member alerted her and told her to turn around.  I appreciated their attentiveness!

Loved it! Great for families.  We enjoyed the large portions and live music while dining. The menu doesn't have many options, but had some good stuff to choose from.. They have a nice salad bar too. Waiter was pleasant and attentive. We enjoyed the 10 minute gun show, its free for the young bucks and $5 for adults.

Wonderfully clean and organized. Seats are spacious. They offer value items that include hot dogs and sodas under $2.  We paid for reserved parking and got the worst spot possible but the walk to stadium is simple and short. Cant wait to go again

Met the hype! I really enjoyed strolling around and feeding the fishies. The koi food is only $1 and it goes a long way.  It's a little sanctuary in the city. Very quiet and relaxing.  Bring ur camera lots of photo opps

They amaze me! They get those orders right even when they are crazy busy.  Reasonable prices, but very limited seating. Had to wait for spot.  I noticed there were employees refilling ice wiping down counters and keeping things clean considering how busy they were.   Great food!!!

Blown away by my experience tonight.  So i booked online through priceline and after i presented my az driver license i was asked to provide proof of insurance.  My mother from out of state didn't have to show insurance a few weeks ago so i was confused. I showed him my policy number and payment receipts but he wanted the dates of policy. .. um what does that matter? people have coverage start and end dates it doesn't mean that  they actually pay and are covered. After saying " if u can't show me I'm NOT renting you the car" i said,  whatever what do i do  if i choose to cancel he said" here you go, go to Fox your done here" and SLAPPED my card and license on counter.  He cancelled my reservation because i stepped out of line to scour my emails and when i found policy dates he said " Ur already voided i cancelled your reservation" thanks for ruining my holiday weekend. He knew we needed that car to go up north.  No wonder your the only company with "cars available" On labor day weekend you suck!!!!!!   On a side note -- my mother rented a car a few weeks ago and it had filthy stained seats, broken window, and broke visor that hung down obstructing the windshield. We had to take 15 pics for proof that we got the car in that condition.

Went for an early breakfast with some friends. Waitress was pleasant and was so sweet replenishing our creamer as needed. Food was great and would reccomend the VIB. it has an endless selection of sides and main dishes to choose from. Cost was about $11 with tip.

Love this place. The owner, mr pollack is amazing for offering such great prices.  I purchased the loyalty cup and think that is a great $$ saver.  Parking isnt the best on Tuesday or weekends its very packed. So plan a bit you may have to circle the lot twice. The seats are not the most comfortable in a couple of the theaters but oh well. They have a lot of great movie selections for all ages

Total rip off. $30.59 for lunch.  All we got were two burgers, fries, and sodas.   Cons:  The booth was small and dirty (especially jukebox), ketchup nearly empty,  no napkins.    They brought our fries out early to give us something to much on, but no napkins.    Burger  was so greasy my plate had a puddle of grease   Slow service,  mediocre waitress, very loud, no music or dancing  Pros:  Fries were pretty good and its nice that they offer unlimited,  but why would u pay $12.89 for burger and fries????  Location

What a wonderful destination. They offer a path for biking,running, and also picnic tables. It's a great little spot to relax for the afternoon. There was even a guy fishing(didn't see him catch anything tho). When i go back I'll bring a blanket and just chill there. Its an oasis in the middle of the city.  Also they have garbage cans few and far between but they are there.  Visitors definitely need to make an effort to clean up after themselves. So much trash by ducks, very disappointing.

So glad we were bored and took a drive tonight. It was a beautiful little area by the water tower with tables and other various seating. They had fountains and other things to catch your eyes. Perfect spot to enjoy a coffee or soda with company.

Stopped in just to check it out since it's been years since I've been to one. The first thing i noticed was the unkept buffet.  Dirty bowls sitting there, sauce all over, dirty seats etc. While paying at cashier i noticed they kept pizzas under The buffet counter un covered. My guess is that those are to replenish The buffet.  They were nearly touching the ground!    The salad was good,  pasta was ok,  and pizza was pretty tasteless. There was a couple waiting for a pizza they special ordered but it never came out and when they asked manager they said they didn't know when it would be ready  so they left.  I would recommend coming here only if it's the last place open or if u are absolutly craving a buffet.

Beautiful park with lots to offer.  Basketball courts, batting cages,  fishing,  and a lake with a trail. It's really relaxing to come down on a weekend morning.

Extremely nice service!  Greeted promptly and order went smoothly.  Food was great especially the fries. I wish they had more condiments for fries (ranch, cheese, mayo) since they give you so many.   Why i love it here : **You can share a large fry between 2-4 people!  **unlimited toppings on burger!   Restaurant could have been cleaner. Or table was kinda greasy

This place pleasantly surprised me! It reminds me of a spot from my hometown and has a greek style menu. My mom had the gyro burger and i got a bite.  It was so good! I had the patty melt and it was very good.  I wish they would serve a cup of soup with the meal like other diners do but the portion of fries is enough to fill you up.  Prices are $8-$9 a person. Service coulda been faster but it was worth the slow waiter

So for my  first time here, i had a good experience.  Order came out fast and good looked great.  Cane sauce hit the spot and was nice and peppery. Chicken was moist and fries were superb. I wish texas toast was a little more buttery. Soda machines seemed to be running out of syrup, soda was kinda watery and tasteless. Im excited to go back again!!

For $5 you can't go wrong.  It actually tastes like real pizza unlike little ceasars for example.  The flavored crusts are a nice feature to add to any pizza. I will be back and hopefully will be hungry enough to try the fries

Love the reclining seats. Parking was a drag. I gotta say i had no idea this was in the middle of mill and i was a bit surprised.  It was flooded with college kids which is great, but not my scene. I really liked that they have refill stations upstairs on the 2nd floor. Also elevators and escalators.  I did order two hotdogs for my date but they said it would be 20 mins until they were cooked. Lol obviously we skipped the dogs but I'm curious how they are ok with losing $10 that easily.

Very overpriced if you get a combo meal.  It was $20 for myself and my mom. On the other hand it was really yummy.  I had a chicken bacon ranch. This was my first time here and i had no idea how to order.  You are able to add various goodies like pickles..peppers for no extra charge. The customer service was great

I think this place is so awesome!!! It's so different and exciting. We were seated inside and got an extremely comfortable leather booth.  I do wish we would have been seated outside but maybe next time.  We ordered the pretzels and fondue and it was awesome!  Huge portion and worth the $10. Also tried pulled pork nachos and the chips were bomb!    Burgers and fries were good too but next time I'll try another burger.  Mine tasted too similar to big mac.   Service was great.  Waiter was attentive and gave us to go beverages.  Very courteous.

Stopped in on a Saturday evening and the place was pretty full. A couple entered the same time as us and were sat and greeted with chips and drinks. After we sat,  we were kinda looking around wondering why nobody was greeting us. Two more couples came in and were given chips before us. I told my boyfriend that if they didnt come over in two minutes we were leaving.  All of sudden they greeted us so we were stuck.  We ordered an appetizer and waited  for it to arrive while everyone who came in AFTER us was finishing their entree and waiting for their bill.  We were beyond frustrated. The appetizer was nothing but thick melted cheese on a skillet. We thought it would be more of a thick dip.  After everyone else left we got our  food.  The people that came in 20 minutes after us got their food two minutes after us.   I asked for sour cream with my order and when i got my plate there wasnt any. Considering they Charge $1 ud think they'd remember that.  Portions were kind of small. my burrito was soggy and i couldn't eat the ends becuz they were so doughy.   The reason we came here was becuz the pollack cinema had an ad that u could get $2 off per entree with ticket.  I tried to use and girl said it has to be used the same day as ur movie. The ad at  the movie does not say that. Total bait and switch. Like perfect definition of it. Girl heard me complain and came back saying she would take it. I told her it was ok and not to worry about it (Becuz another table was staring at me and i didnt wanna seem cheap or like a baby.)   We had three different people wait on us so maybe that had something to do with our poor experience

Horrible seating arrangements with really  uncomfortable chairs. Too loud you can't even speak to those you're with. There's  lots of open space in there it almost seems incomplete.
