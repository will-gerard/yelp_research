My 3 children and I had the pleasure of taking this tour with Tim and a great Aussie family. This otherwise long 4 hour ride was fun and entertaining. Tim kept us interested by providing us with tons of facts about AZ and joking with us the whole way.  We stopped for lunch at the Indian Reservation and did some light shopping.  The Grand Canyon was spectacular and Tim was so accommodating taking our pictures along the way.   Tim was the highlight of the trip.  He provided the visiting Australian family with tips on visiting Sedona and showed us some great things along the way.  He had a supply of water he kept encouraging us to drink. My daughter left our camera in the car and he graciously returned it that very night.  Thanks Tim and SouthWest for providing us with a great experience.

This was fun.  Originally we wanted to do the T-bone Steak ride but the cowboy on hand took one look at these city slickers and gracefully convinced us to do the shorter trail rides instead.  I am so glad he did.  Prices were great, staff was great.  Overall a fun time.

Oh I forgot how much I hate you!   You've  yet again managed to ruin another family vacation! I promised myself the last time that I would never fly you again.  But somehow I forgot.   Delayed due to a malfunctioning generator?? Really and now you want me to go 5 hours cross country on you with my offspring! I will never ever fly you again.  Missing the AZ diamondback game was the least of my worries.  Thinking that I was flying on an old decrepit plane....yeah pretty much occupied my mind.  Your staff is rude.  You didn't even offer us a FREE snack after delaying us for 3 hours.    You made me want to write Jet Blue a love letter, asking for forgiveness because I cheated with a lesser quality airline.  I will never fly you again and OH I won't forget!!

We went on a TravelZoo coupon and were treated royally.  I had been here several years ago and remember the amazing massage I received.  Tammi was my masseuse  this time around and she did an amazing job.  I love the Eucalyptus room and the waterfall massage.  The spa lunch was tasty and felt so fresh and healthy.  The service was good, the spa was clean and the cabana rooftop pool was the icing on the cake.

I'm writing this review a little late as we visited in the last week of June.  I will try to remember the details.   Environment: Beautiful Service:  Excellent Mojitos:  Awesome  Food:  Great  The in depth talk in the lobby with the resident artist:  Priceless.

I was fully prepared to give this place five stars.  I even got caught up in the hype and purchased a timeshare here.    I bedroom villa with golf course view....beautiful. Heavenly bed and pillows....heavenly. Shuttle bus that comes quickly and takes you to nearby locations....excellent.  Paying a prepay rate ahead of time only to be given a bill with crazy resort fees and incidental charges...Awful.

I love Richard Sandoval restaurants.  Maya and Pampano in NYC are two of my favorites.  So when in AZ I had to try out La Hacienda.  One look at the happy hour menu and I was in love!  The best El Diablo Margarita for $5.00!  Prickly Pear Margarita $5.00.  A whole assortment of tacos $5.00!  Ceviche was awesome.  Guacamole amazing!

We were delight to see chorizo on the menu.  They had a varied menu with many breakfast options.  My daughter's had the run for the border platter and really enjoyed it.  I had a breakfast burrito with chorizo as did my son.  Everything came out quickly and the staff was pleasant.
