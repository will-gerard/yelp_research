moved into these apartments a few months ago and I have to say that it's been an awesome experience so far.  really nice pool, clean, and dog friendly.  There is also a nice gym with newer equipment attached to a community room that can be used by anyone.    it's located right on the bike path near a fresh and easy within walking distance.  everything can be done online including the maintenance requests which is pretty convenient.    only thing I think can be improved would be a little bit bigger gym but other than that it's perfect.  I would recommend this place to anyone

I would have given this place less than one star if I could.  Went to get a standard oil change.  They tried to cross sell me with 10 other completely unnecessary "recommendations."  When I told them all I wanted was the oil change the service guy almost became upset with me.  To top it off they then try to charge me $75 for the oil change itself.  I was furious and demanded the so called manager to lower the price.  After about a 20 minute argument he then offers me $25 off the total and $10 off the next visit.  DO NOT GO HERE HORRIBLE SERVICE AND PRICE

Being from Chicago and a Blackhawks fan I decided to stop by this bar with my girlfriend to watch game 5 of the Stanley cup final.  We get to the front and there is maybe one other couple standing around.  Normally when going to bars in the Scottsdale area your greeted by a bouncer not a hostess, but I figured hey what the heck.  So as we approach the hostess the first thing she says to us is sorry there's a 2 and a half hour wait to get in.  We say 2 and a half hours ? well unfortunately we would have missed the game if we wanted to wait that long.  Supposedly her reasoning was because the bar area was too full ?  Never heard of such a thing in Scottsdale considering I've lived here for the last 5 years.  Looking in there was clearly enough room for at least another 50-75 people in the bar area.  Not only that but her tone when saying that was very rude and condescending.  I'm thinking to myself you know your not the only bar with the Blackhawks game right ? Lol  We took our business to bottled blondes where the service was top notch and people understand the concept of customer service and customer retention.  Very disappointed after hearing this was a Blackhawks bar.  Will never go here again.  I'll post a video to show you how "full" it was inside.
