Don't count out the younger brother! Although they don't brew their own bear at this location, it still taste just as fresh as Tempe. Now Tempe's location is the shit, but the reason why I like this one better is because it isn't as busy! The happy hour is still the same awesome prices, just with less commotion. The atmosphere is a lot more laid back and staff is friendly,. Favorite beet: Oatmeal Stout Favorite appetizer: Spicey Thai Hummus and beef nachos!

As of right now under renovation. This place is awesome! Breakfast burrito is my favorite. Everything seems to taste a bit better around 2:00am

Well, I hate reviewers that leave a  back story before every post... but I must say being from New York this is the closest to N.Y. style pizza you will ever get living in Arizona.   That being said...  This place not only taste delicious but it has great specials... all freaking day. I usually get special c. A 1 topping pizza and 6 wings ... extra crispy always.

GREAT SALON! I was looking for a fresh new haircut and one the the stylist, Tyler Colman, helped me out with the exact look I was going for. Ask for Tyler, he is a super hip guy that knows about the latest styles and is very experienced.

Where do I start? I used to live on dobson and 8th ave and go to the street every day. The coolest/sweetest Korean lady owns it. The boba is amazing whether you get the tea, smoothy, or slush. Try the   (red bean ice) fresh fruit. This place is 5* hands down. Plus... You get to draw on the wall....

OSHA is def one of the better Thai restaurants in Scottsdale. The Thai iced tea is the best I've had since my friends aunt made it from scratch.

I just hung up from one of the most disturbing customer service situations I've ever been in. After being kept on hold for what felt like forever -- in 105 degree heat! -- my call was answered by a woman who seemed disinterested in helping me from the second she picked up.  After hurrying me through the phone call and peppering me with questions, she asked for an exact street address (even after asking for the the main cross streets), which I had to look up for her. While still on the phone - she turned away from the receiver and said -- to someone I can only imagine was a coworker -- "I wish these people that called us were prepared."   Well receptionist lady, I wish - that I wasn't left on hold in 105 degree heat. I wish - that my clutch didn't blow out.  I wish - that I didn't have to spend 10 minutes on the phone with someone like you. I wish - that you had a little more patience for me to fish out the business card of my shop just like I had while I was waiting for you just to take me off hold. I wish - that I don't have to use your services... oh wait that wish came true. Before I called Tow 4 Less I called 4 other tow companies who actually respected my time and had reasonable rates.  My suggestion is to shop around, there are other tow companies out there.

really hip coffee joint with cool music. Vintage yet modern I think it's a hispers dream. Coffee is fresh and the staff is friendly. The location of sola is right in the middle of the creepy part of old town scottsdale, but don't let that detour you from visiting. It is also a great place to just sit and surf the we with their free wifi.

Great  professional guys who know what they are doing! They really take the time to help you learn what they want to do and why they want to do it. Best Euro performance shop in Arizona for sure. Tuning gruppe son!

This shop isn't about just selling bikes, it is about the culture around bmx. The owner is a long time rider himself and personally text the time to find out about the customer. Personally, I am a new rider who came to serenity in search of my first bike. Tyler spent the time with me and find tuned the bike to my riding style. I felt comfortable to have someone who was so passionate about this sport take the time to show me what I wanted to learn. Even if your not in to bmx you should def check out the shop. The clothing selection is amazing so many different styles and choices. Everything from art to fashion to riding this is a one stop shop. the sign on the door says culture boutique and that is exactly what it is!

Not a great selection on parts. Have to ask to get helped. I was the only person in there when I asked three sales associates for help. They pointed to where they thought the product was and never offered assistance. Thank you  my experience was at the fountain hills location... pick it up fh... pick it up
