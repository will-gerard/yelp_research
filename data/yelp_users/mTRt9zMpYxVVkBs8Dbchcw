The food is ok. Definitely not worth the wait though. We sat here for nearly an hour while the restaurant emptied out, being told that the manager said no one could be seated yet.

It's a Subway... The staff is personable and offers good suggestions. Everything seems as fresh as it can get at a subway.

Great desserts. Less sweet than my bachelor american pallet is used to... But that made the desert feel less guilty while still tasting fresh and delicious!  I will be stopping by again .

This is the best Indian food I've had. My tastes are pretty basic, I'm not into risky food, and this stuff tasted great from the first bite! Also, my wife and I judge authenticity of foreign food by the number of people from that country that eat there... you see lots of people from India eating here, with just their hands and all sometimes!

Great food. I am into "man-food" such as un-healthy bar food like, pizza, wings, and burgers. My wife is from China and loves authentic Asian cuisine; Noodles Ranch satisfies both of us for sure!

Get v6 and add some spicy sauce if you like it that way.

Not bad food. Environment feels dirty though.
