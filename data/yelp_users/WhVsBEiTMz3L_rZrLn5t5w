I've only been in an Autozone a handful of times, but this location exceeded my expectations last night. I started a hectic day with a dead battery and had to call friends to save me with jumper cables (I'm going to insist my future kids own & know how to use jumper cables because I don't have the foggiest idea how to do so!!).   Miguel tested my battery. When the results came back positive for a working battery, he made a suggestion to troubleshoot for alternator issues. He asked if I had 30 minutes to drive around. He said if the battery increases in percentage after driving around, my alternator is okay as well! I told him I'd do anything to find out the issue. So, I set about driving around looking at Christmas lights to get the job done.  Thirty minutes later and an additional test and VOILA! I'm in the clear. We solved the issue. They gave me some hints to make sure it doesn't happen again. Nice, helpful AND knowledgeable--the trifecta in auto store customer service!!   Ps. They cannot change the battery on a BMW, but they will do what it takes to tell you what is going on with any car issue. I was fine with that--

it's a great park for being in the middle of the desert. Bring your dog for some afternoon play time or bring your kids for a game of pick-up basketball, soccer practice with the nets or just to get some energy out at the playground. Bring a book if you are in the mood to relax, but I do not suggest coming to do so in the heat of the day. As a matter of fact, it's the perfect spot to be at dusk--with great views of Camelback mountain. There is also fishing (although what in the world to people catch in that pond!?) and sand volleyball courts.   Bring a friend and walk the loop--great for walkers, runners, rollerbladers or strollers. It is also nice because I can walk to this park and take a casual stroll around the loop without getting knocked over by the fitness crew!  The grass and the fitness circuits along the loop are not as well-kept as I am used to, but it a clean park and it is full of great people trying to enjoy the outdoors.   I like to bring a book and sit at dusk on one of the benches and watch the sun disappear over the mountain.

This review is for the wifi and for the general expectation that No matter where you go in this country, you can ALWAYS count on Starbucks for wifi when you need. NOT HERE! If you are looking for a lovely patio space to work on, they have a great space, but the wifi is unreliable, IF you can even get on to the connection!   I work a block away, for a non-ASU entity. I specifically came to this location, with work in tow, today. I was looking forward to the opportunity to get some work done on their gorgeous outdoor space. You see, I had one meeting early this morning, and another late afternoon. I thought this Starbucks would be a great place to get stuff done. I should have gone to Lola or Desoto Public Market.    never write negative reviews, but the wifi is AWFUL! It is the ASU guest network, not the typical Google Starbucks wifi. I think Starbucks opted for this system because they counted on the ASU wifi being stellar, and reliable, for their patrons. That is NOT the case.  I'm so disappointed because the outside space is SO lovely. I even purchased a Starbucks drink, today--something I never do anymore because I enjoy some  of our great local coffee shop coffee.   The frustration lies not in an ill-working wifi, but rather that you could always count on Starbucks for a wifi connection. That magical green logo symbolized a coffee standard, snacks you can count on in a pinch AND wifi! Until, today!

This is the cleanest, most organized and friendliest Goodwill I have ever visited. Like other helpers, I hate to even give a good review because I don't want it to become inundated with those also looking for spectacular used goods.   The book selection here is astounding. It is organized and has quite a few genres--everything from cooking to baby to astronomy and garden. The fiction section is vast! I even found a few books that were currently listed on the NYT Bestseller list, in perfect condition.   The holiday selection here is also very fun to peruse. So much Christmas and Halloween goodness to find. I was pleasantly surprised.   And, the staff was friendly. At a Goodwill!!! Imagine that-- I have found the opposite to be true at most Goodwill stores that I have frequented.   Love this place. Hats off to the location for a stellar store (clean AND organized!!!) and a super friendly staff.
