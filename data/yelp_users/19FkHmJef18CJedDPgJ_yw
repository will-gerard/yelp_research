I was headed out to Pita on 3rd Ave and got roped into going here by a group that said - "it's great and in Park Central"...all I'm gonna say is that it was like cafeteria food. Yeah, like cafeteria food - cold pizza and overly dressinged salad

Oddly enough I only came to this location after visiting the new Gilbert location. Have to say I think I like the Gilbert locale better and I'm almost a little sick hearing myself say that. Not sure what was up with the rap music on this visit as I am in love with the music at the other locations. Not a great fan of the valet either as they don't seem to know how to dive manual cars or operate emergency  brakes.   So, I'm giving this location 4 stars based on the whole concept and the food (and assuming it will be better next time) but in my heart it gets 3 stars.

This is still my all time favorite sushi place....atmosphere is strip mall blah but the price and sushi is fabulous.  Their baked scallops or langostino's are fabulous. Their Vegas roll is deep fried and though not as refined as Ra's version still very satisfying. Sashimi portions are large and fresh. I also recommend the escolar...slightly grilled with a sauce. Salmon dynamite is good as well. Always something new, though the "crab with a K" in everything is a little disappointing but it's usually out shined by great toppings.   The miso soup and iced green tea are good and you can't go wrong with a sake-bomber!!

Never in a gazillion years would I expect to take people to a Roy's and have a bad food experience - pigs are flying.  I took some employees and their spouses out for a year end thank-you dinner. While the lobster potstickers and spicy tuna appetizers were great, that's where the good part of the meal ended. My butterfish, usually mouth watering yumminess was so-so and served with white rice. Other dishes at the table like the swordfish and petite filet were dry and flavorless. I'd prefer not to delve more into the embarassment that was this dining experience....needless to say I have since eaten at the Chandler Roy's and had my faith restored - but I pressed my luck at the JW location and pulled up a big Whammy.

I ate here for a business meeting - I knew it was a nice restaurant but am ashamed to admit I did not know it was a AAA 5-diamond. I was a little taken aback but the decor is so simple so you would never know it when walking it.   What you immediately notice is the service and attention to detail. The hand-painted menus, Pima language in your introduction, and courses representing life's journey. They had me at "would you like a slice of key lime, cucumber, lemon, tangerine, cucumber...for your water?" ....now that's attention to detail.   The chef sent out a special amuse bouche of buffalo tartar - I don't remember .I had the heirloom tomato, goat cheese & marscapone tart - it was the size of a muffin tin but I could have eaten a pie plate full. It was a delightful layering of sweet, creamy and tangy and the "black ice" was black gold - sprinkled ice crystals of reduced balsamic magic.   Another special chef treat was a palate cleanser of pomegranate and pepper sorbet served in a small metal bird's nest like dish. I skipped the rest of the journey and went straight for the buffalo tenderloin. I have never had buffalo like this...buttery medium-rare with local flavors of saguaro blossom and cholla buds.   Coffee was served tableside in individual French presses - my favorite. (Maybe I'm not such a country girl after all)  3 hour dinner, too bad I didn't valet park and get the thank you gifts mentioned in other reviews!  Most people probably can't get over the price - it was amusing to see different guests (ages, socioeconomic status, etc.) and their attitudes toward the experience.  All dress seems to be welcome - I had to laugh because there was a couple that totally looked like the Carl's Jr .steak sandwich commercial - she's in a bright blue spandex dress and he's in campshirt  and shorts....Arizona is casual but have some respect.   My country upbringing and lack of exquisite dining experience was growing uneasy with the constant service, being called Ms. all night long, etc. but I slipped into the luxury quite easily...life is good, exceptional food is bliss and Kai should be a goal for everyone to splurge on.

Not sure what has happened but the prices are higher and the quality is poor (stay away from the shrimp!).   No real witty way to say it...they are off my Thai list forever. Good thing there are a plethora of uberfab places in the Chandler area!

I don't even know where to begin....which is ironic because it was hard to find this typical east valley type bar-in-a-strip-mall. I really wasn't sure what to make of the place with the crabby face on the door.  There are couple different areas to the place and when packed I could see it having a college house party charm. But empty, you just get the smell of fried food and punching while watching younger folks who think they got dressed up to go to Scottsdale but instead ended up in a Gilbert strip mall. I was here to listen to some accoustic sets - not the best  venue for that. Distracted by the TVs, Golden Tee video screen, and a real punching bag game machine (as macho as it gets boys)...So I had one drink, one drink only ($6.50 for Jameson's...really Toby?!?!) and am still perplexed at what this place is trying to be and why they would let people punch a bag during an accoustic music set. Big patio outside, big room inside with a stage and punching machine, and a smaller room for darts and pool. It was kind of like the place I worked back in Iowa that had a buffet, bowling alley, roller rink and minigolf. you can't be all things to all people...but maybe in Gilbert that's a possibility.

The rating may be a little toney for hole in the wall flea market meets iquor store....but when you're a vodka snob trying to get your drink on, this is the place.  You roll up to the oddly colored yet unmarked building and many things go through your head: 1) I drove WHERE to get some booze?  2) Should I be heading to a "meeting" instead? 3) Is someone going to come up in a trench coat and offer me watches, guns, or drugs?    My first step through the door 2007 near New Year's Eve, was nirvana and my enlightenment only continues. It's to believe what you see - wall to wall, floor to ceiling, nook to cranny libations for what seems like miles crammed into 750 square feet.  Odd liquors that you have never heard of but sound interesting - check! Bottles and cans of beers from around the world - check! Glass objects like AK47s and walking canes filled with vodka - double check!  Oh but wait, not a lot of wine at first glance but if you find the secret staircase and are willing to take the plunge to the basement you will discover paradise, or another circle of hell depending on how well you can control your desires. I have never had the pleasure of sitting at the tiny 2 seat bar for a drink, partially due to it being busy and having no time, but mostly due to the fact that I would likely spend eternity walking the circle of wine racks and chillers..never to be seen again.   Sigh....if you've traveled the world and found tasty beverages  you thought you would never see again you need to head here. There is nothing better than discovering a nice bottle of German beer covered in dust...  Run, don't walk to Sun Devil and prepared to spend a couple hours perusing this alcohol mecca!

Looked forward to eating here for so long...too bad it was on my birthday - food was good but the service was deplorable so not going to rehash this too much (apologies to my man and bro as I know they were also hoping for better)  The appetizers were by far the best thing - the entree's were good with red meat being the star.  Peach cobbler desert was all topping that I swear was merely microwaved and had one slice of grilled peach - putting a candle on it did nothing to make me think this was the birthday dessert I was for...   I highly recommend the flight of 10, 20 30 & 40 yr old ports - this mellowed out the complete waste of skin that was our server. Not sure if he thought we looked unable to tip for a spendy bill or weren't as enthralled as the table next to us with his Montana stories but my brother aptly reconfirmed his tip expectation with 7% - too much in my opinion for not giving diddley about someone chosing their restaurant to celebrate in.

High expectations fell short.... Have seen the one in Old Town Scottsdale and heard "rave reviews" so anticipated a happening scene with fab wood fired oven pizza for a New Year's dinner.  Perhaps my Lasik surgery the day before altered my perception in ways I had not anticipated but I really thought that Chuck-e-cheese himself was going to saunter through the dinning room at any moment.   The white pizza left everything that white pizza is somewhere in the kitchen. Thankfully my tastebuds were rescued by the sausage, ricotta and roasted red pepper pie. A few salads and of course pizza at +$2 per topping.   Luckily we had a fun group there and I'll have to think about going back. I think I'll stick to my local favorites for truly amazing pizza like Nello's and Four Peaks.

I've been here four times and aside from a minor intoxicated mix up on bottle vs. drink service made by moi and group and small service lapse whilst sitting alone, this is dining nirvana.   Located inside the Venetian, which already smells great, the entrance and gift shop have the wonderful smell of sandalwood. The stone "baths" greet you as you walk to the hostess station...each time I've visited they have been filled with water, rose petals and candles. I've heard mention that there may be events where Buddha nymphs are soaking in the tubs...could be urban legend, could be wishful thinking by drunken pigs. Either way, I wish I was a Tao bath girl....   But I digress...back to the food. Whether dining alone at the sushi bar, partying with friends, or starting at a special someone this place accommodates the mood. Dark wood, candle light, ginormous statues of the Buddha, fresh flowers, small medium and large Buddha statues abound. I have not yet had the pleasure of seeing the club - but dining here has been enough satisfaction.   The sushi is divine and overpriced...individual order are great but if you really want to be impressed, throw your credit card to the wind and go for the "chef's special". - otherwise known as sushi roulette in Vegas. You give them an amount to spend and then wait for monster plate. The sashimi of Kobe beef (think carpaccio) is glorious, buttery, melty goodness and even better with the smokey sauce that accompanies the avocado tempura (sin on a plate).   Peking duck eggrolls, Sea Bass meal or satay small plate, scallops...you could spend forever savoring. The sake menu is amazing and must be sampled - probably the reason I have never gotten to desert. But then again, there are great places within the Venetian to venture to for liquid desert!  If you like Asian food or sushi it's a must visit for the food and the atmosphere.  And no, the swanky couches in the front room are not for the uncool to lounge upon and think they can order drinks from - bottle service only and all that goes with it!

This is a belated review.... We went for New Year's  dinner two years ago and though it was freezing out side the food was amazing. I can't remember the courses but everything was delightful - very unique and local. I used to work nearby and went to the farm often. With a new job I've lost time and am not in the area as much and pretty much forgot about it.  It's defintiely a hidden treasure and I plan on making a reservation soon!

I'm not a big "gelato aficionado"...hmm sounds like the start of a new song - to be worked on later....  Anyway, I don't get into the habit of eating desert / ice cream to ensure that I can fit into my pants, I am a liquid desert kind o' girl. But I have to say I may have to venture the 3 blocks to get here. Maybe walking there will make me feel less guilty.   They have amazing flavors and pile the goodness high...from rich and savory chocolate, peanut butter, cream cheese options to fresh and smooth fruity flavors like tart cherry, mango and "sunshine" - which just makes you smile when you eat it. They always add a few "left field" flavors out there - I want to be the gelato mixologist that comes up with these!  Last time I was there they had lemon basil which was amazing an really got me craving a good chicken picata!   Didn't get a chance to try the Italian coffee but  I'm intrigued enough to return.

I think my scream of glee could be heard across the world when I found this place!  This Vine turned 1/2 restuarant of the day (Badda Boom then Maddie G's..what's next?) and 1/2 sushi/fantastic patio bar is such a score for us "east valley" folks....  They have great drinks and sushi, never tried anything else. You can't beat a drink in a fish bowl and it's just doggone fun to say "guppie cup"!

You speak Italian to me and provide mouth watering, soul lifting coconut gelato with micro-chips of chocolate in them?!  I only wish you weren't 30 miles away...but I would walk in 116 degree heat to get there - for real!

Great selection of appetizers, rice and noodle dishes and of course pho! I like the signature  Anise noodles but there is never enough sauce. Though the staff is always keen to tell you 'the only other place that serves this is in Paris!".  Will definitely start branching out and trying other dishes.   Clean and great service...and you can go across the street for gelato or boba tea!

Hallelujah! Nothing saves you more when you live in suburbia than fabulous Thai food!  The Som Tum appetizer is the perfect starter - raw papaya, chili, lime, carrot, cabbage...fresh and zesty. Their curry is superb but I stick by their pad thai, paht see iiew and kaprow are all you need...though there is something that is drawing me to try the evil jungle noodles.   Typical out of date decor and overtextured walls but all part of the experience!

I've been 4 times. The first 2 the food was ok, the soda bread dry and tasteless and the service was no where to be found.   The music has been decent the decor is what you want in a nice local pub but the last two visits made me realize this is only a place where you can go if you are white and know people behind the bar. I love Guiness and it's depressing to go to a bar and not get asked what you want to drink for nearly 20 minutes. I've many friends of varying ethinic  backgrounds express this same sentiment. Additionally, one trip resulted in us leaving because apparently we sat at a table that was reserved for "regular folks". Who knew that first come first seated and served doesn't apply - they should put up a sign.

Stumbled across this place while starving and at the office. Nothing is better than finding  a great Thai place and boy have I been blessed in Phoenix.   The "Pad Cee Eew" (spelled a million different ways) was good. I choice tofu - lots of little pieces, chopped chinese broccoli, lots of egg...the noodles broke up a little too smal for my liking. It had a great fresh taste, though a few bites were a litle too wok-smokey for my taste. The sauce was good but not as savory and rich as I have found at Pink Pepper and Thai-Rama  - though still very enjoyable. I had crazy insane hunger so went ninja with the chopsticks and ate the entire plate.  My dinner partner had the beef drunken noodles - loads of food and very tasty. The thai tea totaly ruled, the service was great , and other than the odd diner 60's diner feel and homeless folks at the nearby gasstation that might cause some to gasp in horror, the place was great. A total find in "upper" downtown!

I think I've died and gone to British beer heaven just down the road.... The food is ok - traditional bar food with some English twists. The dinners are usually better and the crab cakes rock. I love being able to watch rugby and it's the only place I know of that you can get a splash of black current juice with your Guinness! That and some bubbles and squeak.....and if you're lucky, some pipers will stop in and serenade you. Can't get much better than that.

I was soo wanting to like this place... Hottie boyfriend came home one night and said "hey, I saw this cool wine bar on Mill that didn't play techno music or look too pretentious..." Sweet I thought so we went a few days later. Only a few tables were taken late on a Saturday night, we were in luck (so we thought). Waitress was decent but didn't enlighten us as to the fact that they had flights of wine. Fortunately I did not experience the "dude" guy I've read about in other posts but I don't doubt he's alive and well there.  Let's fast forward with the server/patron banter so I can save you the agony... We tried a Chilean wine that was amazingly dark, thick, and chocolatey. The bruschetta got us hook line and sinker with all the amazing flavor combos like fig-prosciutto-marscarpone...but I thought bruschetta was toasted bread? Maybe it's like the Wendy's breakfast commercial and panini really does mean eggy-bacon-boat...but I digress. So we got  the bruschetta and I wanted to pretend like I was 9 and scrape of the toppings and not eat the stale un-toasted bread. But wait - the final piece was toasted and actually warm...and it wasn't that bad.  I really wanted to like this place - it's a perfect people watching spot on Mill (itself worth the price of a glass of wine). We had a good time despite the food but I'm not sure I can get into cold untoasted bruschetta, no matter how hard they try to dazzle you with fancy schmancy topping-bling.

One of the best PIMM'S cups I've had and I drink them at home often.... Not so much a fan the roast beef sandwich we had but the beet salad and pizza is phenomenal.  Had two completely different experiences with the homemade donuts - first time they were dark but amazing, second time they were white, doughy, chewy and icky. The waitress didn't seem to care and acted like it was our problem and didn't take them off the check or try to give a us new ones. **Note to self -  If they are very light  - send them back!!  Love the reclining booths and music...DJ pops out every now and then from the wall but not sure which nights/times

Goodness...dusting myself off and getting a few squirts of oil before I get started. Oh Yelp, how I have missed you...  In my new quest to schlep my self through as many new dining spots as possible, I was fortunate enough to receive an invite to Tuck Shop from a great co-worker. Aside from the multiple attempts to get the name right prepare yourself for at least one phonetic faux pas on the phone with friends...  You are welomed with a small sign made of kids' blocks...so you know that you are in for a treat. It's like how I would love my house to be if I had a 50's-60's  ranch block. Decent sized bar, various seating arrangements and chair assortments with onr large table  in the middle and a cozy lounge area.   The chorizo stuffed dates with arugala were delish - so simple but the savory crispy chorizo with sweet gooey date and a little melted cheese on top peppered with a small bite of arugala just go so well together.  The mac and cheese was ok...needed salt and pepper and a little more moisture.   We ordered the chicken and white cheddar waffles - but we passed as they were out of  waffles. Instead we went with the red beans and rice with linquisa sausage and shrimp and the maple roasted pork tenderloin. The red beans and rice had amazing flavors with the spicey and sweet sausage with just a hint of cinnamon. Some of the beans were a little hard but it was easy to overlook because everything tasted so good. The pork was ok - the maple and mustard seed sauce was good...almost undercooked but juicy and great flavor. But I have to say the gorgonzola grits really turned me off...I kept thinking my old bikram yoga clothes were under the table or something. Maybe I'll try the grits next time sans stinky cheese.   And yes, the meal ended with tiny little cookie dough balls... Excellent service and tasty zingy gingerale.  I am so looking forward to trying the chicken!!!!

I'm giving it 5 stars purely on the food I received. Yes - it was empty on a week night and service was so so but only the owner was there, yes -  the decorations are fabulous and the chairs a bit uncomfortable. No - I have no idea what style of Indian food it is or what most of the names mean on the menu, no - I haven't been there for the buffet but if it's anything remotely close to the quality I had on a week night, pay the money!  Run, don't walk to this gem in the far southwest corner of the shopping plaza. Hoping the recent facelift will help but I had no clue this place was there until I walked by.  The naan and chana masala are amazing and the lamb (boti kabobs) - sweet mercy  - it's full cuts of meat, no fat and not ground up. Sweet and spicy and cooked to perfection with wonderful chutney's on the side.  Order take out or sit on the floor if you really don't like the chairs but go and check it out...it's worth it.

Cannot love this place more....like save up all your pennies and open a franchise and work a million hours love it.   I have to say the best drink is the freeze in any flavor - so much so that in the winter I just put on the seat warmers and order one.   Great music and awesomely energetic staff that can put even the Grinch in a good mood in the morning. Hooray for the Dutch Mafia!

I wish "underwhelmed" was the best I could say about this place but a more honest impression would be supreme disappointment.  We were seated and ordered a $170 bottle of wine - it took 20 minutes for the server to come back and we didn't even get water in the meantime. I actually had to get up and find someone to pour us water. It apprently helps to be friends with or share pictures of your kids with the server to get assistance. I almost had a pitcher of ice in my lap while the table next to us had their water poured with a napkin as a splash guard.  The tomato/fresh mozzarella salad was sad...I would imagine better in a high school cafeteria. The tomatoes were white, not ripe and the balsamic dressing average. The 2 bright spots:  1)  the BBQ shrimp, though under cooked a bit, the fresh basil was a great burst of flavor combo with the BBQ sauce, 2) the grilled asparagus with balsamic reduction (sauce is not mentioned). The sides are not the portions you would anticipate - true servings for 2-3, a couple of bites for 4, and I really mean bites not heaping spoonfulls. The crab mac & cheese was decent for flavor but left both crab and cheese to be desired. The plates weren't hot, my medium-rare filet was barely warm and chewy with so-so flavor and cooked unevenly. My brother's porterhouse came rare not med-rare and was sent back. After 10 minutes we had to ask where it was (something about we all have pagers and they will let us know - but apparently there was a pager failure). It wasn't even worth trying desert the disappointment was too much to bear....I was embarassed to bring to my family here and pay so much for so little. For a place that boasts they "eat, breathe and sleep"  meat I would suggest that they go back to bed and you spend your money at any Mastro's, Capital Grill,  or even The Keg.

Great staff to serve as your menu and libation sherpa - which is definitely needed.   Had a few of the signature dishes - pretzels (not enough cheese for all the pretzels), ribs, fried chicken and salted carmel pudding. All were good with interesting flavores but the fried chicken and carmel pudding with caramel popcorn on top were by far the best. The mashed p's and gravy were marginal.   The drinks were great - creative ingredients and names. Went for lunch so can't comment about crowd and volume but the decor is pretty sweet so would definitely want to come back for the evening partay.

Expensive, relaxed, sultry, with a ginormous motherload sized patio and courtyard area - quintessentially Phoenix (or should I say PV).   My first time here ever so cannot compare to the old and on a Wednesday didn't have a reservation so was seated in the bar patio with the bar menu. The cheese & charcuterie platter was fabulous but the steak & onion soup was the rogue menu addition and bad order choice (great steak but processed onion flavor).  ***Warning*** $15 Chopin martinis...but it was fabulous and so was the view. I could really learn to love $15 martinis here.... of course I can also imagine the valet bringing me back a Bugatti when I leave.   Eager to return for a main course or happy hour again...

Was not in the mood to do the table for uno, so ordered take out as my first taste of the Thai Cafe.   Atmosphere is very "cafe-like" and wasn't busy when I arrived. The first good sign was the aroma in my car which just got better after I began unboxing on the counter. I have never had such a large portion of papaya salad - amazingly fresh and light but could have been a tad spicer (thank goodness it wasn't though). The pad se eew, a good Thai litmus test,  was good (my kitten really liked it)  but not phenomenal - had the dark sweet sauce and not too much of the wok char flavor. But the panang...oh snap! Dizzyingly spicey for medium (I think they toyed with me)  but absolute curry-citrus-coconut milky perfection with a good amount of white meat chicken. Hooray for leftovers and a second fab Thai restaurant within 5 minutes of my house!

Rolled in late after a cheesy topless review on a lower level....   LOVE the views and music HATE the ghetto occupants  It was really dead...like scary end of the world dead with only 8 people scattered around the floor dancing. On a Saturday night in Vegas this was just weird. Not sure why - maybe the location but it was sad that such a great view was wasted.   The best entertainment was our friends super-freaking as their fear of heights were amped up by the crazy rides and 'base jumping' option.  I'm giving it 4 stars for potential and the ability to roll in with a group of your homies and OWN the joint if you play like that!

I can't like this place enough  - well all of them actually!   Definitely my new favorite place to get coffee week in and week out, especially the freezes - best version of frozen coffee ever and so much better than iced.   I love the music and energetic, friendly staff at each location - can't the service AND great coffee combo!   Leah
