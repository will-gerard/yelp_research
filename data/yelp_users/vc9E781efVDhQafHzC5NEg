Great staff and providers. They do take a while to respond to phone sometimes. Also, they can get really busy sometimes so same day appointments may not happen but that's not uncommon. Once you have an appointment usually the wait is not that long.

We went there for my birthday. The bread was cold and HARD. The butter that came with the bread was not soft (almost seemed like it was just taken out of fridge). So that wasn't a very good start of the meal. The food quality was good (what I expect from Cheesecake factory).   The worst part was when we told that bread was cold/hard and if we can get some fresh bread, they had nothing to offer. They said it was all like that. Really? Love Olive Garden and Carrabbas for their bread and service.

Good food and customer service. Love the sandwiches and coffee. The owners are usually around and take good care of the place. The lines can be long at lunch time so if you are in a hurry then call ahead with your order.

I've been a Costco fan for a while. This (SE Gilbert) Costco is the store we go to 99% of the time and have been going since it was built. There are a lot of good things about Costco but here are a few I'd like to share.  1. If you find the lines are getting longer these days and store is crowded, avoid weekends. Go on a weekday after 7.30 PM and more than likely you won't find the long lines.  2. Do not be shy to try samples. They want you to try them. :)  3. Use their "no questions asked" return policy (but please don't abuse it). If you are not happy with your purchase, you have a right to return it even if it has been 6 months. That's what Costco promises and you should enjoy and exercise that right. (Though, the guy who returned one year old socks with holes in it, needs to get a life).  4. Gas station opens early in the morning and is open till later at night (even after store closes). Keep that in mind and fill up during off-peak if you are passing by or live in the area.  5. Don't forget that Costco also offers other services like travel etc. Usually you will find better prices on car rentals and cruises etc.  6. The food court is nice where they sell high quality stuff in generous quantity at a reasonable price. Try it and you might be surprised. Don't discount it because it's "Oh! Costco Pizza?".   7. If you find a certain item has not been in stock for some time, ask an employee to look up when would it be available again. If it is not on the list, you can always make a suggestion.  There is one thing that Costco can do to improve the experience. They can implement the self scan service like Chandler Costco. That will help speed up the check out times. To their credit, they do have staff who will pre-scan items in your cart sometimes (when the lines get longer) and it helps a lot.

Would not recommend them after our experience. Yes, they tested for allergy and gave me a list of what my son was allergic to. But no support, no help with what can be done in this situation. If you are gonna deliver a bad news to someone atleast extend some support and be there. Don't stand there staring at them to get out. Doc did not spend enough time during both visits.  Also, as a courtsey can you not call the patient to tell them what they are allergic to? Why wait another 5 days for them to come in when you have the reports ready today? I guess that second visit is very important so that you can bill the insurance company. I kept feeding my son the same stuff he was allergic to while they had the report. I could've stopped if the called me and gave some information.   All they did in the follow up was hand me that report and told me not to give him stuff he is allergic to.   Stay away from them. Find a doc who would help you find the cause of issue and offer you a plan of action.

A fun place to take the family.    Tips: 1. The whole family gets in for $1 on Sundays from noon to 2. 2. Take your own chairs if you want to sit outside for sometime. All the available seating is pretty quickly claimed (even though not in use). They should change the policy that a chair can be claimed only when in use.

Short Summary: Do not go there unless you enjoy "a DAY out at the doctor's". They do not value your time.  I had an appointment this morning with Dr. Atmakuri. I got there about 20 minutes before my appointment just as their email said. After the check in I waited for some time and was taken into the room where the MA did the charting etc. She informed me that there were two patients ahead of me and doctor should be there soon. I was also informed that if the wait is anymore than 15 minutes she would let me know.  I waited for over an hour!! While waiting I checked into YELP as I wanted to review them later on and that's when I read that this doc usually runs an hour late. So I made a choice of walking out of their office rather then letting someone manage my health who CANNOT MANAGE HIS TIME.  Doc, I (or any of your patients) are your clients and you are a provider. This is not pro-bono or charity. Today my insurance (and I) were going to pay a part of the lease of your BMW or Merc (whatever you drive). As a client/customer we deserve to be treated with some respect. Yes, you are a big doctor, a specialist, but my time also has some value. I took a day off from work, and drove 15-20 miles to see you. I was there on time as you guys asked. I ask that you do not be an hour late when you give me a time. I understand that you want to provide quality care and spend a lot of time with patients (or at least that's the cover the front office puts on). If that is really the case please try to schedule your patients further apart so that they don't wait for hours.   Fellow patients, we have put up with this non sense of doctors for a long time. Please choose to walk out next time this happens to you and let the front desk know the reason for you to walk out. Also, rate the providers at yelp, healthgrades, vitals or any other sites that you can, and share your story and wait times.

Summary: If you drive a BMW you should be taking it to these folks. Period.   "People giving 5 star rating to a car repair shop? Someone wake me up!!" Is that what you are thinking? Well,  these guys truly deserve it. If you drive a BMW you have probably had those mini heart attacks at the dealer when you took in your vehicle for a scheduled maintenance (or God forbid with a check engine light on) . I have been coming to these folks for about a year now and always had a pleasant experience. They explain everything, are courteous and professional and their rates are reasonable.   They do not offer a loaner when you drop off the car but given the level of service they provide, I cannot and will not take away a star for that.   Now, paying over $400 for a battery change is a different battle that I should be fighting with the manufacturer for. On second thought, they didn't send me an invite to come buy their vehicle. Now,  did they? :)

Good food, good service. I even got a nutrition menu when I asked for it (the nutrition info is available on their web site but it is not very easy to read on the smart phone screen).  I wish they has some options for health conscious people and those items were listed in a separate section (say under 500 calories, or 700 calories).

Fun place to hang out with kids and family. The employees are helpful and nice. Sometimes they have special pricing through City of Gilbert, Groupon or living social. One of our favorite activities in summer!!

They sell some neat stuff but most of it is overpriced. Always a good idea to use their $10 off $20 coupon or wait for their online sales.   Tip: If you like protein bars, do try their Quest bars. In store price was $33 per box and online sale came to $21 a box. Go figure!!

Avoid this location if possible. I had an appointment but waited 45 minutes only to be told that they did not have my insurance card in the system (though I'm an established patient). They refused to accept electronic version which I could've emailed and they could've printed. I offered to give my credit card for now and fax the insurance info within half an hour but that was a no go too. I was fasting and starving but they did not care.   The front desk is supposed to check you in and clarify all this when you arrive but this wasn't done for 45 minutes. The front desk lady is lazy and clearly disinterested. Such employees are shame to a business.

This is a nice location and the facility is newer and spacious. The tech was friendly and quick. Even the result turn around time was very good.  However, the front desk staff could have been a little more friendly and inviting. They seemed pretty robotic in what they were doing. Kinda like just another day at work feeling....topped off with "Is it 5'0 clock yet?".  Still giving them 4 stars and would go again.

Setting up the appointment was a breeze. The wait time was less than 5 minutes after the paperwork was completed. Dr. Hostetler is very friendly and thorough. He took his time and did a detailed check and explained everything. No pressure with purchase of eye glasses either. I would recommend them.

Good food but service can be a bit quicker. Had to wait for water refills and the check! Would still go back for good food.

1 Star? Yes, that's what they earned. Here are some highlights:  * I had to sit there waiting for someone to refill my water while only 3 tables were occupied (On a Saturday night, go figure) and there were at least 5-6 staff members. Not sure what they were doing!!   * The food was ok, just ok with the portions way too small for what they charge for them.   * Don't bother trying the Malai Kofta.   * The paneer dish should come with fishing poles or scuba gear to fish out the paneer from it.  * The naan was thin, and dry.  * The meat-daal was ok.  * Finally, I had to wait a long time for the check to arrive and then it seems they forgot to run the card. After a reminder they apologized and quickly processed it. We were not there for speed date but didn't want to hang around looking at our dirty dishes after we were done with our meal.  To their credit, their presentation with the pots on the stands with the tea lights is nice. Though the pots were delivered first and then someone came running with the stands and tea lights. That was almost funny. Well, almost.  Not sure if I am going back and I don't recommend that you go there either.

I started running a few months ago and found out that it is important to get the right shoe for you. I went to Dick's Sporting goods and Sport Chalet and they gave me totally different suggestions. Sport Chalet guy was dead wrong even though he used a treadmill and a camera. The guy at Dick's made sense and I was going to go with their recommendation and then I found out about this place.  I really like how Matt took his time, explained everything and brought out various shoes for me to try. I was hesitant to go in the parking lot with these new shoes on when I knew I wasn't sure which one would I buy! But they are totally ok with that. This is how they sell their shoes. They want to make sure that you are comfortable running in them on the road and not just walking on the carpet. I tried three pairs and did not buy a single one that day. He was totally ok with that. I went back couple days later and got my Brooks Ghost 6 and I love them!!   If you are serious about running, give this place a try!

Too much space has been left out for bowling which makes the arcade area crowded. The 3 hour deal is kinda expensive. It should be a little cheaper. The laser tag and Laser maze is nicer than some other places. We had an issue with availability of one of the attractions and owner was really grumpy to give us a $5 credit for it! Not sure if we are going back.  Update on 5/27. Ended up going back due to a b'day. The cafe staff was pretty rude. It seems like the customer is always wrong here. Downgrading the rating from 2 star to 1 !!

I did not get any work done yet but got the estimate (for insurance). They were fast, courteous and thorough. The office location is nice, new and easy to find. I would go back to get the work done from them.

I had never heard of them but the kids thought that the name was funny/inviting. We are greeted promptly and asked if it was our first time. They explained the ordering system quickly. Our 'wiches were made to order promptly and they were delicious. Later I googled them and found that they are a new chain and are opening stores all over. They are worth a try!!

I must be living under a rock as I had no idea when this store opened up in da 'hood. Found about it a couple of weeks ago and have been there twice already. The whole family loves this place. There is a large variety of fro-yo and toppings available at any given time. The staff is friendly and inviting.   The business owners probably need a little more focus on the advertising to get the word out (or maybe I should crawl out from under that rock more often). :)   Oh, and don't forget to get their loyalty card. You will go back!!

I had a wonderful experience with Dr. Kedia at his office. The office is nice, new, open, spacious and well decorated.   The check in was quick and then it was just a short wait before I was called in. The MA knew what she was doing and was well prepared. Dr. Kedia was in fairly quickly once she was done. He spent a lot of time listening to me and answered all my questions. I would highly recommend him.

Long wait!! Avoid if possible. Keep in mind even if your doc wrote an order for this place you can go to other labs if you have a paper copy.

They just opened at this location. Nice, convenient (for me) location. The place was well lit, inviting with cheerful staff. Plenty of options to choose from and kids loved it. I did find them a little pricey as compared to others. Wish they were a little less pricey.   Update: Took some pics this time. Take a look :).

There are plenty of places that sell frozen yogurt. YoWaffle has the yogurt, the toppings AND the waffles (and these are not your regular IHOP waffles). Would highly recommend to try it!!  The staff was friendly and cheerful. We were promptly greeted and asked if it was our first time (as in if we needed any help). Within a few minutes we had the froyo loaded with toppings and it was delicious. Love their outdoor seating area.

I didn't even know about this place but found out about them on the facebook page of our community when someone else recommended them.  They provided all info I asked for and work was done in a timely manner. The prices are reasnoable and work was satisfactory. They have a nice facility and waiting area for the customers. I was able to drop off and pick up the car later as it was going to be a few hours.  I will go back for my automotive needs.
