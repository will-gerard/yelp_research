Wow, I hope the food is good. I came here to pick up an order that was placed a few days ago. They didn't even start making it. They started making it, and told me it would be ready in 25mins. That was about 45 mins ago. Still waiting. Now the bonus is that I'm getting all my food for free, but so far this place seems a little dysfunctional. I will say that Carly who was the person helping me with this issue is awesome, handled everything like a pro. She needs a raise. She is also major reason I'm giving this place two stars.

There is nothing that can be said about this place that hasn't already been said. Great food, great beer, and great customer service. Burgers are the best in town hands down.
