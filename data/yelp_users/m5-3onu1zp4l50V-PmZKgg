Ate here only one time. I would say this is as close as you can get to authentic Japanese here in the states. Good food , a lot of variety and combos to choose from. A lot of people think Sushi is the extent of a japanese menu. For those with that perception I beg you to broaden your horizons and go here to try a few new dishes. Attmosphere is basic, restraunt is clean, food is tasty and waiter is always willing to recommend.

We had a family emergency in phoenix. I have always used Holiday Inn for my travel lodging since I travel for business so much. I am one of their preferred platinum members and over the course of the past year I have accumulated a lot of reward points. I figured that I would use my reward for one night free while staying in phoenix this time to off set some additional expenses we might have.  I arrived late that night to check in, I am told that the only suite left is on the second floor so I take this. I was told that my room was around the back ( second bldg closest the the  free way. I pull around into the parking which was packed, parked rather far from the door and began my search for my room ( no maps avail or offered) I look at the building and it is shaped like the letter U. Hmmm. Second bldg closest the the free way would mean in the middle. After searching for a bit I concluded that I was given the wrong directions. It was in fact the last bldg (next to the hwy ) and the room was on the interior wall of that bldg. Ok so now I am a bit annoyed. I go back out for the rest of my luggage and receive a phone call while getting my things out of the car. The phone call was from a family member reporting on the emergency we were having. While I am on the phone two security people decide it wise to approach my vehicle and insist that I roll down the window and tell them if I am a hotel guest and if so which room am I in. ( I guess the lugage in the back wasn't a clue enough nor the fact that I was upset with a phone to my ear. After concluding the call I take the rest of my luggage in. I might add that the entrence to my room involved an exterior entrance gate ( with broken handle) going down an external hall, waiting for the smallest elevator on earth to come down and finally arriving at my room.   The interior of the room was "OLD" but clean. The doors were in ill repair and in need of replacement. The interior is not up to date which the standard Holiday Inn's that I have stayed at the past year. The only exception to this the bed which Is very comfortable. Drapes, furniture and room decor need updating to new Holiday Inn specs.  The second day of our stay we returned to be locked out of our room. On check in I had used a reward for one night and paid for the second. OOPS someone forgot to tell me that I would have to "re check in"??? This was really handy with my husband arriving the next day waiting in front of the external gate, hands full of luggage trying to get in. We had to repack the car with his luggage and return to check in. WHen I asked " why wasn't I told this" the young man that checked me in the night before proceeded to argue that he had. I advised him this was not the case or I would have done this before I had left that morning. He still insisted he was right and I was wrong. Annoyed i proceeded to Re Check in. The lady which heard the entire conversation then proceeded to ask me again for ID and credit card even though the young man said he checked me in the night before, even though he told her that he knew who I was and what room I was in, even though I had two room keys and confirmed the room that they belonged to and even though my credit card was on file.   Second morning, my husband gets up wondering where the paper is. As premier members we are supposed to receive a paper in the AM. He goes to the front desk to inquire. AT 7 AM in the morning on a Sunday he was told that they didn't have any and that he could run down to circle K to get one.   THE WORST HOLIDAY INN EXPERIENCE EVER. THANK YOU FOR MAKING OUR FAMILY EMERGENCY THAT MUCH MORE STRESSFUL.

We discovered after returning home that we left an item in the room. WE know exactly where it was when we left. After three phone calls to the hotel to see if it was turned in, we have given up. They claim there was nothing found. I rather expected this after our stay and after reading other reviews about others leaving items behind and them not being recovered. I resigned to replacing the item. Holiday inn did send me a survey which I filled out answering questions that reflect the same experience I shared here on Yelp.   In my original review i forgot to mention that the wifi did not work either, just as others have stated in other reviews.

I have to agree with another reviewer, you think it's only Denny's! Well I have to say that for a Denny's this one has their stuff together for the most part. Food is good, consistent. Staff is friendly, accomodating, makes suggestions and is right on top of keeping your coffee cup filled. I have been in on a couple of occasions and night staff is equally as friendly and even customized a few request for me.   Only suggestion I have is that they do need to get the stool over by the breakfast area replaced sometime soon. This has been broken for over a yr without replacement so you can only seat three at the breakfast nook. either replace it or get rid of breakfast nook all together and put in some tables.   Other than this they are doing a great job! Don't forget you can call ahead and get take out too.

Great place for Sushi, ordered the Musscles ( Caution very large order even with only four) Great wine. Ordered Eel Crunch Roll, Tuna Roll, Soft Shell Crab Roll. All of it was to die for. A little Gem.  Pricing is competitive not high or low. Environment is pleasant, service was wonderful and waitress was very helpful with suggestions and information.

Has some issues w noise, cars are a bit fast through parking lot. Lately there are a few people hanging around that don't seem like they belong on property.  Front office staff is very new, they seemed distracted or disinterested in helping people in the office when I went in for my maintance request.

Have been here some time now. We have experienced some issues that have gone unresolved. Some I can live with but others are more a matter of safety. I have looked elsewhere and have decided it is best that we move so we will not be renewing. Too bad as the apartments are affordable , decent and they have some cute models.

Love this groomer. Very good at getting my pet cut exactly the way my room mate and I like her. She is adorable after they put bows in her hair. My doggie loves her groomer and looks forward to going there for her monthly bath and haircut.

This location has filled three orders for me in their drive through. Unfortunately two of three times the order was incomplete. They also don't ask customers in drive through if they would like condiments. Apparently it is a new company policy that the consumer must ask for them and employees aren't allowed to ask you if you would like them according to the manager I spoke with. This often leads to drive through customers having to go back to the store or go in side after going through the drive through just to get hot sauce if they forget to ask for it.   Orders with only two or three items should be easily filled and easy to complete. Probably will not return due to issues with this.

Ordered the Philly sandwhich. The bread is aweful, very processed meat and tasteless recipe. Fruit side dish was ok but that said it's hard to screw up fruit.  I haven't tried other dishes here but so far no impressed and won't use them for any catering.

Discovered them when I was at Auto Pro having work done on company car and had to wait for a bit. Cute store, nicest employees that seem to enjoy and love what they do. Interesting, well organized antique store which can be challenging. Spacious and clean.   Can't wait to go again.

always drop off rx to have it filled so I don't know about wait times. I will say that I do like the pharmacy manager who is very helpful when I need to ask questions.  One staff pharmacist Irena or something like that seems to be more on the indifferent side like other reviews state. Cosmetics person is great, helps me find what I need when i want to change up some of the products I use.

I have been going here for years. The owner has expanded the menu over the years to include korean, thai etc. They have one of the better menus with a larger variety and the quality of the food is good. you an either order in and eat there or you can take it home.  favorite dish is Spring Rolls and Orange Chicken ( spicy)  Owner is always very nice and knows many of his regulars by name.

Love this store for casual clothing and cute shoes ladies.  Love the wrangler jeans that I found here. I have had issues finding a decent pair of moderately priced jeans that fit well. Wrangler Q Girls jeans fit great and Cabellas had them. Also found a great pair of winter boots that look like UGs here and they were 1/2 the cost. Found some great looking, fashionable outer wear and also some great casual but dressy shoes to wear with jeans.   Added bonus would be of course the Fudge in the shop upstairs.

Although I did not purchase anything when I went in, I had a ton of questions. These guys really know how to treat people, they are patient and answered all of my questions regarding marketing materials. if it were not for a contract my co has for the printing of our materials, I would use these guys in a heart beat.

I normally regard Fast food as well..... fast food! Generally the food is consistent between restaurant locations unless something is pretty off. I also don't normally review fast food restaurants for this reason but this location is the exception tonight.  First of all I will start with why. In the past five mos or so I have noticed that some of the TB locations have not been as customer service oriented nor as friendly. Again, I have actually and sadly come to expect this from fast food locations.  Tonight the crew working at this location was very pleasant and outgoing! They were patient, fast and courteous. Additionally THEY asked me if I needed any condiments.( If your asking why that is such a big deal, its because most of the locations now do not ask you if you need condiments. I expect fast food orders that have food which is generally paired with condiments to have condiments provided automatically.  When they don't just put them in there or I have to remember to ask i generally end up pulling around the side and having to go into the location to go get them. Sorta defeats the purpose of drive through. I inquired about this at one location and they said it was to save money and it was the customers responsibility to ask " its policy".  I am huge on customer service so you can imagine how this went over! I haven't been back to the other location in years even though I am near it at least three times per week.  So when this location asked they scored a huge smile from me. Additionally I got home and found that they had given me a little extra! Yay for the times when I go to a location that doesn't provide them, it will save me at least one return trip. Last but not least the order was accurate.  Crew on duty tonight really had their stuff together.

always had great service at this salon. nails were always done correctly, and I always got compliments on the work they did.  They are a very clean salon. They do get busy and i do advise going during times that are less busy if you feel you want to take your time or you would like a little more personalized services.

I have been away for a year and boy have I missed all of you. I walked back in last week and got the same girl that did my nails two years ago! So... happy. She remembered me and remembered how I like my nails. My nails haven't looked this good in so.... long. So glad I got to go there and see them again, I plan on making a special trip when ever I can to have her do my nails. Just haven't found anyone that can do them as good.

I agree with Jacquie H. But as opposed to cloning on doc there are a good many docs they could clone at this hospital. Dr. Gus has put together one of the most impressive veterinary teams with a broad scope of skills and expertise that I have ever experienced. Dr. Koch is responsible for Saving my very small poodle who was severely injured by someone who abused her. Not only did he save her but he along with his staff supported us over a year long process to bring the abuser to justice, providing letters to the court, copies of medical documents on several occasions. The actions of every staff member in this hospital were not only a display of impeccable professionalism and care of the highest quality but a display of their true commitment to caring for animals. The patients that go to this clinic receive the best care possible and I suspect are cared for as well if not better than human patients in some clinics.   I am committed 100% to this hospital as a result of their support and passion for veterinary care for animals. They are also committed to making sure that owners are educated and informed in caring for their pets. They present all treatment options to owners ranging from conservative in non urgent cases to aggressive care with a concise consultation on risk associated with each. This allows owner to make informed decisions. Physicians are supportive of pet owners and will weigh in on the decisions providing substantive and qualitative reasoning for their recommendations.  Another note to concerned pet owners in these difficult financial times is that when these vets present care options they do take into consideration conservative measures for non urgent situations and are very conscious of guarding against unnecessary test or diagnostics if they are not needed. This said if they highly recommend testing or diagnostics it is  generally to confirm that aggressive or costly treatments are actually needed and these test may in fact save money in the long run. They will also recommend test if the symptoms of the problem are too broad to narrow down what is truly wrong with an animal.   Great Medical team at this hospital , I could not ask for more.

I love eating here. Great Sushi in a place that is family owned and operated. This little place does things the traditional way including right down the the Sushi chef throwing out heated towels. I will say that eating here was a pleasure. Great Good, Great Ambiance, Great Service at a Great Price. I cannot advise on a "favorite" roll as everyone I have had there has been awesome. I tend to lean towards the eel personally. I do suggest trying all of the desserts as they are all to die for.   Remember , when doing Sushi you must go with Sushi buddies. The more the better , that way you have a little bit of everything!!

Love this place for great Chinese food. I also cannot say enough about the service. I was a single diner that evening and I was given first class treatment. I waitress checked on me often, kept my hot tea filled, came over and started a casual conversation after I had finished the meal and asked how everything was and told me she hoped I would be  back soon.  I ordered my old favorite "orange Chicken, Egg drop soup, spring rolls and hot tea. I don't know which part was my favorite as it was all very good, very hot and very fresh. Portions were very generous also , in fact I could not finish it.   I did notice that this place is very authentic in venue. Nice but not over the top, over decorated or fancy. Comfy really. I also noticed that this establishment is frequented by many members of the Asian Community and i can see why, it is just plain awesome.

I have used Sandella's on three different occasions for catering lunches to business offices.  Jeff ( owner) does a fantastic job at not only running a great business but also with the quality of food he prepares for customers and excellent customer service and catering as well.  My offices that I bring lunch to love this food fare. It is a healthy alternative that many of my offices are craving after having so many lunches brought to them that weigh them down and make them feel like going to sleep after lunch. As a part of our healthcare community this food is something I feel confident about bringing to my colleges and offices that I visit. It taste great, it is made with only the best ingredient personally selected by Jeff and it is best of all , healthy.

The food is always very good but they get a three stars at this location. I used them for a very large catering order to feed about 30 people. I choose to pick up the order as opposed to have it delivered. When I arrived to pick up the order there were a few things that went wrong. 1. due to the location it is difficult to pick up large orders unless you can pull up front to load the vehicle. Well there are pick up parking spots but patrons who are staying for lunch seem to feel that they can park there for as long as they want so these were all taken which meant i had to park in the far back part of a parking garage. No biggie except the restaurant does not have a cart to load the food on to take to the parking garage well.... they do but they only have one and that was in use for the guy doing deliveries. I had to make five trips back and forth to the garage with food. On the last trip I finally got one employee to help me out with a tray or it would have been six trips!.  Another issue is that the trays that the food is put on are flimsy even if you are very careful. I had thin plastic sandwich trays with a depth of an inch and a half over filled with humus. These would be trays you would serve sandwiches on. The covers kept popping off as they were transported and humus leaked out everywhere. Containers were not well sealed so I also had other food items all over the car. When I got the items out on the other end to take into the office it was very difficult as the containers were very leaky and messy.  I have done a lot of catering orders over the last eight years and this has been the worst as far as packaging, maintaining quality of food and keeping food in containers that keep food at temperature.  I was able to fix the presentation of the items but it was awkward.  I am happy to say that the other pita jungle locations do a better job of catering, I have to specify what containers I want used but other locations seem to be accommodating.  I will not be using this location in the future for catering orders. The container issue could be fixed but the assistance with the order which was large could have been handled better.

We are new to the area and needed a good groomer for five dogs. They did a great job! Best grooming job I've seen in a very long time and my dogs enjoyed the open environment and interaction with staff and other dogs.

I hate giving poor reviews but in some cases they are deserved.  4 miss ago we tried this salon for the dogs. As stated we are new to the area. First time the dogs seemed fine, cuts were great, customer service average and they were quite busy.  2nd time in about 8 weeks ago, I take all five dogs in. I'm clearly struggling with a couple and three individuals are standing behind the desk. NOT one asked if I could use assistance, or offered to take one to the back.  As I struggled one came off leash from a brand new collar,and still no help offered. Thank God for another kind customer who grabbed her. The girl behind the desk checking us in seemed oblivious and annoyed.  I checked them in and returned 4 hours later with my husband in tow. My husband noticed something I hadn't. As I paid two girls proceeded to hand him all five dogs and were ready to dash off until he told them to give me two of them. Then he asked why they were so brisk not really saying much of anything. Well today I decided to give it another go. I took only two in this time. I asked the girl behind the counter if there was anyone available to help me get figs out of the car next time if I brought in all give. Answer : nope not unless one of us is available to do it. I told her about the above scenario and she gave a slight expression and nodded in agreement as I pointed out I was in the lobby and no one offers to assist. That was it, just a nod. I then asked " I guess there isn't a solution for this then? " answer is: no. I proceeded to check out and she asked if I wanted a receipt.  She hands me a credit transaction receipt nothing more. Did not ask if I wanted to add a tip. I asked how I would tip and she said well I can run your credit card again or there's blank envelopes over there. I opt to do a cash tip but now I notice that in all the times I have been here I have never been told who is grooming the dogs. So I ask her how do I know who to tip. She says well they will tell you on the paperwork. Ok since I didn't receive any paperwork on check out and only a credit transaction slip this info is useless. I told her " I guess what I am asking you, is who groomed the dogs? " She then tells me she is one of the groomers ans then states "well I guess. I can look it up " she then reaches down to the desk and pulls paperwork off the top of the stack and tells me the name of the other groomer. I slip a twenty in the envelope and hand it to her after writing thier names on it. She takes it and say ok. No thank you, nothing. Then I get to thinking, I have never seen the staff interact much with customers,  they don't smile much and honestly it's like they don't want to talk to you at all beyond getting the name of the dog, sign the dotted line and get out of our way.  Another thing I noticed is that all three times the dogs come home they drink a ton of water. Most of the time my dogs come from a groomer they run to go pee so this is rather strange. I did ask the girl there if they are provided water while at the groomer and she said they are but it was with an attitude. Now I know some dogs are stubborn and only eat or drink at home so I take that into consideration but all 5 dogs have done this and I have three that could care less about where they are.  Lastly there are a good humber of reviews that are in the "unrecommended" review area on this business. I highly suggest they are read. They are all low reviews but the number of them is what got my attention as well as the content of thier review substantiated the behavior I witnessed.  Safe to say I think there is an employee moral issue here that is spilling into customer service. More focused on dollars than customer experience and satisfaction. Likely due to being in remote area with fewer options but ...my Gilbert friends that is changing as we get new businesses. In keeping with other reviews that are low I suspect owner will respond in kind as she did to others who gave low scores. I hope that I am wrong and the business corrects it's issues. As for me I'm beginning my search for another groomer who loves people as much as they love pets. And I love to tip groomers that do great jobs as they have tough jobs, but I need to know who know who I am applauding for great work. Pains me to write this as they cuts themselves are very good. Just the people aspect is very much below standard. Customer service isn't East but the concept is simple....BE NICE, BE PERSONABLE!

Jonathan was my technician and he was great. I had a wiring issue with the Garage door. He made sure that the wiring was fixed , checked our other two car garage as well, lubricated and checked the springs on the garage door. Everything is working great and it was a reasonable fee for all the services.

Last two times here at around 8pm-10 pm. Service sucks. Orders are incomplete and I have to go back for condiments and ask employees for items to complete the order who respond with indifference. In drive thru there are signs that ask you to take receipt surveys in exchange for a coupon.  Of course this is difficult since 3 out of 3 times I have never been offered a receipt!   Tonight , order incomplete as usual. Returned to get condiments. Discovered customers grazing food off the order counter and much to my surprise they were holding a Bishon doggie who was not wearing any identifying I'd as to beeping an assist dog. Most impressive was how the two ladies with the dog were leaning in close over the counter where food is served. Once thier order was complete they stopped eating over the order counter and went back into the restaurant to be seated with thier furry friend.  Restaurant counter walls laden with wrappers, receipts. Lobby floors had spills that went unattended. Lobby filed with teens who are employees just off of work and thier friends hanging out by two tables near front door. Staff to busy entertaining get friends to serve adult guest.   On cleanliness,  did not visit bathrooms or other parts of lobby for fear of what I might find.   Pictured added to restaurants profile for your viewing pleasure.

This place PRICE gouges customers. I pulled in and noticed that they charge 10 cents per gallon more for Debit and credit vs. Cash on gas. Now Arco does this but they have a way for customers to pay cash at the pump via kiosk. No kiosk here which means you go inside and pay cash everytime. Also this fee exceeds the fee that is charged to the merchant for using credit which means he us profiting by your choice in payment method. Additionally the same fee is applied to debit which is basically virtual cash.   On products in the store , it's great if you like paying 6.99 to 7.99 12 Pkwy of soda. They are a lot less than this even at Walgreens. 3 for 8.00 if one sale.   Will never come here again as I just don't think that price gouging has really anything to do with fair business competition.   Oh well thier loss, back to Frys for me.
