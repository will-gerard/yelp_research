I was referred to come into this vet from a friend.  My boyfriend and I recently got 2 German Shepherd/Lab mix pups.  They needed all their vaccinations so we got one of their "puppy packages".  Found out one of them had parasites but we gave both pups the meds.  Since they are always together if one has it the other one will in time.  Everyone in the office is very nice and our Vet even gave us a very helpful tip for kennel training!  The first time we tried they cried all night.  After his tip of moving their kennels into the bedroom and next to the bed.  Anytime they cry I just put my fingers in the kennel and let them know I am there.  They were trained in 1 night after his helpful tip!  They go in for their last set of shots next week.  I also like that this Vet is open 7 days a week and pretty late.  Makes it nice for my work schedule (teacher).

My boyfriend works in downtown Gilbert and we were looking for a place to eat.  We walked in and there was a really long line.  You wait in line to order then they give you a table, after that someone brings you your food.  We waited for only about 15 minutes (which is common wait for most restaurants on a Sunday morning so no biggie).  I got a pizza and my boyfriend got something for breakfast.  My pizza was amazing and my boyfriend liked his food.  We would for sure go back.

I love Sonic, I have been to many different locations.  I went to this location to get some quick food at 11am.  I had 1 car in front of me in the drive threw and I sat behind this car for over 10 minutes after they took my order.  When I got to the window I asked the girl what was the hold up.  She rudely said "we only have 1 cook" and shut the drive threw window.  I completely understand having people call out or being short handed, but she was completely rude.  Then she opens the window to give me my card back and didn't even make eye contact with me.  She gave my order to me and didn't even say a word.  It was honestly the worst service I've ever had at sonic.  I will not be back to this location.

This place was great!  I love to go to the batting cages.  I love that this is indoors.  $10 for 15 minutes is pretty good.

Drove by this place a few times since I moved to the Chandler/Gilbert area but finally went in this past Tuesday.  Looked it up online and saw that it had nice seating so thought we would give it a try.  We parked and it didn't even look like it was open, only 10 cars in the parking lot.  Walked up and they were open.  My boyfriend was hungry so he ordered a hotdog and a drink, the lady let us know that they only "put out" hotdogs on weekends but they could microwave one.  He said that is fine because we do that at home.  They microwaved that hotdog to death!  My boyfriend took 1 bite and had to spit it out...it was crunchy inside.  We walked back up and let them know and he asked for the nachos instead.  She said she would have to do a refund and we would have to pay the difference...we said ok, he was hungry and there wasn't anything else around.  While we were waiting two kids on skateboards walked in and said that a truck in the back had a hole in a window and broken glass (someone broke into).  The employee said it was her truck.  So don't park in the back.  We got our nachos and went into the movie.   We saw Big Hero 6, which was awesome.  The seats were very nice and it was enjoyable from there.  Wish they had more food to pick from.  Next time we will be sneaking some food in my purse.  I would recommend this place to others...but I would agree with other people to buy your tickets in advance.  We got lucky it was a slow night.  Also they do student discounts for $7.50 a ticket...which they did not post.  So it is the same price is not cheaper than some other movies.

This is the second time I have brought my car to them.  First time my check engine light was on.  They came out to check it tighten my gas cap and reset the light.  Then set me on my way no charge!   This time my temperature gauge said it was overheating.  Drove to their shop and they even drove me down the street back to work!  I was scared it was the radiator and was going to be serious.  Got a call that it was just the gauge that was broken and everything else was fine.  They fixed it for a very reasonable price!  It is awesome to find honest mechanics.  Most shops will take advantage of people.  Will for sure be back!

My boyfriend and I have been to Salut a few times thanks to Groupon.  The first time we had a Groupon for 2 burgers and 2 craft drinks.  Burgers were good and juicy drinks were also very tasty.  Servers were very friendly.

I haven't been to this place in years (since they remodeled it), but a bunch of gal friends and I went on Saturday.  It was awesome!  They food stand had great choices and I loved how they had drink refill stations upstairs too!  The seats are very comfortable and the middle arm rest goes up.  It wasn't too expensive compared to other movies.  I don't know if I will ever go to a movie theater that is not a luxury theater ever again.  I will for sure be back.

I have been looking for a German Shepherd dog for a while now.  I was told by a friend that Saving Paws had puppies so I filled out an application letting them know I was interested in a female.  I was contacted the next day by Laura and told there were only 3 males left.  So I made an appointment to meet the puppies for that day.  While there I met Trisha and Sandy; and I found a boy that I liked;  Another family came in to view a female, One of the ladies that works at the rescue shared with me she felt a Shepherd dog was not a good fit for this family.  So I let her know that if a female becomes available to let me know.  This was on a Friday.  Sunday I received a email from Sandy to give her a call.  She informed me that the female puppy is available for adoption, I was next in line for a female and to come by at 3pm.  My boyfriend and I made the long drive from Chandler to Glendale to meet the female puppy.  I fell in love with her instantly, I spent an hour with her and told Laura that I wanted her.  Laura wrote my name down on a piece of paper next to the female puppy's name and told me she was mine.  My boyfriend also fell in love with the 2 remained male puppies.  We told her we would like to take the female and one of the males.  She said there was another woman coming to view the remaining 2 male puppies the next day.  That whichever male was left we were welcome to take.  We were so excited to get to have a brother and sister.  There was another lady there named Michelle who does their website, she took a picture of me and the female puppy for their website and let me know to come back the following Sunday to get a picture of my new puppy with Santa.  I was so excited to get to take her home.  That evening I sent an email to Laura and Sandy thanking them for everything, they replied that they were excited for me to take the pups home.  Then Monday night at 7:30 I got a call from Laura.  She said the the woman that came to view the pups wants the female I was already told was mine.  I was very confused on why this woman was even allowed to view the pup that was already promised to me.  Laura explained that their policy is based on the date a person fills out an application.  This was news to me because the 2 times I was at the rescue this was NEVER mentioned to me.  I even met Laura, Sandy and Trisha but still this was never mentioned to me.  All Laura could say to me was "I'm sorry I wish this could be undone".  Still I was confused on what was done, why were they taking the puppy I was told was mine a day before away from me.  This policy was not posted on the application or their website and this was the first I was hearing back it.  Basically if I filled out an application first then came after all the puppies were promised to others I would be able to pick ANY of the pups?  That makes NO sense.  I told Laura I wanted Trisha to call me because she is the main person at the rescue.  The following day I heard nothing.  I called the numbers I had for Trisha and left a message.  I emailed Sandy and Trisha.  I received a email at 4:50am the next day.  Trisha stated that the puppies were not on a first come first get, it was based on the application date and this was explained to people when they were applying.  Which is a lie, at least in my case.  I have emails between the three ladies and I that never says anything like that.  I spoke to all of them in person and again this was never explained to me.  So because they messed up and made a mistake I am left to suffer.  I told Trisha that they should have made the appointments based on the applications then so that someone like me doesn't come in, fall in love, and then become heartbroken.  I have always been pro-rescue when it comes to getting a fury family member.  But I would never recommend this rescue to someone.  I am very disappointment about how they are handling this.  They made the mistake and I feel they have done zero to fix it besides saying sorry.  I understand that there are lots of loving pups that need homes so I will find the right one for me.  I just wanted to warn people that might be dealing with this rescue.  I do not want this to happen to someone else.

I went for their soft opening which normally I wouldn't complain because that means free food!  But I never got my food...We went in right at 1pm (when they first started letting people in).  We order the trio (3 apps) and ordered the fried green beans, union rings, and catfish.  We also ordered some drinks.  The drinks were good, I had some Cherry Martini, but it was super sweet.   Our apps came and they brought us fried zucchini which was ok.  I was disappointment that their breading doesn't have any flavor at all.   I ordered the Chicken Rotisserie dinner.  15 minutes after we ordered our server let us know that mine would take a little longer because it is made fresh.  Totally ok, I don't mind waiting for food.  Then 30 minutes later the other food came and our server let me know that my meal was not coming, they decided to take it off the menu for the soft opening...ok well I ordered it 45 minutes ago, if you would have told me I could have ordered something else...but no biggie.  I ordered the burger because I figure it wouldn't take long.  My boyfriend and friend got fried chicken with a waffle.  Again the breading had no flavor, the chicken was moist and very yummy.  But I want to taste the breading. My boyfriend and friend finished their food and ordered a dessert so I wouldn't be eating alone when my food came.  Another 25 minutes later our server tells us that she saw my burger on the screen...I wasn't sure what that meant.  15 minutes later she comes back and I asked if my burger has been started, she then tells us all the screens in the back went blank.  But she would check.  She comes back again and tells us that my burger has not been started, so I told her to not worry about it.  My boyfriend works in the restaurant industry, we figured since there was a mess up on their part they would have rushed my order, but nope.  Then we got our check. She brought our check and explained this is what we would of paid but it was free due to being a soft opening. It was $104.  She never took off the Chicken, Burger, or dessert we never got.  The trio app was $20!  I would never have paid that for 4 union rings, 3 pieces of catfish and a few fried zucchini.  I won't be going back.  With Zinburger right next to it.  I would rather spend my money there.  It is a cool concept.  I gave them 2 stars because the server was very friendly, it wasn't her fault the kitchen messed up.
