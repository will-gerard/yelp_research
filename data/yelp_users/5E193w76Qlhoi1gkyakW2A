Place was great the first time I went, Second time one of Dan's fair weather buddies (thinking he was big shooter) disrespected a good friend of mine over a misunderstanding that could have easily been solved through civil conversation, but he tried to be Mr. Big Shot.    The food was good, but not good enough to put up with that crap ever again.

I haven't tried to many items from here, but the chicken parm was good, I had some chicken dish for lunch one day that wasn't the best.  The bread was fresh from the oven so the butter melted as soon as you spread it, and the free post meal sherbert is the 4th star!

A great place to go before or after sporting events downtown.  Fun atmosphere, staff has always been friendly.  Food is good too (which doesn't always happen at a "theme" restaurant such as this)

I recently migrated my running from the treadmill to the "real world", and noticed that my $40 bargain shoes from Kohl's weren't cutting the mustard anymore. Runner's Den was recommended by more than one friend so I thought I'd check it out. The salesman was very thorough, observng the way I stood, walked, and ran.  I tried and "test drove" multiple pairs of shoes until my feet chose the pair that was right for me.  The price was pretty steep, but the service warranted it if the shoes did not (which as far as I can tell they do!)

I worked near there a couple years ago and would blindly walk in there on my lunch breaks over and over, ignorantly forgetting how mediocre the food was.  But I recently saw a Stixx has opening near there, so I don't even know if they are still in business...

Great food, friendly staff.  I went there a lot when I lived in the area.  The food was great, the only downside is if you don't eat the tacos right away or you get them to go they get a little soggy.  But it is from the fresh salsa, not grease!

I purchased my laptop from there a couple years ago.  I did my research ahead of time, so I knew exactly what I wanted.  They were very helpful in assisting me in getting my student discount.    I was caught a little off guard though, because with my receipt I was offered a job.  Maybe they were short of knowledgeable employees at the time?  Or were just relieved by a customer who didn't have 50 questions prepared.  I politely declined...

Pick Up Stix is another "fast" Chinese restaurant.  Not as fast as a Panda Express, but more like a Pei Wei with a more casual atmosphere.  The give very generous portions, with lots of veggies.  I frequently order sweet and sour chicken at any Chinese restaurant, and this was one of the best.

The first time I came to Islands, I wondered why you ordered your burger and fries separately.  Huge portions!  Maybe order 1 basket of fries per 2 people.  Great Burgers, cooked how you like.  Not to pricey either.

I understand the hassles.  Its annoying when all you want is a $10 car wash and every time they want to charge you for any number of sealants and crap.  And "no thank you" isn't good enough.  They have to give you their situational anecdotes and keep hassling.  Go to Danny's, they understand that no means no.

Never. Again. (at this location)  Friday night was rough.  On the way back from the bar I blew out a tire and changed it on the side of the road at 2 AM.  By the time I got that taken care of and got everyone home it was nearly 3.  I was spent and needed a little sustenance.  Taco Bell is almost closed, so where else to go??  I channeled the old college student within and went to Whataburger.  Whatamistake.  Come to think of it I've had a couple sketchy experiences at this location (i.e., undercooked meat etc), but alcohol and/or exhaustion must have clouded my judgement.  Being the ONLY customer in the drive thru, getting a single burger should not have taken this long.  I would say it may have taken longer since they were adding a slice of cheese they so graciously charged and additional .45 cents for, but wait, they neglected to put it on at all.  After taking one bite it all became clear.  It took so long because they must have been shaking a salt shaker above it for at least 5 minutes.  Gross.     Never. Again.

I've travelled out of this airport for quite a few years now, and it wasn't until a recent trip that took my through Jersey that I came to truly appreciate Sky Harbor.  Being the hub for one of the largest and fastest growing cities in the nation, I am suprised I haven't experienced more delays than I have.  The only times I have experiened a noticeable backup at security is when it is to be expected (holiday weekends and such) and even then I have been suprised a time or 2 at how efficient it was.

All I need to say is Happy Hour/Snack Bar.  4PM-Close (Monday through Saturday, all day Sunday).  That's about the happiest happy hour I've seen in a while.  Beer was 1/2 price. The "Snack Bar" consists of a list of bar favorites for $2.99.  The portions are small, but just enough food to keep you going and not ruin your buzz.  I don't find myself on this side of town very often, but when I do this is a good place to get the night started!

Great Coffeehouse not to visible from the main road (it is just south of Acoma behind "Sauce").  I would frequent this place when I worked nearby mostly to get out of the office for a few minutes.  I took much advantage of their frequent customer program (you have a PIN number so you don't have to keep track of any cards).  The staff is VERY friendly, after just a few visits they already knew me and my coworkers by name.  My only problem was I would substitute the coffee for any sort of breakfast, so I would become quite jittery by the time lunch came around!

Good Asian food, can't give a complete review because I am very unadventurous and order the sweet and sour chicken every time, but that itself is great!  The Pre-meal salad is also good, coming from someone who is not an avid salad eater.  The only downside is the dressing coats your throat and you will be tasting it throughout the remainder of the day!

Had some time to kill between the Chandler BBQ & Beer Festival and the Dbacks night game at Salt River Fields when I remembered the Zipp's Bus!  The bus makes multiple trips between Zipp's and Salt River fields for all Spring Training games before and after so you can avoid parking fees and sitting in traffic on the way out of the game. Sure you spend your parking fee and then some on booze and food, but we still had a good time.  The food was decent, we ordered some chicken nachos and later on their chicken "skewers", which we basically chicken strips on a stick.  Our server was attentive as our beers stayed cold and some pregame shots were consumed.  If I lived closer by this would be a regular spot for me for sure.

One of the best sandwich shops I've ever been to.  The sandwiches are actually as big as advertised, you can barely fit your mouth around them!  I highly recommend the Turkey and Avocado.  Friendly staff, a little pricey, but well worth it!

The pizza is very good here, with decent lunch specials.  Or split a whole pizza pie!  Service isn't the fastest, but that just means these pizzas aren't sitting under heatlamps (I hope).

Stopped here for a happy hour beer and a bite to eat, I had the pumpkin porter and the swiss mushroom burger with fries.  The beer was great and the burger was good, was hoping for a sweet potato fry option as that would have put it over the top, but that was not to be.  A great atmosphere on the patio (heaters included), the parking lot can be a bit of a deathmatch for an open space.  Be ready to duel! (or walk a bit farther).

6 years or so ago I would come to this mall every once in a while and I don't remember it being too bad.  Then again I was a college student new to Arizona and I may have just been naive.  The other day I walked in the front door and immediately starting planning how soon I could leave.  The place just has an over-run flea market atmosphere.  I noticed a few generic clearance stores, and with the Virgin Megastore going out of business I'm sure another one will be taking its place soon enough.  I stopped by a couple other "Outlet" stores where the prices were not very Outlet worthy.    I should have just stayed away and kept the good memories intact.

I had never eaten Thai food before, and I was taken here for dinner after helping a friend move all day on a Saturday.  It may have been that I was starving and was depleted of all my energy, but the food here was great!!  The folks I was with swore up and down this place had some of the best Thai food in the Valley, so I let them do most of the ordering (I wanted to go the safe route via sweet and sour chicken, but they objected wholeheartedly).     We ordered a variety of items, (appetizers, soups, and main dishes) and shared between the 3 of us.  It did take a little while (even with us and only one other party seated), but I was told this is because all items are cooked fresh when you order.  The lady serving us was very friendly, even when my friend was giving me crap about ordering medium spicy and not hot .    It was all very good (If I attempted to spell some of the dishes I'd end up offending someone), I kept eating long after my stomach said "no more", since my taste buds were saying "keep going!!"    I will definitely be returning very soon!

I came into this Chipotle late last night not knowing it was teacher appreciation night (buy one get one free for all education employees).  I weathered the long line because I happen to work in education and I was exceptionally hungry.  The staff seemed understandably overwhelmed, but remained pleasant even with a line out the door after 9:00 PM.  I've come in at other times as well and have yet to have a bad experience.  Great staff, great service!

In searching for more places to eat lunch on the north side of town, we came across Island Teriyaki.  It's an unassuming strip mall joint with a pretty straight forward menu.  Nothing terribly fancy, but it hits the spot every time.  Never seems to be overly crowded, I go with the Oahu rice bowl.  With the buy 6 bowls get 1 free promo I will be frequenting this place more and more, and may try something new along the way.

Having been only to the Tempe McDuffy's (which has since closed) I wasn't expecting much out of this one.  Stopped by for a few drinks after seeing a Spring Training game and it is much bigger than it's Tempe counterpart.  And a lot cleaner too.    Recently I went there on a Saturday night with some friends and experienced the "club" side of this place.  I didn't drink to much because I went a little overboard on the predrink beforehand, the beers were a little overpriced but that was no surprise.  Overall I prefer the relaxed Happy Hour McDuffy's....

I was going to pass on reviewing this place, but I left behind a "You've been Yelped" card and didn't want to be proven to be a liar...  My parents were in town and it was my brother's birthday.  The only Buca in Omaha had closed so they wanted to come here while they were in town.  It started soon after we sat down with a kid screaming bloody murder at a booth beside us.  Maybe the parents would take him outside to calm him down?  No such luck.  We ordered a few items, with my parents ordering a salad in which a special cheese was a key ingredient.  After halfway through the salad we realize some thing is off.  There is no cheese.  So we bring this to our waiter's attention and he goes to the kitchen and comes back saying they ran out of that cheese.  So.........instead of informing us of that they just throw out an incomplete salad and hoped we wouldn't notice?    The rest of the food was ok, when we thought we tell them it was my brother's b-day to get the piece of cake and b-day gift certificate deal, they were, you guessed it, out of cake.  So they substituted a piece of cheesecake.    For that and for taking the salad off the bill, I can give them 2 stars.

I've driven by this place countless times, but never went in until a friend told me about the 99 cent beers and free pizza on Friday nights (after 10:00).  I was skeptical and was sure there was some sort of catch, but there really wasn't.  The place was packed and of course the free pizza probably isn't their 5 star best offering, but still a great place to start your Friday night (though we have accidentally stayed til close more than once).  The service is also great, our servers have always been attentive with us never sitting there with an empty glass.  I will definitely be back!

Terrible Customer Service.  As I was driving past the store I saw a huge sign in the window advertising "buy 1 get 1 free" on wiper blades.  With my wipers falling to pieces and monsoon storms looming, I thought it would be a good idea to buy some.  After I picked the specific brand up and declined on "upgrading" to the performance blades (that were not but 1 get 1, funny enough) I was informed that the buy 1 get 1 sale was not in effect until tomorrow.........  Having worked in retail before, it is common practice for a misrepresented sale (most often from a sale display being left up too long -- this case being displayed prematurely) to be overridden by the manager.  The "computer not programmed for the sale" is complete bullshit.  A manager can override anything.  His only solution was to come back tomorrow.    No thanks, Wiper blades falling to pieces + Sudden monsoon storm = Danger   I bought the blades at full price.  I will be back tomorrow to return and re-buy them just to mess with their daily merch return numbers.  But if a store doesn't take pride in taking care of their customers, I can't imagine they would take pride in much else.

Every once in a while after eating poorly, I need to have a salad the size of my head.  The prices are a little steep, but the email coupons take out a bit of the sting.  The food is fresh for the most part, the lettuce seemed to be a little wilted on our last visit though.  After my healthy eats I'm always sure to cancel it out with a warm brownie topped with frozen yogurt.

I've been coming to Mr. Goodcents for a while and was interested in their "new" toasted selections.  I ordered their California Turkey club, they took my name and disappeared to the back only to come back out and continue helping customers.  I figured it may take a minute or 2 so I let the customers behind me move ahead with their non-toasted selections.  Quite a bit of time passed and what had to be 10-15 minutes later a lady emerges from the back with my sandwich.  I got a "sorry for the wait" and took my sandwich to my table.  It was then I found out that the guacamole was left off, so all I had was a cheesy turkey sub.  I then had to go to 3 employees to get this guacamole, with another "sorry" to go with it.    Needless to say by the time this saga came to an end, the rest of my group was done eating and got to spectate as I ate my sandwich, as well as eating additional time off our lunch hour.  Pretty disappointing, maybe all sub shops aren't equipped for the toasted game.....or maybe they could have better communicated the ordeal that was to come.

Good place for a cheap lunch that hits the spot, you can buy by the slice, or get 2 slices and a drink, a slice/salad/drink and so on.  They have a daily specialty pizza that you can get as well for a few cents extra.  I always seem to forget which slice goes with each day, but the buffalo chicken pizza rocks!

YC's is a do-it-yourself Mongolian BBQ.  You just grab a bowl and start throwing the mixin's.  There is a wide variety of meats and veggies, noodles, etc.  You even mix your own sauce.    I had only been here once before (at the Scottsdale location) and made a rookie mistake of not adhereing to the recommended portions as far as mixing sauce goes.    My meal ended up tasting like a bowl of melted twizzlers, but it was no one's fault but my own.    This time I got it right though, and at $7 (lunch) for the meal its not bad (pack lots of food on your bowl!  It "shrinks" when it is cooked).  You can even pay an extra dollar and even go at it all-you-can-eat style, but I have never personally progressed past the first serving....(I think there is also free frozen yogurt, but again, always too full).

It's a shame to watch this place take the turn it has.  I have been visiting less and less since discovering Stirfry Paradise (both are about equal distance from the office).  The only leg up AJ's had was that it was a bit cheaper with the price of the drink being included with the meal.  On our most recent visit, it was found that is no longer the case.  So a lunch that was at one time around $7 now apporaches the $10 mark when you add a soft drink.    With this price increase you might assume a higher level of quality, but that too was not the case.  The noodles were poorly stocked and no one seemed to care to be on top of it.  The rice was not fresh at all, it had that crispy "I left my take out on the counter too long" texture.  I'm afraid this puts one of the final nails in the coffin when it comes to my preferred Mongolian restaurant.

I come to Native most often for Happy Hour, and the wings are what keep me coming back.  I most recently tried to pineapple teriyaki, but the honey hot bbq are my favorite.  My only complaint is on Fridays more often than not I'm left with an empty beer glass and need to actively hunt down a server for another, and that doesn't bode well for washing down all those wings.  I've come on other days during the week and haven't had that problem.  Maybe the bar could use another server or 2 on peak days/hours.  That's the only thing keeping them from a 5 star review....

I've lived a stone's throw from this place for 3 years now, and just today got to check it out for the first time.    It's a simple deli that had a good sized lunch crowd.  I had the "sack lunch" combo that included a small sandwich, chips, cookie and a drink for $5 (+tax)!  I had the classic italian and it hit the spot!  Perfect size for lunch, didn't leave the place painfully stuffed.  I'll be back for more!

I never thought I'd review a liquor store, but here I am...  A month or 2 ago I was on my way to a friends house and needed to grab a 6-pack and didn't feel like dealing with going to Fry's.  I live nearby and have passed this place daily for the last 2 year but had never stepped inside.  There was plenty of selection and the prices were decent.  The staff is friendly and always good for a laugh.  Since then Greenway Liquor has become my go-to place for my alcoholic needs, and I will be coming back again and again.

I took the trip down the river over both Memorial Day and Labor Day weekends last year, and there was little (aside than points already mentioned) to complain about.    Either we got there at just the right time, or they run a very smooth, efficient operation.  Yes the water is gross, you'll find anything from soggy sandwiches to beer cans floating around.  During slower areas you are likely to get pelted with soggy marshmallows, so you may want to bring your own ammo to retaliate (though there will be plenty floating around).  I cannot support the sunblock advice enough.  Last summer I forgot to put it on my legs, and for a week just standing up was a 10 minute excruciating process.  Also, some cheap water shoes from Wal-Mart are a good investment in  case you need to hop out your tube or if you are the lucky one chosen to pull everyone to shore at the end.  Keeping your balance is hard enough without diving down stream to save your sandals (the rocky bottom can be slippery).

This is a good place to go on a Thursday, not so great on a Tuesday.  We were one of 2 groups on the patio.  Our waitress came by once and we didn't need anything, so that must have meant we didn't need anything for the next 45 minutes.  She came back to check on the other group and seemed to make a point not to make eye contact with us as she disappeared.  The next time she paid attention to us was when we chased her down to close our tabs.

Going to Six on a Wednesday is much different that a Saturday.  Midweek it was very relaxed, on a Saturday you could barely move inside.  Drinks are high-priced, but that is expected.  It looks like I should have checked out the bathrooms!  There is always next time...

This was the first bar I went to as an official card carrying 21 year old.  I skipped my night class with half of my classmates (which  was 3 of us...it was small class) and we hit Mill Ave.  A fun bar, even if it is a little cheesy with the theme and all.    Bar staff was great, our bartender let us test out new shots she was learning to make for free.  I've been there a few times since and not much has changed, which is a good thing in this case.

This Alphagraphics saved me big time.  My life is one big procrastination after another.  This time I was procrastinating printing off letters and portfolio pieces for my final college class.  They were very helpful in getting me squared away, whereas other places would say "go to the self serve area and good luck figuring it all out".  Thanks to them I finished my work just in time!

Great club from what I remember, but the bartender had no problem giving 1 customer 4 beers (only in Vegas).  When I went to give 2 of them to my buddy he had decided to cut himself off (we had been drinking since our plane got in at 3 in the afternoon).  So there I was.  With 4 beers.  I drank them all the rest of the night is highlights ending with me in the bushes out front.    I hope to return someday and check it out again!

A great hotel for the Price.  The One Club pays off getting your own line for check in.  The Luxor has often been our home base when we stay in Vegas, but it loses a star for long walks when your room is at the furthest end from the "Inclinator"!!

Amazing BBQ  I first ate at Dave's when I lived in Nebraska.  When I found they had opened a restaurant in AZ I was there in a heartbeat.  Go with a large group, grab one of the "feasts" served on a trashcan lid (don't worry, I'm sure it has been wiped down!), and have a little bit of everything.  Brisket, Ribs, Chicken, Cornbread, Beans, you name it.

This place was on the DD&D places my family wanted to go while in town, I joined them since I'd heard plenty about it but never gone.  The place is small, so yes there is going to be a wait.  You chose to eat there knowing this so complaining about the wait is pretty ridiculous.  That said, I'm not sure if I'd attempt coming here on a weekend, but during the workweek it was fine, the wait was maybe 20-30 minutes.  The food was great, the coffee was strong.  My only complaint is with more than one person checking on our table we asked for water from them 2-3 times and I don't think they ever came back with it.  Wasn't that big of a deal but seemed like it wasn't that hard since they were checking on us about every 2 minutes (got the feeling of being rushed through our meal, but maybe that is their way of keeping the flow of folks coming in and out).

Slices is a great place to pick up a quick bite to eat when you are visiting Desert Ridge.   I had a slice of the BBQ Chicken pizza and a slice of Hawaiian.  Both were very good!   That is just 2 of the wide variety of pizza options they provide.  The staff is friendly and they toss your slices in the oven for a couple minutes to make sure it is warm for you too.  The only downfall is a lack of seating, but that can be remedied by the abundance of outdoor seating right outside the front door.  The inside was a little warm, but they had 2 industrial fans going full boar so it wasn't too miserable on this hot August night...

The burritos are great, and very filling!  I manage to make it there once a week or so, the food is great, even if I become partially immobile for a short time after eating there.  I swear the rice expands once it hits the stomach!  Make sure you come hungry.  If I am going for lunch I've been known to take the "Chipotle fast" and eat little to no breakfast so I can just finish my meal!

After a happy hour that turned into 4 hours at the attached Q-Lounge, we had a bite to eat at the actual restaurant.  I had the BBQ pulled chicken sandwich, it was delicious.  The pre-meal cornbread and the post meal donuts were a nice touch.  Maybe someday I will return to try their legendary ribs when I haven't spent so much at the bar beforehand!

I stopped in with a party of 6 last week and had a great experience.  It was a Tuesday night so we were seated right away.  Our server Chelsea took great care of us giving great recommendations from beer, to appetizers, to entrees.  I had the 3 meat plate with the baby back ribs, brisket and pulled pork with sides of pecan coleslaw and roasted veggies. I had to stop myself from finishing it because my taste buds were taking priority over my hunger.  I was happy I did because I had a great lunch to take to work the next day.  The warm cinnamon mini donuts were a welcome addition on the way out as always!

We stopped by after the Yelp Elite Event at Radio Milano (and about a dozen others had the same idea).  This was my first experience with Gelato, and it was great!  The portion size was just right, and it was fairly reasonably priced.  I'll be back soon enough, and maybe I'll get a little more adventurous in my flavor selection than mint chocolate...

Great Italian food with portions designed to share.  And it was a good thing our waiter brought that to our attention (he must have heard our comments on the prices).  We ordered 2 half portions and one full (lobster ravioli, a brick of lasagna, and something else I couldn't pronounce) and it was just enough for the 4 of us.  After the alcohol we even kept the bill under $100.  I would definately recommend this place, just be sure to bring a few friends and an appetite!

Wings and Beer are my PB & J.....they just go together.  This is another restuarant I discovered in the midwest and was glad to find one in Arizona.  The food is great, reasonably priced (35 cent wings on Tuesdays) with beer specials to boot.    It is a great place to watch sporting events, but can become very crowded for boxing and UFC.  So it is best to arrive early!

Rumbi Island Grill offers a unique alternative to many eateries in the North Scottsdale area.  The have a variety of grilled chicken sandwiches, salads and rice bowls.    But what keeps me coming back is the chips and mango salsa!  It is very sweet and not what you expect at all.  Check it out!

The title says it all, because once you walk out the front door you are saying "Oh no..........what did I just eat?"  But this restaurant could be for you, that is if  you like to juggle globs of fat on your toungue every time you take a bite of their meat.    Ono indeed.

No kids under 16 allowed (without parent) after 6 PM on Fridays and Saturdays.  I give 5 stars just for that.     Other than that Desert Ridge is a cool outdoor mall.  There is a wide variety of places to eat, and a good chunk of departments stores to choose from.  So if you aren't finding what you are looking for, you just aren't looking hard enough!  There's also plenty of misters for those hot summer days...

During a night of Old Town drinking, a friend and I ducked out for a minute to grab something to eat around 1 AM.  I couldn't tell you where this place is or how I got there (aside from directing you to the map and address shown on the business page here), but coming here had to be destiny.    This sandwich made me complete.  I am afraid to try it sober, as my memories of this sandwich may be crushed.  I can only hope that the next time I am buzzed in Old Town, I can be directed to this establishment once again.

The food is great here, for a price.  Though if you look hard enough, you can find a decent priced meal.  I came for a holiday meal with some friends this past weekend.  There are many new restaurants and businesses in the area, so it was fairly packed (not to mention all of the out-of-towners for the bowl games).  As usual the soft pretzel appetizer was amazing, a double order for the 5 of us was sufficient.  I got the BBQ chicken sandwich (which was about $10).  It was well worth it on delicious tomato/cheesy bread that was roughly the size of a frisbee.    Though we were all stuffed, we splurged on the "I Declaire" Eclaire dessert.  It was a good choice to split among the 5 of us, though there was still some left over at the end it was not due to taste but due to limitations of the human body...

Valle Luna is a place I've driven past for months but never made it in.  A coworker suggested it for lunch the other day so I finally got to check it out.  The service was good, the chips and salsa were plentiful.  The lunch menu was limited, as well as a little pricey, but the portions were pretty comparable to the price.

I have been Chipotle faithful for about 2 years now, and it wasn't very difficult.  Restaurants such as Rubio's and the Blue Burrito just didn't stack up to a Chipotle burrito.  Then came Qdoba.  This restaurant is pretty much a carbon copy of Chipotle (2 of the employees on duty actually worked at my former Chipotle of choice).  I had a chicken burrito (my Chipotle norm) so I could make as direct of a comparison as possible.    The food was great, and afterwards I didn't get that "punched in the stomach" feeling that Chipotle gives me for some time after I eat it (I am convinced their rice expands in your stomach, but it tastes good so I suffer through it).    I also picked up their frequent customer swipe card (buy 10 burritos get one free + free chips and salsa after activation).  This place is closer to my place than any Chipotle, so I will be coming very often!   P.S. If anyone if privy to the correct pronunciation let me know! (ku-doh-ba???)

In my continuing search for good lunch spots in the North Phoenix/Glendale-ish area I stopped by Bravi.  This one may be worked in the rotation.  They have reasonable lunch specials ($7-$8), I had a chicken artichoke panini.  The lunch special comes with a soup or salad and I had the tomato soup that was very good.

Nice place for a quick afternoon hike if you don't feel like driving too far out of town.  I went a couple weekends ago and parking was ok, but if I remember correctly that will change as the temps get warmer and warmer.  I do agree that turning a corner and seeing/hearing the highway can be a buzzkill, but if you hike far enough you can get away from it.

After hearing about this place for some time I was finally in the neighborhood and thought I would give it a try.  I had heard coworkers raving about this place, none of which live anywhere close to it so I figured it must be worth the drive, and I must say they were right!   The food itself was very good, there are tons of  pasties to choose from (it took me a while to remember it is pronounced "pass-tee" and not "pace-tee".......I'm sure a "pace-tee" can be found at a very different establishment nearby).  Anywhere from Sheppard's Pie, to Mexican, to BBQ, you name it.  I plan on trying a variety of them in the future!  The only downfall is it is VERY small.  Walking in I thought I was going down a hallway to the main seating area, but no.  That was it.  With the bar staring literally directly into the kitchen I didn't see anything gross or something that shouldn't be there, so that was good.  You also feel the heat of the kitchen, with only a few fans here and there to relieve you.  All in all a good "something different", and the prices are reasonable (about $6-$9, $9 being their "premium" selections).

Went here for a Spring Training game on Saturday, not one complaint!  Parking was only 5 dollars, we got great seats for only $20 a piece.  Everything was clean,  the food was great.  Next time maybe I'll venture further than a hot dog, but it was a great hot dog at that!    Washing it down with a nice cool budweiser on a spring afternoon, it doesn't get much better than this....

I came here about a year ago and took the usual freeway to freeway to freeway route of most destinations in Arizona.  I recently discovered a more direct route (from where I live) driving up Tatum Blvd/ Cave Creek Rd.   I like this park because it is detached enough from urban to Phoenix to feel as if you are truly in the desert.  My trail of choice is the "Go John" Trail, the longest in the park.  It's about 5 miles in length, though at times it seems as if one of those miles is UP at times.  Parking is plentiful, and keep an eye out for some desert wildlife!

I've gone to Cricket for 3 concerts now, and all 3 were at night in early fall.  Yeah the drinks are expensive, but that is what tailgating is for.  Concrete in the pit seems to deter some crowd surfers, but not all (not a big fan of getting kicked in the back of the head).  And the schmucks who do crowd surf more often than not get a painful landing when things don't go as they planned, and laughing at morons is 1 star in and of itself.

I haven't done bar trivia in a long time, so coming here with some smart Yelp folk seemed as good a time as ever to give it a go once again.  The food selection was typical bar food with an extra something here and there.  I had the bar wings and a few $4 Smithwick's.   Our waitress was very attentive and split our checks at the end of the night without a gripe.  The trivia itself was pretty challenging, I think I had some useful input for maybe a few answers.  And between rounds they gave out random prizes, I got a Rubik's Cube for chugging the rest of my beer!      I might not be the smartest cookie at trivia, but when it comes to beer chugging I don't mess around!

I've hiked here a couple times this past month, and this is another good "in town" place for a quick hike.  I park in the large parking lot near the visitor's center (never too crowded) and take the trail that intersects with the paved trail to the towers.  The paved trail is pretty steep with little relief, but the view from the top is worth it.  I will have to look into some of the other trails for variety in the future.

I had some family in town a couple weeks ago and their first morning they were looking for a nice breakfast.  I had heard nothing but great things about this place, so it was worth a shot.  After seeing how reasonable the prices were I was afraid we had just stepped into a fancy IHOP.  I'm glad to say  I was wrong.  The California Omlette was great, though the pancakes on the side seemed a little off.  But I chalk that up to trying to stuff them down my gullet after I was already stuffed by the rest of my meal.  It was a Friday morning so there was no wait, but I can clearly see why it would be packed on the weekends!

Stopped by Bajio's for lunch today for the sake of trying something new.  I had the chicken stuffed quesadilla which just happened to be the daily special at $6.99.  A coworker had a sweet green chili quesadilla which sounded strange but tasted very good as well! The portions were plentiful so you will not leave hungry.  I will definitely returning to try out some more menu items.  And yes.......the random bell ringing/pot clanging was a little obnoxious...

This Subway has made it on our lunch rotation at work, and I've had more good experiences than bad.  We come so often they know some of our sandwich selections by heart.  It seems to be consistently busy but they get you through the line fairly efficiently.  My only gripe with the place is the mess of a parking lot.  Spaces are pretty limited and are a challenge to get in and out of especially if someone is turning in from the street at the same time you are trying to leave.  We've resorted to parking at the Mexican joint next door to avoid this.

Clouded judgment on the way home from a night out led me here.  I had a giftcard. so I figured why not?    A couple hours later I had a conversation with "Ralph" on the big porcelain telephone  that gave a couple answers to "why not".  Ugh.  Maybe I deserved to be punished.

I discovered Freddy's a few months ago, and it has since worked it's way into my lunch rotation since it is fairly close to where I work.  The burgers are unique compared to the norm, if not a little greasy.  The staff has always been more than friendly, especially during those early days when I wasn't quite sure what constitutes a "steakburger".   On every visit an employee walks by asking how our meal was and clears our trays for us, which isn't  service you don't get at many fast food joints.  Maybe one day I will leave enough room to try their famous frozen custard!

I worked at a Best Buy throughout my college career, so I know all about what the employees go through with the upsells, accessories, warranties you name it.  Yes they aren't on commission, but not getting berated by your higher ups is commission enough sometimes.    I came in the other night because I was eligible for a phone upgrade this week and wanted to check out some of the accessories for the iPhone I had been keeping an eye on.  I told the guy in the wireless department I was just checking out accessories when he said he could put everything together for me and set it aside for the next day.  He entered my phone number into the computer and it turned out I was eligible to upgrade right away!  I already had a case and screen protector, and it turned out if I bundled it with a car charger it was a considerable savings.  He went through the motions on the warranty sales (including the "buyback" program) and was very upfront that this was merely information that he was required to tell me (which I understood), and I in no way did I feel I was being excessively pressured.   While the whole transaction took nearly an hour (I had signed up for $50 off through an online promotion they had last month), I was happy to wait since I was sure I'd be stuck with my broke down POS android phone for at least another day.  I was very happy with the experience, and would process my phone upgrade through this Best Buy again in a heartbeat.

In the search for places to eat near work, I stopped in for lunch last week.    I had the small pizza/salad special for $8 or so, which is a little pricey for a "special" (it would be more special if the drink were included).  I had their pizza of the day, a BBQ chicken pizza.  It was great!  The Caesar Salad was good too, though it was stacked rather high on a small plate so lettuce was jumping overboard left and right.  Maybe I'm just a sloppy eater.  Overall a little more than I care to spend for a workday lunch, but good eats nonetheless!

The breakfast was good, with portions aplenty for a decent price.  The food was a distant afterthought when not 1, 2, 3, 4.......actually I lost count......but more than 4 times we were interrupted by employees checking every condiment, shaker etc on our table.  Some of them twice.  Might check The Place out again in the future, but this experience doesn't exactly have me running back.

This is review is for the service department only...  I live very close to another Honda dealer, but I continue to return to this location because of the level of service and overall honesty I receive. I visited the closer dealer for a simple oil change, and was cornered into an uncomfortable  and downright hostile experience as a result.  Before and after that, I have never had a bad experience with Right Honda. I've never felt pressured into having work done that was not immediately needed. I had some necessary repairs about a year ago and while I wanted to check elsewhere to see if I could get the work done for cheaper, I was more than happy to come back here to have the work done when I realized I wasn't going to find a better deal elsewhere.  I'm happy to continue driving the extra miles to come to Right Honda for my future service needs

I lived a few blocks from this place for 2 years, and only went there a handful of times when it was completely necessary.  I can probably count them on one hand.  It was always chaos in there.    I actually walked in there at midnight 2 days before Christmas once and it was destroyed.  I understand it is going to be a litte hectic during the holidays, but there was no effort being taken to keep the place presentable.  I don't mean items misplaced, but literal spills of who knows what just laying around, it was insanity.  At midnight.  I got what I needed and left ASAP.

I've hiked at Usery Mountain Regional Park quite a few times (and just learned more about it than I ever knew by reading David S. B.'s review).  It's kind of a trek from Phoenix, which you don't quite grasp until you have hiked up the mountain and see the Phoenix skyline far off in the distance.  I've never seen this place too crowded, though not many people tend to hike mid-June (or maybe they were just there much earlier than we were).    I've seen wildlife here more consistently than any other park I have visited in the Valley.  A wide array of lizards from collared lizards to chuckwalas (I'll add photos).  I've even come across a rattlesnake or two, so keep an eye out!  And as with any hike, bring more water than you think you will need.  We underestimated our need and had to turn around prematurely....

I come to this Fresh & Easy when I just need a couple items and don't feel like dealing with the hassle of a busy Fry's or Safeway.  I don't think I have ever stood in any kind of line at this place, it is never very busy.  It is also good for a cheap workday lunch, and sometimes I'll take a gamble at the "expiring today or close to it" manager special section.  My cup of tortilla soup cost a dollar and has lasted me 2 meals!    What I do knock a star off for is the pretentious "reserved" parking.  Not for folks with handicaps, but for what I assume are for people with kids?? (The picture has 2 big people and 1 small person).  That isn't a handicap, sorry.  From what I hear these "reserved" spots vary by store location, I've seen another store with Hybrid Only parking.  If I get around to reviewing that store I will be sure to knock of 2 stars.  No need to make smug folks feel more entitled by letting them park 10 feet closer than me.  But, I overlook the parking space outrage and keep coming back.

In the world of Mongolian BBQ near my work, there are 2 contenders:  Stir Fry Paradise and AJ's Mongolian (formerly and possibly partially still YC's...).  I prefer Stir Fry Paradise because it has never been incredibly packed, and their meat resembles meat and not frozen tubes of meat shavings.  The small "bonus" buffet offers more food if you aren't crippled by all the food you crammed into your bowl.  I like the cream cheese wonton triangles, they rock the body that rocks the party.    Yeah, they are a little pricier if you tack on a soda.  Just drink  water and then tweet to the world how progressive and off the grid you are by not being a "soda drinker".  I haven't quite gotten my "sauce mix" down yet, but that will come in time.  That's the beauty of these places, if your food is bland then the only person you have to blame is yourself and your lack of sauce mixing artistry.

I've attended 2 games here this season, one game far out along the 3rd baseline and  the other fairly close to home plate.  When I was near the outfield, the acoustics were terrible.  I could barely make out anything announced over the loudspeaker.  A minor annoyance, but an annoyance nonetheless.  A major plus for this place is the free parking!  Also when we got our seats along the 1st baseline close to home we were shaded the entire game (another plus).    Unless you are a far west sider this place is a ways out there.  And being in Surprise you are going to see more than your fair share of older folks.  I don't see myself going out of my way to attend a game out this way again unless out of town visitor insists, there are just too many superior options closer to home.

Growing up in Nebraska, I had a vague recollection of Culver's so I stopped in this location for a blast from the past.  The burgers are great, with a few not so traditional fast food menu items included.  But I keep going with the classic butterburger (they butter/toast their buns), and if I'm in the mood I'll top it off with some 5* frozen custard (check out their website for their "flavor of the day").  Lunchtime can be downright cutthroat when it comes to finding a table to sit at, the umbrella shaded patio was suprisingly tolerable on a 100+ degree afternoon.

This location gets pretty packed at lunchtime during the week.  But that goes the same for every Chipotle I've ever been to. The staff here has a good system down, it might just be me but I prefer efficiency over someone chatting me up.  The line can be wrapped to the door and I know I will still be through the line in no time.  Plenty of seating (indoor and outdoor) to accommodate all those people as well.  The only gripe I have is the parking, it can be pretty cutthroat at times.  I've given up before and just parked at PetSmart before.  After discovering a calorie counter online I've ditched the tortilla on my burrito and just said no to sour cream.  Saved me about 500 calories!

We stopped by on a lazy Saturday afternoon to have drinks on the patio, happy to see they had an afternoon happy hour.  After not being acknowledged for 10 minutes or so we decided to grab our own menus.  When a waitress finally came by we placed our drink order and she said she would "be right back" for our food order.  We waited another 15 minutes with not a sign of life coming back out to the patio.  It was not busy at all and there is no reason it should take that long to pop open 3 beer bottles.  It may have taken more than 15 minutes to do so, by that time we counted our losses and walked out.

I forgave Salty's for past indiscretions only to be burned again.    When your Cinco flyer advertises "cheap beer and cheap food" with $10 cover, its convenient to find out neither is true when you've already paid said $10.  Not sure where anyone would consider $5 domestics and $8 tacos to be "cheap".

Update V.3  After a couple more good experiences I felt like they deserve a better rating.  Came here a couple weeks ago with a large party and the waitress was very accommodating as our party grew a little bigger than expected.  No problems splitting the checks and she continued to serve us as we moved over to a reserved fire pit area.  This place is back in good graces just in time for Spring Training!

I've been to the Shout House a couple times now, on a Friday and a Saturday night.  Saturday night the place was packed, with a majority of the tables taken (or set aside for reservations) by 7:00.  Friday was a little more laid back.  I believe on the weekends the cover is $5 before 7:00, after that it is $10.  They have various special during the weeknights as well.    Always lots of "birthdays" being celebrated, and you can submit song requests (accompanied by a tip).  There always seems to be an intoxicated schmuck in the front getting a little carried away, but security seems to always be on top of things.  My go to drink has been the Big Ass Beer ($7 for the first, $5 for refills same day only).    All in all a good place to take a group of friends for as much or less than it would cost to go to a club.

I've been coming to this location for a few months now and have yet to have a bad experience.  I think I was approached with the most add on's yet today, but each emoloyee accepted the first "no" respectfully (learn from this, Cobblestone!).       Today I took my car in after a weekend trip to the river, so it was a little dingier than usual.  They did a thorough job cleaning out the interior and the outside was spotless, all for the basic wash price.  Maybe they took extra care since they weren't very busy on a Monday afternoon.  This place can be a zoo at the lunch hour or after work, so mid afternoon's during the midweek are highly recommended.  An extra bonus is I have been receiving $4 off coupons in the mail fairly regularly, so as long as they keep that off they have a loyal customer!

I am a simple man, with a simple haircut.  This is why I have never found it necessary to spend much more than $10 to have it done.  It's hard to mess up this 'do (though some have tried valiantly to do so and have succeeded with flying colors....I'm always up for a gamble).  Looking through my mail the other day I came across a coupon for a free haircut from this place for their Grand Opening, valued at $17 no less! I figured I'd give them a try.  It's your standard hair cutting establishment, just covered in Sports stuff (batting cages, lockers, etc.) with Sports on various TVs throughout the place.  I was informed that as a new customer I'd be upgraded to the "MVP" cut for free, which included (from their website:)  -Precision Haircut - Consultation and precision cut by a Guy-Smart Stylist -Massaging Shampoo - Relaxing shampoo with invigorating scalp massage -Steamed Towel - Sterilized Steamed Towel and time to kick back -Leave-in Conditioner -Neck and Shoulder Massage (also noted on their site: Massage services are not available in Washington State.......strange.....)  I thought my freebie coupon would exempt me from this upgrade, but it did not.  Win-win!    Too keep things short, cut was exactly how I wanted, barber seemed very attentive and detailed, and no complaint about the extras.  Most thorough haircut experience I have every had.  Not sure I'd pay the full $22 next time for the same treatment, but I was handed a handful of coupons for my next visit so I'll be back at least once!

Stopped in for lunch today, this location has been open for about a month. Had a BBQ Pork sandwich with waffle fries.  With a drink (souvenier cup no less!) It came out to around $10.  The ordering menu is a little confusing, they could use a few lunch specials.  The have family packs you can order, it reminded me of a fast food version of a Famous Dave's.  In the end it was pretty good, a nice restaurant in a nice developing area.  I'll be back!

I'm training for my first full marathon in January, and with some longer training runs on the horizon I figured it was time for some new running shoes.  I came in on a Tuesday night, and walked into what was some sort of sponsored night for a high school cross country team so the place was plenty busy.  I thought about going somewhere else or just coming back some other time, but instead I browsed some of the shoes I've been eyeballing online.  I saw their foot analysis station, with a wait behind all those with the cross country people.  When I mentioned I was not with them, one of the employees made sure to grab someone to slip me in.  While there was still a wait I appreciated the accommodation.  The foot analysis was more thorough than any I have had done before.  With that said, I was happy I went home and put on a fresh pair of socks before coming in.  Yes, they wanted to add on the custom inserts, but I declined as I have been fine without them for the past 2 years.  It takes about 15 minutes or so, but when you are dropping considerable cash on a pair of shoes its good to know that you aren't just guessing at what works best for you.   I also signed up for the VIP membership, I'm logging more miles than ever in my training and will need another pair sooner than later.  After saving 10% on 2 pairs, it pretty much pays for itself. Everyone I dealt with seemed knowledgeable, and I really appreciated the extra effort by the staff even with how busy they were.

This is probably the quickest I have updated a review, but I knew I was going to update it with another 5 stars or with 1.  I'd had my new shoes for just over 2 months, and training for a marathon I've put a considerable amount of mileage on this pair.  As the distance of my longer runs started to increase, I was beginning to notice a reoccurring blister on top of my right big toe, and it was only getting worse.  Turns out there was a piece of material while small, was big enough to cause this irritation.  Being over 2 months out and having some wear and tear on the shoes (they were not quite so white after a couple trail runs) I thought I was out of luck.  But I remembered the 90 day VIP love 'em guarantee.  I did some research online as I was sure there had to be a catch such as pro-rating for wear and tear etc, but I didn't come across any complaints.  I still returned to the store expecting to have to jump through a few hoops.     I walked in and was actually greeted by the same sales rep that helped me 2 months ago.  I explained my issue and without requiring too much detail he began to process my exchange (I was happy with the shoes in all aspects aside from the defect so I just swapped it for the same pair).  It was quick and painless.  I think the standard "love 'em" guarantee is 60 days, but with the VIP package I paid for I was within the 90 days.  So all in all I couldn't be happier with the experience.

I made my second trip here over the weekend, though a little hesitant seeing as it was noon on a Saturday.  The line was a little long, but moved suprisingly fast.  The concept is great, and the prices are well worth what you get.  Having just finished a hike I felt I could down a 3 pack for tacos ($4.50) and probably could have, but I cut myself off at 2 1/2.  The tacos have a unique mix of cabbage, onion, beans, (and more) that may not sound like they go with a taco, but when all put together they do.  The outdoor seating could be not so great come summer, but for now it's great and I will definately be back again!

$3.99 Deal of the Day, service not included...  I too came in for the Deal of the Day expecting a mob of people, but the place was just over half full.  We were seated at a dirty table in the corner.  Once we placed our simple order (4 burgers, 4 shakes) we waited. And waited. And waited.  The server explained that they were short staffed so I was ready to cut them some slack, but we continued to wait.  It took well over half an hour to receive our food, and we again didn't see our server again until someone else brought our shakes halfway through the meal.    Thought the waiting was finished, but we were wrong.  We didn't see our server, let alone another employee, for quite some time.  All we saw was a near empty dining area that looked like a bomb had been set off, with almost every table in the place covered with dirty shake glasses and various other food debris.  We finally had to go to the other side of the restaurant to inform someone we'd like to pay and leave.  It was almost like it was an inconvenience to them to ask.    There was no sense of urgency to any of the "short staffed" employees, if I had paid $4.99 or more for my meal I'd be a little more upset.  We weren't the only ones who left this place disgruntled, it's a miracle this location has remained open this long with this level of customer service...

Lots of great beer on tap.  Stopped by for a late night happy hour this past weekend, Good crowd and I can imagine a good place to stop after an event at either the Jobing.com Arena or U of P Stadium if you don't feel like dealing with traffic right away.

Work has taken me downtown a few times over the past couple months and America's Taco Shop has been one of our regular lunch stops.  My favorite is the XL Carne Asada Burrito (probably because it's normally a late lunch and I am starving).  The parking situation sucks being so small and packed even well into the afternoon.  Probably better that we don't arrive during the lunch rush...

I'm fairly new to the Greek party, and I've always seen this place kind of tucked away behind Best Buy when I'd drive by.  Today some folks from work and I had a Greek craving and wanted to try something new.  So I figured why not....  Food was very good, the service was friendly, and the place was pretty full of people.  Everyone in our group was satisfied.  A great addition to the lunch rotation!

Every now and then when I get a Chinese food craving, and I can't decide what exactly I want.  Good time to go to a buffet!   A coworker suggested this place, as it is fairly new and clean.  The food was good and at $6.99 for lunch you don't feel obligated to pig out to get your money's worth.  The staff is friendly and the refills were plentiful, I will definitely keep this on my Chinese food radar.

I've been to Crazy Otto's a few times now, most recently this past weekend.  I was hungry and opted for the eggs, bacon and pancake combo.  I got the fair warning of how huge the pancakes are and accepted the challenge.  The order came out quickly (I imagine its a simple plate to make, especially as a single order).  I cleared out my eggs and bacon (thick cut and delicious) quickly and made my way to the pancakes.  Needless to say I only made it through half of the triple stack.  They probably could served as a meal by themselves as they are larger than a full size dinner plate.  Overall service was great, I'll be back!

It may have just been the days of drinking, but this midnight Chinese food was the best ever!

I've been coming to this gym for a couple years now, and I prefer it to any other gym I have gone to in the valley.  When I moved to this side of town there was no hassle when I transferred my membership. I primarily use it for the cardio equipment, especially during the summer months when its too damn hot outside to go for a run without getting heatstroke. The crowd is pretty normal, lots of regular folk and the staff is friendly as well. I've only had a couple issues with equipment, such as the treadmill with the broken "slow down" button. But I suppose life is made for a challenge like that to be thrown at you every once in a while.

I came here a few weeks ago for a birthday, and that calamity was bad enough.  I held off on the bad review until I gave them another shot.  Well I did and they failed even harder.  1st trip -- we had reserved a table for a birthday, and as reservations were made it was made clear to us that if we weren't there by 9:00 they would give our table away.  So we arrive at 8:45 and they make it out to be a big inconvenience to them that we arrived......15 minutes early.  Nothing was setup, and they scrambled to get a "party" table put together (which I don't think ever reached the size we had reserved).  All decorations became "we could put ________ on the table but........we'd need for you all to get up".  So after all this I thought it could be a fluke, so we gave them another shot last night......  2nd trip -- Had a friend come in from England and he wanted to go to the bars at Westgate.  God forbid he wore shorts on his trip to.........Arizona, so we weren't allowed in.  It's Thursday night. And no matter how hard you try, you are not a Scottsdale bar.  Choke on your impending failure.

I've been coming to this park for some early evening runs as the weather begins to cool down.  There are enough hills to add a bit of a challenge, and like Marian said there is plenty of signage to guide you where you need to go.  My only complaints are the lack of lighting as the sun begins to go down earlier, and there are sections where a questionable smell with hit you in the face here and there.  Still beats running at the gym with a sweaty tread-neighbor!

Figured it was time to update my review...  In training for a half marathon in June this park has become my go to trail.  I like how it connects to the skunk creek trail and under the 101 to Rio Vista Park.  As my runs gradually get longer I continue to discover "alternate routes" which helps when it comes to changing scenery just a little bit.  They've also recently flattened out one of the more "severe dips" before what I think is the 73rd ave underpass, which me and my right knee greatly appreciate.    It would be great if the trail had lighting fixtures, but I guess I'll just have to suffer in the sunlight during the summer months.  No pain no gain!

I was looking to go to a spot nearby, but they closed at 9:00 so this was my next best choice. There was hardly anyone in the restaurant, but the service was slow as molasses.   When I was seated, one of the front doors doesn't close and was left wide open several times with the temperatures near 40 degrees at the time. No employees seemed to care, and a lady who seemed to be a manager or employee (she went to the kitchen after ordering) let it stay wide open when she left. I along with a couple other customers took turns closing it and the staff made no effort to remedy this even when no customers were ordering. I feel like this shouldn't take much more than a sign that says "please use other door".......or maybe fixing the door.  I find myself in other Chipotle locations sometimes 3 times a week and normally have no complaints. But the service and neglect here was pretty obnoxious.

I stumbled on this place a couple months back after running some lunchtime errands, and was soon coming back with reinforcements....  It reminds me of a cross between Chipotle and Bajio, The overall presentation seems a little more authentic, if that makes sense.  The small burrito lunch special is a good deal, but I have grown to love the (slightly more expensive) Tropical tacos.  The mango salsa is addicting, and the excess that falls off can always be scooped up with the included chips.    On that note, of variety of meals we got (burritos, tacos, quesadillas) they all seems to fall apart at some point.  Not a huge deal, your burrito just becomes sort of a rice bowl halfway through.  Make sure you grab a few extra napkins!

I've come to Saddle Ranch primarily as a bar, but have eaten there once or twice as well. I prefer it to other bars in the area because of the overall atmosphere.  It's a bit more laid back and less pretentious than McFadden's tries to be.  Never a cover charge (a plus in my book), and watching fools on the mechanical bull is always good for a few laughs.  A few weeks back in particular we went to the bar in the back just as the bartender was shutting that station down, but she went out of her way to make us all one last drink before she completely closed up shop.  A little customer service like that goes a long way!  As far as food goes I remember is being ok for the most part, aside from the sweet potato fries which were great with the side of cinnamon, marshmallow-ish dip (just try it, it's good).

I'd seen Pork on a Fork pop up on check-in's for some time now and had been meaning to check it out since I work fairly close by.  The first time I went I had trouble finding the place (even with the warning that it is tucked away).  Heck I came back a week later and had trouble finding it again!  3rd time might be the charm...  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich seeing as that was what was raved about in most reviews (and coming from the name of the restaurant).  The pork was juicy, and the tangy bbq sauce complimented it well.  For sides I got the sweet potato fries and cornbread muffin.  The fries were great, but the muffin was small and tasted more like a vanilla cupcake with a hint of corn.  Next time I swapped the muffin out for the mac n cheese (on recommendation) and wasn't disappointed.  The total for a meal came out to around $10, but you definitely get your money's worth.  After eating here for lunch, eating dinner didn't really seem necessary either time.  In addition to the food sticking with you, I noticed the smell of bbq was ingrained in my clothing for the remainder of the day.  That may come from sitting in the primary seating area that is right by the cookers, maybe sitting in the "overflow" area would prevent that.  Either way, I'll be back!

Thanks to my trusty Yelp app on my new Android phone I found this gem after eating lunch today.  I'm not sure how I've never been to a place like this before, but it was pretty amazing.  I made a half red velvet, half chocolate creation and managed to resist the urge to drown it in toppings.  With a ton of unique flavors I'll be trying new things time and time again when I come back soon.

Should have known better....  Should have known better to check yelp before reserving a salt river shuttle with these guys.  And after reading these reviews after the fact, we should have known better than to take this guys word that he would pick up the phone when we call to arrange the refund he promised.  The shuttle we reserved was set to pick us up at Westgate at 8 AM.  We got a call saying they may be 30 minutes late, not a big deal, we were in no hurry.  30 minutes later, get a call saying the driver just got to where the shuttle is housed and it will be an additional 45 minutes.  A towncar is offered that would get their 10 minutes sooner, but no one wants to sit that close to each other after a day at the river.  45 minutes go by and we get another call saying the driver is stuck in traffic where the freeway is closed due to an accident (where there were several signs in the miles leading up to this area warning of this).  Part of me wanted to call the day a loss and just see how long it would really take for them to get there and what other creative excuses would arise, but others in my party were not as patient.  We cancelled and drove ourselves to the river, all the while rushing ourselves once we got there since we didn't arrive until past noon.

Before heading to the bar for a friend's birthday, we were looking for somewhere to eat at Westgate.  We were checking out menus and were corralled into this place with the promise of free chicken wings (sold!)  Not chicken wings specifically, but a free appetizer (we stuck with the wings).  Inside I understood why there were doing what they could do to pull people in off the street, the place was pretty empty.  We ended up ordering 2 pizzas to share among 3 of us.  They were your standard thin crust "personal size" pizzas (though 2 did plenty to fill the 3 of us...... the giant chicken wings may have added to it).  Nothing too out of this world good, but good enough for $10 a piece.  The service was great (again, could have just been because it was a slow night), our waiter checked on us regularly and went there extra mile for the birthday girl. So what turned into finding a way to kill time turned into a good meal and great experience.

I'm sure my perception of food choices in Vegas is skewed as more often than not they come after a heavy drinking session (either immediately after or the next day).  At that point almost anything would taste great.  Holsteins came highly recommended and after sleeping through the breakfast hour it was time to skip directly to lunch anyway.  When presented with a burger voted Vegas's best, it's hard to consider anything else.  I went with the Gold Standard Burger and wasn't disappointed.  Sweet Potato fries were another plus. To top things off I ordered one of the "boozy milkshakes", going with the Oreo and Bailey's version (I wasn't adventurous enough to go for the Captain Crunch).  I left plenty satisfied and a little overstuffed, but overall I would recommend this place for a hearty lunch or dinner (skipping breakfast was a good call).

I went to 2 Spring Training games at his stadium this year, and had 2 different experiences.  The first game we parked ourselves and passed several incompetent lot attendants just standing there.  As there were no barricades and they made no indication otherwise, we assumed it was ok to pull in.  It was only at this time that they waved their arms and said we had to park at the back of the lot.  This happened 3 times.  The second trip we opted for the free shuttle from Zipps, This took the pain out of their incompetence out of the equation.  Once we got in the park we had a great time both trips.  There is ample shade covering a good portion of the seated area for afternoon games.  Beer prices were a little steep, but we were happy to pay $8 for a pitcher or 2 of Blue Moon at Zipps beforehand to take the sting out of the $8 cups at the field.    Of all the stadiums I've visited in Phoenix, this one has been the best (aside from parking annoyances).  It will be a challenge to top this facility.

This place keeps popping up on my home page to review since I checked in, but I have avoided it for reasons I'm not sure of.  It's a smokin deal ($6.99 for lunch) but at the same time I'm not surprised.  You get what you pay for....  The food is about everything you can imagine, and not just chinese food.  There is mac n cheese, polish sausage, chicken wings you name it.  I usually keep it simple going for rice and some sort of breaded, deep fried  meat with sauce.  And some vegetables to kid myself that this meal has some nutritional value.  I can have a sweet tooth now and then, but I will never understand or venture towards the whole scoop your own ice cream with the scoop sitting in a cup of dirty water routine.    So I'm not a huge fan of this place, but can't say I won't be dragged back when the need for a mountain of food (that I will later regret) comes my way.

A nice new facility, but with some shortfalls that has little to do with the staff, but most likely the people who run the joint.  I've been here twice now, and both visits have ended in an akward 10-20 minutes after the show waiting to receive our bill and/or have our bill cashed out.  I don't know if they just don't have enough servers for the number of people that can occupy the place, but they really need to evaluate efficiency here.  Our server was extra slow last night because the people next to us tried to skip out on a $100+ tab, which crossed our mind as we waited after the show and half the place cleared out before receiving our bill.    If this becomes a regular thing I see it becoming a problem as the novelty of a new club wears off and they have to rest on their reputation and service.  Oh yeah and 15% auto gratuity no matter what the size of your group?  Very sneaky!

After eating here today, all other Greek restaurants are dead to me...  The menu is simple enough with large pictures for someone like me who is not yet familiar with all the terminology when it comes to Greek food.  The owner was beyond friendly, and was willing to field questions as we stared at the menu making our decision.  My indecision brought me to the 2 meat plate, both the beef and the chicken were delicious.  Rice was great and plentiful, and we were even brought pita bread for our already enormous lunch.  I will definitely be back (with reinforcements).  I was only there an hour ago and I am already thinking about attacking my take-home box in the fridge.

While on lunch a week or so ago I saw the signage for this new location, and on a 100 degree Sunday afternoon I figured it was time to check it out.  I had been to the Bell Rd location before so I knew what to expect for the most part.  It was nice to see this location is a bit larger, as the Bell Rd location seems cramped (if not as well laid out).  There are 16 flavors to choose from, and a spread of toppings ranging from fruit to cereal to candy bars to you name it.  At 39 cents per ounce you won't be breaking the bank unless you fill their largest tub to the brim.  They also have a loyalty card that (unless my math sucks) equals out to a free $5 cup for every $50 spent.

I've stopped by this location a couple times over the past month and both times have received good service.  The inside is new and clean, the wait staff had no problem splitting the checks for our group.  I'm on a no carb/no potato kick and the wood fired chicken has been my go to on both occasions (roasted veggies substituted for the mashed potato), the portion was very generous for only $9.99!  I probably could have taken half of it home for another meal but it tasted so good I polished it off with no regrets.

For 3 years I was a subscriber to "chronic cardio" as my form of exercise.  I signed up for race after race to stay motivated and completed my first full marathon a year ago.  During that period I dodged knee problems here and there, and after the marathon the injuries seemed to stick around longer than ever.  That's when I knew I had to change things up, and a friend recommended Crossfit West Valley.  The workouts are always challenging, but are scaled to accommodate varying skill levels.  The staff is very helpful and thorough with instruction and advice when it comes to diet and other recommendations when it comes to getting the best results.  Within the first month I was in better shape than when I was at the height of my distance running, and 6 months later I am still improving.  I'd recommend this gym to anyone looking for a unique and challenging way to get in shape.

I stopped in at lunch time after seeing this place on the "new businesses" section on the Yelp homepage.  The map seems to be off, this place is located next to the AMC 30 and Starbucks at the Deer Valley Town (Towne?) Center.  I was reluctant at first because the only other pizza joint like this I had tried before in North Phoenix (I forget the name) missed the mark pretty bad (over priced and not filling).  The set up is straight forward, any pizza or salad is $7.75.  They have a few pre-built options, otherwise you can build your own.  I went the build your own route and rattled off a few of my go-to toppings. There was plenty more options and it would be nice if there were labels or a cheat sheet as I might want to get a little more adventurous in the future. I didn't feel like being the "what's that?...and that?...and that?" guy.  The pizza itself took only a few minutes to cook and seemed to be just about the right size for a lunch portion (I could have saved a bit for later but was exceptionally hungry). The staff was very helpful and friendly, and after reporting back to folks at the office I'm sure I'll be returning sometime in the near future.
