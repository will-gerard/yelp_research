Close, quick, yummy.  I love that there are TONS of vegetarian options.  My favorite is the Caprese - mostly because I am a cheese addict.  My co-workers tell me that the one with turkey and chiles is fantastic.  The service is personal and friendly, and they are really quick.  What I don't love are the prices.  I always think it's a little spendy for a sandwich and some chips for lunch, but then I take a bite and I forget.

I want Tom's to be better... but it isn't.  The place has a cool "Cheers" vibe, the service is excellent, but...  I ordered a grilled cheese.  The simplest thing on the menu, right?  WRONG!    Those of you who are grilled cheese experts, like I am** will understand when I say: there was no butter on the bread and there was only one paltry slice of american cheese.  Seriously.  At least give me some cheese for my grilled cheese sandwich.  It's even in the title!  I am sure that Tom's has more options for non-carnivores on their huge menu, but I was in a hurry and didn't have time to peruse the menu at length or concoct a special order.  The worst part?  My sub-par grilled cheese, fries, and iced tea came to $12!!!  Come on!  They put a piece of individually wrapped cheese between two dry pieces of toast!  At least the service was good.  **side note: I really wish more restaurants would get on the options for vegetarians bandwagon.  No, I do not want iceberg lettuce on a plate with italian dressing, thank you.

Red Devil has been around since before dirt was invented, and there is a reason: it is GOOD.  I love love love their bruchetta.  It is, no hyperbole, the best in town.  I don't know where they get those tomatoes, but I have never tasted a bad one there.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Pizza=to die for.  Amazing.  The hubs and I usually split a white pie, and never regret it.... well, if you don't count the regret I feel that I over ate!  We have tried the entrees, but we always go back to the pizza.  It is really that good.  Go to Red Devil - what have you been waiting for?  Have some bruschetta.  Go home full.

I love Trader Joe's and this is one of my favorites in town - Far bigger than the Gilbert location.  I love that I can always find something new and yummy to try - and that is sometimes very hard as a vegetarian.  I love the produce, the sauces, the soy selections.  I also love that I can find animal product free & cruelty free household products, which means that I don't have to go all over town to get what I need.  Go here.  Get some meatless meatballs and some whole wheat pasta.   Have a tasty dinner.

So, when you get married, you have to buy rings.  This sucks.  Especially if you have grandma's engagment ring, and what you had in mind for a wedding band to go with it doesn't exist.    So, I found something on the internets that I like and can live with, a simple channel set band with a dip in it to accomodate the setting on the other ring... something that almost every jeweler carries, a fact that we decided to capitalize on.    Enter Fiesta Mall Jewelers... all 50 of them.  We shopped around a little bit, found that almost every jeweler is less than helpful, and sometimes completely unfriendly.... Except for Heidi at Samuel's Jewelers.  Heidi was FANTASTIC.  She was fun, excited for us, and went out of her way to make sure that we were happy with our decision.   She gave me a hug when we left.  She reminded both the Hubs and I of my aunt Carrie, a very good thing.  Now, I am a reasonable, rational person, and I totally understand that Heidi was simply a great salesperson who knows just what to do and say to make the sale, and we probably spent a few dollars more than we could have elsewhere, but a good experience is important too.  We left feeling pretty good about it.  And you know what, when we went back in to pick up the ring, Heidi remembered us - by name.  I think that is pretty awesome, and salesmen everywhere should take note.  Why 4 stars?  It's in Fiesta Mall... you understand.  So.  Get married.  Go to Samuel's in Fiesta.  Talk to Heidi.  Leave happy.

I really love PF Changs.  They offer lots of vegetarian options (even lettuce wraps - YUM).  I went there the other night with a large party for someone's birthday.  We had reservations and the place was slow, so we sat right away.  The waitress was very prompt and attentive, even though we could all tell that she was a little worried about having a large party.    We hardly waited at all for our dinners - which were a combination of vegetarian and meated dinners.    I had the Ma Po Tofu.  It was so good - and when I went home and looked up the fattiness thereof, it is a reasonable and healthful choice!  How exciting and refreshing is that?  I will definitely go back to PF's.  (and it's little sister Pei Wei.)  Yum!

I don't drink... but Seamus' is an alright place in my book.  We dropped in after a DBack's game the other night, and I was seriously about to chew off my own arm I was so hungry (and nothing else was open within walking distance... at 10pm... after a baseball game...in the 5th largest city in the nation. Seriously people.).    Seamus' came through for me though - even though the kitchen was about to close and they were only serving apps... I was able to find something veg to eat - Potato Skins, sans bacon.  The service was acceptable overall, but the waitress went out of her way to make sure that I was happy.  When the skins came out with bacon, she had the kitchen remake them right away.  I had to knock off one of the stars because Seamus' is a little bit dirty.  Old bar dirty, not anything to be completely grossed out over... but still.  Go here.  If you drink, have a pint.  Try some food (if you get there early enough).

I, apparently, am one of the few people that actually likes My Florist.  I think that all you need to know is that the Jazz pianist kicks ass.  Seriously.  She is fantastic.  Just get a drink, sit at the bar and listen. You don't need a $12 foo foo drink, just get a coke (or a tea, which is chai and yummy).  The atmosphere is "wine bar."  There are gay men more feminine than me on dates.  There are yuppies. There are snooty old people.  DUH. Come on people!  If you live downtown, you have encountered all of these people in your day, and you came out all right. I am way more hippie than yuppie, and I survived.  (Side note:  Why are there 57 "wine bars" in downtown Phx?  Can we get a variety here?)  MF has a decent selection of vegetarian items, and everything that I have tried has been good, but this is not the reason to go to MF.  The pianist is.  So.  Go here.  Try some good bread (made right next door), and listen to that pianist.  She is awesome.  I want to have her babies.

We live in the building right next door to Calabria.  Before we moved in, I was sort of excited to see the word "grocery" so close.  You know, for those milk emergencies.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed to find that Calabria is NOT a grocery store - just a restaurant that offers an EXTREMELY limited selection of "grocery" items - olives, spices, etc.  (I was thinking it would be like San Diego's Fillipi's).  That said, Calabria makes a mean sandwich.  I had a Caprese (one of my favorites) and it was on awesome bread, with a great cheese, and had lots of flavor (something that is sometimes lacking in a Caprese.)  The hubs had a meatball sub and commented on it's deliciousness.  We will definitely go back to Calabria.  It is close and good, even with the "false advertising."

I inherited a lawn mower from my father in law. It looked like it was missing a cable, and the blade would not start. I took it in to Ricardo's. He looked at my lawn mower and told me worked fine. I was a little surprised and restated my concern to him. He took me out to my lawn mower and started right up and engaged the blade. I offered to pay him for his time and he refused. I want to point out he easily could have "fixed" my lawn mower, charged me, and I probably would never have known. It is honest small business owners like this that make our economy work. It looks like he sells lawn mowers, and other yard care equipment. I will use him for all of the services as I need them and I implore Yelp readers to do the same.

So, the premise behind Banfield is awesome.  It makes owning a pet and keeping it healthy financially accessible to those of us who aren't made of money.  The reality of Banfield... well, it stinks.  Worse than an infected anal gland on a Great Dane.  In the past few years, the hubs and I have accquired two exceedingly cute Miniature Schnauzers.  In this time, we have been to 4 different Banfields, and with the exception of one (where a friend worked), we have had a terrible experiences.    Sure, you don't have to pay for office visits or vaccinations (except for the monthly fee... which is amazingly reasonable), but you they find something that isn't covered by the plan EVERY TIME.  Seriously, it is like taking your car in for service.  Oh, it needs power steering fluid?  my clutch needs adjusting?  and my brakes are at 10%?  Well, crap, I thought I just needed to get my tires filled up with air.  Now, I might be a little bit bitter having just dropped a shiteload of money at Banfield because one of the little treasures ate some Aleve (Aleve=death to dogs).  But during the course of his treatment, which I was told was very urgent, I was informed that I needed to leave the dog there (for a fee) because they were going to lunch and couldn't treat him at that moment.  When I told them that I wanted to take the treatment one step at a time (instead of going in all guns blazing), I was treated with contempt.  After I specifically told them I wanted to wait on a particular item, I can see the vet and the techs in the back performing that exact thing on my dog.  My requests were ignored.  When I had questions that required the vet's answers (not the uninformed "nurse"), they were ignored.  All in all, it was a terrible experience - and not the first terrible experience at Banfield, simply the most recent.  So, take your dogs to Banfield, but ONLY for vaccinations/yearly checkups.  You are better off going to a "regular" vet for everything else.

We tried Crazy Jim's on a whim the other night  - Very good!!  The reviews here do not lie.  They have the softest, fluffiest, yummiest pita bread I have ever had!  It was almost like Indian fry bread... but not as fried.  Yum.  We had a couple of small pizzas, some hummus, and a side salad.  The prices were reasonable, the service was fantastic, and the food was awesome.   My only complaint about Crazy Jim's would have to be the cramped dining area.  We squeezed in between a couple on a first date and a couple who had clearly been married since time began.  An interesting dichotomy (we are newly married...), but I am one that likes a little private dinner conversation (you know?)  Anyway, I think CJ's would be fantastic for lunch, takeout, or a quick low key dinner.  Go there.  Eat some yummy pita.  Leave full.

I feel as though I have written a review of Trim Time before - but I guess not. Better late than never.  Jennifer rocks. No, really. She, and the rest of her staff at Trim Time are awesome.   I like my dogs groomed a certain way - instructions for which I gave Jennifer on our very first visit when the pups were mere weeks old. They are now three years old, and they are always groomed impeccably on every visit, with no reminders of my expectations. (Apparently, Jennifer is either a genius memory savant, or they write it down... I think it is probably the former.)  My husband can take the dogs in and not worry that I won't be happy with the results.   Not only is Trim Time awesome, but they give back too. Jennifer has an animal rights blog, and at least twice over the time we have been going there has had charity events (One is coming up on Friday July 3rd!)  If you are looking for a groomer, and you live in the greater Southwestern United States, Jennifer is your woman. I think I would take the dogs to her even if I lived in San Diego. Seriously, she is that good.

Yes, the service is slow, but the food is fantastic.  I say this while eating leftovers for breakfast... so. yummy.  Great cheese selection, awesome, jam packed menu, cool drink list.  I had the cheese, garlic and tomato lavosh pizza (I can't remember the name) - YUM.  yum.  I put some avocado on it for breakfast this morning, and it was killer.  Go here.  Have a snack first.  Brush off the waitstaff, because they seemed to get friendlier and friendlier as the night went on.  yum.

I have been going to Cafe Lalibela since it opened, which was a few years before I even moved to the valley.  I have never had a bad experience or anything less than excellent food.  They have an enormous menu, but I usually tell the waitress to bring me whatever is good - and vegetarian.  The waitstaff is prompt, attentive and very helpful.  The food is the star, from the injera to the teas, you simply can not go wrong at Lalibela.  Ethiopian food is unlike anything else, and it is SO tasty.  My only problem is convincing my friends to go with me!

This restaurant is a vegetarian's fondest dream - and I am no exception.  The service is friendly and personable, and best of all, quick!  This is my favorite place to meet up with my girlfriends and spend a couple of hours chatting.  The hummus is good, if a smidge spicy. The tofu is fantastic.    Go there.  Eat some good food.  You won't miss meat at all.

I adore Carly's. I love that our favorite Aussie waiter remembers us when we come in. I love that we can walk there. I love that they have more than a few vegetarian options. I love that they have Terra chips.   But I especially love that the menu has some innovation and creativity. Yay for not having to order a grilled cheese every time!  Yay for having a vegetarian soup! Yay for having great salads that aren't iceberg lettuce with some dressing slopped on top! Yay for having fantastic hummus and olive tapenade!  Yay for NOT having french fries!  So, I say, Yay for Carly's. Keep it up.

So, I have to admit that I once threw up in the Pita Jungle bathroom, but it was not Pita Jungle's fault - it was definitely something I ate the night before.  It certainly made for a memorable first date experience with my now husband, and we have been back many many times.  Oh, how I love Pita Jungle.  I haven't tried anything that I wouldn't have again in a heartbeat - currently I am hooked on the Potato Pizza.  yummy!  Their breakfast options are wonderful - definitely try it on a lazy Sunday morning.  There is usually no wait.  The ambiance is fantastic, casual and arty, with a little bit of crunchy granola thrown in.  A++ for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike.    Eat hummus and pita.  Try falafel.  Try anything on the menu, because it is all good.

Well, I have to add my $.02. Tait is awesome. I have been taking my cars to him since I moved to Phoenix about 8 years ago. I think I threw at a dart at the phone book - and got really lucky.   From my first visit, when I was a single lady, and now that I am married, I see absolutely no difference in the amazing service I get from Tait and his crew. As others have said, I feel like I get a straight story from him. My husband was skeptical about my praise of HonMan prior to the purchase of his first Honda (in 2006), but I was adamant that our cars go there. My husband was converted the moment he stepped into the lobby to talk to Tait. He is just a good guy.   When my husband and I decided to buy a new (used) car this year, we had a list of acceptable options that included a variety of makes and models... that is, until we remembered how great Tait's shop is. We decided that we only feel comfortable owning Hondas so that Tait's crew will service them. Maybe that is silly (I am sure there are other quality auto mechanics around), but who wants to start over?

We love Amano's! I'm not sure why I haven't written a review until now. The food is great! The pizzas are very good as are the pastas and meat dishes. Be sure to check out the specials menu. The service is excellent. It's always a pleasure to be waited on by Patrice- she is quick, knows the menu, and appears with crayons and coloring pages right when my kids need it.   Try the antipasti platter. Try the AMAZING balsamic glazed strawberry dessert.   Tread carefully around the after-dinner carmels. Most of the time they are amazing (vanilla black balsamic: omg), but I will *never* get the flavor of the rosemary one out of my mouth. My advice: ask the flavor first.

So, for the last couple of years, the hubs and I have been die-hard Harkins fans.  It's a local company, the theatres are clean, the popcorn is good, and best of all, you can get a plastic cup for the same price as a regular drink that can be refilled for just $1.    That said, AMC Arizona Center had an uphill battle to fight when we decided to ride our bikes over yesterday because there isn't a Harkins within biking distance.  I thought ahead and got the AMC MovieWatcher card in the mail, which we used, though it didn't get us anything off the price of the movie or anything special at concessions (I think I knew that already though).  The prices are reasonable - $10 for the two of us for a Saturday morning matinee isn't too bad!  The price for concessions was a little spendy, but everyone knows that already.   We ended up spending $2.25 more than we would have at Harkins... and we didn't spend any money on gas, so I think they did well price-wise.  The ushers and ticketpeople were very friendly and nice, and the theater is very clean, except for the bathroom (and as Amy D. noted, the theater smelled like feet.  What gives, AMC?).    The loo was 98% clean - and that 2% is icky.  Stop reading here if you are of the sensitive of stomach.     There was poo on the floor in the next stall over from mine.  No, not a little drip.  A whole turdlet.  Someone missed the bowl entirely.  This can certainly not be blamed on the cleaners of the bathroom - so I can't really dock them any stars for that, but ew!!!  That is so gross.  Back to the review.  I would definitely go back to AMC.  It's close, convenient, and I think that MovieWatcher card will get us something good someday.

Well, we took our two schnauzers to Smelly Dog based on some great reviews on Yelp and from a guy with his own schnauzer in our apartment complex.  We were moving, and our regular groomer is out in Mesa... we chose convenience over excellence. Big mistake.   We were able to get in for an appointment in a reasonable amount of time, the staff seemed fairly friendly, and I was in and out in just a few minutes.   So, what was the problem?  I am pretty specific about how I like my dogs groomed, and I was clear with the groomer EXACTLY how I wanted them done (I could go into specifics, but I wouldn't want to be boring... suffice it to say that my list of requests was only about 3 items long).  Basically, NONE of the directions I gave were followed.  Not one.  Not only was my finickiness not satiated, but the basic schnauzer (and every other hairy dog) grooming items that should always be done without a specific request to do so were not done (ear plucking, anal glands expressed (yuck), shaved belly and between the foot pads).  I ended up doing these things myself over the course of the past few weeks. This does not please me, and it certainly doesn't please my dogs.   In my almost 15 years of having a schnauzer groomed, I have never had a groomer blatantly ignore my requests AND give my dogs such a horrible basic groom.  I have never thought that my dogs were ugly before - but Smelly Dog managed to make them as ugly as two extremely cute dogs could possibly be.  I spent days literally crying about how awful they looked (these dogs are my babies).   To add insult to injury, the groom cost $15 more per dog than my regular groomer.   I will NEVER, EVER be going back to Smelly Dog. Ever. Ever. Ever.   Instead, I will be tucking my tail between my legs and sheepishly returning to my regular groomer - Jennifer at Trim Time in Mesa.  She is the best groomer the pups have ever had. Worth the drive, worth the time, worth every penny.

I LOVE Greek food.  Love.  I could eat greek/mediterranean food every day and be perfectly happy.    I do NOT love MBFGR.  I went to MBFGR for lunch with some of my co-workers.  3 of the 5 of us are vegetarians, and MBFGR has several veggie options.    I chose to have the "regular" sized greek salad.  It was the size of a dinner salad with iceberg lettuce, tomatos, feta, cucumbers, and greek dressing on the side.  It normally comes with onions and red peppers as well, but I didn't want them today.  It was a basic, run o' the mill greek salad, nothing special.    The dressing was good, but not spectacular.  It was definitely not made in-house (it had that egginess that store bought dressings sometimes have).  $12 for a side/dinner salad and a drink is too spendy.  It was good, but come on!  I would have rather spent my money on the dry grilled cheese from Tom's Tavern!    My lunch-mates had falafel, the veggie wrap, and a chicken wrap.  All thought the food was good.    Maybe I will order something else next time (but I hope there is no next time.)  Don't go here.  Go to Athenian Express instead.  If you are a vegetarian, get a Veggie Pita with a side of fries or a salad, and be happy.

We stopped by Switch the other night after getting raped by the IRS and while we were still feeling quite sad and pathetic.  We wanted something casual, inexpensive, and fast, and that is what we got!    Service was great!  We were one of maybe 3 inside tables and a full patio, and our waitress was fantastic.  She was very attentive and kept our drinks full.  We had the wedge fries, a weakness of mine, and they were pretty good.  Not great, but definitely good.  They had several vegetarian options, and I chose the Chop salad, which was SO yummy.  So yummy in fact, that I have been trying to duplicate it at home for days now.  My husband had the turkey berry sandwich, which I didn't try (no meat for me), but he said it was good.    We would definitely go there again. Try it!

I was so happy to discover 101 Bistro - just a short walk from home and an awesome alternative to driving all the way to Tempe for some Pita Jungle.    I had the Vegetarian Platter, which, IMHO, is WAY better than the Pita Jungle comparable plate, the Mediterranean Platter.  The dolmas were perfect, with cashews!  The hummus was slightly spicy, yum!  The Baba Ganoush was to die for.  I can't wait to go back.  YUM.

I feel like I have written a review for Purrfect Pawsitting before... but whatever. I am housecleaning today.   Anyway, I thought I had found exactly what we were looking for in a pet sitter when I came across Purrfect Pawsitting. I was so wrong. My husband and I happily used Jessika and Rachel several times for short trips to San Diego and Tucson... referred them to our family and friends, planned to use them forever. They started out so wonderful.   Then, we took a babymoon. I was 4 months pregnant, and we were saving every penny, but decided that we needed one last awesome vacation before he arrived. So, we booked ourselves a week in Seattle.   We left early one morning, and I asked in my standard "how to care for the dogs" note that R & J call us when they arrived. Going by their contract, I expected that to be prior to about 7pm (14 hours since our departure). 7pm passed, 8pm, 9pm (you get the picture). I called and called them. Several, increasingly panicky messages were left. By midnight, my husband and I were beside ourselves with worry - thinking our dogs had been inside (with no access to a bathroom) since 5am. We couldn't reach R & J by phone or email, and we were considering getting a flight home first thing in the morning (to the tune of thousands of dollars lost... ). We did not want to rely on our neighbors to care for our dogs for the entirety of our trip.   Finally, the next morning, I get a call. A somewhat bored, "what is your problem" kind of call, telling me that R & J had arrived around 8pm, then left again, to return after midnight.  Long story shorter, R & J did a half-assed job. They ruined an expensive non-stick pot with a metal fork. There was makeup all over the bathrooms, on the door handles, everywhere. The house was a mess. I would not feel comfortable leaving my dogs with them ever again after what happened, besides the fact that my house was a wreck when we got home. Nothing is worse than coming home from a long trip to a dirty house. Nothing. My only consolation is that I didn't come home to dead dogs or a house full of poop and pee - thank goodness for caring neighbors.   AND, after all that, Rachel & Jessika fired us! We were fired for expecting our dogs to be cared for in a reasonable and humane way. We were fired for relying on friends to care for our dogs when we couldn't reach the people we had paid to watch them.   I would never use R & J again. Never.

So, I grew up around horses... and (has anyone else noticed this?) the Rose and Crown has a smell that reminds me of a tack room.  Is this good or bad?  I do not know.  Fun for trivia, if a little crowded. Food is solid... but I would love to see some more vegetarian options. A girl can only eat so many grilled cheese sandwiches, you know.   Don't bother with dessert... they are clearly from the Costco freezer.

I had to revise my review - The Rose and Crown has revised their menu, and, my friends, it is not good.   I love me some pub trivia - my husband and I have been going for several years, and it is just fun! The Rose and Crown has the potential for some quality pub trivia time, but the latest MC sucks. Slow, horrifyingly bad at reading the questions, slow. Slow.   This would be redeemed by some decent food to keep us occupied, but alas, R & C's food is terrible. There is one single vegetarian option on the menu: Mixed greens with shredded cheese, terrible looking tomatoes, and cucumbers. The kind of salad that vegetarians make jokes about - seriously, R&C, you are mere blocks from the Downtown Phoenix Public Market, you have no excuses for the vegetable suckage.   If you ask for a grilled cheese (which is NOT on the menu), it comes with bacon - and is super greasy and disgusting (even when you ask them to remake you one without the bacon).   so, I am not really in a hurry to go back.

~~~~UPDATE~~~~ We went back to Breadfruit last night, and I must revise my original review to reflect our experience, which deserved more stars.  When we arrived at 7pm on Saturday night, the place was packed.  There wasn't enough room to push two tables together in order to accommodate our party of 4, so we walked around the block until some tables were open.  The waitress was extremely nice and we were seated about 20 minutes later.  For appetizers, we ordered the avocado spring rolls and the roasted plantains.  Despite being small portions, they were both very good.  I was inspired to go get some plantains in the Asian market this morning in order to try to make them at home.  As an entree, I ordered the curried tofu again.  I wanted to try something else (the Ital soup or the veggie patty), but they were out of a vital component of each dish, and they don't make the soup in the summer.  When my entree came out, I was initially really disappointed to see that they had made it with chicken, again.  I asked the waitress and she assured me that what I was seeing was actually a soy product and I had nothing to worry about.  I must say, it was disturbingly, uncomfortably meat-like.  So much so that I made my husband try it and tell me that it was in fact non-meat before I would put it in my mouth.  When I did eat it, it even had the texture of meat - very disconcerting.  The flavor was excellent, and I would definitely order this entree again - if I can get over the extremely realistic meat analog.  The sides were good (definitely better flavor since last time), especially mixed with the curry sauce.  I have to issue a heartfelt apology to Wayne and The Breadfruit for the disparaging review that I wrote after my last visit.  I should have called to ask about the dish and had them clarify that my dish was, in fact, fake meat.  It has been so long since I ate chicken (and I don't generally eat fake meat), that I truly thought it was meat.  (Lesson:  Don't assume anything!)  My dinner companions all ordered a chicken dish, and all enjoyed them thoroughly.  I tried the festivals (breadstick) from someone's meal, and I have to say that Breadfruit should offer a basket of those as an appetizer.  Yum.  When we were almost finished with our meal, the waitress brought us full sized samples of the carrot juice.  Another Yum!  It tasted a lot like Thai Iced tea - similar seasonings, and very rich and creamy.    I will definitely go back to Breadfruit.  The food was good (Festivals=crack), the atmosphere and the service is EXCELLENT, and it is close to home.    Home Run, Breadfruit.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Downtown Phoenix NEEDS a Jamaican restaurant (and an Ethiopian, Italian, Mexican, etc), and I have waited anxiously for Breadfruit to open - riding my bike by there every afternoon for weeks looking for any sign of life.    Finally, just this week, I see people eating there.  So, we went for lunch today ( at 12:45... at the end of the lunch rush), of course, we arrived at the exact same moment  as Phil Gordon.   I think we threw them off a little bit by ordering our meal to go, but they don't get a by for that.  The wait was long (35 minutes), but they were really busy, and they just opened, and the mayor was there, so it was understandable.  We forgave.  The lone waiter brought me a Fiji water, It tided me over slightly.  I was excited to see several "vegan" options on the menu - mostly sides, but it looks like some of the entrees can be modified to fit vegetarian requirements.    I ordered the curried tofu (that is the name printed on the menu, no modifications!), which comes with sides of steamed plantains, beans/rice, and steamed cabbage/green bell peppers.  Unfortunately, I recieved curried chicken, a fact that I discovered after getting back to my office... and I was WAY too starving to go back to get it fixed.  I ate around the chicken, something I am normally loathe to do... but as I said, STARVING.  The beans and rice = bland.  Nothing spectacular, they were just that: beans and rice.  Plantains = undercooked.  Just slightly.  I wanted them to be so much better than they were.  Cabbage/Green Bell pepper = boring.  They were just steamed cabbage and green pepper.  I love cooked cabbage, but with salt please!  Nothing that I ate was seasoned at all.  I had bite or two of the curry sauce since it was touching the rice (starving!), and it tasted ok... am I allowed to pass judgement on a sauce that was poured over something I don't ever eat (because I think it is disgusting)?  Its hard to say.  Admittedly, I would have enjoyed this meal A LOT more if I had recieved a meal that did not contain meat.    I will probably go back... Breadfruit is new, and they deserve another chance.  I will definitely eat in, and I will try David's reccomendation of the avocado rolls.  One strike.  They haven't struck out just yet.

Wow, Chill rocks. Frank and his lovely wife, the proprietors, are fantastic. The prices are super low and the gelato/sorbet is awesome. While we were there, a little kid dropped the top part of his cone on the ground. Frank replaced it for free.   Then he gave us a sample of the fat-free, sugar-free chocolate sorbet, which made me want to buy a pint of it... after I had already eaten a baby sized Mango/Pomegranate mix. Yum.   How about this: Go have dinner/lunch/breakfast/whatever at Pita Jungle, then walk across the parking lot to Chill for dessert. That sounds like the perfect evening.

Top Shelf is what I call "Mexican Comfort Food."  It's the kind of Mexican food that I grew up with - cheesy, sorta greasy, good food.  Their enchilada sauce is killer.  It is definitely the kind of place you go to when you want a good, solid meal - it isn't WOW, but it isn't bad.    I heard once that the sign of a good Mexican food is good beans - Top Shelf has them.  I never asked if they are vegetarian... at the time, I didn't want to know. (so they probably aren't)  Go to Top Shelf.  Not on a first date, but on the 4th or 5th, when you want a good meal without any pretention.  Yum.

I really, really loved Humble Pie. They make the kind of pizza that Sauce aspires to in it's deepest fantasies.   Seriously - We split two: Artichoke and Potato. they were SO. GOOD. Just what I want from a pizza - wood fired, creamy, crusty, yummy.   We also split some fries... Get these. Just do it.   The service was decent, but we went at a weird time - there was hardly anyone there.   Humble Pie: Please open a location downtown.

I didn't really want to write this review because I like to think that Gallo is my little secret restaurant - and while I would like it to stay that way, I also want them to be successful.   I think Gallo might be my favorite restaurant.  The hubs and I go all the time, take our out of town friends, family, etc. We (and no one that we have taken) have never been disappointed. Our Tucsonan friends ask to go every time they are in town (and heaven knows that Tucson isn't lacking in the fantastic Mexican fare).   I am a vegetarian, and while I am predisposed to love a Mexican place that has vegetarian options, Gallo truly earns my love.   The house salad is AMAZING. Perfect. It is so good, I could eat one every day. They must put crack in the dressing or something. The beans are good, fries are good, stir fried veggies are amazing. Everything I have tried is good. My husband (a non-vegetarian) has tried almost everything on the menu, and hasn't spoken an ill word about any of it.   Here is where I admit that I am a hypocrite: I tried the fish tacos - halibut at the time. (Hey, I am pregnant, and I wanted a bite. I can't be denied.) Best fish ever (not that I am an expert on the subject or anything), even though I felt supremely guilty about it afterward.  Anyway, I hate to encourage you to go to Gallo... so go try it, just not when I want to go, so Gallo can maintain super-secret restaurant status in my mind.
