DESSERTS ARE AMAZING! I have gotten addicted to Tammy Co cupcakes thanks to LGO! I keep coming back! Knowing that their staff is going to greet me with a smile and always ready to aid me and answer my questions is another reason I keep coming back.   You ABSOLUTELY HAVE to try their Tammy Co red velvet cupcakes. They are to DIE for!  You will find yourself day dreaming about them. Their other desserts have also been tasty and their cakes so cute, crafty and UNIQUE! If you're looking for an artsy cake in a unique design THIS IS YOUR PLACE!  Its always fun wandering around and finding random little nick nacks for yourself, friends and family!

UPDATE: after my last experience with Fiesta Burrito I have to say I AM NEVER GOING BACK. Why? I asked for a California burrito with guacamole, got charged for the guacamole, but it was never in my burrito. The burrito seemed to shrink 10% more than the last time I thought it shrank. It was definitely not worth the price at all. I  also got charged for an extra drink. When I went back to ask for my refund for the guacamole and the extra drink I was charged for the men just looked at me like I was crazy. He offered me a cup instead (which I didn't need I already had my drink) and I saw one man in the back filling up a tiny cup of guacamole (which I didn't need either because I had already eaten the tiny burrito) All I wanted was my $3.00 back for things I never received.     this place is always my go-to place for fast late night Mexican Food (only when Tacos Jalisco is closed) cleaner also. I know I wont have to worry about cockroaches roaming my food. I love how theyre so fast, and the food comes out tasting decent.  what I am concerned about is how small their burritos have gotten over the years. don't get me wrong, theyre still beasts, but they have definitely shrank in width. i know regulars would agree. their customer service is a bit lacking, so don't feel bad if theyre not attentive and don't exactly cater to your needs. you have to tell them if you want any extras and other customizations.    regardless, this is the place to go for super fast delicious Mexican food, that wont make you sick! PARTY burrito!

This is the place I go to religiously when I'm feeling like eating healthy. Being a pesceterian, I frequently get meat cravings, and GREEN is the place I run to. Their mock chicken is delicious, tasted just like real chicken, and their version of the Big Mack the "Big Wack" is even tastier than the real thing, from what I can remember! I absolutely recommend the spicy peanut chicken salad, it is so filling and full of flavor. To whoever judges vegan food as "cardboard- like and tasteless" needs to try Green. I have gotten several of my omnivorous friends to try this place and they have all loved the food and the atmosphere. Its very artsy-fartsy inside, and when you walk in you immediately feel the positive vibes bouncing off all the healthy people inside. Its really really nice overall. The location is a little hidden, but nevertheless, when you find the place you will always go back!  STAY GREEN!

If you're into authentic Mexican food this is the place for you! You're taste buds will have a party when they grab a sample of their unique flavor. All their food tastes AMAZING. Bold marinated carne asada, lemony fresh cevice, spicy yummy menudo, I have NO COMPLAINTS regarding their food it is WONDERFUL. The only downside is this place is tiny and the location is a bit on the bad side. The employees aren't rude but theyre not super friendly either. Regardless, I believe the food speaks for itself!

Sushi is my favorite food, needless to say I drove all the way from Scottsdale to eat at Akihana. In comparison to the other sushi places I've been to, the prices cannot be beat! We ordered about 8 rolls that day, most on their specialty menu, and I have to say they were quite delicious! Creative too! Their presentation is quite unique! They turn some of the rolls into little character (such as the caterpillar roll).   My favorite thing about this place is that they are not cheap when rolling their rolls! They come packed with fish and goodies and are a more than average size, which is GREAT for the already cheap price you pay and, of course, for your belly!   You can never leave this place hungry!   The location is a bit sketchy, the customer service is good but not great or excellent, and the place inside isn't all that great, but I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this place to anyone! Very tasty and your wallet will love it!

Walking inside the place I noticed how the overall atmosphere of it is very 50's 60's. the decour inside Complimenting the atmosphere!   We were not greeted by anyone and it took them about 4/5 mins to meet our server. When she did come over she was quite nice and brought out drinks out right away.  My boyfriend ordered biscuits and gravy and I got a tuna salad Sandwich. The biscuits and gravy were delicious! Tasted very homemade and full of flavor! The sandwich was good as well very large portion, Definitely moneys worth.    I plan on going back and trying their burgers!    The service wasn't all that great but not terrible either... The food was tasty and fairly priced!

This place is DELICIOUS! Everything from the customer service to the food itself is just 100% amazing!   I am personally obsessed with their ahi tuna wonton cups, everyone should try them :) their choices are more healthy than other similar locales and put together with a great staff, the place is just wonderful.   I definitely recommend this place to everyone!

Sushi is my favorite food, with that being said I've had about every sushi place you can think of in the Scottsdale area. This is so far my favorite I've had! Their sashimi is SO FRESH I feel like they have an ocean right outside the locale. The way their sushi is categorized is also very helpful they have a section for the spicy rolls and the non spicy rolls along with chef specials that you can choose whether you want spicy or non!  Prices- AMAZING. Seeing that everything was so cheap, I was a bit skeptical to try it. I've never had decently priced sushi that actually tasted phenomenal. yes, PHENOMENAL, sooooooo fresh and you can differentiate each individual roll because it each has its own unique flavor.   The staff is super friendly, the sushi chef always remembers me, and they have a great atmosphere. DEFINITELY recommend this place. MY favorite sushi place. I would drive from anywhere to acquire that fresh taste. AMAZING!

I walked in and no one greeted me... Probably didn't know I was even inside. After I ordered my sandwich, I asked the employee helping me, Carissa, for 6 cookies. It must've been too much to ask for because she tossed the cookies at me. I politely asked for a bag to put them in and she angrily put the cookies in the bag then shoved the bag towards me like "here, get out of here"... After I paid I kindly asked for her name, and I promised never to come to this subway on pinnacle peak EVER again.

I am a frequent visitor of this place because I enjoy the positive energy and the artsy, inspirational vibes. Everytime I go I order an iced chai latte which is always prompt and DELICIOUS! I always go for seconds. There was once I received a watered down tea at the same time I got bad customer service, but I believe it was the individual that was helping me out, and I havn't seen him since. Other than that, all the pastries I've tried are delicious, their dirty chais are2 AMAZING, the location is beautiful, and the staff is friendly. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone that enjoys a little hipster coffee time fun, whether it be doing work, homework, or playing a nice game of scrabble. THIS PLACE ROCKS!!!

I am a food enthusiast, so when I read its reviews on good ol' yelp I thought it would be a great idea to by a groupon and check it out. The decour of the place is beautiful and very well maintained, but as I walked in my boyfriend and I kinda didn't know what to do so we stood around waited to be greeted. We were sat by a super polite host who told us our server would be with us shortly. The place was not busy at all, we were 1 of 3 couples in the whole area, and you can bet it took the server SEVENTEEN (17) minutes to come greet us and offer us water and suggestions. I did time it because my boyfriend and I were about to walk out of the locale.   I ordered the specialty salmon and my boyfriend a burger. The salmon was lacking flavor and the side rice was nothing out of the ordinary. My boyfriend enjoyed the burger but he said it was nothing special.   I have to give it to them on the drinks. We had the specialty drink with absinthe in it and it was quite tasty! I would still recommend this place because the atmosphere is quite nice and their specialty drinks are delicious.   If they stepped up their customer service they would be amazing. Maybe it was because I was using a groupon? Regardless you should never treat potential guests poorly, it drives service away. I tipped 100% ($20) and even with the groupon my tab was $40. I promise you if the customer service was better and prompt I would a regular there. The place is nice!

UPDATE: I absolutely LOVE this place and have to admit I feel a little down writing about the last 2 experiences I've had, considering how I've become a die-hard regular. In hopes that you will not go through the same experience, I am writing this more as a warning. My boyfriend and I walked in there on a Saturday evening, we were greeted right away, as usual, by the kind Asian man, who we believe is the owner. We sat at  our usual high-top table, and waited...waited... waited for about 7 minutes (very unusual) for our server to greet us and bring us menus. When we came over, we immediately realized it was the same waiter we had the last time we had a negative experience. With no enthusiasm he brought us menus and left. Didn't offer us a drink until the second time he came around. After he brought us our drinks he went about his runs, and forgot about us. Finally, he came back to our table and ASSUMED we wanted the sashimi combo and was about to run to put it in when we quickly told him we were trying new things. We put in an appetizer (Salmon Kama), and 4 other rolls. Everyone else brought us our food instead of our waiter. What ENRAGED me is that I saw him SMOKING OUT OF AN E-CIGARETTE PEN BY THE BAR!!!! Also, we NEVER got our appetizer. Apparently, the waiter never put it in seeing that the Asian man had to ask us what we ordered. When the Salmon Kama came out, it was DISGUSTING. My boyfriend said it tasted as if they microwaved leftover fish and put it on a plate with cabbage. I have to agree. Only the times we've gotten this server (whom I don't even know his name, Hispanic looking man, with lots of arm tattoos and spiky hair) have been the times we have had bad service, his tip showed how unsatisfied we were, I even wrote him a little comment. Hopefully this will make him fix his style of waitoring to prevent driving customers away.  Aside those incidents, the place is still AMAZING.    what separates BEI from the surrounding sushi restaurants is their fish. I am always searching for good-tasting sushi spots where you can actually distinguish the fish by taste not just by sight. their fish is excellent, and tastes super fresh. comparable to several upscale sushi restaurants in Miami.   simply because of taste, I would choose this place over any of the chains in the Scottsdale area. their customer service is also impressive. everyone, including the owner, are extremely attentive and welcome you enthusiastically. they make sure to ask how your food tasted, and are open for suggestions. you can tell they're in the business because they love Japanese food and the art of sushi, not just to make money and turn it into a chain.   the only thing "fishy" (no pun intended) is the area. its located in a shopping strip in south Scottsdale that looks a bit shady during the day, a reason why it took me a little longer to try the place out. I was a bit skeptical.  inside is a different story. its very clean, well-maintained and you can tell they put in some work to remodel the place.  their specials are amazing as well! they have a few of their specialty rolls as part of their specials and their portions are never skimped. you need to try the BLAZING ALASKA ROLL its definitely my favorite roll on their happy hour menu.  if you're a sushi enthusiast, you MUST try this place. I guarantee it becomes one of your favorites
