This review is for the take-out window at the original Red Devil restaurant. I grew up in this neighborhood and have come here since I was a wee lass. I remember begging my mom to get out of the car so I could stand in front of the pick-up window and "help" her carry the pizza to the car.   I still come here because the pizza is amazing, they always have a large cheese & wings combo on special, they make their own super-chunkily-creamy-delicious bleu cheese dressing and the guys who work at the pick-up window are super-sweet (even when it's blazing hot outside, and inside, near the ovens). Sure, you have to remember a random number they give you at a moment where you'll never be able to find a pen or something to write with in order to pick up your order (like Carolina's), but it's still my favorite pizza complete with a chewy, delicious crust. Enjoy.

Ok...if the market sandwich of the day is the BLT, order it. It will make you weak. Otherwise, I am faithful to the Mozzerella, Tomato, Basil...either as a sandwich in their chewy lovely bread or prepared as a salad (with a bit of his signature crusty loaf on the side.) I've also never gone wrong ordering their fresh fruit, the watermelon with a squeeze of fresh lemon is wonderfully refreshing when it's in season. Add a little somethin' somethin' from LUX next door and you'll be rubbing your belly and getting your three wishes fulfilled all at the same time.

Veggie pasty. Old Peculiar. HP Sauce. A side of darts. Try and get those things together anywhere else in Phoenix. I dare you. 'Nuff said.

Oooh, see, no one told me Luke's does Chicago Style hot dogs. I went there a couple of months ago to try the dripping beef sandwiches that everyone is raving about. Ok, normally I'm a big fan of anything beef-related, but that type of sandwich is more targeted toward my dad, not me. However, the Chicago Style hot dogs are absolutely delicious. I also love the presentation...they wrap up the hot dog with a sheet of paper, and drop the fries inside the packet and roll everything up. It looks like a wrapped burrito. The staff was amazing, as well. Very friendly.

Best women's bathroom ever. Plus, if you're looking for a place where you will be able to talk to the owner, order a great drink and feel absolutely, completely at home...this is the place. Diverse crowd, lots of interesting music on the jukebox (my friend chose Neil Diamond, Bob Marley, Fleetwood Mac and ABBA among other things the last time we came) and a really sweet midwestern vibe. Enjoy!

I'm a big fan of Dick's Hideaway...but not a huge fan of Richardson's. There's something about all of that tacky Southwestern decor at Richardson's that makes me lose my appetite. Rokerij (pronounced ro-ka-ree) has all of the charm and coziness of Dick's without any of the tackiness of Richardson's.   The food is different, too--it's an Amsterdam smokehouse theme. You'll still find specials written on chalk boards in the dining areas, so bring your glasses if you're near-sighted. My favorite dish is the tenderloin on a toast, covered with peppercorn gravy. The Rokerij salad is delicious--a version of the classic wedge sprinkled with chunks of bleu cheese, red onion and bacon.  If you're looking for some fantastic appetizers, order the small plates--the toasts with melted brie and tenderloin are great. It's a nice place to bring clients for lunch, but it would also make for an intimate first date. Great beers on tap if you don't want to check out their more than adequate wine list. I think it's the same menu for lunch and dinner. Both the main dining room (on the ground floor) and the basement bar come equipped with fireplaces and comfy furniture with those signature toss pillows. Warning: if you're wearing a skirt and you have to slide into the ultrasuede booth, you're going to show some leg. You can reserve either of the booths in the bar area if you have a larger group and want to make sure you have a seat.

I love Mama Java's. They have free WiFi, every Sunday night they have a Bluegrass jam session and their coffee drinks, chais and teas are excellent.   But, what makes me adore them is what I experienced during one visit. The night before, I had put my debit card, cash and ID in my pocket to go to a show, and forgot to transfer them back to my wallet.  I didn't realize this until I had placed and received my order. The woman behind the counter said "don't worry about it, you win some and you lose some" and then the woman behind me offered to pay for my drink. I dug into my wallet and gave them all of the change I had, which probably amounted to 32 cents. You gotta love a place where everyone is invested in making sure you get your caffeine fix.

Stumpy's is a family-owned restaurant just off the 51 Freeway and Northern. I love them. They have a zany-garlicky homemade house Italian dressing to top their crunchy salads. Yes, they told me you can buy it by the bottle, if you end up loving it as much as I do. Their pizza? Delicious crust, tons of cheese and generous toppings. Their baked wings? Tangy and delicious, perfect for dipping into their homemade bleu cheese dressing. Even though they are normally crazy-busy on a Friday night, they still called my cell just to make sure I received my order and enjoyed it. Online ordering, too. http://pizzabystumpys.com/  Just go. (Closed on Sundays.)

Recommend. Came in during my lunch hour on a whim and was extremely happy with the result. $20 ($17+tip) for a leg massage/pedi. The woman who was giving me the pedicure was so sweet and welcoming. Love her. Will definitely be back.

Carolina's is simply great. They have Jamaica flavored drink in the fountain dispenser (it's red, it's tangy and it's delish), the creamiest refried beans you've ever experienced (lard-a-rific), hot ginormous fresh flour tortillas that melt in your mouth, chorizo that makes me buy it on impulse and freeze it for Carolina-free Sundays or long trips, and hot sauce so good it makes me crave it fortnightly. Oh, and if you've had a variation of the rolled tacos (flautas) at any of the local "-betos" in the Valley, you must try the Carolina's version...you'll never go back. But, my favorite thing on the menu is the astounding bean, potato and cheese burrito. The very definition of perfection.  Sure, it's in South Phoenix down the street from where one of my childhood friends grew up (and the original Food City), sure it's always crazy busy so you sometimes have to park up the street and wait in a line that extends the end of the restaurant. (Uh, Saturdays and anytime around lunch time during the week are especially busy.) But, I'm sorry, in my opinion you haven't eaten Mexican food in Phoenix unless you've come here.

If you're like us, you bring about three bottles of wine and two six packs of beer for dinner (yes, we're the loud ones packed out at the big table.) Justina is great, always has an amazing pair of Nordstrom shoes on every time I see her and I feel like family when I visit her restaurant. The green beans are worth the price of admission alone (yes, I admit, I will sometimes order enough of the appetizer portions so I can eat green beans for dinner and nothing else.) The other options are delightful, too. Always a wait, but if you have a large party, don't hesitate to call the day of and make a reservation. She can usually fit you in.

I went into Books looking for a specific book by a fairly obscure British author and ended up finding a first edition copy for $13. I love this store. It's one of those places you can get lost in, looking at mysteries for 30 minutes then travel books for the next hour then vintage books for another 20 minutes. Endless selection in almost every genre. If you love books, you'll love Books.

Since moving to Sunnyslope, I've been on the lookout for good neighborhood restaurants. I'm very happy to have stumbled upon this place. The Eye Opener feels like a small-town diner and is surprisingly large inside. Everyone was incredibly friendly and the food was outstanding. I ordered the chicken fried steak, eggs and hash browns. The hash browns were sliced, sort of like thick potato chips and fried. The gravy on the chicken fried steak contained large chunks of sausage and was full of flavor, and my eggs were perfect. My meal came with two biscuits, as well. I don't think I was hungry for the rest of the day. So good, will definitely be back.

TT has a British biker theme, think Triumph Motorcycle circa-1960. They have a lot of great alternative and British music on the jukebox (The Clash, Rancid.) The bartenders are the best, so friendly and sweet. Have you ever been spontaneously hugged by a bartender you've never met before? It's happened to me here.   Even though the bathrooms are small, for the record, five of my friends fit in there at one time. (It actually caused quite a stir in the bar...sending one of the disbelieving male regulars over to check on us. This entertained me greatly.)   There are few places like it in the Valley. Highly recommended.

I love the Spa at Camelback Inn. I'm one of those annoying "I wonder if the facilities are modern" types. The spa is great. I've never been to a spa before, probably because I thought spending that much money on a treatment couldn't possibly be justified in any universe. How wrong I was. The fact that I wore a retro bathing suit and a robe all day long was enough. But, then there were the fluffy towels. Ginormous jacuzzi. Steam bath that smelled of eucalyptus. The fluffy towels. The sauna. The fluffy towels. The pool. The patio (I think it was called something else...) where you could lounge or nap or eat apples and drink tea like my friend and I did. The massage. Did I mention the endless supply of tea and fluffy towels? Seriously, I want to pack all of my furniture and move in. Next weekend works for me, I saw a space next to the jacuzzi that looked open.

Frasher's (pronounced Fraisier's) is a great place to hang out--though it's not your typical Scottsdale destination. The owners have an interesting taste in decor (interesting=questionable. Note the leather couch on the patio.) But, I like it, so it's ok with me. Happy hour? Excellent. Half price on already cheap appetizers and good pours on the drinks. The bartenders? I want to miniaturize them, put them in my pocket and carry them around with me everywhere. Even the 'grouchy' one makes me peal in laughter. The food? It's St. Louis themed, plenty of meat, the salmon is smoked on premises and is delicious, in fact, everything I've had is excellent. If you're from St. Louis, and you're jonesing for pizza topped with all of that signature cheese, drop everything and head over. I've heard this is one of the few places you can find it. I'm always surprised at the variety of people here and how little I've spent during happy hour when I walk out the door.  Dinner can be a little pricey, but you can order anything off the menu at the bar so it might be a good place to start.

I came here on the opening night when someone from Gin Blossoms played on a makeshift stage, the beers were 25 cents and there was no food (but you know me, we ordered a pizza from a neighborhood pizza place.) Since then, they have added a full kitchen and the food is amazing (chicken strips that were designed for diners who appreciate tempura-like batter and are over the age of four), the beer is astounding (one word: Kolsch...makes me swoon) and the people are great. It's worth the walk wherever you end up finding a space to park--even better, ride your bike over like we do! The Sunday brunch is great. All of my friends sit and wish they had a student loan that would enable them to spend at least half of the day drinking here daily. I don't blame them.

Lalibela was lovely. The staff was superb and friendly and the food, particularly the fosolia, was delicious. I tried the number 17 on the menu, which was a sampler of three dishes. One lamb, one beef and one vegetarian. The flavors on the lamb and beef dish were pretty similar, but it might have just been the combination I ordered.   The injera was very spongy and sour, like sourdough bread. We all commented on the fact that it was very filling, so I recommend you use sparingly to start. Even though they recommend trying three entrees, I would probably have been happy and filled to capacity with two. I also enjoyed a tasty Ethiopian beer called Bedele. It was really hoppy, but good. Overall, a great experience. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying more vegetarian dishes.

I discovered this place through a lacto-ovo vegetarian friend. He wouldn't stop talking about it. It was annoying. To shut him up, I took him there and tentatively ordered the spicy buffalo wings. Uh, freaking amazing. The garlicky hot wing sauce is insanely good and the texture of the tofu/mushroom mixture is so eerily chicken your mind will do a double-take. Now I've gone back and ordered almost everything on the menu. Mock crab puffs (delicious). Spicy peanut mock chicken salad. Coconut curry. Mongolian with mock beef. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the tsoynami I ordered...the texture of the chocolate peanut butter smoothie was funky, it wasn't sweet enough for me and they forgot I ordered it and had to ask twice. Otherwise, all is excellent. Interesting crowd: some nights the local tai chi chapter visits, but you will always find a nice mix of people who probably never wear leather shoes. Gotta respect that. Go somewhere else if you want wine with your mock chicken parmesan, they don't serve alcohol here. But, then again, try to find mock chicken parmesan anywhere else...

Wow. Yeah, this isn't really my place. Lots of karaoke. Lots of weirdness. Not so bueno. I was in the bathroom and overheard two women discuss loudly the fact that their boyfriends had very specific physical problems which I would have preferred never having to overhear. The bartenders are nice, the regulars not so much. No Bombay Sapphire and the bartenders didn't even notice they had a Bombay dry gin getting dusty in the corner when I requested the Sapphire version.  I admit, I got out of here in a hurry. Probably won't be coming back.

This place is soul squared. There's nothing finer than an evening starting with a long conversation with a complete stranger at Bar Bianco, followed by an antipasto platter, then a Biancoverde with a layer of buttery proscuitto piled on top. Bring me a pint of cream ale and I'm in heaven. If Dave brings it to me, even better. Crusty, cheesy, salty, splendid heaven.

Durant's is an icon. Every photographer in Phoenix can show you at least one portrait of a political figure or celebrity they have shot in these hallowed (red flocked) walls. Every single person you come into contact with as you walk through the kitchen into the restaurant says hello to you. I just have one more thing to say: when you order a beer at the bar it comes topped with a toothpick skewered with meat and cheese. Respect.

Yeah, well, like I need to review LUX. Either you love acid green or you hate it. Ditto with the atmosphere of LUX. I personally adore Dave, one of the excellent baristas who moonlights as a photo assistant when he isn't making perfect Americanos. It's very hipster, very busy, the DJs have computers, but let's not kid ourselves...everyone in the place does (Mac, OS 10.5.2, in fact). The pastries, scones and other delights have no protective glass covering, bake sale style (unless they are frosted cupcakes, which drives one of my friends CRAZY because he's a bit of a germaphobe). The yogurt parfaits are probably the best I've had. Maple? Oh. So. Good. If you want to meet a writer, this is the place to go. If you want to avoid a writer or other creative individual, well, you probably will want to order an unusual soda pop at Pané next door and call it a day. Mmmm, I can totally smell the coffee grinding as I write this. They recently changed up their tea and it's delightful, particularly with a squirt of Agave nectar. Agave nectar or not, never a dull moment.

Ok, PB (Pizzeria Bianco) will always be my first love. Yes, I'm one of those. But, if you're craving pizza but are entirely over a 3.5 hour wait, definitely drive over to Cibo. Their four cheese pizza is incredible. Really. Their patio (in good weather) is lovely, too. Great place to bring someone on a date, or with a small group of friends who don't mind sitting on rickety chairs. If you're craving pizza for lunch, go somewhere else, only salads and sandwiches available midday.

Just a disclaimer: I've never actually stepped into Tammie Coe's bakery. However, I am able to convince someone I work with (through the power of suggestion and my magnetic personality) to drive over and pick up coconut cupcakes from their Roosevelt location on a regular basis. They are a-maz-ing.   I had my first bite of the said cupcake at Lisa G's and have been hooked since. Try one, and you will be jonesing for a fix in no time.   P.S. No, you can't have my friend's number so you can have her pick you up one, too. Nice try.

Ahhhh, Shady's. Never a dull moment, or a dull conversation. There's always a nice mix of people here, I've met lovely Chandler garbage men and insane New Times freelance writers. Dig the Tim Biskup painting in the corner and their jukebox isn't bad, either.

Lots of fascinating items fill the space (retro clothing, furniture, and stereo equipment to name a few) to keep you busy. Might be best if you're not on a mission to purchase something in particular, because the outrageously oversized cat-eye specs hanging from the ceiling may distract you from your goal. The owner is kind and engaging.

You had me at outdoor bocce court. Seriously. But, the basic hamburger is great, freshly ground beef, always tender and juicy. I dig the Vings. Any time I order a double Bombay Sapphire gin and tonic, it's tasty and refreshing. The waitstaff are always helpful and kind. The environment is retro cool. The back patio is relaxing and spontaneous at the same time. Bottles of wine are half price on Sundays. Good basic stuff. But, did I mention the bocce? Crazy, man, crazy.

Mmmmm, I like this place. First off, it's a small restaurant that feels more like a bar. My friend and I showed up, each ordered Hoegaarden draught and analyzed the menu. The choices were staggering. We decided to order a traditional and vegetarian pasty--and split them. The pasties are huge, the fillings are fresh and tasty. If you sit at the bar, you will see them preparing and baking your order while you watch. They have extra HP sauce on order (one of my favorite condiments in the universe), if you wish to dip your pasty into tangy deliciousness. All in all, I'll be back for more. Definitely.

I enjoy this place. My friend brought me one of their business cards and we were both oohing and ahhing over the design (we're nerds.) At my first opportunity, I drove downtown and ordered one of their signature drinks. It was delicious and the staff are very friendly and welcoming. Drink in hand, I sat outside and caught up on some reading. There's plenty of downtown flavor in this neighborhood, think you'll enjoy it.

Market Bistro is a nice place to grab lunch. I tried the Arizona Salad, as my friend spoke about it as though it was the holy grail and she was one of the Knights Templar. It was pretty good. Next time, I would probably ask they didn't add a full cup of hot peppers to the salad, but otherwise outstanding. I'm always excited when someone adds salt to my salad, especially when using tongs (fancy move!) as I'm a salt-o-holic.   It's set up similar to Paradise Bakery, in that you can have pretty much anything added to your salad or sandwich that you want. Fresh pizzas to order, as well. They also have yummy baked goods and delicious iced tea.

Don't say blinds again. If you don't know what I'm talking about, then you haven't been to Red Hot Robot.   Yes, it's in the same brilliant corner of Camelback and Central as Frances, Stinkweeds, Halo, Slippery Pig, and Cowtown Skateboards. I think there's a Dairy Queen and a meat store on the end should you desire a dairy or protein filled snack while you're buying Tokyo toys, frilly panties, the latest Arcade Fire, increasing the size of your gauges, getting your bike serviced by someone even more obsessed with your bike than you are and checking out the latest Stereo board. But, I digress.  RHR is simply the best new store in Phoenix. It doesn't hurt that the amazingly insightful Jason owns and runs it. Don't forget to buy the latest Ugly Doll, Amanda Visell vinyl, David Horvath (Bossy Bear, anyone?), Gama Go anything and a myriad of sweet items you will only find here.  Accept no imitations.  But, beware: buy one blind and you'll be addicted and be writing raving reviews of it, too.

Horrid.   I will occasionally determine whether I will attend a show based whether my love for the band outweighs my disdain for the Clubhouse. Some key points, in no particular order: staggeringly hot--I left the Walkmen show early because I thought I was going to pass out. (When the band onstage complains that it's hot, they're probably not just making conversation...) Horrible sound, especially if you are forced to stand in front of the speakers, which is hard to avoid. Bathrooms? Stifling, inadequate and revolting. Beer sign that shines into the crowd and distracts from the acts on stage? Annoying. Random discarded yard sale items stored in the bar area? Really? Ever heard of a storage room? The fact that you have to stand by the sticky-floored bar area far away from the stage if you're drinking? Ridiculous.   Why do bands play here? One of the great mysteries of the universe. Especially when there are places like the Rhythm Room nearby. The only positive thing I have to say is the guys they have staffed at the front door are always friendly.  Added bonus: hope you enjoy taking your friend to the impound lot (it's across the street from Tempe Marketplace) because more than one of my friends has been towed from this lot before. So, if there's a sign warning you will be towed over the space you're parking in, believe it.

I'm obsessed with tea, particularly of the black variety. Souvia allows you to try different kinds of tea, either hot or iced. They have two flavors of tea (one of each temperature) available each day on the counter if you wish to pour your own. If you're someone like me who prefers freshly brewed iced tea, they will brew to order and put it in a 32oz. container to-go for the same price as a small pot. The teas are priced and sold by weight in grams, and you can store the tea in a handy bag (free) or tin (price varies depending on size).  My favorite loose leaf tea they sell is called Afternoon Delight, and it smells like ambrosia, the drink of the gods. It's one of their tastiest black teas, in my opinion. (It's somewhat similar to Lady Londonberry, sold at Tealuxe in Boston.)  Be prepared for a bit of a wait (just in case you get behind someone who's purchasing an elaborate gift basket and has to smell every single tea in the store in the process), but otherwise excellent service. It's probably not what you would think of as a traditional tea house, as it's spartan inside without the traditional floral curtains, frilly aprons and cozies. But, I think it's still nice, in a Japanese modern type of way.

Freshly baked bread. Honey-glazed chocolate croissants. Freshly sliced proscuitto all wrapped up in lovely paper packets. Extra Virgin Olive Oil. If I could live on these four items for the rest of my life, and they were from Andreolis, I would.   This restaurant is set up a bit like a high-end deli, where you can order freshly made pastries and breads, cheeses, meats (I've heard rumor that Gianni cures his own salami...ask), olives and stock up on hard to find Italian grocery items. I always stop here when I'm on my way to picnic at the Northern Arizona wineries. However, you can also order full meals brought to a table in a rustic dining room that feels like home. The patatine e porri fritti (fried potatoes and leeks) is one of my favorite things on the menu. Purchase a bottle of white wine or a bottle of bubbly Italian soda, and you're good to go. If you speak Italian, you'll feel right at home. Everyone here does.   It also doesn't hurt that there's an urban legend that Chris Bianco worked for Gianni Andreoli a long time ago in a land far, far away. (Babbo Ganzo in Santa Fe.)   Enjoy!

Just found out Andrioli also carries hard-to-find and incredibly tasty Amerena Cherries: $16.99 for a 8 oz. container. P.S. My friend Sammy bought the rest of the stock out the last week in December, so if you're looking for cherries, too, call before you drive over.

If you have ever wanted to do kettle bells, weight lifting, rowing, rings, and then hit a tractor tire with a sledge hammer all in the same workout, this is the place to go. The space is very industrial, very raw. Ken (the owner and personal trainer) is great and will push you further than you have ever gone before--no matter what your fitness level. I've worked out with hockey players and weight lifters (BTW, I am neither and am probably the most uncoordinated person on the planet) and have never done the same workout twice. If you're looking for something new to challenge yourself, attain a particular skill level or qualify for the police academy, look no further.

Los Reyes de la Torta has watermelon aguas frescas as big as your head, and gigantic platters of carne asada that put any other establishment to shame. (The waitstaff also have impeccably teased hairstyles which I adore.)   If you go, it's a table service type of place. When you bring your check to the cashier to pay, you have the opportunity to pick your very own Dum-Dum lollipop as a parting gift. (Please leave me a Cherry Vanilla, they are my fave.)  I was holding off on reviewing one of my favorite neighborhood establishments in hopes of keeping the hungry hoardes away. But, as I heard the 'Slope's best torta place is being featured on Man vs. Food show on the Travel Network tonight, I figured it was time to finally toss my hat in the ring. See you there.

I stopped in here with a friend on a Friday night (who drove by about seven times, in seemlng disbelief that something so cool looking would be in this 'hood). The scene? People-wise, it felt a bit like I was walking into the middle of a country club wedding. In fact, there was one women with a pink sweater tied around her shoulders. I've heard I was there on an off night--but it was definitely a 40+ date night the night I came.   I'm told it's normally packed with a diverse and fun mixed crowd. There were some on the brilliant patio, which is complete with a red Vespa, comfy seating and a blazing fire pit. The wine and beer selection are focused primarily on South American and Latin American imports. I really enjoyed the Quilmes lager I ordered, it reminded me of some I've had on my visits to Costa Rica.  The live music was great and fit in well with the South American theme. There is a large 8-person table inside for larger parties, plus several smaller 2- and 4-person tables. Very cozy. For those who enjoy admiring their pink sweater ensembles, check out the gigantic oversized mirror. There is also a flat-screen TV on the wall if your boyfriend won't leave the house if there is a game playing. If you're feeling neglected, I suggest you sit under the TV. It will feel like all of the men in the joint are staring at you. Can't wait to hang out on the patio next time.

Steak=astounding. I always order the filet. It's shockingly good. Be careful, though, the plates will give you a 2nd degree burn if you aren't careful. I had a scar for months from my run-in with one--apparently I have a pretty high pain threshold. The bread basket? If you aren't stuffed after being in the vicinity of one, I'm disappointed in you. The sides? Don't make me describe the macaroni and cheese, I start drooling uncontrollably and we both know that isn't attractive. The desserts? Three words: warm butter cake. Delish. But, did I mention the steaks? Oh mama....  The bar area is well-stocked with assorted older ladies who are looking for their freshly-pressed Hawaiian shirt wearing meal tickets, complete with a live band that sings "hits" from the 70s. Try to get a seat so you can watch the action on the dance floor from your table (or sit in one of the small tables that face the bar if you can't get enough Elton John or Barry Manilow in your life.) Super-entertaining. You can order the full-menu from the bar, if you decide to camp out there. It's pricey, but in my opinion, a lot better than many steakhouse options out there. Enjoy.

It's weird. I want to love Chez Nous, but I don't yet. You know how it is, it's hard to compare a copy to the original. If you've been to the now defunct location at 7th Avenue & Indian School, it's similar. The bouncers are friendly and just the right amount of chatty, my customized bicycle-riding photographer friends enjoy hanging about there, and the soul music will make you want to get down with your bad self on the dance floor.  The night I went, they didn't accept credit cards so that was a bit off-putting. It's not the end of the world to pay two separate ATM fees: once to get in, and then again to buy round of drinks, but it is annoying. (I've been since and was able to use a credit card at the bar but plan on a $25 minimum, an additional 20% gratuity automatically added.) I've been lucky to be able to grab a table every time I go, with no hovering. Even on a fully packed First Friday. The staff could be a little friendlier. Otherwise, it's ok.  But, all in all, it's just not the first place I want to go on a Friday night, dig?

I'll admit it, I have a strange obsession when it comes to yogurt. This all stems from a time when I was in Paris, went to a HUGE underground grocery store and found some yogurt that was divine. I've never been able to find it since. This might have to do with the fact that I scarfed it down while walking on the street, threw it away, and then realized how good it was--without memorizing the brand name.   Fresh and Easy has a yogurt that is as good as the kind I ate overseas. This shouldn't surprise me, as this is owned by an overseas company (the British conglomerate Tesco owns the chain) and it's a very, very good thing these are opening up in Phoenix. Think Trader Joe's prices, with a bunch of really well designed (packaging-wise) and tasty items, where almost everything is organic.   The meat...I splurged and bought some filet mignon and it was quite possibly some of the best filet I've purchased in Phoenix. Pricey, but good. The spring rolls? The wrapper was fantastic, so light and crispy. The vegetables crunchy and fresh tasting. They have an excellent selection of all of the things I enjoy looking at  and buying. I'm not a "buy rice in a 10lb. bag and soak my own pinto beans" type of girl. Lots of convenience foods, prepared items, great breads, desserts, etc. It's quite compact, like an overseas or urban grocery store. Everything you need (one-stop), just less of it.   I went to one of the few locations that are open at this point, on Baseline and 19th Avenue. Many more are to come.

I made plans for lunch with one of my Republic friends and we decided to give Breadfruit a try. I had read mixed reviews, but figured they had worked all of the kinks out by now. My take? The food was fresh but not savory or super-tasty. I started with the plantain avocado spring roll. The chutney was delicious and saved the dish. Without it? I probably wouldn't have bothered. My entree was the jerk chicken. Overall, there was a good amount of heat with no depth of flavor. My friend ordered the jerk shrimp and wasn't impressed. She even complained that the slaw was under-seasoned and bland. Overall, it's one of those things...I guess it's hard to keep things seasoned and juicy when you have a big lunch rush. Plus, the restaurant was really warm, temperature-wise. It's a small space with the kitchen just off the dining area, so it might have been radiating from there.   There are several vegetarian and vegan options on the menu, which is a plus. I will definitely be back for another try--possibly to try the curried tofu.

BevMo fills me with glee. It's totally where bartenders die and go to heaven. Need some signature Trader Vic's Mai Tai mix swimming with delicious corn syrup and tangy citric acid? You'll find it here. In fact, if I won some kind of sweepstakes where I had 5 minutes to grab as much as I could at a store, I would probably come here. From Jager dispensers to wine, hard to find micro-brews to random imported rums and every mixer you can imagine, if it's on your list, look no further.

Ah, yes, Il Posto. I really want to like you, but it seems like every time I come (either when it was Our Gang or in its current incarnation as Il Posto) I leave a bit disappointed. The last night we came it was on a Wednesday. They attempted to seat us on the patio, but unfortunately someone was smoking cigars out there. So my friends requested we move inside. Now, when something like this happens, more experienced waitstaff normally says the following "Of course. Allow us to seat you inside. One moment." Our waitress instead confusedly looked at us as if she didn't believe us, picked up the menus, then scanned the area to determine who was smoking a cigar, then as we felt the need to apologize, continued to scan the patio to find the perpetrator. I'm assuming if she spied them, she was going to say something or perhaps the delay was to fulfill her own curiosity. However, it might have been a good idea get our party situated before she got down to the bottom of things, Sherlock Holmes-style. The food was mediocre, as always (I ordered the chicken parmesan with its soggy, eggy breading and my friends ordered pasta.) Sigh. Even though it's in my neighborhood, I probably would prefer to drive a bit further and go to a different Italian restaurant in the future.

Yes, add me to the list of fans of this fine establishment. I ordered the carne asada tacos and the jamaica (uh, it was mui authentico served with a punch ladle) and fell in love with the beach bar atmosphere. Definitely recommend.

OTFM is great, I go there several times a month and brave the crowds in the McClendon's Select area of the market to stock up on organic produce. Tip: save your cash, just grab the receipt and use your debit card at the cashier stand. Also, don't miss the other offerings (Sweet Republic ice cream, fantastic BBQ brisket sandwiches, fresh coffee, food trucks, local breads, grass-fed beef and other cuts of meat). You'll also have the opportunity to speak directly to several local chefs and restaurant owners who frequent the market. Catch it before it closes for the Summer!

Pure and simple: Tuck Shop is spot on. This is the neighborhood where my grandmother lived my entire life, so it was a bit of a homecoming. It's somewhat life-affirming to see a restaurant like this do so well in the middle of a residential neighborhood.   To start, there are two parking lots, one main lot next to the restaurant and another overflow lot across the street. We arrived at 7:30 on a Saturday night and had no trouble finding a space next to the restaurant. The restaurant consists of a large oblong space, and there is a small, cozy area called the book room (I think) which is offset from the dining area. You can order drinks from the waitstaff there while you wait for your table. Though there was an estimated hour long wait for our party, we ended up snagging three seats at the bar about 5 minutes after we arrived and decided to eat there instead.   The food was simple and excellent. Roasted garlic in a pool of olive oil with toasted baguette pieces; breaded fontina cheese with sweet (cinnamon pear) and savory (red bell pepper) sauces. For entrees we ordered the citrus brined crispy fried chicken (3 pieces) with vinegary collard greens and two savory white cheddar waffles topped with melted butter; crab cakes (5 or 6) with a cup of corn chowder and a side of prosciutto specked macaroni and cheese. Everything was amazing--the fried chicken, though was probably the best I've ever had. So crispy on the outside, brimming with juiciness and flavor on the inside.  Our bartender/waiter was great and chatted with us periodically throughout the evening, telling us of his bartending days in Brooklyn. One of his regulars was a mafia crime boss and he would always make him a Campari and soda. (He makes a mean Pimms Cup, too. Oh so good.)  Can't wait to see how this restaurant develops.

My friend was visiting from Brooklyn and wanted to take me out for a fancy dinner. A friend had recommended J & G to us, so we called ahead then headed over on a Friday night.   Fastest elevator outside of NYC, seriously. Zipped to the fifth floor in milliseconds. Service=impeccable. Nate was our server and was so friendly. We were helped by several people in the restaurant throughout our dinner, so you get to know most of the staff by the end of the night. (Thanks for delivering the best dessert ever, Khi!)   The environs are modern and beautiful. We were seated in one of the outside tables and asked to move to a table closer to the windows (and the view.) We were there a bit early, so the staff were happy to accommodate us. My friend and I both ordered 8-oz filets, broccoli topped with melted parmesan and asparagus simply dressed with lemon and olive oil. The dessert we shared isn't listed on the menu online, but it involved Kuzu sorbet, spiked with merengues on a base of pure creaminess. Highly recommend it. Kuzu is asian citrus and has a really distinctive and refreshing flavor. Along with the French Malbec we shared, it was lovely dinner and night.

Just like the other location, with these added pluses (and minuses):  + It's biking distance to my house. (+++!) + The skateboard stickers on the cabinet in one of the bathrooms. + $20 Tuesdays (Plank of bruschetta and a bottle of wine=2 dimes.) + Indoor and outdoor bar seating. + A retro arrow sign right above the front door.  - Forced valet parking if I bring my car. I like parking my car. It avoids that "Where are my keys? Where are my keys?!!!!!" panic.  But, let's be honest, everyone knows if you bring me a pub board and a mini-pitcher of Hoegaarden, I'm a happy girl.

Luci's Healthy Marketplace is quite adorable. Bright colors and retro signage showcase their coffee bar, deli and grocery offerings. It's a hip health food store. I grew up eating carob, being dragged to health food stores to buy dried fruit (that my mom would try to convince me was as tasty as candy) and granola bars. So, I'm well acquainted with the crunchy granola lifestyle--but when you think of Luci's, think slick San Francisco style crunchy granola. I dig it. You can find a great selection of Simply Bread (shout out to my old 'hood), purchase your herbal supplements, buy some gluten-free breadstick mix, pick up some environmentally friendly cleanser, order a fresh coffee and pastry (and soon be able to order meals from their deli...) then sit down and relax in their lovely dining area. This is a nice addition to the neighborhood.

Lovely and delightful is this new girl Lola. I'm a total sucker for a good, cinnamon-y mexican style coffee, and Lola has an amazing one (it's called the Matador and comes complete with three shots of espresso and a dollop of homemade flavored whipped cream--$4 for a large.) The actual coffee house space is fantastic, as you would expect from anything Wayne touches. Shiny polished concrete floors, with a mix of modern and retro fixtures throughout. Makes me very happy. Being able to bring an iced coffee over to Haus and Oliver and Annie makes me even happier. Can't wait for Hula's Modern Tiki to open up in this plaza, too.

This is my visual of what a typical OnTrac driver's home looks like: piles and piles of boxes in every room of their home. Every night, they mark all of their scheduled deliveries signed for (by FD) and throw the latest shipments on the pile. On the weekends, they invite their friends over and open each box to see what Amazon has refunded, replaced or reshipped at no cost to them. In fact, I have to assume that Amazon pays them for this service.   I'm sure several of the drivers must have a steady Ebay business (obviously never using OnTrac for their shipper because they want to keep their stars up). On the boxes where someone actually contacted OnTrac and reported their ineptitude/criminal behavior, they proceed to step on the boxed shipments and run them through with metal poles to be delivered in a week or two--maybe three. It depends on how long it takes to find the box in the pile of other undelivered boxes in their living room.  Or...perhaps it's a ploy from Amazon (or other companies) to discourage same/next day shipping. I mean, if same/next-day shipping always takes three weeks of repeated refunds, orders and deliveries--that's gotta keep someone busy, right?

I'll make this quick: LAME.   First day it's in the high 90s and H&M didn't get the memo: no A/C in the store. Add to that one employee was stationed at the main registers. Unfortunately, there was a woman in the front of the line buying her son about 40 items. Clerk was finally offered assistance (15 minutes later, after 8 people lined up, while another clerk came over, picked up the first clerk's walkie-talkie, remarked on the fact that it didn't work and walked away) in the way of third clerk showing up and making an announcement they were dividing the line. The people behind me RAN for the other line. Um...I had been waiting 15 minutes and after the great divide announcement, and was STILL stuck behind the woman with 40 items. Really?! Yes, really.   Checked in on FourSquare, saw a "tip" that the second floor register was faster. Left the line, walked upstairs, saw a note taped to the register "Register closed". Of course. I mean, there are only four people downstairs trying to buy loads of children's clothing plus another 5 people buying adult clothing. Makes sense that you would make the decision to close the register in the children's department upstairs. FANTASTIC.  WHAT IS IT WITH STORES LIKE THIS MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PURCHASE THEIR CLOTHING?! Kills me. Exit left.

Ok, so I show up on a Sunday night (a.k.a. Valentine's Day in most of the Western world) to grab a drink with some friends, walked in the door and was greeted by three small children running for the door. If I were drinking something at the time, would have definitely done a spit take. My thought process: Kids? Bar? Then, why wasn't I allowed to go to a bar as a 6-year old? I felt momentarily robbed.  There was definitely some kind of party going on, lots of balloons everywhere, country/western music blasting from the DJ booth. Lots of locals without a lot of teeth who got down with their bad selves on the dance floor, with a side of some Paco Paco holdovers wearing exotically printed tight dresses standing their ground. Drinks (premium) were $5.50, and were incredibly tiny. We stayed long enough to finish my miniature drink and headed out. Might give it another try when it isn't kid's birthday/Paco Paco Valentine's day/dancing toothless locals/Country/Western night. Maybe.

Sam's Gyros is great. I'm a sucker for good, quick gyros and I dare you to find another place that has a gyros platter that contains more food (two people can share it easily.) Comes with a greek salad, and a huge pile of rice (basmati, I think) alongside the ginormous serving of succulent gyro meat.   Sam and his wife are always in the store, and sometimes their son (I think...) mans the cash registers, too. They're super-sweet. I've also run into doctors and nurses from JCL when they're picking up food before their shifts. So if you need an impromptu medical consult while you wait for your dinner, I'm sure one of them would be happy to oblige. But, seriously, good food, reasonably priced, huge servings...if you're in or near the 'Slope, hit it soon.

Fifth & Wine is a nice wine bar in Old Town. The staff was great, very helpful. In fact, they sat down with us repeatedly throughout our visit to check on us, tell us a little bit about the place and the menu.   The bruschetta is delicious, inventive and reasonably priced. They only have one Sauvignon Blanc, but the one they have is pretty good. Lots of cozy couch seating in addition to the bar and table set-ups. Great happy hour. Check it.

They now carry a perfectly servicable New Zealand sauvignon blanc, added some mood lighting, have an excellent happy hour menu and have expanded their bruchetta offerings (try the hummus...it's outrageous). Happiness.

After enjoying another homemade heirloom Caprese salad using their 18 year old traditional balsamic vinegar, I had to post a review.   Being a Phoenix native, at first I was skeptical about a shop located in a touristy area of Old Town Scottsdale. But, being that it's a block or so away from OTFM, my friends talked me into walking over. The store is located in a newly remodeled row called the Frontier Shops. Ah, Old Town Scottsdale, you never disappoint.   Their olive oils and vinegars are imported. As mentioned at the outset, my favorite is the aged Modena Balsalmic ($18 for 375ml). I also ended up going with a Spanish Picual Extra Virgin Olive Oil that has a wonderful fresh, grassy flavor and is wonderful for topping salads and homemade vanilla bean ice cream.  If you want to skip the Spaghetti Western back-drop, head over to their Paradise Valley Mall location, next to Macy's or visit them online at  oliveoilarizona.com.

I had heard good things about The Lounge. Every age group should be able to find a nook they like (barflies: bar stools; mods: white leather chairs--that's where I sat; my parents: the burgundy tinted Victorian chairs in the entry way; overflow: tall tables on the edge of the room; families: the mushroom-like stools near the windows). I enjoyed the music, it was just the right amount of lounge-y.  There's a happy hour until 6:30 during the week; which includes three discounts on the food and some on well drinks and beers. Il Posto appears to supply the food and if you've read my previous reviews, I'm not a huge fan. But, I'll admit, the appetizers were serviceable (we ordered crispy bruschetta bites, cheese pizza and fried zucchini). However, food isn't the reason why you'll find me in a bar.   I started off with an Old Fashion ($8) their version of an Old Fashioned, which featured Four Roses Bourbon as the main ingredient. I was hoping for more of a 'Bourb (a la The Parlor) experience, but turns out this tasted a lot like cinnamon schnapps. Not my style. After that, I went straight for the Makers on the rocks ($7), as they didn't have Jamesons. I tried my friend's sangria ($8) and it was mighty tasty. The waitstaff and bartender were incredibly attentive and helpful.   Overall, I walked away thinking it's a very nice addition to the 'Slope. Looking forward to biking over in nice weather.

My friend Eve told me about Salon Embellish about a year ago right after it opened. Because I am such an Aveda freak, I had a free gift certificate through their awards program and Salon Embellish was one of the salons on the list. So, I made an appointment for both a massage and a facial. As you walk in, you're greeted by a minimalist modern decor and Aveda products lined up on shelves. I love Aveda products, as anyone within breathing distance of me knows already. (I've had friends tell me that I smell like an Aveda factory.)   Dionna, the owner, is amazing and very sweet. You will probably end up speaking to her at least once during your visit and she's delightful. It's a very family-oriented atmosphere, very welcoming. My massage went well, though the music (lots of chanting monks) had to be fairly loud to drown out the energy of the salon. Next was my facial...which was my favorite part. Syreeta was great and answered all of my questions throughout the process, and gave me lots of helpful tips. It was so relaxing and my skin looked so healthy and glowing after. She does a great job and their prices are quite reasonable.   Highly recommend. I've gone back for several facials since my first visit. (In fact, I recommended it to a friend of mine from work and he now goes there regularly, even though he has gift certificates for resorts and spas in the Valley he has yet to use.)

These aren't just hot dogs. They are snappy Schreiner's sausages loaded with most anything you can imagine--and perhaps some things you wouldn't. I tried the 'Lady', which is topped with a spicy chipotle cream cheese sauce, grilled onions and fried pickle pieces, all snugly wrapped in warm middle eastern flat bread. Each box of hot dog happiness comes complete with a Dum Dum lollipop, which you can tuck into your updo to enjoy later.   I found them in my 'hood while waiting in line to pick up my tickets for the Sunnyslope Modern Home Tour. But, I've heard you can find them in the parking lot at Phoenix Public Market or you may want to follow them on Twitter (@shortleashdogs) to find out where they are setting up shop next.

Anytime I say the code word "BBQ", my parents are in. So, I called my parents to meet me for dinner on a Tuesday night. My take? Not awesome. This surprised me for a couple reasons: 1) the lot is always packed when I drive by and 2) when I mentioned where I was going, one of my co-workers who had been to another location said we were in for a treat. But, I should have known not to trust a barbecue place that doesn't smell like barbecue when you walk in.   It took a while for someone to greet us when we walked in the door. I was there, as I mentioned, with my parents. On a weeknight. I expected they would give us a choice of either dining room or the bar. Instead, we got a head nod while walking briskly by and a "find yourself a spot in the bar" dismissal. We picked a booth near the door. There are 13 flat screen TVs on the walls of the bar. I know this because the the service was so slow, it gave me ample time to count them. Repeatedly. When the food arrived, it was mediocre. The ribs? Not terrible. Cole slaw? Don't waste your time. I sampled my dad's and couldn't believe they served it without tasting in the kitchen first. Bland starts to describe it. He exchanged it for another side, with similar lackluster results. Our server was negligent, busy and disinterested. She asked me if she had brought me the wine I ordered right before she dropped off the bill. When the bill came, my dad (for the first time in the history of me dining with him) said "don't worry about leaving a good tip, I guarantee you won't be back".   Note: I did leave a good tip, but he was right. Unless they make a lot changes quickly, I definitely won't be back.

If you're looking for a man, this should be your next destination. Men love this place. (A coworker of mine met her fiance eating lunch here and now lives in Tampa, so if you're in the market for a burrito and a cross-country move, you might want to give it a try.)  My favorite? I love the spicy Barbacoa soft tacos (3 per order), in which they use shredded beef braised for hours and saturated with tastiness. Their meat is all naturally raised, if that's important to you. C'mon, not a fan of injected hormones in your meat? Pfffff. But, in all seriousness: the toppings are fresh, crunchy and delicious. Go fajita style, if you're so inclined, the carmelized onions and sauteed peppers are tasty. Tip: If you're a burrito type of guy (or, less likely statistically, girl), they come standard with rice. If you're not a fan of starch, ask them to skip it.

The Cresent Ballroom makes me happy.   We've seen We Were Promised Jetpacks (the sound was turned up so high, it pulverized my eardrums...and I like my eardrums nice and pulverized); Sergio Mendoza Y La Orkesta; Miniature Tigers and several other bands. Great small- to medium-sized venue, good sound, excellent A/C (!!!) and bleachers parallel to the stage should you decide sitting is more your style. Parking can be sketchy, only because there's a pay lot next door and there always seems to be someone sleeping on the ground in the back side of the lot.   So, I recommend you get there early, park on the street and spend some time in their outstanding lounge before the show. Or you could just hit the lounge like we did last weekend.   Go.

Here's the thing--I like salty food. But, this feels like being served in a third world country. Long winding lines for food--check. Food splashed all over the serving dishes and surrounding areas--check. If you go later in the day, items are not refreshed and it looks like a condiment junk yard, anything left is scraped from almost empty containers. Food flopped on trays--check. Mayhem in food prep area (people crossing others paths, reaching over others, melting cheese in tortillas on foil trays)--check. Parking is a nightmare. Basically, the polar opposite of a positive and appetizing experience. I have to assume the owners are currently raking in money until they shut this place down (or city inspectors do it for them).

Rarely do you go to a resale shop with a list and find what you need in one visit. My dishwasher silverware holder had developed several holes, so I snapped a picture of the set-up and headed to Stardust. Within 10 minutes, I had found the exact dishwasher rack and silverware holder I needed for $5. (I won't tell you how much the Maytag supply store wanted for the same rack!) Their credit card machines were down that day, but had some cash so was in/out within 15 minutes.

The good?  Clean, well-stocked store.  Freshly smoked whole chicken and pork loin. Excellent selection of some hard-to-find items, particularly ethnic items. Three to four different kinds of chipotle peppers? Yep. Plantains? Sure thing.  An option if you need cough medicine in the middle of the night. Not cheap (Fry's is typically less expensive) but fairly reasonable prices.   The ugly?  Don't risk self-checkout, 100% go through a regular lane. You are literally on your own if they forget to add a special seasonal item to their system or if you purchase an item requiring identification. As with all Walmart and Sam's Club stores, they will NEVER be staffed to cover the registers, the money order desk (hey, it's the 'Slope, so there is always a line) AND the self-checkout kiosks. The bag holders in the check-out lanes are not set up to accomodate any reusable bags, so the employees usually ignore them.   Very little in the way of organic, dairy alternatives or grass fed anything. Again, since it's the 'Slope, they have locked down anything in the liquor section that is over $15 or popular with shoplifters. There is a bell to ring the single employee who covers this area, the self-checkout lanes and the money order desk. In my experience (yes, I rang it several times) that means you will NOT be purchasing that Maker's Mark you see through the glass.   Let's just say it's definitely worth the drive to go somewhere else unless it's a really small, uncomplicated, non-alcoholic order on a day when there aren't a lot of other customers.

Ah...'Slope Walmart. Decided to give them another chance, since they are my neighborhood market (both literally and figuratively). Waited behind a woman at the register. After her order was complete, started putting one of my 10 items down on the conveyer belt. The employee informed me her register was closed, so I picked up my items and moved to an adjacent register. That same employee then served two customers after me. While I was standing right in front of her. Seriously. Who does that?  After 15 more minutes of waiting, I abandoned my cart, never to return again.

Sadly, this location is having a hard time getting on its feet. Today during the lunch rush, they scheduled a sign installation, requiring two gigantic trucks to take up the entire East side of the parking lot. This required workers to drill a plate blocking the drive-thru lane. To make matters worse, the kitchen couldn't keep up with the orders that were able to come in, few as they were. They sent two cars to wait for their orders, making them drive around the men with drills and after another 10 minute wait, at least one of those orders were wrong. On every visit, the drive-thru speaker isn't operating correctly (it's amusing what they hear when placing any order) and parts of the stand block the menu. You will never get the sauce you request, so don't bother asking. Another bonus? The employees are impatient--yeah, I would answer your question if I could see the part of the menu you're asking me to make a decision on. But, thank you for asking me the same question again, this time slowly and loudly.   It's a hot mess.
