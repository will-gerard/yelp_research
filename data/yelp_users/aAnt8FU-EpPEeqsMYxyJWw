The interior and atmosphere of the Mighty Cup is super cute and cozy, set in this little old house with an adorable "COFFEE" sign outside of it. There were board games available and the couch along the wall reminded me of one my grandma's.  I came in here twice in one night - the first was for quite possibly the best raspberry vanilla Italian cream soda I'd ever had, and the second time was for a dirty chai and a slice of lemon cake. I finished the cake before I got back to my friend's work (after the fact, blindly crossing the street while stuffing my face with that delicious baked good might not have been the best idea). The dirty chai was heavy with espresso which pleased me greatly, and it gave me just the pick me up I needed.   If I'm in the area again, I'll be sure to make a point to go back and I recommend the cakes as much as the coffee!

I came here for the first time to watch one of the England games during the World Cup. The atmosphere was great - they had a whole tent and festive banners set up outside paired with misters to help combat the heat. I, however, made a poor choice as far as food goes. The grilled cheese was very "meh" and I should have gone with the good ol' fish and chips like my friend (I tried a bite -- they were fantastic).   One of my favorite parts of this little spot is the artwork on the walls. From James Bond to The Clash to A Clockwork Orange, I have to say it all adds to the experience. I'd definitely give it another shot because we spent hours in there and had plenty to keep us occupied, plus the staff was very nice and laid back so when we broke out the Jenga and Connect Four sets, they didn't try and rush us out of there.

This little coffee shop has been a favorite of mine for a while, but that being said, I don't spent nearly enough time in here. Today I hung out in a comfy corner all day, going from the refreshing Peach Breeze (peach black tea plus lemon, sparkling Perrier and some other sort of deliciousness) to the turkey panini which wasn't exactly what I was originally wanting to get, but boy was it tasty. That bread was flawless, crusty, and it really made the sandwich exceptional.  They always seem to be playing good music in here which always makes any dining or coffee experience better. The staff here is super friendly and helpful and are quite patient with my indecisiveness. I love this place, really. Good coffee, fair prices, and tasty snacks and sandwiches. Plus, it's at a great location - right across from the light rail!

Good food? Check. Comfortable atmosphere? Check. Good music? Triple check. Crescent is where you have to go if you're downtown and looking for a place to relax a little. The prices are all reasonable, and they have a happy hour and daily specials as well if you're looking for extra savings.  I have yet to see a show here, but I've only heard good things about it from multiple people so I am very much looking forward to my first time. From what I've seen on their calendar, they offer a variety of high-quality free shows as well as cheap and moderately priced gigs. Trivia night 6-8 pm on Sundays is becoming a favorite tradition of mine. Just make sure you get there early enough if you want to sit inside (I'd say get there around 5 if you have more than three people).

My first trip in here was for Easter brunch courtesy of my grandmother. This time there was a little issue with getting the attention of a staffer to be seated, but the food did not disappoint. Challah has to be one of my favorite breads, so seeing that their french toast was made with it just about had me dancing in my seat. I ordered two slices because I assumed they were going to be along the same lines as the huge, thick, and fluffy chocolate chip pancakes I had during Easter - I was right.  The slices were the size of my face so they more than filled my hungry stomach and the side of pork sausage and bacon was the cherry on top. I would definitely recommend Breakfast Club Cityscape to anyone who's looking for a good breakfast place downtown. They're open on the weekends, too! Next time I look forward to trying some of their lunch options - I think the grilled cheese is calling my name.

I came here as a part of a friend's birthday barhop last night and I have to say it met my low expectations.   The music was all the same (unce unce unce), the wait staff was dismissive, and the cocktails were terrible. All of our drinks were way too sweet - no mint leaves could be seen in my passion mojito... was it really even a mojito then? I didn't have any food, but my friends who did seemed satisfied with it despite it taking a while to come out. The lighting was virtually nonexistent, not even in the "setting the mood" good kind of way - we all had to break out our phone flashlights so we could be able to read the menus.  I would've given it only one star, but I decided it earned two because of the nice $5 arcade card check-in deal. Plus, we did get a nice view of post-baseball game fireworks show. Overall, though, I can't say I'll be very eager to return for anything except for the arcade games. It's just not my kind of place.

Fantastic food and wonderful drinks, B&T is a breath of fresh air to the downtown Phoenix night scene. So much down here has limited night/weekend hours, I was rather excited to hear about this place.   The first time I visited was about a week after they opened. I had a drink (classic caipirinha) and a bite to eat (the baked hangover - a delicious bowl of bready, saucy goodness topped with an egg that I was very sad to see had been taken off the menu when I returned). The music was a bit loud on my second trip in, but then again it was a Friday night so it maybe should have been expected.   It has a cool industrial feel that you can't really find anywhere else in the area. Overall, B&T is a great place to come for drinks and, if you're willing to splurge a little, some food too.

Oh Royal... I love this place. This location is perfect - right off the light rail and on the way to campus. It's very accessible and the outdoor patio is going to be great for these cooler fall days. The coffee is premium and the baristas are always friendly. The general feel of the place is right up my alley. All of the wood and metal gives it both an urban and rustic feel.  It's a wonderful coffee shop, a great place to come with a book and read, or bring your computer and get some work done. Whatever you're looking for in a coffee shop, Royal is pretty much guaranteed to have it.
