Great place to get a good hand car wash.  Much better than a machine and worth every penny.

Best donuts anywhere. Krispy Kreme has nothing on this place.

This is my first time flying with US Airways and the only friendly people were the ticket agents.  The plane heading to and from San Jose, CA was dirty.  There was food trash on the floor in 3 different rows and trash in the magazine pouches.  Doesn't anyone do a quick check when they turn a plane over.  Maybe the flight attendants should do a quick check.  US Airways should take a little pride in themselves.  Southwest Airlines is still my #1 carrier.  Everyone is nice and planes have always been clean.  Maybe my $25 baggage fee should go into some customer service training for your flight attendants and cleaning your planes.

This is a good place if you need a quick bite downtown.  Fast service as well.  I recommend the Traffic Jam or Italian sandwiches.

This is a very cool place and great coffee and pastries. The bad part is the music is way too loud that its sorta irritating.

Apple could learn a thing or two from this place. They have great customer service and not that pretentious feeling I normally get in an Apple store. They listen as I explained my issue and were able to fix it right there in the shop while I waited. If I ever need an Apple product fixed again or need to buy any Apple peripherals this is the place I will be going.

I have taken my straight razor in here a few times and the Phoenix Knife House brings is back to brand new every time. The customer service here is outstanding, staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Plus the service is pretty quick.  This is the only place I will go to get anything sharpened. Next up are the kitchen knives.

This is a great place. Love the atmosphere, staff is very cool, food is good. Love the music but a little loud. The only minus is I'm in an English Pub, where is my soccer, Rugby, or Aussie Rules Football?  Definitely will be back.

Good food and inexpensive.  The market is worth walking through while you wait.

This is a great place for lunch or you just need to get out have a coffee, quick nosh, and relax. Located in an old house with a lot of local artwork on the walls. It gives the place good character and laid back vibe. This place has something for everyone, food, coffee, pastries, beer, and even cocktails. I would have no problem coming here for a beer and relaxing on their patio while I read a book or play Clash of Clans.  I ordered the Plantation Chicken wrap. It was very good. Chicken, oranges, nuts mix together in a spinach wrap. Defiantly would order it again.  The only warning.. "Welcome to Central Phoenix where there is minimal parking". Don't even attempt to park in their lot as there are only a handful of spaces. Save yourself the hassle and just park on 3rd Ave and walk over.

Was in the mood from some pizza and decided to try Hob Knobs. Ordered their Roman Red Pepper pizza with chicken and it was awesome.  Fresh and great flavors. The roasted chicken is worth the extra cost. The artichokes added that extra which knocked the pizza or of the park. Definitely worth getting again.  Hats off to the cook and the friendly staff that work here.

This is a great place to have a cold brew or a nice drink. It has a good atmosphere and the staff at the bar are great. They are friendly, fun, and knowledgeable. The best part is the music, great selection. If your looking for a good selection of whiskey this is the place.  Plus where can you go where the bartender can tie his own bowtie. As the Doctor says... "Bowties are cool!"

This place has some good sushi. Happen to see it driving back from the casino. I wish it was located in Phoenix.

The food was very good.  I would definitely order the Tavern Burger again but... the service sucked!  This is why I only gave it 2 stars.  There were 3 of us and when we have to wait 5 minutes for drinks thats a little long in my book.  Everything was slow from the drinks, food, and even check getting to us.    I may give this place a second chance just to see if it was an off day.

I really liked this place. Good atmosphere and music. Wish the wifi worked. A little pricey for the coffee but it was definitely worth it. The scone.. All I have to say is Starbucks doesn't even compare.

There are a lot mediocre coffee places in Phoenix but this isn't one of them. I had the most amazing Cappuccino here. The best I have found so far. It was very smooth, I swear they added an angel tear to top it off. I also tried this raspberry square pastry the was oh so good. Not overly sweet but just sweet enough and the crust had the great buttery taste.  This is definitely a place to go back try and try their other drinks and eats.

The best restaurant in Sky Harbor Airport.  Finally something that HMS Host hasn't destroyed.  The sausage & caramelized onion pizza is the best.  Staff is great and very friendly.

Went in for some breakfast.  I ordered their Pain Purdu which was amazing.  The carmel whiskey sauce was good and not overly sweet.  The staff was very friendly and the place has a great look.  Nice to have a good breakfast place close to home.  Definitly want to try something else off their menu.

Giving this Starbucks 4 stars because of the customer service of the morning staff only. Been to this location at other times of the day and nothing compared to the morning staff. They are very friendly and do their best to great everyone with a smile. They actually take into account people are flying. I do agree with other reviews of the pastries. They suck and they are never that fresh but they also aren't the same pastries you find in the stand-alone Starbucks.

This is a great place in Downtown Phoenix. Went in for lunch and ordered their Pot Pie. It was by far one of the best I have ever eaten. Good flavor and just spicy enough.  Great atmosphere and the staff are very friendly and attentive. Nice outside patio area as well.  This is a great place to ride your bike to if you live in the Central Phoenix area.  Plenty of bike rack space in front.

They have some amazing pastries here. Right now they have the most amazing strawberry pop tart. It is definitely worth getting. It's not overly sweet which was the best part. Hats off to the chef!

Purchased food using a Group On. First was impressed with the staff. They provided great and fast service for the amount of food we purchased. Picked up food for 18 people. The food was excellent and great tasting. We covered the majority of meats they had to offer. The BBQ wasn't overly smokey which tends to happen at many places. Definitely will come back here for BBQ. Great place if you are getting good for a large group.

This is by far one of the best place in Phoenix to get a great burrito. The place is an old house with a small dining area inside for those warm Phoenix days but has seating outside for those perfect nights. When it's comes to their burritos they are amazing. I've tried them all and I have to recommend the pork in been chile. It's one of my favorites. I haven't tried their breakfast yet but it's next up. Service is quick and they have great customer service.
