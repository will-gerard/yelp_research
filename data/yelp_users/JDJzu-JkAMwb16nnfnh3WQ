Ordered the calzone lunch special. Wow! It was big! It even came with a soda with free refills.  Crispy crust and just the right amount of cheeses and sauce. Yum! Definitely a good deal.

I've always had a good experience at this Red Robin. I usually go with friends or a date and get fries when we place our drink order. The food is always hot and correctly prepared. The tables can be a little dirty and the service a bit slower than I'd like but overall it's a great place to get a veggie mushroom swiss burger.

Awesome Thai food!  Lunch time is worst time to go. Try to be there between 11a and 11:30a or after 1p. The wait staff are pretty busy but the food is worth the wait.  The restaurant is tidy and clean. There was no food observed on the floor. It tends to get loud when there's more than 15 people eating. The acoustics weren't meant for a sit down restaurant as you will notice with their drive-thru.  Pricing is very reasonable for lunch. The portions are very big. Tofu was easily substituted for the chicken on the Pakh Thai.  Lunch for two of us with a soda came to around $15. Remember to ask for extra napkins should you order your plate Hot or above.

I started going here since the place opened a few years ago. There was no other Chinese place in Surprise (that I knew of) at the time. Oil is definitely a main ingredient in their dishes. The beef dish I had once was pretty bad and never ordered it again but always loved the orange chicken with lo mein noodles. Lunch specials are pricey. Now that I'm a vegetarian, I have better options so I've never went back. The owner is friendly but always on the phone taking orders. They don't take American Express.

The vegetarian options are pretty good, especially if you like tofu. The restaurant was out of napkins the last time I was there and the staff was friendly. I would recommend the take-out option versus dining in though.

For being a Japanese-style "grill", Yogis is pretty good. There are several 'bowls' available including a Chicken Katsu and many beef flavored inspirations. Yogis rice bowls are offered in brown or white rice. You can add a popular spicy sauce that really adds a kick. Definitely a good eat for lunch.  The employees are very friendly and Michelle loves to smile. Yogis can customize orders to make them vegetarian or add a different sauce or ingredient. There is a pump for teriyaki sauce for those of you that like extra.  Yogis sits near a competing restaurant but they always seem busy during lunch. There is limited outside seating but plenty of seating inside. The tables and dispensers for food and condiments are kept neat and clean.
