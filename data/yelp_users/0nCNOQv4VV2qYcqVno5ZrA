I've been here a couple times now for lunch, and seriously, this is some of the BEST mexican cuisine in The Valley. The experience alone of going here is worth the visit. The price of a meal; super inexpensive. The deliciousness of that meal: out of this world!   The pastries are the next big thing that I look forward too when coming here. It's by far the biggest bakery I've seen with the largest, freshest variety of pastries.   The produce, though I've never bought any myself (others with me have), is very well priced and VERY delicious. My only advice when coming here; know a little Spanish, it helps (I'm still learning). But don't worry, the staff is super friendly and fun (and patient). :)

Finally! An amazing place to get fantastic BBQ sandwiches in Phoenix! I went here for the first time a few weeks back (totally blanked out on the Yelp reviewing).  Some co-workers suggested we go there, saying it was one of the best places in The Valley for pork BBQ. They were right!  It's a tiny restaurant, and chances are you've driven by it a couple times but just have never noticed it. It's nothing fancy inside, just great service, great food and happy customers. I had one of the massive pork BBQ sandwiches on the menu and had flashbacks of the days when I lived in the Carolinas. MmmMmm deee-licious!  I could go on all day writing about how good Honey Bear's is, but I'll just let you go try it for yourself. Go on! Go!

Pei Wei has always been a HUGE favorite of mine. I've been to a couple locations in The Valley, but this one I've been going too more than others. I've always ordered online and picked up the food after about 15-20 minutes, and every time it's always there waiting for me!   Wait time? Hardly! If you do wait, it's a total of maybe 2 minutes? By then you're just walking back from getting your soda from their new touch-screen soda machine. Yeah...it's touch screen. There's so many flavors of drinks in this thing! My favorite is to mix Orange Coca-Cola and Vanilla Coca-Cola. Mmmm, goes great with the Orange Peel Signature dish!   Aside from the epic soda machine and tiny (if any) wait time, the staff is super friendly, even during its busiest times. And trust me, this place can get packed during the lunch hour.   PARKING TIP: If you're looking for a parking spot during the lunch hour it's nearly impossible. However, if you park on the north end of the Walgreen's next door (under the trees), there's almost always a spot. If that's full, then the spots at the front of Walgreen's on the east side are always opened. All you have to do is walk around the corner and BAM! You're at Pei Wei.

Athens Gyros & Pasta is my favorite place to get gyros in The Valley. I discovered this place after some friends found it one random day. It was fieldtrip time for us as we piled into the car and walked in, curious if this tiny, hole-in-the-wall restaurant was going to deliver good food. Just like most small restaurants; the food was out of this world! I've been several, SEVERAL times, and even though I no longer live in that neighborhood, I still re-route on the way back from work every so often to stop by and grab the chicken gyro combo.   The chicken gyro is my all-time favorite! They pile it high with meat and add just the right amount of sauce EVERY time. The fries that come with it are also dee-lish, not comparable to McDonalds or Del Taco Fries...they're more like those amazing county fair fries.   The ladies that work there are always so sweet, every single time (and I've been dining PLENTY of times at this place).  If you're in the area, skip the Denny's or Burger King in the parking lot, and stop by Athens to try a gyro, you won't be disappointed.  (On a side note, the "atmosphere" of this place may not be up to par with the big restaurants or East Valley dining, but I'm someone who goes for food and service, the look of the restaurant is last on my list.)

I went here for the first time today during the lunch hour, and holy moly was it good! A friend recommended it, so we all went (as a rather large group) to try it out.   It's not a very fancy place, but boy does it deliver some great food! And the price is unbeatable; just about everything is under $10. I had "Pepe's Sample Platter" for ~$8 so I could try a little bit of everything. Others got burros, enchiladas and I think someone even got a tamale. Not one of us was disappointed.   The service is also extremely fast and very friendly. If you're looking for a place to grab a quick bite to eat south of Old Town, skip the fast food burgers and stop by El Molino.

Bob (the owner) is an awesome guy who is one of the few mechanics that actually works with you in explaining (and even showing) what's wrong with your car. Which is perfect! Because you KNOW what exactly is and NEEDS to be worked on. Bob's honesty and amazing knowledge of all sorts of makes and models is phenomenal. I have a Honda now, but before that, I used to take my Dodge Intrepid to him. Don't let the "Asian Auto" name fool you, Bob can problem solve any type of make and model of car.  When I had my Dodge, I had an oil leak in it, and the dealer wanted to replace a ton of unnecessary parts. The dealer was telling me it would cost $2,500 to fix the problem. When I took it to Bob, he showed me what they were talking about (I had then realized the dealer was trying to rip me off), and that the there was only ONE thing that needed to be fixed for the leak to stop. So, Bob took care of the REAL problem with my Dodge, and I saved over $2,000 dollars. The car worked GREAT and the oil leak never existed again!  I've been taking my cars to him for over two years, and was referred by a friend who's been taking her cars to him for nearly a decade. I would highly recommend Asian Auto to anyone who is looking for a truly honest mechanic that also has reasonable pricing.  You're awesome Bob! I'll be bringing my cars to you for years to come! :)

First time here was also the last time. I came here for lunch to meet up with my Aunts on a Monday afternoon. The place was pretty packed, but they seemed to be staffed pretty well, however...you wouldn't know that with the service we received.  12:00 (noon) - I walked in and found where my Aunts were sitting. Sat down, was greeted by the waitress immediately and ordered my drink.  12:15 - ordered my $8 mini burger plate with fries.  12:30 - tables around us finished eating and new customers sat down, then ordered.  12:45 - new customers received their food...we were still waiting for ours...   1:00pm - after several apologies from the waitress, and several trips she took to the kitchen to find out where the hell our food was, we ended up deciding to take the meal to go.  1:15pm - we finally got our meal, to go. Thankfully the waitress said the bill was on them, and apologized for the unusual wait.   The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars, and not 1, is because the bill was taken care of and we didn't have to pay for an hour long wait with no food. Also, I was tweeting about the service, and the @chilis twitter account wanted details, and tried to help during the last 10-15 minutes there. Oh, the food was decent. It's what you would expect from any other Chili's.

My favorite place for amazing Mexican food!  I came here with a bunch of friends for the first time a while back. Never would I have expected such amazing food from this hidden treasure.  The restaurant: First of all, you wait outside in this crazy-awesome decorated patio, where the bar is opened to you and friends to have drinks while your table is being prepared. It gets pretty busy (and I can see why) so you can expect to enjoy the unique patio for a while. Which, is perfect when you're with a bunch of friends!  The bar: we had one drink: the HUGE pitcher of margaritas. It's about $25 and you get and entire pitcher of margaritas. They are probably some of the best ones I've had here in Phoenix.  The food: is truly amazing. I had the enchilada with a fried egg on top. The size was more than enough and everything about it was perfect!  The service: I really couldn't tell you how quick the service was. I was having such a great time with friends (and the margaritas) that time wasn't even on my mind.   For a great time, awesome food and great margaritas, come here! :)

This is my favorite place to eat (so far) at Kierland. I honestly didn't know Tommy Bahama even had a restaurant, but hey! It's pretty delicious food!   The last two times I've been here I had the Habana Cabana Pork Sandwich (my all time favorite) and the Old San Juan Shrimp and Scallops (in this amazing curry sauce). The price is, quite high. However, you can't beat the beautiful patio seating, friendly service, great drinks and delicious food!

I experienced Famous Daves BBQ late one after work. A co-worker and I stopped by during the last half hour and he promised the food was amazing: he wasn't kinding!  We had a sampler with BBQ sandwiches, but before we got our food the waitress gave a little tutorial on all their famous sauces in a cool little presentation (that we got to taste of course). My favorite sauce: rich and sassy! The best part about Famous Daves is that you can buy the sauces to take home. And, be sure to check out your WalMart because they might even have the famous sauce for sale. :)   All around Famous Daves is great! And its a national chain, so you can find them all over the country.

A few of us from work went here for lunch one day. What a treat! Cornish Pasty is a small little place, but the food is just the opposite. Each of our dishes was more than we could eat in one sitting. I had the Cajun Chicken Pasty and it was perfect! Not too spicy, full of bacon and the side of chipotle was amazing! Totally worth more than the $8 for size and deliciousness!  The staff was super friendly and once we sat down, they were right there to take our order. The wait time was pretty short. However, we got there at around 11:30am, and by noon there were no more seats available. Obviously the rest of Tempe knows just how great this place is. So if you want a seat, be sure to get there early or be prepared to wait. If you do wait though, it's totally worth it.

My favorite place for wine!  I come here a lot, but mostly for the wine. The store is cozy, and the staff is super helpful. Their wine guy here can tell you just about anything about every kind of wine. And, if you're a World Market Explorer member, you can get some sweet discounts too!  Another favorite about this place, is the unique treats they have. From chocolates to jam, the food is great!   Overall, the staff, selection and wine make this one of my favorite stores in Happy Valley!

To be quite honest, I've never heard of this place until I wandered by it one lazy Saturday. A friend and I went in expecting to see "ribs" as the primary dish to get. Man, were we wrong! They have amazing pork BBQ sandwiches. Not the BEST, but pretty close (the top 3 in my book of Phoenix BBQ).  The size of the sandwich is definitely filling. My favorite part is when the sandwich has the coleslaw inside it. I saw that they can also cater events, which is totally awesome! I would love to have the next work event catered by Shane's. It looks like they give you tons of BBQ pork to make sandwiches.

I've been to Steves a couple times for a late afternoon meal and drinks. It's a nice short walk from the lightrail towards the Hyatt. Every time has been a pretty good experience. The food is good, and the prices aren't that bad.  The thing I want to point out is the drinks; they're fantastic! I'm the guy who doesn't care much for beer and goes for the mixed drinks (go ahead, laugh). Steves has some of the biggest margaritas I've seen. The price isn't too bad and when waiting for your food, it's nice to have that giant drink and enjoy downtown Phoenix with some friends.  The outdoor seating is nice and sheltered by the buildings, so the sun doesn't cook you while your food is being cooked inside. Honestly, I've never sat inside, I love the outdoor seating so much! Bring on the 110 degree heat!

Sushi Brokers is by far, my favorite sushi place in The Valley. I've been to quite a few different sushi restaurants, but Sushi Brokers has never disappointed. The location is great for those who live in the North Valley.   The selection of sushi is fantastic, and the best ones are the Chimichanga Roll & the Sanchez Roll. They even beat the Las Vegas roll (although that one is amazing too). The price is a little high, but it's a nice place, with a unique blend of sushi & sports bar vibes. Compared to Ra, the food is probably a tad bit better at Sushi Brokers, but only because of the unique southwest influenced rolls. So in the end, it's worth $14 for a rather large Chimi roll (we had 10 large pieces one time, instead of the usual 5 at Ra).   My only debbie-downer about this place is the size. It's super tiny, and even though we have been seated right away every time, I'm waiting for the day that we have to go somewhere to kill some time while a seat opens up.

It seriously doesn't get much better than this when it comes to Mexican cuisine in North-Central Phoenix.   After hearing about this place on Man Vs. Food (as I'm sure many others did), a bunch of us were inspired to try the Torta Del Rey during lunch one day. This thing is monstrous! The size is incredible, and the taste is out of this world! I ate half of it and had to take the rest with me to eat later in the day.   Other than the epic Torta Del Rey, this little restaurant is just one of those great hole-in-wall places that has the best food in the area. If you're in SunnySlope for the artwalk, stop by this place before-hand and see how far you can get into the King of the Tortas!

Bomberos is a unique place, that has always been a joy to go too. I've lost count of how many times I've been there, but here's some of the best highlights:  The wine - my favorite selection of South American wines is here. I'm not a huge wine connoisseur, but I know a good glass (or 5) when I have one.   The food - The panini's are to die for. I really have no complaints when it comes to the food.  The location - the huge back patio is perfect any time of the year, even summertime with its abundant shade.   The service - the staff is great, and it's a very laid-back atmosphere. So don't go if you in a rush. Enjoy the place, the wine, the food and the people.   My favorite time to go is always during the Sunnyslope Artwalks. It's a perfect start to the evening then take two steps outside into dozens of artists booths, music and happy people.

I'm surprised this place go such bad reviews. I had a great experience here, but I was also visiting during a weekday. On a Thursday afternoon, this place is pretty much all yours. We sat outside by the huge WestGate fountains, which is always entertaining to watch on a sunny afternoon.  The staff was friendly, the restaurant was pretty awesome (of course) and the food was great! I had the Cuban Sandwich and it was probably one of the best ones I've had. Though it is a little pricey, the portions are huge! So expect to get filled up.

My first time at PF Changs was at this location. This was also my last time at a PF Changs. It's not because they had terrible service, or bad food; it was because they just...didn't have anything special.   I'm a die hard Pei Wei fan, and quite honestly, I feel as though PF Changs is just  an overpriced, watered-down version of Pei Wei. I felt like the portions were small and the flavor just wasn't there. I would much rather get an Orange Peel Signature Dish to-go at Pei Wei and enjoy an afternoon lunch in the park.

I've been to this theater more times than I can remember. It's an extremely nice theater that typically isn't too crowded, even on opening nights.   The staff is friendly (I've never seen a sad, angry or rude employee). The student prices, which are offered at all Harkins Theaters (I think) you can't beat: $7 with a student ID.   The only reason why I'm not giving them 5 stars is because they have, on multiple occasions, have given me the wrong ticket. I ask for the 8pm, and I get the 7pm. So they make me go back to the counter and get a new ticket while everyone waits for me. They're quick to get me the new ticket, but after a few times, it kind of gets annoying.  Other than that, this is by far my favorite theater in The Valley.

Every time going to this Best Buy I've had a good experience. The staff is extremely helpful, but not overbearing (constantly asking and asking to help like other Best Buys). They ask once, then give you your space. When you have a question, they're always nice and prompt to answer. Perfect customer service.  It gets better though. The most recent visit to this location I had bought a camera, and even with good reviews online, and the help of the BestBuy staff, I found out the audio on the camera was terrible. Just a problem with that model camera. We didn't know.  The next day I returned the camera with its plan, and had the easiest transition with customer service too get a different camera. Within 10 minutes I was in and out with a new and better camera, and didn't spend an extra dime. It was perfect, and the new camera is great!   Just one of the many great experiences at this Best Buy. I would give this 5 stars, but the store itself is super tiny, so selection can be limited (the only drawback).

I have to unfortunately drop by review from 5 stars to 2 stars, and for one reason: the girl at the cash register. There's really no nice way to put it: she's awful. It seems as though you're severely inconveniencing her when you order and she has to do her job.   I've been here so so many times over the years and absolutely love the food and how quick the service is, but I can no longer get past the crusty attitude of that girl at the counter. She might greet you, rarely looks at you, and if you're lucky you'll get more than one sentence out of her. She's been somewhat decent in the past, but over the past year or two has just been consistently awful (and I'm not the only one who notices).  Again, the food is absolutely amazing, but without the good service from the cash register while ordering, it's just not worth going back anymore. I'm over it, and will go somewhere else.

It's no Pita Jungle, but Pita Pit it's an okay place to grab a bite to eat in Happy Valley. Their selection is kind of small, but they let you create your pita (kind of like Subway). The service is really friendly, and generally they're not that busy (at least when I go about mid-day).   Other than letting you customize your pitas, there's not much else special about Pita Pit. Taste/Flavor factor is maybe a 2 out of 5 stars. Portions that I've gotten are fairly large, but I've heard of people not getting that big of a pita before.  So, Norterra...when are you going to get a Pita Jungle?! Seriously.

Ah-so needs a breakdown of what they're all about, so here it is:  Location: Great! Pretty much the only place to get a variety of sushi in Norterra/Happy Valley.  Restaurant: Different. It's nice inside, but a little strange with the combination of football helmets and ancient Japanese decor. It's like Applebees & P.F. Changs got together and had a baby... a very ugly one.  Food: Amazing! The food nothing to complain about when it comes to taste. I've had a few different sushi rolls and both types of calamari. All of it was delicious.   Service: Terrible. This is where Ah-So fails big time. The service when you walk in isn't very welcoming as you're greeted by an either flustered or snooty hostess. No smiles with "Hello, how are you?", just a blank stare, then a smirk with "How many?". If you're lucky, you may hear a "Welcome to Ah-so" while she's staring down at the seating chart. I like what Jessica H. says: "...it was like we were inconveniencing them, even though there were many many empty tables." So true Jessica!  The waiting area for tables is super small, but that's not really the problem. The problem is WHY we're waiting. Both times I've gone, we've waited for 10-15 minutes when there are at least 5 tables out there with no-one sitting at them, and another 2 or 3 tall tables in the bar area (which is fine for 4 college students). Some have dirty dishes and some are ready to be seated at. However, we all end up sitting there (or standing) waiting and waiting. Mind you, this is just weeknights that we're going, I haven't been brave enough to try a weekend meal there.  When we're finally seated, the fun had only begun. The wait for food is painfully long sometimes. The first time they screwed up my order, which was fine because they ended up giving me the extra calamari for free. But the second time we went I ordered the Vegas roll, it was a good 5-10 minutes before mine came out. Meanwhile, everyone else at the table had already received and finish theirs. Not a good feeling when everyone is waiting for you to finish eating because you're food came out so late.  The only good thing about the service was the last waitress we had was actually quick, nice and somewhat decent.   If I were you, I would take the extra couple minutes and drive to Koi in Arrowhead, or even Sushi Brokers in Scottsdale. If you don't care for sushi and want the steak, just go somewhere else in Norterra. There's definitely plenty of other restaurants with MUCH better service (like Mellow Mushroom or Buffalo Wild Wings).

Came here with a bunch of the crew from work during lunch, and wow! This hidden gem on the corner of Indian School & 48th Street is a must visit if you're in the Arcadia area. The food here is amazing, and there's such a wide variety including delicious tater tots (even sweet potato tater tots) and the mouth watering reuben that I had chosen. You get a good sized portion as well. Thank goodness for take-home boxes!   The restaurant is very spacious, and the staff is really friendly & laid back but get you seated and eating your food in no time. It gets better; the price of the food is VERY reasonable, in fact, I'm kind of shocked how inexpensive they are. A well deserved five stars!

I found my new favorite restaurant!   Setting: the restaurant is beautiful, as expected from Fox Concepts. Its got plenty of seating, but I chose to sit outside. Once outside, I didn't feel like I was attached to a mall at all. The bright white tables, walls and decorative...screen(?) totally put you in this nice, peaceful place. There happened to be a TV where I was sitting, but it was pretty well hidden (not like a typical restaurant that puts giant screens at the center of attention).   Service: the service was amazing from the start. The hostess seated me in less than 5 minutes (probably because I was a party of one due to this being a last minute decision). The waitress was fantastic, and hooked me up with my favorite local brew - Four Peaks: Kilt Lifter. Any place that has local brews is on my good side. The waitress even went as far as pouring the rest of my beer in the glass when I was running low (instead of me pouring it out of the bottle myself), not something I'm used too.  When I ordered my three course meal, everything came fast but in perfect timing (not too fast). It was brought out by someone from the kitchen, and I always had a fresh set of silverware.   Food: This is where it gets REALLY good. I started with the cucumber shrimp cocktail, and it was absolutely amazing. Lots of shrimp, and when combined with the cucumber, cocktail sauce and celery, it was the most perfect combination of flavors. Awesome for a warm September evening.  I had the filet mignon with Yukon potatoes and green beans for my second course. I ordered it medium, and it was spot on. The meat melted in my mouth, and was perfect with the potatoes and a little bit of sauce that was around it. Beans: well, I hate beans, but these were phenomenal.   Dessert was the strawberry shortcake, which someone said was their favorite, so I had to try. It was so fluffy and fresh I wish it didn't have to end. Once again: perfect!  Overall, this is an absolutely amazing restaurant. I came and got the restaurant week special ($30 for three courses), and it was worth every penny. Their normal prices are a bit higher, but I strongly urge you to treat yourself to some incredible food here. It's definitely worth it!

I heard about this place after they started following me on Twitter. Curious by any restaurants I find online, I totally fell in love with their menu. I had to try it!  I went on a pretty slow weekend afternoon, and was surprised by how big the place was. It's kept up nice, has lots of room inside and out to sit, and the service is extremely quick!  I ordered the "Triple Decker" sandwich...the name says it all. It was piled high with meat and loaded with flavor. Sometimes, sandwich places in AZ just miss the mark in flavor and end up dry & bland, but Miracle Mile definitely doesn't. They know how to make a good sandwich.  So excited to find this place...or should I say, they found me! The price? It's about as much as any other place to grab a bite to eat for lunch. Can't complain!

I've come here several times, and every time it's never a disappointment. The food is amazing, the service is great and the restaurant has some pretty cool decor. But, it's definitely not a "hippie" place, probably because it's in such a trendy area.  Service is also pretty quick, although, almost everything I've ordered there has been one of their many unique pizzas. I did order one of their sandwiches once, and it was stuffed with so much, I had to take half of it home. Delicious!

Okay, I know it's just McDonald's, but I feel this particular location deserves a good review.   After moving away from this McDonalds, I realized just how great the service is here. The staff is friendly (all the time) and fast! No waiting at this McDonalds. By the time you pay in the drive-thru, move up to the second window, your food is waiting; fresh and hot!  The food is just what you would expect from McDonalds. So I'm not going to waste my time critiquing  it.

Fatburger and In-N-Out move over!  It was the weekend of CityScapes grand opening, and one of the busiest places was this burger joint. I came here with a friend between concerts, and was amazed by how great the burgers were! Here's the rundown:  The place: nice and clean (however, it was opened for only a few days when I went). They have boxes of peanuts sitting out for you to scoop a bunch and eat while in line, or sitting and enjoying your burger. I'm not a peanut fan, but I thought it was pretty cool! However, they make a mess, even with the crew cleaning the shells up constantly.  The service: friendly and fast. Now, when I went, about half of Phoenix was in the area because of CityScape, so it did take a while to get our burgers, but that was expected with a line out the door (that formed in a matter of minutes). I'm sure on a normal day, the service would be much quicker.  The price: it's...pricey. Yes, you get a good burger, and a "Small" is the size of a normal burger anywhere else, but almost $6? I felt like it was just a tad but too much. However, you can get almost anything you want on the burger for no additional charge. I didn't get fries or a drink (because of the price, and I already had a Pepsi in hand).   Overall, I'm impressed. So far, Five Guys wins my vote as the best burger in Phoenix.

I've been looking for a new place to get a good gyro ever since I moved to the North Valley, and I finally found it! The Greek Pita is amazing all around. Here's a breakdown:  The Food: The gyros are to die for! They're piled so high with meat, onions and loads of sauce! Be sure to order your gyros with EVERYTHING. The fries that come with it are pretty tasty too!  The Service: The lady up front that takes your order is super cool and very sweet. The wait time for your food is pretty short. I went during a busy Sunday lunch (they were packed) and it was only about 5 minutes and I had my food.   The Restaurant: It's really nice inside! Outside, it looks like an everyday Valley strip mall, but inside it's very nice and cozy.   The Price: It's about the same here, as it is everywhere else you go to get Greek food. In comparison to Athens Gyros on Northern and 23rd Ave, it IS a little more expensive at Greek Pita. However, you get quite a bit more on your plate with Greek Pita.   Overall, this place is a must visit if you're looking for a good Greek place in Happy Valley. I'm giving it four stars, only because it's the best in the North Valley, but I'm not quite convinced it's the best out of the entire Phoenix area.
