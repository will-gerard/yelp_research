I usually find a way to finagle a stop at LGO whenever I'm in Phoenix. It's those damn amazing english muffins. And the wine selections. Carbs and booze, they will always be my downfall.  Food wise, there's something delicious for me at every meal which is nice as a vegetarian. The spicy chickpea wraps are especially good since they are tasty and a little more virtuous than a regular sandwich. Back in my meat eating days, I devoured the cobb salad and tuna salad sandwich. In fact, I now have an expensive addition to Bubbies pickles solely because of LGO.  My sweet tooth is always very happy at LGO. The gelato case has lots of great flavors and usually many of them are dairy free. During the holidays, we had an apple cider sorbet that was out of this world. The baked goods are so sinful. A drug rep learned about my love of their pastries and cookies, and she started bringing boxes of the stuff to our office. And, well, I had to quit my job just to stave off obesity. (ok, not really)  I love their retail section too. Their marionberry jam is double what I would normally pay for a jam, but I'll be damned if it doesn't taste amazing with their english muffins The wine section is where most of my dollars go. They have a cool selection, and their prices are comparable to total wine. Staff is very helpful with suggestions, and I know I can get something off the beaten path when I go there.

This is where it all started, my devout love for Postino. I've been coming here so long that I remember when you could still get pizzas brought over from LGO next door. I miss those days!  I mainly go to the Gilbert location since that's where I live, but I still stop by here from time to time. In Gilbert, you can't get wine to go unless the bottle is opened so the Arcadia location is useful for picking up something on the racks to take home. This store is also less busy than Gilbert so I enjoy the peaceful atmosphere at lunchtime.  Postino, thank you for being a friend.

This review isn't about Trader Joe's as an entire company, only this location. I love many of their private label items so I'm at this location at least once a week even though it's 8 miles from my house.  What really bugs me about this store is that I see something in the dairy section that is out of code every single time I go there. Once I pointed out to an employee that some yogurt on the shelf had expired two days ago, and he reacted as if I insulted him personally.  For the cashiers, the customer service is about 50/50. There are a few unfriendly folks with a bit of attitude, but there are plently who go out of their way to strike up a conversation and are very helpful.

I've only had take out from this place. It quickly became an office favorite when we wanted to cheaply engage in gluttony.  I usually get the 3 pupusa combo, and it always lasts me for breakfast and lunch the next day. Pretty good for under 10 bucks. They have a good selection of veggie options for the pupusas, but you had better like cheese! My favorite part is the curtido on top. Any form of pickled cabbage makes me very happy.  I wish service was a bit faster though. We usually had to call in our order about an hour ahead of time, or else the person picking it up got stuck at the restaurant awhile.

I took several dresses and shirts in to this person before a long business trip. It was VERY expensive, but he seemed competent. However, on the trip, I discovered that one of my dresses wasn't completed, and the pins in the shoulders were left in! On the phone he offered me a full refund ($40). When I picked up my now completed dress a week later, he only offered me a $10 credit and then shooed me out of his store. I tore it up right there and vowed never to go back.

A few years ago, I had an unfortunate experience at Artful Tailoring. Recently, the owner reached out to me after reading review. He regretted the situation and wanted to make it right.  I have a back log of clothes that need to be altered so I was happy to meet with him again. I knew he could be trusted with the more complicated items (i.e. anything other than pants that need hemming) because of the work he did for me previously.  This time I had two dresses taken in at the shoulders and a pair of jeans taken in at the waist. The first dress had embroidery at the shoulders so he did an "easy fix" that involves folding the material. I was a little hesistant at first, but it looks good and fits even better. I've never had jeans taken in before so I was worried how they would turn out. Now my beloved mint jeans fit perfectly with just two small darts sewn in the back. They aren't really noticable, and besides, I usually wear my shirts untucked anyways.  All the work was ready when promised. I'll be back soon to have some more clothing shortened to fit my midget frame.

Swaddee, what happened?! I used to love you. I guess now that I've been exposed to really wonderful, flavorful Thai, your restaurant just isn't as appealing to me as it was 10 years ago.  My husband and I dined at the Chandler location recently since it's near his work. He got the house salad which was just a standard salad with bland peanut dressing. What upset him is that the "shrimp" listed in the description was just that-- ONE SHRIMP, singular.  I got the spicy eggplant figuring that would be a good choice since eggplant is in season. It was just ok. I tasted more grease than anything else, but I was missing all those hot/sour/sweet/bitter elements that I expect with Thai food.  Luckily there are other Thai places in the area. It's time to move on.

After visiting this store and a couple other locations, I can officially say I'm a Sur La Table girl rather than Williams Sonoma. Sur La Table has a much better selection and better service. If anything, SLT people tend to be overly eager to help, but I'll take that over being ignored at Williams Sonoma.  During my last trip to SLT, I needed an apple corer so my husband could make some culinary abomination called a "potato bomb." The salesgirl showed me no less than 5 versions and helped me select the best one for our needs.   I also got a mini loaf pan (their brand) that is now my favorite piece of bakeware. The pan is nice and heavy and coated in silicon so you don't have to use any butter or spray. The coating makes it very easy to wash too.  Another reason I prefer SLT is because they carry scharffen berger chocolate. It's the best stuff, and you can't tell me otherwise. I can't see myself buying other food items there however. Their cake decorations were ridiculously over priced, as in $15 for sprinkles.  What really draws me in at SLT is the clearance sections throughout the store. I picked up a 4qt Staub in a SLT-exclusive green color for $50 off. I'm a sucker for a good bargain, and that one made me giddy.

I came here involutarily with a group of 10 for a family birthday celebration. Not my side of the family, of course, but it's one of the sacrafices you make when you get married.  To psych myself up, I got there early to catch the tail end of happy hour. I was decently impressed with the black tea gimlet. It was served in a coupe glass, and the St. Germain made it sweet and smooth.  I ordered the Buddah's Feast steamed because I didn't want to deal with the usual 5 pounds of water weight gain that comes from consuming quadruple the RDA of sodium in one meal.   When our food was brought out, there was lots of confusion. The two servers started auctioning off our food, yelling down the table. One of the meals was wrong, and three other entrees came in its place. My entree was no where to be seen. I'm surprised they dropped the ball so badly. I thought part of the reason you eat at a souless, corporate grubateria was to experience a well-oiled machine that is able to execute orders correctly and efficiently. Splitting the checks was also a bumpy, drawn out experience.  Hopefully, I won't have to come here again.

I stopped in here to feed my enchilada-style burrito craving, something that should only be done at a small, hole-in-wall place serving Sonoran style food. Espo's fit the bill on that account, and it has gotten some good reviews recently so I decided to try it out after shopping at nearby Chandler mall.  Right off the bat, I noticed the place was kind of dirty. I wasn't expecting anything immaculate, but I've seen nicer Filiberto's. The tile floor badly needs a mopping.  My veggie burrito came out quickly and steaming hot. It was mostly a disappointment after that. First off, no sour cream or guacamole came with it which is my expectation for enchilada style. The red sauce was tasty with a very nice kick to it. I still added lots of salsa too which I also enjoyed. But there was way too much of the average tortilla, and the filling was a major letdown. Was I wrong to expect that a veggie burrito would contain veggies? Shredded iceberg doesn't count! The beans were too liquidy, and the rice had little flavor.  This place did nothing for me, but luckily there's plenty of other burritos in the sea.

They are on the expensive side for drycleaning ($9 for a trench coat), but I was very happy with their alterations.  I waited until the last minute to get some dress pants hemmed up for a trip. The alterations place at San Tan that I previously used wanted to charge me $50!! CASH!! to hem two pairs of pants with a two day turnaround. S K did a great job for less than half that. I dropped off my pants at noon Monday and picked them up at 5pm Wednesday.  I'm pretty short and love ill-fitting bargain clothes from Last Chance so I'll definitely be using them again.

Huh, I must really be missing something here. This was so not the 5-star experience I was expecting based on previous reviews. Perhaps I just don't enjoy getting my nails done as much as the other ladies of Gilbert. We came here on a early weekday afternoon, and it was packed! I counted at least 15 customers in the salon.  The manager was very friendly. We picked out our colors during our short wait, and I was pleased they carried lots of Essie and OPI colors. My nail tech was bad. First, she had the water scalding hot in the foot tub. The pedi was on the painful side, and the leg scrub they used in an unmarked bottle seemed kind of sketchy. She was rude about the light color nail polish that I chose (because it required an extra coat?), and she made an insulting remark about my unshaved legs. Sorry, but I come from an infectious diseases background, and I'm not going to risk getting a bacterial or fungal infection from the pedicure tub.  The manicure was bad too. She nicked my cuticles in a couple places, and the harsh chemicals used gave me a ton of hangnails the next day. She started filing my nails into a square shape without even asking my preference. The techs also ask for payment before the manicure starts which is awkward.  If this trip to Elite Nails served no other purpose, it helped cement in my mind that I don't like strip mall nail salons, and I am better off paying twice as much at an upscale day spa.  **update- I had to take this review down to one star after seeing what has happened to my nails after this manicure (see picture). I must be having a reaction to some chemical that they use. My nails are starting to separate from the nail beds. Doesn't look good. I've never had this problem with any previous manicure.

This was more of a 3.5 start experience as far as taste goes, but I'll round up for good prices, quick service and aesthetics.  Seriously, check out the picture of my pizza. What a good looking margherita! I was surpised how scrumptious it looked coming from a tiny strip mall place.  Overall, the taste was good but didn't blow me away. My favorite parts were the delicious, high quality cheese and heavy dose of garlic. The sweet sauce and thicker crust reminded me of a stepped-up Domino's.

Love this place! First, big props to Mr. Johnston for renovating an old (for Gilbert) buidling instead of doing a tear-down which is more common in the Valley. My architect cousin was seriously impressed with the structure. I remember Liberty Market when it was a ghetto liquor store that sold some decent chorizo. It's wonderful to have this space turned into a great restaurant where you can meet up with friends for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Breakfast is yummy. I always get the veggie scramble being a vegetarian. It's loaded with goat cheese so what's not to love? Biscuits, cinnamon buns, and sticky buns are fantastic.  For lunch and dinner, I stick with the caprese salad or sandwich. Their thin crust pizza is very good, but the caprese is exceptional so it's hard to venture from it. I've had this dish all over town and while some places may have better bread (pane bianco), the actual fillings are so much better at Liberty Market. The other item I have a hard time straying from is the sweet potato salad. It's unreal! No mayo here, instead it's tossed with chipotle (i think) flavored oil, craisins, and pecans. On a side note, I would love it if Liberty would over some veggie meat option a la Capriotti's so that I could try their other sandwiches.  Desserts all kick ass. I've had the red velvet and carrot cakes here, both some of the best I've had. If you're only going to get one dessert, make it the bread pudding. A friend of mine who lived in France for two years said it was the best in the world. It totally is! It's a great value two considering you can share it among 3+ adults.  If you come here for nothing else, you must have some coffee. As a coffee drinker, it would be an abomination for me to visit Liberty and not get something from the E61 bar. The last time I went I got an iced latte, and I was actually mad because it was *so* good. Mad, as in "Why isn't all espresso this good?" and "Why don't I drink this every day?"

This is, hands-down, our favorite Indian restaurant, and really, it's our favorite restaurant in the Valley. They won us over long ago with their consistently excellent food and service, but they really won our undying allegiance by being open on Christmas Day.  We almost always order a korma dish. It is lush and creamy with a bit of sweetness. Being a vegetarian, I love all their paneer dishes especially the saag paneer and paneer tikka. In my meat-eating days, I was head over heels with any shrimp dish. They always use big, plump suckers not sad little dried out bay shrimp like some other places. Their basmati is way better than the other Indian places in town. They actually flavor it properly. Garlic naan is, of course, heavenly.  Service is quick and friendly. Over the six years dining at Royal Taj, we have never had a bad moment or slip up. This place really is a gem, and I hope more people give it a shot. It's never crowded which is nice, but we're constantly worried it will go out of business.

I stopped here on my way back from Sedona. After hearing and reading so much about their pie, I decided to snag a rhubarb crumb for my husband since that's his favorite. I even ordered my pie over the phone the day before, but that turned out to be unnecessary and seemed to cause confusion with the staff.  For a place renowned for their pies, the $19 rhubarb crumb was quite disappointing. My homemade all-butter pie crust tastes much better than their shortening-based one. The rhubarb filling was way too tart and gelatinous. It was edible with some vanilla ice cream.  At least the bathrooms are clean if you need a potty stop along the I-17 during your road trip.

Vegas must be seriously hard up for some donuts if this is considered the best place in the city. We got the much raved-about apple fritter and a cinnamon twist, and they were below supermarket quality. They were a waste of calories which is why I usually avoid donuts in the first place. Based on the reviews, I thought the Ronald's would be exceptional.  The coffee was godawful. It was our first coffee of the morning which is always badly needed, but we couldn't get down more than a few sips.  Service was friendly, and prices were good, however.

I've seen a quite a few shows here, both comics and musical acts. I'm happy with the venue and definitely prefer it to the stadiums or outdoor pavilions. I love the downtown location as it makes it easy to combine dinner and a show. I'm too cheap to buy drinks at a concert venue, so the location makes it easy to hit up a bar afterwards.  As far as the basics go, the acoustics are fine, security isn't too dickish, and there's a decent amount of bathrooms. I haven't had any problems with the temperature in the venue as others have. The merch area could be better organized though. It always seems like a cluster.  For concerts, I would recommend the GA tickets. They're usually cheaper than the orchestra seats, and it feels like a more initimate experience.

This is an excellent emergency vet, and it's one of the few things I miss about my old ghetto neighborhood since moving to Gilbert.  I had to bring in each of my 3 rescue dogs to this location during the last couple of years. We were always seen quickly. We were never pushed to do any extra tests/xrays etc. like at some vets. In fact, it was cheaper bringing in my dog to VCA post dog-fight than my regular vet because VCA simply treated the puncture wounds with cleansing and antibiotics. When we brought our dog into our regular vet previously with similar (and less serious) injuries, she ordered xrays and put him under anesthesia to stitch him up.  Staff is compassionate which is helpful for freaked out newbie dog parents like us. It's hard to leave your baby in someone else's hands, but they made us feel safe and were always quick to call with updates. One time when we picked up our little guy, the ladies at the front desk were taking turns holding him because he was wimpering in his crate.  We had a major emergency a couple years ago (my dog's eye had to be removed after a trauma). Dr. Tan performed the surgery, and the results were outstanding. Boo Boo looks great! They kept her overnight to keep her pain under control, but they didn't charge us anything extra. They also didn't charge for any of the post-op follow ups.  If it is feasible, I will drive the extra 20 minutes to VCA rather than going to the emergency vet in Gilbert.

I quite like the opthamologist, Dr. Wasserman. He was very gentle with my dog which made the exam less traumatic for the both of us. All my questions were answered, and I never felt like the doc was trying to push any unnecessary tests or meds on me.  I am less pleased with the emergency side of the office. When we took our dog due to fluid accumulation in his chest, the vet started talking about putting him on oxygen, keeping him overnight, and getting a cardiac consult which would be at least $1000 *just for the consult*  Luckily, the emergency vet was able to get ahold of our regular cardiologist who suggested the best course of action and allowed our dog to come home with us.  Sadly, our sweet boy passed away a few days later. They were great about taking him in for cremation. The cremains were ready when promised, and they were nice enough to send us a sympathy card.  Which makes it all the more disturbing that a couple months later, they sent us a postcard to remind us to bring in our dead dog for a follow-up eye exam.

Love the acts I've seen here but hate the venue. As others have said, security sucks, and the bathrooms are gross.  Would it kill them to turn on the AC? It is crazy, stifling hot in the Marquee. Is this a way to sell drinks? Plan on wearing as little as possible so you don't faint from heat exhaustion.  I don't get their super-long will call lines either. Why make most shows mandatory will call if you only have two windows to distribute tickets?  Don't worry if you have a long wait though. The band won't start without you because no one ever starts before 9pm. Again, another way to sell drinks.  I would strongly discourage any woman from buying a drink at the Marquee. I know of at least 3 women who have had very strange reactions (including blacking out) after having a couple drinks here.  Just play it safe and stick with bottled water.

Holy cow! I love Green! It's awesome to have a menu full of nothing but vegan dishes in a somewhat veg-unfriendly city like Phoenix.  My carnivore husband loves it too and talks it up to people just as glowingly as I do.  They always have great specials. Just recently they had a great turkey pesto sandwhich which sounds kind of ordinary, but it was way better than anything I can make at home. Their taco special with mock shredded beef was killer. They even have a Big Wac if you miss that nasty burger from McDonald's.  My favorite dishes are the No Harm Chicken Parm and Meatball sandwich. Their marinara is so flavorful! Lots of garlic, just how I like it. When I lived 10 minutes away and got take out, I could barely keep myself from eating while I was driving because it smelled sooooo good.  When I'm aiming for something healthier, I get their stir-frys with extra fresh tofu, no rice. Apricot miso is my favorite of the bunch. Salads are great too, but then I usually feel compelled to order a delicious tsoynami to undo their health benefits.

Gammage is an architectural gem. I love the unique design that makes it a landmark in the east valley. However, the interior of Gammage would really benefit from another architect coming in and remodeling the horrid bathroom situation. If you're female, come parched to your musical or risk standing in a 25 deep line. I've been at theaters in NYC that are a third of the size of Gammage but have triple the stalls.   Acoustics aren't great here, and there always seems to be a problem with the sound system. The levels are usually off. The vocals never seem loud enough, and they usually cut out at some point in the show.  Parking is can be bad, but I've learned to use the metered spots that surround the outside perimeter of the main parking lot. I've never gotten a ticket, and it beats the parking garage behind Gammage.  I used to always buy tickets on the second tier because I'm cheap like that, but I got tired of being directly under the massive AC vents and nearly freezing to death. All the floor seats have great views. Avoid the top balcony because your view may be blocked.

I haven't been to Thai Basil in a couple years since we're usually not in Tempe. I remember liking it previously so I was happy to stop here when our other lunch plans fell through.  The soup that came with the lunch special had unusually sweet broth. Unfortunately, this carried over to my entree as well. I love pad thai, but I could barely eat my dish because the sauce was cloyingly sweet. I ordered medium heat which was very mild so adding some extra chili sauce helped combat some of the sweetness.  My husband got the green curry which he liked, but not nearly as much as our neighborhood place. The portion was pretty small, and he left hungry.  We were happy with the quick service during a busy lunch hour. I wouldn't come back here though.

My sister and I did a quick weekend Vegas trip and decided to stay here because we like downtown and got a good rate. Parking was very crazy as is to be expected on a Friday night. The valet was full, but a very helpful bellman helped me to maneuver around all the cars after taking care of our luggage.  We stayed in an upgraded room in the Gold Tower, and it was plenty big for two people. The amenities are decent, and I loved the huge, soft bed. My sister has stayed at the Golden Nugget before, so she knew to bring some cups for the Keurig machine. That helped us avoid wasting time and money at Starbucks. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants since there are plenty of better choices within easy walking distance.   The pool area is a big draw, and it's pretty chaotic. Luckily, there's another pool on the second level that is smaller and a little more serene. You do have to pay an entry fee, but you get assigned your own giant chaise lounge. Plus, no kids running and screaming around the pool!   The service at the Golden Nugget was exceptionally good. You can tell they really train their staff well. Every employee greeted us when we walked down the halls, and they would always hold the elevator for us. I would happily return on my next Vegas trip.

I met a friend, a Vegas local, at Nora's per her suggestion. It's very close to the Gold Coast where I usually stay (I'm a bingo addict) and away from all the Strip madness. The atmosphere is still great even if the neighborhood isn't all that nice.   The food is pretty good. Not the most fantastic stuff I've ever had, but I've enjoyed every dish I've had there. It's definitely better than Fiamma in MGM and about half the price. Vodka penne has been my favorite so far.   What really stands out are the cocktails. They have some interesting house cocktails on the menu that were really delicious. I have a decent knowledge of liquors thanks to my cocktail-enthusiast husband, but Nora's had a few things I've never heard of that were fun to try. I loved their Pimm's Cup --so refreshing during summer in the desert.  I just realized I've never had dessert here. Gotta go back on my next visit!

My husband and I usually go to Vegas during our birthdays in early August so I was happy to get a free room offer from the Riviera after joining their players club. I was mindful that Riviera wouldn't be particulary nice, but hey, free is free.   The room iteself is ok. It's a decent size, and the furniture, though out of date, isn't any worse than the one at the old tower at Caesar's. I liked the bed, but I missed having a nice, snuggly comforter. Bath tolietries were better than expected. We were right next to the pool, and it's a good thing we didn't plan on sleeping in because the shitty pop music starts blasting in around 8am.  It was easy to get around the hotel and casino area. Gambling here was fine, but we seemed to have better luck across the street at Circus Circus. There was a cool gambling promo advertised in the room (1st $1000 on us!), but it had since expired. I was disappointed that the bingo room closed as well.  The two big negatives was the buffett and parking. Both were sketchy as hell. I had oatmeal so bad that Oliver Twist would have turned his nose up at it. I think they used triple the amount of water that they were supposed to, and the water was obtained from a mop bucket. Parking was very inconvient and poorly marked.   I'm hesitant to stay here again even if the room is comped.

Yes, this place is chaotic, messy and a bit scary sometimes, but if you're a cheap bitch like me, the juice is worth the squeeze!   Consider this, Nordstrom takes back any item at any time without a receipt. All those returns across the country make their way to Last Chance for your shopping pleasure. There are some serious bargains to be had, and I could list off all my favorite finds over the last few years. However, I'll just give you some of my favorite tips.  1. Know what you want ahead of time to make shopping less overwhelming. I always have a few ideas in mind to focus my efforts.  2. Bring a friend who knows your tastes and size. Many items are misplaced so it's good to have another person to cover more ground.   3. Allow a couple hours for some serious shopping. All that scouring takes time, and then you have to deal with the dressing room line. At least they got rid of the open areas so you can preserve some modesty.  4. Know your designers and pricing so you can decide if your item if really a worthwhile bargain. Ideally, you should be paying 10-20% of retail.  5. Inspect carefully! I've found some weird holes and sketchy stains after the fact because I got too rushed.  Happy hunting!

It had been over a year since I visited Vegas (the horror!) so I had a long time to build up LOS in my mind as I anticipated my next trip. I heard great things about the restaurant from some local foodies, and hundreds of Yelp reviews echoed the same praise.  Our 30 minute wait went by quickly as we read all the articles about LOS in the lobby. We were hungry and overwhelmed by the menu, but our waiter was very helpful in making suggestions. He brought over the sommelier to help us find a wine that would go with our dishes. The Riesling was an absolute knockout and an astounding value at $38.  The waiter recommended the duck panang for my husband and drunken noodles with tofu for me. My husband was in love with his dish despite the fact that he usually is indifferent about duck. He said the crispy skin reminded him of cracklins, only better. I loved my drunken noodles too. The thick, wide rice noodles were drowning in a great brown sauce and topped with fried tofu and basil. We finished up with fried bananas and ice cream (the mango was unavailable). The server who brought it out instructed us on the best way to eat the dish, something I always appreciate.  It was a spectacular meal and lives up to the "best Thai in the country" reputation. We've been recommending LOS to all our friends with the gentle reminder to ignore the gay bathhouse in the same strip mall.

I'm sort of hanging my head in shame writing this review because I'm normally very vocal and blunt about my hatred of chain restaurants. However, my heart swells with joy when I think about all the vegetarian options available at Yard House.   I wish more restaurants would follow suit and use meat analogues like Gardein or Quorn. It's so refreshing to have a large selection to choose from instead of a veggie burger or portobello sandwich. I'm at a bar; I want buffalo wings, dammit!  Thankfully, their awesome veggie buffalo wings are on the happy hour menu. My sister and I split an order, we each got two drinks, and our bill was only $26!  When you're organizing a large group, it's hard to find a place that will please everyone. Many of my acquaintances are fearful of ethnic food and/or independent restaurants so often I have to surrender and eat at a boring chain restaurant. Now Yard House will always be my first choice.

Previously, I have written a glowing review for the Sunrise location, and every bit of it still rings true. I tend to go to this location more often though, and recently, it was the first time I had brought my husband and dogs with me.  Our server fussed over our pups and brought them water so major bonus points for that. She also made sure we had patio heater nearby. Even though there was only one other occupied table outside, we were still checked on frequently.  I had a lovely vegetarian omelette, but I was really crazed over my banana nut muffin. It was better than I remember, and it was actually steaming in the cold weather. I felt bad for all the yum noises I was making because my husband is gluten free. Speaking of which, when the waitress asked what bread he wanted on the side, he said none, and she offered to bring him a side of fruit. He was very appreciative. My husband declared his corned beef hash to be the best he's ever had, and he might have gotten a second order if he didn't have part of my meal to finish off.  The Egg & I will continue to be a "must-visit" when we come to Vegas.

My husband and I love Indian food, and Udupi has fast become a favorite. We've been for both the lunch buffet and regular dinner service.  The gobi manchurian gets mentioned quite a bit because it's awesome. Sadly, I haven't seen it at the lunch buffet yet, but it's a must order at dinner. The chole batura is another favorite Southern Indian dish, and Udupi's version is great. The puffy batura reminds me of a lighter version of fry bread, and the chickpeas are wonderfully spiced.  The lunch buffet is lots of fun. Delicious masala dosai are brought to the table, and they will even bring you a second helping. Not that there isn't tons more to choose from at the buffet. The Northern style curries like saag paneer and aloo gobi are pretty good, but the Southern dishes are better. We love getting the coconut studded rice here. So different than the basmati served at other Indian places. The sambar is really spicy, and I love dipping the pleasantly sour idli into it. I would skip the paratha though as it tastes more like a plain tortilla. We always finish up with dessert to put out the fire although we're usually bursting at the seams at that point. It's great when you can get stuffed with terrific food you couldn't possibly make at home for less than $10 per person.  We'll still stick with our long-time favorite, Nandini, for Northern dishes, but Udupi is top for Southern Indian.

I'm going to be an uptight stickler here, and only review the pizzeria portion of LGO since the grocery part can be done under as a separate business. I hope others follow suit. Sorry, I'm super nerdy about this stuff.  Anyways, the sourdough crust is my favorite pizza crust in all the land. I love the flavor and how it's always glistening with oil when it comes to the table. The toppings are really special here. If you even remotely like avocado, get their avocado pizza. The lemon zest puts it over the top. The corn with goat cheese is my next favorite. The only one that I haven't liked is the the rocket man. It tasted fine, but the heavy toppings were too much for the thin crust.  We also had the fortune of trying their grilled artichoke appetizer one evening. I couldn't get enough of it! It's not on the menu (seasonal item I'm sure), but we asked about it when we saw plates of it go by.  Extra bonus points for the large selection of cheap pizza wines. Any time I can get a decent bottle at a restaurant for under $20, I'm a happy camper.

Just another rave for Penzey's. I'm so glad I finally starting buying my spices here. I resisted for years thinking the quality couldn't be that much different than what's available at the grocery store. I also wrongly assumed they would be more expensive. Thank goodness I finally saw the light.  Over the years, I've become a vegetarian and started eating whole foods diet. Weaning myself off of frozen meals means I spend a lot of my free time cooking and baking from scratch. All of the time spent in the kitchen helped me realize how important it is to use the best ingredients that I can afford.  What I love about Penzey's is that all their spices are available as 1/4 cups jars. Not only does this save a bunch of space, it's ensures that you will have faster turnover of your spice inventory. Usually a 1/4 cup is more than enough to last you for a year or two. For things I use frequently, I buy the larger bag and refill the small jars as needed. Their empty containers are also cheap. I got a 16oz jar to make it easier to measure salt when I'm cooking.  As I stated before, I really though Penzey's would be more expensive since they are a specialty shop. I was happily proven wrong. Even whole spices like cardamom pods and cumin seeds are similarly priced to Lee Lee's or Mekong. As a baker, I'm a nut for their Vietnamese cinnamon and double strength vanilla. These are definitely gourmet items so it wouldn't be fair to compare them to inferior versions found at Fry's, but Penzey's is way cheaper than Sur La Table or Williams Sonoma.

A couple times a week, I go to a gym right next to Joe's Real BBQ, and I'm so thankful I'm a vegetarian because the smell coming from their smoker would undo my entire workout otherwise.  So am I qualified to review Joe's even though I abstain from meat? Absolutely. I ate many meaty meals at Joe's in my teens and 20s. I actually worked there when I was a senior in high school, and I managed to gain the freshman 15 before starting college.  Back in the day, my favorite was the turkey breast. I dare you to find a more moist piece of white meat. Runner-up was the pulled pork, mostly because I loved to smother it in pickles and marinated onions. I'm not gonna lie; my mouth is watering just thinking about the condiments. My best friend, a North Carolina native, loves their pulled pork because they toss it in a vinegar-based sauce in true NC style. My husband and his friends all go gaga over the ribs, and brisket seems to be a crowd pleaser.  Nowadays, I stick with the side dishes. I love the cheesy potatoes (add scallions and douse in green tabasco) and mac and cheese. The apple sauce, potato salad, and cole slaw are all items I'm not normally a fan of, but at Joe's they are way above average and very delicious.  The restaurant has a great atmosphere. It's a great place to take kids, large groups, and out of towners. It is spotlessly clean too. A pharmacy school classmate used to do restaurant inspections, and she said Joe's was always immaculate. Service is wonderful too. It says a lot about a restaurant when employees have stayed 10+ years.  On another note, I would encourage anyone who needs a caterer to consider Joe's Real BBQ. Everyone will love it, and their rates are very affordable. I used them for my wedding and a housewarming party. Just last week, they catered my sister's wedding, and they really went above and beyond for her to make sure her day went smoothly. Keeping her happy was no small feat!

I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine. To clarify, not the blandest Indian food that I have ever eaten. The blandest food period.  I appreciate them trying to serve healthful Indian food, but there is no excuse not to use all those wonderful Indian spices.   Nothing was good about the food. My husband and I eat a lot of Indian food, and we couldn't believe how void of flavor everything was. I think this place is why we stopped bothering to find a good Indian place when we visit Vegas.

Binkley's is in the upper echelon of Phoenix fine dining, and I figured my birthday was a good time to splurge on this culinary experience. Unfortunately, I walked away disappointed, and my husband left hungry. That's unacceptable for a $300 meal (not including wine).  There were definitely some highlights like my risotto and his waygu beef which we paid a $16 and $24 supplement for respectively. My sweet corn risotto was sublime. However, the shaved fresh truffles on top were exciting to see, but ultimately, did not provide much flavor. My husband said his beef was some of the best he's had, but there were only two bites of it on his plate. I liked what they did with beverages. The digestif siphoned right at the table was surprisingly delicious and refreshing. They also brought out a nice grapefruit soda in tiny soda bottles as a palate cleanser. I also really liked my baked goat cheese  topped with peppadews and pistachios that I had in lieu of dessert. The braised carrot and porcini doughnut amouse-bouches were also memorable.  Lowlights started with the famous sloppy joe's. The bread was stale, and my vegetarian version was just a speck of spinach with a dollop of goat cheese. The flash frozen grapefruit was bland. My cold appetizer was a salad topped with apples, blue cheese and caramel popcorn. How boring. The wet butter lettuce needed more time in the salad spinner.  What was truly abysmal was my entree. There aren't any vegetarian entrees listed on the menu, but that's not uncommon. Usually the chef can put together something tasty, and I was excited to see what chef Binkley would do for me.  What I got was absolutely the LAMEST vegetarian entree that I've ever had. It was barely warm and unseasoned black beans (I hope not out of a can) with roasted baby squash. I could throw together a better vegetarian meal in 20 minutes using just pantry items. This dish was just a spectacular disappointment. It's not as if I was throwing them a curveball either. I indicated on our reservations that I'm a vegetarian. I wanted to just sit at the table and give the dish the stink eye, but my husband ate it for me because he was still starving.   We left poorer, one of us needing another meal, and one of use pouting about getting the shaft as a vegetarian once again.

AZ Wine is a nice change of pace from Total Wine. It's nice to shop at a place that has a different inventory, and the staff at AZ Wine is much more knowledable. A few years ago, my husband and I ate at Atlas Bistro next door, and the guy working there helped us a find a wine that complimented both his lamb and my seafood dish.  The prices are great too which is important because that's the only reason I shop so much at Total Wine. We found a bottle of Dos Cabezas El Campo for $5 cheaper.  The customer service is wonderful too. The gentleman working during our visit last week was attentive without being intrusive. He also did us a big favor by holding our 4 bottles at the store while we went to dinner so we didn't have to leave them in the car to be ruined.  Hopefully we will be back soon for a wine tasting!

We decided to give this place a shot because they have a good looking happy hour, and it's very close to our home. My sister said their veggie roll was good. It was, but everything else was a disappointment.  There was only one other table occupied and a couple at the bar, yet our server was slow and forgot to bring out several items. Our sushi, something that relies on great presentation, was served on chipped white china. We're talking huge chips here. I can't believe they didn't throw the pieces out.  The food was all pretty bad. I got the egg nigiri, and it was the worst I've ever had. How do you screw up what is essentially an omelette on rice? My husband liked his pink lady roll (not on happy hour), but the 4 other rolls and nigiri he downed only out of ravenous hunger.  If you live in this area, stick with Sakana for well-priced decent sushi.

So normally I don't go for Filly-B's if I'm sober, but it looked so damn appealing on our way to Vegas last week. Compared to BK, McD's, and the Yum! Brand chains, Filiberto's was the lesser of those evils.  It was relatively clean, cheap as always, and pretty tasty for road food. We were going to eat at Taco Bell (best choice in Wickenburg for vegetarian), but I'm glad we crossed the parking lot to Filiberto's. I prefer real sour cream versus the stuff shot out from a gun. Pico de gallo! And the tortillas are so much better than those plasticky discs. Decent red and green salsa.  We'll stop here again on our next Vegas trip.

These guys did a great job installing our new Trane HVAC unit when our old junker went on the fritz in August. The prices were very fair, and the owner worked with me to ensure that I got the full $1500 government tax credit. Nearly two years later, the unit still works perfectly.  This company and its owner are honest and reliable. What more do you need from a service vendor? I would use them again in a heartbeat.

Gilbert Pizza has been around for a few years, but I've never eaten there before. Now I know why.  The pizza is some of the worst I ever had, all in part to the awful crust. Jean G. described it to a T. The crust is mind-bogglingly bland. It actually takes flavor away from the toppings. In our case, we got a margherita which had decent mozzarella and fresh (not baked until crisp) basil. I probably should have known something was up with this place when I saw the margherita advertised as "new" on the menu.  The crust is way too thick to be considered a thin crust pie. Thank god there was peppers, parmesean, and garlic powder on the table. Like a shitty supermarket frozen pizza, this baby needed to be doctored up!  Garlic knots were the only saving grace. Appropriately greasy with plently of garlic and served very warm.  Service was ok. Our order was taken quickly, and the food came out right away. They never came back to check on us, but I'm sort of glad they didn't so that I wouldn't have to lie when they asked how I liked the food. I found it kind of weird that their self-serve soda machine doesn't have a water spout. Instead, the waitress has to go behind the bar to fill up glasses.  No big deal, though. It's not like we'll ever be back.

We don't to come here as often as we would like since it's a bit of a drive from Gilbert, but Hana is definitely our favorite Japanese restaurant in town. Besides the great food and service, we also love the no-corkage BYOB. We usually bring a white wine, and they make sure to put it in an ice bucket for us.  Hana has a good variety of well executed classics and lots of unique specials. The Hana tamago was recently featured in the Republic's food section with good reason. It's a really cool dish featuring a tempura battered soft boiled egg set on top of a delicious creamy sauce. Get it and don't share! I also had the heirloom tomato sashimi a few months ago and loved it. As a vegetarian, it's great to see a sushi chef's attention to detail extended to veggies as well.  My husband is the meat eater in the family so he has got to enjoy some awesome seafood dishes. Most recently, he had a beautiful looking lobster dish (his favorite of the night) and an entire grilled squid. He also had high praises for a tuna roll topped with fried garlic as well.  We are really looking forward to coming back with friends and family so we can share Hana's goodness.

I love having this place in my neighborhood, just a mere 800 steps from my front door. The menu appeals to everyone, from foodies to Applebee's addicts. It's a unique spot that's great for taking out of town visitors.  Service has been great the many times I've come here. The restaurant is run efficiently, and the few times that we've run into problems (like a burnt pizza), the situation is remedied quickly. My dog once escaped and ran to Joe's (can you blame him?), and the manager was sweet enough to feed him chicken and watch over him until I could leave work to pick him up.  I love that they added a veggie burger to the menu. It's a good one, too! It comes with a vegan 1000 island dressing, but I like to have it topped with the fixings from the fontina burger. Their portobello burger is one of my favorites which says a lot because as a vegetarian, I've eaten my body weight in "token vegetarian option" sandwiches. It has an awesome grilled flavor and is simply dressed. I love the grilled pizza too. No one near by does this, and the leftovers make an awesome breakfast.  Speaking of which, breakfast at Joe's Farm Grill is wonderful. My husband swears their pancakes are the best he's ever had at a restaurant, very close to his mother's version. He also goes gaga over the ribs and waffles (but a nap is required afterwards) and the breakfast tacos. I usually get the veggie scramble with a salad, grilled flatbread, and a great fruit cup that *doesn't* include cheapo grapes and cantaloupe.   Lastly, I just have to say how happy I am that they finally took the endless loop of Guy Fieri off their TV monitors. Good decision!

I am delighted to have this place within walking distance of my house. It's a great place to have brunch with the neighbors, meet a friend for lunch, or just kill some time while you wait for your cleaning ladies to finish up.  I get iced coffee a lot, and I appreciate the stevia packets nearby since they dissolve quickly. Their chai is very good, more sweet than spicy.   Breakfast is wonderful especially since they added some new menu items like the rosa sandwich with egg whites and pesto. I also love the vegan benedict. They really know how to season and cook tofu properly. The San Diegan is everyone's favorite; I sub avocado for bacon.  Lunch is great too. The tomato basil sandwich is one of the best veggie sandwhiches I've ever had. I often make my own version at home during the summer. The vegan taco salad wrap is killer too. I gave half to a meat and potatoes coworker, and he loved it! My husband and neighbor both love the turkey cranberry sandwich and order it almost every time we go.  They are known for their desserts for good reason. Scones are my favorite, perhaps because they contain an almost lethal amount of butter. The vegan red velvet cupcake is much better than the one at Sprinkles. I'm sure that it helps that it's made by an actual vegan (one of the co-owners).  I was hesitant to try the coffee and cigarettes cupcake, but my curiosity finally got to me. I was surprised how much I liked it. It was like a more flavorful and complex vanilla. I've never smoked so I couldn't taste the tobacco, but my husband said the tobacco flavor is there.

This reminds me of that "putting lipstick on a pig" saying. Sure, Sundrops is much prettier and more upscale than your typical strip mall nail place, but the experience and results were no different.  I found the tech, Rakhil, to be very rude. I realize some of it was due to cultural differences, but geez, she's in a service industry. I felt awful when she rolled her eyes at me a few times during our conversations. This is why I avoid the Vietnamese places as I have always found the techs to be too blunt and insulting.  The mani-pedi was painful, and it made one of my fingers bleed. Luckily, no infection. I paid an extra $10 for the callous remover, but it didn't help at all. The Essie paint is very cute, but I'll give myself the credit for picking out a unique color (mint apple).  I'm glad I had the groupon to give it a shot, but there's no way I'll ever go back.

I'm feeling a little generous with this review. The food deserves 3 stars overall, but the pepper tofu is so out of this world delicious that I'm willing to bump them up to 4. As a vegetarian in Phoenix, I'm always starved for entree options, and I wish there were more dishes like this. I got this dish to go while I waited for my car to be serviced nearby, and a couple employees walked by to tell me how good my lunch smelled. I asked for it extra spicy, and the extra jalapenos added just enough heat.  I came back again with my husband to try some of their veggie pho, and I was disappointed. It was good but nothing special. My husband felt the same way about his beefy pho. We shared a plate of spring rolls, and they were so bland. Even the peanut dipping sauce had very little flavor.  We would still come back to try other dishes here. A big lure was the large wine list where all bottles are $20. The great $20 price tag puts many of the bottles right a retail cost which is awesome when you're dining out. Sign me up for some La Crema.

Your pets want you to shop local too!   Goober was recommended to me by the rescue that I got my first dog. Six years later, I still use them, and I've been very happy with their customer service.  If you don't see an item you want, give them a call. They are happy to place special orders. My dogs always eat Sojo's mix which isn't on the Goober website, but I can order it from them for the same price as buying online. They deliver for free, and I'm able to patronize a local business. Win-win!

I've been wanting to try Sushi Eye in Motion for awhile. My husband and I used to like the one in Tempe (back before I became a vegetarian), and I wanted to see the conveyer belt concept in action. When my dad surprised us with a Living Social voucher, we headed over there the first chance we got.  I won't bore you with the details of the beginning of our meal. It all started to go terribly wrong when the two rolls I ordered came out.  First the "tofu,tofu" roll came to the table. It sounded great in the description : tofu, string beans, avocado, and burdock root dressed with wasabi and unagi sauce. What I got was a roll with just tofu and string beans. I sent it back to be made properly because it looked plain and unappealing as is.  While I waited for the tofu roll to come out, the futomaki roll came out. This is a traditional vegetarian roll so it's one of my stand-bys when I get sushi. I ate the first piece which was the end of the roll. It was covered with rice so I couldn't see the filling, but it didn't really matter because the contents are pretty standard. However, looking at the rest of the rolls, I noticed right away that there was shimp in the roll!   I was infuriated. I showed the mistake to the waitress who was bringing out my re-made tofu roll. We asked for the check at this point because I was too upset to finish my meal.  The owner came up a couple minutes later to apologize or so I thought. Instead of saying, "I am so sorry for this awful mistake. Your meal is on us," (the only acceptable response) he said, "Sometimes we like to change things up." I expressed how upsetting it was to eat meat as a vegetarian, but he just didn't get it. Maybe if I was allergic to shrimp and went into anaphylactic shock at his restaurant, he would place more importance on providing a consistent product, one that at least matches the menu description.

I hesitate to review this place because I've only eaten one dish here: #31, the vegetarian lemongrass beef vermicelli (bun). It's damn good and does a great job satisfying my Vietnamese cravings. Bun is one of my most favorite dishes, but since becoming a vegetarian, my choices were severely limited. I simply can't bring myself to try any other dishes because this one with fake beef is so good.  I'm bummed there are no vegetarian appetizers, however. Most other places offer a tofu spring roll along with the pork ones.  All my omnivores like or love the meat offerings. In fact, my friend that introduced me to Pho Ao Sen drives 25+ miles from Desert Ridge and eats here more often that I do.

Sakana may not be the best sushi in the valley, but I've been coming here for many years because it's absolutely the best value.  Dining in is the way to go with Sakana. They have a very reasonably priced "customer appreciation" menu with over a dozen maki rolls. I always get the one vegetarian roll on the menu called the Jungle Roll. It's tempura veggies and avocado, all for $3.75. That plus some seaweed salad or agedashi tofu, and I'm set. I went recently with my neighbors, and four of us ate off that menu for $38.  Lunch specials are awesome! My husband always gets the Sakana lunch. It varies from location to location, but it usually consists of a california roll (8 pieces), 6 pieces of nigiri, squid salad, and some other goodies. Plus, it comes with soup and salad, all for $10. Two normal people could split it, but my very large, very hungry man gets totally full eating it on his own.  My husband's Japanese bandmates used to turn their noses up at Sakana calling it "too American," but when they saw how much food could be gotten for so little, they changed their tune.

This is a hidden gem in yet another east valley strip mall. I never noticed Spices previously, but then my husband started working at a neighboring store. We like to meet up at Spices for a quick meal together, and it's always a treat that I look forward to.  I am a fiend for stuffed grapes leaves (aka dolmas or dolmades), and the ones at Spices are among my top 3. They aren't on the regular menu, but they are always listed as a special. They are so delicious, nicely sour and acidic, and glazed with olive oil. My husband likes them, and he usually turns his nose up at that dish.  What I'm really in love with is their garden of eden salad. It's tiny cubes of grilled cheese on top of greens with a red pepper dressing. I'll repeat-- GRILLED CHEESE SALAD! It's so flavorful that I barely use any dressing on it. I've also had their falafels and malawach cheese crisp which are good, but it's hard to steer my attention away from that salad.  If you're looking for a meat dish, my husband's favorite is the shish kebabs. He would love to get his hands on their marinade recipe for grilling at home.   The only thing that makes me hesitate giving Spices a 5 start review is the prices. It's not cheap considering the strip mall ambience. If it were a bit more reasonable, my husband would probably eat there every day.

The up-selling here is beyond ridiculous. I came in for a wash last year and ended  up pre-paying for an interior detail and wax. (apparently I didn't have enough coffee and my defenses were down). I brought my car back this week to get the detailing done, and the guy tried to talk me into spending another $170 for extra special wax and headlight cleaning. Both times, the sales guys said they were allowed to discount certain things, but then after saying no a few times, the price comes down. When I told the guy I was tight on time and didn't want to add any services that would increase my wait time, he told me it wouldn't take any longer. Hmm, then that really makes me question the quality of the work.  The detail was just ok. There were areas along the dash that didn't get cleaned very well, and the windows were very streaky. They also took a half hour longer than promised.  I'll be back again to redeem the wash coupon that I got with my detail, but I'll make sure I'm very emphatic about only wanting a wash.

Definitely some of the worst service I have ever had at a restaurant, and we came here on my mom's birthday! I feel terrible for letting this place put a damper on her special day.  Our server wasn't rude. She was scatterbrained and completely incompetent. I have no idea what she's doing in the service industry because she's clearly not cut out for it.  She didn't know the menu or happy hour specials at all. My dad actually had to walk outside with her to point out the advertised beer that he wanted. She spent lots of time at the hostess station doing nothing. Our waters stayed empty. When she checked up on us, we asked about one of the rolls we ordered. She just stared at us dumbfounded, and then presumably went to put it our order. However, the roll never came. When she checked on us again, we repeated the same process. I was getting very annoyed at this point. I went up to her at the hostess station and told her to cancel the order if it wasn't coming out soon. She said the chef was making it, but 10 minutes later, still no sushi. At this point, the hideously uncomfortable chairs were causing all of us to have back spasms. Now I know why people were sitting outside in August without fans or misters. The metal chairs out there were better in comparison.  Finally, I went up to her again at the hostess station and told her to ring me up right then and there so we could leave. She kept saying the roll was almost ready, but I wasn't going to be fooled twice.  Needless to say, this place is on our black list, and we'll be telling as many people as possible to avoid it.

I was so relieved to find Camelback Moving on Yelp after running into a few dead ends with movers that were recommended by friends. I was nervous as this was the first time I had to hire movers, but it turned out to be a great experience.  The two movers were fast, efficient, and professional. I felt so bad for them because it was 102 and 80% humidity that day! They were able to move items out of my old house in Mesa to our new place in Gilbert (a 2 story) plus pick up two pieces of furniture at two other houses in less than four hours.  I deducted one star because there was a glitch in my paperwork (wrong hourly rate) and also due to the piece of stucco near our front door that was damaged during the move. Nothing so big that would prevent me from using them or recommending them again.

My favorite dining option inside Mekong. I love the vegetarian bun. Lots of noodles and lettuce topped with crunchy egg rolls. It comes with a dark, flavorful sauce that substitues for the traditional fish sauce. I would like to see another topping besides eggs rolls like a faux (pho?) meat.   Tofu spring rolls and the accompanying peanut sauce is delicious. I can't specifically comment on any other dishes, but the family that I've brought here all love their dishes.  Service is so friendly and welcoming. UnPhogettable is one of those places where you feel like you're dining in someone's home.

I came here with my mom and sis during the AZ Spa Girls summer spa series. We got a tour and mini spa services during a Friday evening, and the three of us returned a couple weeks later for our spa treatments. I've have been to a few other resort spas in the valley, and Joya has been the best one so far.  The locker room had lots of space and plenty of attendants to make sure the area was kept up. One worker even noticed that my robe had a tear in the sleeve and brought me a new one.  My sister and I started off our day with a pilates class. On the website, it states there would be a $10 fee for the class, but we weren't charged. The class only had four people, and the instructor was definitely top notch.  I went for my facial soon after wards. I've gotten dozens of facials in the last decade, and this was one of the tops. The room and table were very comfortable and kept at the perfect temp. My aesthetician was great. She really knew what my skin needed and didn't hold back on the extractions. There wasn't any attempt to upsell me on any add-on services which I appreciate.  My favorite part of the spa was the pool. Since it's on the second story, you get a killer view of the mountains and palm trees. The pool is only for spa guests so it's quiet and relaxed. The food served poolside was surprisingly good. My mom and sister went gaga over the turkey sliders. I got the veggie flatbread, and it was so big I couldn't even finish it. The menu indicated it had 400 calories, but I don't believe it. If it's true, that's a work of black magic.  We also spent some time in the sauna and hot tub. This area was much larger compared to the other spas I've been too. There's also a shower where you can be quickly deluged with ice cold water, but I prefer sticking with the warmth.  Next time I come back here I will ask them to skip the crystal ceremony. I appreciate New Age stuff, but it's just a little to cheesy for me.

5 stars alone for refusing to serve ranch! Thanks, Grimaldi's, for preventing customers from ruining their fine pizza. Ranch on Papa John's is ok. Ranch on thin, crisp coal fired crust is not.  Grimaldi's really is our favorite pizza in town. It's not as good as Pizzeria Bianco, but Grimaldi's is just a mile and one phone call from being enjoyed in the comfort of my own home. Besides the awesome crust, I love the whole milk mozzarella. The sauce is ok. Toppings are good too. We always ask for a margherita even though it's not on the menu-- it's a quick way to ask for a tomato, basil and garlic pizza.  Although we mostly do take-out, service has been consistently good for the little that we interact with them. If you're on their mailing list, you can get a free large pizza on your birthday.

I stumbled upon this place after picking up my friend at the airport. We needed breakfast, and it had "Eggs" in the name, so I figured it was worth a shot. That was almost four years ago, and now I must eat here every time I come to Vegas (at least twice a year).  The food ranges from pretty good to excellent. They really excel with Mexican dishes. Their enchilada sauce is fantastic. There is a huge selection so I have plenty of veggie options. The carnivores that I've brought here love it too.  Service is friendly, and they get the food out so dang fast. Just what you want in a breakfast joint.  As others have mentioned, the big bonuses of Egg Works are as follows: redonk banana muffins, coffee carafe on the table, and free wi-fi.

My husband and I have been making it a tradition to go Vegas to celebrate our birthdays. For our hotel, we usually go the cheapo route so we can spend more money on gambling and dining. This year, I decided to book the Tropicana because it is now owned by Hilton. I have gold status with them so I knew our breakfast would be comped at least. The $49 room rate was decent too.  I booked a bungalow room thinking it would be nice to have a balcony, but it soon became clear that the AC wasn't functioning properly. I asked to be moved to another room, and the front desk said they would send security over to open up a nearby room. We waited half an hour and no one showed up. So I went to the front desk, and the woman offered to upgrade us to a "mini-suite" in the newer tower. What a joke! It was just a regular room at the end of the hall with a small triangle's worth of extra square footage. Oh well, can't get too uppity about a $49 room, right?  I was hoping things would be better on the casino floor, but it was much worse. My husband and I were sitting at the automated roulette table for 30 minutes and watched 4 cocktail waitresses walk right past us. We cashed out and moved over to the bar to play some video poker. The bartender was nice and helped us promptly, but he clearly had no idea what he was doing behind the bar. I ordered a french martini and my husband got a manhattan. Both were made with the wrong liquors.  The pool area is clean and not too crowded. We didn't enjoy it all that much though because of the god awful music playing (I think a 12 year old girl choose the playlist) and the retina-burning level of chlorine in the pool.  What did save the Tropicana was the great breakfast. The buffet had a decent selection of the usual suspects, and the quality was all average or better. I loved the omlette bar, and the guy working it was awesome. So much fun and very competent. I wasn't his only fan. A group of ladies doing business travel asked to take their picture with him.  We had a fun trip despite our accomodations, but I think next year we'll splurge on a nice hotel.

So here's another place where I had a night and day difference between my first  two visits. My sister and I came here in August for my birthday. It was taco Tuesday so we were able to chow down on some tasty discounted tacos (veg for me, chicken and fish for her). We also had some great cocktails including a delicous spiked melon agua fresca. The only disappointing item on that visit was the the elote which definitely didn't live up to its reputation.  I came here again last Saturday with my husband and neighbors after a play. I was happy we happened to be there just in time for the end of happy hour. This time, I had to try their much-lauded chilaquiles. I was initially disappointed with my first few bites. The veggies didn't really go with the dish, and the sauce was way too tame. Then my disappointment turned to disgust as I realized I was eating chicken! I think the kitchen realized at the last minute they put chicken in my vegetarian dish and tried to get most of it out, but there were some chunks left behind. At the same time, I was drinking a horrible spiked watermelon agua fresca that I also had to send back. At least the blood orange margarita was good.  I am giving GB two stars because my husband loved his tacos, more so than our neighborhood joint, Joyride. I don't think I will return, however.

I had a desire to find a replacement for Massage Envy, but I still haven't found what I'm looking for. Massages are the sweetest thing, and I need a place close by with extended hours to match my schedule. Unfortunately, Elements is not the one.  It was a beautiful day for a massage seeing how I was hunched over the computer at work for two weeks straight since New Year's Day. My therapist, Theresa, gave me a nice massage. Not painful enough that I was asking for mercy, but not wonderful enough to have me shouting "gloria!" I hated the too-warm therapy room and its loud ticking clock. I didn't stay for long; in fact, I made my exit immediately after getting a lame sales pitch about a monthly wellness plan.  While I will walk on by Elements, they have a great location near Sprouts, and I'm sure they will continue to stay in business, with or without you.

What I love about this place is the selection and the prices. They are cheaper than other stores about 90% of the time. I love it when their ads have the $15 off a $100 wine purchase coupons. I have a list organized by aisle so I can quickly navigate the store. Actually, I also love their real-time inventory system that they have online. It's nice to know if something that I see in Wine Spectator is available there.  The service could be better though. Either the workers are nonexistent or chatting amongst themselves, or they won't stop hovering and making unsolicited recommendations. They need to find a happy medium.

I have used Perfect Fit a few times in the past and found them to be expensive but competent. Given their location at San Tan, I was able to look past their high rates since I figured they pay a hefty rent. After my last alteration, however, I will never use them again.  I brought in a beautiful white cocktail dress that needed be taken in in a couple places. They charged me $65 which was much more than I expected, but I agreed to pay since I got the dress cheap at Last Chance.  When I picked up the dress, I tried it on and noticed a black mark towards the bottom on the back. It was a very obvious mark so I know that mark didn't exist when I brought it in. I pointed it out, and the owner started using spot remover to take it out. She asked me to come back the next day so she could have more time with it.  She called me the next afternoon to tell me the dress was still dirty and needed to be taken to the dry cleaners. She said, "The dress is really dusty. It probably was sitting at Last Chance for a long time." I was very annoyed, but I was in a time crunch and didn't feel like arguing. When I picked up the dress, the owner wasn't there. The black mark was gone, but the area around it was pilled from all the rubbing she did with the spot remover. The dry cleaners managed to remove the water stain left from the spot remover, but the pilling is permanent and ruined my dress.

It's ironic that this restaurant is named after a great architectural team because Frank and Albert's suffers a fatal design flaw. The glass-enclosed dining room doesn't have any shades to block out the blinding Arizona sun. This has to be a problem that has been brought to management's attention before. I cannot believe they haven't installed anything to protect their customers' retinas.  We had a bridal shower in that room, and all the people who had the misfortune of facing the windows spent the afternoon with their hands shading their eyes and wearing sunglasses.  Very uncomfortable and unpleasant experience.  As for the food, the bread and french fries are great. I'm a big fan of the chipotle ketchup that's on the table. However, I was really disappointed with the casear salad. The kitchen's interpretation of the classic is to add a shit-ton of celery. Yuck. My tofu entree was good. The green beans with it were really delicious and fresh. Dessert was a disaster. I got soy ice cream which I normally enjoy, but I'm pretty sure the abomination that was served to me had been sitting in the freezer for at least a year.   Two of our servers, Sherri and John, were outstanding. They were so friendly and welcoming.

After seeing raves in my twitter feed over the past two years, I finally got a night off with my hubby to go to FnB. I felt a twinge of anxiety that FnB might not live up to all the hype, but I left the restaurant fat and happy. Halfway through my meal, I was already plotting on what to order and who to bring the next time I come back.  We started off with cocktails. My ginhound (gin, grapefruit, mint) was pitch perfect, and my husband loved his bourbon-based drinks. Had to get the famous leeks. It's all about the mustard bread crumbs for me. The falafel and radishes were a great combo, and not something I would have ever put together.  My husband got lamb shanks for an entree and raved about how well the meat paired with the accomanying veggies including cauliflower which he normally abhors. He also happily picked off brussels sprouts from my veggie plate, another vegetable that he claims to dislike. The grilled asapargus topped with lemon was mouthwatering, but my favorite veggie was the stewed tomatoes and spinach. So damn good!  The atmosphere is wonderful at FnB, and service is outstanding of course. Being from Gilbert, I loved how kid-unfriendly this place is. I had a wonderful date night with my husband, and I'm anxious to repeat the experience again.

I have been to FnB two more times since my initial review. While I still love the unique, veggie-centric dishes, there were a few hiccups from a food and service standpoint that prompted me to update my review.  I took my dad here for his birthday because I knew he would love sitting at the counter in the middle of all the action since he was in the restaurant business as an owner/manager for almost 20 years.  Problem 1- His okra, black eyed pea and bacon dish had to be sent back because the okra was too woody. Very difficult to cut with a fork and knife. The replacement dish was much better. The okra was tender, and the bacon was cooked perfectly (according to my husband).  Problem 2- I ordered a vegetarian plate for my entree as I've done the last two times knowing I would get three portions of veggies chosen by the chef. I was reassured by the server that I wouldn't be getting repeats of any of the dishes that we already ordered as appetizers. That is how it was executed, but my plate was given to another person in our party. It took a awhile to flag down a server to remedy the situation. I tried a bite of the potatoes that were on the plate, and they were pretty bland. Luckily my replacement plate featured 3 great dishes: cold corn salad with basil and peaches, curried eggplant and zucchini, and very fresh green beans in a wonderful tomato sauce.  Problem 3- My sister ordered coffee with dessert, and it came out tepid. Obviously very old coffee. At that point, my dad got a bit annoyed because, as he pointed out, "a restaurant has to at least get the basics right."  My dad did have a great time despite all this so I'm still very happy with FnB. The trick candle on the side of the amazing butterscotch pudding was a hilarious touch.

Ok, I'm updating my review yet again. i'm losing sleep over the fact that I gave my absolute favorite restaurant a 4 star review due to one off night. My husband and I love coming here, and we love bringing friends here to try the awesome food.  Some noteworthy highlights since the last review:  --We attended the vegetarian night here in January. Of course I loved every bite, but what was really cool to me was that the restaurant was completely sold out that evening. That says a lot about Charleen's way with vegetables. Absolute magic!  --We finally got over our fear of AZ wine and tried a bottle of the Dos Cabezas El Campo, included in the  SF Chronicle's top 100 wines of 2012. The Dos Cabezas Syrah that went with veg dinner was great too.  --FnB has moved to Baratin's old digs. I miss sitting at the counter but love the bigger space. Hopefully we'll make it to the Frank Sinatra table one day.

Thanks to frequent appearances on Groupon (plus the 15% cashback bonus from Discover), I've gotten two more cakes from Lisa's, and I've been very happy with them. I got the chocolate rum last month which was crazy delicious. I loved the rum flavor in the custard, and the cake chocolate layers were incredibly moist. Ditto for the strawberry rum I got today. This is the flavor that they were known for back when Cathy's Rum Cake was around. It's the cake we had at my grandmother's 75th birthday nearly 20 years ago, and it tasted just as good as I remembered.   The cake is really some of the best I've had. I bake all the time, and there's no way I could do anything this good. I'm surprised how much I like the custard filling because usually I don't like that sort of thing, but it goes perfectly with the cake and the just-sweet-enough Italian whipped cream frosting.  Just a couple things keep me from giving them a 5th star. It's a bit steep without a coupon or discount. My sister is begging for one of their cakes for her birthday so if there's no Groupon available, I'll stick with the 25%off flavor of the month discount. Lastly, my cake today said "Doris" instead of "Dons" for the two guys named Don I was gave the cake to. I guess I can't get too upset though since we have a great new nickname for our boss.

Based on my first visit, I would have happily given La Condesa a 4 star review. My veggie tacos were delicious, and I loved all the fun salsas. I couldn't get enough of them! Really, the only negative was the cramped quarters.  My second visit, however, was not nearly as good. On the positive side, I got guacamole this time which was studded with dried cranberries and tasted great with the strawberry salsa. I was impressed with the service too because my friend's order came out the same time as mine despite the fact that we ordered separately 10 minutes apart.   The tacos this time were awful. I decided to get the vegan tacos since the description of "no pintos, no rice" lead me to believe that the beans and rice in the veggie tacos weren't really vegetarian friendly. I'm a pretty strict vegetarian so I try to avoid food that's been prepared with meat-based stock. The vegan tacos come with black beans which were absolutely flavorless. I'm not sure these beans encountered even a grain of salt during their preparation. The tacos also had iceburg lettuce in them which tasted dreadful of course.   So now I know I can't have their veggie tacos, and the vegan ones suck. No reason to visit again.

We stopped here before driving home from Vegas. My husband and I had both been wanting to try this place after hearing recommendations from friends.   The wait was rather long for early Monday afternoon, over 30 minutes, but it comes with the territory of eating on the strip. What I wasn't prepared for, however, was the stifling heat in the restaurant. It was uncomfortably hot even during a cold day in February.  Our server was friendly, but he could have been more attentive to filling our coffee mugs. I guess we didn't look haggard or hung over enough.  My husband pointed to the vegetarian hash, and said, "That sounds like you! Sun dried tomatoes and artichokes!" So that's what I ordered, and I was so disappointed when the hash arrived with yucky raw tomatoes. The hash was underwhelming overall. The flavorful potatoes saved the dish. The biscuit on the side was ok.  My husband went for the biscuits and gravy as he always does. I know people talk a lot about the portion size at this place, but that dish is actually normal size. He liked it, but it wasn't as good as the restaurants back home.  I'm still sticking with the Egg and I as my favorite Vegas breakfast spot.

Pandora's jewelry is very expensive and not my cup of tea. However, my mom decided she wanted their charm bracelet so now I find myself in this store a couple times a year. While I resent paying $30-50 for a little silver charm, I'm relieved that I have a great gift option for my impossible-to-shop-for mom. The fact that this Pandora has EXCELLENT customer service is a wonderful added bonus. I'll never bother ordering online because 1. I'm too cheap to pay for shipping and 2. Working with the women at this store is truly pleasurable.  I wanted a snowman charm for my mom's Christmas present this year, but it sold out at that store. First they arranged for a pick up at the Scottsdale store, but it came back into stock at San Tan just a few hours after I left. They called me right away to pick it up. When I returned a few days later, they knew exactly who I was and what I was waiting for even though it was a different salesperson helping me. That demonstrates great communication amongst their staff.  I'll be back on Mother's Day!

Troy, the owner, is a brilliant businessman. Being a pharmacist myself, I am familiar with the quality of his products and his facility. Trust me when I say his sterile compounding areas are more advanced than many hospitals in the Valley.  After spending a day at his old facility when I was still training, I felt comfortable enough to send my mother to Troy so that he could help her with hormone replacement therapy. The docs around town trust him enough to let him dictate what a patient needs; they simply sign off on his recommendations. My mom has had a huge increase in her quality of life since seeing Troy, and I feel the compounded HRT is safer than the Prempro she used to take.  Do not hesitate to consult a compounding pharmacist if you're having health issues that aren't being adequately addressed. Troy is one of the best in the Valley. It's worth the drive to consult with him, and further prescriptions can be mailed to your home.

I first came here with a Groupon like many people. I only did two of the ten sessions I was allotted, but I found the classes to be fun and challenging. When it got too hot to run outside, I came back to Sumits for an even sweatier and butt-kicking workout. I lucked out and signed up during a sale advertised on their facebook page so I got 15% off my package.   The studio is nice and large and is kept very clean by the staff. After seeing how much some people sweat, I know it isn't an easy task! The front desk personnel (often the instructors) are friendly and informative without rushing people. Two types of classes are offered: the 80 min standard class and the 1 hours flow class that often focuses on inversions. I really like the flow classes on Tuesday and Thursday mornings. Since most of the Gilbert moms are busy dropping their kids off at school, the class is pretty small which allows for more personal attention. I've had Amanda as an instructor a couple of times, and she is contagiously positive!   My only beef is the volume of the music at times. I really have a hard time hearing the instructors when they're blasting Top 40 at an ear-shattering volume. That's when I have to rely on my fellow classmates for cues.  Lastly, a couple tips for other first timers lured in by the Groupon: 1. Bring a beach towel to put over your mat so you don't slip. You can also rent the nice thin towels at the studio 2. Wear tight, sweat-wicking clothing. I hate watching people attempting to tuck in their baggy t-shirts while going into downward dog. 3. Don't attempt these classes if you aren't already in good shape and working out regularly. It's very challening and requires lots of exertion. There are other more gentle forms of yoga out there. You need to build up to hot yoga.

Anthropologie is my first choice for shopping when I want to dress like a Mormon Mommy Blogger. I'm not sure how these 22 year old stay at home moms can afford the steep prices, but I'll be damned if this stuff isn't super-feminine and adorable.  Kidding aside, here's my advice for shopping at anthro. Shop the sale area but be aware that their sale prices can still be unreasonable for most people. When I see a belt *reduced* to $100, I kind of want to punch someone. You can find some gems in there though so it's worth taking the time to look. Know that most of the brands that anthro carries tend to vanity size so if you wear a size 14/16/XL, you will still be able to shop here. Sign up for their loyalty card so you can get 15% during your birthday month. That brings me to final bit of advice. Buy the anthro-exclusive AG Stevie jeans! They are the comfiest and most flattering jeans you will ever squeeze into.  Other pluses for anthro: great return policy, electronic receipts, and helpful staff. Maybe it's because this store is in my neighborhood, but I definitely feel more comfortable shopping here than the Scottsdale location.

My husband and I are just a joy to cook for. He's gluten and dairy intolerant, and I'm a vegetarian. Pomegranate Cafe has us both covered with numerous menu choices plus a great dessert case.  I first tried this place with Laura L., and I was delighted with the lumberjack sandwich (tofu and regular cheese) and sweet potato hash . The sandwich was great, and despite the name, it was a reasonable size. I also had a nice latte along with my breakfast. At the time, I paid with a gift certificate so I didn't pay attention to how pricey it was.  I returned for lunch while my car was being tuned up, and I got a massive burrito filled with quinoa and veggies. It came with a lightly dressed salad on the side. I brought home a carrot cupcake for my husband, and he thought it was great. My lunch, latte and dessert was nearly $30.   Perhaps Pomegranate Cafe isn't a great value, but all the food is delicious. It's an excellent choice for those of us with special diets.

Rigatony's is an old standby for our family. We ate the Chandler location all the time when my mom worked in that area, and my husband and I ate at the Mesa location near our old house when we were first married. Now Rigatony's is only located in Tempe in what seems like an old Olive Garden. It's not a place that I would go to voluntarily, but it works really well for family dinners with relatives who have simpler tastes. Anything to avoid going to a chain restaurant!  My mom always gets the baked rigatony with sausage, their signature dish. I've had it with broccoli, but it's not quite the same. The cheese ravioli, however, is a good vegetarian dish (or you could add a meat sauce). It's homemade and had lots of ooey gooey cheese inside in addition to the creamy ricotta. Their marinara is good, and I like the chunks of tomatoes in it. My husband gets their gluten free quinoa pasta and is happy with it. My dad was very happy with the cappellini pescatore. He went through half a loaf of ciabatta to soak up the garlic sauce. The house chianti is a good value because you get a liter carafe which is an extra glass more than a standard bottle. Like the restaurant, the wine isn't a standout, but it does the job just fine.

Years ago, we met up with some friends for a going away party at The Duce, and my husband and I were thoroughly impressed. It was one of the first times we experienced craft cocktails that require a fair amount of labor to create rather than the standard stuff we used to drink in college. The food was good, and the atmosphere was fun. We started recommending The Duce to people based on that one visit.  Since it had been so long (5+ years) from our first visit, we decided to hit up The Duce after a Suns game. The atmosphere was still great especially with the beautiful weather, and it wasn't too crowded. In fact, the bar was missing its bartender. We waited for awhile and was told by another employee that he would return, but we started giving up hope. He finally returned while I placed our food order.  I experience the same delay at the food trailer. A couple people told me the cashier would return. After some time, the cooks finally paged the girl overhead. No apologies for the delay, just like with the bartender. The food did come out quickly, but it was wrong. We ordered plain chips, but the kitchen was out. Of course, the cashier failed to inform me. They told me I could get a refund which normally I wouldn't do for $4, but considering the minuscule portion size (just a bit more than a handful), I waited yet again to get my money back.  The drinks were much worse than what we experienced on our first visit. My husband's old fashioned was more of a cooler because it had soda in it. My brown derby was drab and overly sour.  Next time we're downtown, we'll head over to the Palomar where we can get much better food and drinks for the same price.

I wanted to take my friend from Florida for fry bread so she could have something uniquely Arizona. Lo and behold, a Groupon for Niki's appeared just a couple weeks before her visit.  Our dinner at Niki's ended up being the last of her trip, and it was a great ending. My friend and husband loved their red chile frybreads, and my husband also liked the special of the day, a green chili chicken frybread. My bean and cheese frybread reminded me of the navajo tacos that I ate while skiing at Sunrise. Just as good as the res. I was bummed our server forgot the sour cream and salsa that came with ours, but the Tapatio on the table helped.  My friend decided she had to get dessert, and instead of going with the traditional honey, she got her frybread with coconut caramel and ice cream. Let me tell you, that coconut caramel is amazingly good. The vanilla ice cream wasn't even necessary. I could eat that caramel by the (very sticky) handful.

This place has become a new family favorite. We love that they offer a buffet at dinner. It's a great way to feed a large group of people inexpensively. The gluttons in my family eat themselves into a sickly stupor every single time.  What really makes Indian Oven a great value-- mango lassi, chai, garlic naan, and tandoori chicken are all included with the buffet. Once they brought out seekh kebabs instead, and some of the men in our group nearly shed tears of joy.  Service is excellent. Business has really picked up for them so there are lots of new faces, but they are all trained well. The female owner remarked, "We haven't seen you in awhile." Very nice of her to remember. One of their waiters offered to fix me up a plate with the puffed rice and chutneys that is similar to an Indian snack found on street carts. I've never encountered anything else like that at other Indian restaurants.  Most of the dishes are great although not quite as good as my beloved Royal Taj. But Indian Oven is affordable, delicious and closer to my house so I'll happily keep returning.

Why aren't more people doing this? Alcohol and ice cream belong together!  We have tried 6 different flavors so far, and they range from pretty good to awesome. I thought the Jamaican girl was ok, but my husband loved it. My favorite is the Alabama Slammer with Southern Comfort which is funny because there's no way I can handle drinking SoCo, but I love having the whiskey flavor. Some of the flavors have just a faint taste of alcohol while others are more pronounced. For us, the stronger the better.  I definetely did not detect any texture problems that other reviewers have complained about. The ice cream is very high quality. It's super creamy and delicious even without the alcohol.  I would like to see coffee offerings as well because coffee, liquor, and ice cream are my holy trifecta. But seriously, an affogato with one of Lee's flavors would be amazing.

Thai Chili is a great, reliable neighborhood spot for good Thai food. Their rewards card is exceptional-- a free lunch for every four lunches purchased! Any other place takes 10 purchases for a free meal.  Service is exceptional here too. The waitstaff is fast, nice and competent. The manager is ridiculously friendly. I'm kind of a b so I have hard time understanding how someone could be so pleasant all day long.  I've been here enough to know what to focus on and what to avoid. Thankfully, the pad thai is great here, and I would get it every week if it was calorie-free. You can't go wrong with the curries either. I got the green curry tofu on my last visit, and it was so delicious. The lunch portion is very generous, and I was able to get two meals out of it. The spicy eggplant dish is another winner. I wouldn't get the drunken noodles again though. They weren't that flavorful, and they all stuck together.The sticky rice with mango had a similar problem; it all just globbed together. I've had better versions at other Thai places.  All in all, this is one of your best options in the area if you want delicious food from a locally owned business. Avoid those chain restaurants at Dana Park!

I have dined in, eaten at the bar, and gotten take out from Herb Box, and every single time the food has been awesome. I've tried their veggie wrap, pear flatbread, and sweet potato tacos. The latter were my favorite, and I really wish I could recreate them at home. Reading the reviews about brunch, I am kicking myself that I haven't spent a Sunday morning there yet.  I don't remember anything about our server when we dined in so I guess it wasn't bad, but I was very happy with the service I got at the bar. The bartender was quick and friendly. Just a lovely overall experience.  The decor is nice, and I think the bathrooms are especially noteworthy.

I came here last week to try out the huevos rancheros that my dad and sister claimed to love. I had been to New Mexico Grill once before for an ok bean burrito so I figured the huevos rancheros would be a safe bet.  Much to my dismay, neither the red or green sauce was vegetarian. My only other options were a quesadilla or bean burrito so I went with another burrito. Again, it was ok. I used lots of the thin, red salsa to add some spice. I was very disappointed with their salsa verde though. Normally I prefer it to red, but theirs was so bland.  To my father's dismay, the rice wasn't ready yet so he couldn't sub the potatoes with it like he usually does. I don't blame him since the breakfast potatoes are just disgusting. I'd bet dollars to donuts that the flavorless cubes come straight from a freezer bag. I'm not sure why the rice wasn't ready yet just like I couldn't understand why they didn't have chips out either.   What really angered me about this place is how I was treated when I asked for corn tortillas for my husband's chorizo scramble. My husband is newly gluten intolerant, and he forgot to ask for corn tortillas instead of flour (maybe it would have been helpful if the cashier asked). When I asked for the corn tortillas, the cashier wanted to charge me $2.59 for three small tortillas! It's ridiculous for two reasons: 1. I'm sure they buy them from Food City for $1/dozen like I do. They definitely aren't made in house. 2. Why can't they show a little customer courtesy by happily giving us a substitution? Instead, the manager demanded that I bring him back the unused flour ones before he would replace them. Why? Was he planning on serving them to someone else?  After this terrible treatment, I won't be the least bit sorry if this place goes out of business. They must be having financial troubles if they are cutting this many corners.

We came here late Friday after getting turned away at our beloved FnB. What a great runner up! We got seated right away and started devouring their fantastic warm bread. I got the Persian cocktail because I love all cucumber drinks. I remarked I hadn't had a cocktail that good since being in New York.  For my entree, I asked for a veggie plate mostly because I was too embarrassed to ask for what I really wanted-- a big plate of brussels sprouts. The waiter offered the risotto that comes with another dish as a veg entree so I went with that. The risotto itself was kind of bland, but the earthy mushrooms on top made up for that. My husband loved the scallops and said the grits they came with were the best he's ever had.  We went for the peanut butter dessert which was a decadent combo of chocolate ganache and pb mousse. There was way too much ganache for my taste. It was hard to dig into the dessert, but it still tasted good, especially with the tasty crumble on top.  Two things I loved about CPH: our enthusiastic server and the space. The server was great at the get go, but I wish I would have seen more of him throughout the meal. I am surprised to see people bashing the starkness of the interior. I think it looks sleek and modern but still warm and inviting.  We'll be back whenever we can't get into FnB.

I've only been to 21+ showings, and it really doesn't get much better than a child-free movie experience! I rarely go to regular movies anymore since shows are filled with obnoxious teens or people bringing in infants because they are too cheap to hire a sitter.   The movie selections are great. I haven't seen any of the indie flicks yet, but I loved watching classics like "The Big Lebowski" and "Dazed and Confused" on the big screen. It's also nice not having to watch commercials or asinine previews before the show.  The wine selection is small but solid. During my last visit, we had a bottle of Shebang! which is a great value wine. I'm not a beer drinker, but my sister and brother in law were happy with their taps.  FilmBar has a good selection of candy and great popcorn. Really, it's a better movie watching experience in every way imaginable.

I heard about this place through other Phoenix foodies, and they really delivered! We've only had arepas once before, but I continue to crave them because of this place.  We swung by Viva Las Arepas for a late Saturday lunch. My husband got three arepas: shredded chicken, the reina pepiada and the beef with tomato plus a side of fried plantains. I got the vegetarian arepa and a guava pastry. We loved our arepas. I usually hate plain food, but I would be very happy eating a plain arepa because the masa is so delicious. My husband said the reina pepiada was similar to a chicken salad as the filling was cold. We couldn't get enough of the spicy and cilantro sauces. The fried plantains were pretty good, but the guava pastry was a disappointment. I keep comparing the last two items to what I've had in Miami so I have high expectations.   We always drive when we go to Vegas so the location doesn't bother us. I'm sure we'll be back when we're in town to get these unique dishes.

Normally I stay far away from clubs, but my cousin's maid of honor picked this place for her bachelorette party (former sorority girl- go figure), and my curiosity was piqued. I figured I would get some entertainment as an outside observer.  Wrong! We arrived around 10pm on a Thursday, and there wasn't a single customer inside! This is the Old Town hotspot I have been hearing so much about? There wasn't even any music playing.  The doormen and hostess were all very nice and were understanding when we hightailed it out of there.

Um, Red Velvet Cafe, what the heck happened? I used to wax poetic about the amazing red velvet cake, one that was so much better than any versions I've had back home. I've been to the original location twice, and this mall location once last August. Every time the red velvet cake was a great treat. Vegan! And only 150 calories!   During my last visit this month, the cake tasted totally different. Not terrible, just blah. Nothing that is worth recommending to friends. In fact, now I feel embarrassed that I ever encouraged people to try it.  At least the service continues to be very friendly.

Need some education with your booze? Of course you do!  We had a great time learning from George and hearing the great story of how he went from sailing on the Danube to opening up the first distillery in Nevada. He is charming, smart and entertaining not to mention very hospitable. He actually came in special after the 4th of July conduct our tour.  There was a huge selection of gin, whiskeys, vodkas and moonshines for our tastings. George was happy to let us try them all although we wisely stopped at around 6. We took home some apple pie moonshine (also available at local Costcos), wheat whiskey, 7 grain whiskey and a bottle gin. I am completely in love with their gin. George uses prickly pear as part of his botanical mix, and it gives the gin a lovely flavor.  We hope to come back for the release of the single malt whiskey this winter. Without a doubt, we'll be coming here to stock up any time we come to Vegas.

Frost wasn't on my radar when I saw it appear at San Tan because I thought it would be like all the other chains at the mall. Ice Cream/gelato/froyo places are a dime a dozen around here, and there aren't many that are worth the caloric indulgence. Luckily, a fellow foodie coworker of mine raved about and mentioned a few flavors worth trying.  The gelato here is very good; it's even better than some of the places I've tried in Italy. I tried the pistachio and chocolate hazelnut. Next time I'm going for the coconut or amaretto. My husband got the recommended blackberry cabernet sorbet, and I was very impressed how strongly the wine flavor came through. I hope the Mormons know to avoid that one.  What I don't like about this place is it still does have that chain feel to it. The TV showcases Frost franchise opportunities. They offer way too many flavors for me to feel confident that they can excecute them all well (and really?! bubblegum gelato...gross!). It's not a good value either. They won't let you get two flavors with the small cup. My favorite place in Italy let you get 3, and it was cheaper.  I'll be back to Frost because the flavors are great, and it's so close to my house. I'll just have to become blind to some of the chain qualities they exhibit.

I'm an acai convert! My gym and work are right next to Thrive, but I never considered eating there until I saw some rave reviews from fellow Yelpers. I'm so thankful I tried Thrive out because it's a wonderful work lunch option for me.  Yes, the bowls might seem expensive for $8-10 each, but I stay full for at least 4 hours after eating one. I usually get a medium with one or two extra toppings like cacao nibs or goji berries.  The granola they use is very good, and I love how it pairs with the tart acai base. The chocolate walnut bowl is my favorite, but I plan on trying them all.  Service has been friendly and quick. One young woman was even conscientious enough to follow me outside to make sure my order was correct (it was).   The only thing I haven't been happy with is the use of frozen fruit (e.g. pineapple, cherries). I'd rather those bowls be taken off the menu if the fresh fruit isn't available.  I'd also like it if the nutrition information available at the counter was also posted on the website. I'm sure many people would find that useful.

I love everything about this place. It would be a cool venue in any city, but considering it is the the entertainment wasteland that is Phoenix, the Crescent Ballroom is exceptional.  Most of the shows I've gone to in the past year have been either here or at the Marquee. Talk about opposite ends of the spectrum! Compare the friendly staff to the surly workers at the Marquee. The wonderful temperature control versus the sweltering heat. The clean, plentiful bathrooms instead of cesspool restrooms. And what about the free water stations, great cocktails, stadium seats, and a damn tasty veggie burro big enough for two?  All of these great elements make Crescent Ballroom a shining star in Cen Pho. In a town where venue after venue is shutting down, I couldn't be happier that this place is thriving.

This was our very first stop after driving up from Phoenix, and we arrived hungry! I was driving so I stuck with a delicious thai tea while my husband and friends had sake bombers. We were all pretty happy to start our vacation, and I really enjoyed being in such a unique place.  On to the food-- I got the seared tofu salad which was better than expected. I thought the tofu slices would only be lightly cooked, but they were similar to agedashi tofu which I love. The 28go rice was very good and different. All the seaweed added to the dish gave it a pleasant fishy taste, something I miss since going veg.  The guys started with the grilled ribs which were unanimously loved. Our friends also enjoyed their trinity sliders, but my husband wasn't that happy with his miso ramen. He's a ramen fiend, and he thought the broth tasted a bit off. Being a big, hungry guy though, he finished the entire bowl. The waitress remarked that the chef would be happy someone actually ate all the broth. Maybe that should tell him something....  I have to get mochi whenever it's available, and our friends had never tried it before. I loved the presentation and liked the flavor, but I wished the green tea sauce was thicker so that it would adhere to the roll. Our friends were happy with it so I'm glad I converted a couple more mochi-eaters.

I'm so happy this location exists! I am a die-hard fan of Cartel's black market espresso for my home machine, and it's easy to get my fix here since we find ourselves in old town on a regular basis.  We buy 3 bags at a time since they comp our drinks with the purchase. I always get a toddy to go, and I love the simple syrup pump they have out because I can quickly sweeten my drink.    The staff is pretty nice and polite, no attitudes detected here. One server even took the time to explain different techniques to make iced coffee when I asked about some of their equipment.  The coffee itself is my absolute favorite. It's smooth while still providing a good caffeine kick. It has comletely ruined us. It's not cheap, but I justify the splurge since my morning cappuccinos are what gets me out of bed in the morning.

This is a great place to hit up after a show at Gammage. You can walk down Mill and get a delectable ice cream sandwich big enough for two people to share-- all for $2! By the time you enjoy your tasty treat, the parking lot has cleared out, you can avoid the headache of leaving Gammage at night.  I've been here a couple times now, and I've gotten the double chocolate cookie both times. It's so good, and the texture is just right for an ice cream sandwich. I like the ice cream (got pb cup and cookies and cream), but I wish there was a few more flavors. I also wish there was water cups available for customers, but for $2 I can live with it.

I've tried to resist the lure of Lululemon for the past few years ever since my workout nut friend took me to one in England. Back then, I was way too fat to fit into their clothes. Now that I've become a bit of a gym rat myself, I realized my thin Old Navy crops and stained Under Armour shirts weren't cutting it anymore.  The staff at the Chandler store were helpful in explaining the sizing and fit of their pants and tops. Items are arranged from loosest to tighest fit. They also let me know the store offers free hemming which I need being 5'2". Dressing room staff are always quick at retreiving different colors and sizes as needed.  I am absolutely in love with all the items that I've bought at Lululemon. Of course, you need to LOVE what you buy because it's so expensive. So far I've gotten the cool racerback top, wunder under crops, ta-ta tamer and flow-y sports bras. The wunder unders feel and look amazing. The wide waistband makes them flattering, and it never does that annoying roll-down thing. The material is great at absorbing/wicking sweat and doesn't leave any embarassing marks. The racerback tops are long and stay in place doing yoga, spin, or running.  I would recommend this store to anyone who worksout consistently several days a week. The clothes are an investment as a couple outfits could set you back hundreds of dollars. If you are just starting out, stick with Old Navy and Target.

I am so happy that Connelly Billiards was too busy to move my new pool table. I ended up saving over $100 using a great local business!  The neighbor from whom I bought the pool table had good things to say about Connelly, but they were booked until after 4th of July. I was hesitant calling someone unknown on Craigslist, but the Connelly employee told me to look for anyone who was licensed and bonded.   The owner, Steven, answered right away and was very professional and friendly. He answered my questions, gave me the price, and made an appointment to move the pool table a couple days later.  Steven and his employee arrived at my neighbor's house on time and proceeded to quickly but carefully disassemble the pool table. They worked so hard, despite the heat and two flights of stairs. My husband kept saying, "There's no way I could have done this." and "I'm so glad we hired these guys." Definitely something worth leaving to the experts.  From beginning to end, the whole move took just an hour. Steven gave us some pointers about the care and maintenance and told us a few other things to watch out for. I loved that he uses an iPad for all the paperwork. One last thing to have around the house.   I would recommend this company to anyone!

I finally tried The Spot this afternoon when I had some time to kill before work. It's just across the street from me, and I've been wanting to try it since it opened up last month.  As other reviewers have said, the place is very small and awkwardly arranged. There was only two other people in line while I was there, but I still had to manuever around them to get water from the soda fountain. The two tables downstairs were already occupied by a dad and son in one and an employee in another. Why is an employee taking a table away from a customer? Shouldn't they be provided a break room or at least eat outside?  I got the veggie sandwich, and it was sorta good, sorta bad. The bad part was the soggy hoagie roll that it was served on. It couldn't stand up to the filling, and after a few bites, I had to eat it with a fork. I loved how generous they were with the avocado. That's a big plus for me. The baby portobellos were cooked perfectly, not slimy or underdone, but they could have used more seasoning. The side salad included with the sandwich was bad. It was iceburg lettuce (ew, ew, ew), tomato and cucumber dressed with some sickly sweet vinaigrette.  I'm not sure why customers aren't given the choice of sides (fries or salad), instead it's determined by the sandwich you order.  I was hoping to fit The Spot into my rotation of neighborhood restaurants since it's within walking distance, but it's not good enough to sway me away from The Coffee Shop or Joe's Farm Grill. Not even close.

I was thrilled when I heard Postino was opening in Gilbert having been a regular at the Arcadia location years ago. After a dozen or so visits to Postino East, I can confidently say that my enthusiasm hasn't died down.  Sure the wait times and lack of bathrooms (only 2) are ridiculous, but those are the only big negatives I perceive. Well, that and I find the constant presence of children in a wine bar annoying, but that's really my fault for living in Gilbert.  People rave about the bruschettas, but I want to highlight the gloriousness that is Postino's mixed greens salad. I adore the savory/sweet combo of fried leeks, grapes and gorgonzola. The artichoke spread is another favorite of mine.  $5 glasses of wine before 5pm are a great excuse to day drink. Start off with the Ravenna reisling before moving on to some of the heartier reds. If the Imprint pinot noir is available, go for it! If you have a big group, the $39 price tag for the bottle is actually a decent value considering the quality of wine.  Fingers crossed that I make duchess of this place some day!

If it's possible, my love for Postino has only increased. I decided to throw a baby shower for my friend here, and it turned out beautifully. I never had a problem with my calls being returned, and the managers I spoke to were extremely helpful and friendly.  We had our shower at the front of the restaurant which utilized both indoor and outdoor couches. We had the space for 2 hours plus they let us come in early to decorate.  Pricing is wonderful for a larger party. If you have the party inside the restaurant like we did, regular menu pricing applies. You could have it out on the lawn using the catering menu pricing which is an even better deal .I also love that they don't charge for bringing in a cake. You can order cookies through their sister restaurant Churn which is a great dessert option.  I fed a party of ten 4 bruschetta boards, a cheese board, bottle of wine, and "mass-mosa" (bottle of champagne + OJ carafe) for ~$10 a person plus tip. I pre-ordered some paninis too but ended up cancelling them at the last minute, and our waitress was very nice about it.  Overall, it was a fun, beautiful day, and our baby shower went very smoothly. I would host another party here in a heartbeat.

I'm a huge fan of the original Dottie's in San Francisco. I always suggest it as a top place to dine when I hear from others traveling to SF. When I first saw a sign for Dottie's in Scottsdale a couple months ago, I was sure it was just an imitation. Much to my delight, I found out the real-deal Dottie's opened a 2nd location right in old town.  This location is large and well-laid out, and the patio is a very pleasant place to have breakfast. It seemed so strange to be seated right away instead of waiting outside in the cold for an hour amongst the "charms" of the Tenderloin in SF. What was identical to the SF location was the kind, attentive service and the delicious coffee.  My husband had a hard time choosing from all the meaty dishes on the menu but finally settled on the pulled pork scramble. He liked the way it was spiced with green chiles and didn't drown it in salsa like I would have. I got the black beans cakes, and they were incredible! Being a vegetarian, I've eaten my fair share of black bean burgers. Usually the patties are dense and heavy, but Dottie's black bean cakes manage to be light as air while maintaining a crisp outer crust. The accompanying corn bread was good, but I didn't like as much as their awesome buttermilk dill bread. The breakfast potatoes need a little flavor boost.  The one thing that is really missing from the AZ location is their specials board. The dishes on their always sound so good, and it usually gives us vegetarians a few more savory breakfast options.

This place has been on my bookmarks awhile, and after my visit on Saturday, I left unimpressed.  Service was a bit weird. There was an older woman who served me but never spoke, nor smiled. Instead, another man did the talking for her. I find the "limit 2 samples" signage very unwelcoming. I rarely would try more than 2 anyways, but it just feels unfriendly. And why a premium charge for pistachio?   I tried their pumpkin pie flavor since I'm a fan of all things pumpkin be it sweet or savory, but the gelato wasn't good at all. I then tried the cinnamon roll gelato which was better but definitely not as great as all the Yelp reviews had promised.

Compared to the other Gilbert places that I reviewed thus far, the pizza at Carmine's isn't much better, maybe 3.5 stars, but they get extra points for free delivery. I'm guessing that sometime over the summer, I won't have the will to leave my pool, and pizza delivery from Carmine's will be my best option to soak up alcohol. Carmine's also stands out as the only place that serves great breadsticks (garlic sticks). I would never order a side of carbs to go with my carbs, but the garlic oil slick from their garlic sticks is irresistible.   The oil slick also helps with the downfall of their pizza- a massive ring of crust! We're talking bigger than an Olive Garden breadstick. That's why you should always order their garlic sticks or knots. The excess garlic oil makes a great dipping sauce.  For the margherita, I wasn't that impressed with their toppings. It was too tomatoe-y, not enough basil. The garlic tasted a bit off. Neither my husband or I could tell if it was fresh or jarred. Camine's is great with their other toppings though. I was so impressed with their giant sun dried tomatoes and yummy artichoke hearts. My coworkers were all raving about the meatballs, and based on the menu description (beef, veal, and pork), I can understand why. Another nice feature is the cornmeal on the bottom of the crust. It adds a nice crunch. Cheese and sauce were average.  Tip for the owners: Stay open later! You have a captive audience of hungry hospital workers next door dying for something other than Domino's or grody cafeteria food.

I can't stop thinking about this place. The clothes are just so cute and the staff is just so helpful, but I'm afraid if I keep going back I'll never finish paying off my credit cards.  Madewell, for those unfamiliar, is a deriviative of the J. Crew brand. It's funkier, trendier and more boho than its classic, preppy sister store. Madewell's prices are in line with J. Crew. Since I went on opening day, nothing was on sale, and it was physically painful for me to pay full price for their clother. But I did it! The stuff is just that fabulous and of good quality.  Normally I would balk at paying $20-25 for knits, but I swear their racerback tank was one of the softest things I have ever tried on. Much nicer than the $5 cheapies I usually get at Old Navy or H&M.  The same goes with dresses. Sure I have a few of polyester numbers that I've picked up at JC Penney or the juniors section at Macy's, but the 100% silk dress I got at Madewell is so beautiful. I feel like the quality is very apparent so it's worth the splurge.  What I didn't like was their jewelry. I would say most of their items fall into the "overpriced" category rather than the "worth it for the value" catergory, not unlike accessories at Anthropologie. I'm sure I'll change my mind once Madewell has been around longer, and things start going on sale.

European Wax Center is the Massage Envy of waxing. They are corporate franchises that focus heavily on package plans. Sometimes the receptionists can come off as a little pushy, but the prices really are great. They also have a line of after wax care. I love their exfoliator and ingrown hair serum. Kathryn was at the front desk during my last visit, and she was absolutely lovely.  I have seen a few aestheticians here who have all been pretty good. This time I had Kayla who used a different technique which yielded very little pain. I was very relieved considering I've had waxings done that were right out 40 Year Old Virgin. (and yes, I did scream out Kelly Clarkson). I am very happy with my service and will be requesting the amazing Kayla in the future.

My husband and I are down right in love with this place. Excellent food and the best bar program in town. We are almost glad we don't live close by because we would be at Crudo way more than what is ideal for our bank account and waistlines.  We've been to Crudo a few times, and each visit has been delightful. We really enjoy sitting in the bar area so we can simultaneously gawk at all the bottles and take advantage of the happy hour specials. On our last visit, my husband got two orders of the famous pig ears, and I had the ricotta with honey and walnut sauce at the bar. The ricotta was so creamy, and the walnut sauce was surprisingly savory. It was a great match to the sweet honey and Noble bread. We each had a couple of the classic cocktails which are $7 during happy hour. They were all expertly crafted with balanced flavors. Much like the food.  In the main dining area, we've had some memorable dishes including the popular squid ink risotto. My husband loved his tuna tartare and fish special. He was really in awe with how well the flavors worked together. I got the crespelle (Italian crepe) full of spinach and mushrooms. It was way heartier than I thought it would be given the price and the usual small plate serving size. I could barely touch my specially made veggie plate, but my husband was happy to finish it off. We both agreed the grilled onions (cipollinis?) on my plate were the best onions we've ever had.   Needless to say, we're excited to make a return trip soon.

Let's get the most important piece of information out of the way first- the buttermilk donuts are outstanding! Order those, and you can't go wrong. It's the only donut I've had that can come close to reaching the upper echelon of donutdom, Donut Plant in NYC.  Big props too for being open 24 hours. As an AZ native, I'm astounded by this concept. I'm actually thankful this place wasn't open when I worked across the street at Osco because I would have to mainline Lipitor.  I was happy with the service because the lady behind the counter gave us some good suggestions. The other donuts we had (apple fritter, chocolate glazed, cinnamon crunch) were all solid. Great prices too.  Buttermilk buttermilk buttermilk. Just repeat this and remember it when you walk through the door.

I've been meaning to try this place since it opened, and I finally got around to it this week. Now I'm mad I waited so long!  I have tried many veggie burgers in my life, and I think I may have found "the one." It was so tasty and did a great job staying together. The dressed arugula and pickles on top complimented the burger just so. Usually I find myself drowning veggie burgers in condiments and cheese, but this was great as is. Of course, I had to ask for extra pickles because I'm an unrelenting addict. My husband really liked his gigantic haus brat and loooooved the german potato salad. I also got a small order of fries so I could try out all the condiments kept in the 6-pack cartons on the table. The house made curry ketchup is out of this world good. It was hard to stop stuffing my face. Although this place focuses on beer, the cocktail list is great too. The new fashioned and kentucky mule were delicious and very strong. We like a place that doesn't skimp on the booze!  I look forward to coming back so I can try the pretzels and date cake.

Can I just tell you how sorely Harvey American is needed in Gilbert? A good bar with yummy food that's open until ***2 AM*** SEVEN DAYS A WEEK! Sorry to shout, but I've lived in Gilbert a long time.  We came with our family (a party of 9) early Saturday night, and we got seated right away.  I liked the high booth seating, mostly because I'm pretty short. There's also regular seating around barrels closer to the bar.   Our server Audra really took care of our group. She had a friendly, upbeat attitude, and she sincerely apologized for a couple minor snafus (missing water, late entree). She did an excellent job.   We got pretzel rolls to the table right away and tore right through them. The second batch came out even hotter-- you could see steam when you cut into them. I loved them, but my husband though they could use a bit more salt. Can't argue with that.   I'm not a beer drinker, but my husband is. He was really pleased to see Moose Drool and Guinness on tap. I like that they have happy hour until 7pm all week.  I was hoping to try the black bean burger that my sister had at their soft opening, but sadly, it wasn't on the menu. I instead got the strawberry salad that came with romaine, candied pecans, dried cherries and gorgonzola. It was delicious, and the raspberry dressing was just the right amount of sweet. The side salads were also pretty impressive considering the sad examples I've seen at other places. My sister-in-laws loved the house-made ranch because it reminded them of their mom's dip.  The meat eaters were all pretty happy. My father-in-law thought his pot roast sandwich was just ok, but my brother-in-law was a big fan of his stuffed jalapeno burger. My husband, who normally only likes steaks cooked by himself or my dad, loved his ribeye. He also went on and on about how flavorful the side veggies were. I guess living with a vegetarian is finally starting to rub off on him.  My husband said we are definitely coming back. I hope they add a few more vegetarian options in the mean time.

I love Twirl, and I'm so thankful it's far from where I live because I might become one of those people who thinks froyo is an acceptable meal replacement. In a town full of identical shops, this is the only place that I will get froyo. Anything else is just a waste of calories.  It's always a good time at Twirl. I've been there 4 times, and there has never been more than two other customers there making it a very chill experience. The midcentury modern decor really makes the ambience great.  I started off with the highly-touted caramel soft serve, but the praline and pumpkin pie flavors have really sealed my love of Twirl. Topped off with the killer hot fudge or caramel, it's a dessert worth craving. I'll be making lots of excuses to come back here.

I just had to try this place because I've been driving by it almost daily for the last few months. I came here today with my family, and we left feeling pretty meh.  Let's start with the seating. My parents and I sat along a bench, and it got progressively uncomfortable during breakfast. They really need to add some cushions because the padding on my butt was not enough.  The coffee service really irked me. I asked for cream, and the owner pointed to the little cups of half and half on the table. Those are fine for a gas station but not at a sit down restaurant. Coffee refills should be top priority for a breakfast place. I should be begging you to stop refilling my mug. Instead, we had to plead for a refill and also for water and silverware.  Soon after the owner touted the menu as being all made in-house except the french fries, the waitress came to take our order. I wanted the veggie crepe because it sounded unique and delicious. The waitress said they were out of crepes. How can that be if they're made at the restaurant? What were they out of? Flour, water, sugar, eggs, salt? I don't get it.  I ended up with the florentine benedict which passed the important "poach" test. The yolks were nice and runny. I liked the hollandaise, but the whole dish was marred by an undertoasted english muffin. It still tasted raw. Once I scraped the toppings onto my potatoes, I liked my dish better. My dad got the hash which he liked but wasn't as good as Chompie's version. The toast on the side was clearly homemade, and it was wonderful. My brother in law was happy with his biscuits and gravy, but my mom's veggie omlette was bland.   Nothing remarkable about this place. At least we gave it a shot.

This place just opened up across the street from me, and all I can say (in my best Oprah voice) is "THEY SERVE CARTELLLLLLLLLLLLL!"  That's right, those awesome Cartel beans that I pay through the nose for are being brewed right across the street. I got a cappuccino during their grand opening, and it was perfection. I also got a chance to chat with the owners who are very warm and engaging.   I haven't tried any of their food offerings yet. When I do, I will update my review accordingly.  I encourage everyone in the area to give this local, independent coffee shop a shot.

Any place that opens up their patio just so I can eat with my dogs gets an automatic 5 stars, but the food and service deliver too.  My sister and I tried eat last summer when we were staying downtown. I remember it being a great breakfast with delicious coffee and friendly, hip servers. I suggested eat to my husband during our most recent Vegas trip. We had our dogs so I called to see if they were allowed on the patio. The person on the phone said the patio was closed due to cold weather, but she could accommodate us.  When  we got there, the hostess directed us the the patio doors and a staff member seated us. It was a little chilly, but the wonderful coffee kept us warm while our small dogs snuggled in our laps.  My husband tried the same dish that my sister had loved on my last visit, the shrimp and grits. He loved it too. I tried the huevos montulenos. Previously, I had the eggs bene with avocado subbed for the meat. The hollandaise was excellent, but I wanted to try something new. I really liked the dish except the sweet bananas were a little weird. If they replaced them with plantains, the dish would be a knockout.

I decided to get some take out at India Gate during my lunch break. I was really hoping for a great (or even just good) meal since I love Indian food, and it's so close to my work. Unfortunately, my dish did nothing for me.  Maybe it was my fault for ordering veggie korma since the version at my favorite place, Royal Taj, is sublime. I knew Indian Gate wouldn't be able to outdo them, but the lackluster version that I had tonight really missed the mark. Korma is supposed to be creamy, buttery, and yellow. This was more like a tomato-based veggie stew. I really disliked the presence of zucchini and whole cashews in the dish, but it was edible when paired with the not-so-garlicky garlic naan.  Final price? $14. Way too steep to give it another try.

I was a fan of Federal before, but now that they've started a new late night special on Mondays and Tuesdays, I've fallen head over heels in love! A pizza plus a bottle of wine (or two pitchers of beer) for just $20 after 8pm. Best of all, the deal is available for takeout too. It's really an incredible deal. You're basically paying retail for the wine and getting the pizza for free!  And it's really good pizza. It might even be my favorite, but I can't bring myself to make that kind of statement on the record. The crust is so flavorful and crisp. I'm glad they don't shellac it in oil like they do at LGO, another contender in my favorite pizza category. While Grimaldi's might be my favorite pizza close to home, Federal really has them beat when it comes to toppings. I've had the sweet potato, veggie, potato and date pizzas so far, and I've loved them all.  Is there a way to bottle the wine coolers to go? If I could get a growler full of the watermelon mint variety, my summer would be complete.

My husband and I were on our way home from Vegas, and we decided to stop in Phoenix for lunch. We intended to go to another restaurant, but I stopped when we drove by Gadzooks. I didn't even have this place bookmarked, but I remembered hearing about it in the New Times.  I'm glad we came after the lunch rush because I might have frozen up from all the choices. I went with the spinach/mushroom and potato enchiladas on the corn/flour tortillas and topped them with green sauce, pickled onions and guacamole. I like that they are broiled right in front of you so they're still piping hot at your table. The tangy green sauce was great, and I liked both fillings, especially the sinful potatoes. My husband got three different meat tacos; his favorite was the bison. The tortillas don't really hold up for tacos, though. His started falling apart after a few bites so he ended up eating them as enchiladas.   I'm more than ready to go back and try more of the options.

I am so happy this place opened up next door to my work. I usually try to bring my lunch, but there are plenty of times when circumstances don't allow for that so it's nice to have a place like Zappone's among my options.  After seeing a sign out front and reading their menu online, I ended up getting take out from here 3 times during the first two weeks that they opened.   I first tried the eggplant rollatini which came with foccacia, salad, and spaghetti. It was a ton of food for $12. I am iffy about eggplant, but I loved the grilled the slices in my dish. How can you not when they're wrapped around creamy ricotta and topped with mozzarella? The foccacia was exceptionally good. I liked the salad and spaghetti, but I would have preferred a lot more garlic in the red sauce. I gave my sister the leftovers, and she adore them too.  On my next visit, I got the spinach and artichoke piadinie. I was amazed when I picked it up because I took out an entire pizza box. Not what I was expecting for a mere $7. The piadinie is essentially a salad on top of pizza crust. The veggies were topped with just enough lemon vinaigrette. I was very happy that the leftovers didn't wilt since it made a great lunch the next day.  I also got pizza during their buy one, get one half off special on Wednesday. I have been making my own pizza dough for a couple years now so I can tell you with confidence that Zappone's crust is the freshest I've ever had from a restaurant. I got a margherita that was good but still needed more garlic. The Enzo that I got for my meat eating coworkers was devoured right away. They loved the fennel sausage on top.  I look forward to coming back here soon. I hope they add more vegetarian options (e.g. sandwich, grilled veggie plate) in the months to come.

Is it enough to say that $7.95 for two average chocolate strawberries is absolutely ridiculous? They were supposed to be infused with port, but we didn't taste any. Is that kind of rip off enough to deter you from coming here?  Well I wouldn't be a good Yelper if I left it at that. Nosh is in the same complex where my husband works so I thought it would be a good spot for us to meet up for dinner. He got off early one night so we made it to happy hour.   This is where my disappointment began. Happy hour means $1 off glasses of wine, house cocktails, pizzettes, and bruschetta. Let's stop with this $1 off nonsense (this isn't exclusive to Nosh). If I'm going to happy hour, I'm looking for a good deal. Also, if you're a wine bar, you have to compete with Postino. They set the standard. I've seen other places do the $5 glasses of wine, and Nosh should adopt this too if they want to be successful. Instead, I had a $8 albarino and a $13 red blend. Delicious, yes, but not a good value. Perhaps this is why they were pretty empty on a Friday night.  We started with the olive, burratta and mushroom bruschettas. The olive was good, the mushroom one was cold so I didn't like it, and my husband thought the burratta was tasty, but it fell apart and was hard to eat. The pizzettes were also ok. I loved the figs on mine, but the crust was less impressive.   Then the whole debacle with the strawberries happened. Ugh, time to move on.

This place is such a refreshing change of pace from all the other mediterranean joints that serve the same old falafel, hummus, pita. etc. Hummus Xpress is an exciting new addition to that boring line up.   I've been wanting to try out the restaurant  for awhile after seeing it featured in the New Times, but I rarely find myself in Tempe. I ended up taking my parents there before seeing a show at Gammage. We all left very full and happy.  The owner explained all the menu and all the offerings for the day. I got a falafel plate which was a ton of food. It comes with one veggie side, but the owner threw in a few bites of all of them so I could try them out. The falafel was fantastic, and I fell instantly in love with the spicy carrots. I got the lemon ginger and beet hummuses since those were the most unusual sounding. They were both super good, and more unique than the standard hummus I make at home.  My parents were happy with their meat based dishes. I thought it was interesting that one of the choices was brisket. Unexpected for a mediterranean place, but that's the beauty of Hummus Xpress.

Yes, the biscuits are delicious enough to represent the name of the restaurant, but the overall experience won't bring me back.  Service is pretty bad. It took awhile to get seated on a slow Wednesday morning. Our waiter sat a carafe of coffee on the table so refills weren't an issue. It took longer than it should have for our food to come out considering just two other tables were occupied. When I got my champion pancakes (blueberry and almond whole wheat pancakes), I cut into them and came up with a knife full of raw batter. We had trouble flagging down a server to send them back. When he finally did come to the table, he had the nerve to tell me they weren't raw, it was just the juice from the berries. Bzzt! Wrong answer! I was irritated to begin with, now I was steaming. He reluctantly took the pancakes back to the kitchen. The correctly cooked pancakes were good, but they weren't worth the wait.  My husband is satisfied with their biscuits and gravy dish, probably enough to come back on his own.

My husband and I stopped by before 7am on a weekday so it was blissfully empty. Service was friendly and prompt. We got coffee right away, and it tasted pretty good. We got actual creamer instead of those plastic cups of half and half so extra points for that.  I was pleasantly surprised by my veggie benedict. There were lots of my favorites veggies like artichokes and asparagus under my poached eggs, and the hollandaise had a good tangy flavor. My husband was satisfied with his biscuits and gravy, but we was wishing for more sausage.  Special thanks to the waitress who mistook my long-haired husband for a woman. I love a good belly laugh that early in the morning.

I never imagined giving this place such a low rating after hearing all the buzz from various foodie sources, but here we are.   Service wasn't great although our server was nice enough once he finally came. The water in the glass bottles was nice aesthetically, but it was way to warm to drink. Thank goodness we were on the patio so we could dump it out when a colder bottle came. I'm just surprised no one noticed how warm the first bottle was before serving it. The other big misstep that really irked me was our two entrees came out separately. We were doing the restaurant week menu so it's not like we were eating family style. My poor friend and I had awkwardly stare at my plate while we waited for hers to come out.  The presentation of the food perplexed me a bit. There was too much "assembly" involved with our apps and desserts. We both started with the jicama salad. It was light and lovely, but there were some big pieces of black pepper in there that tickled our throats. My friend said she liked her pork belly entree, but she never complains about anything (unlike yours truly). The chef made a special vegetarian fried rice for my entree. I loved the flavor but the brussels sprouts were very chewy. For dessert, my friend got the banana split which featured ice creams "dots" and a frozen, chocolate covered banana. It was tasty, but she struggled to get through the frozen banana with just a spoon. My tres leches was unlike any tres leches I've ever had before, and I don't mean that in a good way. The cake wasn't very moist, and I didn't like the copious pepitas and raisins topping it. There was a nice cinnamon chocolate mousse on the side, though. I would have enjoyed just eating that.  Bink's and Binkley's has earned enough praise from those in the know that it persuades me to write this off as an off night and give it another chance. The patio area is lovely so I might be back when the temps go back to double digits.

When Davanti Enoteca suddenly closed a couple years ago, I was very disappointed. A couple months ago, word spread that the former chef would be returning to Phoenix to take over EVO. I made it out to EVO the first chance I got, and the feeling of disappointment returned.  While Davanti was a classy space, EVO tries very hard to cater to the typical Scottsdale club set. C'mon, 1 cent Fireball shots?! Not surprisingly, the cocktails were lackluster.    I went to EVO hoping that the foccaccia di recco, a famous dish from Davanti, would be available, but apparently, only people who know the chef are privy to that. I know this for a fact because I saw someone had posted about receiving the dish on another website the exact same night we were there. The evening's disappointments continued. My husband's pork belly was overcooked and the roasted cauliflower wasn't any better than what I can do at home, but the controne poppers were very good. Spicy, deep fried pizza dough is a winner in my book. Sadly, I think this was the highlight of the meal. My husband didn't like his underseasoned steak. My linguine was boring and didn't remind me at all of the cacio e pepe dishes I've had in Italy that it modeled after. My sister and friend said the squid ink chitarra was pretty good, but they didn't like it enough to finish the dish.  We sat out on the patio to enjoy the nice weather, but we also felt overlooked by the waitstaff. I still hear people raving about their great experiences at EVO, but we didn't enjoy our visit nearly as much.

After a Yelp event in the Esplanade, my husband and I made our way back to the parking garage, intending to head to Sportsman's for dinner and wine (yes, we needed more food and booze after a Yelp event. We're pigs). A sign for "50% off bottles of wine" caught our attention, and the owner Jon reeled us in explaining the menu and their emphasis on local products.  We sat out on the patio to enjoy the last decent night before summer started. We chose an Italian red wine to enjoy with our meal. I loved that they offered to ice our bottle after the first pour. This might sound strange to some people, but it shows they know their wine. It was over 80 degrees outside so the wine would have gotten way too warm otherwise.   We decided to split a pizza and pasta. We got the funghi pizza which was a special, and I really liked everything about it. The crust was puffy but not soft and doughy. The toppings had a ton of flavor. The spaghetti alla chittara was also successful in my book, but my husband thought it was just a bit undercooked. He also was hoping for a bigger portion for the price. With the discounted bottle of wine, I still think the total bill was a good value for the high quality food we received.  We are so happy we stumbled upon Solo Trattoria. I know if we lived closer, we would definitely be regulars.

I was so happy I finally got to try this place last week when I met up with a group of friends. I had a great first visit, and now I'm counting the days until a 2nd AZ location opens in downtown Gilbert.  Usually I automatically go for savory breakfast options, but the sweet choices looked so tempting. I finally handed my menu to my 9 month old dining companion, and she pointed to the benedict section. The late harvest benny was delicious, and unlike any other benedict I've ever had. Instead of english muffins, the perfectly poached eggs, goat cheese and swiss chard sat on top of polenta cakes. The cakes were on the smaller side which made them a nice portion size for me. Our group loved the hashbrowns on the side because they were very crisp and had plenty of pepper.   One friend got the pancake flight (blueberry, peanut butter and apple), and another got the OMG french toast. I was hoping to try a bit, but there was barely a morsel left when they were done.   I can't wait to go back although I'll still be torn between the sweet and savory choices. I checked with the company, and their ranchero and green chili sauces are all vegetarian.

I had a feeling Kneader's might be bad since the other Utah-based chains that have come to town haven't been that good (I'm looking at you, Cafe Rio and Cafe Zupas), but Kneader's shows them who's boss of mediocrity!  They have one vegetarian sandwich (not including the grilled cheese), and the veggies are cooked in aus jus!!! Seriously! I'm appalled as a vegetarian, and as someone who enjoys the privilege of the sense of taste, I am disgusted by what I ate. I had my husband try it as well to make sure my taste buds weren't off after abstaining from meat the past few years, but he agreed the aus jus taste was accurate.  My husband's sandwich was also bad. His skimpy reuben had roast beef in it, not pastrami. I just couldn't believe my eyes. The parmesan chips were just regular chips covered in Kraft granulated fakey parmesan that didn't even stick. Very overpriced at $8.50 each. To quote Woody Allen, the food was terrible-- and such small portions!

I never like to review a restaurant that opened just 24 hours ago, but I'll make an exception for Joyride. Upwards Projects has this restaurant thing down pat! I met my husband here at 10pm expecting it still to be busy, but there was tons of seating available both inside and outside underneath lanterns hung on a large tree.  I love the decor and ambience. There is lots of fun decorations and bright colors that work well together without being garish. The big U-shaped bar area is fantastic with cushioned, velvety barstools. We were seated at a table near the bussing, but next time, I think the bar area would be the best place, if only for better service.Our waitress wasn't particularly bad, but she didn't check up on us enough. She walked by a few times with a smile, but never stopped to see if we wanted another drink. We always want another drink! Like we often have to do at Postino next door, we started placing orders with the friendly food runners.  The food and drinks lived up to my expectations and then some. I got a veggie torta filled with squash, mushrooms, corn and avocado. I couldn't taste much of the "white magic" (the lime aioli), but the pickled jalapenos on the side really punched up the flavor. The telera bread was sweet which paired well with the spice and smokiness of the veggies. My husband said his carne asada burrito was ok. I loved the red salsa that came on the side. The complimentary chips are excellent, crispy and substantial. They come with a green salsa that's pretty good and is different than the typical tomatillo-based salsa verde.  I really wanted to try a dessert (and salad, street corn, guacamole, etc), but the torta and two excellent cocktails left no room. I got the almond horchata with frangelico and the Mazatlan Mule. The horchata was basically dessert and went down very easy like the other cocktails. My husband got a blood orange margarita made with the standard Sauza tequila, and it was much better than any margarita I've had in a long time. Like their sister restaurant Windsor, I don't think you can go wrong with the cocktail menu.

Here's the universal truth: all veggie dogs suck. Really, really hard. There are no good ones. Therefore, the toppings and bun of a veggie dog must be really spectacular to make it an enjoyable. Short Leash succeeds at this with all their creative combos and delicious naan. I've tried a few at their truck, but I'll always be partial to the first one I ever tried, the Igby. The spicy barbecue sauce, coleslaw and blue cheese makes my mouth water.  At the restaurant, I was finally able to try the green tomato stack, something I've been seeing on instagram all summer. It definitely lived up to the hype, and I'm sure the bacon I left off takes it over the top. I'm glad they had some Dos Cabezas wine on tap, but it would be great to see their 4 item wine selection expanded.  Sit...Stay is a great option for downtown dining. If they could somehow come up with a tasty, housemade veggie dog, I'd give them a million glittery stars.

"Good" is too weak of a word. These donuts are freaking fantastic. They are absolutely the best donuts in AZ. My favorites are the buttermilk, which comes plain or chocolate-glazed, and the apple fritter. The fritters are just about perfect. Crisp, fried edges with gooey spiced apples inside. The buttermilk is to die for. Sweet, fluffy and so moist. The blueberry one is yummy and the sugar donut is good too. It's actually the least sweet of the bunch.  All this donut goodness will set you back less than $10/dozen. I suggest you stop in to spoil your family or coworkers.

Nook saved my husband and I one evening where we attended a party where neither of us could eat more than tortilla chips due to our dietary restrictions (me-veg, him- no dairy, no gluten).   Nook had been on my bookmarks list for awhile for the gluten free pizza, but my husband wasn't down with eating a cheeseless pizza so he went for the short ribs instead. He absolutely loved them! He raved about them with every bite, and he was equally happy with the sides. My pizza was just ok. It reminded me of pizza that I can make at home, and I was hoping for something with a little more wow.  What was more impressive was the cocktails. Not a long list, but the two we got were both very good. Service was impeccable. Both the manager and our waiter really made us feel welcome and at home. We will definitely be back.

I was so thrilled to see a vegetarian place in the East Valley. I love Pomegranate Cafe in Ahwahtukee so I was hoping Cutting Board Cafe would a nearby alternative. No such luck.  My husband and I tried Cutting Board Cafe for an early lunch. He had the black bean burger. He though the burger was ok, but he liked the tamari tofu english muffin that I got better. I liked my dish, and I was impressed with the heirloom tomatoes and micro greens on top. The avocado and pesto were great toppings.I did think it was a bit salty though, and my body agreed. I was parched for water the rest of the day.  I did take out on my second visit so I could have something healthful to bring to work. I went with the lentil cabbage wrap thinking it would be modeled after the super tasty spicy lentil wrap from Trader Joe's. The wrap has huge and came with chips and salsa. It was $6 which seemed like a good value. I started with the salsa which I found slightly off-putting. It tastes like they use lemon juice instead of lime for the acidity. The wrap itself was awful. The overall flavor was overwhelmingly sour, and the lentils were undercooked. I had four bites and tossed it in the trash. This is extremely rare for me because I hate wasting food.   It was such a disappointing experience that I don't want to risk wasting more food with a return visit.

My trainer of all people told me to try this place. I'm sure he was hoping to steer me towards the salads, but I can't resist a good pizza covered in my favorite veggies. It's also close to my work making it a top choice for lunch breaks.  The ordering process is pretty easy although some members of the general public are a little too slow and indecisive to handle so many options. I love that they have fresh mozzarella in addition to the shredded stuff. I don't need a ton of cheese because my pie already has a ton of flavor from the artichokes, sun dried tomatoes, spinach, kalmata olives and garlic on it. The marinara is a tad on the sweet side for my taste, but it's still great overall.  I have even tried their pookie (an individual size pizza cookie) as part of an email list promotion. It held up well in the to-go packing. The cookie stayed warm and soft, and the ice cream remained unmelted. However, the cookie dough was diabeetus-inducing sweet. I'll stick with just the pizza in the future.

I should be dumbfounded by the rave reviews of this place given the quality of pizza, but there are other very average pizza places in Gilbert that have also garnered 4.5 star ratings.   I suggested Brooklyn V's last Friday when I was watching a movie with my parents. No one felt like driving so our usual go to, Grimaldi's, wasn't going to happen. I checked on Yelp and saw that I could get delivery from a place that I bookmarked over a year ago. Perfect timing!  Unfortunately, the pizza was a big let down. We got the margherita ($29 with tip and tax), and it was so unmemorable. The crust was really bad. Usually, I love crust, but with this one, I was wishing my dogs were around so I give them their "pizza bones." I didn't like the grape tomatoes either. Cheese and sauce were fine. Again, just very average. My dad crisped up my 2nd piece in a frying pan, and that seemed to help.   Lesson learned. Don't be lazy. Drive to Grimaldi's.

My husband and I didn't have high hopes for the food based on the reviews, but we decided to try this place out anyways because we were hoping for some awesome cocktails close to our house. We would have been much better off driving a little further to Joyride instead.  We should have known things would be bad when we arrived to an almost empty dining room 8pm on a Saturday night. It was just us and a guy sitting at the bar. Three staff members sat at a nearby table chatting it up while they were doing some prep work.  Our waitress was sweet and earnest, and she definitely kept this from being a one star review. My paloma cocktail was completely unremarkable, but my husband thought his whiskey cocktail was decent. The food was totally disappointing though. The street corn tasted like it came straight from the can or freezer which likely explains all the accumulated fluid at the bottom of the dish. The jicama and watermelon salad was pretty flavorless. At least it came out quickly. My cucumber and avocado torta didn't have any cucumber and just a few pieces of under-ripe avocado. It also had some tomato, onion and mayo but that was it! I can't believe they didn't put any queso fresco or jalapeno on the torta. Needless to say, I've had much better tortas for half the price ($9). My husband got the $16 steak entree which he thought was way too citrusy. The beans and rice on the side weren't even as good as what we  make at home.  I would be surprised if this place stayed in business much longer. The idea behind the restaurant is good, but the execution is lacking.

I really wish I didn't like this place. It's embarassing to shop here when you're Forever 31. Luckily this location is chock full of stay at home moms who are also desparately trying to cling on to their youth.  No, I kid! I kid! I used to think shopping at Forever 21 was beneath me, but that was back when I was too fat to fit in any of their clothes. Now that I have shopped here a few times, I can see what great, on-trend styles they have at fabulous prices. Sure, the quality isn't that great and their return policy is horrible, but when you can get a garbage bag full of clothes for $100, it doesn't seem so bad.  The amount of inventory at this store is ridiculous. The racks are CRAMMED full of clothes. I go into the store with the mindset that I will only shop in one section. Otherwise, I would get overwhelmed.  My favorite thing about Forever 21 is the accessories. I've gotten some dirt cheap headbands, necklaces, and earrings that are very cute. In fact, it has kind of ruined me. I can't bear the idea of paying $20-40 for a similar item at other stores.

Oh Utah chains, you have managed to disappoint me again. I ordered takeout from blue lemon last night since it is close to work, and it's hard to find vegetarian fare in our cafeteria. Getting takeout is confusing because there is no separate line or register. I went on a busy Friday night so I proceeded to the espresso bar to skip the line.  The girl working was the one who had taken my order. I followed her over to the area where they were expediting food only to find out that my order had never crossed over to the kitchen. She told me it would only take a couple minutes for it to be ready. I explained I was on a break from work, and it needed to be done as quickly as possible.  I waited 10 minutes more for my order. When someone finally handed me a bag, he asked "is this your order?" I asked, "is that the black bean ravioli?" He answered, "I think so." Exasperated, I opened up my to-go box, and he said "Is that right?" I don't understand how he didn't know what the dish was supposed to look like. No one was remotely apologetic about the delay.   The ravioli tasted okay, but they didn't sauté the vegetables properly because it was made so quickly. After a while, all I could taste was raw spinach and onions. It took a lot of breath mints to get the taste out of my mouth.  Poor service and poor food means they won't be getting a second chance from me.

When I saw Ike's had opened up in Mesa, I couldn't believe it. Did my beloved sandwich shop from San Francisco that's always a must-visit actually makes it way to Mesa? Once I verified that this was the real-deal Ike's, I started texting friends and family who share my love of Ike's with the good news.  I must confess that I haven't been to this location yet, but it's only because it's so close to my husband's work so he picks up our order. My guy says this is the best gluten free bread he's ever had. He almost sent back his sandwich the first time he ordered it because he thought they put it on regular bread. He's also a fan of the vegan cheese and dirty sauce since dairy doesn't agree with him either.  Being a vegetarian, Ike's is like heaven to me. Whenever there is more than two veggie options on a menu, I start to seize up with indecision (in the best way possible). Their fake breaded chicken is so good. It reminds me of the patty used in McDonald's spicy chicken sandwich (again, in the best way possible). The vegan bacon isn't as gross as it sounds although the fake fat stripes are silly looking. I added it to the Reading Rainbow, and it was delicious.

The Yelp reviews here are way, WAY off. They have gone through a change in management and name, although the signage on the outside still says Greek Grill.   My husband and I were hoping for some authentic Turkish food since it's impossible to find in the valley. Instead, we got flat-out terrible food. My husband got lamb kafta that was pulled straight from the freezer. I got a vegetarian plate that had an inedible spinach pie. It tasted very old and dried out. The stuffed grape leaves were ok, but even the canned ones from Trader Joe's taste better. The falafel was absolutely the worst falafel that my husband and I have ever tasted. There were no visible spices or onions in the patty. So horribly bland other than the taste of old oil. My husband's Turkish coffee was nothing like we had in Turkey. It wasn't bad, but it was more like chai than the dark tar that is turkish coffee. We usually like to try baklava at Mediterranean restaurants in hopes of finding something close to what we had in Turkey, but we didn't want to risk further disappointment.  The service was friendly though, and that's the only thing keeping me from giving them one star.

I've had several people recommend ChopShop to me in the last year. I've never had reason to visit either location since the Scottsdale place is right next to FnB, and therefore, I've always just gone there instead. I'm never in Tempe, but I do work in Chandler so I was happy to see they opened up their third location just a couple miles away from my office.  I tried the tofu protein bowl on my first visit on Monday, and I was happy with the flavorful curry sauce and roasted veggies. The tofu needed more seasoning, but that's what happens when meat eaters prepare it. I showed the menu to my coworkers, and we ordered from them on Friday. They got the chicken and shrimp bowls with forbidden rice, and they were both surprised about how good they were. I got the kale caesar and devoured it.  I just can't give them five stars due to the service. When my coworker picked up our meals, he stood in the phone order line. The cashier called over her friends in the longer line and let them order in front of him. When he got our order, he asked about the missing coffee and missing bowl. She unpacked everything and made him resign the receipt to prove it had been omitted.  I'm hoping this was just one bad visit because I'd like to come here again.

Our beloved Royal Taj has returned as Nandini! The ownership stayed within the same family so the dishes are blessedly all the same. The interior got a bit of a facelift, and the service is still very warm and friendly.  Get the korma, and you won't be sorry. I have yet to try a place that comes close to their sublime version. They also have the best garlic naan of anywhere I've tried. We are big fans of the saag paneer and their masala dishes. I love the paneer tikka too since it's just grilled cheese on a bed of onions and peppers. It's a nice change of pace from the all the sauce-heavy dishes.  I have only gone for dinner because of my work schedule, but my sister says the buffet is awesome. Fewer choices than other Indian buffets, but the quality of the food is unbeatable.

This is the second location for Nourish. The original location is in Scottsdale, but I've never been interested in going there due to the lackluster reviews and availability of other great restaurants in the area. However, when I found out they were opening across the street from my house, I was much more enthused. My husband was so excited that he can eat everything on the menu since it's all gluten-free and dairy-free. There's also plenty of vegetarian options for me.  My husband stopped by on opening night and got a chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries for himself and a mock tuna salad sandwich with garlic hummus and veggies for me. Both sandwiches were served with gluten free sourdough which looked strangely pale gray but was absolutely delicious. The mock tuna was good enough to satisfy my tuna salad craving, something I've missed since becoming a vegetarian. The hummus was too gritty for my liking, but it definitely had great garlic flavor. I tried not to steal too many of my husband's sweet potato fries. They came with an awesome sweet dipping sauce. He reported that his chicken sandwich was good too.  It may not be the yummiest food nearby, but when it's convenient and fits our dietary needs, I am still confident we will be ordering from Nourish often.

We've been meaning to replace a light fixture in our breakfast nook with a ceiling fan for years, but it's something we just kept putting off. We finally decided to stop sweating while we eat and get an electrician to do the job. I contacted several on Yelp, and Rio was the first to respond and had the lowest price. I really appreciate that they gave me a concrete number since it was a simple job rather  than asking me to call them to set up an estimate. No thanks.  The electrician arrived on time and did the job quickly and competently. We really couldn't ask for anything more. We would recommend them to anyone.

I was really impressed with this place! Initially, I thought the idea of an oatmeal cafe seemed a little silly because, really, is it that hard to mix hot water and oats? But it's so much more than that!  The owner gave me an overview of their offerings, and I went for muesli option since I'm a euro wannabe. She suggested the campfire s'mores mix, and I was so delighted to hear that they use gelatin free marshmallows. It's one of the hardest things to turn down as a vegetarian. I loved the oatmeal so much that I went out to the farmer's market a few days later to buy more mixes for home.   The cafe also has lots of great tea selections. I got the vanilla mate and brewed a second mug at work per the owner's suggestion. There's also muffins, smoothies and pancakes, but what I'm looking forward to the most on my next visit is the veggie burgers.

It's no secret that I'm a big fan of Postino. I started eating at the Arcadia location 12 years ago, and I've been the duchess of Gilbert pretty much since it opened. Even though Postino is part of my weekly routine, I was still excited to check out Annex before a show at Gammage.   As expected of any Upward Projects restaurant, the interior and exterior are impeccable. I really loved sitting outside with a gorgeous view of A mountain. I also like the vibe of this Postino better than Gilbert. Very few children around. On the East side, you'll see infant carriers and strollers well into the night.  I'm happy to see they brought back a Furmint for the summer. Very delicious if you like sweeter whites, and it was only $24 which is just $4 more than happy hour prices. I had a few bites of my friend's Hannah's field salad which was great.  It was a very short and lovely walk through campus to get to Gammage, so I'm sure I'll be making Postino my preshow dinner choice quite often.

My love of Ike's knows no bounds. It is my favorite sandwich place in the country, and I'm so happy we have another location in Arizona. I stopped in the Mill Ave store to get a quick bite before a show at Gammage. I brought my friend who was new to Ike's because I insist on spreading his sandwich gospel.  I decided to get the ASU-exclusive Kate Spade with added avocado. The Sundevil sauce is delicious, kind of a kicky ketchup/BBQ taste. Service was good too.  Our cashier helped my newbie friend navigate the menu with his recommendations.   Pro tip- Ike's makes a great breakfast the next morning if you pop the 2nd half of your sandwich in a toaster oven for 10-15 minutes.

Last August, I found myself needing 5 appliances for both my new home and our place that we were going to rent. I was planning on buying everything at Spencer's in Mesa where I bought a HE washer a few months prior. However, I found this place via google and was impressed with the prices. It was (and always is) important for me to buy local, so I went in to see what kind of deals were available with a big purchase.  The salesman, Brian, really took care of me. He was not high-pressure at all. He also educated me on counter-depth refrigerators (the most expensive of the 5 items). I brought the quote for a Kitchen Aid fridge over to Spencer's and the salesperson first struggled to find the model, then  told me there was no way they could come close to the price. Brian not only gave me a great price on that fridge, but he also happily matched a sales price from Ultimate Electronics that I saw advertised the next day. They also have a great price on the pedestals for washer/dryers, about $80 less than Spencers.  Mesa TV and Appliance also has 12 months no interest financing available. I happily took advantage of the offer. 10 months after my purchase, I have not had any problems.  You really cannot beat the prices and customer service here. Avoid those big-box national retailers like the plague!

My husband and I are familiar with Sacha Levine's cooking from her days at FnB. We were eager to try out her newest venture in central Phoenix. The huge space is really eye-catching, and I can't wait for it to warm up just a bit more so we can dine outside.  We've been twice so far, for brunch and dinner. We came at slower times so we didn't encounter any service issues. Our food came out quickly and piping hot both visits.  For brunch, my husband got the steak, eggs and potatoes which he absolutely loved. The flavorful steak was cooked perfectly, and the potatoe hash thing on the side looked sinful. I thought it was a great value for $20. He wasn't that happy with the cabbage salad however. I liked it ok but thought it could use a little punching up. My falafel burger was good but needed way more dressing and/or pickles. When I had the leftovers at home the next day, I liked it even more with extra toppings. The fries on the side were absolutely divine.   Our dinner visit was with friends. We started with the roasted cauliflower which was decent but below my expectations. Our dining companions loved the ribeye steak and pork tenderloin (from the small plates). Their daughter and I both had pasta dishes, and I was impressed with the homemade pasta. My little shells were dotted with kale and goat cheese and swimming in a squash sauce that wasn't too heavy on the cream.  I was absolutely stuffed and couldn't stomach any desserts. I can't wait to try them out with some coffee on my next visit.

It feels strange to say, but I've had much better Ethiopian food in Kentucky. I guess Louisville is more cosmopolitan than we give credit.  I got the veggie combo, and the review from Brian S. is spot on. Mine was not quite as skimpy as his because I got an additional serving of beets (which I hate). I missed the greens too. When I had the misir wat (red lentils) in Kentucky, the dish was so good that I was looking up recipes for it when I got home. Abyssinia's version was lackluster in flavor although it did have a spicy bite. The only thing that I really liked was a smooth reddish brown puddle. I'm not sure what it was, but it was really tasty. The funny thing is my husband had the same looking puddle on his chicken plate, but he said it tasted differently. He left it untouched. His chicken got eaten up, but he wasn't wowed by it in any way.  The owner served us with a big smile, and that is worth a lot. I wouldn't come back, but I'm glad there was a Yelp deal to prompt us to give it a shot.

I'm serious about my wine, and I'm seriously happy with Hidden Track. They hit all the right notes with me-- unique selections, great pricing and a fun wine club. Plus, I get to shop locally which is always a bonus.  I've been a member of the wine club since September, before I even set foot in the store. Something about getting two bottles a month hand picked by people with tons of passion and experience in the wine business was very appealing to me. It's a hell of a lot better than the employee recommendations at Total Wine.  My love of Hidden Track was solidified by a bottle of Tikves Vranec. I've been trying to track down this wine for a couple years. Recently, Hidden Track and another local wine shop started carrying it. Hidden Track was $8 cheaper!   I always look forward to the next wine club selections and my visits to the store.

Gilbert, meet your best bet for special occasion dining. Although it's a bit more casual than its sister restaurant, Nico's polished style and menu set the tone for an elevated dining experience.  I love the interior because the brick walls make you think you're in an older building with lots of character rather than something that was erected a year ago. The crisp blue and white color scheme really pops too. I just wish they would add padding to the cool looking but very uncomfortable cobalt metal chairs.  Our group of four hit most of the menu sections. We had the snacks for a starter which consisted of thin breadsticks, light, crispy chickpeas and almonds that were sorely missing the rosemary mentioned on the menu. The signature dish, the woodfired octopus, was a hit at the table. My dad said he never imagined he would be eating fork tender octopus. My husband loved the chiles on the dish too. My mom and I got two of the fresh pasta dishes, the penne and spaghetti. The spaghetti was a knockout. Roasted tomatoes, just enough garlic, and parmesean that melted into the dish (I should mention all the food was served very hot which is awesome). My dad polished off his brazino as did my husband with his steak. We were about to throw in the towel, but my dad decided we should try the sticky toffee cake. It was pretty good, especially with the bruleed bananas, but we were dying for a second scoop of coconut gelato since the cake was dry.  One area that could use improvement is service. Our initial server, Penny, was good, but she attended to other tables as the night went out. The other servers were very slow to get out dessert and present the check. I was also annoyed that they kept asking if we wanted our water to be refilled. It's summer in Arizona, and the glass is empty. What do you think? Hopefully that will work itself out in the next few months.
