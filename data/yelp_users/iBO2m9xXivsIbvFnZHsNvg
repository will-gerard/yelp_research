This appears to be the Mothership of Food City stores here in the Phoenix Valley. This place is GIGANTIC! Not only is it huge, but it's very clean, spacious, organized, and brightly lit.   I had lunch there this afternoon, just wanted to try something different. At the deli counter (Tortilleria), I had a chile colorado burrito, and a half pound of shrimp ceviche. Fan-Frickin-Tastic!!!! The burrito was muxch better than some I've had in regular sit-down restaurants. The super friendly lady made the burrito fresh to order, with cheese, sour cream, cilantro, green salsa, and refried beans. And, the ceviche was fresh, authentic, and absolutely delicious.   Why buy jar salsa when you can get authentic and fresh salsas from the deli counter here? Next time you have a shindig, get some stuff from here.  I will definitely be back here for some shopping and lunch. Most excellent.

Worst Mexican food chain ever! The places are clean and nice, but the food is so generic and overpriced its not funny! If you think this is Mexiacn food, you'd be better off dining at Taco Bell and saving some $$! I can't stand this/these places... Been to them in Fresno, San Francisco, and now here in PHX, and they are all the same... BORING FOOD.

How excited can you get about a car wash joint? Well, not very! Yet, this place does a good job for $8.99. They're pretty thorough, includes vacuuming, and it looked like they sprayed some waxey stuff on my Wifey's black, Honda CRV... Looks great! They have a lovely inventory of greeting cards as well.

Had lunch at this location for the first time this week. I had been to the other location in Scottsdale, (Indian School rd.) many times, with mixed, yet overall favorable reviews. While it must be stated that this isn't going to satisfy the Mexican food connoisseur, I found this place to be pretty enjoyable, and a good value to boot! I had a machaca burrito, enchilada style for $7.50, and it was HUGE! Came with the standard rice and beans and small salad. Wifey had an enchilada plate, also the same price, and she couldn't finish half of it! Very colorful place, clean, and great service. Nice place for small groups and families. Pleasantly surprised!

We are restoring a 1962 Shasta Travel Trailer, and I took it here to have the bearings in the axle repacked and sealed, for long excursions, and just because it's so old. Extremely friendly & knowledgeable service people, very trustworthy and thorough. My bearing have an older type seal, and rather than putting the old one back on they searched around town for the new, old style, to do the job correctly. Seems they work on anything as well, from giant, 300-thousand dollar motorhomes to travel trailers, campers, pop-ups, etc.

My Wife and I had dinner there, very colorful place at first, seemed like it'd be good. They model themselves after a real Mexico City restaurant, and I'm not sure what that's all about! Food was bland and boring, and I didn't find it to be authentic at all. Service was OK, it was very crowded, but that didn't hinder the waitress. Won't be going back.

My first trip to a Cousins. Very nice. Super crowded lunch spot, but the order to pick up time was really fast. Had a roast beef and cheese sandwich, was pretty tasty. Remember- Friends don't let friends eat Subway! I'd go here again. Delish.

In the past I had tried another place to have some parts re-chromed. 6 weeks later, they hadn't even started the job, so I was willing to try Papago because of my horrible experience with the other spot. This was slightly better, but not by far. I am starting to realize that this type of business plays by it's own rules... Deadline is an unknown word, and on time is a foreign concept. Work was supposed to due on the 20th, and on the 2nd of the next month, I picked up the item the day they called and said it was ready. To boot, the item looked really crappy. The front office was filthy, like it hadn't been cleaned in... OK... Looked like it had never been cleaned. Ever. So, if anyone knows a place for re-chroming, that is reliable, on time, and does a good job, let me know. I'm not holding my breathe!

As far as airports go, this one is really easy to get in and out of. Either way: Picking people up, or taking off for fun and adventure, this place is pretty convenient. No complaints here! Nothing even remotely close to the nightmares such as LAX or San Francisco Intl. This place is a piece of cake. Not sure if other airports have these cell phone lots, but this is a new con convenient deal. You park in a special lot with a giant sign that reports when all flights are either in the air or have arrived. You hang out and wait for your friends and family to arrive, THEN you start cruising the pickup area looking for your passengers.

Not sure what it is, but I love this place! It's not so much the cheesey Hollywood themed dealio, but every time I have gone here I've had a good experience. That counts for something when you are talking about night spots. Mostly original, local bands play here, on a medium sized stage. Nothing special as far as service, bar, etc. Check to see who's playing before arriving- You may not like the genre/type of music. Overall, very cool place!

Why is it so difficult to find a decent salad bar here in PHX? This place doesn't cut it- Its overpriced, and the food besides the salad is mediocre at best. Besides that, the salad items are very generic, nothing stands out as being original, unique or different. Skip it.

Growing up in Pasadena, California, it was always a treat to make the trip to Hollywood to visit "THE" Guitar Center, spend the afternoon there, and really see a lot of cool stuff and cool people. Well, now I'm old, married, I live in Scottsdale, and there's NOTHING cool about this place! I'll stop in if I desperately need something for a gig or rehearsal, but I'd rather avoid the place than go in and browse. That's a sad thing to say about GC... I used to work at the store in Covina, and I always loved going to any GC to check things out. Not so much anymore. Now, I buy nearly all my stuff on line, because even with shipping charges, I get it cheaper.

I am finding that I like this place a hell of a lot more than The Depot! This particular Lowe's is clean, organized, the staff is helpful and friendly, all the things you'd want in a home improvement/hardware joint.

I had been going here for about 7 years now, and only now have decided to review the place. I have 2 reasons for the 2-star review: Price, and service. Wife and I had breakfast, and the bill came to about 38 bucks. C'Mon Man! Really? For what? Wasn't like it was steak and eggs, anything mega-fancy, etc. And, we asked for re-fills on the ice teas, and actually had to get up, go to the drink station ourselves and grab our own re-fills after waiting ten minutes. Then, after breakfast, my Wife wanted to get a few bakery items, and it was like pulling teeth to try and get someone to help us... When they weren't even that busy. Bottom line is that I don't mind spending money when you get what you pay for, but overpriced, mediocre food, combined with BAD service, makes me think I shall not be returning here any time in the near future.

Love this place for strange reasons I guess... I love their cole slaw, fries, and burgers! Its sort of a swanky joint, and you wouldn't think the items I mentioned would be that great... But, they are! Classy atmosphere, other fare is pretty good as well. Good place to hang and have a drink too, especially if you have to wait for a table.

No frills, no nonsense alterations here! Needed a pair of pants hemmed, just 10 bucks! My Wife's hem came loose on a pair of slacks, 4 bucks! Ample parking, on southeast corner of Shea & Scottsdale roads, in the Fresh & Easy center.

Extremely solid contender in the Mexican food market place! Lived here for 12 years, passed this place many times, and just tried it out yesterday. Cheese dip was really great, as well as both of our entrees. Service was nearly perfect as well. Place is really colorful and well kept on the inside. It's slightly overpriced, but maybe that's why reviews are consistent over the years... You get what you pay for in life. Will be going back.

Not a huge fan of this chain but this particular location has a lot going for it! First, the service is always very good- they are extra friendly here. Second, we visit for lunch, and my Wife works at Chase bank nearby, so we are always sort of in a hurry. They are really cool about processing the check during the meal so we don't have to wait for it until we are finished. Clean, friendly, lots of parking, fast, friendly, good stuff!

My second time coming here in a 2 year period. First time was right after knee surgery, and things went OK. No complaints. Second time around, I was checked in and "evaluated" by an intern, which also occurred the first go around. My assigned Therapist wasn't even in the building upon check-in, which seemed to be rather important. My real beef is this... I have a window from 8-1 in which I can attend PT, 5 days a week. They kept coming up with odd times, either 7 in the AM, or super late afternoon, which I couldn't do. It really seemed to me that I was being ignored and overlooked. Plus, the dude who runs/owns the place made it a point to visit people being attended to, say hello, see how things were going, but for some reason even went so far as to avoid eye contact with me. Guess I'm just a worthless trouble maker or something to that effect. I found a better spot that is much friendlier, can accomodate my schedule, where there's no run around or excuses. I would never go back here.

I have mixed feelings about this place. Bottom line- If I didn't have a $25 gift card, I would have been very disappointed for paying 50 dollars for an "Olive Garden" meal I could have gotten for 25 bucks. Food was OK/good, Wife had eggplant Parm, while I did the Fettucine Alfredo with chicken. Had Calamari as an AP, (OK), and Caprese Salad, also just OK.  I don't think I'll go back, as I am a cheap bastard, and if I wanted to splurge, there are much better Italian joints in N. Scottsdale that I like more, that I am willing to fork out 20 bucks a meal for.

We used to be fans of this place, but we noticed that around 11/2008 they changed their prices and their menu, and we haven't been back since. They do have the best green corn tamale in PHX, but I used to get their nachos, and now they are less than half the serving and about the same price. I know the economy sucks, but they are a tad too expensive for what they serve now.   Not a fan any more!

I was looking for a middle eastern eatery so I found the other reviews to be helpful, & tried the place out. Yes, the owner is friendly, and the food was good, but here's what they didn't tell me...   This place isn't really a restaurant, its more like a fast food joint with tables. Sorry, I'm an adult- I don't do Styrofoam plates with plastic utensils. For dinner, we were the only people in the place. Wifey had a chicken plate, and I had 3 side dishes, all good, with diet Pepsi. Bill came to THIRTY-FRICKIN'-DOLLARS!!!!!!!!@#$%%#$@!&*^!!! For that kind of dough, I would have much preferred to go somewhere else.I'm not a cheap bastard, but I do expect to get what I pay for, like ceramic plates and metal silverware. I am still in search of a decent middle eastern RESTAURANT!

I've lived in the Phoenix area for about 13 years, and never been to one of these places. Seen and heard the ads, passed them 100's of times, but for some inexplicable reason, I've never dined at the Whataburger.   I think I've been missing out. The burger I had there this afternoon was totally excellent... Dude. I had the double Whataburger with cheese, and it was outstanding. Fabulous. Marvelous. Very meaty and tasty. There was a healthy dose of garden on it as well: Lettuce, onions, tomato, and some mustard as well. I noticed that their menu was also very reasonably priced.   No 5 stars because the fries were simply Mehhhhh. OK, but not great.  I think I like this place much, much better than some of thew newer joints that I've tried: 5 Guys, Smash Burger, etc. I'll be back.

Over the last few weeks, I have been to this ACE Hardware store about 20 times, as I am restoring a 1970's boat. They have everything that Home Depot and Lowes doesn't have... A lot of odd nuts and bolts, stainless steel stuff that you can't find anywhere else. Very friendly staff, right off the 101 Fwy., they have been really helpful and they have "the goods!"

Been here twice now, and while it's in a good location for us, there's nothing special about this place. In fact, there's nothing really "good" about this place. The burgers and fries were super greasey, service was close to horrible, and the prices were on the high side for food and drinks. In addition to this, I know people that work at the Chase Bank in the same center, and they tell me cops love to pull over exiting patrons and many arrests have been made for DUI. (And might I add, it's never a good idea to drink and drive, and especially when you NOW know it's a place that's a target for DUI). Next time an untelevised game is on that I've got to see, I'll head elsewhere.

What can I say... I am a bargain shopper! I'm not cheap, but I get more satisfaction out of getting a bargain than I do spending a ton of money for a name brand item at Nordstrom or Sax Fifth. That being said, sure you can find a pair of shoes you'll like here, but the selection is simply OK, and its usually full retail price. Most of the time they have a two-for-one deal or get the second pair half price. Still, its never really any kind of sweet deal.

Fresh fast food, but a tad on the expensive side for what it is. I much prefer this place to Baja Fresh or Chipotle- Home of the ten dollar burrito! They have a great little salsa bar where you load your own plastic containers of a variety of salsas. If you've never had a fish taco and you think it sounds yucky, try one here and you'll change your mind!

When I used to live on Thomas rd & 56th st. I used to make the trip up here to this Walmart because its so damn nice! Its clean, well stocked, very large and spacious, open 24 hours, and prices are great. Without sounding sexist or like a male chauvinist, the "People Watching" is pretty special here as well! I'm not too keen on their produce here, but everything else exceeds expectations. Parking can be a mess, there's plenty of spots, but you may have to find a space far from an entrance. Good place to get some exercise in as well because the joint is so huge!

Had the thick crust Sicilian pepperoni 3/14/2009, took it to the drive in movies, and while it was expensive (23 bucks), it was worth it! This baby could feed 6 people, and it was pretty good as well. I wouldn't get this on a regular basis because of the price and the calories, but I think its the best pizza they have.

Very high gas prices at this convenient location. Clean, nice place, but I'm giving it only 2 stars for the gas prices. You can get Tonto passes for camping here, about the only place in the area where you can (Besides Big 5 on Northsight). Arco down the street has the best gas prices around this area.

Switched insurance, had to change eye Dr.'s & found this place very close to my home. The appointment took a long time, an hour and a half, but I was surprised at how much attention to detail they paid, and was more than happy with the time spent there. Rare indeed, a place where they take their position very seriously, listen to all concerns, dissect any problems, come up with solutions, and actually, truly, seem to care!

After a year of visiting this Sam's I'm giving it 4 stars because I like it MUCH BETTER than Costco around the corner (15255 North Hayden Road, Scottsdale). Why is this? Well, first off let's say that I buy only certain items here, as I don't do my regular "grocery" shopping at this joint. Ready made bags of salad, about 3 bucks. Land O' Lakes sharp cheddar cheese, 2 lbs., about 5-6 bucks. Get the idea? Great for parties and entertaining as well. Great place to stock up on BBQ sauce, coffee, tortilla chips, A-1, charcoal for smoking and grilling, and a few other items. Big plus for me vs. Costco, it's rarely crowded, and I can run in grab 2-3 items, and be out in less than 10 minutes. Try that at Costco!

I went to this place once and the owner tried to sell me a large box, for shipping a guitar, for 30 dollars! My Wife has been in there before, and the Dude is really surly, terse & laconic. He has hired some youngsters who seem friendly and helpful- Had to pick up a fax from an insurance agent there recently- But, I wouldn't go out of my way to do any business there!

My first experience here wasn't so pleasant. However, time has changed things, I now have a mail box here, and I receive nothing but friendly, helpful, and prompt service. I send and receieve a lot of packages for my business, and I receive both emails and text messages when my packages arrive. It's really lame having packages left on your front door, not only because of potential theft, but Desert (summer) heat as well. This place is the perfect solutiion for me. They also have other (printing) services & other things going on as well.

Great service and great prices....IF you sign up for their "club."  Club members receive a blue bag with your name on it, you then get 40% off regular prices, and you just load the bag and drop it off! Very convenient. Drive up drop off as well, can't beat it!

Wifey and I dined here in Nov., 2008, and we found this joint to be very overpriced and very average. The place was dead on a weeknight, a bad sign. The room looked like it could hold 300 people, and there were only about 7 of us total. Service was good, but chips and salsa was mediocre, food (nachos and enchiladas) was average, even below average. We found it to be more expensive than other, similar Mexican restaurants in the area. I would not go here again.

Brought my Wife's Honda CRV here after getting a flat on a dirt road while camping up near The Rim. Asked how much the patch job would be and they said" Its no charge, just bring your car in when you need new tires." So, I did! We did some research and decided on Yokohamas, but the sales guys talked us in to the Pirelli's. They ran so smooth and are going strong after a good 25,000 miles. warranties are great here, excellent customer service, and all the sales people are friendly & courteous.

Yes, its a step above fast food, but you pay for what you get. A few months ago I had one of their dinner plates and a drink, maybe an extra taco, and it was 11-something! For a few bucks more I coulda' gone to a sit-down joint and had REAL Mexican food! The food is pretty fresh and all that, but its rather bland and boring. I do like the salsa bar, load your own and take it to go thingy. They also have nice take out cups!

Home of the ten dollar burrito? Well, it seems this way! The place is clean, fast, and there's outside seating, but when you add guacamole, sour cream, and chips and salsa to your item, the words you'll hear at the cash register will be, "That'll be Eleven-Fifty-Seven Sir!" I think this place is a ripoff, but their food is good. Rice does not belong in a burrito, so be sure and tell them that, especially so you get more meat & cheese.

YEAH! When you have some serious munchies, this is a great place to overindulge! Ahhh YES... The MONSTER BURGER! Tackle that sucker and you're a champion in my book! The "Onion Ring Tree" is a novel idea as well, albeit a tad expensive for what it is. Dig the groovy flavored ice teas as well, free refills. Yummy! Side of ranch, extra ketchup... Let's Rock & Roll!

Every great once in a while I'll have a craving for a triple burger from Wendy's. This hasn't resulted in a heart attack yet, so I'll try and keep this craving to once or twice a year. But, I have to say, this is the best fast food burger out there, and although I wouldn't want you to make a habit of eating like this, I do recommend it... Once or twice a year!

Went here for the first time with friends/tourists for spring training baseball last week. I am giving this place 4 stars for the family atmosphere, staff was great without about 12 people, beer selection was good, and food was better than average. Friendly, family place, and we could even park in their tiny lot next door in downtown S'Dale! I'd go back.

Wifey and I have been dining here for 4 years now, and we really like it. Its too spicy for some, and we have tried nearly everything on their menu, with only one or two disappointments. Price is right, the salsa and chips are great, decor is funky and colorful, service is just OK sometimes. Best stuff on the menu- White sands Chimichanga is great! The Fundido cheese appetizer is fantastic as well. Chili Colorado is spicy and one of my favorites, as well as the Grande Nachos. Breakfast on weekends only is a killer bargain, and the New Mexican eggs benedict is a winner! Very, very cheap as well. I am not sure why this place has received such mediocre reviews, as its not generic & boring Mexican food such as Macayo's, Garduno's, Manuel's, or Garcias!

I know you'll come here for the beer, but I have been to this joint twice with Wifey, and the food is REALLY good! We've had salads, wings, a burger, and appetizers, all items have been very tasty and fresh. If you happen to be up near Pima, Frank Lloyd Wright, and N. Scottsdale, give this place a try for lunch or dinner!

Ever see that film by Morgan Spurlock about McDonald's called "Super-Size Me?" I didn't eat at McDonald's for at least two years after being grossed out by that movie! That being said, my Wife and I were super tired, heading out for a camping weekend at night, and we needed something to eat. Along Shea Blvd there in Fountain Hills, there's Wendy's, which I have given up on (expensive, small, and crappy); Taco Bell (NEVER); Arby's (weird, fake roast beef); Subway (genera-sandwich); & a few others. Long and the short of it is this... This food was just plain lousy, tasteless, grotesque, cold, and supremely awful! Had some chicken-part nuggets dipped in sugar sauces of your choice, an "Angus" burger, and the fries were cold, gritty, and tasteless. I really can't understand how and why people eat "food" at these places? Besides the totally disgusting food, the bill was like 18 bucks for the two of us, there were flies all over, and people were smoking just outside the entrance. I was grossed out for the rest of the evening- So much so, we postponed the camping trip and left the next morning because we were both a little upset to our stomachs. Think I'm exaggerating? Go eat there yourself.

This is a cool little spot, especially for out-of-towners. Has sort of a Western theme to it, old fashioned decor, wood flors, etc. But, the food is really good here. Had a (regular) hamburger last time, and it was very tastey. Good service, clean place, lovely place to stop for a bite. gets crowded on the weekends, can be a half hour wait or so. Pies are expensive, but very good. You get what you pay for in life!

OMG!!!! If I could give this place a negative 12 stars, I would!I took some parts in to be re-chromed. After 4 trips over there, a long way from my house, and a complete run-around, they still hadn't finished the work on my parts and it had been over two months! Who gives a crap how good or bad their work is, when it takes that long, or longer, to get them to finish your stuff! Complete waste of time, and I finally went over and demanded they return my items on the spot, which they did. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!

Let me start off by saying this... Any established marine, boat repair joint that has a lot, warehouse or shop, a multitude of employees, and parts on hand that requires inventory, has to make a certain amount of money to stay in business, pay their rent, and make payroll to their employees. That being said, I haven't found, nor heard of a reputable boat/marine repair joint that doesn't over charge. OK... That being said, I have taken my boat (s) here twice now for some extensive work, and both times the estimate came out to be over twice the amount I was quoted. Yeah- They seem to to do very good work. But, if a plumber came over and told me it was 200 bucks to put in a new sink, and then finished and said it was going to be 600 dollars, I'd be frickin' outraged! This is the way it is with these places, and this is how it's been BOTH times I have taken my watercraft to this establishment. Won't be returning.

Haradtailz is a biker bar, but normal people such as myself are very welcome here! Its a pretty big place with a patio for smokers outside. Its not all that chic or spiffy on the inside, but I give it 4 stars for the live music they have in this section of town. Every time I've been, which is only about 7 times, they have had quality cover bands- No stinkers! There's a dance floor-area, plenty of space, and if you are being bombarded from the loud music you can go to the other side of the room which is behind the bar for refuge. Great place to enjoy some live hard rockin' music!

Passed this strip mall place a thousand times, finally tried t out. Much better than I expected... Food was original, very well prepared, and extremely delicious. I had a pork adobada thingy (spelling???), and my Wife had a southwestern chicken pasta bowl that was really great! Service was outstanding, replenished our chips and salsa numerous times. No 4 star rating for the lack of ambience- Sort of a sports bar mentality, not a date place or fine dining room. Great place, otherwise!

If you are into bargain shopping, this is a spot you won't want to miss! I used to shop at this store in Las Vegas when I lived there a number of years ago. A few weeks ago discovered this store in Mesa when I was down there buying a water ski off Craigs List. While the store itself is kind of grungy, and slightly "dirty," they have some fantastic deals on clothing and some home ware items. I picked up T-shirts to screen print for my band, and they were $3.00 each! I also grabbed a few Hawaiian, button down shirts for about 6 bucks each! Yeah, its a run down store, but its full of super bargains!

A bargain shoppers delight! While this is far from the luxury of, say, Whole Foods, in life, you get what you pay for. And, this place is less than dirt cheap. While it's quite a ways away from our home in N. Scottsdale, once a month or so we make the pilgrimage down south to fill a cart of fruits and vegetables, for, like, oh... 12 bucks! Yes- An entire cart full of stuff for around 12 bucks. No kidding. Careful of what you pick, as everything seems to be in ripe form.

I'm a frequent flier with Big Lots, but this store is neither special nor is it nice... Nor is it particularly clean! I just happened to be in the area, thought I'd give it a whirl... Better off checking out the store on McKellips & Scottsdale rd., or Thomas and 32nd st.

This place was recommended by our seamstress guy... Had to get some foam for our dinette benches and back bed of a camper we are restoring. Best prices in town on foam, and the service was excellent, sales Gal was very knowledgeable and extremely helpful. Decided to get marine vinyl somewhere else for much cheaper (Jo Ann's, with 40% off coupon), but other than that, great place!

My Wife insisted we try this place because she's really into hot wings. Gotta' tell you.... very, very mediocre. Extremely average. It was a nice atmosphere- It was the last day of the regular hockey season with some important (playoff implication) games going on. Service was really good too... But, Food was really lacking and it was barely OK. To top that, I can't stand when my food is served in a plastic basket! If I'm paying Nine Bucks for a hamburger, at least give me a frickin' PLATE!!!!! Way overpriced  as well.

I had my first date with my Wife here about 4 years ago (2005), and I really like this place! Great Scottsdale atmosphere- Not snooty or pretentious, just classy enough! Nice quiet bar for drinks, and really good food.

Dr. Dicke has been my primary physician for over 8 years now. Great guy, great practice. The office has enough staff that is he isn't in, another Dr. will see me, and that's a hug bonus to a one-man operation!

I find this place very unique and fun! Its a great place to take out of towners... Its colorful, has very unique and quality food, and you have to love a place that has a "Big Ass Burger" on its menu! Its a lively joint, far from romantic, if that's what you're looking for. Not the greatest location, as its almost hard to find if you've never been there before, as its in an office-like complex. But, those minor items aside, I really dig this place and the food is more than outstandng!

I used to have an Isuzu Trooper, and it gave me a few problems. A friend I worked with suggested I take it here, and I had on several occasions. I found their staff to be pretty fair, professional, and priced right... Not inexpensive or a bargain, but priced just right. They finished work on time, and I never had to take the car back to be re-fixed. I now have a Toyota Prius, so its been years since I've visited Whitey's! Let's keep it that way!

I had a very large guitar case (Jackson Flying V) in which the handle had broken off. I had estimates from other places for 50 bucks and even more to put a new one on. REALLY??? This joint hooked me up for 25, and I also had a nice pair of Cole Hahn sandals fixed for same price... 50 bucks, great work, done in a timely manner, friendly & courteous service. What else could you ask for?

OK... A review for an X Ray place. Your Dr. says, "You need an X Ray." Place is located in same center as your Dr., so you say, "OK... I'll take the elevator down and get it done." Well, it's as simple as that. At 50 years of age, I'd had a few X Rays in my day (unfortunately). And this place was cool- Staff was professional enough, it was clean, the wait was very short, etc. etc. Technician was a Raiders fan, so added bonus for me! If the last X Ray spot you went to pissed you off, or you thought it sucked, maybe try this one (???). Worked for me.

Smaller store, but friendly, helpful service, and some good deals as well! I bought my Boss tuner here and it was cheaper than Guitar Center! They have a different selection of guitars than most joints, so its worth it stop on in every once in a whiole to check it out. Strange location in a 70's-like outdoor mall, but its kind of funky-cool in a way!

Not as bad as Chevy's, but this generic chain is just OK as far as food and atmoshpere. Bland and boring, OK for drinks and meeting people after work, but I would not go out of my way to eat here.

Really good neighborhood joint! We've been ordering here for about 4 years, and its pretty consistent and good. Prices are ok, not a bargain, but just fair. Pizza is above average, sandwiches are great (roast beef), Wifey love's their french fries, and the homemade italian dinners (like lasagna, eggplant parmesian, etc.), are really good as well. Deilvery time is slow on weekends and peak hours.

I had always purchased my tires at Discount Tire before getting a new set of 4 here. They carry Cooper tires whereas other places usually don't. Pep Boys has some great deals on tires, especially if you get a coupon, or better yet, a cool rebate. I got a "pay for 3 get the fourth free' Deal which was really nice. They also have a full serve auto maintenance department, and everything you could need in the store for your auto or truck.

Went with a party of 6 people who were game for mixing and matching, sharing appetizers and what not. Great- Got to try a ton of things on the menu! Everything was really good, nothing mediocre or crappy. I had the duck, an unusual choice, but wanted to get something that no one else ordered. Fabulous. The crab cakes were great, the cheese and fruit platter was pretty good, Wifey had the beef tenderloin, exceptional... and so on. Even the mussels were great. Service was fair to good, atmosphere was just OK... Not too hip of a place, and I am not a fan of dining outside, but it seemed to work for us at this place. Overall, it's rare I give out the coveted five star rating, but this place had a lot going for it- Creative menu, neat setting, and much more. Try it out!

Stupid name, great place! This arena is the perfect size for concerts and hockey games. I like it much better than America Worst arena in downtown PHX. Plus, I like it here a lot better than arenas in L.A. and OC suck as Staples Center and Honda place in Anaheim. It's a smaller venue than those others in California, and like I said... It's a great size, not a bad seat on the house. The sound is really good for concerts as well, having seen Van Halen, Ozzy, The Who, and many more shows here.

My Wife picked this spot for her Birthday dinner. Great choice! Never even heard of this place before. Now, part of the 5 star experience has to do with a few intangibles that were beyond their control: Weather was perfect, about 80 degrees. I'm usually not a big fan of dining Al Fresco (outdoors), but this evening was just perfect. They have a very nice patio for dining, overlooking the sunset, cacti, and a golf course. No bugs, no excessive heat, no wind...All things that can spoil a Desert Dining Experience.  Food was fantastic. She had crab cakes as an appetizer, I had a beet salad with greens, goat cheese, and vinaigrette dressing. Entrees were filet mignon with au gratin 'taters, and I had a braised short rib in a root beer sauce, french green beans, and a squash side dish... Both veggies were excellent. Dessert came with our prix fixe meal, and they made a swell Birthday cake ensemble for her, and I had a relish creme brûlée that was perfect.  I definitely will return to this place, as I saw people ordering (southwestern) hamburgers with sweet potato tater tots, for about 12 bucks. Looked great.  Service was really professional, not overly friendly, just spot on. This would be a great place to take out of towners to experience a Southwestern dining experience. Near perfect!

Had dinner there with Wifey last night, never been here before. Very nice dining room, lovely decor, spacious & roomy. Bar looked fun as well. Had some low mein and a spicy chicken dish, asked for brown rice and the waiter brought both brown and white. Nice. Lettuce wraps were OK, not as good as Pei Wei or Flo's. Service was impeccable, just perfect. No 4 star rating because everything was great, just fine, just not that out of the ordinary or spectacular. Kind of on the expensive side as well.

I don't do the "Scottsdale Bar-Thing," but I have always enjoyed this classy place for years. I like taking people from out of town here, and I used to take dates, before I got married two years ago (to a wonderful, gorgeous, sexy woman... is that good, Dear)? It used to be touted as a gay bar, but don't let that deter you, hetero Dudes like myself; its a colorful, classy joint, and no one will harm you or look at you funny here!

Been going here for many years, and recently went back when visiting Vegas. Place hasn't really changed in ten years, and that's a good thing. Very reasonably priced, and I usually have breakfast here. Lunch is good to, but if you want high quality, gourmet food for dinner, I steer clear. But, as I said, it's very consistent here, and never really had anything bad at this buffet.

If you are REALLY hungry... I mean like" I've been stranded in the Desert for 3 days hungry"... Go here and order THE MONSTER BURGER!!!!! They also have unlimited french fries, if you are into that gluttony sort of deal. They have some neat drinks, wraps, fantastic onion rings, and be sure and get some of that "Western Sauce" or whatever it is. This is a bad place for a diet!

The Disneyland of furniture stores!!!! Over the many years I've been coming here, I'd have to say, that in the long run, 90% of the stuff I have bought there is still working, functional, and I've certainly got my money's worth. The other 10% says, in life, you get what you pay for, and some stuff has either crapped out or malfunctioned, albeit, after I've got my use out of it. It can also be sort of a fun place to browse, get a bite to eat, and hang out. AC in the summer is cranked, so that's a bonus when it's over 100 degrees outside!

This is a great place to visit, but I wouldn't want to shop there! While its an attraction unto itself, and their inventory is incredible, but there are really no bargains or discounts to be had. I feel the same way about R.E.I. if you are looking for camping gear- They have the stuff, but you can find it for considerably less on e bay, at Walmart, etc. In a nutshell, its a fun place to visit, and you'll find a variety of items that you may be looking for, but you're gonna' pay full retail price and you should expect no discount. Besides, how do you think they're going to pay their air conditioning bill in the summer months?

While I'd like to slam this chain steak house, I just can't... Because the food was great! Wifey had a craving for prime rib, and we had been here before for this entree. I had some kind of a hamburger, and it was absolutely perfect, and so was her prime rib. The service was excellent, and overall the price was great. Not a big fan of chains, but I'd go back here. The couple next to us asked a manager over, and apparently, they are big fans of The outback, and they told the Gal that this was the best one they'd ever been to. I believe them! Great waiter and staff as well.

Great little place with good sushi. Wifey and I have been here about 15 times, and only once was an order sub par. They have coupons in your local mail for two for one and other deals, which makes it very reasonable to go there every once in a while. Quiet little bar, and outdoor seating as well.

Wifey & I went here 3/14/2009... Saturday night at the drive in movie theater! It was sort of like a Twilight Zone episode, going back in time! My parents used to take us when we were really young in Southern California. We brought a pizza (Ray's), lawn chairs, a large cooler with sodas, a small table, and sat outside the car and watched the first of two films. Besides the smoker next to us, it couldn't have been a more perfect evening! You can chat during the film, bring your own munchies (or dinner in our case), and completely relax, all for the price of $6.50 per person! The sound is OK, as it comes out of your car radio. I suggest bringing a "boom box" if you are sitting outside, otherwise you have to blast your radio to hear.   Many people have never been to a drive-in, or they forgot their drive-in etiquette, so here's a not so subtle reminder of things you may have forgotten... 1. When entering the screen area, if the movie has begun, turn off your main headlights as to not blast the screen with light. 2. Drive slow- the parking area is not paved and you'll kick up dust if going over 5 MPH. 3. Smoke away from other people. 4. Keep pets and children to a dull roar- If they aren't interested in watching the film, let them go to the snack bar and play around at the arcade.  Food prices were very reasonable- Hot dog- 2 bucks, hamburger 3 bucks, sno-cones, 1 dollar... But I suggest bringing your own goodies.   Overall, great experience, killer value, excellent facilities, and we'll be back!

Being a So Cal native, I never saw what the big deal is with this place for out of tonwners! Its OK, its a big, sloppy burger. And, its fast food. OK... Big deal. Their french fries suck, they are mushy and crisp. They have a very limited menu, which I guess is sort of the appeal. There are much better burgers in town and I don't think this place is any good at all.

For what this place is, its a winner compared to Denny's, Coco's, or other joints I'd put in the same category. Its fun for kids, with its Bear theme. I have had the fish fry and prime rib specials, both of which were really good! More than generous portions, this place will really fill you up! Avoid if you are on a diet! Great, friendly, attentive service too. The other location in Avondale is the same, just as good.

I have stayed here twice and recommended it to friends who've stayed 4 times. This place is a great bargain, in a not so great location. Sure its cooler to be in or near downtown Scottsdale, but for the price and what you get this place is great! They redecorated some years ago and the rooms are really cool, HDTV, all the amenities you could want, and very cool decor and furniture. Great find in Scottsdale.

This is a big, fun place to visit. Prices are just OK unless its a sale item. (I get most of my musical gear from E Bay). They have lots of guitars, but not too many, or any, used and/or vintage guitars, which is what I look for. They carry other band, string, and symphony instruments that other music stores don't carry. Every department is BIG- Pro audio, home recording, guitars, etc. Nice employees as well, unlike some Guitar Center Dudes that think they are Rock Stars!

What you say... 5 STARS????? OK, let me explain. I have shopped at Food City markets for over 7 years now, and this is one of the nicer stores. Some still may find this place to be a dump, and yeah...Its no AJ's, that's for sure, but I buy all of my produce here because of the price. Basically, its the same company as AJ's and Basha's, just a lot more grungy! But, I went here last week (3/16/2009)  and bought a week's worth of produce for $9.99! Cilantro- 4 for a buck... Red, yellow, orange bell peppers- 69 cents each. (Nice) green leaf lettuce- $1.29. Celery- 69 cents. I could go on, but you get the point! I live in N Scottsdale, and drive to this store and the one on Greenway- They are the two cleanest and closest stores to me. Don't be put off by the appearence or the nationality they seem to favor... I am into bargains, and this place ROCKS!

This is a really good place in a sort of crummy location... Its near nothing, unless you happen to live right there near that particular strip mall. Location aside, its OK dining there, nothing fancy at all. Staff is very friendly, and I like their menu. Had salad and thin crust pizza, very good. I've had delivery a few times as well and its still been pretty good even if lukewarm. Verging on great pizza, and all other food is way above average. I like this place!

Contrary to some other reviews, I do like this place- For sports viewing and decent food! They have lots of TV's with all college and pro football games on, so its pretty easy to watch your out of town team (Oakland Raiders) on one of their screens. Salads are just OK, wings are great, and pizza is better than average. Went here recently for lunch, midweek, and the service was really lousy, like other reviewers had pointed out. But, this is a great place to watch a  game and have some munchies. They are Hockey-Friendly as well!

Hit or miss here, depends on who you "get." But, there's one stylist there who doers a meticulous, thorough job, so I keep coming back. It's about 5 minutes away from my house as well, so that's a huge bonus. Always a good idea to call ahead... Who likes waiting for a half-hour plus-some for a trim? I don't. Place is clean and pleasant, I usually have a coupon too for the $10.99 hair cut. What a deal.

No one can beat Billy's killer setups. Most guitars, even the mega-expensive ones, need a set up after you take them home from the guitar shop. I've taken all (8) of my axes to B & D, with no regrets! Billy has you play for him so he can pick up on your style, then sets up your guitars for your playability. Its the personal attention to detail that can't be beat. I cannot recommend his services enough. 10 stars... Dude.

Atmosphere is OK here, but after a few visits, the food and service kind of sucks. Was there yesterday and the food took a half an hour to arrive at our table. Maybe we had a lame waitress, but this is the second time I've had a lame waitress there. Nachos were just OK, and wings were really good.

I don't know what's going on with these guys who work here... Free beer at lunch? Who knows... But, every time me and/or my Wife have been in this place, the staff is REALLY helpful and friendly! I went there this afternoon to have a battery checked (dead as a doornail) and get an air filter for my Prius. Exceptional customer service as always. They will even help you in the parking lot with things like windshield wipers, etc. I wouldn't go anywhere else for auto parts!

We have bought a lot of our marine/boating supplies here, as well as fishing gear. They have a very helpful staff, especially this fishing Dude named Issac, and they have just about everything you'll need for your outdoor enjoyment. However, I don't find their pricing very stimulating... They have an exceptional inventory, but you are going to pay full retail prices here. I prefer to get outdoor gear on e bay or at Walmart, at discounted prices. But, its a very fun place to browse and shop. The restaurant is pretty good too, and also fun!

This is my favorite restaurant in Vegas! I lived there for 3 years, and it wasn't established until I left. I missed it by a year or so, but have made my way there about seven times now, and seems to have lost nothing since it opened. The whole Swan Court seating was a bit much... I like fine dining but I'm not too pretentious. I don't do the wine pairing either, as I'd rather just swig down Veuve Clicquot during the entire meal anyway. But this place is just fantastic... From the staff to the wine tower, I love this place.

Outdated decor and average, slightly overpriced food. OK, I could end the review right there, but I shall elaborate a bit further.  Seems like Aunt Chiladas has seen some better days. It looks like a water park for midgets outside, when you approach the entrance. Very cool... For 1974.  It's a very colorful place, but seems as though it hasn't changed since the aforementioned year. Just guessing there. Menu items are all priced about 3 dollars to high. Glad I went once, probably won't re-visit.

There's not too much to explore here, but it's worth the trip out here to see the one, main building, that has sat under the same canopy since 1932! Amazing structure, with graffitti from 1870 & earlier, nice place to stop by on the way to somewhere else.

Nice, clean, neighborhood market. It's a bit on the expensive side for every day shopping, but a pretty decent place to pick up a few items, or wine/beer/booze. Once in a while you get some decent specials on meat, fruit & produce. Very friendly staff, place has a good vibe to it. Skip the brick oven pizzas, nothing to write home about.

This place is a wonderland of fabrics and related supplies! Its a virtual warehouse of every kind of fabric you could want or need! I came here because I was told they have the most extensive collection of marine vinyl in The Valley, and after checking out a few other spots, THIS IS IT! I restored my boat seats and got all the fabric from here, as well as the foam for my seats, which they cut for free! Staff is helpful to a straight, non-designer-guy like me! Its even fun just to look around at all the stuff they have here.

Nope...No way... Nuh uh, don't do it. 5 hours after eating here my stomach is still churning. Not in a good way, mind you. And here's a memo to management: When it's 114 degrees outside, I'd like it to be less than 100 INSIDE WHILE I AM EATING!!!! Bad food and inside temps that had me sweating, not a good combo. Also had a rather limited menu, not too many items on it. Just say no.

Went here Jan. 2, 2010 for lunch, when college bowl games were on. A veritable plethora of TV's covering all sports to be had, burger was good, and service was just great! Good selection of beers, clean, and friendly place. Apparently they will be having music on Friday & Saturday nights. I liked the place!

Sad to say I've given up on Trader Joe's since I found this place. Sad, because T.J's started in my hometown of Pasadena, California, but this place ROCKS!!!! We have a full-size freezer in our garage, and I stock up on sale items and bargains from here all the time. Now. we just yank something from our freezer- steaks, chicken, sausage, hamburger meat, etc., defrost, and cook it up that evening. Wifey and I average about 5 bucks a meal this way, absolutely incredible! I have only come across 2 or 3 items of theirs I didn't like, mayonnaise to be one of them, but all their stuff seems pretty good. Bargains on bread and tortillas are great, they have a great assortment of nuts and desserts (I'm not a dessert guy, but the prices and selections are cool), and I love the grill pack- an assortment of marinated chicken, hamburger patties, and sausage, feeds 4-6, all for TEN BUCKS!   Great deals, hybrid parking for us Prius drivers, diet coke always $5.99 a case (24 pack), organic and healthy stuff, packaged meals for convenience, and fresh cheap sushi... Can't beat this place!

The old adage, "You get what you pay for" REALLY applies here to this fancy-assed grocery store. Here's the pluses... Most of their pre-cooked food, sandwiches, iced teas, desserts, sushi and what not is really good, verging on almost always excellent. Here's the one and only minus-  Everyday shopping should be done somewhere else unless you have cash to burn. I get no thrill from paying 2 dollars more for ketchup just because it's a nice joint. Great meat and produce, good beer prices, and even cool gift items & flowers.

I had a less than mediocre experience at the location on Shea Blvd. in Scottsdale. I posted my review on Yelp, and the marketing director actually contacted me, so we tried the Paradise Valley (Mall) location, and what a difference! My Wife actually timed our server, and within 5 minutes, our order was delivered with a smile! I had the brisket, and she had the Jewish sliders. Absolutely delicious! Excellent service, fantastic food, and great experience overall... That, and on one of their busiest days I imagine; Father's Day. We'll be back.

I've never reviewed a gas station, and I'm not sure I ever will again. Long story made short... I got a Sinclair gas (credit) card because they have stations at the dock at both Lake Powell and Lake Mead. When on a boating trip of a few days or more, it'd behoove me to have one of their cards for a slight discount on expensive marina & dock gas prices. Hence, the visit to this station which is no where near where I live, but happened to be in the neighborhood.   What a dump. The cute dinosaur gets you, but it's merely a neat symbol, as the "Quickie-Mart" was dirty, poorly stocked, and lacked some modern ammenities you'd expect in a QT or similar. Avoid.

This place is just weird. It's very crowded, other people seem to like it a lot, but not me. The whole "Country Store" theme throws me for a loop. It's strange. I had some egg-sausage combo for breakfast, that I thought would be a casserole-type thing, but turned out to be just 'taters and tiny pieces of sausage cooked together. Eggs were plain as can be, overall experience was a giant MEHHHHH. No thanks.

Years ago when I lived in Berkeley, California, this was THE place to buy camp gear and outdoors stuff. Now, there's competition, and I don't shop here any more. Why... Prices. Yes, they have a lot of stuff here, and their employees are very knowledgeable. But, I can get the same stuff cheaper elsewhere, and its also a lot more fun to check out gear at Bass Pro or Cabelas! I don't buy into the whole co-op thing either- Prices are still too high for me.

I was looking for a coffee joint in this area, and had passed about 20 Starbucks cruising around. Most of the time, I like to check out an independent place rather than hit up a chain. In this case, I ended up finding a Starbucks on my GPS after throwing my iced latte' from Pink Spot in the trash. Granted this seemed like a really cute place, in a funky-cool location, and I didn't have any ice cream. But this was simply AWFUL coffee! My wife's hot latte was terrible as well. Maybe it's a cool place, and maybe the ice cream is great. But, those coffee drinks were very bad, bottom line. Nope.

Near the Altell Ice Den on Bell road. There's a few exceptional details about this gas station/convenience store... There's a full service car wash and detailing service, and if you are waiting on one of these services, there's a guest lounge you wouldn't believe-  HD tv's (not just one), all leather furniture, free wi-fi, and you can view the work being done on your car through the window. The convenience store is huge, clean, and hardly ever a crowd. Wide variety of sodas and beer, as well as the usual soda fountains and fast food to go. You'll find a 15 door 'fridge with wines, champagnes, and beer. No need for Starbucks, as there's a coffee bar here. There's even a cafe in this joint, with excellent breakfast burritos that are giant, delicious & cheap! The other food is really good as well. Outside, they are the only place I've seen in the Valley that carries 100 octane (racing) fuel, which we've put in our boat a few times! No 5 star rating because the gas isn't cheap here, but this is a unique spot definitely worth a stop in!

Not bad, but way too expensive for what you get! My Wife and I had passed this place numerous times, and each trip She'd say, That place has great sandwiches." So, last time we were near She stopped in and got us lunch... OK sandwich, nothing special (Safeway Deli is MUCH better), but it set her back some 14 frickin' dollars! I'll pass.

Most of these Chinese Buffet places are crap... Greasy, sticky, unimaginative cuisine, just quantity over quality. This place is different, and I like it very much! Wifey and I have been a few times, and I took my in laws there recently as well. Things are fresh here, unlike other Chinese buffets (Paradise Valley). They have somewhat decent sushi, and fresh fruit as well. They also have dessert, if you are into that. I would recommend this place and we will be back again!

The emissions testing place. Very exciting. The day I visited it was all 4 lanes, about 10 cars/trucks deep. Have to say it went faster than I anticipated. And at a rate of only $20.00, I was happy to get in and out. My Prius, a non-emission vehicle, amazingly passed. Go figure.

This is a fun place to shop, and a fun place to be! Why? Well, its clean, and the North Scottsdale clientele is above average to look at if you are a hetero-Dude such as myself. Translation- Hot Soccer Moms! LOL!!! Besides the eye candy, everything is under one roof. I mean, isn't this what America is all about... I was there yesterday & bought some marine supplies for my boat, eggs, beer, a shirt, a magazine, BBQ charcoal, some gardening gear, and some other stuff. Its a wonderland of consumerism, and not low class and grungy like many other locations around the country. I like this place!

I've tried other locations, and liked this chain a lot. However, Had lunch here, just the salad bar and an iced tea, and wasn't impressed at all. Very ordinary, nothing different, unusual, or even that good. Yeah, sure... It was clean, well stocked, yada-yadda... But I just wanted a quick bite and it set me back 14 bucks (w/  tip). Not worth it! Service was really good though.

Very solid spot for fast food style, yet homemade quality Mexican food. Had shrimp fajitas, priced right at about $8.99, was really good. Wife likes the steak quesedilla from here, tried it, very good as well. Funky smell coming from bathrooms could be fixed in an instant with charcoal filters. That would be my only complaint. They also have this cute, tiny, full bar, in case you feel like putiing a few back! And again, prices are very fair. Like it a lot!

This is a great place if money is no object to you! Although clean, modern, fresh, and chic, you get what you pay for... A fashionable spot to eat your 4 ounces of frozen yogurt! My wife and I each got a small, hers with a few fruit toppings, mine plain. You then pay by weight, and the two items were over 8 dollars! To me, the place is a total ripoff, no matter how cool or delicious it is. My Wife would probably give this joint a 5 star rating, but I can think of ten-thousand better things to spend my money on!

Nice new store up near the Anthem area off I-17. Bought a cot there for camping, it broke first time out, had to return it. Absolutely no hassle whatsoever! I was very pleased with return policies, the one thing that would factor in a decision to shop there again. Most businesses honor a receipt for 90 days, they have a 4 month policy. Nice! Only reason I don't give them a 5 star rating is that you are pretty much going to pay full retail prices for their merchandise. No discounts to be had here!

A Dollar Store in Paradise Valley? Say it isn't so! How could they have ever let this happen?  Although not the largest (see 99 Cent store Tempe, Southern & Rural), this place in clean, not located in Grungeville Central like most of their establishments, and its located right across the street from the PV Mall. Also located at this center are Toys R Us, Pier One, Sportsmart, & other stores you might want to hit up.  I like the 99 Cent Stores for my camping goods and needs, party supplies, throw-away shower curtains for paint projects, cheapy tools, and much more. This store just happens to be located next to many other shops I frequent, and that's why I like it!

There is a store, bar, bait shop, gas station & restaurant here- This review is JUST for the store.   Conveniently located 8 miles from Cholla Campground at Lake Roosevelt, this one-stop-shop has so much stuff crammed into a little space its just fun to check it out! They have almost every item you'd need besides groceries (Head on over to the Tonto Basin Marketplace for those items), including the all important Tonto National Forest pass for camping & boats, jet skis, trailers, etc. Reasonable prices to boot! Forgot something on your trip to the Lake- batteries, canned chili, a life vest, ski rope, sunglasses, beer???? Stop in and grab some stuff! They have it!

In the corner of the Albertson's/Target shopping center, I don't find this place all that great, just sort of "there!" Once in a while I'll stop in here, and I've found a few things to buy- a video camera case, a sweatshirt, etc. etc. I prefer Marshall's at Desert Ridge and most all of the Ross stores in the area, compared to this place.

OK... What's so special about a place that sells water and ice? They sell 25 pound bags of ice... For $2.50! If you are having a party, or going camping such as we do, its a pain in the rear to mess with those little 7-8 lb. (mini) bags of ice. This is the only place around this area that I know of that carried these giant sized bags of ice! We stock up on purified drinking water here as well- Bring in your container and tank up, Baby! Special parking for ice customers only right in front, carts to carry heavy items to the car, or, they will load it for you.

Off of Bell rd. near 101 and The Alltell Ice Den, this is a viable alternative to the post office off of Raintree at Airpark. That place can be very crowded & the lines long. Try here instead, especially for residents of McDowell Mountain & Greyhawk neighborhoods. Full-service post office as well as some copy and graphic jobs.

Finally tried this place after passing it weekly for the last year or so. Atmosphere is pretty cool, but food lacked any special quality. Large glass of orange juice was nearly $6.00...WITHOUT the vodka (lol)! Hash browns were kind of burned, and small portion to boot. Probably won't go back, as there are so many other breakfast places nearby that are much better.

Went here on Christmas day after church just to try it out. Food is what you'd expect, nothing special, nothing horrible. But, the service was atrociously slow... Waited 45 minutes before they took our order. Waitress was apologetic and very friendly, but maybe they were short handed because of the Holiday. Nonetheless, nothing would make me return here!

My Wife and I have been taking our cars here for a couple of years now, 2006 Honda CRV & 2008 Toyota Prius. Since they are newer cars and reliable models/brands, one wouldn't expect to have to do any major repairs, which has been the case. However, when waiting in the lobby on for our oil changes and such, I've overheard the techs dealing with customers that have major repairs and they are very detailed in their explanations, and by and large, they do not seem like ripoff artists AT ALL, which is usually the case with these auto fix-it places, Even with just a simple oil change they inspect the vehicle thoroughly, even telling this lady last time I was there that her license plate light was out (and it'd be $8.00 to fix). Clean, friendly, thorough place, and they'll even give you a ride home or to work if the repair takes a while.

After being a loyal JC Penney customer for 10 years or so, I finally gave up on them, and cancelled my credit card with them. Why? Well, here's the bottom line. I used to get sales flyers and special deals in the mail every month, and they'd be incredible deals. When I stopped receiving them, it was apparent that they had changed their marketing strategy, and were trying to become more of a "Macy's type" store. But, the difference between Macy's and Penney was that the merchandise in JC Penney was crappy, almost on the level of Walmart, and they were now charging Macy's prices!  Gone were the deals. Gone was the variety of inventory. And the final straw... Went to get a coffee maker there and they only carry their Cooks brand of small appliances, and it crapped out on me after about 3 weeks. That did it for me.  I have no complaint with the staff, cleanliness of the store, etc. In fact, it was a great location and nice place to shop. It simply became a shadow of its former self as far as inventory and prices.  I read an article just this morning about how they are going to be going back to being more of a discount merchandising retail store, and this is a move in the right direction. Let's give it 3-5 months, and I'll see.

My wife has been on a frozen yogurt trip this summer, so I get sucked into taking her to the local spots near our home. Of all the places we've tried, I like this one the best, better than Yogurtology (complete ripoff), and Golden Spoon. This joint is chic, clean, and cool, and the teeny-bopper employees are very friendly and happy to be alive & employed! Their product tastes the best of the other 3 mentioned places, and it's reasonably priced as well. It's over near Best Buy, Wendy's, in that Walmart shopping plaza between Raintree and Frank Lloyd Wright.

Deecent, clean place for rehearsals. No 5 star rating for the lack of cold AC when it's over 100 degrees, which can be often here in Chandler. Helpful and friendly front desk Dudes make this place a winner. Excellent (guitar) gear available, so you don't have to haul your own stuff.

A great place at reasonable prices. Had 2 different projects completed here... Took my restored 1962 Shasta camper seats here, had them make new ones for me. I bought the foam, they did the upholstery. Way better than I expected, super professional job, and I was more than happy! Then, I took my tall patio chairs in to be recovered, and they did another perfect job. They look fantastic. Friendly staff, super thorough. highly recommended!

Not a big fan of donuts, but I like this place for the iced coffee! It's a tad less expensive than "Fourbucks," just down the road, and way less hassle. They've added little breakfast sandwiches which are ok in a crunch. Drive through seems to never be crowded, great when in a hurry in the afternoon.

How difficult is it to make a decent pizza? Not too tough. Alas, this joint has gone downhill and we won't be returning. They used to have a deal where you'd get the antipasta salad with a medium pizza for about 20 bucks, drinks not included. They changed their menu, and we went ahead and ordered that same thing... with drinks, 36 bucks total! Not worth the 20 it was before. The pizza was very dry, not enough sauce, and we even ordered it with extra cheeses, and it was pretty lame. Salad was OK, service was great, but, to me, a 36 dollar lunch should be a gourmet experience!

I literally live around the corner from this place. I was scared to go for a while because I might end up liking the place, and I could become "a regular!" So, one day my game wasn't on TV, so I ponied up and went over to check it out. First off, the place is clean, spacious, modern, with tons of TV's for sports. Too bad it's a Nebraska bar on Saturdays, being a USC fan myself! But, nonetheless, Stella on tap for 3 bucks... can't be beat! They do allow you to smoke on the back patio, if you're into that. Food seemed to be OK, and as my game was ending, families came in for supper, a good sign! Greg, the owner is a super friendly guy, who seems to be just hanging out all the time! No 5 stars only because I wish they had a little bit better of a beer selection, say dark, porter's, other ales on tap!

Badda-Boom, Badda-Bing... We have a winner! I used to frequent this establishment in Las Vegas when I lived there, and now, all of a sudden, 17 years later... I work down the street from this place! Yippee for me! Clean well-run, friendly joint, with GREAT sandwiches. Try this place out, and remember... Friends don't let friends eat at Subway.

Our band played here last Saturday night... Great, laid-back place. Clean, nice patio area, excellent food w/ huge portions, VERY friendly staff, all the things you'd want in a cool, neighborhood bar. They have lot's of HD big screens, so I imagine in the Fall/Winter football viewing would be nice here as well.

Used to be Oggie's Pizza. Same place, just a little touched up. Went there for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Nachos were more of a salad concoction, like a taco salad, with the most bland salsa I've ever tasted- Tasted like thick tomato juice! Had a roast beef sandwich, which was toasted and I was never asked if I wanted it toasted, which I would have said no! In fact, it was burnt, I mean black! Couldn't taste the cheese, was dry as a board, had no sauce, lettuce, tomato, mayo, etc. etc. Wife had a antipasto salad with really vinegar-y vegetables, very little lettuce, and a bunch of cold cuts wrapped together with cheese. It was hardly a salad. I'd have to say the food was less than mediocre, verging on pretty bad! What's a bummer is that the pizza joint on Mcdowell Mountain ranch that  changed locations was actually pretty good, and this place simply isn't any good at all. Blecch! The bar is nice, there's lot's of room, space, and plenty of TV's. I might go back here to have a beer & watch a game. I'll never eat here again.

Tried this joint out the other night after driving by the place for a year or so, was pleasantly surprised. It's definitely "gringo" Mexican food, but it was really fresh and tasty. Much better than other gringo-mex places such as Chipotle and Baja Fresh. Its a partial fast food place in that you order at the counter and they bring it to your table on trays, also with a fill your own soda fountain. They have very nice tables and booths, and the place was extremely clean and presentable. Not sure I'll make a habit of frequenting this spot, because I prefer more authentic, spicy mexican food, but this is a good place for folks with mild palettes.

How is one "Fourbucks" different from another? Well, there aint no difference, really! It's just a matter of where they are located. They are all too expensive for what they serve. This one did have a fat guy sleeping in the corner with his laptop ready for the taking... Not a good indication that the caffeine is working here. Grande flavored latte for the Wife, iced double espresso for me... That be about 9 bucks, thank you. True meaning of the phrase "MEH!"

Yup... a bit on the expensive side, but I won the tickets to Jay Mohr from a radio station, so that eased the pain a tad. Wifey & I ate here as well, salad and a burger, which was really good and fairly priced. Seating, lighting, sound, all good. They will validate your parking if you park in their garage, which I didn't know at the time we got our tickets at the box office. Overall, I'd have to say it was a really good experience, but I would REALLY want to see the headliner to shell out 150 bucks for an evening's worth of entertainment.

I can't get too excited about a freakin' car wash. But, this place is a great value for only 3 bucks! The staff is friendly, the vacuum area is really clean,  and it's easy to get to from the 101 or Scottsdale rd. Bring a towel, as my car is always wet after the drive through experience.

I am a fan of all these Aliberto's, Filiberto's, Antonio-Berto's, Stephanopolis-Berto's places. Most all are filthy, in lousy locations & neighborhoods, but the food is usually pretty damn good and inexpensive. Also, I think they are all 24 hours as well. Not only is this location 24 hours, but it's also clean, & in an area where I don't feel like I will be shot at, and the food is really good and very reasonably priced! So glad the concept has moved into the mainstream, and would love to see more Scottsdale locations (hint, hint... Like in my neighborhood up in N. Scottsdale... Mr. 'Berto)!

Been here twice now, and both times have been an A+, first rate experience. Not only do they do great work, but their customer service is fantastic. One occasion, I was paying out of pocket. Very reasonable priced. The other, was an insurance-handled deal. They had a rental car all setup for me before I arrived. I received daily updates on their progress on my vehicle. Wouldn't even think about taking my vehicles in the future anywhere else.

Super friendly service, and more than reasonable rates. Love it! I'd be back here for all jewelry repair and watch stuff. The Dude added a link to my wife's Rolex, and tried different sizing (adjusted a few notches) 3 times until it was perfect. She was extremely happy once it was done. Great service.

My Wife sends me here every year to pick up a bunch of lotions for Christmas gifts, and all the recipients of these gifts seem to love the stuff! I don't know much about Goat Milk Lotion, nor do I use the stuff, but if I keep going back here and everyone is happy with the results, I guess we have a winner! Seems the lavendar lotion is the one first choice of the different varieties. Always a friendly staff as well.

Unique place, in that you fill out your bag, which "builds" your sandwich with the stuff you want on it... What kind of bread, mayo, mustard, lettuce, spinach, etc. etc. Cool concept. Much better than Subway, where you actually have to speak with the person making your sandwich. (We all hate that, right)? Anyway, really fresh toppings and bread at this joint, friendly and clean environment, will come back here again.

THREE DOLLARS for a car wash! This is what America is all about! They also have free vacuums with purchase of a wash. It's usually not crowded here, and I can be in and out (with a good self dry) in 12-15 minutes. It's conveniently located right off the 101 freeway. It's my Go-To car wash these days.

Here's an independent guitar store, with some rare, unusual, and interesting instruments in it. They have a master luthier on the premises for custom jobs and repairs. Very attentive service with a smile, and worth checking out to browse, or if you are looking to add another "Baby" to your collection. It's behind Frasier's Steak House on Scottsdale Rd.

First time was the last time. It wasn't so bad. But, after eating there, my Wife says to me, "Would you ever come back here?" Answer was a definitive no! Hence, the 2 star rating. Burger was really greasy, sweet potato fries were... Merhhhh... Onion rings (Haystacks) were very thin and, just... Mehhhh. I also don't like this new trend of fast food restaurants pretending to be gourmet dining, with no service. It's another do it yourself deal, and for 24 bucks for two, I want a waiter or waitress, thanks very much. One & done, Smashburger. See ya!

OK, so after 2 tries, I'm giving this a 2 star review, which is a bit negative. Place is colorful as all get-out, and fun, loud, and kind of exciting first time you visit. After the 2nd time though, I think it's a tad overpriced for all the fanfare. And, yet we have another fast food joint, made to be a restaurant, where you have to pick up your own food.   Note to all restauarnt owners... If I want to pay high prices for food, bring it to me! I don't want to stand in line, I don't want to wait for my name to be called, just bring the damn thing to my table. Hell... Even Carl's Jr. brings your order to where I am sitting. I'm not lazy. It's just stupid to pay restaurant prices for fast food, in a sense. It's not that often I crave a chili dog. But I can grab a can of Hormel's chili for a buck, and package of hot dogs for 2 bucks, and with cheese and inions, I can feed myself and 4 friends for about a buck each. What's the difference between my deal and this place? About Ten Frickin' Dollars I tell ya'. I can get a better hot dog at Costco, thank you very much. Won't be returning.  And all you people from Chicago... Always talking about your town... Selling out the Diamondback games when your beloved Cubs are in town... Welcome Chicago to the Desert, etc. etc. Why did ya'all leave, and why are you here, if it's such a gosh-darn great town?????????

In the tradition of Southern California's Filibertos, we have the new Federicos here in Scottsdale. Gotta' say- Very solid! We had a 2 for one combo coupon, so we got 3 combos and shared. Enchiladas were pretty good, but the 2 burrito (carne asada type meat) combo was fantastic. The 3 combo plates ended up being lunch, dinner, and snack for the 2 of us. The portions are HUGE here. I didn't really care for the carne asada fries, as I am not into the American version either: chili cheese fries (a pile of greasy mush, to me). It was prepared all right, just not my thing. The place really needs some decor, a TV, ANYTHING to liven it up a bit! It's very boring on the inside! They do have a few tables on the patio, and there is drive up service as well. As in other places of this sort, they have a fill your own salsa bar, with delicious & spicy red and green salsas. It'd be nice if they had 2 more flavors. Food is really good, portions are gigantic, so overall it gets 4 stars from me. Just needs some ambience... Tunes, TV, wall art, etc.

Nearly impossible to find, but well worth it once you have! Great selection of salads and sandwiches, and extremely reasonable prices as well. Wife had an eggplant parmesan sandwich, and I had the Italian Meatball sandwich. Fantastic. Really tasty, authentic flavorings. Place has a laid back, cool atmosphere as well. 6 thumbs up on this joint, try it out. (Directions- From Frank Lloyd Wright heading east, turn right on Redfield, first driveway on your right gets you into the Visions Center. Park, walk to center of building, downstairs. Elevator access too).

Went here for a concert, Deep Purple, and although facility was adequate, it was a little "funky." Here's the deal... It's basically an event ballroom, not really a concert venue. They set up the ballroom, convention seats in rows, and there you have it! It's not at all like stadium seating or anything remotely close to that. All seats are on one level. But, it seems to work! The venue was very clean, nearby restrooms were immaculate, and refreshments were available inside the "hall" and on the outside. Sound was OK, but it wasn't like 1974 where they set a record as the world's loudest band! I'd go to another concert if I liked the band, but probably not if it weren't a group or artist I really liked. Added bonus- I live about 10 minutes from this place, so HEY! Groovy!

Don't know much about furniture stores, prices, etc. etc. So, I will say a few things in my limited knowledge of such places. This place is HUGE, and it's a lot of fun to just stroll through the store for 20 minutes if nothing else. I specifically came here looking for a light wood with metal king size bed frame, but no luck finding anything like that. I know our other bedroom pieces came from Copenhagen, (more expensive and seemingly a bit better quality), so I may have to back there and find what I am looking for. The stuff here seems very reasonably priced, and it's mostly traditional- In other words, I am more of a "Bova" kind of Dude, and there's a lot of brown stuff in here, which isn't my bag. Overall, the inventory looks very conventional and reasonably priced, so I can't give them 3 stars, even though most of the stuff I'm not interested in personally.

Really great concept... It's the Subway of build-it-yourself pizza. Without being Subway! It's relatively inexpensive, side salads are around 3 bucks. The pizze dough itself is more like a crunchy flatbread, so it's not as high-calorie as regular pizza either. Been here a few times now, and it's also very fast at lunch, if you are in a hurry.

OMG!!! A Ninety-Nine Cent Only store that's NOT in a ghetto, is actually clean and organized, and the staff was friendly and helpful? The end of the world must be near! I know it's brand new, but I do hope they stay the way they are, because no other 99 Cent store even comes close in comparison this one!

OK, so if you are here, you probably aren't happy about it. Unless you are a lawyer or "Document Dude," it's because something went wrong. Hence, no 5 star reviews for this place. However, like many other municipal entities in Scottsdale, this place is clean, efficient, and people are generally friendly. I was here for a red light running, camera ticket. Took me about 5 minutes to get what needed taken care of (sign up for traffic school), and I was in and out, no problem!

Good stuff, Man! We always get The Barros Special, which is a really great pie. Antipasta salad is always fresh and good, and the sides (cheese bread, mozzarella sticks, etc.) are always pretty delish. Delivery is consistent and punctual.

Cool place, like Smart and Final on a billion steroids! Yes- It's more of ea restaurant supply, warehouse-deal, but, they have some great deals on the smaller stuff if you try looking. Bought a bag of green leaf, chopped lettuce for about $2.50, and some other fun stuff. If you have a large family, 14 roommates, etc. I'd shop here. I live kind of far away to make this my Go-To spot, but if in the area, I'd hit it up again for sure!

Super nice location, very nicely decorated, as compared to other locations that seem overly cluttered. Food was good, service was excellent, great experience overall. When you are super hungry for a burger, this is the place to be. Added bonus, we were here on a Saturday, and there were plenty of TV's for watching football games. I really wouldn't think of going here to crack back a few brews and watch a game, but I would NOW!

I hadn't been to downtown Scottsdale for many years, as it's just not my scene (I don't drink and drive, and I'd much rather party in my back yard with a pool & BBQ). When did downtown turn into a mini Las Vegas? LOL! Ha! But, hey... I went to this place to see a concert, Michael Schenker, hard rock guitarist for Scorpions, and UFO. I thoroughly enjoyed the show and the venue. I was able to stand right up next to the stage without being pushed and shoved like a mosh pit. Again, I don't drink & drive, so I had nothing to do with drinks, bartenders and drink prices. I'd definitely come here again if there was someone I wanted to see. It was clean, spacious, comfortable and fun.

Yes, they charge a bit more for their services, slightly higher than the MVD. But, I'd gladly pay more and save an hour or more of my time than sit around the germ-ridden, disgusting Department of Motor Vehicles. This is a great option and alternative!

I see no reason to ever come back here. Never heard of the chain until receiving a flier in the mail. Thought I'd check it out on a Saturday when I had time, and I'm glad I did... So I'll know never to go back here! It's not that it's a bad place, it's just that there was nothing special to it, and the prices were a little higher than where I regularly shop. The seafood department was nice, had some great stuff in stock. That, I will give them. Other than that, I'll pass.

The pizza was pretty good, and salads very good. Friendly, small, family run place where the food is pretty good. HOWEVER... The dining room was deplorable. I mean, it was terribly run down. There was an old, crusty/rusty deep fryer next to the soda machine, just sitting there. Seriously, take it out back, put it in an alley, store it somewhere else. On the way to the bathroon, there was a broken (glass) picture frame in the hall where some kid could injure themselves on that. Truly a hazard. Bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned in 3 weeks, waste paper basket was overflowing, etc. I think this place could be OK, and I'd love to change my review if I ever made it back there (don't live close by). But, pay attention to some details, clean the joint up, splash on some fresh paint, put up some newer decorations, etc. The condition of the place far outweighed the quality of food.
