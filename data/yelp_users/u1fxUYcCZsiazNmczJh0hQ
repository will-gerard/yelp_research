Seriously best whole in the wall Mexican food! The menu is simple and they perfect everything on it. I highly recommend the green chili burrito. Careful it's addicting.

Just went to DBG for the first time last weekend to test out a new camera. I can't believe it took me 5 years to get here. The grounds are beautiful , everything was in bloom for spring. The butterfly exhibit was so much fun. I am signing up as a member today . I plan to go back next weekend to visit my butterfly friends .

Best Kept Secret in Phoenix! If you havent been here, then you need to give it a try! This should be on your bucket list of things to check out in Phoenix. I have been here several times and the food is never disappointing . I have tried almost every appetizer on the menu ...lots of love in the food. Very dark and romantic in the basement area.

I wish they would open other locations in the Valley , but not enough to franchise and lose the quality. Really I am jealous of all the residents that live within biking distance of this beautiful place.  Everything here is nothing but the best, the food , the quality of people, the music , the vibe , all of it reminds me of a cool place I would find in a major hip city.

Oh My Heaven... I can't believe I haven't yelped La Grande Orange .  I am so in love with LGO , I wish I could be an apprentice back in the kitchen and learn how to make EVERYTHING . I have had almost everything on the menu and love it . When I am running to the office ahead of schedule, I treat myself to breakfast , Crepes are beautiful , the Birchermuesli , the day breaker , you really can't go wrong with anything you choose. The Banana nut muffin is one of the best I have ever had . The Salads are amazing , I've been eating the Thai chicken salad twice a week , trying to figure out how to make it .  I really want to try the Bloody Marys one of these weekends. I had one at their sister restaurant "The misfit " in Santa Monica. I hope it's just as good . LGO should be on your Bucket List . Now Go !

Ok! I have been here 100 + times and never given Postino a review! All I have to say is Postino's should be on everyone's bucket list of places to try once in your life. Everything on the menu is really good. My favorite of course is the Bruschetta board with all of them except Salmon. Nothing wrong with Salmon , I just don't care for Salmon period, but I'm sure its exquisite.  My husband I split a board with a Mediterranean Salad and Wine . All pairs well with wine or beer . Perfect place to hang out when its nice out which is almost year round.

My husbands back went out, so bad to the point he couldn't  stand on his own and would cry trying to sit up. He had gone to a chiropractor yesterday and they said he needed an MRI to confirm the severity.unfortunately he could physically get to a radiologist in time.   I decide to  take my husband to the ER because he coolant even go potty with out my help, I was really worried about him.   From the moment i walked in , I asked the ER administrator for assistance getting my husband out of the car and I get this crazy nurse who is yelling at me that she is busy and doesn't have time. I felt like she was telling me to o away. So I asked if there was another hospital close by. Immediately they get two staff members to help.  After being checked in and a nurse practitioner starts ridiculing my husband for coming to an emergency room for back pain and requesting an MRI. Every question my husband answered came with a sneer response back from the nurse. Finally I was livid at that point and asked his boss the RN, if we are wasting their time being here. I called another hospital that knew about the situation and welcomed us.   Every person we encountered was just miserable and it showed well. Never again. I will give my business with arrowhead health from here on out.

Furniture Affair is the best store to pick up high end furniture for half the cost. There are a lot of items to look at and it can be overwhelming because the some of the items are heavily used.  I have picked up beautiful artificial plants and trees for the home . I probably saved over 300.00.

I first heard of Red Devil because a friend of mine who used to live in Phoenix needs to stop by when she is visiting her family.  I needed to know what the fuss was about and so I gave it a try. We ordered two salads, veggie pizza and wings.   The house salads was really fresh and the dressing (ranch) was really good, the pizza was not overly greasy, if you want traditional pizza, this is the place and the sizes are fair too. The wings are amazing, although I could always use more sauce, they were perfectly crispy, not too dry and didn't have the frozen taste you sometimes get with some the other family pizza places.

I had such a wonderful time last Saturday picking the best peaches I have ever had.  This is the perfect place to bring your family for a weekend outing , they have a hayride to the orchard and a cute train, plus a general store / bakery with lots of yummy food. I picked up a box of peaches and a pie , plus other fresh produce for 50.00. Wow it was not what I was expecting to spend , but these peaches are some of the best I've had.  The only down fall , where the lines to check out . I really wanted a peach cinnamon roll , but the line was too long while holding everything else I purchased.

You can't go wrong with anything at Houston's or any of the hillstone restaurants . I usually stick to my usual and get grilled artichoke , house salad and baby back ribs. I do like the prime rib dip and the filet , but I'm mostly  Im obsessed with the grilled artichoke and the delicious remoulade as a dipping sauce. My other favorite are the fork tender baby back ribs. The sauce is addicting and worth every penny that you won't want to share a bite .

O....M.....g... We just had the most amazing experience ever. First Father's Day at Houston's here in Scottsdale and went to go pay for the bill and the waiter says it was anonymously taken care of. Someone took care of our bill. Wow. I've been hearing about this 'Paying it Forward' thing going around but never would have expected it to happen to us. So cool.   We had the ribs (always a hit and my favorite) and shared their amazingly simple yet delicious garden salads with a side of broccoli for the little one who loved it. As a joint Father's Day and my birthday dinner, it couldn't have been more perfect.  PS - thank you Jeff for taking such good care of us! Very attentive!

I love Randy's so much I have them on speed dial.  It's the perfect stop on the way to work for good old fashion breakfast. Nothing fancy, however the food is homemade with no short cuts and delicious. How did Drive Inn's, Diners and Dives miss this gold mine? This place is an institution.   My fav's are:  Breakfast  : # 5  1/2 order of French toast , eggs, 1 bacon and 1 sausage link for $4.75 # 15  1/2 waffle  , eggs, 1 bacon and 1 sausage link for $4.75 Banana Pancakes and the breakfast sandwich is good too.  Lunch:  Lasagna is made with homemade sauce and perfect portions of ricotta. Served with garlic bread and a fresh green salad. Note to self: I need to go for lunch more often.

Nothing fancy about this place. I had to check it out because my boss has been lunching here for the past 10+ years. I now understand why.  The sandwiches and homemade deli salads are delicious. I had a Salami and Provolone sandwich the French roll was fresh as can be and I ordered a small potato salad that was as good as it looks. I also added a homemade brined kosher pickle, it was different , but not in a bad way , actually really good .  I highly recommend stopping off here, support your local restaurants ! Casella's is now in my top 5.

The lunch portions are big and will give them that , but the service not so much! The only service we got from the waiter was taking our order and bring our check. I ordered orange chicken and a kids meal . Both good but nothing to wow about . I asked for a kids water with a straw and I never got it. The waiter asked me 20 minutes later if I still want that water. The food came at a reasonable amount of time , however they didn't bring the extra napkins that I asked for which is imperative when dining with children. It took another 10-15 minutes to get our check after the plates gone away . I put in $20 for a $15 bill and I was planning to tip 20%.  I waited another 10 minutes for my change to come back since the waiter was doing other things. He came back and asked if  wanted change and I said yes because there is no way I'm leaving a $5 tip for crappy service .  Then it took another 10-15 minutes to get my change. All i can say that will be my last time at Flo's.

I wish I had a resource to see reviews on this medical group before I wasted time seeing them . Every time I've goon the time in the waiting room and then in the patient room has always been no less than an hour . Expect to wait 1-2 hours to see the doctor or nurse practitioner.  I had to have an MRI due to irregular blood work, Simon Medical sent them information with 24hrs and when I called two weeks after the MRI , the records person still had not updated my records. I went back and forth with them trying to get results, I finally gave up and decided to contact Simon get a copy of my MRI and see a new endocrinologist.  Back on July 13th I requested a copy of my records for the new doctor, followed directions, sent a form in and to this  day nothing. My New Doctor has contacted them several times and no one has responded. I am really disappointed about the professionalism in this office and not having the curiosity to communicate, it just confirms there lack of concern for their patients and I know now I made the right choice by moving on with a new doctor.

I am here every other week to pick up breakfast on my way to the office. They have great quick breakfasts you can order to go. It's cheaper than the nasty Deli in my office building. You can't beat the prices for the "quick start" options. I am so excited they expanded the restaurant, the plentiful bar seating is perfect if you need to eat and go quickly.

Not so much for me . Last years participants was not impressive. I would rather spend more money and go to one of the bigger events like devoured , feast on the streets , or taste of biltmore. My friends that go like it because its family friendly so i can see that point of view , it is family friendly and a nice way to kick off the summer.

I remember casually hearing about The Persian Room a few years back and never put it on my list .. My husband where on our way to a different restaurant and I opened my Yelp App to see what else was in the area and decided to try something new. Boy am I glad we took the detour! We arrived around 7:00 PM couldn't get immediate seating, so we sat at the bar .  I love sitting at the bar because you tend to get more attention. The bartender educated us on how to order and even gave us yummy suggestions for leftovers .  We started off with the complementary wood fired house made naan , that was served with fresh cilantro , basil, onion and butter on the side to top on your bread with . It was happy hour until 8PM, so we ordered Hummus and Tzatziki (that was  1/2 off), both are really good and highly recommended.   We shared the taste of Persia for two ; the plate came on this gorgeous silver platter with enough food for four (I guess that's the Persian way of eating) , three kabobs (filet , chicken and a ground beef) a huge side of rice and a side salad of finely chopped tomato , cucumber and onion with lemon vinaigrette. The kabobs were so tender you can cut it up with a fork, the rice and salad was amazing too.  I was really impressed with the food and our whole experience , I plan to bring out of town guest for a cool experience . This is the perfect place to share family style.

AZ88 Is a cool simple lunch spot. The menu is not complicated but the way the food its put together is divine. I had the Truck Garden Chicken Sandwich - Marinated in fresh lemon juice and peppercorn. The radish and cucumber that accompanied the sandwich balanced it out and made every bite refreshing. I would like to come back and try a burger...and maybe a cocktail too.  .

I had lunch today with coworkers (8 of us) and Chelsea's was exceptional as usual. The service was slow for showing up at 11:30, but then again it seemed as if everyone was showing up around the same time. Luckily the food was amazing as always and you can't rush love. I will be back . Hopefully for the restaurant week dinner.

I loved it. Sierra Bonita is a must try. We invited our family and everyone raved about how great the food is and they want to come back and bring others. I like the fact the chips are optional. We ordered chips and Guac and the chips were perfectly crisp and the guacamole was so fresh and yummy. My husband can't stop raving about the Smoked Red Chili Pork Roast . Reminded me of a dish my mom used to make and was one of my favorites growing up. I was boring and ordered a salad and tamale, but the salad and tamale was light and delicious.  I will for sure come back again.

My reviews are pretty much good and some of the places I don't care for ; never really in between , so I apologize .  Bobby Q is AWESOME! My husband and I drive by when going to the airport and its always strikes curiosity .  My husband picked me up from the airport and we decided to give it ago.  The restaurant was much nicer than expected and cool atmosphere actually.  My husband had the bobby q burger which was yummy and the beer battered fries ...delish. I ordered brisket and baby back ribs with the intention to have leftovers, The brisket was perfectly cooked , so moist and flavorful. The Ribs ; perfect Smokey flavor and fork friendly.  If you ever questioned on whether you should check it out or not...JUST DO IT !

I had brunch at St Francis today . From the moment i stepped in , the who restaurant smelled like good food. I had the gravy biscuit topped with a fried egg. The gravy was not the typical heavy gravy, it was made with the perfect béchamel savory sauce with homemade sausage . This seriously the  best biscuits and gravy  I have ever had. I also had a yummy fresh Bloody Mary. If I had my i-pad with me I would have hung out until dinner.  I highly recommend it , I will for sure be back to try lunch and dinner, several times.

It's hard for me to put myself out there like this, but the incredible blessings they give to others is unparalleled to any I know.  For some, the services might be considered expensive if it's coming out of pocket, but I feel that the price is more than appropriate considering the level of care and attention to their patients. I've been through an infertility journey for more than 5 years and finally we are pregnant. My care has been in the best hands and we have so much gratitude for Zoneraich and his staff.

I love Nordstrom's Cafe . This one isn't as nice as the others I've been too around the country, but the food is really good for an easy reasonably priced lunch. The salads are always good and the soups are to die for. Unfortunately the nutritional facts have been posted on their website and I freaked myself out. I will be back for less guilty meals.

What in the love do you put on your bacon? Stop by this morning with my daughter a.k.a. foodie in training and we shared a waffle breakfast that came with eggs and bacon. The waffle is really good , the eggs nice and fresh and cooked perfectly. The bacon had a little bit of a sweet hint of maybe brown sugar or something all I know is it was incredibly good. I think you guys found a regular! Yummy!

Im always looking for something outside the chain of restaurants . I placed a to go order on my way home from Costco and had the Pasta Carbanara. THe pasta has peas , panchetta , onions and a creamy sauce . It was so sinful but amazing. I will keep Times Square in mind for my next italian craving .

Andreoli is an incredible find. If your looking for "true" Italian cooking this is the place for you. Some items are a little pricey, but you must realize everything is made with the best ingredients in the highest quality. House made pasta, bread, the best deli meat and cheeses  and baked goods. My favorite is the Caio sandwich , every simple but packed with so much flavor. Next time I will step out of my comfort and order a pasta dish.

I love whole foods. Yes it is pricey , but the quality of what you get is incomparable . So many options for organic produce , a wide variety of fruits , veggies , herbs and much more. I love the fact you can order fish or meat and have them grill it there and you can also have a glass of wine or beer while you're waiting. I wish they had more in the valley , but then again I don't know if phoenix has the demographic to spread out as much as Trader Joes.

If you're looking for "really" good , not greasy Indian food , this is the place for you. I highly recommend Bombay for people who haven't had Indian food and want to give it a try. The food is well priced and as fresh and flavorful as you can get . If they had a Bombay Spice in Old Town, I would eat here every day for lunch.

It's been way too long since I've been to the heart and soul cafe. I've been here for breakfast and dinner and both are exceptional . The breakfast is my favorite. There is a lot of love on the plate no matter what your in the mood for. My all time favorite are the crazy biscuits , biscuits and gravy and chili verde. I know it's nit the best thing for you and probably sounds "crazy" together, but believe me it is the best thing if you are craving a over the top breakfast.

Arrowhead grill is beyond impressive! The bar area is the most popular area to eat. They have an extensive wine list and impressive bar menu. After having a horrible steak dinner at the Phoenician I felt cheated and needed to seek out my craving. I recall seeing emails from arrowhead so I decided to give them a try.  I ordered the bacon wrapped filet and baked potato from the bar menu for 23.99 (19.99 or 15.99 for happy hour). The steak was almost 6-8 oz's steak and I substituted the baked potato for asparagus.  The steak came on a sizzling hot plate with no butter added and the asparagus with a side of béarnaise. Hallelujah , this is what I was looking for . The steak has so much jus and was one of the most tasty I've had in a long time. Asparagus was al' dente and so delicious. I will be a regular here, its unbelievable you can get a killer steak without breaking the bank. Best Kept Secret for sure!

My husband I stayed at the Phoenician for my birthday and the hotel is overall beyond exceptional . I am really disappointed I didn't give J&G a chance (it took 30 minutes just to greet us to order a drink and terrazzo was our second choice.)Il Terrazzos setting is exquisitely romantic , the wine list is better than J&G. I started out with the Potato Chowder , the presentation was fun and the soup was really good. My husband had a caesar, the dressing had the perfect lemon touch, I liked it, but my husband thought it was too salty. We both ordered filets and like they say don't order steak at an Italian Restaurant ;not true, but in this case it was one of the worse steaks I've had. I ordered mine medium and my husband medium rare. The steaks didn't come out as requested, I nibbled on mine but it was too dry to finish and my husband returned his because it was well done. When he cut into the replacement steak there was no jus at all, both of are steaks so dry it wasn't easy to cut through , you just wanted a pound of sauce for moisture. Disappointing for a 42.00 steak and 150.00 check for a disappointing meal. the waiter was really great and made our experience pleasant and we tipped well even though the food was horrible. I think he felt bad and he sent complementary  goat cheese cake and a chocolate torte wine champagne to our room. It was a great way to end the night .. I don't think I will revisit the restaurant, but I do hope they get take a hint and improve the quality.

I dont understand how a second restaurant was opened on Tatum . My husband and gave these place too many chances and wach time the food was not impressive. The margaritas come from a stolen recipe from La Pinata Nueva , but too bad they didnt bring the recipes with them. I hope they get it " that maybe if you put alittle quality in the food people will come back".

My husband I stopped off for a quick lunch because I heard rave reviews about the kale salad. The Hubby doesn't like Kale (or wouldn't choose it ) so we shared a Mediterranean salad and fish tacos. I know they don't go together , but the food was super fresh and delicious and some worked together. We kept looking over at each other sayin "this so yummy" and flawless. The salad had the perfect consistency of crunch and lightness. The Fish in the tacos was moist and flaky and seasons light and just right.  We also had the retail therapy cocktail, it was also delightful, not too sweet and very refreshing and made you want more , but then who would drive us home. I hope to figure out the cocktail recipe to make at home, may need to try a few more first .

I love Ilumina Healing . I started going to Ilumina healing a few years ago to balance out some issues we get as women.  I have to say acupuncture is one of the most relaxing and healing experiences you will ever have in life. It's like a proverbial reset button, that when you're done with your treatment you feel 100% better. The staff at Ilumina healing is well educated in this field and are the best in its class .  I hope to get around to try out the facials.

This place is dangerous ! The food and service was the best I've had since I moved here to phoenix 4 years ago. I can't wait to go back!  We had the fries with Gruyere Cheese served with a side of Mushroom Gravy . The fries could have been a little thinner, but still delicious !  Mac  and Cheese. I can't get enough gruyere, so loved it for that reason.  Skirt Steak - OMG , trolley the best thing I put in my mouth.  It was a portion enough two or three and I highly recommend trying it .  Grilled Peaches with honey , mascarpone and Pecans- I think this is was what made me fall in love , Like the other food on the menu, simple , fresh and innovative with how the ingredients are used. The mascarpone had honey and cinnamon, I am glad I don't live close because I would eat that every day.  YUMMY !

My husband and I have "stay-cations" in scottsdale frequently and the Montelucia is one of our favorite hotels. The rooms are beautiful and the bathroom is one you dream of having at home. Because the location isn't near restaurants, bars, etc, it makes your stay as the perfect getaway from it all. The restaurants and nightlife at the hotel is exquisite . The spa is my #1 in the valley. I remember once starting my day at the spa at 8:00am and didn't leave till 4:00pm. There is so much to take advantage of being a guest at the spa and hotel.

This was my third time at Daily Dose and I have to say each time has been remarkable. The first time I went, I shared the breakfast nachos with a friend and jeez are they dangerously delectable. The nachos along with the bacon Bloody Mary should be a prescription for a hangover.     The next two times I got the Strawberry Mint Salad with Grilled chicken. The balance of Salad , goat cheese and strawberries are perfect. Not overly dressed , but each bite is flavorful and refreshing. I think I found my latest addiction. I will be back soon to get my daily dose.

I've been to Postinos in Arcadia several times and I always seem to forget how wonderful the food is. Last night was my first time at the Central location. I loved the atmosphere. It was comfortable, elegant and was a great space to hang out with hipsters. We ordered our usual Bruchetta and the mediterranean  salad. The salad was so amazing , I wish I new how to make the dressing.  I have had every Bruchetta they make and there isn't one I don't like. I hope it isn't too long before we go back again. It amazing how something so simple can taste so amazing.

Norterra Nail and Spa is the best place for a haircut, Mani -Pedi and Waxing.  It's the only place I will go to in the area for a mani- pedi . Everyone is professional and have high standards when it comes to cleanliness.  Plus you can enjoy a glass of wine during your service. I know this sounds like an expensive place, but its only dollars more than your typical salon and its worth the try.

Cartwrights is a nice getaway restaurant that has a whole lot of Southwestern / Romantic Ambiance. Its sits in the heart of the neat western town of Cave Creek and is a hidden gem if you ask me . The Prices are moderate , in fact I think the steaks are better than most Hoity Toity Steak houses , plus you get two sides and choice of sauces. The wine and cocktail list is excellent . It's an institution for us when we have family in town. Plenty of options for everyone and you will not be disappointed. My most favorite is the lobster, its prepared to easily eat and served with a beautiful Beurre Blanc. Highly recommended !

I ordered take out the other night through the online ordering. The ordering system was seamless and user friendly. When i came in the staff was extremely accommodating and they wanted to ensure my order was precise before leaving. I ordered the Chicken Bryan which was perfectly cooked even after the 20 minute commute home.  My meal was delish, then again anything with Goat Cheese is a hit in my book. I also ordered a shrimp special that was served in parchment paper. The paper kept flaking on to the food, but the taste was good , but it was a pain to eat around. I do plan to try other things here.

I happen to like modern Mexican and have been to Revo's twice and both times had the Carne Asada tacos. The food is really good and inexpensive for great quality. I like they have whole wheat tortilla as an option. I will go here over chipotle any day. I plan to come back soon and try something new.

Delish ! My Hubby was on a mission to find the best rum drink and I remembered Hula's making a delicious drink called "the painkiller" at Devoured. The drink was just as good , if not better , it will knock your socks off if you have too many , but the taste is so delicious that you better have a cab driver on speed dial . We shared fish bites for an appetizer, the fish was extremely fresh and lighter than expected. I hope to make it back to try other menu items.

Beer selection is amazing ! You can get any type of craft american and local brews.  Thick pizza and baked wings aren't my thing. I have indulged in a few slices soak up the beer  , no regrets , but I mostly come here for the beer.

Luu's is a must try if you have a teriyaki craving . I ordered a teriyaki bowl with chicken breast . Everything was so fresh considering how fast it was to make it . I will for sure stop by the next time I need a quick bite in that neighborhood .

I cant believe it took me along to give Cidermill a review. I order lunch delivery from Cider Mill at least once a week. I have tried many things on the menu and never felt dissappointed. The quaility of the food is so fresh and well thought out. I highly recommend the Nay's Milly Philly  Or Tom's Tuna with the bread toasted

What a sweet little find! Stopped off to check out something new. The menu was really impressive and I shared the Pro Pasto. It was really good, but i wish the platter had more cheese. I also wish I wasn't Prego that night so; I could indulge with a glass of wine with the appetizer. The beer, wine and cocktail list looks amazing. My husband had a rum drink that he absolutely loved.

Well Fox Concepts has done it again! I went for my second time with my husband for lunch . I had yesterdays soup , Minestrone soup with Italian sausage and he had the Cheeseburger.  The Cheeseburger was the best i ever had , it topped Flemming's cheeseburger, if you could imagine. The fries are thin cut and perfectly seasoned , not too salty. The soup , oh man, had roasted veggies and the perfect amount of fresh northern beans and lil Italian sausage meatballs. I am for sure going to figure out how to master the recipe.

I'm addicted to the simple bean and cheese burritos, homemade, no crap in them and everything a bean and cheesier should be. I need to wean myself from having too many, I don't want to get sick of them ...savor the love. I've had the carne Asada and Pastor Taco's both are ridiculously yummy as well.

Having the 'Hearty Breakfast' special and its amazing!! My husband had the yogurt parfait and he said it was like having desert for breakfast even though nutritionally it was probably better than mine. Service was great and was surprised to see how empty it was on a holiday weekend Friday morning but most people likely didn't get the day off. Yummy yummy!!

I was really impressed when we contact First Option lending, they came to our house and walked through every piece of paperwork we signed for the loan application. I got a good vibe from the first line of communication. Soon after that no communication at all. This process began back in November and we are still chasing after them for status. On average , it takes a week to get a call back from our loan officer.  It's funny because, we are currently refinancing our rental home from a different company and the level of service has been exceptional, they send us updates to keep us in the loop constantly.  We are canceling our loan application with first option today and going with the other company.

I come here for lunch and I loved it ! I am bummed that they dont deliver to the local businesses , because i would order more than once a week, infact all of my co-workers love it . The food is fresh , its not your typical greasy , salty mexican. The chips and Salsa are good , the tacos are so addicting too.

Devoured Phoenix was extraordinary! It was my first time here and I will continue to attend every year. The best thing about this event is they represented the support of Arizona local restaurants and also promoted local produce and goods. Its hard for me to pin point what i loved best because all of the participants cooked their asses off and everything was incredible. The choices of beer and wine was over the top, you cant beat the set up. Good Job and See you next year!

The Owner and Employees are nice people, but there is definitely an advantage for City Market 2 being located in a corporate building because they can charge ridiculous prices for the convenience. I try to avoid ordering from them as much as possible. This morning I ordered an Americano (1 shot espresso and water) and a cheese Danish and it was 5.50. The Danish was a few days old because it was hard as a brick and was uneatable. I will seriously never, ever order for them again.

I went to Wild Vines with my girlfriends for drinks and dinner in celebration a girl's night. When we walked in there was probably 10 customers and one bartender. We had been greeted by the bartender immediately and water and menus followed 20 Minutes later. We ordered a round of drinks, the cheese platter and hummus appetizer. All items were good, but from that point on the night went south . No one came back for a second round of drinks or anything else until a new server started about 30 minutes later.  We finally placed our dinner orders,  shrimp skewers , Ahi salads, flat bread , shrimp pasta and chicken kabobs. The Ahi salad was $18.00 and foul in every way; the smell , the wilted lettuce, canned Chinese rice noodle sticks and Kraft bottled dressing; the most disgusting salad I have ever tasted.  The shrimp kabobs never came, but some creamy shrimp with a wilted salad came. The flat bread pizza was just thrown on a plate (piled on) it looked previously prepared and the chicken skewers never made it, my friend was so over the crappy service , she was about to go next door to sonic. The pasta; everything was edible but the shrimp.  When we sent everything back, the waiter made an excuse that everyone working today was new (including himself) and that they've had nothing but problems with the new chef. The bartender came by and took our plates to show the owner the food that came out, since she has had issues with the new chef as well and wanted him to see for himself. We ordered a grilled cheese and wedge salad to replace the Ahi salad and all I can say it was untouched as well.  After we asked to talk to the manager the waiter came back apologized and dropped a round of drinks from our bill to compensate. We weren't expecting more, but felt the owner should know how bad everything is, because it is his restaurant and you want repeat business. It seemed like the owner was hiding, avoiding to talk to us because he took forever to come to our table. The bartender came by and told us she was paying for our dinner on her dime because she felt so bad and we insisted that she bill us something so we can tip her since the situation with the chef was out of her control. She took each of our cards to put $8.00 in so we can each tip at least $10.00 . The Owner finally came to our table and apologized and said he suggested to pay for the bill (means the bartender lied to us) and appreciated our patience in a very relaxed attitude and gave us is own story of coming in because he was called in that he was needed and had to leave home sick to be there. #1 : why would any of you show your dirty laundry and throw your own staff under the bus. #2 why wouldn't you be so carefree to not compassionately care about your food, your staff, your service. I've said enough and review is may seem already winded , but I'm curious to see just how long it will take for this business to shut down. I felt like I was being filmed on Kitchen Nightmares. Gordon Ramsey would have a field day with this one. I don't even want to see their kitchen because I would probably throw up. Bummed that I have to give them one star.

A Real French Creperie ...Finally! I think Chez Vous has the best Crepes and Croque Monsieur. I've only been a couple of times, but everytime I've gone, I'm doing I love what im eating dance. Anything with good Béchamel makes me dance.  Its a little pricy for crepes and sandwiches, but sometimes that's what you pay for quaility food. Cant wait for my next visit.

I can't believe it took me this long to come to Los Taquitos. The street style tacos are really good, maybe a little spicy for some but that's the way I like it. I want to come back and have a margarita and maybe try something new.

I had brunch hear to start with a couple of months ago and boy was I impressed. I had the Crouque Madame , the bread was crunchy and stuffed with lots of ham and bubbling  gruyere cheese served in a piping hot cast iron skillet. It was a bit heavy, but its a must try. I do suggest sharing. My husband had the burger, he said it was in his top 5....pretty darn close to a Fleming's  burger. The burger was served on a toasted brioche bun and was perfectly seasoned. The burger came with fresh cut bistro frites or fries. Ketchup isn't nesassary. The all you can drink mimosas and food was so yummy we can't wait to take more people.

I love the Herb Box. My company previously ordered catering from the North Scottsdale location and that's when the addiction began. You would have to fight off coworkers for left over's. The food is always fresh and delish!  The ingredients are perfectly placed and you know what your getting is prepared with love . There isn't anything on the menu I don't like.  I am here at least 2 times a week for lunch, I keep checking the desserts for the peach and cream tart . Peach season is coming soon , so expect me lurking the whole month of May.

Woowza!!!! I've been here five times and I can't believe it's taken this long to "yelp" them. Tonight was the kicker! I ordered the veggie pizza and added pepperoni, plus a caesar salad with chicken. What got my heart (which everyone other items on their menu has, but not like this) veggie pizza and added pepperoni. The veggies are so fresh . The artichoke hearts are smokey and the perfect blend of the veggies, touched with the perfect amount (not too much) pesto. I'm not the biggest fan of Caesars, but my hubby really loved the dressing and the freshness of the salad and best of all fresh grilled warm chicken. We will be regulars on a weekly basis for sure. The prices are in expensive for the quality of food too.

My husband and I went the Arrogant Butcher before the stevie Nicks Concert and the restaurant was packed with a two hour wait. There were a few seats at the bar near the kitchen but we decided to wait and come back after the concert. Fortuntely , we left the concert a little early and was able to score a patio seat. We ordered the Turkey Sloppy Joe and side Tabbouleh salad to share. I almost which i had mine own because both where so good. The sloppy joe was so yummy it inspired me to make my own at home. I cant wait to go back and try other items on the menu. To Be Continued ...

I really hope that this restaurant pulls it together. There website says they open next week and there is no menu. I work across the street and walked over to scope out the menu , because we are always looking for new places for lunch.  The location is the perfect opporunity for a cafe to grab a meal and relax. The menu is small, which is a good start for a new restaurant.  They had two salad's that the mistily didn't put prices on the menu. I showed up this morning around 8:30 AM to try a latte and grab a muffin. The pastry "chef" hasn't come in and all they had was old muffins from three days ago.  I decided to give it a go anyway and hoped for something to bring me back. The latte was yummy and the muffin wasn't too bad for being wrapped in plastic for three days.  I typicllay give starting restaurants a third chance, hopefully my next experience is better. Anyone can own a restaurant , the challenge is keeping it open.

I can't say enough good things about Windsor! If I lived up the street I would be a regular twice a day. I decided to show up for brunch this time. They have the coolest Bloody Mary Bar with all the accompaniments from , fresh grated horseradish, horseradish sauce , pickled everything , onions, different hot sauces. You have a choice between Red or Green Bloody Mary drinks. The Red is traditional with a little kick and Green reminds me of Sofrito for some reason. I really wish I knew the best way to garnish the Green Bloody Mary. I had the Eggs Benedict, the sauce ham and poach egg was perfect. I wish the English muffin and a little crisp to it , but it was still really good.

Oh my sweet heaven. I have been here twice a week in the last month since this review. I have been addicted to the strawberry muffins back fresh daily.  The muffin is almost in a light biscuit batter, I can't describe it well because it's really hard to figure out, since its dense in texture , but the taste is like a really good biscuit .  I also had the crepe with goat cheese, Spinach, Tomato and an egg, its ridiculous how good this is. I want to try more , but I always have to battle my craving for the strawberry muffin.

I just strolled in to see if I could find something for my semi sweet tooth (sweet and savory is more my style) and what a perfect place to get your fix . They have premade salads that looked like they had been made a few minutes prior , sandwiches, other items . The pastry bar was impressive , the cupcakes looked beautiful and everything looked so inviting .  I ordered a fresh squeezed lemonade and a lemon poppy seed Madeline , both were perfect for my fix. I will be back for lunch.   Stay tuned...

Yum  Yum and Yum ! Churn makes you feel like your in a old-fashioned ice cream shop with all the sweet treats and the perfect variety of ice cream flavors. I always need to sneak by for a taste test after having dinner at Windsor . I finally had my first full cone of Strawberry Ice Cream on a pretzel cone. My concept sounded good because I love the salty sweet combo , but the cone was too salty for the strawberry. I think a chocolate or peanut butter would be better. The Strawberry Ice Cream was fresh and the perfect consistency , but too rich and had the perfect balance of sweetness.

Best darn Mediterranean food I've had in a long time. My favorite is the Chicken Kabob's and also a Fatoosh salad . I mix the salad with the rice and chicken and the combination is so amazing . I make a similar salad at home , it's so addicting that I highly recommend trying the two together. My husband loves the lettuce wraps , I don't know why but it reminds me of tacos, I like this too , but I feel incomplete if I don't order my usual.

The Food Truck Festival was awful I wish got my time and money back.  I should up around 6:00 pm and the parking lot was packed. I broke my leg 8 weeks ago and it was hard for me to maneuver through all the rock and plug in wires. In two hours I was only able to three trucks, beetit, torched goddess and a barbecue truck. The creme brûlée was amazing, but I would rather deal with the crazy people scavenging for samples at Costco. We left earlier than we expected since most of the lines were fifty deep and headed to Postinos and had an amazing dinner. I rather go check out the good trucks in a different setting. Good Concept though.

Lunche Libre ! You now found a new stalker ! I was fortunate enough to live near two schools they stopped off at the past two weeks. Both times I had the Steak and Blue quesadilla. The Carne Asada was delicious and the combination of everything in it was perfect. I've had the Aqua Frescas in the past and they are a must.

I just stopped off for lunch last week. I order tacos from their "sushi style" Taco card. I was the Coolest concept to order taco's like you order sushi rolls. I ordered a flank steak taco with a Jalapeño stuffed with cheese and a Fish Taco . The tacos had been delivered in my to go bag as if I picked them up from a nice taco cart and the flavor was outrageously good. So much flavor, with homemade and fresh ingredients, it was definitely made with love. I cant wait to go back and try more.

From the outside it looks like a fast food Chinese place because of the logo, but don't make that stop you from giving HK Asian Cuisine a try. My first attempt was a friend had ordered take out, Orange chicken and Mongolian beef with fried rice. I loved all of it but the orange chicken really stood out for me. The Orange Chicken was REALLY,  REALLY good. I think their Orange Chicken is better than PF Chang's.. I've ordered take out twice since my friend introduced me and I plan to be a regular. I wish they delivered.

I went to Davanti on a lunch break with work friends and we were all amazed at the beautiful atmosphere.  The restaurant is situated in a isolated (not so odd , but that area doesn't get that busy) section of the plaza , but if people gave this place a chance they would find a beautiful gem. Yes the atmosphere is that inviting and the food is just the kicker. I had the Porchetta Panini, it was juicy inside and the bread perfectly crispy.  The French fries are fresh and highly addicting. I cant wait to go back and try items. I think I will stop in for dinner next time .

Chelsea's kitchen is one or stops on our way home from the airport and its worth the detour for us . The food is always fresh and over the top delicious ! Weve had the burgers , nachos , every taco on the menu, short ribs , breakfast... I've been there so much it's a shame that it took me this long to write a review. A couple of  pluses to note : 1) children eat for free before 7 PM and the children's menu is pretty impressive and not your typical fried nasty kids meal. 2) Pick up a free chocolate chip cookie with a hint of Fluer De Sel.

Fries are delish ! I had the classic burger and i asked for it with out ketchup, but it came with it anyway. The burger tasted good and it was for sure as fresh as your going to get. It was overloaded with condiments that the burger fell apart and i gave up after two bites. Everyone has there burger preference , but this was not mine. I wont deduct stars because Jimmy's should be given a chance because i can tell there is a whole lot of heart on what they do.

The Scavenger Hunt was such a great way to start the Christmas season and discover new local shops . The weather was perfect, there are so many neat places in old town that I never knew existed, I couldn't ask for a better day. It's dangerous for me to work up the road from old town,  because there several places I want to revisit and do some damage to my wallet. Baratin is on my list of spots to check out. Shop Local!!!! Thank you once again Lindsey!

I thinking I'm going to pick up dinner from the Chop Shop tonight. I stopped in for lunch last week and ordered a bbq chicken salad , who knew a salad could be this fun and delicious . It had the best ratios of every ingredient and my most favorite bite was with little crunchy corn bits (almost like corn cuts) . I highly recommend checking the chop shop out if you're looking for something new to try.

I am so excited that humble pie opened in my neighborhood. Most of the local restaurants are franchises and it's nice to have a local restaurant with quality food. We showed up day four of opening and the service wasn't the best, but it was this first week and you can't expect exceptional service at that time. The food was killer though. We shared a pizza and Caesar salad. Their Caesar is one of my favorites.  I went there for lunch last week and the food was exceptional. Lunch specials are the way to go; chopped salad and  1/2 a BLT. The BLT was no joke, almost a whole sandwich and perfectly made. The Chopped just the way a chopped salad should be, chopped small , nice and delicate with a light vinaigrette.

Tried this for the first time with hubby, new baby and our friend from out of town and it was a unanimously amazing experience. Our server Alex was awesome - case in point - when told it was our first time in, he asked us to put the menus down and began a great presentation of all the menu items and what their best known for. We took his advice and got the briscuit, the bootlegger burger, a Sunday special Bloody Mary and the bacon appetizer plate.   All items were 5-star good and the burger was actually fought over. The Bloody Mary was a meal in an of itself as a slider burger came as the garnish. Again, ALEX the host, came through and gave us some of their desert moonshine as samples which led us to order their peach cobbler and chocolate bacon raspberry cake.   After all of this we had to be rolled out of there but not without smiles on our faces and plans to come back next Sunday and the one after that.   Kudos to a new amazing restaurant experience that will certainly be a staple on our dining list.

The food is mediocre and unfortunately there aren't a lot of options in town. Everytime my husband and I go there the service is bad and  the food is majority of the time cold because its been sitting for awhile.  I went in this morning and it will for sure be my last time at any good egg. I sat at the bar for 20 minutes. Four waiters passed by me and  smiled, not a "someone will be with you" nothing. I was about to walk up to who appeared to be a manager (who also passed me a few times) , but I decided to leave because there was already a precedence to having a bad experience. It wasn't till I got up and left when a waiter asked if I was ok. I snapped because I was starving and pregnant and I feel bad, but that place deserves no business of mine. I'm done!!!!

Working with Jason was a breath of fresh air . The professionalism and integrity of what the business provides is second to none. We had an arched door that needed replacing due to water damage and I got just what we needed at a reasonable price . When the installation was happening , the installers took the time to perfect in the framing and alignment , no damage to anything surrounding the door . The guys had to work around heavy duty security gate and I'm sure t wasn't easy. The door is beautiful and I couldn't be more happy with the end result .

I heard so much about Pasty's and I've been on hiatus eating out since I've had my little one , but now that im back at work ... so BRING IT ! I ordered the Italian Pasty which has Pepperoni, salami, capocollo, ham, mozzarella, fresh basil, and roasted tomatoes.  I never had a pasty in my life and oh man have I missed out . The crust was buttery , yet a little light (  ) and flakey and the layers if the inside was more than perfection . I ate  1/2 and was expecting to revisit the other half for dinner and that didn't work out so well. I cant wait to go back and try others.

Im always looking for a quick bite to eat on the way into work. I have a picky palette and always end up at the trendy spots. I read that The Henry opened and decided to stop in on the way in to the office. First off , the people that work in the commercial building are so lucky to have a cool lunch spot to go to . The restaurant is beautiful like something you would see in Elle Décor. You just want to spend half of your day there it looks so inviting. The Staff is so friendly and attentive to you likes and made you feel at home. Now to the food , I ordered the breakfast sandwich (minus mayo) and it was built on a fresh brioche bun . The bun was not too thick and had the perfect layer of egg , bacon , cheddar and avocado. Simple, but delicious ! I will be a regular guaranteed .

I will be back. Tonight was my first time here. I was with my 11 month old daughter (foodie in training) so we couldn't take advantage of the hibachi grill , which I thought would be fun. I did order steak and chicken Teppanaki (sp?) and it was hands down better than Benihana , Sapporo or any other I've been to. The food was so flavorful without being overly dressed with butter . The sushi looked yummy and the service was incredible. I will be back with a bigger crowd besides my side kick foodie in training.

Boy am I glad that I checked this out. First off , the restaurant is immaculate and very well organized. You can find everything from soups made fresh daily, Mexican sweet breads, paletas (Ice Cream ) , Aqua Frescas, elote, tacos, burritos, tortas. I ordered the  Asada tacos and my one year-old foodie in training ordered the kids bean and cheese burrito. The Asada tacos had some fat that i had to pick through , but the tacos (maybe because its rib eye) are made with fresh tortillas and are flavorful. The bean and cheese burrito was a little spicy for a baby, but it was good to me. The kids meal came with aqua fresca and I ordered the cucumber flavor which was refreshing and not overly sweet.  I will give it another go when in the area and try something new and hopefully better.
