So I ventured here while I was downtown for jury duty. To celebrate a mistrial, I decided to treat myself to a gyro.  Athenian Express is not in the middle of the "hustle and bustle" of downtown (although "hustle and bustle" doesn't really apply to anywhere in metro Phoenix), so it was kind of a schlep getting to. But oh was it worth it.  The menu is all over the place, with handwritten modifications actually printed on the big board above the register, but it's your standard Greek lunch fare-- i.e. gyros, sandwiches, salads. I got the feta gyro. It came with traditional shaved gyro meat, tomato, red onion and feta on a warm pita bread. And holy feta was it good! Be prepared for the feta because there was an s-ton of it, along with perhaps too many red onions but they're easy to pick off. Along with the homemade tzatziki sauce that I got to put on myself (a plus), it was a great lunch.   I didn't want to give it too many stars because 1. my side of potato salad was room temperature and scary and 2. to be fair, I have to try more than one menu item. Next time, i'll go for the falafel. And, mark my words, there will be a next time!

The pupusas here are as good as the ones I got on the side of the road in El Tunco, El Salvador last summer. The only difference is those cost me 25 cents each while these are 20 times that. I guess that's what happens when you have to pass American health codes...

Just cashed in our groupons for these bad boys a few weeks ago and had a great time, even if it did mean getting up before 8 a.m. on a Sunday. The staging site near 4 Peaks was easy to find and the company provided all the gear we'd need-- helmets, goggles, water, confidence, you name it. Luckily it had just rained the night before so instead of dust flying everywhere, we got splashed with mud. I'd rather get muddy and have some great views of the Valley sans pollution than ride through a constant cloud of dust, a la Pigpen.  The guide was super experienced and he let some of the faster riders up towards the front and the slower riders in the back so people could go at their own pace. We of course managed to get squashed in the middle behind a couple who couldn't decide whether they wanted to be speed racers or terrified school girls. That kinda put the kibosh on us really letting loose, but we still managed to pick up some speed along the way and really enjoy the trail. Since we weren't allowed to bring anything with us, the guide provided water and even took our pictures so we could download them later.   All in all, I'd definitely recommend Stellar Adventures if you're looking for a little half-day trip or want to treat some out-of-town guests. It's a little pricey though, even with the groupons, but worth the splurge if you're up for a little action.

The only items worth getting here are the pollo blanco enchiladas, the chimichanga or the mexican pizza. The trifecta will not disappoint. If you order anything else, don't come complaining to me!

This place is trying way too hard. It's a teeny place in a strip mall-- they shouldn't be charging that much for a so-so wine selection and, honestly, food that's severely lacking in flavor. Puh-lease.  It's pretty obvious Spitfire's focus is on its organic meat selection. Apparently their cows get weekly spa visits and are raised on a diet of strawberry yogurt and rainbows. For someone who doesn't really eat red meat, this meant nada to me. Their other options were extremely limited so I settled on the mushroom pizza. I couldn't finish it and didn't want to take the rest home. Now, I basically live off left-overs, they are down-right holy to me, so that's saying something.

BLD has the potential to be something awesome and I definitely plan on sticking around to see if it can get there. I'm giving it a half-star extra cause I can tell it's trying really, really hard, it just has a few more kinks to work out.   I went around 11:30 so we were able to sample both the breakfast and lunch menus. I had to get the mac n' cheese because, well, OBVI. It was pretty good, if not a bit too suspiciously creamy. Listen, I like Velveeta as much as the next drunk college student but if you're gonna charge me $6 it had better be homemade, with some extra TLC thrown in for good measure. I also had the proscuitto salad, which was decent with yummy proscuitto, melon, strawberries, cashews and a fried goatcheese ball I had to guard very carefully from jealous fellow diners. My only complaint was that it was super salty rather than a nice balance of sweet and salty. Maybe try unsalted cashews?? Washed it all down with a pretty delish mimosa (what?? mimosas aren't just for breakfast!)  My date got breakfast-- the pork verde chili tostada. The few bites I had were yummy but as he said, it wasn't anything exciting or unexpected. Basically just a mexican spin on breakfast food.   All around, I dug the vibe of BLD and once they grow a bit older and wiser, I'll accept their offer for a second date.

OHSO?  More like NO SO. Stuffy atmosphere, less than exciting menu, and waitress had no idea what she was talking about. This is a micro brewery: your staff should at least know what a beer tastes like, not just vodka cranberrys out of a red cup! Plus she got the order wrong three times and offered a sample of beer I was unsure about and proceeded to charge me for the flipping sample, without mentioning it. Not cool

This place has improved tremendously since  my initial terrible review (though I do still like to call it NO SOH). Great beer selection and really stellar fish and chips. Only downside is I have yet to try their back patio because it's too popular- an hour and a half wait?! Ha. Ha.
