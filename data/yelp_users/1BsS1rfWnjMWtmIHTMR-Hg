Never going to any Hooters again. 1) Flat Ass everywhere. Eat some of the wings and do some squats. 2) They increased the price of the endless wings for the new year yet the wings got smaller. The manager said that it is because they are being charged more. They might want to think about changing suppliers then. 3) To charge for every ranch dressing is asinine. We asked for one ranch each and she brought us a ranch every time we got our next plate of six tiny wings. Never did our server Ashlea tell us we were going to have to pay for each ranch that we did not even ask for. At least the beer was good and at a decent price. I think we will stick to Zipps!

One of the best omelets I have had in a long time. The Italian was felled with goodness. Owner was really friendly. If you call ahead they will have your order ready.

My biggest complainant is it is a bit expensive. average price for a plate of vegetables is $18. Don't get me wrong it taste great but come on.

This place is great. I can't believe it's not packed or that we have not discovered it sooner. $10 gets you a flight and a free pint glass to take home. All their beers are smooth and full of flavor. The staff is friendly, informative, and passionate about what they do. Love how close it is to my house and that you can bring in your own food. Can never go wrong with a good beer and can't wait to bring in my friends.

This was our first time here so we didn't know what to expect. If you are familiar with the famous Macy's in Flagstaff it is a similar vibe and setup with a modern twist. We have never had a savory crepe and they were well worth the somewhat expensive price. They start you off with some granola and you finish with a little mike a brownie bit. Highly recommend this place even if it just for the great coffee. We tried the Chipotle, Smoked Turkey, and a first timer. Way to much food but we wanted to try savory and sweet.
