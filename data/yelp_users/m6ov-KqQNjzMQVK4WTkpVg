Perfect example of a group of people so desperate for Chinese food that they actually eat here and rate this place above a 1 star.   REALLY PEOPLE?!?!? Explore the world some and learn what good Chinese food is.   The place is filthy. From the floors to the seats to the tables to the doors to the walls. You are welcomed with the over powering smell of what the...is that the smell of food poisoning??? There is grease in the air. This place is just nasty.   The crab puffs were nasty and they serve you the dipping sauces in a plastic container for one person yet you have 6 puffs to share with 4 people.   They have no alternatives to soda other than water. No milk. No juice. They apparently ran out of ice tea....WHAT THE???? Tea is 90% of your business.   Let's see they also served the appetizers after the entrees and by the time I got the plastic cups of sauce the puffs were cold.   The meat was animal grade quality grizzle and fat in the beef. Chicken was hacked up with tendons and ligaments. Steamed veggies were steamed to goo. Fried meats were soggy.   The only thing that was good was the water...perhaps it was the slight taste of tap water chlorine that made it refreshing...it certainly was the cleanest thing in this restaurant.   Go somewhere else people!!!! I'm going home to  shower and vomit!

For seafood there is a lot to be desired! This place is all about the ambiance only if you survive the walk down the 120 degree cedar staircase.   First, if one calls for reservations and one specifies that they have more than one child in the group one would that the first thing out of the hostesses mouth would be a polite warning about the non-kid friendly atmosphere solely for the discretion of the reserver. But NNNOOOOOO way...this  greedy establishment wants any dollar they can get since the quality is not worthy.   No high chairs, no kids cups, nothing in plastic, or paper to go bowls, no kids menus. NADA!  Then comes the seafood and steaks. Seafood was so bland it might have just crawled out of the ocean and plopped itself on the frying pan. Sad indeed for a seafood restaurant that should be better than the rest.    The filet was ordered medium but cooked all the way through since the chef opted to butterfly it to save time in hopes of rushing to the next customer and the pressing it to the grill ensured that there was no juices remaining and the char from the grill was the only flavor disguised as steak rub.   My recommendation...dead lobster for seafood and outback for steak and you would be a happier customer than of you dined at this anti-child establishment.

Holy effing effing eff eff. What the eff is wrong with the mother effing employees that work at this effing company.   Arrived May 20, 2015 to JW Marriott Desert Ridge Scottsdale AZ. Had an issue with the reservation. Called the platinum line....    That is right...I am Platinum Elite Lifetime. That means I spend 155+ nights at pathetic Marriot's all over the country every year for 10+ years...at the average of $250 per night I have easily spent over $500,000 just for rooms not including food, drinks, tips, parking and incidentals. Plus I make all my teams stay at the same location. That is right....easily tens of millions generated. So I have expectations. I am a travel expert. I digress.   ...Asked the platinum line to help straighten out the reservation. Well blah blah blah holiday weekend...blah blah blah..fees...blah blah blah. She wasn't entitled to provide customer service at the level she wanted. Had to transfer me to Customer Service. Asked her to confirm the room before the transfer. Well that was an inconvenience to her and she didn't want to do it and she transferred me to customer service. And that lady was attempting to be even more of a pain in the effing a$$. My recommendation. Fire them all and hire and retrain. Mr Marriott your reps have become complacent.   Well while the CSR was busy not helping me putting me on hold and blah blah blah holiday weekend blah blah blah fees blah blah blah...oh let me remind you of my status and level of commitment to your company. Oh an I was on vacation with my wife and 2 toddlers that were so excited for the hotel and the bags were unloaded and the car was inconveniently parked no where close to the lobby.    In the mean time I walk up to the high school drop out running the counter and here he goes with the blah blah blah holiday weekend blah blah blah fees blah blah blah sold out. So insert status yet again and explain how the error occurred from the Marriott employees booking agent. His lack of interest in resolving the problem was beyond unbelievable. A-hole. Had to ask him to call the other hotel where he had to call some connecting line. In the meantime I call the other hotel get them to correct the error which the extremely helpful lady totally understood. So back to the diptard...blah blah blah sold out. Blah blah blah platinum override. Blah blah blah explained the other lady that was holding the room. Blah blah blah rack rate...you tardo. I am on a points stay!!!! Exerting my hard earned status. So tardo could not book the room.   Meantime I am on my phone app pull up the effing hotel with all the effing losers working to support it and I book my own room and hand the confirmation over to Mr holiday sold out one room rack rate diptard. So I am in with the family finally...saved the vacation!!!  Do you think I got a room upgrade? No. Do you think I was serviced appropriately? No. Do you think I had to work harder than necessary to correct an error that was not my fault? Yep. Do you think anyone here got a tip? Nope. Do you think anyone will get a tip when the pathetic marriott staff set the tone for the vacation? Nope. Do you think I peed in the pools??? Yes...every chance I got. And the hot tubs???? Positively!!!!! Every chance I get.   I hate that this company doesn't show some respect or loyalty to their elite members. I really hate that JW Marriott doesn't have an ounce of class to treat his elite member well. I really hate that JW Marriott can't train his people or his franchisees on true customer service. Seems like JW Marriott is just out to treat customers like crap and suck the money and adventure out of people.   I have to go pee again...drinking way to much in this hot sun keeps me going and going and going and going.   On to day 4 at the JW Marriott Desert Ridge Scottsdale AZ...should have stayed at a Starwood property instead!!!  Did I mention that this hotel is too cheap to even supply queen beds in the rooms...the last time my wife and I had to share a double was in college while the kids shared a double in a room that could hold 2 kings easily and then some. But they sure a save on the sheets and the laundry!!! Way to live up to the JW reputation like a Courtyard would.

SO DON'T GO TO THIS PLACE IN JUNE, JULY OR AUGUST...well any other time too!! I know...I was here on June 26, 2015. The other months will get worse.   The fact that they sat me in a loud room next to the bar under the TV when I requested a quieter area for a meeting I was about to have did not trigger thoughts of a Yelp review.   The fact that they did not have the tables ready for our group that we reserved weeks in advance did not illicit a yelp review.   The fact that they are housed within some sort of cell proof bunker did not trigger thoughts of yelp reviews until my kids were having problems and trying to get help. But when I was on hold getting help for the kids the scheißekopf playing his umpaloomp tuba right behind my head while I was holding on the phone waiting for my drink triggered thoughts of standing up knocking him on his fat rump and beating him with his shiny tootdalou.   The fact that the food was not as good as I anticipated definitely triggered the need for a Yelp review. But I was having fun. I was having my meeting and I didn't have time for that yelping stuff.   But at the middle of the meal when the entire room heated up to about 90+ degrees and everyone at the table was complaining about the heat sweating to death and das fräulein mentions the AC was as cool as it goes and I lost all my appetite because I was getting sick from the heat is the final moment when I had it with this place.   Do you want good German food...check out the places in Mesa. There are several. They are authentic. They have better food. They have better atmospheres. They have ACs. And they don't have a scheißekopf on a tuba being rude to their patrons.   Just say NEIN to this pathetic place...I was there...I know for a fact!!!

Alway a great steak here!  Gotta come check out the Valentines Day weekend special...bread, appetizer, 2 steaks, 2 salads, 2 sides and a cheesecake all for under $50!!!  Definitely pick an upgrade!  They make the best steaks...better than any of the steak chains by far and not as pricey!  Hubby was in Heaven and I was stuffed...kids always love the dessert! It is always a g'day down-under mates!

When you have starving children and they refuse to eat the PB&J...you know your PB&J is messed up! When the kids refuse to eat the sugar free whipped cream it really upsets the kids because they had expectations. At least have the courtesy to warn the parents or offer the sloppy sticky drizzle on the side and to leave the nasty cream in the kitchen.   P.S. Four napkins won't cut it in that situation either.

Hit this place up June 13, 2015. 9 AM  Well to start the food is always good here so that is why we come. They treat the kids well. Free samples. Free kids cookie. But then something happens making me question why we come here...  Someone needs to use the restroom. If you ever have the need preparers be disgusted. These are some of the nasties restrooms in the in industry. The floors are covered in grease, they smell, they look like they are never professionally cleaned. Check out the partially alive cock roach laying on the floor. Then you have to touch the soap dispenser and the handles and the towel dispenser.   Sure few people wash their hands thoroughly for 2-3 minutes with soap in hot water but most people don't use enough soap and clearly don't rinse for 2 minutes and the rest of the people, kids included, leave the piss and crap on their hands...and all that leave this room with the cooks, wait staff, hostesses, dishwashers, etc. fecal matter EVERYWHERE because everyone has to touch all that stuff.   Back to the ROACH...well if there is 1 there is at least 1000. If their germs aren't enough then think of all that poison that is needs to partially kill this one. It has to be all over this establishment. Picture to prove it...check it out.   Someone needs to call the health inspector and they should bring the roach patrol. This place is nasty.

Let's start with the appetizer. Everyone must try the Gold Wings!!! Delicious!!!!  Next we move to the salads for 4. Whoa they are HUGE!!!! Quite a tasty salad as well!!! Plenty to share.   Then there is the pizza. So many different combos of flavors.  I have tried them all and cannot complain about any of them. They are like music to my ears and happiness to my stomach. They give kids their own doh to play with. The tropical tea is abundant  Bring a sweater...they like to keep it about 60 degrees in here.   If you live at the Vive...stay away. The businesses here don't need your cars flooding the lots here too. I bet the Vivers are the ones requesting all the giant boulders to block the parking for anyone not driving a Prius.

COCKROACHES!!!!  Ick Ick ick!!!  Do not know why I liked this place so much before. Check out the health ratings on this place. They have this complete cycle of bad reviews over and over and over. Won't ever go back!!!  BLD...well  It is best for breakfast!!!! Lunch is ok. I'd skip the dinner.   Fresh squeezed juice takes so long it is like they picked the oranges right from the trees. But I'd still eat here.   Mmmm dogs, dog pee and flies...that sums up the patio. Wonder if they ever hose the place down. Oh the flies. But id still eat here.   Eating inside...well all those flies come in too. But I'd still eat here.   Food is very over priced....but it is so delicious. I'd still eat here.   But one thing is for sure...if you live across the street at the Vive...keep your dogs and your cars at home. We don't want any of that over here at the BLD!

Doesn't even deserve one star. This is the worst Pho In the country. Horrible. Bad food. Bad service. Appetizers came out after entrees and even after complaining they did. Itching about it. Cold Pho. Barely any chicken. Nasty flavor. Dirty restaurant. Store dirty dishes next to the bathrooms. Hot and cold kitchen don't talk.  WHAT???? The restaurant is all of 15 feet wide. On and thank for the tip about getting happy hour orders in.  Guess you missed out entirely cuz we stick to water after that. AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!!

CLOSED to the PUBLIC on weekends! Stupid, stupid, stupid! Parents want to play with their kids on weekends. Not attend ridiculously overpriced gift collections. Place is small. Place is unsafe. Parents and staff do not supervise kids. Go to the park instead...it is free!!!!

Ok first impressions are What??? EVERYTHING!!! That is right everything. So the night starts with this douchebag sitting in the prime patio area puffing away on a cheap Cuban imitation cigar. C'MON!!!!! Really?!?!?!? WTF fuck is wrong with management of this place???  So we move inside. 30 minutes later we flag down someone to take care of us. Then another douchebag comes in puffing on her vapor puff. WTF...AGAIN MANAGEMENT! It is one thing when it is outside. But inside where there is food and people and one douchebags kid?!?!?!?  C'mon!!!!   So like 1.5 hours later we get this junk delivered...ummm food. Apparently we should have ordered the nachos. Because that is what everyone is yelping about, right?!?!?  So here is my honest assessment. The loaded fries disgusting looking and even worse tasting. The sliders...well 70% beef and 30% grease fat and chunks of something. The Pretzel bite...something to be desired with the nasty cheese dip and the beers are appropriately dry being in the middle of the desert.   So back to the patio for another couple hours of fantastic music and lung-fulls of secondhand smoke. C'mon people, didn't smoking go out with the 80's.   My recommendation to the band....find a better venue. You are better than this place. My recommendations to civilization. Stay away! My recommendation to the patrons...change. My recommendation to management...you can do better. There is a reason most of the tables inside are empty!!!!

Awesome fitness facility. They do a great job making sure you stick to the plan. Motivate you. Encourage you. Compliment you. This place is worth every calorie burned!!!!  P.S. If you see any one from the Vive here, tell them to go back to their community gym. This gym doesn't like whiners that can't handle 3 hours of live music in the middle of an afternoon.

Aaaahhhh spa day. Time to get trimmed and painted. The ladies here are so nice. None of that awkward talking in their own language while working on you. They take care of you and talk to you while you are being pampered.   Also bring your little girls here for some pampering too. They are so sweet to the littles. The girls just love and eat it all up. Quality mommy daughter bonding time because it is not always about the escape.   If you live at the Vive...paint your own damn nails. We don't want your cars in the parking lot.

Wait what???  4 stars for a brat??? Exactly! One has to question how they ended up with 4 stars...unless wait it was a bunch of their friends and family or something.   Let's start with the server...when you're cool versed in that much ink...cover up. That body covered in that much ink and that lack of clothing made us lose our appetites.   So let's see...brat ink forgot to take our drink orders. Not that it mattered because even after she got the order she forgot to get the drinks.   The pretzel is the worst burnt-like pretzel ever. I am having a hard time to come up with words to describe that nastiness. The cheese sauce was so bad they had to put chives in it to give it flavor.   The garlic fries had this amazing flavor of week old burnt deep-frier oil combined with this oil soaked chewiness and undercooked potatoes. It is amazing how a fry cook could mess up fries this bad.   The brats...which they are know for...seem like they were sitting out in the AZ sun for days. Where else can one bite into a juicy brat and get dried up ground pork or boar or dog instead.  Come to the Brat Haus for this one of a kind experience!!!!  Take it one level better...slap that lifeless brat into a gooey chewy oversize hoagie roll. Cover it in one of their toppings sans sauerkraut and keep looking for the spicy mustard at your local grocery store...not here because warm Dijon is your best choice.   Should have know better as soon as I saw falafel on the menu...das es nichts gut!!!! Aufiderzein!!!!

September 2015:  I have dirty carpets thanks to pets and toddlers. I get them cleaned several times a year. I had an urgent need to get these carpets cleaned. I had an open schedule for exactly 11 days. So I called Mr Rob I clean carpets personally. The day goes by. No callback.   I call the next day.  Again the day goes by an no callback.   I call again. I give specifics so I can get an estimate over the phone. The day goes by. Still no call back.   I call again. Leave yet another message because there is NO HUMAN BEING that answers the phone EVER! Guess what....that's right...no call back.   After 11 days there is still no call back. After the entire month of September there is no call back. Now well into October I see a message that this review is not relevant to my experience...well here is the detail relating exactly to my experience. THERE IS NO CALLBACK EVER FROM I CLEAN CARPETS which exactly deserves 1 star because 0 stars is not an option.   This business is to busy to focus on customer care and quality. Recommend finding another provider. There are way to many companies out there that can do the same if not better job than this one. Oh and they will call you back and show up the next day and do a stellar job!!!!

Everyone love a fiesta right???? Well this is the place to get your Cinco D'Mayo on!!!  Start with the nachos layered and piled high with all the fixings!!! Beuno!! This could be a meal in its own but bring all your friends and share because we are just getting me started. Try the queso. Bueno!! Try the guacamole. Bueno!! Drink the top shelf margaritas!! Bueno!!!  For the main course...pick anything. I've tried it all and was never disappointed. Ask them about their favorite shrimp dish...the way they describe it is exactly why I get it almost every other time I go here.   Sit on the patio...and flip off the people at the Vive. They are the losers that prevent this place from having mariachi every night of the week. But that is what this place needs. More music. More salsa. More merengue. Bring your dog especially if you have a chihuahua. But if you live at the Vive...sty home...your dogs, your cars, your drunk walks home aren't wanted at this establishment.

OK PEOPLE...time for a REAL review.  The ONLY thing this restaurant has going for it is the wait time in a Sunday morning...walk in and get seated. That is because the place is not busy here is why:  1) The place is FILTHY. From the end tails  and smears on the tables, to the seats with crumbs spots and food/skid marks to the tops of the booths that have at least 1 month of dust, lint and dirt build up.   2) The food was horrible!  For example the 5 minute rice was either cooked for 3 minutes or cooked the night before. The pork was approximately 50% fat and 50% meat which is being extremely generous in the meat allocation. The scrambled eggs were rubbery like they were pulled from the stay warm buffet. Ahh the buffet...leaves a lot to be desired for a buffet. They actually serve the end pieces of the toast...perhaps the owner likes them and so should everyone else. And finally the bacon...careful asking for crispy....it will be cooked and then deep fried to the point of turning to dust.   3) Wanna be Village Inn pie concept sans pies with a sully's tavern kind of flair using furniture that makes things made in China sold by KMart and IKEA Look like high end quality furnishing.   4) Service...well if you mess up the order...comp the meal, make it right, comp something else...don't server the end tails.    Never going back and neither should you. Recommend closing this place. THE END!

Disappointing wait time. Then we were paged to be seated and were required to stand there and wait watching our empty table wait for us for 5 minutes but they kindly informed us we could play with the dirty toys that have NEVER been washed outside....wait we just did that for 45 minutes!    OMG avoid the OMG French toast because the OMG you are expecting is more like OMG they just cut one large piece of bread into 4 pieces and OMG charge $10 and OMG I am going die of starvation.   Don't come thirsty either...waiting for a refill will take an entire meal. Perhaps because the concept of busboys is left to the servers and the hostess that is more than eager to pull your plate with food still on it!  Looking forward to the new locations in Tempe and Gilbert because this location leaves a lot to be desired. Hopefully the new places are arranged to handle the crowds with comfortable seating and staff trained to serve and move food, drinks and people. Otherwise they will be hearing from me there as well

So 3 strikes you're out right?  Strike 1. Breakfast. Who starts a restaurant that has only one component required for making a portion of the breakfast menu??? The Perch. That's right...well the maker is out of commission and therefore the only thing I wanted on the menu was not able to be made. Walk next door and check out Yoli's!!! Yummy friendly fun!!!!  Strike 2. Dinner. Show up for dinner. Looking at the venue we see that about 1/3 of the tables are empty. No problem right? Wrong!!! The Perch again!  Placed us on a 25 minute wait. Well...perhaps because they don't know how to turn tables so that wait turned into 1 hour and 20 minute wait. And NO updates! And every time we checked on the status...still a very inaccurate estimate of wait. Sadly I tried 3 of the wines and rejected 3 of the wines because they are that bad! Also not impressed with some of the beers. Of course the variety is impressive when you want to try something new or different. Back to dinner. Well the selection was very limited and I have a very robust palette...needless to say the food did not taste that good and was pricey to boot.   Strike 3: Drinks. Ok so it is late...close to 9. Clearly only the doofs are out eating dinner at this time. So what is left??? The Drinkers and Dessert Eaters. Right? Not for the Perch!  Again we walk in and 1/3 to 1/2 of the tables are empty...with a 30 minute wait. We know how that goes. So off to the roof to park it and drink. Nope...this place is undeservingly busy and no way of accommodating the demand. So back down the stairs to the bar. Tables Everywhere!!! We sit. We are in the bar. At bar top tables. Do we should get drinks right? Not at the Perch!!! These are restaurant seating tables. Not walk up like any other bar area at any other restaurant in the Phoenix metro area. We were asked to move because the table is not walk up. So we moved to the bar and got obnoxious to scare off some patrons to make room for our group. That works! For us at least...sorry Perch your rules you'll lose. So we pass on dessert because who wants to eat that at the bar. We sampled the wines...why because if you sample all then that is like a free glass or two!!! Sorry Perch. We watched our table sit vacant for 50 minutes and then they sat 2 people at the 6 seater where they kicked out the 4 of us. One orders water. One orders tea. They split an appetizer.  So the Perch made $7 on the table that we would have spent $100 all night long. Instead we each had our free glass and then bought a glass of house each...spent $20 and stiffed the overly tattooed grunge hippy bartenders providing the poor service.   PLUS DID I MENTION THE HORID SMELL OF BIRD POOP AS YOU WALK UP TO THE PLACE OR AS A WHIFF COMES BY AS YOUR EAT?!?!??  The Perch is a NO GO!  Sorry. I tried.

NOT EVEN 9:15 PM AND THEY CLOSED THE KITCHEN!!!! What the hell else do they have going on in a Thursday night. So much for having hours open until 10PM.   And while I am at it...Rock Lobster is a band in AZ and should sue this establishment over naming rights.   Next time feed the starving customers...I would have dropped $100-150 easily tonight.   Off to find real Sushi...Blue Wasabi perhaps!

Finally a place that ensures Uncle Bears is a place to be forgotten.   So we start with forgiving the owner for the giant Red and White flag in the front. It is sort of like wearing the UT color and horns as well...it is like a big old badge of to dumb to know better. But roots are roots...look at Baltimore. Roots sets society back more than 100 years.  Forgive and forget, right?  Let's start with greeting by the beautiful hostesses. Been to this place 4 times now...the place is always busy but we have never had to wait for a table. Really like that!!!  Burgers are phenomenal. Beer selection is even better. Waitresses are at the top of their game...oh and you can catch any game there from any angle. Watch out for the side of sweet potato tots...for a couple of bucks they would happily satisfy a table of 4 to 6.   This is my favorite place to get a burger...it should be yours too!!!!  WARNING: Be weary of the idiots that live at the Vive...they are a few fries short of a happy meal and really should not frequent any of the places in the shopping center.

PRICE GOUGING AT THE BEST!!!! 6/2/2015  So they clearly built this abnormally large facility without a plan on how to pay for it...enter the clientele. They will Village Suck every Penny from you! Save your time and money and check out the YMCA!!  Let's start with no group rate!!! Nope, nada, zip, zilch...not even going to discuss it.  No corporate rates, no community rates, no school rates, no veterans rates, no senior rates, no gay rates, no straight rates, no black rates!!!!  NOTHING!  They were not willing to provide a group rate (she even stated that their Intel rate is higher than their specials right now).  Anyways, here's the scoop:  The enrollment fee is $450 right now. They are offering a $50 off coupon for the month of June, so $400. That's for a family or individual plan. She stated that this is half of the other clubs in Phoenix. Right {cough Planet Fitness}!!! If you don't take the 7 day trial, they will discount this to $300, but that is as low as they will go. {Cough Studio Fit free 2 weeks}  For the month of June, they are offering $500 in member incentives. The package includes several things like a 30 minute massage, 30 minute pilaties, 60 minutes of personal training, etc.) Also, the month of July is free (waive monthly costs).  As to the membership rates, they are $159/mo + $76 for a significant other = $235/couple. Children are $42 (1-6 children, not per child). If you don't pay for children to be on your plan, the rates below go up. It comes to a difference of $2/mo.  Child care is additional for children under 5. It's $4/hr/child, max 3hrs/day. But they also offer an unlimited plan which makes sense if you use more than 11 hours/mo. It's $55/child, $90/2 children, or $125/3 children.  So, a family plan ($277/mo) + child care for 3 ($125) = $402/mo!  THAT IS A NICE CAR PAYMENT PEOPLE!!!!  Not even if I had unlimited disposable income would I pay for that!!!  No bar...no drinks at the spa! No high end dinner restaurant. Healthy gluten free lunch cafeteria at $15-22 per meal. Can you imagine the pretentious socializing that will commence here??  No top golf. No water park. Staff fresh out of college...lacking experience...hey have to minimize costs somehow...planning on outsourcing to India as soon as they find a provider. Guess how many plys the toilet paper is at this place?!?!?!?  Check out lifetime fitness on 6/2/2015. They are waiving enrollment fees if you mention considering the Village!!!  Please stop gouging the residents of Chandler...we deserve $50/month health/fitness access not at our expense of the poor planing for your facility rates.

FIXED POOR RESTAURANT MANAGEMENT!!! January 8, 2016. Yeah they are 3 weeks old...sure they might get better.   Welcome to the popularity of Ocotillo Friends.  They can make and break your business in a heartbeat.    So we tried this place again and it is getting much better. We asked for changes below and the team at singing panda made some changes for the better.   Great Chinese!  Oh and check out the singing Elvis!!!! He is just awesome!   1) Fix your restaurant layout formal hostess stand separate from to go orders 2) Add more tables. You clearly don't have enough.  3) Hire a professional kitchen manager.      A) Someone should be dedicated to drinks and refills. Hire a buser for that and clearing tables.      B) Someone should be dedicated to getting out appetizers. If people have something to munch on the rest is less painful.      C) Prepare food in advance.     D) Ventilate the restaurant...lung cancer is not worth it!  Ocotillo Friends...try this place again!
