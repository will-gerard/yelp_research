I am giving this place 5 stars for a strip mall nail salon. It isn't super fancy, but for what it is, it is a great place. The salon is quiet and clean. The people were very nice and they got to me quickly even though I was a walk-in. The woman doing my nails (Loan) was very nice and professional. She clearly paid attention to detail and did a wonderful job on my nails. And I only paid $25 for a gel manicure! I will definitely be returning.

I LOVE Culvers! Their butter burgers and cheese curds are mouth-watering and I always order their creamy home-brewed root beer. And their custard is always wonderful. I am utterly addicted to this place.

I have never gotten my eyebrows done and almost went to someone far more expensive, but they were booked weeks out. I saw good reviews and good prices for this place and I'm glad I went! The people there were so friendly, making an appointment was easy and they got my sister done as a walk in at the same time they took care of me. They were quick and professional and my eyebrows look GREAT! My sister and mom got theirs tinted and their brows also look fabulous. You can't beat the price either. I will DEFINITELY be coming back!

I was not impressed with this place. I called because I wanted a last minute manicure and it was close by. The woman on the phone quoted me their special price of $25 for a gel manicure. The man doing my nails was nice, but it was weirdly quiet in there. No music or anything. I had a glitter overcoat on my nails and, while I appreciate that he was trying to get a lot of glitter on my nails, it turned out lumpy. He had to fix two nails and there was another lump I didn't bother asking him to fix. And the Polish is off the nail on a few fingers... When I went to pay, he said it was $35, not $25! When I said what I had been quoted he said that was fine. But, even though it said they take card, he asked me to go to the grocery store next door and get cash out. Which required me to buy something. Then they only have multiples of $10, so I paid him $30 (after I had already tipped him) and he didn't offer to give me change. I don't think I will be going to this place again.... I ended up paying as much as I would have at a higher end place anyways.

I've bend here a couple times bc we got a Groupon for oil changes. If it wasn't for the coupon, I'd never go here. I'm always waiting to be helped with no acknowledgement even when workers walk in and see me and others waiting. I came once with an appointment and once without to get an oil change and I don't think having an appointment helps at all. This time it's taken over 2 hours and I can't get anyone to stop so I can ask how much longer it will take. And I made an appointment. The first time I called to make an appointment, they actually hung up on me instead of answering. I had to call back to get ahold of someone.  When I went to pay, I asked if I needed to pay for the synthetic oil upgrade and he told me not to worry about it. Which was very nice since it took so long, but the way he said it makes me think they didn't actually use synthetic oil... And it doesn't say synthetic oil on my receipt. I won't be going here again if I don't have to.

I went here a while ago and my husband, who has rated a lot of BBQ all over the country, said it was the best he's ever had! I don't have his experience, but I would agree with him. The people working there are really nice and the food is DELICIOUS!!! Go there now!!

AMAZING barbecue! Seriously maybe the best place in AZ. The owner is a really nice, friendly guy, our food came out quickly, and, most importantly, everything was DELICIOUS! I highly recommend this place!

Good food very mediocre service. I LOVE the candy chicken. The soup is great too. That's about all I've tried but my friends have ordered other things and had very positive things to say. The staff is very friendly but not the most competent. It took a very long time for someone to take my order at the drive thru and an oddly long time to get my food. Another time when I walked in for take out, it seemed like a bunch of the staff's friends were just hanging out and it made ordering a little awkward bc they weren't paying attention to the customers. And they got my order wrong that time. I ordered mochi, but they gave me a slushi thing. I wasn't that angry though, because it turned out to be delicious. So go for awesome, inexpensive, easy food, but don't expect the same level of amazingness from the service. Just be patient and all will be well.
