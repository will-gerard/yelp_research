The best experience here today! Pulled in on my way to get my kids from school. Tire was audibly leaking air. They not only pulled it & put on my spare so I could pick up my kids on time, they fixed it while I was gone. Upon my return to get the tire, they got me right in and out. Thanks guys!! You're the best!!! This is why I ALWAYS buy from Discount.

Always our favorite place to eat for Sushi. Fish is consistently awesome. Even our fish-hating daughter loves to come here for the edamame, and teriyaki chicken. I like the gyozas, and tempura. Husband's favorite is the Stay Fresh special with FRESH (ie: real) wasabi. New servers take some time to break in, but they soon know us by name. :D

Tastiest Indian food we've had! Soooooo good. So so good. The vegetarian options are great, a nice place where carnivores & herbivores can enjoy their dining experiences together.   Check in on Yelp for your free dessert!

This restaurant closed for a few days in Feb. 2016 for a remodel. They should close it again & put it back. The majority of the sushi is now gone & what's left isn't worth the cost.   The service has always been fairly mediocre, but for good food, we would always take our patience with us.   Bad food & bad service make this once regular joint for us a no go now.

We frequent here for Saturday breakfast, and are rarely disappointed! On occasion the staff can be slow, but the manager is fantastic! He knows us now, and can practically put our order in when we walk in the door. :D My kids love their m&m pancakes. Husband loves the lox. I like my eggs over easy, and they do 'em right.   If you like crispy bacon, make sure you order it crispy!

This restaurant has the best Pho in the valley! Everyone in my family has something they love on the menu. The service is phenomenal. Customizing your dish is a breeze. The restaurant is clean & lovely. They're closed on Sunday ().   Give Simi's a try. You'll be back.
