I've never been one to gravitate toward theme/chain tourist trap establishments, though, for their memorabilia and crap, I can see the allure. Buy a beer, walk around and see some dead guys' guitars. Done. At least, that's what I observed might have been cool to do when I ended up there after the Depeche Mode concert across the street @ US Airways Center (I miss BOB, it made it so much more personable, but anyway).    So, DM let out about quarter til 11, and my group all decided to go grab one @ the Hard Rock, and maybe get something to eat. When we walked up, 2 blonde waitrons were at the door, holding it open for us, saying "Just so you know we just called last call, and aren't serving food. In fact, we should already be closed." CHARMED! So, a music-themed restaurant/bar, located directly across from an arena that frequently hosts ummm, CONCERTS, wouldn't plan to capitalize on the outflow of excited music fans and perhaps stay open  and make some monayyy? OK. As a bartender, I'd have insisted that it be so. This summer sucked for the service industry, and I found it so surprising that such an establishment wouldn't have been more malleable to perhaps retain and dare I say, boost the morale of their  staff by anticipating and catering to a late crowd of people who'd rather spend $5 (ok, $5.46) as opposed to $11 @ the arena for some post-concert frosty bevs. Have a little bump in their take-home scrilla for the night, and I dunno, fun? Meh.  And there were about 15 other people in there at the bar, too. The only person there who was workin it was the bartendress, though, she too, seemed like she was a bit put-out that she had a bunch of customers come in last-minute. I do give her props for salting the rim of my pint glass and pouring a DosXX for me without having the salt volcano all the beer out of the glass.   Maybe it's the corporate management bs that was in the way. Maybe not. Either way, they need to get it together on the hospitality tip.

We are hungry, we do not want to go on an expedition. We want spicy, cheesy goodness. And a margarita. We decide to hit up Arriba's since they're just up the street, and per our usual chill demeanor, sidle up to the little bar to grab a margarita, and decide what spicy green chile dishes we want to eat.   Now, I haven't been to this place in a couple years, and the last time I went, was driven there, half in the bag after watching a softball tournament. At that time, maybe I didn't care so much, maybe it was because I couldn't see the bartender making my drinks, I don't know....BUT  If you are a *new* bartender, don't upsell me a handmade margarita with Cuervo, instead of your house concoction that comes out of a tap,  use the small side of the jigger to pour said tequila into one of those ridiculous tiny cactus margarita glasses, haphazardly salted, expect me to pay $6 for tiny little glass and crappy pour, and somehow appreciate that you have any understanding of what it means to make a good margarita - you know, one where the orange from the triple sec lightly dances with the tequila flavors rising above the  sweet and sour and the tang of fresh lime juice - especially when you still haven't given me a menu, and are now serving jiggerless poured Crown and diets and Jack and diets to your 21 and a half-year old friends who are leaning all over the bar with slithering arrogance and no sense of personal space (yes, I can smell your drugstore perfume, and no, it doesn't make you pretty).  So, no, I don't want this crappy tiny margarita, and no, I don't even think I want to eat here.   We went to La Pinata instead, because that's what we should have done in the first place.

Heard about this place for some time, and my neighbor is a big fan of the Monday night happy hour deals, so I decided to give it a whirl with the gf.  Our hunger couldn't wait til nighttime, so we hit it up for a late lunch. Holy YUM!  Bacon-wrapped shrimp: giant shrimp stuffed with cotija and crispity delicious bacon. A heart-stopper, for sure, but damn, sooo good. We then split a blue-cheese wedge salad and a green chile burger, and both were perfectly put together, fresh and delicious.  Green chiles could have had more heat to them, but that burger was cooked perfectly, not too greasy, juicy bites on a nice firm roll that held up all the way through. And great pickles, too.  Would have liked a nice IPA offered on draft, as opposed to the bottle option, but other than that, we really dug it. FABULOUS service by Karla, who left us alone just enough, but was always ready to freshen up our waters or make sure we were enjoying our food.

Sooooo good!  I don't go nearly as often as I'd like, but when I do, the enchiladas, cheese crisp with green chiles, and the chimichanga are my favorites. Even though its so busy it can be unnerving, if you get a seat, take your time with your food, they won't rush you out of there.  mmmm

Ahhhhh the irony! The gf and I woke up Labor Day, and we were gonna go for it. We were going for the Dick's!  Arrived at 11am, and it was busy, but we still got 2 seats right at the bar. sweet. Ordered Bloody Marys and our bartender gave us 2 little sidecars of DosXX. Wha? "It's all about you, today," and he smiled. So cool. We were tired, hungover, and this was such a nice bright touch to start our day.    Tenderloin Benedict (medium rare) for me, Adovada for the lady. Clean plates: indeed!  I'm really a bitch about a good hollandaise and man, I have got to hand it to them, they do it proper. The adovada was saucy and totally hump-worthy.  What a fantastic way to start off my Fall. This Kitty is a-purring!

I was at work, trapped behind the bar, and we were all out of snack chips...Staaarvving!  I really didn't want to order close to $20 worth of food to get delivered, but as I perused our folder full of menus that had delivery service, I started to salivate when I started reading the Z Pizza menu. It's a very colorful, attractive menu, and had a bright yellow sticker that said "free delivery" (as opposed to Mamma Mia, whom I love, but $2 delivery and $10 minimum, well, anyway, I'm digressing).  What to get, what to get, it sucks when you're just that hungry and all these pretty combinations of toppings jump out at you saying, 'pick me,' Little tomatoes with white gloves were high kicking like Rockettes with their arms linked with Mr. Mozzarella and his top hat and monocle. Wait, that was Mr. Peanut, anyway...So I decided on the Provence, which was described as having artichokes, tomatoes, capers and garlic sauce, in addition to the mozzarella and regular tomato sauce. I love me some capers.  It seemed a queer combination, but I love all these ingredients and was eager to have a little adventure. I called in my order, and the girl on the phone recognized me from the bar, and we chatted about the pizza, decided I should have a little truffle oil thrown on there as well. What arrived, still hot, and perfectly baked, was one of the tastiest pizzas I've had delivered in a while. The crust was so crunchy and the truffle oil had soaked into it, so it was like its own separate hors d'ouevre after I made my way to what I would normally call the pizza butt.  The toppings were tasty, fresh, and the combination was truly a treat. I don't know about the garlic sauce, it was a bit too much, but maybe in a lesser quantity the flavor would have melded and not been so obtrusive. I was a happy Kitty, and the next day, it reheated like a champ for a little lunch revisited. Good stuff, that Z Pizza. Oh, and my favorite was the little Kitty face drawn on the side of the box next to my phone number.  Nice touch.

Having been dumped by my favorite stylist, who went on to pursue a different *cough* career, I was pretty scared to go looking for a new person I could trust with my hair. Like, "I want something short that's not cookie cutter, and do something with the color. Be an artist."  That's what I was looking for, and, on the recommendation of a friend, and a casual consultation on a Saturday night, decided to put my hair in Adele's hands. I'm sure I scared the crap out of her when I said, "Do whatever you want." But, really, who's going to let their client leave with shitty hair?  I was amazed. She's actually better than my old stylist with color. Very creative, attentive, and in general , just has a great demeanor that makes hanging out with foils in your hair for a few hours pretty enjoyable. The entire staff is really down-to-earth and cool to talk to. They treat you like you're in their living room and make you feel right at home. I've been going for almost a year now, and every time we do something different and fun with my hair that always receives major compliments when I go out. I love Adele, and love this salon!

$3 Spicy Bloody Mary - absolutely the best I've had so far in Phoenix (besides my own, of course!). No eggs bennie on the regular brunch offerings, but they had a Turkey Benedict Biscuit as a special, so I went for it. The hollandaise was a little chalky, but serviceable, on the perfectly poached eggs. What really sent the dish over the top was the fresh avocado that made for quite the rich and creamy bite of turkey, egg, and biscuit. Saucy goodness! Service was friendly, attentive, and made me feel right at home. A good brunch, for me, is a fair indicator of how serious a restaurant is about their food. Playful, yet assertive, Maizie's definitely won me over.

After an amazing Depeche Mode concert, and ensuing idiotic try @ the Hard Rock, my posse and I headed over to Hanny's with a hunger and a thirst that needed to be sated. And, since we heard they did the late-night food thing @ Hanny's, it sounded perfect.  Dude...Whoa...That's pretty much what happened when my friend and I went up the stairs through the fun-house mirrored corridor to find the bathrooms. I felt like I was in a messed-up dream and one of the doors was hiding the gates of hell. It was bizarre, vertiginous, and I wasn't sure that I'd be able to go back through that hallway to get to the main dining level. Whooo! But I had to pee later, and everything was ok on the second trip. But it sure as hell needed getting used to.  But still, an amazing space, very "Logan's Run" in the crisp, almost sterile, blue/green hues that pervaded throughout.  I didn't feel like I was in Phoenix at all. Too big, too groovy, too put-together. I could envision the place packed to the gills like a NYC joint.   No pretentiousness that I experienced, which, from the looks of the place, I was a little wary at first. We got down with some Peroni's, which I enjoyed, as not many places carry that beer. Ordered a couple flatbread pizzas which were super-tasty, and some potato strings that were just kinda fun to eat. Pretty much just had a good, easy-going time, drinking and eating with chill tunes saturating the environment. Our server, aside from possessing spectacularly classic beauty, was really cool and down-to-earth, attentive, helpful...just awesome.    As a sweaty pedestrian post-concert goer, I had a great experience, and was glad to be treated so warmly late on a Sunday night. I will definitely go back whenever I'm downtown. Yay!

Tuesday is my favorite day, and last week, on a Tuesday, naturally, the gf and I went up to Postinos around 3:30, to do a little $5 wine and some bruschetta.  Wellll, as if it couldn't get any better, they just started, that day, $20 for a bottle of house wine AND a plate of bruschetta. How could we resist?  Bruschetta favorites definitely were the smoked salmon and prosciutto with fig and mascarpone, accompanied by the La Linda Viognier.  We ended up doing another round of bruschetta with a bottle of the Riesling, left completely toasted (we live 3 blocks away, phew!), and think this deal is the devil. $40 for 2 bottles of wine and 2 bruschetta plates??? Too damn good.  From the service, the ambience, the food, fantastic wine, there is nothing I can say bad about the joint.

Talkin bout fooood, talkin bout issues that are very delicious...  I say, ok, I summoned Barry Gibb for a minute.  I absolutely LOVE this place! Went for dinner with some friends to check it out and I'm thoroughly impressed. We each ordered a different drink: Michelada, Margarita, and White Sangria.  The spicy salt rim on the Michelada just rocked. Very refreshing in this summer heat. The sangria was well balanced and not overly sweet, and the Margarita was tits on... Starting with the corn, rolled in delicious cotija cheese and smoked paprika, we were wishing there were more than one cob, but managed to share nicely...Then the guacamole: Fresh, savory, and an ample portion to dip our freshly made tortilla strips... And since there were just the 3 of us, we ordered 3 of each of their tacos. Pork, Beef and Fish.  Everything marinated in its own unique sauce and perfectly tender, seasoned, just exquisite.  Great atmosphere, unpretentious, wonderful attention to detail both in ingredients and plating, and extremely reasonable prices. It's become my favorite place to pop in, if just to grab some of that amazing guac or a couple tacos to go...maybe a Michelada to take by the pool...If I can manage to wake up early enough, I'm very much looking forward to trying the breakfast..

I stopped in to pick up some Green Curry tofu to go, and have to agree that unless you've got a crew, the seating setup doesn't  seem like it would lend itself to intimate dining. But it's not anything unexpected as far as decor. Much like the Indian restaurants on 8th Street in NYC, if it doesn't look like the inside of a fully lit Christmas tree, there's something wrong.  I enjoyed the substantive look of the chairs and tables, actually. Compared to the converted diner look of Thai Rama, there's much more opportunity for ambience in the evening, for sure.  Back to my food: I asked for it hot, and said "I can handle it." I likes me some spicy. The hostess was super nice and I waited maybe ten minutes before my to-go bag arrived.  As a lunch special, it came with a spring roll and soup, which made quite the spread for ten bucks. The green curry was awesomely spicy, savory and the veggies were nice and crisp, however, I would have liked a firmer tofu in it. The rice was nice and sticky and aromatic, too.   Overall, I think Thai E San gave me a great calling card with that one dish. I will definitely go back with friends to try some more dishes we can all share to explore more of what the restaurant has to offer.

On the lovely Sunday over MLK weekend, my friends and I rode our bikes down to this joint to see what was a-happenin'. What was happening at the outdoor bar was a huge gay circuit party, which was kind of awesome to see on a Sunday afternoon. We veered left, to grab some food before shoehorning ourselves into the Rebar gaiety. Service was a little weird in that we kind of stood around waiting for someone to acknowledge us and be seated - Do we go inside, just have a seat? what? But then we were cheerfully seated on the patio without much waiting.   Nitty-gritty: chips and salsa were good, but the salsa was totally the old spicy smoky one they had at Ticoz, I swears! (loved it then, not sure what the slight twist they did to it for Bliss, but it's aight still)  Tortilla pizza thing with the pesto, tomato and mozz: meh. there was no zip to it. Very oily and heavy.  Shrimp tempura tacos? Some tasty business. Generously filled with fattie shrimps, and just fresh, crispy and delicious. Didn't come served with any lemon wedges, so we totally ghetto fished the wedges out of our water glasses, and it made a big diff.   Not so great was waiting half an hour for our cocktail order. That's the sucky thing about restaurant service when the waiter has to depend on the bar to make drinks for them. Considering how slammed the bar was with cocktailing 'mos, I understand, but it makes for bad service over on the restaurant side. We were comped our delicious white sangrias for having to wait so long, and that was very much appreciated.  And then, we went to the bar. It was less packed than when we arrived, but still pretty populated, the bartender, David, was just catching up and picking up all the crap he had to clean up after being hit so hard. I thought he was the only bartender there, but it turns out there was another one at the decidedly less busy inside bar area. Didn't seem like outdoor guy had much help, which sucks. I'm sure they made good money that day, but could have probably made a sh*t-ton more with better staffing.   Despite David clearly being pummelled, he was amazingly even-tempered, gracious and polite, and made excellent cocktails, though we had to coach him (only the once) to chill the vodka in our bombers. It was a great place to be on a Sunday afternoon, just hanging out, unpretentious, and 2-4-1 doesn't suck one bit. Definitely will be rolling down there some more.
