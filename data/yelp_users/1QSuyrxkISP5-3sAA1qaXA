Bill Johnson's Has Lost Its Giddyup and Should Just Go  A friend and popped into Bill Johnson's for lunch unplanned. We should have planned better.  Now looking for a lighter fare perhaps we shouldn't have tried a "cowboy" establishment, but I was still craving some down home cooking after a disappointing trip to Chilleens on 17 (you can check out my review of them as well if you'd like), so we took a shot.  Service was friendly enough and they had Kiltlifter on tap; a redeeming grace for any establishment in my humble opinion. My friend tried a smothered chicken breast and I went for the sautéed tilapia since I was wanting something a tad lighter. But I was still craving some good baked beans and a baked potato with the works sounds delicious. My friend went for the green beans and the interesting sounding green chile mac and cheese.  The food took a while to get there. So long that I was beginning to think the fish was a good choice since clearly they were having to still catch it and kill it. When it arrived I was far from impressed. The sides were lukewarm at best yet the fish was hot; telling me that things sat around waiting for the cook to prepare my fish. I now wish they had found somewhere else to go.  While my friend's chicken wasn't bad with peppers and onions and cheese, the smothering was hiding a near inedible edge to the breast. Clearly cooked at too hit a temp and ruining the edges of the meat. My fish had received the same treatment. Add over spicing with pepper and some loathsome lemon butter goo, and you get a relatively unpleasant meal.   The sides were no better. Bland canned baked beans once again and the "cheese" sauce was as runny as water in the mac and cheese.  This review seems somewhat redundant after all the other bad reviews if this place, but now I know to check the Yelp before moseyin' into this corral.

When I came here yesterday I was ready to give them one star, but the friendly staff won me back. Mark is the bomb! (Pardon the tired vernacular.) Today's doctor saw me right on time, unlike yesterday when I just left after being kept waiting for fifty minutes. My time is valuable too folks! But today Mark was attentive, helpful and fun to sit and chat with as we went over my options. Instead of trying to up sell me on options I didn't need, we looked everything over and chose the best options for me. Kudos to Mark!!! If I wasn't leaving town I'd be back every year because of him and the rest of the friendly staff.

Four Peaks Will Peak Your Interest  The main reason anyone would go to Four Peaks Brewing Company is for the excellent beers. Kiltlifter is one of my favorites with its clean taste and slightly sweet finish. Grabbing a sampler, however is the way to start any experience at Four Peaks.  The menu at Four Peaks is worth checking out as well, though, and you won't be disappointed with the results. The filet mignon was phenomenal. While it won't win any calorie counting contest, the stout brew glaze makes an already succulent piece of meat into a joyful meal. Everything I've tried at Four Peaks just has me looking forward to my next visit.  The service is friendly, the orders arrived quickly, and the ambience is perfect for what you want in a brewery; vats. There's always something special about being surrounded by the creation of liquid golds, ambers, and dark magic. You'll start with the sampler, and then be given every reason to come back again and again.

When I'm in the mood for an Irish pub I go to Tim Finnegans. Guiness on tap, of course, my favorite Scottish ale, Kiltlifter, and amazing food make this a great place to stop with friends. Live music will fill the joint and a good game will bring a noisy crowd, or if you want a quiet evening drop in on a quiet Monday and enjoy a Dirty Kilt amongst the dark wood interior with the friendly staff.   I like Finnegans and all its moods and I know you will too.

Bad service? How about NO SERVICE! I was at the "Sodium Chloride Stuffed Female" for 3.5 hours and never once was I approached by a server, greeted, offered a menu or asked if I needed anything; for three and a half hours!! I saw plenty of servers; young ladies more interested in chatting up the young men at the next table over, but never once was approached. Even the bartender seemed bothered to open a couple of bottles of beer for me and my lady. And bottle were all they had. Even the tap system wasn't working and there was no draft beer!!!   It's too bad, really, how crappy this place is on service. With an outdoor volley ball court, fire pits, and more, I would have really enjoyed lingering and coming back. As it was, the only reason we were there was a friend's birthday. But since I was never offered food, or drinks, one server even just walked past out table as we yelled "Shots! Shots!" And would have just walked away if we hadn't grabbed her and demanded service. This place must be losing $1000s of dollars a night if they treat others the way they treated us. I won't be going back to a place that clearly doesn't value it's customers. I can put up with a lot if I can get good service, but the Salty Señorita isn't worth tolerating.

Wow! The food arrived before I could even finish checking in on Yelp. The fries are just what I like and the turkey avocado sandwich with bacon is excellent!! It's not loaded down with greasy mayo or sauces, just simple and fresh and delicious. And Sara is the kind of server everyone would hope to have :). Great experience. Even watching the playoff game while enjoying the meal. Good stuff.
