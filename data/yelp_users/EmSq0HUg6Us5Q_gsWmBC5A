BR is a trusted bike dealer in the valley. Their sales people and mechanics are extremely knowledgable. I wish they sold specialized bikes, but with that being said they do have a great inventory of trek and cannondale.

I'm new to triathlons and had a lot of first-timer questions. Triple Sports went out of their way to answer all them. The salespeople were friendly, knowledgeable and genuinely excited for my first TRI experience. I was outfitted with quality equipment that fit within my budget and it was great to know that my dollars were going to supporting a local business. I have since recommended Triple Sports to friends and they loved it too.

My wife and I adopted our two Amazon parrots from Arizona Exotic Bird Rescue. We couldn't be happier with our experience. Tyler and Curt are extremely knowledgeable and take excellent care of the birds. Tyler and Curt also do an excellent job of continuing to support the birds even after adoption. We have used them as a resource on behavioral questions and we bring our birds back to the rescue for beak and nail trims. My hat is off to them for the wonderful care that Az Bird Rescue provides to birds in need.

Selberg Electric is awesome! The reviews didn't lie. He came over within a 1/2 hour of my call and changed three circuit breakers for me. All for a very reasonable price. And he's a super nice guy! I highly recommend him!

Shelby BentodoO' is by far the best hair stylist in the valley. Since I started going to Shelby I've gotten many compliments on my do. She truly deserves the title "The Organic Hair Goddess".

The easiest review ever. GET YOUR WINDOWS TINTED HERE. I called a number of other tinting companies in Scottsdale and no one even came close to the price or craftsmanship of James at Sunset Tint. James is super friendly and takes pride in what he does. I will definitely be a repeat customer.

My wife and I started training with Andrea over a year ago. Since then we have both experience noticeable improvements in our health and physique. Andrea is the perfect trainer. She really cares about you and designs workouts specific to your body type. Her personality and enthusiasm make even the toughest workouts fun. She is the best trainer I have worked with. She deserves more than 5 stars.

Do not work with PODS. I had a horrible experience with this company. Long story short they delivered the pod outside of the specified time limit and parked it in the wrong place which happened to block my garage. Ended up having to pay a hundred dollar cancelation fee for something that was not delivered where it was supposed to be or at the time it was supposed to arrive. Use mobile mini storage instead. Much much cheaper.
