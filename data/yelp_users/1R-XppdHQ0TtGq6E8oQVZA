My fianc√©e and I came in a whim one night. We had both had a long week at work and grabbed a drink at another bar first and then randomly decided to mosey on over after doing a little shopping. The only time I had been to a TB was two years ago in Hawaii so that is really all I had to compare it to and I was not let down. From before we even walked in we could hear the relaxing live music coming from the downstairs patio. We were greeted immediately by the welcoming host and we informed him we wanted to grab some drinks from upstairs and sit on the balcony. Shortly after we took our seats our friendly waitress, Jaymi, was on point from the get go. Even though we weren't dining that night she was not reserving any attention from us. By the end of it we were singing praises to the manager, Chad, (who was very nice as well) about our great experience that night. We actually enjoyed it so much that we went back on Saturday night for dinner with the family. Now that a couple of weeks have gone by we actually received an unexpected post card (which is pretty humorous considering we live less than 3 miles away) from our server. Overall, the service is top notch here and we will continue to visit!!

Great hot dog and chicken panini to-go!! Couldn't wait to write a review before I ate my chocolate-chocolate chip cookie.

To start out I would like to say i used to LOVE this place. When I went to ASU I would come here all the time, lunch or dinner. Once I moved away from Tempe I would make sure to stop in to grab Togo food if I was ever in the area. My past few experiences have really let me down though. I have ordered food for take out and dinned in and the service has been slow and something with the order each time has been off or completely wrong. In my most recent experience we called in and they took our order. During the call they guy who took the order kept saying he needed to go somewhere quiet because he could not hear me. I assumed they were busy as it is dinner time. After driving to mill and paying for parking I walked in and the place was dead with some dub step blasting. There was one guy closing out at the bar who was wearing another local bar's shirt. So I would assume that they had plenty of time to make things perfect. When I go to pay the guy tells me that my wife's sandwich is no longer on the menu but they made it as close as possible as they could...mind you this is the menu posted on their website. I don't think much of it... Pay for my meal and give a more than generous tip for what is to come. Our appetizer was missing 2 of the 3 things that made it whole. My soup was like water and cold. It was supposed to be hot broccoli cheddar soup. My croissant was flattened and the avocado was brown. My wife's sandwich was with the wrong meat than what should have been on the sandwich we ordered...remember I placed the order over the phone and should have been alerted right then that they no longer carry it and direct me to where I could locate their updated menu or suggested a similar alternative...just a thought. This will be the last time I go here. This is pretty much what it has been like consistently the past few times I have been here. With so many other options on mill and in the general area, I know I can spend my time and money in a better place and I would suggest you do too!

I'd like to amend my last review because I just saw they were on the local news for having 6 health code violations one being no soap in the hand washing station and the other for keeping food past the expiration date...just saying.

This is one of my favorite places in the valley. This is where you can relax, play, and exercise. When there is a big event or holiday, there is always something going on down here. If you could only get in the water, then it would have 5 stars but with it being so close to the university I can understand the risk management.

They only reason I give the place 4 instead of 5 is because we made a reservation the day before so we wouldnt have the 45 minute Friday night wait and when my group showed up...surprise...our reservation wasn't saved because they don't do reservations for less than 6 people (confusing because thats not what the person said who took our reservation the day before).  Even with the wait though, we all seemed to enjoy ourselves. We started with the "lobstah" mac & cheese and some brie sandwiches to kick it off. Then we also ordered Vovo's favorite which changes daily and were pleasantly surprised with the ribs and potatoes. However the best part of our meal were the chicken and waffles, sooooo delicious!! I will definitely come here again!
