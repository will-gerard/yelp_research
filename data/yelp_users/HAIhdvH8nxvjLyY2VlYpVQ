We drive from Scottsdale just to have Juan's food!  If you are looking for 5 star atmosphere, not here, but if you are looking for 5 star food.  You are in the right place!!!  This Phoenix restaurant is family owned - Mom runs the kitchen, daughters run front of house with mom and dad and the brother run back of house (except for the cooking) and the register.  Once they know you, it feels like you are part of the family!

Took my mom here after she broke her toe. They ignored my request to monitor her blood sugar and blood pressure because she has problems with both. They provided no food even though my mother was in there for hours and her blood sugar was out of control by the time we left.   They put the craziest splint on her leg and said that she would have to have a wheelchair to get around. Took her back to the house and she was unable to do pretty much anything. In mad frustration I ran her Scottsdale Healthcare Center on Osborne.   If you ever have to see the doctor in an emergency situation avoid John C Lincoln at all costs!  Everyone that I know who has ever had to go to this hospital has had a horrible experience!  I honestly don't know how there's not more litigation against these guys!

I like Walgreens. It's not just because it's close and convenient, but the staffing pharmacists are also very helpful and nice.  I mean the cosmetic gals actually find coupons for you!    It's also really cool because you can drop off your prescription, get your shopping done and pick up your prescriptions all-in-one stop.

Went here with a girlfriend and we sat out on the terrace overlooking the golf course and The Awatukee foothills. It was a delight.   We had a couple of different wines and shared a cheese tray. The wines were yummy and the cheese tray was fresh.   The bartender was a gem and she was very knowledgeable about the wine selection.  Everything was very clean including the restrooms, which as we all know is a direct indicator as to what you could expect in the kitchen.   My only comment was the odor of fresh construction in the building but when I inquired about that they said that the wine bar had been there for years and there was no recent construction.

I like Arizona mills on weekdays. There are way fewer people still have all of the conveniences.   Today I went in for a screen replacement on my iPhone 5 S. It was only $110 to replace it and I got tempered glass to cover my new screen and that was only $25. So the whole thing ended up to be less than my deductible at Sprint to get the screen replaced.   While I was waiting I ran down to Ross and got some more activewear. I also got a dog walk in!  Next time I'm in a do a lap in there and see what the distances is.  You can go shopping buy clothes, get your screen fixed, get $25 Egyptian cotton sheets, get your exercise, have lunch, have a mani/pedi and sneak a moving in!

Went in 20 minutes before closing and it was very clear that they wanted to get me in and out. I had a splinter deeply lodged in my thumb and the physicians assistant or whoever it was looked at me like a deer in  headlights.    She said that I needed a specialist because they were ligaments in the fingers. The splinter was in the tip of my thumb and simply needed to be lanced open. Clearly this simple procedure was far beyond the anabiotic's and painkiller cookie-cutter response that fast med is capable of.   In my frustration of her inability to perform a simple procedure I said, "So basically I've wasted $25."  Her response was absolutely unbelievable stating, "Pretty much."  For real?  A healthcare professional's response was "Pretty much you wasted $25 coming to see me!!!!"  Wow???  If you have anything beyond a cold, the flu, strep throat and the like, don't waste your time go straight to the emergency room FastMed is useless!

Da Vang is one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in three states!  I cannot remember my faves in CA or NV right now, but when I remember them I will rate them too.  Anyway, if you are a Pho fan, their Pho (pronounced fuh) is the best with all of the goodies including peppers, lime, basil and sprouts that are really fresh!  I always get the chicken and my boyfriend always gets the shrimp, both are incredible!  We also always get the fresh spring rolls.  I could eat those until I explode!

My mom broke her toe and I originally took her to John C Lincoln. After returning home and realizing what an atrocious situation they dismissed her in, I ran her to Scottsdale Healthcare.   We were admitted and we're back to see the doctor in short order. They listen to my story and frustration of the previous experience and what a horrible situation she was in, unable to walk because of that retarded splint they put on her!   Once the doctor looked her over so she was going to be okay, they put a walking boot on her.  Now equipped with the proper solution she was able to walk around like a normal person and did not require hospice care!  I love this hospital and their staff!  All of my nieces and nephews were born here and I have only ever receive the very best of care!  If you have require hospital care this is the one to go to!

Really good food!  One day I was out front of Fresh-n-Easy and I smelled some really good smells!  I looked around and saw Tottie's.  Two days later I still could not get it out of my head so I invited my mom for lunch.  We shared Pad Thai and Panang Chicken.  I like food really hot so we got medium for my mom.  Even medium was a bit mild, but it was really good food.  The lunch special came with hot and sour soup and rice.  The hot and sour soup was different that what I was used to, but it was sooooo good I went back the next day for a large take out.  it was even more amazing the second time!!!

I have been a patron for YEARS!  There is no better sushi in Scottsdale. Their fish is as fresh as it gets, they are wonderful people and when we walk in the door, they know where to look at the sushi bar to see if our spots are available...unless Lisa is working at the bar, then we eat there!

If you are a veg head ( I am most of the time, but breakdown every-so-often), this is the place for you!  You have got to have the hummus!  They have some of the best hummus ever.  They specialize in vegan food and even if you don't like vegan food, you have to try this place...you just might change your mind.  I had my sister and the kids get some take-out and the kids were not going to like it not matter what.  They loved it!  So even if you are an exclusive carnivore, give it a shot!  You might find a whole new kind of food to love!

Tasty good stuff!  Portions large enough two can share an appetizer and leave happy campers.  Margaritas are great and the guacamole is to die for.  Salsa has a strange flavor I was not a fan of but my boyfriend loved it.  Staff is nice and really fun.  If you are looking for some unique Mexican food in Tempe Mucho Gusto is muy bien.

Meh. Won't be going back. Check out photos with comments. A bit worried about the quality of the food I just consumed. Praying to the food gods I don't get sick.    Ugh can't get the wet dog smell out of my head. Really?  Have to nuke a piece of nearly paper thin chicken to reheat?  And thinking about it the miso was watery as was the thin, strangely colored teriyaki sauce!   $32 lunch ... What a waste!  Final note:  Parents who let their children run around restaurants yelling deserve to have to pay the tabs of those around them the inconvenience. I mean really. Why is it the world's responsibility to raise your children...you should be banned from spreading your DNA!

I have been a patron of Trader Joe's since the early 90s and I just can't get enough (Depeche Mode playing in background). I'm not a huge fan of eating frozen food but Trader Joe's provides some of the best options available.  I love their wine selection and you really can't beat two Buck Chuck but should really be called three Buck Chuck. They also have great juices.  I prefer the one hundred percent cranberry over other cranberry juices because I can can mix with other juices how I like.   Trader Joe's also has a great selection of produce that while most of it is prepackaged is still quite good quality.  Prepackaged and good-quality can seems like an oxymoron but I'm sure you understand.    The health and beauty section is very small it is chock-full of good options such as Tom's deodorant.  They got rid of the lavender oil but they still have the lavender soap which is an absolute favorite mine!

A little smaller than some Petsmart but very clean and very nice staff. Everyone was very friendly and very helpful. When I pointed out a fish was suffering they immediately removed the poor little guy out of the tank. All of the tanks were extremely well-maintained.   In addition, they were having an adoption going on for puppies and so that was pretty cute.  Definitely a great store and I will be back.

Kobe's become one of our favorite sushi hang outs in Ahwatukee. Happy hour specials are really good and six dollar sake bombers are the bomb.   We have a spot we always sit in at the sushi bar and we always have the same couple of waitresses. They are knowledgeable, fast and very courteous.   They have a Teppan-Yaki area that we have never gone to yet but appears to be very popular!  Have a great birthday song.  If you're looking for a local happy hour that's good definitely hit up Kobe.

Safeway may be on the expensive side of grocery stores but I've been shopping here for years. This particular Safeway's produce department is not the best!  So if you're looking for good produce head off to Sprouts.  Other than that the deli department is good and I really like the floral department as well.  Some of the cashiers really crack me up and normally it's pretty good experience with those guys.   I am an anti-bag person and I think it confuses the cashiers and baggers. If I forget my bags in the car I typically just want to put everything back into the cart so that I can use my bags that are inconveniently in the car. So that typically generate some pretty funny looks but they have good humor about it!  If you ever need to return something customer service is very friendly and helpful which is nice. Overall a good Safeway.

The first time I ate here I had a veggie burrito and it was really good.  Living close by I thought I found the perfect spot for a good morning burrito.  The past few times that I've been here not only does the Burrito continue to get smaller and smaller and shorter but the quality of the contents are tasteless.   For the veggie burrito you basically you get a burrito with barely cooked rice a little bit of sour cream and a smudge of guacamole.  We also got a breakfast burrito of potatoes eggs and cheese.  The potatoes were dry the eggs were dry and the cheese sparse.  And again the red salsa had too much cinnamon in it.  And finally the temperature was nearly unbearable. I watched people as they entered the building fanning themselves because the temperature was so unbearable and this was at 8 o'clock in the morning.   I'm sure will be back again because we live so close but it's just not going to be my fave.

Normally you get two to go salsas for each item that you purchase.  Ordered two burritos to go and got two baby salsas and then was charged $.70 for two extras!

Second time to visit and the veggie burrito was pretty tasty!  I like the salsa bar each of the salsas has a very unique flavor.  TVs up kind of loud and doesn't get very good reception so it breaks up quite a bit,  which can be irritating.  Overall for a Taqueria pretty good all-around: nice environment, nice staff, excellent food.  Will definitely be back!

This place is great because you not only get to let the pups run, but you can run with them too. After the formal dog off the leash run about, I take the guys to the fields (on leashes of course) and run with them. It's great fun and good exercise!

I do not want to under rate by putting too few stars, but if I were going to, I would give a single star.  When I first started ordering here we always had our pizza on time or in less time than stated.  The one previous time they lost my order they gave it to us for free due to the inconvenience.  Lately the phone service has suffered and pizzas getting later and later.  Last time I ordered they called me an hour later and said they had lost my order again.  They were going to give a 10% discount.  I called back a few minutes later and said to skip it in disgust.  This is the best pizza since New York Pizza on Flamingo Rd in Las Vegas back in the 80s, but the service just ruins it!  Charging extra to swap ingredients is sad and forgetting someone's order for an hour is even worse!!!

If you love coconut shrimp please avoid the Sandbar. Is like eating a donut. There is no shrimp flavor in this sweet sauce shite cake battered, think it may be shrimp proto-meat?  And what is with the sugar sauce?  I do like the black beans. Scotty's fish tacos are okay. A bit dry.    Sorry about the skrimp left-over pic. Just to show what a tragedy.  Sweet beers..no good IPA.

They don't have pitchers of beer but they have really big draft on tap!  Friday fish fry is actually really good. Canadian white fish fried to perfection with really good crunchy french fries. The coleslaw is sweet, runny, mayonnaise-y.  Not my kind of coleslaw.    Local neighborhood bar where you expect to hear everyone to shout "Norm!" when the door opens because it seems like everyone is a regular. Older crowd so none of that youthful shenanigans.  A great place to watch a game.

My boyfriend and I got the falafel sandwiches with fries for dinner.  I was not a fan of the fries, but it was the best falafel sandwich I have had in the States!  The owner came out while we were eating and told us about the history of the restaurant.  It was great fun and really cool to chat with him.  When you go be sure to get the whole story for yourself!

$18 adjustments, no appointment required!  Time your visit because he is really good and an all around nice person so he is in demand and there can be a wait.    The wait is worth it!  I woke up yesterday and could not move my neck. I wore a perpetual wince on my mug because I was in so much pain.   In one adjustment and a good stretching I am doing much, much better in less than 24-hours. AND I drove 20 miles one way to get the adjustment!

I love this place!  I've been three months in a row and two of the three massages were absolutely stellar.  The first two massages were excellent because the therapist could find the exact muscles when you said my shoulders are are in pain they went right into the problem areas and were able to work those muscles out.  My last massage was more of, how do I describe it?  Overall not so good.  The nice thing is they keep the therapists' names on file so when I called just now to schedule my next appointment they scheduled me with the Second therapist I went to who was absolutely insanely good!!!

Judging by the cars in the parking lot I had already guessed the patron demographic and I was not let down. Upon entering we were promptly greeted by a very very sweet woman rest of the staff followed in kind.  Quaint does not even begin to describe Biscuits. While waiting in the lobby to be seated you sit on haystacks surrounded by cute kitschy stuff you might have seen at your grandma's house.  Once seated we requested coffee and were served the typical watered-down diner type coffee. I ordered my typical cheese omelette with hash browns and got a decent omelette it was okay.  I don't think that omelettes are the primary entree for this restaurant.   I do believe the name says it all. I'm not a toast and biscuit type person but my husband is. He absolutely could not say enough good things about the biscuits.

Having lived in the area for some time and looking to try something new, we walked past at first after briefly looking at the menu.   We returned after talking to a few people giving rave reviews.  Very happy we did because it ended up being a wonderful experience from greeting (actually opened a few minutes before 3pm for us) to excellent service and drinks, with the finally, wonderful fresh foods.  We will be back!!!

We have been here several times now and it is not as hot as you may think...but, if you don't like hot food don't go even though service is good, ambiance quaint and servers are most likely family of mama Chef.   Food is quite good. I understand meat dishes are incredible, but we stick to more vegetarian fare. The beans (yes have Manteca) are to die for and the guacamole is pretty darn tasty!  If you like spicy, drop in for a bite!

We have been waiting for this all year.   We're actually able to sit on the patio enjoying a lovely Sunday brunch.    After yesterday's storm burst from the weather cell out of the Gulf of Mexico, the temperature is absolutely gorgeous here in the valley!  This is what it is to live in Phoenix!  Spent the morning pulling weeds and transplanting mesquite trees to work up a hearty appetite for some yummy Mexican food.  Ordered my usual bean and cheese Burrito and consider doing enchilada style but meh went sans extra sauce to enjoy the amazing salsa!  I had the bean and cheese burrito Scott had the guacamole tostada and both were simply scrumptious.  Halfway through I kept telling Scott, "I'm full, I'm full." No matter how full I got, I just kept eating!  Looking for a relaxing, Sunday brunch with chips & beer?  Los Dos Molinos is the place to be!

Just the worst service!  I haven't even made it into receive service yet. Made an appointment for Saturday around three and at 12:30 they called and said had to up my appointment to one!  I mean who does that?  Couldn't make the 1 o'clock appointment so try to reschedule but they were not very accommodating and had another appointment a month out. So they put me on an on-call list and I have never been called to reschedule.   Calling now to try to reschedule will provide more details as the story develops.

This place is great!  There are a few different doctors that are just friends and every single one of themis absolutely amazing.   As with all joints there's rarely a week and if there is typically very short. Parking can be somewhat of a beast at lunchtime, it's really convenient because chipotle and smash burger are literally right next door.

Water boiled bagels are the only way to go and these bagels hit the mark. I would definitely go more often if there was more of a selection at a bit more competitive price.   We're from Santa Cruz and Scott actually used to be the baker at the Bagelry so I've had some pretty epic bagels.  In addition at the Begalry they had so many different kinds of schmeers, my favorites being hummus and egg salad on garlic.  It would also be cool if there was a nice rich sun-dried tomato schmeer.

An accident 19 years ago has left a chronic neck problem that causes numbness in my fingers, eye pain and severe neck pain.  Went in for an adjustment and with great care the doctor relieved my ailments with pressure to stressed muscles and a few minor adjustments that have taken away the inability to move my head to the left and an ongoing headache.    I am very happy to say I am in no pain right now and am looking forward to regular treatments. THANK YOU!!!   Next morning:  I woke up in no pain for the first time in weeks!!!!!  Thank you Dr Tom!

This place is great!  Sprouts has got organic produce, organic meats, a really really nice deli bar and doesn't break the bank like some of it's competitors.    They used to be a store chain here in the Valley called Sunflower that I like even better for prices and small-town feel, but Sprouts bought it up.  Smart for Sprouts but sad for those of us who loved Sunflower.  At Sprouts you always find the staff to be extremely helpful.  I've always had very positive interactions with everyone from asking produce guy questions to cashiers being extremely helpful providing courtesy ice for meats and cheese.

Really nice staff and close by make this an ideal restaurant for us, but we are still looking for a better local spot. Having lived on the ocean for so many years our sushi palette is hard to please in the desert. We did give it another try. Glad we did.   Prices getting more reasonable and that's a good thing!  Saki bomber used to be $11 each. Now you can get one and a $.99 extra beer. The saki is large so sharing is reasonable!  Sushi is also more reasonable than before and the fish is better quality than other sushi restaurants in the area.  We also tried their soup last night.  Definitely worth going back for.

Have not ever seen the Dr, just the PA and I must say Hanne Maturo is excellent and thorough.  I had my wellness exam and she covered everything including all blood work.   Previous posts are correct about time!  Call in advance to see if they are running behind. Once you get there, let them know you are busy and have scheduled for a set time. The staff is very nice and does their best to accommodate.   The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is due to the delays not due to Hanne Maturo.

Oh what can I say about Uncle Bears?  Beer is great and they let you have dogs on the patio!!!  Any restaurant that allows dogs on their patio is thumbs up with me.   My favorite are all of the pictures of dogs throughout the restaurant. Some of the dogs are so cute it's hard to describe it.   Sometimes it seems like the french fries are cooked in oil that is slightly under temperature so they are greasy and soggy.  They have great happy hour specials and other than soggy french fries foods pretty good.   Only been there a few times so far and every time the servers have been absolutely just the biggest dolls on the planet. Fun place to go to have local craft beer, hang out with your pups and maybe even catch a game!

I am giving two stars because the staff was nice, misinformed, but nice.   This is the second time I have tried to get an x-ray and have been given grossly inaccurate time estimates!!!    I called before I drove here and was told there was a 15 min wait. I re-confirmed when I got here. I had to wait 45 min.   DO NOT TRUST THEIR TIME ESTIMATES. If you are not retired or independently wealthy and have a schedule to follow be sure to quadruple any times they provide to possibly be on time to your other obligations!

I really like this place. When you walk in you enter a large, warmly lit room with a bar lounge area to the left and the dining area to the right.   This is our second time here and a super friendly :-) guy greeted us at the door. He was the owner and a wealth of information. Have some pretty cool beers on tap so if you're beer lover worth a try!  Today I tried the McManis Malbec red. Very hardy an actually worked with the Greekadilla!  The Harvest sandwich came with sweet potato fries. WOW. So good.   We will happily be back and soon I hope.
