They are very consistent and fast....always greet at the door and makes sure are taken care right away...my suggestion would be to make an appointment first if you can....I usually do not do a walk in...at times they can be very busy....ask for Kim or ken if you want beautiful toes and nails now Tracy's Nails!!!

First time we went had a pleasant experience for lunch...purchased a groupon on February 2nd and arrived with six adults...we called ahead, figuring they would be busy, but they wouldn't set a table aside...after waiting an hour and a half we came to the conclusion that they weren't going to seat us so we left....we came back tonight to give them a second chance to make things right....we called ahead nice again explaining what happened two weeks prior but again they would not accommodate us....we arrived and was greeted by a pleasant host at the door and was seated immediately, we told him what happened two weeks ago and he was very apologetic......a pleasant server took our drink orders....then the owner came out from back of the house and aggressively approached our table and was upset that we told his host that they didn't seat us the two weeks prior...that it wasn't his fault...and there was nothing he could do even though I mentioned to him we observed four 4 tops being seated even though they arrived after us...We once again left without being served......the owner is clearly inexperienced and unprofessional....he would have been better off keeping his mouth shut and allowing his pleasant server take care of business and we probably would have enjoyed our evening..,,but he wanted to make his point to us that our last visit was not his fault...and that we made him feel bad....well, I ask, who's fault was it??!! Mine??

Without a doubt the best Ruben I have ever had! Chunks of corned beef roast homemade 1000 island dressing and top notch marble rye..... I would come to this restaurant to have the Ruben again... Came here a couple of weeks ago and has breakfast....eggs benny with house made hollandaise served on crispy potato cakes...great call!! What a Hidden little gem....I've seen some of The cry baby reviews and my experience was the exact opposite....as an Executive Chef I know Good food and good service...I give this place 5 stars for my two visits
