Love this place been going here for 10 or so years it looks scary from the outside but give it a chance the owners remember everyone that is a repeat customer they remember if you want spicy mustard or not the food is great I have only ever had the buffet

Like one of the other guys said if you show up at 8 when they say they open they're not going to be open.  I have been here quite a few times and never had a problem like some of the other people.

Won't ever go here again.  The appetizers were really good, nacho, bruschetta and onion rings.  My burger was ok but the bacon was raw.  The fries had to many crammed in a basket so there were some that were crispy and most weren't.  The majority of them were not fully cooked inside.    Our server was so bad we went in at 645 (with 2 children age 2 and under) and left at 830. There were only 4 other tables in there on a Monday night.  Common sense tells you that a table with small children will most likely want to leave shortly after finishing but no, after clearing half the plates she disappeared for another 15 minutes. Then it took what felt like another 10 minutes for her to return with the checks!
