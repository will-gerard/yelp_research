Every time I have been to this location, the service is extremely slow and they seem unorganized. The last two times in particular, I've sat in my car almost ten minutes waiting for them to vacuum the car in front of me. And then when they finish, the car sits there several minutes before it's driven away to be washed. In not sure if this is just bad luck or what, but it feels like 3 cars go through for every one car in my lane.

My wife and I went here on a Monday, April 2nd for our one year anniversary.  The reviews we've read definitely made this place seem like a winner.  I made a reservation for 6:30, just shortly after the restaurant opens.  The drive up the mountain was steep but the resort is beautiful and you could just tell that the view at the top would be amazing.  Were we ever surprised!  The valet parked my car and we went inside to be seated.  Unfortunately the patio wasn't open for service but they sat us by the window so we had a great view of downtown Phoenix.  One complaint we did have about our table was that it felt like we were in the path of all the server traffic.  It was also right next to a door to the patio so a couple of people tried to come in and out but the door was locked, so that was a little distracting.    Our server, Lenny I believe was his name, was very friendly and informative.  There were so many people that came to our table giving us water refills and bread and clearing our plates.  Lenny helped me pair a wine with my dinner.  My wife ordered the duck ravioli as an appetizer and I had the lobster bisque.  The lobster bisque was phenomenal, every bit as good as the previous yelpers have proclaimed.  And the duck raviolis were excellent as well.  The ravioli was cooked perfectly, just aldente enough so that it had a nice chew, the way I like my pasta cooked.  For dinner, my wife had the lobster and prosciutto wrapped prawns.  Both were so flavorful because they were braised in butter, which adds flavor every time.  I had the scallops over a bed of rainbow cauliflower and some sauce.  The sauce was a little too citrusy  for me and the scallops were almost better without it.  There were also a couple pieces of black garlic, which I forgot was in the dish.  So when I took a bite of one not knowing what it was, that sent my mouth into shock and I immediately had to wash it down with water.  Minus that, both dishes were very good.  After dinner, we walked out onto the patio and down to the bar section to take some pictures with the city in the background.  The weather was amazing and we were so lucky to have the cityscape as our backdrop.  Dinner was a little pricey but I was glad we could share a fancy dinner on a special occasion.

This place is always amazing, every time I go.  The burrata is to die for and I order it as soon as I sit down.  If you don't get there semi early though, they typically run out by 6 or 7 on Fridays and Saturdays.  All of the pizzas I've had are super tasty, with local ingredients for toppings.  My favorite has to be the Diavolo with ricotta.  The salami has a nice spicy kick and the ricotta balances it out nicely.  Its a little warm during the summer, as most of the seating is outside.  But once the sun goes down and they turn on the decorative lighting, you forget you're in downtown Phoenix.  I'd recommend this place over Pizzeria Bianco anytime.  Half the wait and twice as good.

My fiancee and I took a leap of faith after reading some of the reviews here on Yelp.  Although she likes sushi, she's never been much of a fish person.  Crudo I've learned means "raw" in Italian.  After ordering two of the Crudo plates (Tuna and Albacore) I think she's finally come around.  Both plates were full of flavor and the textures were extremely complimentary.  We also had the Gnocchi, which was delicious and the Veal, which was over goat cheese polenta.  I can almost definitively say that the Veal was the most tender and flavorful piece of meat I have ever eaten.  The chefs were also kind enough to tempt our taste buds at the start of the meal by serving us a small piece of local watermelon in a squid ink sauce, topped with fresh herbs.  I'm not sure if I was the biggest fan but I love trying new things and I can now check squid ink off my list.  All of the food was so fresh, as they used a lot of produce and dairy from local farmers.  The trick is definitely to go on Fridays.  50% off all bottles of wine.  How many higher end restaurants do you know that run those type of specials on a normally busy night?  The bill was a little pricey in the end but it was worth the three hours spent with my lovely bride to be.

Came home at 5 today to a 88 degree house. Since I've had numerous AC problems in the past, I was less than thrilled to have another. I immediately jumped on Yelp to find a local AC repair service in my area. And that's when I found AC Doctors.  I called them up and immediately set an appointment for same day service. Frank and his assistant showed up at 745 and immediately diagnosed the problem. Some wiring outside had fried and needed to be replaced. An hour later, as I'm posting this review, my house is cooling and I'll be able to sleep comfortably tonight.  Frank gave it to me straight and said that two components would need to eventually be replaced sometime in the near future. But he didn't try to sell me, or scare me into making a decision. He even emailed me a copy of the invoice with his recommendations in case I need to reference them in the future. If I have an AC issue again, I won't hesitate to call AC Doctors!

A/C went out late Saturday night and Home Warranty wouldn't schedule someone right away. They had to process my claim first and then send out a technician. Long story short, technician finally called at 9AM, saying they couldn't come until Monday sometime. That doesn't work when it's predicted to be 120. In come A/C Doctors. Called and was able to schedule a technician to come out between 10 and 1. Got a call at 10:30 that they were in the neighborhood and could be there in a few minutes. Service was quick and when you desperately need A/C, price isn't really a concern. All in all, I'm very happy with the entire transaction. Would definitely call them again on short notice as they are very responsive.

I saw this place about a month ago on my first trip to Chino Bandido (which btw is totally overrated and the food isn't that great). But enough about Chino, this review is about good food at Good Fellas. My wife and I were looking for something different and for a reasonable price. We found Good Fellas and the reviews were great so we thought we'd try it out. Were we ever impressed!  The owner, if you haven't read, is a great guy, extremely personable and wants to make sure you are satisfied with your dining experience. He suggested a couple of dishes and we ordered them. My wife had the Chicken Sandwich and I had the 2 Meat Platter. We also ordered the hummus, which came with a side of hot pita. The owner, Ninos, gave us a complimentary bowl of soup with our order.  I thought they were both tasty but I preferred the chicken and potato curry over the lentil.  The hummus was fresh and full of flavor.  When our food arrived, I couldn't believe how much food there was. A heaping mound of rice, a twelve inch piece of grilled beef and 6 or 7 hunks of chicken.  After the soup and hummus, I felt myself slowing down early and I'm usually a big eater.  The food was so flavorful and the portions were awesome for the price you pay.  Our meal was right around $22 and was some of the best money I've spent on food in a while.  I'll definitely be heading back for good food at Good Fellas soon.

I love sushi...Who am I kidding? I love food!  But sushi is towards the top of my list when I'm deciding where to go to dinner.  So when I searched for new sushi places near me, I found Nori.  The reviews seemed good, and the recommendations were right up my alley.  Had a little trouble finding the place, since the address directs you basically to  Desert Ridge Marketplace, but to the corner of Deer Valley and Tatum.  Ended up calling them after driving around for 5 minutes without having a clue where to go.  When we got there, the patio had a couple tables open and the inside was half full, so we decided to sit outside.    I took advantage of the check-in free edamame and we looked over the menu.  I love tuna poke so the tuna poke roll was a must have, along with the softshell crab appetizer and another of their specialty rolls.  The server was incredibly nice and attentive.  She came by several times to fill up our water, and make sure we didn't need anything else.  I'd give that part of the experience 5 stars.  Now for the food.  The tuna poke roll had crushed Doritos on it, which was an unnecessary addition.  Plus they were stale and just stole from the taste of the fish.  The softshell crab, which I've had at other sushi restaurants, was bland and the mango salsa it came with was hardly salsa at all.  It was more a salad, sans lettuce.  Just large chunks of cucumber, tomato, mango, and red onion that had very little flavor.    I think the biggest reason I gave this place only 2 stars was the price.  We had two rolls and an appetizer, without drinks, and walked out of the place for $50 after tip.  Hardly the price point I search for when it comes to so-so food.  Unfortunately, I don't see myself coming back to this place.

Great donuts.  Had the maple glaze with bacon.  Delicious obviously...it has bacon; can I say anymore?  I eat donuts about once a year but this place will definitely be on my list to go back to if I ever get a craving again.
