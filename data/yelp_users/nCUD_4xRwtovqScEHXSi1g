I have been suffering from Systemic Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis since I was 14 months old and have been doing physical therapy ever since. I am now 33 and let me tell you I know a great physical therapy practice when I go to it. This, by far, is the BEST facility I have been to since my time in San Francisco. Blair is the physical therapist assigned to me for my post procedure therapy after having a Total Hip Replacment and I feel like I won the lottery! He is outstanding!!!! From day one he and the entire crew at Physiotherapy have been so attentive, knowledgeable, and encouraging. The exercises have been so fitting for my road to recovery. I am never over pushed, but challenged just enough to keep me improving. Although I pray I am done with surgeries, since this has been my 6th joint replacement, I am happy to know I have finally found my forever physical therapy clinic if need-be.

I have been suffering with Systemic Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis since I was 14 months old and have seen quite a few Rheumatologist in my day. I am so blessed to have found Dr. Rizzo almost 11 years ago. Since basically my entire life has been dealing with this awful disease I have experienced many types of doctors. There is nothing worse than going to a doctor and having to teach them about your condition or having them sugar coat everything so your feeling's are not hurt... Well Dr. Rizzo is truly one of the smartest doctors I have ever met! He also doesn't sugarcoat anything and tell's you like it truly is. Which honestly is the best for everyone! I know there are sensitive people out there and he probably isn't going to be the best doctor for you, but honestly I would just suck it up and see a doctor who going to tell you like it is and get you on the road to recovery or manageability. If you have arthritis you know how excruciating of a disease it is... so why would you want a doctor who is going to mislead you and/or give you false hope?! Dr. Rizzo is truly for his patients and finding them solutions to improve their lives. He has given me so much support through the years and truly made such an improvement in my health.   Oh and I can not finish this review without acknowledging Dr. Rizzo's awesome staff! Medical assistant, Ashley and Office Coordinator, Liza and the rest of the ladies are AMAZING!!! I truly look forward to my monthly visit's with this awesome crew.

Orange Table has been a favorite of mine for years and today I found out they delivered!! To say the least I was pretty darn excited. I ordered the Havarti Grilled Cheese and my business partner ordered the Green Chili Chicken Melt. The entire experience was perfect. The girl who took my order over the phone was so polite and professional and the time frame she gave for delivery was spot on. Our food arrived still hot and was packaged so cute. Our food was exceptional!!! It was my business partners first time having Orange Table and we were both oohing and aahing the entire time. Delish as always. This will definitely be our new go-to spot for lunch time deliveries.

I have been going to Flo's for years and every single time it is AMAZING! Whenever I have family or friends in town I always take them here and nobody is every disappointed. Not only is the food exceptional so is the customer service. Flo herself stops at every table and ask how your meal was... I seriously don't understand how every single time I have been there in all times of the day she has done this. By far one of my favorite places in AZ.

By far the WORST company I have ever dealt with. I wish I listened to my instincts because I should have known from the pushy, overdone sales pitch this was going to be a disaster. Not only did they not do what they promised, which was cleaning my brand new porcelain tile floors in my new spa they RUINED the new grout and all my baseboards! Once everything dried and I could really see the damage, which was just about 2hrs later, I called the company right away and when I complained and told them about all the damage I was basically told "That's to bad. Well I guess we can give you 10% off your NEXT service" NEXT SERVICE, are you KIDDING ME! So of course I asked to speak with a manager and of course I couldn't right away since this truly is the worst company ever and their "manager" didn't call me back for 2 day's! This so called "manager" then tried to argue with me and tell me how they were not going to refund any portion of their service and I should be happy with the 10% off next service offer! If any manager at my small business ever treated a customer like I was treated they would be fired. Since I clearly wasn't getting through to this "manager" I tried reaching out to the corporate office of Stanley Steemer which, surprise surprise didn't work and I never heard back from anyone then tried reaching out to the BBB and that didn't even work! Well thank goodness there is Yelp and if I can prevent just one person from making the mistake of hiring Stanley Steemer then I feel they are getting the karma they deserve.

This is my first review ever and I couldn't be more compelled to write one to spare anybody who is thinking of trying this place.   Two girlfriends and I  tried this place this past Saturday and not only was it the WORST FOOD ever it was also the WORST SERVICE. We ordered a bottle of wine and the pretzel for an appetizer then after 20min we were told our pretzel was given to someone else and that was the last one so they would like to substitute it for free. Then we ordered our main courses. I ordered the Ribbon Pasta with shrimp on the side and my friends ordered the steak salad. When our food arrived my friend's were brought JUST steaks, but since my pasta arrived at the same time my friends said they would just suck it up and eat the steaks. One bit of my Ribbon Pasta and I wanted to vomit! I had my friend try it to confirm and she completely agreed. Since my friends didn't even want actual steaks we decided it would be best to send it all back. The waiter that came over (Mike) was so amazing. He said No problem and would bring me something else off the menu and my friends what they actually ordered. 5min later the food runner came over and told me that "since nothing was actually wrong with your food we are going to have to charge you for both meals". I was in complete shock and immediately asked for the manager. 5min later she then comes back and told me "the manager does not want to come out and fight with me out here" when I responded with "nobody wants to fight I just want to address the issue so he needs to come out here and chat with me"  2min later she comes out and says "he will not come out and talk to you cause he does not want to fight". Proceeded to tell her I am going to make sure I write a review on yelp and he needs to chat with me now.   After that the Manager/Owner came to our table and tried to tell me that he never told the food runner to say those things to me. LIAR! Why would she say it twice. After explaining to him the issues he did nothing to really solve them. He just said he wouldn't charge us for the pretzel we never got! Really?!? I then told him I am not paying for food that we didn't even eat! He then left and sent our original waiter over with our check... They charged us for the French Fries appetizer and the bottle of wine. We quickly reminded him we didn't even want the french fries and that they were comping them because they gave the pretzel we did order to someone else.   So my friends and I paid for our wine. Since we split the check three ways the total was $11.27 and we all left a $2 tip. So the total that should have been charged would be $13.27... guess what I looked at my bank statement today and they charged me $27.27!!!!! OMG I am going back there today and demanding they fix this error!!

I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review about one of my favorite companies we use. Since opening my newest day spa a little less than a year ago we have been using Arizona Pest Squad. I found them on Yelp originally and I am so grateful I did.   My day spa is a few doors down from some restaurants and unfortunately that means bugs... Bugs and Spa's definitely don't go well together so since hiring Arizona Pest they have kept us bug free! They keep us on the perfect schedule so I don't even have to think about it and the spray they use leaves the shop with no odor and most importantly NOOOOO BUGS!! Arizona Pest Squad not only has a great product they have AMAZING customer service. Everyone I have ever spoken with and met has been so fun and personable. Exceptional service all around.

By far my FAVORITE nail salon!! Kelly is absolutely amazing at my gel manicures and my boyfriend won't go to anyone else for his pedicures. She and her husband, Kevin, are so entertaining all while being so detailed with their services. I am not picky with who does my pedicures and everyone there does an excellent job! We have been going to Luxury Nails for almost three years now and definitely would never go anywhere else. I am always sad when I go on vacations and have to go to a different salon. It's never the same. Fortunately once I am back in AZ Kelly always fixes me up!

5 Stars seriously is not enough! This company is amazing and was by far a perfect 10!! Last week when I woke up and went out to my garage I found my car with a flat tire. I completely started to panic since I had to be at TV segment for my business in just 2 hours!! So I am a typical girl and have no clue how to change a tire so I started to call around. I called about 5 different companies and everyone said it would be a 2 hour wait!? UMMMMM NO!!! So thank goodness I called Tow AZ and the guy who answered was sooooooo nice and said he understood my situation and would be to me in 25min. I seriously couldn't believe it and wanted to jump up and down with joy. Sure enough the nicest man arrived and had me fixed with my donut in less than 10 min. I really wish I could remember his name, but I know I will definitely ALWAYS use this company for any issues in the future. I am them saved in my phone forsure and you should too :)
