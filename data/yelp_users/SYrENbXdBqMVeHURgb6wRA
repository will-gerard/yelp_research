I have been to this place many times over the last 6 years(here visiting family) and I think because I'm so distracted with the view, the company, and the people watching I don't really notice that the service is sub par.  They are friendly, they are accurate and they are BUSY.  Food is always amazing! "Yay, I'm a fan"

This is literally the worst Chipotle I've ever been to.  I don't usually spend my time writing reviews for fast food places, but damn, this place is seriously the worst. Let me start by saying I LOVE Chipotle. It's my weakness. And this is the closest location to me, so naturally i come here to get my fix as quick as possible. Coming to this place takes up huge part of my day and usually ends up upsetting me or making me late.  1. These workers move so slow it's astonishing.  Like my mind is blown that no one there, INCLUDING the manager, has any sense of urgency whatsoever. And it also seems like there are never enough workers. Two people on that line is NOT ENOUGH. 2. They're always out of everything and do not have back ups ready. I seriously have waited 10 minutes for brown rice after they tried to just give me a half scoop of the old rice that was literally sticking to the tin. UM, HELL NO. 3. The steak is ALWAYS over cooked and tough.  Botton line: HURRY THE F*** UP and train your employees better!

This is always the "go to" place for me and friends.  Usually open late.  Bartenders are always knowledgeable of product and the chicken strips are to die for!  Go here for a good drink and awesome bar food.

I've been going here for about a year and have seen at least 5 different therapists.  All were GOOD, but CANDIE is the best.  She is so in-tuned with your bodies needs and where it's sensitive.  She listens and my body is very grateful for it!  Staff is always kind and hospitable!

Coming from out of town, but have Buca's in my home town, and I have to say, NOT IMPRESSED.  - Iffy service - Portions over the top - Drinks never refilled - Servers not knowledgeable AT ALL about their menu.  But this confirms that ALL the Buca di Beppo's suck.

Wow, what an amazing place to have some quiet time on Sunday.  truly relaxing.   2 quick tips though, just from being in the industry myself:  Make sure the person bringing the food knows what it is and if I'm wearing black, please bring me a black napkin; I don't want to have to ask for one by the time my food arrives. I also feel like their menu changes often?  I'm not 100% sure about that, but I had "favorite" there about a month ago and came back for it and my server had no idea what I was talking about.  I understand menu changes though, so no biggie, I guess.  Other than that the food is fantastic & the service is great!  HALF OFF ALL BOTTLES ON SUNDAY!

We here for my first time yesterday with my mother who has been several times and has nothing but good things to say.   1. SERVICE - everyone is extremely friendly and helpful, down to the super friendly valet!   2. The facility and grounds were so clean and smelled amazing. Great clean up crew :)   3. The rooftop pool was AMAZING. The pool was not overly chlorinated and it felt like there was water softener which made it so nice to swim in.   4. The whole experience was quiet and relaxing and my masseuse with Linda was great. She was friendly, considerate, and STRONG. :)

Wow. This place has impressed me to the fullest. Came in late night and we were still served by happy, friendly staff and manager. Food was amazing - a little pricey but, well worth it. Will be back!

I'm from Cali and been going to America's Tire Co. for 7+ years now and was excited when I saw a Discount Tire here in Scottsdale.   Same amazing prices and great knowledgeable staff. So quick and convenient!

Came here based on yelp reviews and a convenient location. Though a very small shop and not totally is easy to spot, it was exactly what I was looking for between available selection and knowledgeable staff.    I was given a ton of options on bikes based on where and why I would be riding it having my best interests, and price range, at heart.  Bought a bike through Kailen(sp?), upon recommendation, that was special ordered and received within 3 days!   When the bike arrive I was "fitted" properly for it so I was 100% comfortable riding it.  Great group of guys very knowledgeable and friendly. You get great prices and thorough service. Whether you want a casual bike or a high tech racing bike this place can supply anything you need. They genuinely want to make sure EVERYTHING is right for you before you leave here!

Seriously have never had a bad experience and I've been here at least 75 times. When to go: Lunch or Reverse Happy Hour What to get: Sapporo & Sake, Surfer, Tootsie, Hot Lips, and fresh sashimi.  The Sashimi Salad is REALLY good too.

Had the best experience here - absolutely no negatives!  We sat in the lounge/bar area and our server was super sweet and helpful since we had never been. Great recommendations on beer and food. I can't remember my sandwich now because this was a while ago(I live in extreme north Scottsdale) but it had a jalepe√±o aioli and it was TO DIE FOR. The fried chicken was really good too.  It is comfort food for sure! Wanting to return to try more things, asap.

I am REALLY particular about my hair, as I'm sure many are.  So when my mom and I moved here from Cali there was some extensive searching done for the right salon/stylist and this is the one!  They use GOLDWELL hair color (which is the best) and the stylists just know what they're doing.  I've been to Jennen for color - she did exactly what I needed done, more of a natural look without the big chunky highlights.  Lo (blond Lauren) did my hair cut - I didn't want a lot taken off, but my hair was dead.  She cut just enough to make my hair healthy and give me a fresh look and I love the styling techniques!  Morgan has done a style for me.  I showed her a picture and she exactly what I wanted!  AND the curls stayed for 2 days with hardly any hairspray, through sleep and basic everyday activities!  They also sell the complete line of Aveda makeup which is convenient for me! :)  Lucky find in the Summit Center next to Safeway and Pei Wei

This place never disappoints! The ladies are sweet and attentive, even when busy (it's all about communication). Food was great - I had the lobster salad. Also nice to have live music on a Tuesday :)

This place has managed to mess up my orders, and argue with me about it more times than not, and I feel like the balance between relaxed/friendly and unprofessional/rude needs to be reevaluated.  I come here because it's convenient.  But when there's a long line and your continuing to ignore me while I'm standing in front of you to order, because you're finishing up a convo with your co-worker and I'm late ... it's just is not a great way to start my morning.  1. Ordered 2 Dirty, Venti, Soy Chai's and usually just get get confirmation for one shot or they'll ask me and for some reason they decided I should have 2 shots in each ($18) And when I asked why they automatically gave me 2 shots, the blame game started among your employees. I was given a free drink coupon.  2. Ordered a Grande Soy Chai and received a Tall and when I inquired, the barista ripped it from the counter and poured it into a grande cup.  I said to the barista timidly, "I'll pay for it I was just sure I ordered a grande." Then the cashier, who must have over heard me, shouted over to me saying, "No you ordered a tall." I said, "$7 for a tall?" She said, "Yes."  -__-  As I was walking out with my shamed grande, the same cashier says, "Oh no! You did order a grande", whilst holding up a receipt that she went back and printed...."  I just walked out.  I expect a little more from Starbucks. I'll probably just go to Kierland from now on.

I love coming here after 9PM.  Such a fun atmosphere!  Food is always awesome! and the bartenders are even better.  They treat you like family and take care of you like family.  You're not just a customer here, you're a guest!

Creepiest place ever. Just had my first and last experience here. I have NO clue how they're in business. Starting with the fact that there's NO ONE in there ..bad sign number one.  Went here based on convenience and yelp ... Wasn't going to get biscuits and gravy so I could care less about that.  So, if you're iced tea tastes funny, I'm convinced you haven't had or passed a health inspection in a while. JUST SAYIN  I think the menu has some good ideas, however, execution is questionable and staff (mother daughter?) are weird as hell... I have flashbacks of the Hills Have Eyes. Pretty sure our waitress was on some sort or drug and literally made me want to spit my food out.  I'm giving this place 1 star because we had a waitress who took our order and the food and bill came out correctly.  I honestly feel bad for this place, but I also feel it's only fair to let people know my opinion and experience... YOU BE THE JUDGE, if you dare.

What a terrific find!  Located in the AJ's center this office provides a wide variety of treatments including permanent makeup.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  I got Botox from Dr. Soldo who is very professional, thorough, and timely.  Miss Karri Hayes (medical aesthetician) assisted him and did a wonderful job.  I recently moved from California and found the prices much more agreeable here.  Will definitely return and refer friends :)

Veggie un-wich with hot peppers and sprouts is what this girl is about (although they are a little too generous with the sprouts)! Delivery and ordering in, staff is always friendly, accommodating, and speedy.  I mean it's a sandwich shop-  my expectations include: making sandwich that doesn't take 15 minutes.   THEY WORK REALLY HARD BY THE WAY! Great Job guys and gals!

Review based on breakfast only: It was a decently busy morning I'd say, but 2 of us were seated and greeted right away. Our waitress was very sweet and friendly. Food came out quickly and was delicious! Eggs Benedict and an Egg White Omelet(sort of a custom order) were perfect!   The vibe in this place is clean, organized, and unique.   It's not a "cheap" place, but I firmly believe in: You get what you pay for. Highly recommended place for breakfast, at least, and I will be back!

Let me just say I was warned about the mediocre hair styles, but my own experience solely with customer service guarantee's that I'll never try again.  Convenient - yes Prices - reasonable Customer service - HORRID  I called to make an appointment, same day (the latest one available) at 6:15.  **First off just know when you're calling, you're not getting the salon you're getting some call center that makes appointments for you.**   SO, I knew I wouldn't make it there til about 6:25 because of my class schedule, so I decided to pop by and let them know I'd be a little late.  The receptionists reaction, was almost like "how dare you", and told me they closed promptly at 7 since they need the full 45 minutes.  My response to this was "so you just put down all styling tools and leave at 7?" ... no.  She informed me that she couldn't CHANGE the time of the appointment, but she'll put a note in letting the stylist know.  A few hours go by and I get a call from the salon.   "Hi this is [soandso] and I see that you can't make it here til 6:30, so did you want to reschedule?"   No I want a style tonight for a reason, you dumb broad...  and again reiterated my question of them just stopping what they're doing at 7 at the same time my mind is racking at why is this SUCHHHHH a big deal???   The phone call lasted about 3 minutes of me asking a question and her just repeating that they close at 7. Was a talking to a robot?? I was pissed, so I canceled and hung up.  My overall impression is that a fiery hair dragon comes at 7:01PM and if anyone is still working it will breathe fire destroying everything in site and that's scary.

First time here and I have no complaints! Food was timely and delicious! Enjoyed to curry today and look forward to trying more things on their menu. Loved the iced tea too - it's different and I'll have to ask why next time I'm there. Very affordable

REVIEW PURELY BASED ON HAPPY HOUR: WOW.  where do I begin??  1. amazing happy hour prices (drinks too!) DRAGON ROLL! $6 2. fast service 3. friendly staff 4. great music 5. overall perfect night.....  except for the random girl bringing us a round of sushi and just standing next to our table, without saying ONE WORD. Just looking at us.  Not saying what she has or anything normal.  It was weird.

Been here twice and disappointed both times.  Food is OK. Guac is over priced. Specialty cocktails way too sweet. Staff not very personable ... I would actually go as far as to say continuously weeded and awkward.  Went there a few nights ago with family and friends and we literally sat there and chatted for an hour before I finally made eye contact with our waitress like "HEY WE'RE READY". Just because we're talking doesn't mean we're not hungry.  She was running around all night just looking way too busy.  Tortilla soup tasteless. Ensalada Sol was good, but I could've made a better salad at home for half the price.. Want to add chipotle shrimp? Don't. Also tasteless and no spice at all.  Apparently the enchiladas and street tacos are good.  Also, the apparent manager reaches over our table to turn on the electric candle... Without saying a word. We all stop to look at him since we had no idea who he was and why he were reaching across the table turning on the candle and then walking away. Try something like "Hi! My name is soandso, and I'm the manager here. How are those margaritas?" ... While reaching for the candle. Or better yet, TURN THEM ALL ON BEFORE DINNER SERVICE ;)   Customer service isn't bad, just weird. Hostesses are friendly opening doors and what not, but when you mention its still happy hour you should give us happy hour menu's as well and there are tables near the door, hold off on the personal chitchat, because I don't care what you're doing later tonight.  ALL SUMMED UP: Food: overpriced (not saying it's totally bad, but it's OVERPRICED) Service: inexperienced staff and way too casual for The Quarter (use proper verbiage, make eye contact, and SMILE... advice applicable to everyone working there, except the young boy who always refilled my water :) Atmosphere: trendy.  I'll go to Chipotle next time.

This place is a joke. Trendy- yeah. Big deal. Service at the bar for brunch on a Sunday morning was literally shocking. Bartender didn't smile once, I swear. It was not busy at all, yet it took her 10 min to make us 4 mimosas and another 5 minutes for a bloody, because she was busy cleaning other glassware right in front of us.   Food took 35-40 minutes to get to us and was absolutely pathetic portion size wise and wasn't even that good! She never asked us how anything was and we all left there still hungry (and broke).   We were never offered refills on our "bottomless mimosas", had to ask every single time.  The only silver living is that a manager or just other co worker came over to us and was friendly and accommodating, since our check was wrong. I would never come back here ever again. There are so many other amazing places, especially for breakfast near this place. Don't waste your time or money!

I probably won't ever come back here again. The wait staff is seriously so uninterested. No genuine smiles and no sense of urgency. They have changed the salsa flight and got rid the chipotle salsa for 2 massive things of salsa and/or cheese and I literally don't even want to order anything else. Literally over this place. After enough below average experiences, just done with this place. It's too bad. Literally.

Ok, I've given this place another try. Seems they have changed they're menu a bit (for the better) and I actually had a great time. Food was great service was still just ok. I could answer more questions than the waiter about the items, including the wine. Go for the atmosphere and food

This place is amazing, even for non golfers! I'm not a golfer myself, but I have had the best time here with my friends. Food is great and drinks are inexpensive! Been here day and night - at night everything lights up and makes it even more awesome.  The only thing that annoyed me was the fans. I felt like I was in a never ending tornado, but eventually got the fan turned off, thank God. only $45/hour.

Detox Island Green or regular Island Green are awesome!  I get it without the added sugar (which is all natural), I just don't need it - the fruit is sweet enough for me.  Always friendly and fast in the mornings!  I order and go to Starbucks while I wait and keep the drink in the fridge and have it for lunch :)

I want to start off by saying I got my eyebrows done by Anita and I couldn't be happier! As someone who is very fair and has over plucked all these years, and spent at LEAST an 30 minutes putting on eyebrows everyday so I knew I was a good candidate for this.   I called for a consultation and they got me in that week.  Brittany did a wonderful job of analyzing exactly what kind of tattooing I would need with Anita's input. Three weeks later I'm in the chair getting prepped for tattooing... surprisingly not nervous at all. All my questions were answered and I felt 100% comfortable.  The results were even better than I had hoped! I get compliments on the daily and I am eternally grateful for the burden that has been lifted off  my shoulders!  Thank you so much Anita!  sidenote (and probably a given): Aftercare is SO important. Don't take shortcuts or get lazy!

Came here for the first time last Monday with my mother and we had an great time. We sat in the bar area around 4:30 just for drinks and a snack before we decided to have dinner. I had a pink grapefruit cocktail on their menu (two thumbs up) and then we shared the calamari and shrimp app which was different and delicious! For dinner we shared the 3-way Caprese, Short Rib Ravioli and Shrimp Tagliatelle.  All 3 were unique and full of flavor, but the Short Rib Rav was a MUST HAVE FOR SURE.   My only 2 suggestions: 1. Wines by the glass should be cooler. The ones we ordered were wayyyyy too warm. 2. I find it more pleasant to eat shrimp pasta without the tails.  The experience as a whole was phenomenal and we will be back to try more things!!

Came back to Spiga a few nights ago and sat outside.  Weather was perfect and so was the food.  Had the Spaghetti Amore which was unbelievable! ... The service this time was OK- our server didn't know the food or wine menu AT ALL.  He literally couldn't answer any of our questions.  I'll still come back and enjoy the food and wine, because it's so delicious.

Amazing new restaurant in Cave Creek.  It is very modern looking and expensive so I hope the get the clientele there are hoping for.  Waiter was great, service was great, drinks were great and the food was PHENOMENAL.  Out of the group of 7 of us I tried the Scallops, Lamb, Artichoke Pasta, Filet, and the Artichoke Pasta with Duck breast.  Didn't want the night the end we had such a great time - can't wait to come back and try the wine list
