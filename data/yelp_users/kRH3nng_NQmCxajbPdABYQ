Furniture selection (very modern) and customer service at the store was great!  Furniture delivery, on the other hand, was absolutely terrible. Ordered a leather sectional, which came unwrapped and uncovered. Upon inspection, noticed that the chaise piece was damaged (most likely when bringing it up the stairs). After sending the entire sectional back, the guys came back about an hour later with a new sectional. Again it came unwrapped. While trying to put the sofa and chaise pieces together, the delivery guy pushed into the side of the sofa and ripped it. Had to wait another week for the re-delivery, and finally, third time's the charm.   If possible, just pick up your furniture from their warehouse. Paid $70 for this delivery service, only for it to ruin my overall experience with the store.

Con you at the door by giving you a voucher for a "free slice". It's pretty much an 1/8th of a slice of pizza. What a joke
