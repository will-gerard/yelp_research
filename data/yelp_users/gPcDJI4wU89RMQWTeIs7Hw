I've been wanting to eat here since my last trip to Vegas. And I'm glad I did! It was just the same. I had the Twisted Mac N Cheese which was delicious and Darren had the fish n chips... Fantastic... The bruschetta was great... My salad I tried the pear dressing which was a bit odd but a bit good at the same time.. Good. Our server was very nice. I felt a tad rushed and think they need to wait a bit between apps and main course and not ask if I am done while I am eating lol but over all I'm glad we have one here in Phoenix! I also think they need cloth napkins.. The paper ones are kinda lame.

Wow... The food here is delicious! The decor is not the best and the styrofoam plates and cups and plastic forks and seat your self is Linda Twilight Zoney... But once you get passed that this place is a gold mine! The tamales are SO good! The chicken tacos are all white meat and I love the rice.... And I usually don't eat the rice!! We both love it here as so does my mother now that we took her! The only thing that keeps me from a 5 star rating is that I like to be waited on and real plates and glasses and forks made of metal!

First time they scratched my truck... Second chance I sat in line for 5 minutes. No one greeted me so I left.

I really love thus pizza best of all! The meat lovers is my favorite for a regular day. When we are in the mood for some spicy... The southwestern chicken pizza is insane good! The boneless chicken wings are awesome. Me being very picky with chicken I think these are hands down better than buffalo wild wings for sure. If your in the mood for pizza thus is the place to eat!!!

I went in for a standard wash. I've been needing to get a full wax as I have not since 2009.. Not good on my part. Anyhow. They offered to do it right away and not have to schedule as it was not a full detail. My truck was in pretty poor shape looking at it closer after the wash. The top needs to be repainted completely so there was no saving that. The sun here eats up the paint like its candy. The kid that worked on my truck spent so much time looking over his work and making sure he didn't miss anything. My truck looks fantastic. They buffed out all the dull spots on the hood. I was not expecting it to shine up at all. But I left happy. I will defiantly be returning for a full detail when I have the time available.

Amazing food! Chicken & Mozzarella Panini was insane!!! Even when I was stuffed I had to keep eating! Artichoke and hummus app was so good I took leftovers home! Waitress was very nice. Saw I was torn on what bread to pick so she surprised me! I was to go back today and tomorrow just to try everything else! Open a store on the west side! In Litchfield park please!!!!

This place is still excellent!  We ate the Tiki Chicken Masala... So good I almost can't get enough! Every time we go it seems really empty. I hope it picks up! They do need to train the water girl about the menu. She never seems to know what anything is! Lol. But that won't stop us from going. Next we are going to try the buffet.

Great find! First time here. Waitress was extremely friendly. Owner came over to make sure we were enjoying the meal. I had the Spanish omelet. The salsa was very good! Biscuits and gravy were tasty.. Gravy was good with a fresh made heavy biscuit. Over all despite the outside appearance and bric-a-brac decor, we will def be returning!

Great place!  As I was driving by there was a guy giving out free samples. I was not hungry but took one to be nice. As I was driving away I ate my free slice, turned around, went back and bought a pizza. This place is delicious!!! Fantastic toppings. Super friendly and killer pricing. Eat here! You will be hooked!!!  Add roasted figs and goat cheese as topping choices! Please!!!
