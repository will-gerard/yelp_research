Great food and decent prices.  Much better prices than traditional places like Macayo's and Manuel's.    Usually good service but can be challenged when there are a lot of people.  Great bar as well.

Bad experience.  Food was cold.  Filet was tough and not seasoned.   Used to be a good place to eat, but way overpriced for the quality of food.   Next time will go to Ruth Chris or Black Angus.  Anything would be better.  Again, it wasn't about the price, it was about the severe lack of quality.

One of my all time favorite places.   The French Dip is amazing.  You must try it if you are there for lunch or dinner.   Save room for dessert.  Also try the white chocolate martini!!

The new menu at Paradise Bakery is horrible.   The food is tasteless and the staff on the weekend is slow and inexperienced.  I'll be surprise if this location is in business in the next 6 months.   Definitely do not go to this location any longer.

Excellent mexican food at his location and friendly staff.   Good value for your dollar.  Definitely a good place to eat in or take to go.  The fried ice cream is excellent.

5 Stars all the way. If you are looking for a new place for breakfast and want to try something different, the breakfast club is the place to go.  Great service, great location, great menu and great atmosphere.  Also has a great patio to eat outside.

Not as good today.  Service was not great and eggs and meat were overcooked.   Quality is slipping

Long wait, Runs out of food. Poor management.  Waited in line 10 minutes.  Waited another 25 minutes for a togo order before they came out and said they were out of the item.  Didn't offer to expedite the order or anything.  Would have had to wait another 25 minutes.... Really?   Horrible staff and management.

Tried out this new place today.   Looks good from the outside and the interior/atmosphere was decent.  Service was not all that great and the food was ok.  Not bad but nothing to write home about.   Overall a 2.5/3 on the scale.

Great menu and food.  Nice atmosphere once seated.  The only complaint I have with this place is the long lines and no where to sit while waiting in the hot sun  Awesome food and definitely will be back.  Just earlier before the long line starts up..

The Good Egg chain of restaurants is notably a great place for a friendly and tasty breakfast.  Unfortunately this location continues to have challenges with quality, customer service and overall experience.  I have been to this location at least 5 times in the last 2 months and each time there is something wrong with the experience.   From bad service, to burned potatoes, to burned omelettes, to missing items in the togo order, this location could use a refresher on the corporate mission.    I would rate this very poor as feedback has been given and still not good.   Time for new management and employees at this location.
