Chicken salad sandwich with provolone on a toasted french bun, mmmm!!!!!!  This is one of those typical downtown lunch time sandwich places, where you order and seat yourself or get take away.  Quality sandwiches that you really can't go wrong with, not much to rate on service since they don't serve you.  I will mention that they are quick on the sandwich side and create your own salad.  Next time I'll have to try their homemade banana walnut bread.

Have to thank my breos for taking me here with which I would probably have not found this place.  So i was given the disclaimer about this homemade salsa because there is an addiction withdrawal factor.  Holy smackanolies, this salsa was mmmmmmmmmm!!!!!!!!!!!!!   We killed 2 bottles of this heavenly salsa.  Had the #1 lunch combo which was a taco, tostada and tamale.  All really good, authentic, and grubbin.  The tamale had a hint of sweetness, which went perfect with my horchata, mmmmmmm!!!!!.  One of the best horchata I've had also, not to chalky not to sweet.   Service was great although we did get the vip tavo service, free guac and refills.  Lunch time crowd can get quite busy.  I believe this mexican spot was est in the 70s, but its definitely been a local favorite for a long time.  If only they bottled that salsa!

The remodel is disappointing, still smelled like smoke.  Workout room still seems the same, 8 cardio machines, weights up to 50 pound dumbells, a leg machines, a lat pulldown machine, a chest press machine, a dry sauna and a pool.
