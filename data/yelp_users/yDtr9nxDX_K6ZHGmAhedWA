This place is AWESOME.  Best egg salad sandwich I have ever eaten.

Went today to pick up a to-go order and was very disappointed.    We ordered two salads and a sandwich with slaw.  While they mastered putting the tuna salad on the side of one salad, the dressing we ordered was missing.  Neither salad came with a side of bread.     The sandwich was very large and good, however the slaw tasted a little "funky"  almost rancid.     Also, to-go salads should come with forks...... just saying...

Scheduled a service appointment online, which was confirmed.  I arrived 20 minutes early and stood outside for a few minutes next to my car.  After five minutes a man screamed from 50 feet away that I could just wait in an office.  Which I did.... for 15 minutes...with nobody to help me.  Total waste of my time.. Eventually I just left.
