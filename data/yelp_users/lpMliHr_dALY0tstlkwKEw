I've brought my kids to Picture People for many years and they have always done excellent work for the last 5 years... Beautiful, crisp prints with true to life skin tones and great lighting... The last 2 sessions for our family portraits have been low resolution prints... Blurry, skin tone isn't good, brought them back with samples of our many previous year prints to show them a comparison... I'm not sure they can do much... I am hoping the actual image/file is good so I can take them to be printed elsewhere if they aren't able to provide a good print... Like I said, I love Picture People and I've come here for many years and have always been satisfied, but these aren't acceptable prints... Just wanted to share...

We got to the restaurant at 1130am and were greeted and seated at the tepenyaki table for lunch. Mind you, this was our holiday lunch with my admins and we have been to this location previous times and have always had an excellent experience.   First thing, our table chef lacked enthusiasm... We joked, asking if we woke him and he laughed, but still no energy... We hoped for a show, but were told they don't do shows at that location. He obliged our request with a small show, but it seemed like he broke some rules or something.   Secondly, the chicken was tough, not moist or soft, very chewy and hard... Told our waitress about it and she spoke to a gentleman, we assumed was the manager, but he didn't come over to ask us about the food... as the final bill was delivered to us, the manager came over... We did notice that he seemed to avoid us until the bill was due... He discounted is 15% off our bill which was nice.   Experience was not good, food was sub par and the Vegas Roll tasted fishy... We will most likely not go back to this location... It used to be a great location and convenient as it was only a few mins from the office... Hope this might help them to work out some things with their location.

Friend referred us to this restaurant and it has the most amazing sushi I've tasted in the Phoenix Metro Area! Highly recommend the Salmon Mango roll, the cream sauce on this was light and full of flavor paired with the Pleasant Bomber - warm sake and Japanese beer... Excellent combination! Not to mention, excellent service from the staff... We will definitely be back!!

First time here, but the service was great.  DELISH Salud Board (Calabrese Sopersatta, Breasola, Argentina Cacciatore Salami, Blueberry Goat Cheese, Gorgonzola Dolce, Boschettodi Tartufo, Spanish Artichokes, Mostardadi Fruta, Golden & Red Pappadew Peppers, Grissini, Lavash)  Boarded a delightful flight with a Lager, Saison and IPA that put my tastebuds in a frenzy! Atmosphere was inviting and the dart board was a PLUS!  Ready to go back again soon!
