I love the symphony! I may listen to 101.1 etc, but there is nothing like listening and watching musicians with their instruments come together making a beautiful thing! There is a nice calendar of events coming up. If you feel a need to add some culture to your life, this is a fantastic way to do so! Symphony Hall offers comfortable and clean seats. The  ushers are friendly offering help finding your seating, beverage/snacks and other services that might be needed. Restrooms seem to be clean and somewhat well maintained. The acoustics are good allowing the sound to be clear and audible.  I will return, hopefully soon, to hear yet another great concert.

Awesome fun, even for adults without children. We watched a movie about black holes, played with all kinds of informative interactive games and enjoyed watching the enjoyment of children discovering and learning new things.

DELISH.........I look forward to my return.  Wow, the food here was better than I expected. I ordered the rice with shrimp and chicken. It was fantastic. It came with a pur√©ed bean sauce and cheese to put on top. It was made fresh as it was ordered.  All the items we ordered were above and beyond! It was clean inside and very quaint. It looks as though it is a husband and wife owned/run place. Very accommodating and pleasant.  The food was so tasty and non greasy. El Salvador style food is new to me and I like it! I am not a fan of traditional Mexican food....this is a great alternative for Latin flavors. I will return for sure!

It's been a while since i have been here. My last visit here was much more pleasant than tonight.  After being seated, my boyfriend pointed out how filthy the floor was under most of the tables around us.  It was unacceptable, almost to the point of making me sick!  When I used the restroom, the theme carried on.  I know Easter Sunday is a busy day.......however......sweeping under tables between patrons shouldn't be difficult. Chances are I will not return here, well, maybe to sit outside on one of those comfy rockers! LOL The one positive is...........my cornflake baked chicken was pretty tasty and the biscuits with apple butter were Delish! I may be tempted to return just to eat up some of that wonderful apple butter delight.

MIXED FEELINGS......... Do I give this 3 stars or 4. Hmmmmm.  Today is probably not the greatest day for a review from me about this university.  First, I will say that my experience up until this afternoon has been fab. (I will explain in a bit). I've been working closely with my general student dentist and he has been above and beyond making me feel comfortable. He has been very thorough and gentle. We went over my dental plan which will be many months. Maybe I got lucky with Dr W This afternoon, however, was very frustrating. I went to oral surgery to have a molar extracted. I was given several shots with no luck of proper numbing. I've never ever had this happen. The overseeing dentist Dr P had the personality of a wet rag! He came in and said that there's nothing they can do for me. He then asked "any questions?" Literally....before I could speak he said "ok" and turned his back and walked out.  REALLY? Wow! Rude rude rude.  I will hopefully resolve the issue with my general doc. I'm sure he'll help me work something out.  Remember, it is a learning university.

Drs Long are awesome. They, husband and wife team, offer a very friendly environment with up to date technology and techniques. I'm always leaving with a smile and looking forward to my next visit. They take the time to explain what is going on with my health in terms I can relate to. I recommend them highly

Love this place. Somewhat overpriced on many items, but I enjoy walking the isles and looking at what is on the shelves. The bakery is alright. Not the best I've had, though I do like the coconut macaroons. The coffee drinks are delish too, I think much better than Starbucks. I also like the seafood department. Always offering fresh nice options. All in all, it's a fun store to explore.

;Well if it's pork you like.......it's pork you shall have in many many ways!!! All the pork products are made here.  They have so many varieties of sausage, bologna, salami, ribs, roasts, etc etc.  This place has it all.  They even have dog food.  My mom's dog now has a favorite human......me! smoked sausage for dogs, what a great bribing tool. LOL This place has a great small town feel.  Reminds me of the butcher shops from my childhood. I highly recommend this place for their products. If you're looking to BBQ for the summer and upcoming holidays, this place will definitely set you up.

I have been in this shop several times and always with such great service. Today I bought a new bike and again the service was awesome. Very knowledgeable and honest.  Salesman didn't try to upsell me. When I came to pick up the bike, the young men that helped me was absolutely friendly and great to deal with. He took the time to watch me ride, got my seat set, put new pedals on and got me set up with a great front and rear light set. I highly recommend this shop!

I've been here many times. I love the salsa here and could probably make a meal of it.  The service has always been friendly, prompt and always accommodating. The food is average and comparable to other Mexican restaurants of its style. I'm probably not the best judge of Mexican food unless it's seafood style. I'm a lover of a good ceviche which I have yet to find in the Phoenix area...... Back to Manuel's, the restaurant always seems to be clean and tidy. The margarita special on Monday night seems to be a hit. When I come here with my mom and her boyfriend, they both order one, she drinks hers, her boyfriend drinks about a quarter of his and hands it off to her. Down the hatch! Lol. She really loves them here.  I will be back, as it is a nice consistent place to eat  They are willing to make things not on the menu and change around things that are. Nice :-)

I really enjoyed a slushy treat that was offered in a sugar free version.  I felt less guilty ordering it. Haha.  They offer endless mixtures of flavors. I'm sure I will be back especially with the heat coming upon us soon. A nice way to cool off! I shall return......

Great salon providing many services to accommodate most beauty and barber needs. I highly recommend one of the co-owners, Jeanne,  for hair needs. Jeanne is very talented with hair styling and an expert colorist. I also provide most nail services (Melissa) with 30+ years experience. Over all, this salon is a pleasant establishment. Technicians have many years of experience.

Love these stores. I always find myself wondering aimlessly down each isle looking to see what I really don't need to purchase. Somehow the enticement of packaging and advertising finds me pulling out my credit card for something that, at the time, appears to be an item in need.

This is my first time here. My boyfriend has been here before and decided to bring me. I had the egg white omelette with spinach and veggies, wedge potatoes and fresh fruit. I really liked that the omelette had some size to it. (I have found that sometimes restaurants skimp on the egg whites) I was able to replace the Swiss cheese  with cottage cheese  with no additional charge. The potatoes were nicely browned and were not greasy and the fruit was sweet and tasty. My boyfriend ordered a pancake and said it was the best he's had in quite a while. (Too bad they don't have a gluten free one) I liked the atmosphere. They have a nice patio, which will be nice when it cools off. It is very clean and spacious. The wait staff was friendly and accommodating. I'm sure I will return.

This restaurant has been open for many years. Unfortunately, it looks like it. They need a serious clean up.  The restroom was a mess. Maybe I hit it on a bad day. An example.....I used the restroom, an employee was in there as well. There was water all over the counter and paper towels covering the floor and the trash was was piled high. She washed her hands, put on lipstick and walked out. She clearly showed no concern. Really? Wow!  The gal that waited on our table was not very friendly, seemed uninterested, especially when we didn't order alcohol and never once asked how our food was nor thanked us for coming in. My boyfriend hardly ate anything of what he ordered and she pulled the plate never asking how it was or if there was a problem.The food he ordered was unimpressive, cold (should have been warm) and not very good. I ordered the hummus, two flavors, and it was good. Not great especially for homemade, but not bad. We would have said something to the manager, but it seemed hardly worth it. A Yelp review will hopefully catch some attention. It's a really cool setting and I love the patio option upstairs.  Great view.  Too bad it was a bad experience. I was here several years ago and it was much better.

Love Traders. There is always something new here for me to investigate and try. Two of my fav's here are the bag of sliced apples and riced cauliflower. Simple, perhaps, but this place makes my life easy. Lol!  I love the wine selection. It's fun to try different bottles and I'm usually steered in a good direction.  All in all, it's a great shopping experience at Trader Joes. Oh, and the chocolate covered blueberries are Delish!!!

I use this location because they have a good price on gas and it's close to my friends home. It has a filthy parking lot that seems as though it's never been power washed and there is always goo all over the trash receptacles. It's a very tight lot for parking and getting in and out of it takes skill. One must be very careful pulling out. Also, an FYI, be aware of the gentleman in the wheel chair who sometimes blocks the entry from the Southern Ave side. He's harmless but I worry that he may get hit one of these days.  The inside of the store needs serious cleaning and organization. I realize it's a small store and in a busy area, but more attentiveness to cleanliness would be a positive. The employees, so far, have been friendly.

It's Costco! What more can be said? I always seem to take much more time wondering the isles than originally allowing for. Ha! I like all the newer gluten free options being offered. I appreciate the samples. I wish more places offered that. It's a great marketing tool. I have purchased many things I might not have purchased due to the samples behind offered. I'm always back for more!

Who doesn't like Ace?!?! It's sometimes a little more expensive than the other stores, but the customer service is well worth it at times. You know, when you're looking for that strange sized nail or funky tool that you wonder aimlessly at those large stores looking for the familiar apron to ask without any luck ......Ace always seems have someone to help and know exactly where it is and many times only having to buy a couple rather than the whole bag.  I usually can find a coupon to use here and often, when standing in line to pay, find some fun little needless chochsky that I can't live without. Lol

I like shopping here. This store is always clean, organized and well stocked with what I shop for. The bakery is much better than its competitor down the road. I always get compliments when I bring a little somethin naughty but tasty to work...... The customer service is always above and beyond. Just yesterday I bought two Az iced teas thinking they were both on sale. One rang up not on sale, which it wasn't (my mistake), but she gave me the difference anyway. Sweet! I will be back to shop here. I also like their phone app much better than the one down the road. Very user friendly and always full of good coupons and specials.

This is the first time I've been to this restaurant chain. I was very pleased to see a Gluten Free menu, yay! Also, they have great happy hour prices and some relatively healthy options. I liked the atmosphere in the bar area, which is where we dined. I always like a large long bar with plenty of seating as well as table options.  The food I ordered was tasty and service was efficient, fast and pleasant.  The area I was in seemed clean and organized and the restroom followed suit.  I would like to come back here with my happy hour peeps to give it another try.

I always enjoy this restaurant! I usually eat lunch here, and to my surprise, I was pleased to find exactly what I wanted to order on the Gluten Free menu.  I got the Egg White veggie omelette with a side of fruit and a gluten free roll toasted with veggie lite cream cheese. DELISH!  I enjoy the gluten free rolls here. The gluten free bagels are good too, but I think they might use too much xanthan gum which leaves me feeling bloated.   They have a separate display area offering gluten free baked goods to go. I bought the four pack of gf black and white cookies (for my mom, of course. That's my story and I'm sticking to it! LOL)  By the way, they were pretty darn good!  My only negative is that the restaurant could use a fresh coat of paint and a little sprucing up. I will be back for sure :)

Love coming to this theater. It's a great bargain at only $3 per movie and Tuesday is $2! The seating provided is comfortable and clean. The theater rooms always seem clean and well taken care of. There is staff cleaning after every viewing. The restrooms are clean and in order.  We like coming here especially on one of those nights when you just wanna veg out without being broke to do it. Lol I will be back, as usual. Remember, it is a '$' theater, so they don't show the latest releases. However, they keep current with the latest dvd releases.

I love patio dining.  This place provides a very large patio dining and would be good for small parties. The food was good and next time I will try the oysters. The banana pudding in the mason jar (lid provided for taking leftover) was very tasty and not overly sweet. It tasted like homemade pudding. Yum

If you're super hungry for fast foods, this is the place. I was disappointed due to the lack of entertainment. The festival has defiantly changed over the last few years. Mostly food and clothing/nick nack vendors. I made a once around and left. Not worth the drive and parking.

Came here today for the Easter Brunch. I ordered off the menu and my boyfriend got the brunch. Neither of us were impressed by the food.  Very processed and salty.  Nothing seemed to stand out.  As a matter of fact, the food was nauseating and I actually had to excuse myself to the restroom 15 minutes after eating only to find myself hovering over the porcelain basin  (sorry for the description) This is my second unsuccessful visit here.  I will not return.

It's a love-hate relationship! I love doing this hill for an interval training workout. My friends and I do you at least six times: up the paved road-down the other small side-back up then down to the start, near the flour mill.  The last time up we hike the trail to the very top. Great views of downtown Tempe from up there. It's a great workout especially when trying to jog up. It's got a nice steep grade providing a good fat burner. Great trainer especially when needing a break in the weekly workout routine.  Also great for watching the airplanes coming and going from Sky Harbor.

I 'upgraded' from the $3 to the $6 wash. It actually was better than the $3. The one thing that bugs me about this place is 9 out of 10 times I come here, the dryer doesn't seem to work. I'm always wiping my car down. I come prepared with towels! I do like the free vacuum and large car cleaning bays.

We came in a group of seven at 2:00am during a break during Ragnar Del Sol. We sat there for 20min before the order was put in. Sadly, we waited because nothing else was open. The server didn't even take our order until we had to hunt him down. Terrible service. I would think a large chain like this would be better equipped with good servers. I will not return here.

This is my first time here. I'm always in search of good gluten free pizza. I have not found one until tonight. Not only was it very tasty, but reasonably priced as well. I loved the fact that the crust was thin and crispy. My boyfriend could not tell that it was gluten free, which he is quite the food critic. I will defiantly return here.

Yummers! I like the coffee here. I like it more than the large box franchise competitor.  I think the coffee tastes smoother and not as bitter. I like the idea of a small kiosk seeming store with an option of drive up service.  I wish there were more locations, but then again, if that were so, prices may go up to cover costs of expending. Ugggh  Perhaps keeping it small with less locations will keep the cost and quality the way it is.  I will be back to try the chocolate coconut coffee drink. I hear it is Delish!!!

I absolutely loved the coffee here. Very robust but smoooooth! I enjoyed the buckwheat crepe with veggies. Unfortunately, not gluten free, which I will pay for. Ugggh, though worth the itching and tummy ache. Lol They have a lovely menu and are in the process of expanding the dining area.  We got here early due to a long waiting line.  There is limited patio seating so plan accordingly.

Love this store. I heard about them thru my triathlon club I belong to. They are one of the sponsors.  They offer expert help with all your running and walking needs. They've put me into several great pairs of shoes. I especially love the trail runners they put me into. They also did a full price trade-in with a pair of running shoes that didn't work for me with no questions or any hassles.  They host many running events and organize weekly running group workouts.  If you're looking for running or walking shoes, I highly recommend them. Much more helpful than the larger 'box' store.

I love breakfast here. I get the sunrise wrap with a substitute of grilled veggies instead of rice and the tortilla wrap on the side. Gluten free wrap, that is. Yes, it is probably the best gluten free tortilla I've had. I like wrap part of it on the side so I can take it home.  Tasty. I also love the ice tea here. They have a nice patio and the inside is eclectic with a trendy vibe.  I'm sure I will visit again soon. It's a great pit stop during a nice long bike ride.

Blood test.........how exciting can this be???  My history,.......yes.....I'm a fainter! I have been down on the ground, passed out many times from getting my blood drawn. Lol I made my appointment online for 10:00am, and they called my name at 10:00am! Wow! On time? Is it possible? Maybe I got lucky.  When going back behind the closed doors, I told them I'm 'one of those'. The technician told me they had a bed for me to lay on to make me comfortable.  I went back to the room with the bed, made myself comfortable, and before I knew it, she had the needle in (I hardly felt it), and Bam! Done! She was awesome!  This is not on my list of fun things to do. Being said, my experience here was alright. I will return to this location again.

How bad can the great outdoors be??? I love hiking here. Parking is a bit crazy on weekends so if you plan to park here, come early. (I park in a nearby neighborhood to avoid the jam.) There are miles of great trails from challenging to easy does it! There a trail map near restrooms.  The restroom is usually pretty clean and maintained. They also have nice covered  picnic benches and tables for resting, dining or just hanging out.  It is dog friendly park however leash laws are in order here.  A word to those who plan to hike here, there is NO trash pick up on trails so please, please take your trash including dog poop bags out with you to trash cans at parking lot. I get so upset (I'm keeping my language clean lol) when I see bags and trash along the trails!!! Enjoy the trails my friends! What a great way to stay healthy!

This is one store that frustrates me! Often, whatever I'm in search of, I can't seem to find. I go from one side of the store to the other with little luck of finding the isle it might be in as well as finding an employee to assist me.Very Frustrating!!! This store, in my opinion, is a bit messy, disorganized, junky and full of too many useless nic-nacs. I find it distracting when I'm in search of something. Patience is a requirement to shop here.   I will say, prices are comparable to other competitors and they carry similar products. They also honor coupons from Joanns.  .

Not my kind of place. I'm not particularly one to wait to order food, wait in a line to receive it and basically wait on myself. Disappointingly,  food wasn't all the great. Nothing to write home about. I'm not really sure as to why the place is so popular. I am not anxious to return.

This location was previously 24 hr fitness.  It is an old club and could use a little sprucing up. I do like that they have half weights (12.5lb, 17.5lb, 22.5lb, etc) Many La Fitness locations do not offer that. It is a small club with a small cardio area as well as a small free weight room, which is where I spend most my time. I would not come here again at busy time, 4-7pm. A little crowded and I had to wait to use a flat bench.  I will try this club again at an earlier time and see how it is. I will more than likely use this location again if I'm near the area.
