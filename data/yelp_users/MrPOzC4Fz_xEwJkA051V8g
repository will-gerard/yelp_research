Oh Wild Thaiger, how I do love thee! Actually, to be more specific, how I do love pad thai.   I hadn't been to Wild Thaiger in a while because I hate navigating around Central Avenue these days, but it was my co-worker's birthday and she wanted Wild Thaiger. I'm so so glad we went there, and I was double happy this afternoon when I ate my leftovers for lunch. The best thing about the pad thai at Wild Thaiger (besides that it is so good) is that there is so much I always have lunch the next day ( which is just lovely).   A note for those south of McDowell trying to get to Wild Thaiger: Drive up 3rd Street and turn left on Roanoke. You'll dead end into a strip mall parking lot. Park there and walk a few steps south to Wild Thaiger. Viola!   I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 because I ordered a Coke and it tasted funny ... like way too soda-watery. When I told the waitress, she sort of shrugged and said, "A lot of people say that." Yeah .... I had to ask, "So, can I get something different please?"  But my pathetic Coca Cola aside, it was a great lunch, and she even brought my co-worker toasted coconut ice cream in a coconut dish with a candle. How sweet!

I eat at Fate frequently. It's my go-to place when I'm downtown and want something yummy that I know I'm going to love. The only two dishes I ever order are the Chow Fun or the Hong Kong Flat Rice, and I only ever order tofu.   I once got chicken and was displeased with the size and texture of the chicken, so now I stick to tofu. I think Fate has the best fried tofu I have ever had.   If you don't want to wait, be sure to make a reservation and it's generally speaking a more enjoyable atmosphere for smaller parties (ie, one or two people with you) rather than a large group. With such an intimate kitchen, it's impossible for everyone at your table to get your food at the same time. But, when you get your food, it's right out of the wok, steps from your table.

I really want to like Zoe's Kitchen. I do. I really, really do.   I have been to Zoe's more than 5 but less than 10 times, and yesterday was my last visit, unless I want to stop in for some limeade and chocolate cake.   I have tried MANY things at Zoes, and I try to listen to what others like .... I don't like their bread at all, so every sandwich I've had has been bad. The quesadilla is OK, but I'm not a big fan of flour tortillas. The chicken roll ups (I think that's what it's called) that I had yesterday (after a good friend's recommendation) were kind of soggy and yuck-o. I don't like the pasta salad .... or the potato salad ... or their slaw .... or cold rice ....   Do you see my challenge here? The decor is adorable, and I really want to love the place, but I think I've paid my very last visit to Zoes.   So, so sad!

I met a group of "Spa Girlfriends" here for dinner before we had a big meeting at the Doubletree. We needed something fast, yummy and close to 44th and Van Buren.  Bingo!  I preface this review by stating that since i was in a group of 7, I didn't necessarily order the items that I would order (does that make sense?).  We had one great specialty dish (had the word Phoenix in it) with chicken and large shrimp and veggies in a spicy brown sauce - delicious! Other entrees included house special chow mein, beef & broccoli and sweet & sour pork. Again, not items that I would have picked, but for the group, it worked.  The main reason I give Lao Ching Hing 4 stars is it totally passed my "sauce test." I am big on sauces. Specifically, the consistency of the sauce (and, of course, taste). I hate runny sauces ... I hate when there is not enough sauce .... And it's harder than you might imagine to get it right.   All of the sauces were great. Perfect consistency and very flavorful. I'm not a huge fan of sweet & sour anything, mostly because I survived college working at a fabulous restaurant in Tucson called The Mandarin Grill and quickly learned the difference between real Chinese cuisine and Americanized Chinese cuisine. Sweet & Sour is the quintessential Americanized Chinese dish.   The chow mein was fair - not spectacular, but not greasy (the way it often is at restaurants).  The service was great. I never got close to emptying my water glass, and our group had a nice big table in the back where we could be as chatty and spunky as we wanted. The food arrived quickly, and everyone managed to clean her plates.   I will return!!

For me, Scott's Generations is the epitome of comfort food. Last week I felt really crummy, and the only think that made me feel better was a piping hot cup of matzoh ball soup and a crispy potato latke with applesauce.   When I'm feeling right as rain, I indulge with their New Yorker sandwich: corned beef, pastrami and coleslaw on yummy rye bread .... It's amazing.   Scott's even impressed my New York born-and-raised mother (while Chompie's does not).

Shame on me for going to a chain Mexican restaurant in Arizona.   I must hang my head and sigh.   My defense? I was in the Ahwatukee area, I was SO SO hungry, and my friend really wanted a margarita. Then, she ended up not even ordering a margarita! Oh well.  I ordered the cheese and onion enchiladas (I was craving a grilled cheese sandwich, so cheese enchiladas sort of fit the bill). They were not very good. It tasted as if they pulled a corn tortilla from a package, put the cheese and onions inside, poured room temperature sauce on top, and put it in the microwave for a minute.   I hate paying for food at a restaurant when I could have made it better at home.  Don't go here.   Really.

I ordered the crispy tofu which comes with an assortment of veggies and is drenched in a brown garlic sauce, but I also added a little spice. It was good, and I'll definitely come back for it again. The service was friendly and speedy -- a nice little lunch find.

Get the mussels.   Really, be sure you get the mussels. Oh, and I dare you not to pick up the bowl and drink the white wine/butter/garlic broth. Amazing.  I recently had a great business dinner here. Everyone was happy. I enjoyed their flat iron steak, which was recommended by our waiter. My guests had the filet mignon and the scallops.   All of this, plus some great wine ... it was a good night out!  If the weather is nice, sit on the back patio. It's gorgeous and will make that Bistro name come to life!

Last night I went to The Melting Pot with three girlfriends for a special "Girls' Night Out" event that they marketed. There was a set menu, and the price was $29 per person with a few options for $5 martinis. If you wanted a drink that wasn't on the set menu, you paid extra.   When we arrived, we were greeted outside by two very bronzed girls who were promoting Planet Beach tanning salon. They gave us as many samples as we could carry (for those of us who wanted tanning lotions and such) and had a entry form for a free month of tanning.  We had reservations for 6:15, so we were seated promptly. Our waiter, Cody, came over to introduce himself and explain how things were working that evening. When we asked about the other activities outside (we had seen girls getting paraffin dips and hand massages and eyebrow waxing in the courtyard), Cody told us that we could participate after dinner. Angela, our friend who made the reservation said when she called they told her we could get those services until 10 PM. So, we relaxed.  We ordered our cheese and cooking options and then some drinks. The drinks took forever to arrive. Seriously. We had almost completely finished our cheese fondue by the time the drinks arrived.   The cheese option we selected was a spinach and artichoke white cheese concoction that was delicious. But isn't anything with cheese delicious? :-)  There were several times when we complained (to ourselves) about our lack of drinks. Later, when one of our friends said she would want to order another martini in about 5 minutes, our waiter said, "I should probably go put it in now, though, considering how backed up they are." We thought, 'Oh wow, they are really busy with this promotion.' Turns out they had no glasses. In fact, the Ahwatukee location had to run over glasses for Scottsdale. I thought it very odd that the restaurant would advertise a big Girls' Night Out event and not be prepared for ladies wanting drinks. Oh well.   We choose the basic bouillion cooking style, and our plates contained sirloin, filet, chicken, shrimp, butternut squash ravioli, and an assortment of veggies. It was a ton of food! We were not expecting to get so much at the discounted price.   Our chocolate fondue choices were limited to milk, dark or white. Three of us were up for dark and one wanted white, so Cody was nice enough to bring her a little bowl of white chocolate. We had a ton of dessert .... And it was delicious.  Meanwhile, a woman from Mary Kay came over carrying a basket of what looked like presents. She asked us if we had heard about the drawing yet, and we said no. She said, "OK, well, I'll just leave these entry forms here with you." And, she did. But, she never told us what the drawing was for .... and she never returned. She asked us "Does anyone have any Mary Kay products in their purse." One of my friends did, and she got "a prize" - one of the presents. Then she asked us, "Does anyone have any lipstick at all." We all did. We all got "presents." Our present was a bag of marketing materials, which was kind of a let down.   Next, the bill. This got a little weird because there were additional charges on our bill that didn't make sense to us. We paid with three credit cards, and all I know is I was charged $6 more than I should have been, and my friends who had either higher priced drinks or multiple drinks paid less. We asked the waiter about some of the charges, and apparently one of the drinks ordered was not on the set menu and was therefore extra. Though, we had asked about making an adjustment and he never said it would be more.   We excitedly went to the courtyard for our treatments and discovered that everyone was either gone or was cleaning up! And it was still early! That was a bummer ....  So, overall, the food was great, and it was so nice to connect with friends over a leisurely dinner. The price was perfect - about $40 a person when you consider drinks and tip - and if they do another such event, I will go again, but try to arrive early to make the most of the activities.

Free popcorn.  I'm a sucker for popcorn. I could have just eaten a huge, decadent meal, and I can always nibble on some popcorn. It's my favorite snack.  So, what does this have to do with Palm Valley Cinemas? Well, essentially, one of the only good things about this place is that you get a free large popcorn just by showing your adult ticket at the concession stand. You have to know this somehow because there is no signage indicating this deal. How did I hear? A friend of my husband who practically lives at this movie theater.  The other OK thing about Palm Valley Cinemas is that if you live in Goodyear, it's the closest movie theater. But, I would happily drive to the Harkins at the 101 and I-10 or even the AMC at Westgate to never smell the funky oddness that permeated the hallway entering our screen room.   The chairs are not uncomfortable, but everything is, well, quite old and tired-looking.   I would never choose Palm Valley Cinemas for a long-awaited film, but to catch a quick flick on the fly, it's not completely horrible.  And, free popcorn!

Earlier this week, I adopted a 5 week old kitten whose mother died tragically (if you are reading this during May of 2008 and want a kitten, let me know because there are 3 others).   I had no idea what to do with such a little kitten. He was not weaned from his mother and now needed me to be his mama cat. I don't know how to be a mama cat!  So, I brought him to my family's vet - Goodyear Animal Hospital on Estrella and Van Buren. we have been going here for 3 or 4 years now, and every time we go I think, 'This is how our PEOPLE doctors need to treat US.'  I have almost always had pets, and I have dealt with many veternarians who make me feel guilty ..... Kittty obesity ..... Declawing .....Let's run every test in the book and spend 1000s of dollars in case it's XXXXX ......  I always feel good about myself and my pets' care at Goodyear Animal Hospital.  The receptionists and technicians are friendly and helpful, and while there is a staff of 5 vets on site, I highly recommend Amy Schomburg and Laural Casler (both DVM).  Dr. Casler answered all of my questions about my new little buddle of furry joy, and sent me off with a nursing kit and a dewormed kitty.   I had a few concerns the next day .... Mostly about poop. Sorry folks, but did you know with a very little kitten you have to simulate the feel of the mother licking the kitten's ... parts? So warm, wet cotton pad to the rescue! I had to call the staff at Goodyear Animal Hospital twice, and they always answered my questions while giving me guidance for bringing him back in.   Another perk .... They are open 7 days a week! So, I wasn't having Friday afternoon pangs of panic. Worst case scenario, I could get in to see th doctor on Saturday morning.  Kitten is fine, by the way. We named him Huxley.

This morning my co-workers and I met for an impromptu "breakfast" at Willo Baking Company. It was such a gorgeous morning, so we sat outside on the slightly reclining patio chairs that make you feel like you should be on the beach (only you're on McDowell Rd.).   I enjoyed a truly fabulous cup of coffee, and the three of us each had a different type of pastry or muffin.  I'm not much of a "dessert at breakfasttime" kind of person, but I really wanted to indulge, so I had a raspberry danish. The danish had actual fresh raspberries in the center, and it was perfect!   (Speaking of my issue with dessert first thing in the AM, I should mention that I brought my own hard boiled egg with me so I could have something healthy before devouring a ton of sugar. The man working at Willo even tapped on the glass and held up a packet of salt with a smile. It was funny.)   It was so peaceful sitting there, and I found it quite funny that we could tilt our necks and see the mob gathering outside Starbucks just across the intersection.  I do enjoy some Starbucks from time to time, but this particular morning, I was awfully glad to be away from the hub-bub of a busy morning.

All chicken dinners should start out with a side of waffle, don't you think?  A group of us went to Lo Lo's on Saturday night before the opening of Arizona Theatre Company's AIN'T MISBEHAVIN'. We figured dining on soul food would be a great precursor to the amazing music of "Fats" Waller.   The service was super-quick (although, it WAS quite early. We were there at 5:30 PM). Our friends who are regulars recommended spouses sharing the Soul Food Platter. I thought that was a good idea, but my husband said, "Next time, I'm getting my own!"   We started off with a waffle - yum - and then got our fried chicken (which I never, ever have, so that was a real treat), grits, cornbread, and mac & cheese.   OK, this is bad ... I'm getting hungry thinking about our food from last night. I think that's a sign that we will need to return sometime soon.   A note about credit cards: They informed us that they would not accept more than 2 transactions per party, which was good to know. Luckily, most people had cash, so we only had to have them run one card. Just be aware, as people are so used to handing over multiple credit/debit cards these days.

Finding a really good, homey Chinese restaurant is really important to me and my husband. Call us crazy, but we love Chinese food, and there's something special about a family-style restaurant that can't be replaced with all the PF Changs and Pei Weis and Panda Expresses of the world.   When a friend told me her family has been going to Wong's for years and years, I knew I had to try it.   When we walked in, the decor reminded me of my family's local Chinese restaurant that we loved. After we were seated, our waitress brought us hot tea and ice water. My husband and I have a ritual: he gets whatever is most like his favorite dish (General Chu's Chicken) and I get something different. Then, he has to have noodles.   He found the Emperor's Chicken, which was very good. The big chunks of white meat chicken were fried, but not thickly battered. The sauce was spicy with a hint of sweetness. Our other dish was the Mongolian Beef. It was very good, but not as good as my favorite Mongolian sauce - at the Mandarin Grill in Tucson. The lo mein noodles were good, but my husband wanted the BBQ pork, and that's not really something I like.   My water glass was never even half empty before our waitress came to refill it, and the tea was very good.   I am so happy to have found a good Chinese restaurant in the West Valley, not too far from home.

This was a great place to end the night.  Let me provide background: 6 of us girls went out to dinner (at Furio) for a lovely Girls' Night Out. After dinner, we wandered north down Scottsdale Rd looking for a place to sit, chat and get a drink (or two).   When we hit Italian Grotto, one of my friends said, "Oh, this place has the best margaritas." It happens to be a favorite spot of her father's, and we peered in - it looked perfect.  They seated us enthusiastically, and the entire place was oozing "NEW YORK." It was great. Our waiter was friendly, nosy, and flirtatious. Great for a group of married women out for a night. :-)  I wasn't sure what I wanted to drink. I told him I wanted vodka, but not a vodka tonic, but nothing too sweet .... He said, as he walked away, "you're having a Mandarin Press."   Well, OK then.  Our drinks arrived, and I loved mine. Mandarin vodka with Sprite cut with club soda. It was fizzy and yummy and not too sweet.   A couple of the girls ordered an Appletini and the Cadillac Margarita (pretty strong drinks), so when two of us polished off ours earlier, the waiter came back with replacements (another Mandarin Press for me and a Gin & Tonic for another girl) and told us they were "on him."   The music they played was great - jazzy and classic. The bar had rows and rows of Yankee bobble-heads, and the 3 flat screens above the bar featured basketball and baseball.   I think we sort of closed the place down. It was 11:00 when we started to think about leaving, and the place was emptying.   It was exactly what we were looking for - a nice big round booth great for conversation. Perfect ambiance for the low-key end to our evening that we loved.   I would go back in a heartbeat.

I am so glad that I found Dr. David Rusick. Our good friend, Dr. Chad Stewart, recommended him to me. Chad is also a chiropractor, but his clinic is in Laveen, so it's not very convenient for me to go to. Chad's very own wife goes to see Dr. Rusick, so what does that say?   The staff there is very friendly, and everyone takes such good care of me. Whether I am in for a regular adjustment or I am in a lot of pain and need special attention, I always feel a million times better after visiting this clinic.

My friends Heather and Joe and I decided to meet up for dinner on a Wednesday evening, and Heather picked Barrio Cafe. I'd never been there before, and everyone is always telling me how good the food is, so I was quite excited.   Before I even arrived, Heather sent me a text message that I can paraphrase with: The chairs are so uncomfortable, I think I'm going to cry.   I called her and told her we should go somewhere else if she was so uncomfortable (oh, I should mention that Heather is pregnant ... with twins). Just then, Joe walked in and saved the day (dun-dun-da-da!) with a plush towel he happened to have in his car. Ahh ... Heather's tush was now at ease.   When I arrived, Joe and Heather had already decided to get the Queso Fundido: Roasted poblanos, sauteed spinach, mushrooms and melted Oaxacan cheese with queso fresco & chorizo. It was served with chips and bread, and it was delicious.   Joe and I also ordered la Sangria, which is their Sangria made with red wine, mango puree & Jack Daniels. This was also quite yummy - I'd love to try to recreate it at home.  Both Joe and Heather got the Enchiladas de Mole, which the waiter actually hesitated on and warned them that not everyone likes it. Heather and Joe were perplexed ... They like mole ... Apparently some people who like mole don't like the mole at Barrio Cafe ... Flashforward to the end of the meal: Neither Joe or Heather really thought the mole was that great.  I tried something completely different and got the Enchiladas de Hongos, sauteed wild mushroom melange with queso de cabra and aciete de trufa blanca. They pretty much had me at goat cheese (oops, I mean queso de cabra). Complimenting the dish were roasted vegetables that were so sweet .... Mmmm .... the cheese was light and fluffy, and the white corn tortillas were so soft that the enchiladas tasted like a Mexican version of cheese blintzes.   I stopped myself from over-eating (although, it was so good, it took some major effort), and now I have leftovers to enjoy for lunch tomorrow. Yum!

Great happy hour! Be sure to arrive before 6pm to take advantage of their awesome "island time" menu (aka happy hour), even available on Saturday. Our foursome enjoyed cocktails: grapefruit basil martini, mojito and margaritas. Everyone was happy. There are great apps on the HH menu too -- the ahi tuna poke is great, and my husband liked the fish tacos. My gluten free friend had a hard time, however. She settled on a salad, but the GF entree options were disappointing. Everyone enjoyed his or her meal. Great ambiance!

Please make sure you visit Cibo at least once for lunch and once for dinner - the menus are completely different and are equally delicious and enticing.   I love the pizza at Cibo, and I'm not really a pizza-girl. Everything is so fresh and they've got a nice selection of wine.   I work very nearby and finally was able to take my husband there for dinner. At first he was wondering where in the world I was taking him, but he was incredibly happy with the feel of the restaurant and the quality of the food. He told our waitress, "This is the closest to Italian pizza I've had." We had been to Italy about 5 years prior and he was desperately hunting for something remotely reminiscent of the Margarita Pizza we had in Florence.

I work right down the street from Tammie Coe on Roosevelt, and for months my co-workers and I have been talking about getting Tammie Coe cupcakes. Our problem is, we always end up eating lunch way too late and never make it to cupcake time.  Yesterday, we made a point to eat lunch at 11:30 and then skipped right over to Tammie Coe.   The cakes and cupcakes and cute little tarts are absolutely gorgeous. We were overwhelmed by our 4 cupcake choices (we wanted them all), and ultimately both of my co-workers chose the Ooey Gooey and I had the Vanilla Toffee.   We got back to our office and dove in. My Vanilla Toffee cupcake had so much frosting, it was way too much for me. Granted, I'm not a frosting kind of girl, but even my co-worker commented on both the amount of frosting on my cupcake and then texture. Her cake was lighter and smoother, while mine was incredibly dense. If I go back for another cupcake, it will be for the Ooey Gooey (there is a good reason why this one is their most popular, I'm sure).   I indulged in Tammie Coe once prior at a friend's birthday. I still don't know if it was the cake or the assortment of very sweet cocktails, but I remember not being a huge fan of the very very rich, very decadent birthday cake. I like sweets, but Tammie Coe is too sweet for me.

I must preface this by saying that I am not a fan of Tammie Coe cakes or cupcakes ... they are just WAY too sweet for me. However, I had lunch fro Tammie Coe today, and oh my ... fabulous!  I selected the Tammie Coe "Box Lunch." I was able to select any sandwich + chips + a monster-sized cookie the size of my head + a drink. $10.   My sandwich was VERY good, and I'm really not a "sandwich" person. I'd much rather have a bowl of pasta or something hot. If it's cold, I'd prefer it to be sushi. But this was GOOD. I had a roast beef sandwich with creamy horseradish sauce ... and the bread was amazing. Just as much as I am not a sandwich person, I am not a bread person. I could easily give up carbs. This bread was fabulous.   I nibbled on the enormous chocolate chip cookie throughout the afternoon ... It's always easier to do your job when you have a chocolate chip cookie, dotcha think?  I'll definitely be back for lunch soon.

I'm not going back to Tammie Coe for a while ... really.   My co-workers and I have been making a habit of grabbing lunch from Tammie Coe. It's so close to our office, and we've been enjoying the sandwich of the day and an amazing cookie. We were on a once a week basis with Tammie Coe.   I'm done - for now.   We've had back to back BAD experiences at Tammie Coe lately. Horrible service!! What happened?   My favorite conversation from our last visit:  Me (after waiting nearly 20 minutes for my sandwich): Did you put my soup in there?  Clerk: Um .... (looks around and sees soup on counter). No, here it is.  But, do you want me to put it in something else? In a drink carrier?  Me: (puzzled look)  Clerk: If I just put it in the bag, it will spill all over.  Me: Then yes, please put it in a carrier. (Internally: No, I want my hot soup spilled all over after I waited 20 minutes for a cold sandwich. Toss it in the bag, why dontcha?)  The food is still very good. It's just not cheap, and I don't mind paying a bit extra for good food and good service. The staff there is in slow motion or something lately.

I am still thinking about the gnocci I had at Circa 1900 back in July. Any dinner that remains deliciously vivid in my memory for four months has got to be worthy of five stars.  I had a great time with one of my good friends. We were excited to see they used Effen vodka to make their martinis and had a great blackberry cosmo. I was afraid it would be too fruity for me, but it was fabulous.  I had a fresh tomato salad - perfect for the Arizona summer - and a very light gnocci dish with a delicate broth and mushrooms.   We didn't get a chance to have dessert because we were running to a movie - Another great thing about Circa 1900 is its location. We were able to walk to the Arizona Center to catch our movie and then rounded out our evening with some ice-cream at Cold Stone.

Our dinner at Fuego Bistro last night was stellar.   Our mission: to explore Cuban-inspired meals for an upcoming Cuban party. We accepted with glee, and we finished with happy, full bellies.   First things first: drinks. Three of us ordered a different type of mojito: mango, blood orange and pomegranate. I had the mango mojito, and it was very good, but I could really only have one because it was rather sweet. My friend Cara doesn't do rum, so she got her signature margarita ... sort of. Our waitress, Suzie, was fantastic. "Oh, you want the skinny girl margarita - I'll take care of you, don't worry." Her other famous line of the night was, "Don't worry, if you don't like your drink, I'll drink it for you and we'll make you another." When we DID like our drinks, it was "Oh, so I guess I'm staying sober tonight."   The four of us shared the signature empanadas and the jumbo sauteed prawns - both very good.   For dinner, I ordered the Natural Farm Chicken Breast: pounded, panko breaded in a sauce of tomatillo cream, goat cheese, bacon and tortilla pico de gallo. I chose the Green Chili Cornbread Casserole and Sauteed Organic Green Beans for my sides. Half of the meal is sitting in my fridge right now, waiting for me to visit it at lunch time. The portions were so huge!  The rest of the table featured the Cola and Pineapple Soy Braised Angus Short Rib Roast, the Signature Pernil Asado, the Homemade Tortilla Soup and the Fuego Salad. Two thumbs up from every diner. And, I was not the only one who went home with leftovers.   My husband gets some Yelp brownie points for telling our waitress, "My wife here, she's a big time yelper. She'll write a great review of this place tomorrow. " Suzie said, "I'm glad you just mentioned Yelp because now I can take 20% off your bill." And she did.   Fuego Bistro IS tucked away - be sure you have clear directions with you. You can't expect to see if from a main road like 7th Street.   Enjoy!

I haven't been to Kincaid's in a couple of years, but I just returrned from an event catered by Kincaid's, and I think I'll be walking through their door again when the theatre season is up and rolling (this October).   I was a little worried when I realized this was a paper plate, plastic fork, balance your food and marketing materials with nowhere to sit kind of lunch. Kincaid's did a fabulous job.   We had freshly steamed vegetables, mashed potatoes, dijon chicken, and even a fabulous key lime tart for dessert.   The veggies were crisp and yummy, despite being served in a steam tray (though I think I saw the catering manager pouring Fiji water into the pans, so they were being kept warm with high-quality H2O).  The potatoes were creamy and flavorful, and the chicken was SO good, it makes me want to recreate it at home. The breasts were pounded very thin and were covered in a crispy, oniony coating (fried) and drizzled with the dijon sauce.   The individual key lime pies had a good 4-inch diameter and were creamy inside with fluffy meringue on top.   I can't wait to revisit the restaurant this fall! From what I remember, it makes a great date night restaurant, and it's very close to the theatre.  NOTE: My co-worker just informed me that the Fiji bottle was a mere vessel for the lovely tap water from the bathroom sink at the Herberger Theater Center. Oh well! And here I thought I was getting a royal treatment.

I love Leaps. :-)   First, it's locally owned, so when you enjoy a treat at Leap's you are also helping a fellow West Valley resident. Isn't that nice?  On Monday morning I enjoyed a fabulous mocha and a delicious whole wheat bagel - toasted with peanut butter ... yum! I went back later that afternoon to pick up a bagel each for my two children.   If you have kids, bring them to Leap's! My kids made a bee-line to the "Lily Pad" to write on the chalkboard and play with the books and toys there. Now that I know there is free wireless internet, I plan to return with work and enjoy my coffee while my 4 year old twins entertain themselves in the "Lily Pad."  It's on Indian School Road, just east of Dysart.

Just a quick update to my review ... The ownership of Leap's has changed, though it looks like they are keeping the same look and feel of the place.

I had a great time at Grazie in Verrado on Saturday night with a large group: me and my husband, two other couples, four 4-year-olds and one 2-year old. You couldn't miss us.  We opted for the outdoor seating, which was very nice under the misters at 6 PM. We had a nice view of a small park area, and while the six adults and 2-year-old sat at one table, the 4-year-olds got their own table right behind us.   We had a bottle of a great red wine - the Amarone 2003 Corte Giara. I'm a fan of bold, red wines, but my friend who was there who is more of a white wine person also really liked this wine.   My husband and I split the Insalta della Casa - baby greens with tomatoes, cucumbers, olives and red peppers, and we had the creamy gorgonzola dressing. Yum. We also shared a pizza - the Vegetariana. I can't believe I got my pepperoni-only-eating husband to go for this, and it was really great: mozzarella (made in house), provolone, carmelized onions, roasted peppers, and parmigiano reggiano.  The kids split their own pizza: a basic cheese pizza with pepperoni on one side.   The pizza reminded us of Cibo (which also reminds us of pizza in Italy). The crust is thin but slightly chewy.   Next time, I want to go back without the kids for the wine-tasting events that they do. I believe the events are the first Sunday of the month, and you get to try 6 or 7 wines (and a friend told me you get more than just a "taste" - practically a full glass) plus a course to match each wine. It's a great way to familiarize yourself with the food and wine menu, and it's only $40 a person. There are locations in Old Town Scottsdale and DC Ranch, so if Verrado is way out of the way for you, you can try one of the other locations.  But .. the great thing about Grazie in Verrado is two doors down there is a coffee shop that serves gelato. So, after the kids ran around in the fountain (yeah, um, that's what happens when the dads are in charge of the kids while the moms pay), we walked over to get some yummy gelato.

"Ode to Circle K"  (Author's note: I feel obligated to give this business 5 stars given that I am exalting it in an ode.)  You're the kind of place I hate to like With your dingy, shady lurkees Though I seek you out and make the hike For a cold, refreshing slurpee. When someone calls and says your name I leap and grab my purse Then stop, and make my withdrawal tame To avoid overspending, thievery ... or worse!  You always have just what I desire in a chocolate or caffeine crisis But it doesn't help me think you higher That your staff often doesn't know your prices! And there's so many things I've learned about the world (Like the early-afternoon 24-pack) In my youth I swear my toes would have curled At the sight of - "Ooh, look! The candy sale rack!"

Review Update: Circle K is in the process of being remodeled. New flooring, new countertops, walk-in beer fridge ... Once the remodel is complete, I will construct my next poetic masterpiece.

Love, love, love the Pho here. I usually order chicken with broccoli and bok choy. I recently opted for their lunch special and enjoyed the sautéed chicken with cashews. It was good, but I think I will generally stick to the Pho.

Please note: This review is 100% based on esthetician Grace's services.  So, I'm going to keep this short and sweet .... I was a bikini wax virgin .... Now I am not. Grace was awesome. Some people have told me they like a no-nonsense, quiet and fast worker for this service. I was totally freaked out, and Grace had a very maternal quality that I needed.   Sorry folks - you usually get more of a "story" out of me, but I'm just not going to go there this time.

Here's the #1 tip for having a good urgent care experience: Register online.  Go to www.nextcare.com and you can check in right online. You fill out all of the "paperwork," and then within maybe 15 minutes or so, a representative calls from NextCare and helps you pick the appropriate NextCare location AND offers you an appointment.   The first time I went to the NextCare in Avondale, I had an appointment. I walked in, signed my name, told the girl I had checked in via web, handed over my ID and insurance card, and paid my co-pay. A few minutes later, I was in an exam room with a doctor.   This morning I visited the same facility with my sick son. Appointments were not available until 10 AM, but I wanted to get there at 9 AM. We waited maybe 20 minutes (I brought a book, and my son curled up next to me).   What I have noticed both times is that there was no wait once I got an exam room. Often at doctors' offices, you wait in the waiting room and then wait in the exam room. Everything moved very quickly. And, if you need a prescription filled, they do offer some right on site, or there is a pharmacy in the same medical plaza, and they fax it right over. No getting in and out of the car... less waiting ... All in all, a fairly decent experience.

A glimpse into the past week of my life ... In 3 days I visited Nextcare Urgent Care 2 times.   The first time was for my sick son. The second time was for my sick husband.   I won't get into too many details, but my husband had the most horrible headache of his life, complete with wretching and sobbing - overall, a very scary experience for both of us. It was Sunday, so I logged onto the computer and signed in to Nextcare, and off we went!  The doctor was extremely thorough, and I was super impressed with the facility because when she ordered blood tests and an EKG, the techs came right in and did the tests. Even at our family doctor, we have to go elsewhere for these types of tests.   We left with him feeling better, with comprehensive test results (for both the blood tests and the EKG), and referrals for specialists.   This experience far surpassed my expectations for an Urgent Care clinic.

Everything about our experience at My Big Fat Greek Restaurant was clouded by the fact that our waitress was IRRITABLE. She took one look at us and was instantly done. I mean, can you blame her? We were 6 well-dressed 30-somethings having a leisurely dinner and drinks before the theatre. (Can you feel my sarcasm??) Sorry about that, but seriously? We were, like, the perfect table that evening. Big fat check at the end of the meal should have equaled big fat tip for her.   Let's talk about what WAS good: My martini. I got a dirty martini with blue cheese-stuffed olives. Fabulous. My salad. Here's the thing - I didn't order a salad, nor did my husband, but we got one. It was very good, though. I have no idea if we paid for it or now (I had to run over to the theatre while the group was still finishing drinks and such).   You get a ridiculous amount of food here, and it was decently good. I had the Souvlaki dinner with chicken and beef. The meat was really tender and flavorful. I think everyone in my group enjoyed their food - especially those who had a dinner-size greek salad.   Even though the food was good, I keep going back to the waitress. My friend asked for a margarita that was just Patron and lime juice, and the drink that came out was glowing like Crystal Lite. My friend said to us, "there's no way this is just lime juice" and the waitress snapped, "It is lime juice." Turns out, guess what? It wasn't just lime juice. It was sweetened lime juice. My friend told the waitress that she couldn't have sugar, to which the waitres replied, "Well, the bartender isn't going to sit there and squeeze a bunch of limes for you." I told my friend, you go over there to the bar, and I'll bet he will!   Maybe the next time I visit My Big Fat Greek Restaurant I'll receive better service.

Oh dear. I'm going to leave my review at 2 stars because I have had a decent time here, but you guys have GOT to hear this:  Some co-workers and I stopped into My Big Fat Greek Restaurant for a quick lunch last Saturday (we were working at the Herberger Festival of the Arts). It also happened to be Jami's birthday, which made the ridiculousness of our meal that much more memorable.  OK, we arrive and are seated around 12:30ish. The waitress asks, "Would you like to order drinks?" We reply yes, as we are hot and tired and ready for big glasses of water. She gives us the alcoholic drink menu.   "Oh, no ... sorry!" we say, "we want water, please."   Jami orders an iced tea, and then I say, "Do you have Coca-Cola?"   She says, "Yes, you want a Coke?"   "Yes, please. But I want water also."  "So, half and half?"  "Yes. No! Wait - I would like one glass of water and one separate glass of Coke."   Did that just happen?  Our drinks arrive, and my Coke does not taste right. We don't think it's diet, but something just isn't right. We flag down another waitress and tell her about the funky Coke. I ask, "Can you maybe taste the regular Coke to see if it's something with the machine?"   She says, "I don't really know the difference, so I don't know how much help I'll be, but I'll get you another."  She returns with a fresh Coke, and I take a sip. The table erupts with laughter based on my facial expression. It is not good. She says, "Yeah, I tasted it and it didn't taste right."   So she brought it to me anyway?  She starts to leave, and I say, "Um, can I get something else - a Mr. Pibb?"   "You want something else?"  "Well, I want SOMETHING."  The new drink arrives, and it's fine. Whew.  We order our lunch, and there is some confusion over whether or not Jami and I are sharing because we happen to be ordering the same dish. I have to explain, "I would like my own personal order of the falafel pita." Lillian orders a calzone.She's excited for something gooey and cheesy. When she orders, Lil actually points to the item she is ordering. "I"ll have the Mediterranean calzone, but without pepperoni."   Our food arrives, and the waitress is carrying a pizza. Uh oh.   "Oh, I, um, wanted a calzone."  The waitress stares. "This is what you ordered, see?" and she holds up her notepad. "No pepperoni."  "No .... I ordered a calzone, not a pizza."  "It's the same thing," she says. "Just fold it over."  Jami and I individually examine our falafel. There is no tzatziki  sauce, and we flag down another waitress who immediately gets it for us.  Now, I've had the falafel here, and it's been good before, but on this particular day it was as hard as a rock. Really. It was nearly impossible to stab it with a fork. I ate my fries. Jami started pounding one of her falafel disks on her plate, and it sounded like the falafel was ceramic.   The waitress came over to ask us if everything was ok, and I said, "Actually, the falafel is really overcooked. You might want to tell the kitchen. I've had it here before, and this is really inedible."   "Do you want something else?"   "No, thanks" I was filling up on fries and eating the pita. Really healthy, I know.  She left and then returned and said, "I asked and they said you have to crumble it in your hands."   We almost burst out laughing.  We chatted about how crazy it was that it was Jami's birthday and we were having this ridiculously bad lunch.   The waitress came back to ask us how things were, and Jami said, "Fabulous!" We were hysterical.   At least now we have a fun story, and a new office catch-phrase. When something's not quite right, we'll say, "Just fold it over."

Oh. My. Yum.  I have been wanting to visit Switch for some time now, and today was such a special treat. I scheduled a work-related meeting at Switch for an early lunch (11 am - which is right when they open during the week). Parking was a breeze (although, I have SEEN the lot about an hour later, and it's not pretty).   I was planning on getting a salad because I had heard they have a great caprese-style salad, but I was wooed by the stuffed crepes. Rosted Mushroom Crepes, to be exact. Check it out: roasted thyme, mushrooms and onion with parmesan and bechamel. Hands down, I got the award for the most amazing plate at the table.   Seriously, my meal was hands-down fantastic. I cannot wait to go back to Switch.

Mmmm.....can someone get me some baked brie from Cafe Forte, like, right now?  I had the most delicious lunch at Cafe Forte, and I felt marvelous when I left. Full and happy and warm and fuzzy. :-)  We started with the Baked Brie: brie encased in a delicate pastry served golden brown with sliced apples. What about that doesn't sound delicious?  For my entree, I opted for the 1/2 sandwich and soup, and I could have had a gallon of the soup. It was an amazing chicken soup with a sweet/savory broth. Yum. I picked the egg salad sandwich, which was also quite good.  We decided to splurge and had dessert, the Bourbon Street Bread Pudding. So sweet and decadent - it was a lovely way to finish the meal.  When you're near Old Town Scottsdale, you MUST stop into Cafe Forte. Enjoy the warm and cozy ambiance and the delicious, homey food.

I think Sweet Pea Bakery could turn me into a "Cookie Monster." My friend and I sought out the amazing PB&J cookie today (imagine two peanut butter cookies with jelly/jam in the center like a sandwich), but I also got an Oatmeal, Apricot & Walnut cookie that was SO good.   Don't worry - I shared with the folks back at work ...   MUCH better than a candy bar from the Circle K.

My friend, Heather, and I had a lovely dinner at 1130 on Saturday night. We made unnecessary reservations (don't you just hate that - you make a reservation and the place is empty??) for 5:45 PM because we were seeing ATC's Enchanted April at the Herberger, and I needed to be at the theatre by 7:15 PM.   Heather had the Raspberry Cosmo and I had the Bellini-Tini (vodka and peach schnapps). Both were delicious!  For dinner, Heather got the Pasta Rustica, and I had the Smothered Chicken. I devoured my meal. The grilled chicken was on rice pilaf and was definitely smothered in a Red Pepper cream sauce. Then, the chicken was topped with goat cheese and spinach. Yum!   Heather liked her pasta dish too, but she tasted mine and said that next time she'll get the chicken.  While I nursed my one drink, Heather enjoyed a cup of french roast coffee that came out in a French press and smelled heavenly.   As we walked over to the theatre, Heather commented, "That was a really great meal."   I agree.

A group of co-workers and I set out for Thai Elephant after I had heard about it from someone on Yelp (thank you to that person whose name now escapes me!).   I am a huge fan of Thai food, and Thai Elephant was delicious.   When we arrived around 12:30, the place was packed. We were seated within maybe 5 minutes of waiting outside, and our orders were taken quickly.   I had the Panang with beef (a personal favorite at almost any Thai restaurant), and my friends had the Drunken Noodles, Pad Thai and the Red Curry. We all loved every bite. Another friend who is not a fan of anything spicy opted for some sticky rice and spring rolls. The sticky rice was not what she had expected (it was too sticky for her) and the spring rolls were good, but she had to get an order of 4 which was too many spring rolls for her.   With our individual lunches came spring rolls, and they were perfect: thin and crispy outsides with yummy veggies inside.   What I loved most about  my Panang was the perfect level of spiciness. I hate when food is too uncomfortably spicy, but I love when my lips tingle. My lips were tingling!  The only hiccup in the meal was the bill. When the bill arrived, it was not itemized, so all we saw was the total for all five of us. Typically, we would just split it five ways (PS - gratuity was added for us as a group of five); however, two of the girls had drinks and one just had the sticky rice and spring rolls. When we asked the waitress how much just the drinks or just the sticky rice or spring rolls were, she had no idea. She left the table and went to find out. None of these items were printed in the menu, so it was a little odd. Turns out the spring rolls were $5 and the sticky rice was maybe $3 and the drink was $2, so the one poor girl who didn't like anything ended up paying the same amount the rest of us did (and we were all full and happy).   I look forward to returning to Thai Elephant, for lunch or even dinner.

I've been back to Thai Elephant two times since my first review, and I love this place even more! Part of my glee has to do with parking (twice in 2 weeks I got a metered spot across the street WITH TIME still left on the meter), but the food is also very very good.

Four co-workers set out to have a welcome back lunch for one co-worker who is a seasonal employee and has been away all summer.  The ladies were indecisive, so they decided to head over to the Arizona Center and see what piqued their interest.  While getting in the car, the conversation turned to hot dogs (long story, involves a baseball game and what was thought to be a $10 bill but actually was a $20 bill). It was determined that the only place to get a good and cheap hotdog was Costco.  In the car, freshly returned co-worker grinned ... I wouldn't mind a hotdog, actually. So, off they went to the nearest Costco to enjoy a $1.50 meal of hotdog and soda.  (Pictures were taken and will be shared in a timely fashion)  It was nice and cool inside, it was loud enough to where the ladies could be rambunctious and not be disturbing others' lunches, but not too loud as to be shouting over one another. Plus, $1.50 for lunch!! And, two ladies split a frozen yogurt (the staff at Costco gave an additional cup) and then put Coca Cola in with it to make a Coke float. Delicious!

My mother was the one who told me about Total Wine & More. I was bragging to her about my recent BevMo purchase, and she quickly set me straight.  When I first arrived at Total Wine, I thought it totally looked like Trader Joes. Inside, the place was HOPPING - people were everywhere, and there was every kind of wine and liquor imaginable there. It was awesome.  There was a tasting center at the back that I didn't take part in, though it looked like when you tasted something you got a coupon or something to purchase that wine at a discount.   I was surprised to see such a range of wines - $100 and then a couple of bottles over, $4.99. I really like the way the store is laid out, and I want to go back soon when I really have the time to peruse the entire store more thoughtfully.   I was on a mission during this visit: Find Effen vodka. I was introduced to Effen by my friend whose boyfriend is a distributor for Effen. At Safeway it's locked behind a glass case, and they make me feel like a criminal when I ask for it. Actually, they make me feel like I'm a 12 year old criminal. The checkout person actually has a look of glee when I walk up with the bottle, like he/she is poised and ready to say, "gotcha!" when they assume I can't produce ID ... which I always can. Holy cow, I'll be 30 in June. Anyway, back to Total Wine.  I was standing in front of the INSANELY LARGE selection of vodka, spied Effen, noted the FABULOUS price ($22 a bottle vs Safeway's $34 a bottle), and then one of the clerks breezed past me and said, "Try the Raspberry. You won't be sorry."   I had previously had the Black Cherry (in addition to the regular plain one), but oooh, Raspberry?? And it had a hint of vanilla. Plus, the silvery packaging had me sold. I grabbed a bottle of the plain and a bottle of the Raspberry plus some tonic and soda and hit the checkout.   This is where things got a little funky.  The woman in front of me had a few coupons with her from their grand opening advertisement. Her total was over $100, but if she hit $150 she would get to use an even better coupon. She also had a taster's coupon from the tasting bar at the back of the store. Apparently, the checkout girl rang in the taster coupon incorrectly, so when the customer wanted to add 3 bottles of wine to hit the $150 mark, the computer system was having issues.  The manager comes over, and, to be honest, the man needed, well ... a glass of wine! He was stressed to the MAX (it seemed), and he was close to berating his employee. He made the whole ordeal out to be such a DRAMA ... The customer in front of me having the issue (a lovely woman) checked out my goods and rifled through her paperwork until she came up with a coupon that I could use (an apology for the wait).   FINALLY, they got her on her way, and then it's my turn. The manager is still at the helm, and he takes one look at me and (with a smirk) says, "I'm going to need to see some ID." I have it ready to go. I'm used to this. "Oh, wow!" he exclaims.   "Yeah," I say. "It's kind of nice I guess that I'm nearing 30 and I can't seem to pass for 21. I'm not complaining though."   He rings me up and I notice my bill is barely over $50 ... and that's with tax. My coupon is for $5 off a spirit purchase of $50 or more. He's not going to be able to accept the coupon.  I ask anyway.  "No, I can't ..." he starts to say. Then maybe he realizes I was waiting in line for about 10 minutes (Really, 10 minutes. Do you know how long 10 minutes is? It's a really long time. Stand up and wait for 10 minutes. I'll bet you'll get bored and stop.). He decides to override the system and give me my $5 off coupon.  On the drive home I call 3 friends to tell them about this place, so checkout ordeal or not, I'm thrilled to have visited and intend to return.  Oh, and the Raspberry Effen is really good. :-)

I highly recommend Dr. Julie Crawford of Estrella Internal Medicine and Pediatrics. She is by far the most caring, thorough doctor I have ever had - and I've kind of had a lot of doctors. :-)  Both Dr. Crawford and Dr. Johnson are board certified internists and pediatricians, so you may be waiting in a room with Nemo on the wall - which I find charming. Perhaps it's that pediatric touch that makes her bedside manner so refreshing.

Big Buddha is a great "go to" Chinese restaurant. I highly recommend the eggplant and tofu dish -- I could just eat that and be happy. We have both dined in and ordered take out, and we are usually pretty happy.

I almost licked my plate.   Seriously.  When I saw that a Thai restaurant had gone in at Park Central where a greasy, fast-foodish Chinese place had once been, I immediately was turned off. However, when I realized it was Thai Basil, the same Thai Basil in Tempe, I was excited.   Yesterday my friend Lisa and I went to Thai Basil for lunch (with cutesy rugrat Olivia in tow as well!). I ordered my usual favorite - Panang Curry with Beef. Lisa also ordered the Panang but with chicken.  I already mentioned - I almost licked my plate - so clearly you know what I thought of my meal. I liked that they brought us a salad when we sat down, but I didn't think it was super-fabulous.  We sat outside and enjoyed the lovely weather. We were served quickly and catered to as we desired.   Lisa wished her Panang was spicier, but mine was just right.   Can't wait to go back again!

When my co-workers both had that blah feeling today, I decided we should try The Art of Soup. I had heard about from Amanda B. (thanks Amanda!) at a recent Yelp event, and had I not known where to find it, I probably wouldn't have found it!  The three soups being served today were an Asian Mushroom, Chicken with Spinach, and a Persian Yogurt soup. Jacquelyn had the Mushroom. Erin had the Chicken. I was the super-star who had ALL THREE!  No, I'm not a big piggy - I had a flight of soup! Instead of one 8oz cup/bowl of soup, I had three 4oz cups of soup, so I got to try each one. My favorite was the mushroom, but each was fantastic. The mushroom soup was today's vegan option, and it was incredibly flavorful without being over seasoned or salty. The mushrooms were the perfect consistency .... Yum!  What I loved most about getting the flight was I tend to get bored of soup. I have a few slurps and then it just gets old. However, with the flights, right when I was feeling done with one taste, I had an entirely different taste waiting for me.    And, I honestly would have never selected the Persian Yogurt soup, but I was glad I got to try it. It was very refreshing (I saved it for last), especially on a hot day. The combination of dill and mint was fragrant and fresh, while the sweetness of the raisins complemented the bitterness of the radishes and walnuts sprinkled on top.    Janet, the owner, told me all about where the recipe for the Persian Yogurt soup came from, and she also shared with us that all of the ingredients wer purchased at the farmer's market that very morning.   For dessert, we indulged in amazing chocolate chip cookies from Urban Cookies .... Yum ..... But perhaps that's another review!

Dillon's Grand is one of those staple restaurants for our family. My parents and grandmother live in Sun City Grand, and at one point my husband and I lived in Surprise - this was back when there were not many food options in Surprise. We had Dillon's and Jack in the Box.   I took my grandma to Dillon's today for her birthday lunch. She loves the onion rings, and they give dessert for free on birthdays.  My children have been to Dillon's so many times - the first time they were less than a month old - so they walk in like they own the place (in fact, my son "Dylan" thinks it's named after him).    The waitstaff there was really young, which amuses me at a place that is packed with senior citizens. My dad (who joined us as well) ordered an Amber Bock ($2 draft beers at lunchtime) and it took FOREVER to arrive because our waitress was not old enough to serve it.   One of my kids had chicken strips and the other had ribs, and those came out very quickly because we ordered them with our appetizer (onion rings - they are delicious, and not just because you can get a coupon for a free 1/2 order in the newspaper right outside the front door).   Then, it was as if the waitress forgot that we were going to order. I started to think maybe she thought the adults weren't planning on eating. Eventually, she came on over.   My dad and I ordered the burnt ends with the mild BBQ sauce, though I had mashed potatoes and asparagus while he had the BBQ beans and asparagus. I saw another review knocking the burnt ends - I like this dish. I like ribs, but I hate the mess. With the burnt ends, it's like someone has cut the meat off of the rib for you, so there's no work - only yum!  Grandma got chicken fingers as well. :-)  Then the waitress brought out a gigantic brownie sundae that we all shared.

My husband urged me to check out Azure Reflexology Massage because they had a huge banner outside that advertised a one-hour massage for only $25. I wandered in this afternoon to ask a few questions and wound up staying for a massage - who knew?   When I walked into the building, the reception area was small but peaceful. A young woman sat at a desk and greeted me. She explained a bit about the type of massage they offer, and after fielding a few questions from me, she got me in for my massage within a few minutes.   Reflexology is an ancient healing art based on the principles that there are reflexes in the hands and feet that correspond to every part, organ and gland in the body.  I had never had a reflexology massage before this.  I walked through the curtain to a large, open room. It was dimly lit with dark wood floors, olive green walls and ceiling, and soothing music played softly. There were twelve chairs in the room - large, leather reclining chairs. I was brought to one. My therapist didn't speak to me except to say, at different points, "here," "very skinny," and "you play yoga?"  When I sat down, I took off my shoes and socks and put my feet into a tub of warm herbal water. He reclined my chair and placed a blanket over my body. As my feet soaked, he began massaging my arms starting at my shoulder and working down to my fingertips.   After my arms, he massaged my entire head and neck. When I say head, I mean my entire head - temples, forehead, jaw, ears. No one has ever massaged my ears before!   Next, my feet. He dried off my feet and, using creme, spent a good 20 minutes massaging my feet and legs. My legs and feet were scrubbed with wet, warm towels and then dried.  Time to flip over. The chair had a place for my face to rest so he could work on my back. The trigger-point therapy he did on my shoulder blades was fabulous and much needed.   Pros 1. I didn't have to remove my clothing 2. It was only $25 for an hour (a full hour) 3. I felt great afterwards 4. They have 6 therapists now, so you can literally book all 6 at once and go with 5 of your friends  Cons 1. No one ever asked me about my personal history (aches and pains, etc) 2. Occasionally my therapist chatted with another therapist in another language, which was sort of disruptive. 3. You're in a big room with other peopl getting massages, so you can hear other people getting popped and slapped, etc. (that sounds worse than it is ....)  When all is said and done, I recommend  Azure Reflexology and Massage, but just know it's not a traditional "massage," that you would receive at a place like Massage Envy. Just be sure to wear comfortable clothing and be prepared to bend!

I had another great experience at Azure Reflexology Massage today. I was so relaxed, I would have loved to stay in the dark, peaceful room and sleep for a bit afterwards!!  I had the exact same treatment/protocol from my last visit ... I love that I feel limber and relaxed afterwards and not "beaten up."

A new Robecks opened in my neck of the woods, and I wasn't super-thrilled at first because I am a die-hard Jamba Juice junkie. I know it sounds silly because juice is juice, but whenever I get a smoothie from somewhere other than Jamba, I am always disappointed.   Robecks did not disappoint. Not once did I think about Jamba as I enjoyed my smoothie - on 2 separate occassions.   The first smoothie to please me was the Raspberry Romance: raspberry juice, raspberries, strawberries, bananas, non-fat yogurt and ice. Not too tart, and not too creamy.   Less than a week later, I dragged my sniffly self in for a pick-me-up and ordered the Dr. Robeks off of their Power Smoothie Menu: freshly squeezed orange juice, raspberries, strawberries, raspberry sherbet, ice, + Immunibek and Vitabek.   Something that Robeks offers that I haven't tried yet are shakes and frozen yogurt as well as sandwiches and salads.  There's a nice little patio for outdoor seating, otherwise, you've got to take it to go.   Also, all summer they are doing a "buy one for yourself get one free for your kid" special on Mondays. I think it will be a weekly event for us!

This afternoon I stopped into a new Berrygood shop in my neighborhood. I saw the sign that read "Grand Opening," and it called to me for some odd reason. Suddenly I was back in junior high school enjoying strawberry frozen yogurt in a strawberry waffle cone. Ahhh .... Which is so odd because for the most part I think frozen yogurt tastes like underachieving ice-cream. But, I do have a romanticized memory of TCBY.  When I walked into Berrygood, my first thought was, 'Well, this certainly isn't TCBY.'  I must have looked stunned because a bright and energetic young girl hopped right over to me and asked if this was my first time in.  "Yes ...."  I got the tour.   Basically, all of the frozen yogurt machines are out front and are self-serve. Next, there is a topping bar. Your customized creation is weighed. The huge sign over the back wall reads, "$0.39 per ounce."  The yogurt flavors were strawberry, raspberry, mango, (a few other berry-type flavors I cannot recall), green tea, and "premium." To be honest when I saw the word "premium" I thought of gasoline. I asked the girl, "So, it's just plain yogurt?"   "Well, the rest are sweet, and this one is more tart. All of the other flavors have the premium as a base."  So, yes .... plain  yogurt. But cold.  She gave me a sample cup and spoon, and I was able to serve myself samples of whatever I wanted. I tried the mango and the strawberry. They were both good but not what I was expecting at all. This wasn't TCBY ... Instead of being creamy, it was, well ... It tasted like half-melted actually frozen yogurt. You know, like if you were to freeze your Yoplait and then let it defrost about 75%.   The girl told me it was healthier than other frozen treats, but she didn't explain why. The minimal signage on the walls shouted, "No Fat! Fewer Calories!"  Of course, you can kill that statement with the topping bar. The assortment ranged from M&Ms and crushed Oreos to dried fruits and almond slivers.   I decided to go for a smoothie. I had to hurry, so I needed something that I could easily consume in the car. I ordered the triple berry smoothie which consisted of yogurt (not the premium, but another kind of harder yogurt), ice, fresh strawberries (not frozen) and I think raspberries and blueberries ... and strawberry juice.   I watched her make it. I felt bad for her .... It was awkward.   My smoothie was less smooth and more icy than I like .... though I probably like things that are fatty and bad for me.   I don't know that I'll visit Berrygood again. It really wasn't berry good.   And .... While I was there I picked up a pamphlet and noticed a spelling error: "comming soon."  It bugged me.  Then later tonight I went to the website to try to find the address of this new shop (on the corner of Estrella Pkwy and McDowell) and I found MORE errors:  "Store Lacation"  "Lake Habasu" "Happy Balley"  The former English teacher in me shudders ....

While I appreciate the addition of a sushi restaurant out here in Goodyear, I must say that I'd just rather drive to Westgate and eat at Be Sushi if I want sushi.   My husband and I dropped in for a quick dinner the other day before grocery shopping. He can't eat much fish at all, so he ordered some gyoza and a tempura shrimp roll. He enjoyed his food, but I tasted the gyoza and it was more deep fried than pan fried, which I did not like.   I had the spicy tuna roll and the veggie tempura. The tuna roll was fine - not bad, but not notably good. The tempura was good, and I was surprised (and pleased) to find eggplant among the veggie-ness.  The water they served us was horrendous. I generally just like water with sushi, unless I am drinking a beer (which I wasn't in the mood for that night). I had to order an iced-tea to get the horrible taste of the water out of my mouth.  The only other criticism I have for the place is that their servingware looks like, well, hand-me-downs. I kept thinking, 'Didn't this place just recently open?' It had that "hole-in-the-wall" feel inside that is only quaint to me when the place A) has been around forever and B) is the most delicious thing ever.   So, to quote Yelp, "Meh. I've experienced better."

My family and I cruised over to E's for lunch today. We're residents up in Estrella, but we'd never tried E's. The restaurant there has undergone many changes over the years, and the food was never something to rave about - until now.  My husband and I split a stromboli filled with mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, capicolla, black olives and onions. I would have preferred more veggies, but my husband does not, so this was a compromise. It took a while for our food to arrive, but that was because they were making the stromboli from scratch back in the kitchen. A stromboli is like a calzone, except the calzone has ricotta cheese inside and the stromboli has mozzarella. When the waitress brought it out, it was MASSIVE - plenty for the two of us, plus she brought out two dipping bowls of warm marinara sauce for us each to have our own.   The kids shared the youth-sized chicken strips and french fries. One order came with six large pieces of breaded and fried chicken. I tasted a bite, and it was likely the best chicken strip I have ever had. The kids also had milk, and that came out in large styrofoam cups with lids and straws (like 16 oz of milk each).   The food was delicious, there was plenty to go around, and the price was very inexpensive. There aren't many place where a family of four can sit down for a good meal together for a whopping total of $20!   The only criticism I have is that the waitress seemed extremely untrained. When we came in around noon-ish, the place was maybe half-full, and they looked frantic (though there seemed to be plenty of staff around). We were seated sort of haphazardly, and eventually someone tossed a couple of menus on the table. We asked for crayons for the kids (we knew they had coloring things there), but those didn't come for a good 15 minutes - at which time my twin 4 year olds were jumping around the restaurant, being, well, obnoxious young children who don't know how to sit and wait for food that long. When she did bring them over, she said that the chicken strips were ready, but she was waiting to bring them out until the stromboli was done. We told her, no, please bring the kids' food out if it's ready, thanks.   Next week, we may try to get there earlier and try breakfast/brunch!

Ladies, are you looking for gel nails? The salons call the real, true gel nails "gel gels." I have gone into and called countless nail salons looking for these "gel gel" nail services, only I didn't know the code word before today.   If you ask for "gel nails," they sit you down and put a "gel powder" on your nails and then follow up with the "gel" topcoat. These are not gel nails.   In the Goodyear/Avondale/Litchfield Park area, I have found 3 salons to offer true gel nails. And, a warning, 2 of the 3 salons only have 1 technician who can provide this service.  What to do?  Go to Vivian Nails.  Vivian Lee, the owner, did my nails today, but she said all of her staff can also offer the same service.   Discounts are offered for seniors, students, school faculty and military. Also, since it was my first time in, she gave me 10% off.

Mid-week a few co-workers and I had a great night at Crush. We instantly loved the atmosphere and got comfy in a velvety plushy booth near the bar. There were maybe four or five small parties present, and the place was packed. And, it was a Wednesday night ... I'd hate to see the place on a Friday night.   I was going to get a glass of wine, but when the waitress told us about their signature drink, the crush, I knew I had to try it. Champagne with a lavender-infused liquor? Yum! I loved it.   Instead of going into Christopher's and order dinner, we decided to snack on some small plates. First, we enjoyed a cheese platter - chef's choice. My favorite selection was the Farmhouse Chevre, a creamy goat cheese. The other three selections were very good as well, but the Chevre was by far my favorite.  We also snacked on a bowl of house marinated olives, which were enjoyed by all three of us. They were very good, but you do have to love the olive to enjoy ...  The very best was the pizza, which was delicious and different. The crust had the savory flavor of foccaccia, but it was light and airy like a pastry. We had our pizza with wild mushrooms and shallots. It was unbelievably good. I can't wait to go back and have it again soon!  I'm looking forward to grabbing some girlfriends for a bit of shopping at the Biltmore Fashion Park and then drinks at Crush!

Let me be honest.   I hate going to the dentist. It's not that I'm afraid it's going to hurt (frankly, it just never has), it's just that I am an over-achiever by nature, and yet I have felt all my life like my teeth are under-achieving. I usually feel quite naked, lying there, basically saying, "Go ahead, scrutinize me! Point out all of my flaws! That's right - I never floss! Never!"  Does this sound like you? If so, you are going to love Dr. Wellman and his staff at Estrella Mountain Dentistry.  Before I saw Dr. Wellman, I filled out the standard medical paperwork, but there were also some questions about how I felt about my smile, and how I felt about dentist visits in general. Since I was brutally honest, the staff there embraced my neuroticism and made me feel great. It helps that I have a fairly clean bill of health - no cavities!  I scheduled two separate visits. The first was with Dr. Wellman, and the second was with the dental hygenist. It's usually the cleaning that makes me cringe, but this was about as lovely as a teeth cleaning can get. And, I got to watch a movie! Yep, there are flat screen tvs on the ceiling, and I had my choice of comedies and dramas. I only got to see the first 30 minutes of "The Wedding Planner," but that was fine by me!   I found Estrella Mountain Dentistry by way of an advertisement sent to my home, offering free whitening for life, so long as I responded to the ad within a certain period of time. As long as I continue to go in for my bi-yearly check-ups and cleanings, I will receive the whitening gel.  I highly recommend Estrella Mountain Dentistry if you are in the area. I also made an appointment to bring my twins in for their check-ups. It was such a comforting environment that I think they will do just fine. Plus, they have Blue's Clues and Dora and all the other fabulous kid shows that are sure to delight my four-year-olds!

Let me be honest. I'm kind of a snob. Maybe that's a dramatic statement to make, I don't know ... All I can say is I never had an interest in going to the old Willo House, which to me looked like a run-down old shack. OK, there it is! Judge me if you will!   I stopped into Hob Nobs on my way to Tucson with a colleague who needed a pick-me-up. Having already had my coffee that morning, I tagged along with the intention of leaving empty-handed. That did not happen.  Everything smelled so delicious, and the environment was warm and cozy ... I ordered a chai tea.   While the barista made our drinks, my colleague was chit-chatting with someone else who perhaps was the owner, or at least the manager. "Waffles?" she asked me. "Oatmeal?" She had a huge grin and was clearly joking with me. The staff member/owner/manager said, "the oatmeal comes with bananas on top."   "Bananas?" I asked.   They laughed at me.  "Well," I said, "If I can take it to go and actually eat it in the car, I'll have some."   He made my oatmeal with butter and brown sugar, then topped it with sliced bananas and strawberries. I then added a splurge of half and half.   It was the best oatmeal I have ever had.

I had a great time at District last night. After a long day/night of work at the theatre, we walked across the street to District for a glass of wine and something warm and yummy to eat. Apparently, "Happy Hour" lasts all day on Fridays. A few of us took advantage of their specials and enjoyed the cheese plate, the mac & cheese (yum) and the sweet potato fries.   I had previously been to District for dinner and enjoyed the crab cakes. This was my first time going there just for the bar area. On Friday night, the place was hoppin'. People seemed to be coming from either the Suns game or the Arizona Theatre Company production across the street.   Great ambiance. Nice wine list. Yummy food.

I needed a pedicure today after work like no other. Pretty Nails & Spa by BN had been calling to me - it's in a brand new building and that "Grand Opening - Special!" sign reeled me in.  Since the place is new, everything is pristine inside. I climbed up into the decadent massage chair - they have "Human Touch" massage chairs there, and I was impressed. My chiropractor uses the same brand of massage chairs. They're great because they relax your back without being too abrasive. Sometimes I sit in a massage chair during a pedicure and the next day I feel like someone has been beating me.   Anyway - this place was great. The chairs were wonderful, and the staff was very sweet (and spoke English the entire time - seriously! No chit-chatting amongst themselves). Relaxation music played throughout the shop, and it just smelled clean and fresh inside - not chemically or overly fragrant.  I honestly nearly fell asleep during my foot and calf massage, and I was so relaxed and peaceful that after my toes were polished, she just let me lie there in the glorious chair with my eyes closed.   Heaven!

My feet have not been this soft in years!  I echo all of my previews accolades, but I have to add: Get the callous remover. You will not be sorry!!   I have had callous remover at other places, but the nail tech at Pretty Nails & Spa filed my heels after the remover and (brace yourself) the dead skin fell off like eraser dust. It was totally disgusting and yet fabulous at the same time.  I'm done trying out new pedi places ... this one's a keeper!!

Talk about a decadent meal!   We had a great Girls' Night Out dinner at BLT Steak ... wonderful food, great company ... one of those really fun nights.  I was surprised when we were seated and immediately served bread with chicken liver pate - not as good as my mom's (hi Mom!), but it was made with red wine, and it was quite good. Meanwhile, we perused the menu. Most of us opted for their special Prix Fixe meal of the night, which was a great value. For $50 you had a choice of appetizer, entree, side and dessert. I opted for a seared ahi tuna salad, a bone-in jalapeno-infused filet mignon, and baked artichoke. This was an amazing deal considering the a la carte price of each item. For example, we're still reeling from the Kobe beef on the menu that was listed at $26 per ounce. Per ounce?!?! I'm sure it's amazing, but ... wow ...  My tuna salad was delicious, and my steak was really great. I ended up coming home with half of it (yummy burritos for husband the next day!). The baked artichoke was just OK. My friend had the fingerling potatoes, which were really fabulous.   For dessert, we each chose something different and shared. By far, the favorite of the table was the apricot tart. It had a blackberry sauce drizzled around it and a small scoop of pistachio ice cream. Something about the apricot, the flaky tart crust, the tart blackberry sauce and the sweet (yet salty) pistachio ice cream was just wonderful. We also tried the chocolate tart (VERY rich ... almost like eating straight cocoa powder), the strawberry souffle (honestly, just OK, despite a rave review from our waiter) and an angel food cake item with raspberry sauce that just paled in comparison.   Their wine selection was quite extensive ... Oh, I almost forgot! After we ordered, we were served popovers that were so wonderful. The fresh butter and sea salt on the eggy, crusty dough was delicious. AND, we were also served espresso petit fours that were so good, we really didn't need dessert after one of those. Yum!   All in all, a great meal, but definitely on the pricey side .... If you go, make an event out of it. We were there for hours, and it was a great environment to chat and giggle and eat. :-)

One time, I drove around for 3 months with clothes in my trunk that I kept intending to take to the dry cleaner. I would go so rarely, that every few months I would have a happy reunion in my closet with slacks I hadn't seen in almost an entire season.   Besides being a teensy bit lazy, I am just so busy during the week, making it impossible for me to get those M-F, 9-5 errands done.   This is why I love Dry Cleaning Home Express.  My days are Mondays and Thursdays. That means, I put my bag of clothes outside on Monday morning, and viola, come Thursday evening when I get home from work, my clean clothes are bagged and hung (on the back of my gate, as I requested).   During the summer, I don't wear a lot of clothes that require dry cleaning, so I am an "on call" customer. I call when I need a pick-up. In the cooler months, I need the service more regularly, so I can switch over to a regular M & Th customer.   When I first considered using Dry Cleaning Home Express, I assumed the prices would be much higher than another dry cleaner - I honestly haven't noticed that the prices are inflated, and the door-to-door service is worth any extra $$, for sure.   The price list is all on the website, so check it out!

This morning, a co-worker and I visited Cupz N' Crepes for a working breakfast. We frequently use the Enterprise Rent-a-Car located a few doors down, and had noticed the cute signage for the new shop. Instead of hitting a Starbucks or Einstein's, we decided to take a peek at this new place.  What a treat! I enjoyed a sweet crepe filled with Nutella and bananas and topped with fresh whipped cream. It was delicious! My co-worker had the Nutella, bananas and strawberries - also fabulous.   In addition, we had drinks. I had a white mocha and my co-worker had a chai tea.   Besides sweet crepes, they also offer savory crepes, salads and bagels.   The entire place was comfy and cozy with great seating and free Wi-Fi.

Today we had an office fiesta, thanks in part to America's Taco Shop.   Some lessons learned, but overall the consensus was YUM.   In the future we will order online and travel with a pick-up buddy (which is what we have to do for Pei Wei as well, but that's another review). Poor Jami went to pick up our orders by herself and had to park far away and walk in the 100-and-who-knows-what degree heat.   I had the carne asada tacos, and I opted for the roasted jalapenos on top. These tacos were so delicious ..... You cannot go wrong with their carne asada.   Everyone else also ooohed and ahhhed over their entrees. The chips and guacamole were also delicious.   I cannot wait to get take out from here again.

Dinner at Sens was, hands-down, one of the best meal-experiences we've had here in Phoenix. Four of us (2 couples) made reservations at Sens for 6:30 on a Saturday night. It was a good thing we had reservations, because shortly thereafter, the place was packed.   Sens is not a place to grab a quick bite; rather, this is the place to go to use all of your senses (get it?) - taste, smell, see, hear ... the music was great, the lighting was nice, and the food was amazing.   We started off with some drinks. I was intrigued by their infused Shochu ( a Japanese vodka). To start, I tried the lychee-infused Shochu with club soda. My friend also enjoyed the lychee Shochu but with club soda and a splash of cranberry juice, while her husband tried the logan Shochu chilled and straight up. My daring husband opted for the chili-infused Shochu, which was incredibly spicy. Not long thereafter, the waitress asked if he wanted it made into a martini, so he chose the "Hot and Dirty" (which was like a dirty martini, but made with the hot chili Shochu). Later, I tried the ginger-infused Shochu and the Lemongrass-infused Shochu. GREAT DRINKS!   To eat, we dined like royalty on the following dishes:  La Nho, lemongrass marinated beef wrapped in grape leaves.  Volcano Flamed, thinly sliced beef seared on hot stone. The beef actually comes to the table raw, and you literally cook it for 40 seconds per side on a hot stone. Very cool.  Shu Mai, wasabi pork and shrimp dumplings. Very tasty, with a kick!  Papaya Mango Salad with shrimp in a lime vinegarette.  Wasabi Soy chicken breast, marinated and served with rock salt wasabi.  Lemongrass Soy chicken breast - this was probably my favorite dish!  Spicy Wonton filled with sauteed chicken and pepperjack cheese.  Red curry tofu - We ordered a side of steamed rice, which you really have to do in order to enjoy all of the amazing sauce in this claypot dish.  and, finally, Quail seasoned with aromatic rock salt.  I would order everything all over again. I loved that we got to try a little bit of everything, and we had such a fun time eating, chatting, drinking ... It was hard to leave!   On a side note, I had the opportunity to chat with owner/executive chef Johnny Chu about the creation of Sens vs what's happening over at the restaurant-formerly-known-as-Fate. Johnny has taken the old Fate menu and infused it into the Sens lunch menu. He's also not involved with what used to be Fate (they are now calling it 905), so if you loved the old Fate, you need to find your way over to Sens!

The entire time I was shopping at the new Basha's, I wished I was at Safeway ... or even Albertson's.   The Safeway I usually shop at (located at Estrella Parkway and Van Buren) feels so much more decadent. I apologize for being vague, but I can't quite put my finger on it. I must sound ridiculous going on and on about a grocery store.   Basha's had a cold, stark feeling. The flow felt off - liquor right next to produce?   I know a few of my friends have been looking forward to this Basha's since they have a kiddie drop-off area. Fortunately, I usually have the luxury of shopping alone. Plus, I also worry about the kiddie drop-off being a total germ-fest.   I guess when I go grocery shopping and spend more than $100 at a time, I want to feel like I had a lovely retail experience ... not that grocery shopping needs to feel like shoe shopping ... but it helps!

One word: Yum.   My co-workers and I took a breather from a crazy day at work and decided to enjoy a relaxing lunch at PastaBAR. All three of us got different pastas, and we each tasted each other's dishes ... all three were spectacular. I can't wait to go back again!  I enjoyed the Gnocchi alla Lupa...sweet and spicy fennel sausage ragu ... The gnocchi was incredibly fluffy and airy - unlike any gnocchi I've had before.   My co-workers had Orecchiette con Salsiccia... home-made sausage, greens, Pecorino ... (very good) and Chitarra alla Amatriciana...guanciale, onion, parsley, hot pepper, tomato ... (extra yum! I will likely get this for myself on my next visit).   The place was rather empty for lunch today, which I hope is an anomaly.   It's a little on the pricey side for lunch, but worth the splurge when you're in the mood for something warm and delicious with a homey touch.

Oh PastaBAR - how I do love thee!  I had a marvelous pre-theatre dinner at PastaBAR last Saturday evening, and I wish I could beam myself there right now and relive the meal.  We started with drinks. Go for their daily infusions. I had strawberry, and it was delicious.   Next, we shared their version of a caprese salad: Buffalo Mozzarella, basil pesto, heirloom tomatoes, anchovies. The mozzarella melts in your mouth!  For my entree, I had the Chitarra alla Amatriciana...guanciale, onion, parsley, hot pepper, tomato ... Yum!   If you're in the downtown Phoenix area, please take advantage of this local gem!

In belated celebration of our friend's birthday (Happy Birthday, Chad!) four of us went to dinner at Verrado Grille. Living out in Estrella in Goodyear, it's so great when you can have such a lovely dining experience close to home.  We chose to sit in the bar, which allowed us to chit-chat with the bartender, Desi, as she prepared our drinks throughout the evening. If you like margaritas, go to Verrado Grille, ask for Desi, and request her "tequila lover's margarita." It's unlike any other margarita I've had, with muddled lime, lemon and orange. It's strong but very good, and she refuses to give you a straw because it's meant to be sipped. Chad opted for a mojito instead, and it was really very good as well. There was so much mint in the mojito, the glass was almost completely green.   To start we shared the spinach and artichoke dip, which was served with yummy chips that had a sweet/spicy seasoning on them.   My entree was the herb-roasted chicken. The two chicken breasts were served with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans, plus an herbed chicken au jus that I didn't touch because the chicken was so flavorful, I never even thought about it. By the way, the chicken they use are all raised without hormones or antibiotics and are fed a vegetarian grain diet.  My friend, Cara, also had the herb-roasted chicken (she had also had it just 2 days before and loved it that much - that's how good it is!). Meanwhile, the men had St. Louis-style barbeque baby back ribs, which came with cole slaw and french fries.   For dessert, the guys shared a cookie-dough cheesecake and Cara and I had the brownie berry parfait. Think brownie sundae but packed with fresh berries. Yum!   We had a great meal, fabulous drinks, and we didn't have to drive for an hour!  And, if you have kids, they offer free babysitting on Thursday nights!

This is MY neighborhood market.   Actually, it's on the way to my neighborhood, which is why I love stopping here on my way home from work. Hop off the I-10 at Avondale, and hit Fresh & Easy before heading home to Estrella.   Fresh & Easy used to be my go-to for grabbing a quick lunch or dinner item or a bottle of wine for a gathering, but I recently discovered that they have great deals on the cereal my kids love.   Also, I love their organic peanut butter.

This cute little nail salon recently opened in the Super Target shopping center on the northeast corner of Yuma & Cotton Lane. When I walked in, I was excited to see a nail tech I've had before at another salon.   Today's visit was arduous. I needed some gel polish removed from my nails. My tech, Jade, was really fabulous and took very good care of my nails. It would have been easy to sand them down to nothing, but she was very careful and my nails look perfect (after a fresh manicure, of course).   While I was there, Jade showed me how she had been practicing making the AZ Cardinal logo on some nail tips. I was amazed - I would have sworn they were decals on the nails. Nope - she hand painted them! We started brainstorming other logos she could do, and with the help of her iphone, we had run searching the net for pictures. She's super-talented, so if you have a burning desire to have something extra special painted on your nails, bring her a photo or a web link.

I've been wanting to try La Hacienda for a while, and last night we FINALLY made it happen. First of all, the Scottsdale Princess is gorgeous. I wish I wasn't such a party pooper because it would have been great to hang out there and have a drink at the outdoor bar. Next time.  I started my meal with the Elderflower margarita. 1800 blanco tequila, St. Germain, and fresh sour on the rocks. It was incredibly smooth, but a teensy bit too sweet for me. Next time I'll probably stick with a more traditional option.  We ordered the guacamole sampler, which came with three different types of guac: Pomegranate, Spicy Crab, and Pepita. All were delicious, but I think the pomegranate was the table favorite (we had it prepared without walnuts due to allergies).  The chips were freshly made and so delicious I almost didn't have room for my entree.  I enjoyed the Pollo en Mole Rojo, and it was really very good. The chicken was tender, and I loved their mole sauce. I also liked the plantains that accompanied the dish (I love plantains). My husband was less-than-impressed with his Enchiladas Verdes, but I think he forgot what tomatillos taste like.  For dessert, we experienced their flaming coffees. This is an experience unto itself, and if you happen to see someone getting one, you won't be able to leave the restaurant without sampling one yourself. I can still smell the cinnamon. Yum.

How long have we waited for Pita to open downtown? How long? Boy, oh boy, oh boy!! It was a glorious day when we (my lovely co-workers at Arizona Theatre Company) heard the news that Pita Jungle was open for business. Of course, the best part is that we can walk there from our office on 5th Ave and Roosevelt. Also fabulous is the food! Delicious food!  I've been for lunch a few times now, and I want to do a happy hour there soon. I keep eyeing the bar area ....   My favorite thing to do at Pita is split two specific items with a friend.   1. Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus (the small platter is plenty!): Chickpea puree with cilantro, jalapeno and tahini sauce, seasoned with fresh garlic and lemon juice and topped with pico de gallo.   and  2.  The Glazed-Chicken Lavosh Pizza: crispy wood-fired Lavosh crust topped with honey mustard glazed chicken, wood-fired onions, cheddar, feta, mozarella and herbs.  I don't even like hummus THAT much, but I really love THIS hummus.   The only thing I have had (so far) that I wasn't crazy about was the Taboule salad, but maybe I'm just not a Taboule kind of gal?  Overall, pretty delicious. I've noticed that they're still working out some issues. There have been a few customer service inconsistencies, but I'm still in the "grateful they're open" stage.

The one redeeming thing Eye Masters in Goodyear did for me was they got me in. I called to make an appointment, and got in that day.   Everything else was downhill from there.   I had to bring my twin boys (age 6) to my appointment - I know, not ideal, but what was I to do? I had them all set up with their Leapster systems and plenty of games to keep them occupied. They were in the room with me, and as soon as the optometrist entered the room, he was PISSY. He wanted the kids to turn off the games, which was the only thing keeping them from getting into who knows what kind of trouble. Um, do you WANT my money? I'm sure I can find one or two or 20 other cheap-o vision centers around the West Valley who won't mind the "blippity-bleep" of my kids' education gaming system. So, my kids had to turn the games off, and then they were very curious about what this man was doing to their mom. So, they stood up, not getting near me, but stood up to see and he barked "sit down in the chairs!" I'm going to guess he doesn't have kids ... and I shudder to think what he would do with a child patient.   He finishes my exam - I need reading glasses - and I go check out.. While I'm checking out, he flips out at the clerk because she tells him he has another patient (sitting RIGHT THERE WAITING) and he barks, "I'm walking out this door at 5:30!"   Yeah, we won't be returning ...   P.S. This is kind of gross, so I'm sorry. It's so juvenile, but it brought me a little bit of joy ... Before we left, one of my kids had to use the restroom. Well, he didn't just go - he REALLY stunk up the joint. Normally I would have been a bit embarrassed, but I was like, "Take that Dr. Rudey-Ruderson!"

I highly recommend the folks at Arizona Collision Specialists. Unfortunately, I was rear-ended exiting the 101. Allstate recommended this shop, and I was pleased with both the customer service and body work they did on my car.

Can you say blissful?   That's how I'll describe my meal at Bliss. Then again, I DID have the loaded mac & cheese for lunch.   I had a lunch meeting today at Bliss, and I look forward to returning there soon. I mean, really .... the menu screams comfort food, and I am the queen of comfort food. My ooey-gooey mac & cheese was so creamy and delicious with a grown-up twist that made it a just  little bit sophisticated.   At noon on a Monday the place was fairly empty; although, free parking was scarce. I hadn't been in the area since the original Fate closed, so I was surprised to see parking meters along most of the side streets. Bring your loose change!

I keep returning to The Herb Box because every time I try something new and love my meal.   First of all, EVERY time I HAVE to have the Korean cauliflower. Do not miss this appetizer. It's a must.  On my last dinner visit, my waiter sold me on the Thai BBQ Baby Back Ribs, which come with a green apple slaw, jicama & watercress, and smoked gouda mac-n-cheese. Yum.The green apple slaw was the perfect contrast to the rich mac-n-cheese, and the ribs were ridiculously tender.   For lunch my go-to has been the Urban Market Steak Salad (grilled beef tenderloin, ancho-bourbon demi, watercress, avocado, sweet red pepper, bacon, sugared pecan, sweet dried corn, gorgonzola), but my co-worker had the Chicken-Avocado Chop Salad and said it was the best salad he'd ever had. Really. Direct quote: "This is the best salad I've ever had." So, I might need to try that next time.

One of my all time favorite spots in Phoenix! The best things at The Arrogant Butcher are the Polish Fix and the pretzel rolls with fondue.   My friends and I dream about the polish fix. Perfectly crushed ice, lemon juice, macerated raspberries, and vodka. Perfection!   I'm a fan of the sweet potato tortelli. Last time I was there, I added scallops to the entree, which were great.

LOVE the carne asada tacos, which come in corn tortillas and are served with guacamole, caramelized onions and lettuce. I usually order three, and after my second I start to think maybe my eyes were bigger than my stomach, but then I polish the third off anyway.   The guacamole is awesome -- I split an order of chips and guac, and between our meals and that as a side, it was too much. So, I took the guacamole back to the office, and it was still great the next day.

A good friend of mine has been going to Ann for years, and I am so glad I finally listened to her and saw Ann myself! Let's face it, no one enjoys bikini waxes. But with Ann, they are quick and as pain-free as possible. I really like the products she uses, and her location in Old Town is very convenient.

Up until yesterday I had only ever experienced Ann's amazing waxing services. Now I can say I have been truly pampered by one of Ann's wonderful aromatherapy facials. My skin feels fabulous! I left Ann feeling like I was floating on a cloud.

I can't wait to return. A co-worker and I stopped in for a late dinner one night after a work event at the Ritz. We split the ahi tuna salad and a flatbread pizza with mushrooms, arugula, caramelized onions and goat cheese (everything is better with goat cheese). Both were great, and the salad was very fresh and flavorful. I look forward to returning for round two! I wasn't able to indulge in wine, but the wine list was extensive.

Galaxy Cleaners has become my go-to dry cleaner. I've been extremely pleased with their services. Drop off and pick up are quick and easy. I've read some reviews about "rude morning staff," but I have never experienced this. The woman who serves me in the morning is always pleasant, and I always greet her and wish her a wonderful rest of her day. I imagine her day starts quite a bit earlier than mine!!

If I'm basing this review on the menu alone, I'd give it 5 stars. Every time I walk into Original ChopShop, I am overwhelmed by lunch possibilities. My favorite meal so far is the protein bowl. I get the brown rice, tofu, and the Thai peanut sauce. I also love their assortment of iced teas, particularly the blackberry black tea.   My only complaint about Original ChopShop is that service tends to be very slow, and my friend and I never seem to get our food even close to the same time, so there's always that awkward situation of waiting for your friend's food to arrive.

I'm SO HAPPY to have a place to get pho in Goodyear. When you're feeling a bit ill or down in the dumps, a big bowl of piping hot broth, noodles, meat, veggies and aromatics can soothe your soul. I am a fan of the pho ga, which is their chicken pho, except I also add veggies to the bowl (cabbage, broccoli, and carrots). While I wish the place was bigger and offered more seating, I haven't yet not been able to be seated.

Three friends and I enjoyed a fantastic evening out earlier this week at The Clever Koi. We started at the bar where I abandoned my usual libations and ordered The Enabler, which is described as hickory-infused 12 year old whisky, grilled lemon juice, lapsang maple syrup and burlesque bitters. It was so good that I had another.   For dinner, the four of us decided to just order a ton of stuff and share family style. Armed with our chopsticks, we were reminiscent of a family dinner in which the fastest eaters get to, well, eat. You snooze, you lose! Luckily we ordered in phases, so we continually had food coming. We thought at first we were insane for ordering so much, but we managed to pretty much polish our plates.  Here's what we had:  5 stars -- The beet salad with mizuna, shaved cucumber, pickled ginger, tempura bean curd and lemongrass vinaigrette.    5 stars -- The salt and pepper shrimp with scallops and XO sauce.  5 stars -- The long beans with crispy duck tongue and XO aioli.  Steamed Bun: Schreiner's lop chong with daikon slaw and spicy Japanese mustard (can't star it because I didn't get a bite!!)  5 stars -- Smoked "pig face" dumplings with kimchi and pickled peppers.  5 stars -- Kimchi duck fried rice  5 stars -- Massaman udon noodles with red curry, roasted duck, fingerling potatoes, pickled peppers, peanuts and crispy cilantro.  (MY FAVORITE OF THE NIGHT!!)  5 stars -- Ramen with roasted pork, house bacon, pickled mustard greens, shiitake mushrooms, bean sprouts and soft-boiled egg.  The ONLY thing we had that we didn't love was the "Mission Chinese" Kung Pao Pastrami. It just didn't do it for us, and everything else was SO out of this world, that it paled in comparison.   Go, go, go to The Clever Koi!

I love having Grabba Green as a snack and lunch option. Last week I really wanted a GOOD smoothie, and Grabba Green was perfect. I enjoyed the "Feeling Fabulous," which is spinach, kale, avocado, cucumber, coconut, lemon, coconut water and honey. Hearty, creamy with a touch of sweetness.   Previously, I've had the Indochin, which has Rice Noodles, Chicken, Cucumber, Bean Sprouts, Carrots, Green Onion, Cilantro, and a spicy almond sauce.

Mexican-Asian Fusion? It should not be good, right? I mean, I avoided this place for months, despite the beckoning pink sign on Scottsdale Road, because Asian food is awesome and Mexican food is awesome, but I could not imagine them being awesome together. Wow, I was wrong!   My favorite thing to get at Sumo Maya is the Pomegranate Guacamole and the Maya Roll.   The Maya Roll has tuna, crispy rice, masago, micro shiso and wasabi aioli, and it's delicious. I love how the crispy rice on the outside gives the roll a nice crunch without being deep-fried, and the wasabi aioli is very, very yummy.
