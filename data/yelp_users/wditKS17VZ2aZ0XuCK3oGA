Papago is much better than many other golf courses in town.  We have plenty of them to choose from, so it is quite an undertaking to offer what they do at Papago.  My clubs were actually carried from where I parked my truck today.  They really do whatever it takes to please their guests.  It's the little extra things that are impessive.  The greens were almost immaculate and I can't tell you how much of a pleasure they were to putt on.  It's shocking how great this course played in the middle of the sumner.  Everyone who works at Papago obviously loves what they do.  Guys like Brett.  You can tell how much pride they have working here.  Daryl in the clubhouse took really good care of us and almost made us feel like we were members at Bushwood. Can't wait to be back!

I caught myself near death today (being a bit dramatic), but I was saved by an angel.  We are all too familiar with what this heat can do to the unprepared.  Sadie came to my rescue with her hydration techniques, a cold towell, and did all of this with a smile on her face. Thanks Paps!

I stopped in for a late night drink right before they closed on a Tuesday night. It was a fair price for the High West Whiskey, but what really made my night was how Tabby and Kat made me feel welcome even though they were closing. They had plenty of time to spend with me and ask about my night. I'm a bar manager at a nice place right down the street, so I can really appreciate their late night service and the time they speny with me. Thanks!!!

The course was in miserable shape and I'm not exaggerating because I'm upset with some of the circumstances regarding our day at Orange Tree today.  I do not know why we come back here.  They open late, just to jam pack a bunch of golfers on both the 1st tee and the 10th.  We went off as a twosome to start on the 10th.  The two other golfers that were supposed to be playing with us were late so we went off as 2.  We played the front nine in an hour and a half, but ran into a bottleneck of foursomes that were playing multiple balls of the 1st tee box.  They made us wait 30 minutes before they allowed us to start the second half of our day.. what a joke! Now we get to wait on everyone just to play a course in piss poor shape. I'd say half the greens are even considered "greens".  They are more Frankensteined freakish messes half grass half mud than I've ever seen before in my life.  I'm not even sure how they can charge regular rates or at least not try to warn their guests before they invest their time and money... BTW.. I got my clubs stolen here last year, just so the club can instantly point out that they are not liable and honestly didn't even really give a shit to be honest... I thought I'd never come back here, but I let a friend talk me into giving Orange Tree another chance.. never again .. we got tired of waiting 10 minutes on every tee box and decided to call it a day after 12 holes.. This place is a joke and poorly managed.

I was lucky enough to make the right decision when choosing the best clubs to buy. I've always heard great things about Ping products, but now I've had the opportunity to experience the amazing customer service when getting custom fit for my new G25 irons that I purchased earlier this week.  From the moment that I walked in the door I felt welcome. I was custom fit by Nick. Nick told me a lot of things about my swing that I was not aware of and even gave me an education on how and why my clubs should be adjusted ever so slightly. I even left with a sweet ball marker after filling out a quick survey. All of this was free of charge!!! Go by a new set of Pings and make sure to bring them here to get custom fitted. Your future caddy will thank you. Great experience. .. I can't wait to pick them up (only takes a few hours) and get them on the grass where they belong.
