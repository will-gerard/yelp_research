The service here, is sooo bad! We were meeting family, happened to be running behind them and when we got there they were eating already, it took the waiter 20 min just to come take our drink order, another 10 min to come with the drinks and take our order...thought we were good,WRONG! After 45 min. I asked about or food& by the time they came out, approx 5-8 min later, family started leaving, and we just began eating! I will never go there again! They were packed so I could understand a little delay, but come on! 45 min to receive a few of the simplest plates on the menu, um no.

I absolutely LOVE this shop! A lot of the Regal salons in Wal Mart really suck!! This one is Amazing! I usually have LeeLee do my hands and feet, but either of the 2 ladies are good. ( I'm very picky) their prices are good and their promptness is exceptional.( you can only do nails so fast before they start lookin crappy) they try to speak English most of the time, like they don't look at you then start talkin in their language! They make  sure "you like" if not "they fix for you", they are very sanitary, & professional. All in all, I love them, I only have to visit once every 3-4 weeks (thats how good their products Are) & if you're in the area, stop by, they won't keep you waiting & you won't leave with empty pockets or a sad face. Keep up the good work Regal Nails!

It was great! Great customer service! I definitely recommend anyone looking for good pizza & wings, to stop by Barro's! We were greeted immediately once arriving, & were asked to have our order takin. She even gave us an extra cup! Our food was served promptly and it was delicious!
