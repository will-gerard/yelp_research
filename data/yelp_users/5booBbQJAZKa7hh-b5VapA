I wanted to try a gym that had more locations for when I'm in town, and visiting family and friends in other states. I was able to get a 3 day pass online so I thought I'd try this 24 hour fitness location. I used to be a 24 hour fitness member back in California a few years ago. My expectations were relatively high as the other locations were fairly decent.  I'm not sure if all 24 hour fitness' are franchised or of they're corporate, but this location is definitely not up to snuff with other local gyms. The paint scheme feels so 90's and it's as dark as a dungeon. The equipment, while not bad is old. Very old in some cases. They don't have hand /machine sanitizer wipes except some bottle and paper towels. Yuck. Showers are tiny. No WiFi so if your one of those people who stream while they're working out, prepare for your data usage to spike.   With so many competitive gym franchises out there, it isn't easy to recommend this location. Some 24 hour fitness' are nicer, this isn't one of them. There's many locations so that's convenient, but they're not that well kept up, or updated. Skip this location and try other gym franchises first.

Lots of people make long reviews for some fast food joint,  im going to make mine short. My friend wanted to go here, so I thought I'd give it a try since I love cheeses teams. I've had the real thing in Philly, but you could never hold a candle to the best. Honestly, I don't know what the hype is all about. It's not that great to me. They use Kraft cheese whiz, which I could have bought at the grocery store. Meat didn't have much flavor. I felt like I got railed on the price, $30 for two sandwich combos, Cmon. Easy to miss unless you know where it is. Forgettable experience and was more upset when I left then what I came in due to the high expectations of other yelp reviews.

Baci is another whole in the wall restaurant that's hidden, and deserves all the recognition that it can get. The owner (Whose actually Italian, Frank) greets everyone and makes you feel right at home. I went with 2 of my other friends, so I got to try a little of everything. The bread that comes with the meal is very good, but the garlic cheese bread that's $3.99 is very good as well. Everything is homemade, including all of the sauces. I had the Lasagna, while my friends had other pasta dishes. We were all very pleased, and full. The portions are huge! I would definitely recommend Baci as your breakaway from the chains, and for something a little more intimate.

I don't have enough words nor praise  to say about the Discount Tire at this Gilbert location. I was looking for a very specific tire size that nobody in the Valley had. I shopped numerous outlets and found no results. I tried a Big O Tires location because the was closer, but they were priced more than $100 higher. They tried to come up with an excuse which made it worse, as I caught them in their own lie. I too my deposit back. Enough was enough.  I knew any location that was going to earn my business was going to have to work for it. This discount tires found my set in Colorado and immediately had them shipped down to the valley. Their follow up was prompt and polite. They even matched prices with wholesale stores such as Costco and Sams Club. Needless to say, I was more than pleased. Incredibly polite and professional staff. Works harder than any other tire chain. This location has just earned my future business!

I found these guys on a coupon that they were advertising. They had a special for around $28 or so for a car wash and an oil change. I needed both, so decided to check them out. Staff is nice, and went to work right away. I didn't wait too long because I went near closing time. Oil change was done in 10-15 minutes at the max, and kept my car clean. No oil drips underneath the hood, and vehicle paint was protected while they were working on it. Put in the right oil without asking me. The car was was good as well. Very thorough wash. They took off my antenna, and did a great job vacuuming. The only small gripe was that the cashier didn't know how to input my coupon, so it took a few minutes. Beyond that, I'm definitely a fan, and will be going back without a problem!

II went in for a new battery for you iPhone 4s, and was more than pleased. While other people within the valley wanted $45-$50, they were able to get it fixed within a matter of minutes, and at the cost of $29! They also charged up the phone a bit to make sure the battery was good and test called me. These guys are fast, and reasonable! Their office is comfortable as well. I'm quick to recommend anyone coming here for smartphone repairs. I think I've found my new "Go to" phone repair center!

It seems to me that there isn't many hole in the wall restaurants in Phoenix in general, but I'm glad I found my new little hidden gem. This is my first time, and I was more than pleased. I got the chicken thighs and the 7 cheese baked Mac and cheese. Let me start by saying that this place is off the hook. The food is great. I sampled the BBQ, and it's outstanding. They get their wood from Northern Arizona to smoke the meet. And best of all, the people make you feel like you're at home. They're so welcoming and nice. This is far from my last time here.

It was about time that I went to the dentist after skipping out for a few years. Similar to many people, I had absolutely no idea where to turn when it came to finding a dentist that was trustworthy, or even good at dental work. I turned to Yelp to find reviews and stumbled upon Affinity Dental. After reading the solid reviews, I chose to go in.  I was immediately impressed by the staff who cared about you as a person, not just what they can do to your mouth. The reception area was wonderful and relaxing. Even gave me some pointers for future designs in my own home. Everyone there cares to remember your name.  Dr. Wettstein was friendly, easy going, and someone who goes out of their way to build a rapport with their client base. I've since been a few times, and honestly look forward to going to the dentist! Going to the dentist is never a walk in the park, but this place is the closest thing you're going to get to that.
