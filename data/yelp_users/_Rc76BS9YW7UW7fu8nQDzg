Burland is wonderful and very helpful. When my husband and I were ready to get engaged I had a dilemma! My mother gave me her wedding set, which is beautiful, but it was yellow gold and too small for my ring finger. I was debating between having the rings dipped in white gold or resetting the diamonds. I looked up local jewelers on Yelp and came across Burland, which had the best reviews. We went in and Marc helped us, he suggested that dipping the rings would make more sense financially and we did it! They also sized the rings and took off the soldering that my mom had previously done. Everything cost about $160 and the results were amazing! Marc did inform me that after time the white gold would wear off, but I don't mind coming back to have the upkeep done. I definitely suggest coming to Burland for any of your jewelry needs!

I've never been a huge fan of this particular Starbucks location, the coffee is almost always lackluster and the shop just seems messy. On my last visit, which was about 2 weeks ago, a young man maybe around 19 was working as the barista and couldn't seemed to be bothered because he was busy flirting with some young girls that we're hanging out there. I just had a tall cup of coffee which was burnt... Needless to say I won't be going back and instead I'll be going to the Barnes and Noble cafe across the street!

I was first introduced to Crossroads by my mother about a 1 or so ago and had a great Naked smoothie. My boyfriend and I, who aren't religious, love to go and have an iced mocha and a delicious muffin. The baristas are always very nice and helpful if you have any questions and whatever cream they put on the mocha is amazing. If you're looking to try something new and fun try their Caribou, mocha with orange, it's wonderful!

I love Barnes and Noble so much and this location is one of my absolute favorite places to go. Whether I'm browsing for books, getting a coffee, meeting a friend, or just need a quiet place to study this is my one place to go. The café is wonderful and this location has such a wonderful vibe!

This place is a favorite among my friends and I especially because of the wonderful location. My favorite drink is their bottled Mexican Coke, I get it wherever I can! My favorite pizza there is there Margherita pizza, simply beautiful and delicious. Their ingredients are fresh and their crust is to die for. I only wish they were open later!

This place is a definite hole in the wall but worth the find. My signature drink is a hazelnut latte and let me tell you, there's is the best I've ever had. The coffee shop itself is quite small but it's very cute and there is some interesting artwork to view. Not only do they have a wonderful selection of coffee but pastries too. My mom and I shared a Bailey's cupcake and it was decadent to say the least. Definitely check this place out!

I've been a Dutch Bros customer for about 4 years now and for the most part I've been satisfied with them but recently I've gotten quite a headache while stopping for my iced kicker. I love their coffee but the way the employees interact with me is just AWFUL. The "HEY BRO" and "Hey girlie whatcha drinkin' tonight?!?" is annoying and ridiculous. The fake douchy attitude is too much; I mean seriously, I have a migraine and I need some caffeine, can you just shut up and take my order? Calm it down, please.

I love Treehouse Bakery! It happens to be about a 20 second walk from my house so I love to pop in and bring some delicious treats home. My favorite cupcakes are their champagne and macaroon cupcakes, but the classic vanilla and chocolate are always a great choice too. My boyfriend loves their homemade poptarts as well. If you're looking for a refreshment then try one of their iced teas. They have a selection of 3 herbal teas, locally sourced I believe. I forgot what the tea I got was called but it was minty and delicious!

Crescent is definitely one of my favorite venues for shows but their lounge is great as well. They have small but comparable drink menu, I love the Four Peaks Peach Ale. As for appetizers I also go with their chips and salsa, a favorite snack of mine. It comes with fresh thick and crispy tortilla chips and two types of salsa. One is a salsa verde that is very fresh and delicious and the second is a red salsa that is spicy,  garlicky, and delicious! In the past I ordered their chicken tacos for dinner which were very good, last time I ordered their Sinaloa Seafood Chowder and I was wonderful! It came with perfectly cooked chunks of fish, shrimp, tomatoes and other yummy vegetables. My boyfriend always orders their bean and cheese burrito which he always loves. If you're going for a show definitely come early to catch a yummy bite to eat!

I love Oldtown Glendale and I love Coyote Oaties! The woman who runs this business is super sweet and is great at what she does. Their cookies are absolutely to die for but my personal favorite thing to get is their Lemon Soufflé tea! This is a great place to relax and enjoy a local treat!

I was informed of this place (also called The Hop Stop) when I was given a menu while I was attending Glendale Glitters. I was initially very interested in eating there because they had clam chowder in a bread bowl, my ultimate favorite food. About a month or so later my boyfriend and I decided to go for a bite here since we live right down the street. It was bad from the start... When the waitress was taking our drink orders I asked for a Dr. Pepper which she didn't even know if they had and had to check in the back (which they didn't). Then comes the food order and of course I asked for the clam chowder which they didn't have either... So I decided to go with the strawberry salad instead and guess what? No strawberries. So I half-heartedly ordered the tortilla soup in the bread bowl and my boyfriend ordered the BBQ burger without onions. The soup was okay... It could've used salt which wasn't available at the table and our waitress was nowhere to be found, and my boyfriends burger came with a ton of onions.... It's a cute place but we were definitely disappointed and won't be coming back.

Salon D'Shayn is wonderful! I've been getting my gel manicures with Leticia for about 6 weeks now and she's the best. Their prices are very affordable and she always does a fantastic job! I will definitely continue to get my beautiful manicures done at Salon D'Shayn!

My boyfriend and I wanted a drink and some sushi and decided to check out Pallets because it's very close to our home. Being on Roosevelt Row we had high expectations for this restaurant but those hopes were dashed. Right away we were quite unimpressed with their paper menus that were stained presumably with food and drinks. At the time we went it was happy hour and the happy hour menu was nothing special, especially when they claim to have the "best sushi menu in town." As we checked out the happy hour drinks my boyfriend was pleased to see PBR's for a $1.50 and I was interested in getting there specially cocktail Orange Crush (Crabbies Ginger Beer, lime, and vodka I believe) but as it so happened they were out of both drinks. I mean if this is your so-called "specialty" drink you'd like you'd stock up enough ingredients to make it, but I guess not. We opted to get a Screwdriver and a vodka and Sierra Mist for $5 each, only to have the Sierra Mist taste very flat. Next we order some sushi, a spicy tuna roll for $5 on happy hour and a yellow tail himachi roll. The yellow tail roll tasted good but the spicy tuna roll was totally overpowered by whatever spices they used. Needless to say Pallets was not what I expected. Next time I have a sushi craving I'll be going somewhere else!

This place is wonderful! The decorations are authentic and neat and the food is delicious. They have a HUGE selection of salsas, I enjoyed their guacamole and peanut salsa. My boyfriend and I ordered yummy Mexican Coke in the bottle, our favorite. I ordered two of their carne asada tacos with pickled onions and chimichurri sauce which came with rice and beans with fresh cheese on top, it was fantastic. My boyfriend got the bullet burro which he absolutely loved. We'll definitely be coming back to try more of their salsas!

I've driven by this place a number of times and finally stopped in to try it and it was delicious! I ordered the shrimp burrito and a Mexican coke for about $11. The burrito was great; shrimp was cooked perfectly, not overdone, very fresh guacamole and cabbage. I was with my boyfriend and a friend and they gave us a bowl of salsa with our order but no chips... Very weird but we decided to order some chips to actually enjoy the salsa which cost another $3. Marketing tactic? Maybe, and if so, it's working. The salsa was fresh, not too spicy, and really tasty. I'll definitely be coming back!

I love this place, the set up is great and the drinks are delicious. I stop in probably about once a week because it's the close to me and is just a lot of fun. Recently I've noticed that the music has gotten extremely loud in the bar and it's kind of off putting. I loved this place when it first opened but now it's like a screaming match every time I come in. Still a great spot!
