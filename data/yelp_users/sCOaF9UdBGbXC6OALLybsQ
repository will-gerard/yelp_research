I LOVE THE MELTING POT. I honestly don't get what other people are talking about when they say they leave this place hungry...  or that they have bad service... or that they think the food is gross... are we talking about the same restaurant here? When people complain about how it takes 2-3 hours to eat... do they realize that fondue is not standard dining? I'm genuinely confused. Every experience (about 10-15) I've had at this Melting Pot has been great. If you're looking for a romantic, slow, tranquil night out with delicious food - you will not be disappointed here.  There are so many things I enjoy about the Melting Pot, and this location in particular. It's the perfect place for a romantic date or celebration, and you can request one of the more private booths with curtains when you make your reservation - they are so intimate and cozy! I also love that they have happy hour and random deals throughout the year; in May, my boyfriend and I took advantage of the "endless entree" special and I can honestly say I've never eaten more filet mignon than I did that night! Also, I'm not sure if most people think to come here for "just" an appetizer or "just" dessert - but it is very affordable if you do (especially during happy hour). Like 99% of people, my favorite course is definitely the chocolate fondue. You simply can't go wrong with melted chocolate, fruits, cheesecake, pound cake, and rice krispy treats. You just can't.  The service at this location has always been top-notch. I always feel as if I'm royalty when dining here! I love it. It is truly a unique experience that you won't get at a standard restaurant. I have never felt put off by the hostesses or servers and every time I've dined here, the manager has come up to my table to make sure everything is okay.   If you decide to dine here, I highly suggest making a reservation as they fill up quickly on weekends and holidays. Also, check out the specials they have (which are on their website) to make sure you're getting the most cost-efficient option.

This Wildflower location is hit or miss. The food is really inconsistent; one day the butternut squash ravioli will come with sauce that's like a soup, other days it won't come with sauce at all. The manager told us it was impossible to make extra sauce because each batch is made to order...? I know that is a flat-out lie. Whatever. This is the only Wildflower in the area for me and I still really enjoy coming here.  Update: I'm editing this review and adding a star because 1. I really do love Wildflower, despite the customer service issues this location has and 2. the CEO personally contacted me, which I saw as an endearing and positive representation of the brand. I feel that if a CEO or member of management takes the time to accept criticisms, then positive changes will follow.

The only reason I go to Francis & Sons as frequently as I do (about 2x a year, when I'm feeling lazy) is because of how close it is to my house.   The guys who greet you are HORRIBLY obnoxious and pushy. They will try to tell you that you need a new windshield... headlights... a waxing... ugh!  No, no, no. I'm a poor college student using a free car wash coupon, just wash the damn car! I've found that the worst part of the cleaning is done when the people vacuum your car...or in my experience, half of the car. They've consistently ignored my entire trunk (which is the part that I need cleaned the most) which is super annoying. The staff who actually do the hand drying and polishing work their asses off. They always do a solid job, and I feel bad that they have to work in the heat all day. Ugh. Whenever I leave, my car looks nice on the outside, but there is always something that gets missed in the interior which leaves a sour taste in my mouth (and a regret for giving a $3 tip on a basic wash).  If I have free washes I'll come back, but after my past few experiences I'm not giving the company another dime.

I went to Four Peaks on Wednesday night around 11 PM with my boyfriend. After we we were seated, it took 20 minutes for a server to come to our table. It wasn't busy, but it seemed like they had one girl working the entire patio. We ordered beers and our food, which came out about 20 minutes after that. Our server was checking in on every other table except for ours. When it came time for the check, we had to wait for an additional 15 minutes while she literally spent 15 minutes talking to customers at another table. Very unprofessional. She was nice enough but just I couldn't tell if service was bad because she was busy or lazy.   The food was fine, though. We shared the spinach artichoke dip and my boyfriend got a burger. I got the peach ale which is one of my favorite beers.  Despite this being the "original" location, I prefer the one in North Scottsdale and probably won't be back here.

Thursday was my first time at Casey Moore's, and I really, really liked it! Kiltlifter is on special on Thursdays, so I was happy from the get-go. The location is really cute, I love the outdoor patio and the inside feels like an authentic pub. Everyone there either had tattoos, piercings, or both - as mentioned in the other reviews, this place is a magnet for hipsters for sure.   My friends and I sat out on the patio and got beers and food. I ordered the Turkey Croissant sandwich with cole slaw, and it was excellent. My friend ordered the Chipotle Hummus and it was also very good! The pita was a little burnt, but it was still fine to eat.   Our service was attentive and friendly, and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. I'm glad I finally made the trip to Casey Moore's and I hope to be back soon!

I've been hearing great things about the Village Roastery for years and decided to finally come in today!  Love the atmosphere, music, and ambiance. It's all very homey and comfortable. I didn't know exactly what I wanted, and the barista was kind enough to work with my mom and me in making out decision. We got 2 small lattes and opted for mugs instead of cups. Because the mugs were smaller, they only charged us for Americanos, which are over $1 cheaper. Customer service for the win!  Our lattes were INCREDIBLE! The espresso was perfectly bold, but not bitter. Definitely one of the best lattes I've ever had.   I'll definitely be back!

Conquering Camelback has been on my bucket list since I found out what a bucket list was. I have an extreme fear of heights and have always had to stop at the part with the rails because I got too scared. This time was different. I was going to beat Camelback, panic attacks and all!  I started with a friend who has done Echo ~10 times before (thank god, because he brought a Camelbak). Going up, I didn't realize how much I would be using my hands. I kept thinking how this was more of a rock climbing experience than a hike.   When it came to the first set of rails, I thought I was cool enough to not need them. Wrong. As soon as I realized I had nowhere for my feet to go, I turned around and saw the steep drop and almost pooped my pants. Seriously. A fellow hiker was nice enough to encourage me and I managed to get across to the rails. (Warning: do not proceed up the slippery rock to the right of the rails. Just don't.)  The steep incline didn't really get to me until after the second set of rails. As I looked up, I knew how high I was and started freaking out again. I had to mentally get myself out of the panic attacks I was having by looking at the children (literally, 7 year olds) and older folk (literally, 65 year olds) that were doing this with ease.   Alas, with many breaks along the way, I made it to the top. But that was only half the fun, because I had the entire way down to look forward to!  Surprisingly, going down was like, 150% easier than going up. It was hotter and more crowded (we started at 7 AM) so the number of people was annoying. However, I made it down without any falls or injuries. Yay. When I got off the mountain, I can honestly say I have never felt so accomplished with a physical task. It was WELL worth the blood, sweat, and almost tears!  (Also, this provided an awesome full body workout. My polar HR *said* I burned 1000 calories in the 1:45:00 it took to do the entire hike.)  Tips (from my experience): -Wear gloves. You will need them. -Bring water and lots of it. Because you will be using your hands for ~50% of this hike, I suggest a hands-free system (such as a Camelback). -Start early, before it is crowded + hot. -Enjoy the summit. You EARNED it. -if I can make it to the top, so can you.   Happy hiking!

I love Changing Hands (and First Draft!). They have a fantastic selection of new and used books and fun and quirky items. The employees are always friendly, the store is always quiet and clean. Plus... it's adjacent to a Wildflower and about 200 feet away from a Trader Joe's.   My only gripe is that there isn't much seating in the bookstore... First Draft has them beat in that department.

LUSH is pretty much the only reason why I ever go to Fashion Square these days. I am a slave to Charity Pot, Dark Angels, Stepping Stone, and their massage bars!  The staff at this location is always super friendly and knowledgeable, and you don't get that sales-y vibe from the employees (like where you feel forced to buy things). Aside from being an avid fan of LUSH's products, company policies, and activism, I really like the way you can sample pretty much any product that's in the store (including bath bombs; the employees will show you how they "work" in a bowl!). Also, depending on when you go/who is working, chances are high that you can get either a free facial using LUSH's facial cleansers and masks or a foot soak/scrub. It never hurts to ask, even if an employee doesn't offer these services up.

My boyfriend and I decided to try a new pizza joint tonight, and we picked Spinato's based on the raving reviews. We ordered the small cheese pizza (thin crust), gluten free garlic bread, and the Italian beef sandwich for take-out.  The bill came to about $30. When we got home, we opened the box with the $5 garlic bread... It was literally half of a hot dog bun! The sandwich was also incredibly small. While flavorful, it wasn't worth $8.99. The pizza was mediocre at best, soggy crust and the sauce was too sweet for my taste.  Overall, the food was less than average but for a higher than average price. I'll stick with Ray's and Redendo's from now on for my pizza. I added a star because of the girl who took our order, who was pleasant and polite and provided good customer service.

I've been coming here for 10 years, and the staff never fails to be TERRIBLE and apathetic. Today I waited in line for 15 MINUTES while the cashier and her friend (another Ross employee buying clothes, must've been off shift) chatted away and took their sweet time ringing up her items. I literally had 2 items and was the only person in line, so I just stood there awkwardly listening to their loud and unprofessional conversation. I've always had bad customer service here, but today took the cake.  I will still come here, though, because the prices are unbeatable and it's a lot more convenient than driving to the Ross of FLW & the 101.

Yum! I got the taro smoothie with extra bubbles - it was perfect! My friend got the coconut milk tea w/ regular boba. Hers was kind of watery, but mine was great.  The atmosphere in there was weird; the employee wasn't very friendly. Maybe it was because we were literally the only ones in there. I don't really like the starkness in there, despite all of the drawings on the walls.   The drinks were good and decently priced. I'll be back!

I am in love with Sprinkles' red velvet cupcakes! They are perfectly moist and the cream cheese frosting is delicious. Every time I've been in this location, the staff has been friendly and luckily the store hasn't been crowded.

Not really sure where the whole "New York" Chinese thing comes from, because Red Dragon had the most mediocre, flavorless Chinese I've ever eaten.  Their lo mein was greasy, and the chicken and broccoli and cashew chicken had NO flavor. The wonton soup wasn't bad, but the wontons were mushy and overcooked.   The prices are really cheap compared to other Chinese places in the area, which seems to be indicative of the quality of their food. Jade Palace, albeit more expensive than Red Dragon, is a mile away and 150% better.  I don't think I'll be back.

Hands down the BEST place for happy hour food. Ever.  I'm actually glad I never thought about happy hour for food at Ling & Louie's during the three years I worked next door. I would have spent so much money and consumed so many extra calories on the delicious food!  My favorite items are the Asian nachos, crab tempura roll, chicken satay, and the calimari. YUM. I always spend less than $20 here for 2 people to eat, and leave stuffed with leftovers in hand.  Service has always been quick, friendly, and consistent.   4/5 stars!

My boyfriend & I moved from Tempe to Scottsdale and definitely weren't excited about moving couches and beds up three flights of stairs, so we decided to look into hiring movers. After reading up on moving companies on Yelp, we couldn't have made a better decision with Camelback Moving! They have competitive rates and were able to fit our schedule perfectly. We had Chris & Toby, and they worked their butts off. It was great that they brought wardrobe boxes at no charge, and they were so helpful and actually took our concerns into consideration. Our total moving time was a little over three hours, and Chris & Toby made our move so easy and stress-free. I would 100% recommend Camelback Moving to anyone who is looking to relocate, near or far.

$11 for half a boring sandwich and a flavorless salad?! Paradise doesn't hold a candle compared to Wildflower.  The service was fine, but the food was SO average that I can't justify spending that much for what I got again.

I went to Say Sushi while visiting a friend in Maricopa yesterday. They have an all-day happy hour on Sundays, so we got a ton of food: the las vegas roll, two tootsie rolls, monkey balls, and the tempura mix. Our food was great! I really, really enjoyed everything that we ordered.   The prices were great because it was happy hour, and we had enough food to bring home for a snack later. Service was pretty standard. Location was in a strip mall, next to a Sally's. I'd definitely go back to Say Sushi.

I really like this Starbucks! It seems almost like a local coffee shop; it's cozy, they have a really small staff, and (at least when I go) it's usually not busy.  The service is always really friendly. I've seen some of the staff working at other Starbucks locations in Flagstaff, probably due to shift swaps and such. I come here to sit and do homework because it's pretty quiet and they have a ton of outlets!   The only disadvantages of this location are the hours (they close at 7 PM) and the temperature. Even in the summer, I have to bring a sweater if I plan on spending time in there. I understand the machines make it really hot for the workers, but the AC is so powerful in there that it's almost uncomfortable. Maybe it's their way of getting people to leave? Not sure.   Anyways, I like this location a lot. Definitely one of the best Starbucks I've gone to (which is... a lot).

After looking at previous reviews of Al Omda Hookah, I decided to check it out with my boyfriend on Thursday night. Something I absolutely hate about hookah places is that the employees can be very snobby and condescending if you aren't a hookah master (which I definitely am not), and as soon as we walked into Al Omda we were greeted by the owner, Moe. He was very friendly, hospitable, and asked us if we were first time customers... he made us feel right at home, which was great! We said yes and he handed us a menu, and we placed our order. We got a one hose, ASU Lovers mix which lasted us for 1.5 hours easy. Moe came over and checked on us to change our coals out and also brought us equipment to blow bubbles, which was very fun. Al Omda is decorated really well, the music (a mix of hits and ethnic music) definitely adds to the ambiance, and it is extremely cozy... perfect for a chill hangout spot for those who aren't really into the loud music and pretentiousness of most hookah joints. We had a great time for less than $20, and will definitely be back!

I remember a few years ago when Zoës Kitchen was the first restaurant I had been to that had the futuristic, touch screen soda machine!  I really, really love Zoës Kitchen. You wouldn't think from the name or decor that the food was Mediterranean, but it is and they do it well. There are just a lot of little things that make the atmosphere great, such as the children's artwork on the walls. The staff at this location is very friendly, service is quick, and the food is always tasty. I could swear that they put crack in their marinated slaw...

I'm angry giving this place ONE star.  Yesterday morning, my boyfriend and I wanted to try a new place for Sunday brunch. We called at 10:55 and were told there was no wait, so we drove to The Egg I Am.   We arrived and were told there 4 parties ahead of us waiting to be seated (wtf?) which is fine given it was a Sunday morning - but why lie about that on the phone? Okay, whatever.  We were seated after about 15 minutes at a booth right behind the host stand. I felt like I was on a cruise ship, because the guy sitting behind me was fidgeting and it shook our entire table. I figured I wouldn't say anything about it since I would be focused on eating my food in just a few minutes.  Our server came by; she was friendly and took our order. I got the daily special - a "BTO" croissant. While we were waiting for our food, the couple sitting behind us left and two workers came by to clean up their table. They proceeded to bitch about how messy people left tables and how customers would leave their own kitchens in the manner in which they left restaurant tables. Okay, it is COMMON SENSE to not bitch about your job/customers around other patrons! Like, I understood their frustrations, but seriously..m professionalism please?  So we get our food. My sandwich was SOGGY, meaning the croissant was previously frozen and microwaved. Ugh. The food was completely lackluster, unmemorable, and average at best. Little egg/meat, tons of greast, canola oiled potatoes. We get our check and are ready to leave when I notice I was overcharged for my meal.  The special was listed as $8.79. I was charged $9.99 plus $0.99 for substituting egg whites. Nowhere did it say egg whites were extra, but whatever. So I go up to this counter and explain to the apathetic 16 year old hostess that I was overcharged. She called over her manager, who looked at my bill, rolled her eyes, and mumbled to the girl "This is a $0.20 difference" as if to imply that I was some cheap idiot wasting her time. I pointed out that actually I had been overcharged $2.20, NOT $0.20. She rolled her eyes, fixed my tab, and walked away.  Seriously lady? Even if it WAS only $0.20, then YOU can pull the change out of YOUR pocket to pay my tab. I was appalled at the rudeness of the staff at this "establishment." I can honestly say it was the first meal/restaurant to leave a sour taste in my mouth.  Whoever owns this place needs to clean house and hire competent staff. In an economy like ours, I seriously wonder how these people have jobs.

I've previously had Nami's products, but yesterday was my first visit visit to their location. I love the variety of their products (baked goods, gluten-free options, etc.) and love that everything is vegan! My boyfriend and I shared the PB & Choco Tsoynami which was amazing. It's a bummer that I live so far from downtown or else I'd be here weekly. :)

This was my first visit to this Green location - I love the Tempe location but decided to try something different yesterday.  Green is located next to Nami in what looks like a tiny vegan complex. I love how cute and cozy Green was! The ice cube machine made me laugh too. Service was friendly, food was good as always. I was happy that they had the same menu as the Tempe location so I was able to get my usual - the calexico burger with thyme fries and buffalo "wings." Yum!   I'll be back to try their brunch!

I went to Grassroots Kitchen & Tap for dinner with a friend this week because we wanted to try something a little different, and after looking at the menu, I decided to give this place a try.  It's located next to one of my favorite coffee shops (The Village Roastery), and has a beautiful heated patio which is where we sat. The restaurant itself if very nice; it has a great ambiance to it.   I ordered a Kona beer, the shrimp poboy, and jalapeno & cheese grits. Hooooly crap, I kid you not, I think I could die in a vat of those grits. They were heavenly! You wouldn't expect a Grassroots to have such a southern/creole vibe to it, but it totally works.   Our waitress was very sweet, service was prompt and friendly. The only drawback is that the prices are a little high, but you do get large portions. It would be really fun to come for their social hour with a group of friends.

I have a friend who comes here almost every day, and her pictures and posts of Zookz made me HAVE to make the trip to Phoenix to eat there. The location is really cute and I loved the decor. Service incredibly friendly and attentive. They asked how I heard of them and I told them how I heard through my friend (they immediately knew who I was talking about). I really enjoyed the feel in Zookz. You can tell it is a small, locally-owned business that treats their employees right.  The food: I got #20 with the potato salad (and a soda, because their cups were cute. I'm weird). My friend got #25 with the kale salad. I'm forgetting what exactly was in mine... I think turkey, avocado, cheese, and tomatoes... but it was delicious! I was really impressed with the bread, which was crispy and light but with great flavor. My sandwich + soda was ~$9. Pretty good price for a locally owned small business.  I highly recommend Zookz to anyone who is in Phoenix (or even by making a trip out there for those of us who live in N. Scottsdale). I've already told all of my friends about Zookz, and I can't wait until I can go back!

$15 to get in, and $2 each for tacos smaller than the palm of my hand? I don't think so.  I went to the festival on Saturday and was appalled at the lines for everything - especially for the "tokens" which you HAVE to get in order to buy anything! (1 token = $2). The tacos I had were nothing special. I left hungry after spending $25 total.  This event is THE biggest ripoff ever.

This Fry's gas station consistently has the cheapest gas in the 85259/58/60 area - oftentimes even cheaper than Costco and Sam's Club.   The biggest drawback about this gas station is the HORRIBLE layout! The entrance is funky; you never know where you're supposed to go, people are cutting in front of you in line (because it's always busy), and getting out always makes me feel like I'm going to get T-boned.   Alas, I still come here for gas because saving $0.20/gallon is WORTH IT!

I've been going to this nail salon on and off for the last 4 years, and it's my favorite in the area! I feel like Super 7 Nails is a hidden gem amongst hundreds of nail salons in the area.  Service has always been great, the techs all speak English, and prices are pretty standard (unless you find a coupon). I just had a gel manicure done today which was $30 and my tech (I didn't catch her name, she was very young and so sweet) did a PERFECT job!  Highly recommend this salon. It's so much better than Ancala Nails and Lynn's!

I came into Altitude with high hopes, but unfotunately my experience was average at best and WAY overpriced.  Despite there only being a few people inside, the space was very cramped and I sat at the only open table - which looked like it hadn't been wiped in hours. I ordered a latte for myself and a bold brew for my mom. My latte was ~okay~. My mom's bold brew coffee was TERRIBLE. It literally tasted like water. I can't imagine what the light roast tastes like... luckily, I won't have to.  The ambiance is really nice and I love the outside patio. I just wish they had more seating availability inside. Also, it was weird that a guy was sitting at the table next to us awkwardly FACING us for over an hour (with no drink or anything whatsoever) and then it turns out he's close with the server/manager? So he was basically hogging a table when seating was cramped as it was. He started massaging the counter girl...awkward? And super unprofessional for the manager to be sitting at a 6 person table on his laptop.  TL;DR: For $7, I got a mediocre latte and my mom got a terrible coffee. Even though Altitude is aesthetically pleasing, the main reason you go to a coffee shop is for... the coffee. With that said, I am hesitant to come back. I prefer the Village Roastery which is right around the corner.

Worst "Mediterranean" food ever. I got a gyro plate (~$9), and the meat could not have been more flavorless or cold! The employees were quiet but nice (I guess), but they literally gave me the smallest portions ever (3 pieces of onion exactly, not even a full scoop of pilaf). I don't understand why this place has 4 stars on here!  I should've just went with my gut and gotten at Panda Express instead of trying something new. :(

I tried to go to Topgolf last Saturday, and walked out when I found out my group would have to wait 3+ hours to get a bay. We returned this morning at 11, and got assigned to bay 204. This was my first time at Topgolf, and I was pleasantly surprised at how relaxed and fun it was! The lobby felt claustrophobic (it's small and it seems like there are about 300 people in there at all times), but our bay and the surrounding areas were not crowded at all. We ordered beer and food, and the food was very mediocre. It tasted like bowling alley/bar food. Nothing special. At least the prices weren't egregious.  As a non-golfer, I thought Topgolf was really fun and a great activity to do with a group of friends. The hourly fee seems steep for a single person or a couple, but splitting it between 6 people made it very affordable! I would recommend eating beforehand or after and just getting drinks while playing, since the food was very "bleh." Overall, I had a very fun time and am excited to go back!

Great place for lunch. Servings are huge, food is good. Fast service. The only reason I took off a star is because the fries were not cooked enough. I'll definitely be back!
