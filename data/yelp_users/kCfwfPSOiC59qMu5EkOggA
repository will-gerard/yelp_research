A damn good, real burger!  Totally worth dropping in... great cheeseburger and the generous portion of fries had to be shared among 4 adults!

Friendly and helpful staff... Extremely convenient location for Old Town and Fifth Street.  Also, a Keurig coffee maker in the room.  A definite bonus for making better "in room" coffee.

The Four Kegs rocked!  Friendly people and the meatball boli was awesome!  The dough was super-fresh, tastey and cooked just right!  A good place to find...  Shiner Bock on tap, another plus!  Watched the Lakers game as we plowed through the Spicy BBQ wings, that hit the spot!

Have been coming to Mesa for a few years simply because the food is amazing and consistently delicious.  I have to branch out, but almost always order the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin.  It is an amazing dish that has just the right balance of spicy heat and smokiness.  The tenderloin has a pleasant hint of heat and avoids frying your taste-buds so you can enjoy the entree.  Another favorite of mine is the Sophie's Chop Salad, which is another great example of balance.  The salad is visually appealing and has perfect proportions of flavors and textures.  The whole experience may be pricey, but is worth it.

What can I say?  The guac is awesome, service is quick and I like the ambiance... plus I always tease my girlfriend that I will buy her a shirt (or something else) from here!

I had an unexplainable need to have bbq, so I headed over to Lucille's to check it out.  First, big points for having cold Shiner Bock on tap - which went perfectly with my slab of St. Louis style ribs.  The best rack of ribs that I had in a while!  Tender, juicy ribs with a hint of carmelization on the outside.  Didn't even need to open a bottle of sauce for dipping!  So much food, I couldn't even finish.  Ordered cheese grits and sweet potato fries as my sides; the fries were seasoned and tasty, didn't need ketchup or ranch for them.  Amiable service - very friendly and attentive, even during a dinner rush!

Whoooo... needs a remodel and some better fresh food options.  Felt like I was trapped in the 1980s.  Oddly, at 3pm, I was the only person not buying massive quantities of alcohol.  Must be a good deal at this Fry's.

If your business takes you to the Henderson area, this is definitely a great place to stay.  Everyone at the hotel was friendly and helpful - really upbeat customer service.  My room was perfect, business friendly and quiet at night.  An added benefit, I had a great view of the Strip (in the distance).

I have to give these guys some stars for being the best burrito I have ever had at an airport.  Nice people, speedy service.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked my chicken and artichoke heart burrito.  It was so hot, I had to wait a while before I inhaled it at my gate.  How often can you say that about airport food?

Whoever came up with adding Sriracha to the PBJ burger is a genius!  The Sriracha added just the right amount of heat to let you know it had come to the party without kicking the door down with a pink wig on and screaming, "I'm here!"  Great stuff, love this place.
