Some of the best BBQ in the valley. Whole hog heaven was awesome and our server sawyer anticipated our needs perfectly.

I think I'll wait a few more weeks to come back. The noodle place was closed at 12 because they sold out. It looked like no one was managing the place. Pasta was just allright. I asked for bread and never got it. I'll try it again but they have a lot of kinks to work out.
