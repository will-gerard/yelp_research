EDC weekend, wanted some Xiao long bao's and we yelped this place. Worse XLBs I have ever heard, meat was bland, wrapping was mooshy and each one popped its soupy goodness before it even got to our plate or in our mouths. Also ordered some other dishes, but they were all terrible except for soy milk. Place smelled sour inside, restaurant was dingy. I can't believe anyone would eat here. Worse experience in a long long time.

i wish I could rate this place with more stars but sad to say I can't. I take all my cars here, have been a lifetime customer since I turned 16. But today when I brought in 1 tire to get replaced, i was not treated the way I normaly am. I have always price matched with tire rack or their discount tire direct website to try to save maybe ten bucks, but ryan would just add on random prices such installation, shipping prices bla bla bla.   After I priced the tire online through their regular discount tire website, total out the door was still 4.xx cheaper than what I paid.   This will be my last time visiting this place and am going to take all my other business to either there competitors....Costco, walmart, or maybe I will try another discount tire.

I was the only one in line, didn't see anyone in the dining area. Super slow drive thru. I think their burritos cost more than the other filiberto that's on Elliot/McQueen. I asked for guacamole in my burrito, didn't get it, but was charged. Burritos are also smaller than the Filibertos that I just mentioned. Saving grace-it taste decent.   I'm sticking to the Elliot and McQueen location. Food taste like it's better quality and faster service.

This review is for their service department only and over a course of about 2 weeks.   Brought  our family 06 S350 for service for transmission leak, and the automatic doors not working. Was emailed by Greg in service that the diagnosis was that a PSE pump is broken ($1,002.26), 13 pin connector is causing transmission to leak ($115.62) and that a reccomended transmission service be performed ($371.86). Keep in mind that the transmission leaked before, but was fixed under warranty. Tried calling to get more explanation, after multiple voicemails left, I was able to finally get a hold of Greg. After some explanation, We gave the go ahead to fix the problems and  A bit north of $1400 and a couple of weeks later, got the car back. Only to find only 3/4 doors working.   This is when I tried calling Greg again, left 2 voicemails on Tuesday and no call backs, 3 days later, I got a hold of him by luck because the person that answered the phone went to grab him instead of transferring me to his line.  We got an estimate of $900 more to get the 4th door working due to a failed latch. So we paid $1,002 for initial problem, only to get it 75% done, that is unacceptable and this is a lot of money we just threw away. If we had known that it was a PSE pump and/or/maybe a bad latch, we probably would of went elsewhere since its so expensive. Now that we wasted all of this money and time into the PHX Motor Company Service Department, we will have to go elsewhere to get that 4th door working.  dont know if they are trying to milk us for more money, or just very bad at diagnosing problems, but I would definitely NOT recommend anyone to come here EVER. (Forgot to mention that the last time speaking with Greg, I was obviously upset and was venting how upset I was, and he hung up on me)   This will be the last time we deal with Phoenix Motor Company. Misdiagnosis, 2 weeks to get our car fixed, Rude and apathetic Service Advisor that will never call you back and expensive service repairs, though it is expected for luxury brands.

Came back here after the GM received my survey from Phoenix Motor Company and Mercedes Benz and got the problem solved without any out of pocket to us. Venting online does help and I can say they can now know we will be back for future sales and service.   Only problem still is the original GM Allen that contacted me no longer works there, our new service advisor Christy Eastridge that took our vehicle in the 2nd time no longer works there and our long time friend / sales guy Roger Day no longer works there. What gives PMC MB?

Best burger I have had in a really long time. They come in two sizes, the largest one was the perfect amount of meat, filling me up without me wanting more. Hawaiian burger used real pineapple, not the canned kind. Swish and mushroom was also very tasty. Good quality beef, cooked to perfection. A nice array of dipping sauces that the waitress brought out without us even asking. Variety is the spice of life
