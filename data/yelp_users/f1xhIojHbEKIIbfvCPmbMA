While shopping around Scottsdale Fashion Square I asked a kind woman helping me where I should go to get some work done. Without hesitation she told me to come here. After, I saw some of my friends had glowing reviews for this spot, I adventured my way over.  Parking was a struggle (but hey, when isn't it for me in a rental car?) but it was well worth it. You know those moments when you walk into a place so cool and eclectic you just have to walk around and find your bearings before you can sit? That's what my wide-eyed happy self did when I walked through the front door.   There are a few patio spots, but I nestled right in a cozy two person table by the front door to hammer out some work. I went to the front to order a drink and felt like I met some new friends. Everyone was kind and so helpful which gave me a lovely home-ee feeling. I went to the wall cooler and grabbed a beer and needless to say, my productivity soared.   I kept smelling intriguing pizza so I had to grab a couple to-go when I left. And... some cupcakes. I got a cheese  and roasted corn with goat cheese pizza and they tasted as good as they smelled. It wasn't a greasy pizza and it had just the right amount of flavor to make each bite beautiful. Been to CPK? The pizzas are about that size. Want to be completely stuffed? Order one for yourself or have a great meal for two. The S'more cupcake was out of this world bursting with goodness. Not too sweet, not too cakey, but jjjuuussssstttt right.

Airport? More like struggle bus.   It's a struggle to go from one terminal to the next.  It's a struggle to keep your nose closed (it's quite stinky.) It's a struggle to find charging outlets. And, quite frankly, it's a struggle to even look at. The bathrooms = struggle. Ya, there are loud slot machines. Ya, there's an Einstein Bagel. Ya, I try to avoid layovers here! Talk to my husband who is currently playing the Wheel of Fortune slot machine later. If he wins some of dat cash money, I might bump to 3 stars.

Under any circumstance, this would be fun! It would be a great family activity, birthday excursion, or even an awkward first date would be enjoyable here.   Kendall and I were on a mission to do something outdoorsy and adventurous before our conference in AZ. When we saw this place conveniently located just under 15 minutes from the airport it was an easy decision with the glowing Yelp reviews. There are several water 'excursions' to choose from all the way from hydro-bking to kayaking. In an hour Kendall and I kayaked, paddleboarded, and HYRDO-BIKED.   There wasn't a wait at all and the staff was as friendly as could be. All of the equipment looked new and was spotless. The river had a great view of some AZ mountains and the ASU campus.   Prices were reasonable - about $25 per hour. You can also leave your belongings with the staff in the office. There isn't a tip jar, but tip anyway - these people know what they're doing!

I ventured here for a good breakfast a couple weeks ago and got WAY more than that.   I came by myself but felt like I walked into a family when seated. The hostess was so kind and welcoming, the food was incredible, and don't even get me started on my waitress who made me want to change the world for better.  I was hungry... like really hungry so I ordered not only an egg white omlete with fruit but a huge apple granola pancake as well. You guys... I was maybe like 7 bites away from finishing it! The omlete was cooked perfectly topped with avocado and the fruit was fresh. And, the pancake - oh my gosh so good. The granola inside the pancake was such a great unique twist.  You have a few options for the kind of brew you want for your coffee and they bring it to you in a huge caraf for refills galore! This made my heart flutter.  As I mentioned, I had the ultimate waitress named Michelle. Want to smile and feel nurtured with love? Ask to sit in her section - trust me! She was the best part of my experience here.

Hands down, the best coffee slash coffee experience I have ever had in an airport.  It felt like a little oasis with prime people watching in a busy terminal with baristas that are kind and care about the process.  Let's talk about the process. I have magnificent friends who are supreme baristas because they love the process. It's quite evident here that the all of the people and products here are dedicated to the process of creating quality. Come here for a drink made with intention and enjoy every sip.  I ordered a cappuccino. It was perfectly made with just the right amount of flavor and foam on top. One of the best parts was I enjoyed it from a real coffee cup - not a to-go one.   This is one of those places where I will intentionally be early for my flight so I can spend time here!

When 6:00AM was deemed the hike time this week I had to think about it for a second... I am so happy I decided it was worth cutting sleep short!  I do recommend the crack of dawn visit here as it is spectacularly breathtakingly beautiful to watch the sunrise and take some sweet pics to Instagram (I recommend LoFi.) There was a group of about 12 of us who participated and I bet I can say the trail made all levels feel accomplished - I sure did.  All of the people we passed (or who passed us) were lovely and happily chirped "good morning!" We only walked up the path for a good 45 minutes-ish before running back down but I heard from someone it's possible to walk up one side and down the other.  Next time I am town this a definite must-do!
