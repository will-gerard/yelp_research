Been in surprise for a long time for a reason. Good prices, family owned, and always friendly. Their wings are my favorite but they also have good pizza and steak sandwiches. I love supporting a family owned business that actually cares about their customers.

Been going to this Pei Wei since it opened. The food is very inconsistent and tonight they said the food would be read in 20 minutes. I arrived 20 minutes later to wait another 25. I think I will try somewhere else from now on.

Good food, and affordable. I use to go to a place like this in California but this is better. I had the double burger and my wife bad the gyro. Both were very good and were generous portions. It's very clean too.

Very good donuts and great service. I am glad to give my money to a small business. I hope they stay around for a long time.
