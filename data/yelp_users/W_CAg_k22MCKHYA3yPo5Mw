I Love this place when I am home in Carefree.  They have a great menu and are very helpful with regards to my food allergies!!  Sometimes I just have a glass of wine (or 2) but have tried many things on the menu.  My current dinner favorite is the Chicken Schnitzel!  Good sized portion and very tasty!  They now have Cider on tap too....Delicious!

The whole dynamics of Venues has changed!  Carefree Station closed and they brought over most of the staff and it is crowded and noisy the original patrons of Venues have left and gone elsewhere. And a new crowd has followed from the other restaurant.  I find it to be a very odd and awkward situation......we'll see?
