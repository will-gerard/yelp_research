I went to this salon on a whim, as I was desperate to get a haircut and color before my scheduled trip. I called on a Friday, and they were able to get me in. I arrived for My appointment on time which was scheduled for 2:15, I didn't get called until 2:40. My stylist Rosie, was nice,  I explained to her what I wanted and we talked about several options on how to get there. Once we agreed on the hair color, I noticed that after she came back from mixing the color, her hands smelled like cigarette smoke. (I can't stand that smell). We talked, and she is very nice. However, I didn't like that she never once checked on me while I was sitting there with the color on my hair, until I started getting a tingling/burn feeling on my scalp.. I asked one of the other stylist if they could call her from the back. My hair looked great but the lightening in the salon isn't that great so I couldn't really see a difference in my shade. Once I got home I noticed that I a had a mess of a hair color. The top part (roots) were alot lighter than the bottom. I called to see if I could reschedule. I got an appointment scheduled for the following day, only for them to call me to tell me she had called in sick. So now I'm off on my scheduled trip looking like a skunk. Unless you are in a hurry or on a serious budget I wouldn't recommend this place.

Got my first cut today at the Root. Emily was fabulous, friendly, and very professional. The appointment started on time, I was offered soda or water and cookies prior to the cut. I loved the inside decor of the salon The place was very clean and smelled great. I like that I didn't feel pushed or compelled to buy any products, but walked away with Diamante Illuminating Volumizer which was used on my hair to add volume. The cut was exactly what I wanted. I knew my hair was in pretty bad shape, and I really liked the fact that Emily was very positive and very constructive on the type of cut I needed.  I am excited to go back in a few months and get my hair colored by Emily.

After two years in Phoenix, I finally got a hair cut and color that I loved!!! I hate paying so much for a cut and color only to come out hating it... My experience was totally different. I loved the trendy unique feel of the salon, it's clean, and friendly and overall everything I wanted. Damien was just Brilliant with my color and haircut. He gave me exactly what I needed and wanted. Wonderful experience. Thank you Snap Dragon.

I've been going to this place for about a year, and I can say I've never been disappointed. The salads selection is great, the drinks are great,  and the best thing of all is that you don't break the bank for some good food. My favorite salad is the Chopped Salad. - They have a good happy hour with a great selection of drinks. The service is good overall, and I would recommend going there.

We stumbled upon this place when we tried to eat at Cibo, but when they were to full to seat us, we decided to try Local Breeze which is right next door. We opted to eat outdoors because the evening weather was so nice. The ambiance outdoors reminds in a way of Bahama Breeze. The place is fairly big, but has never been so busy that you can't get seated right away. The menu has surplus of good dishes including nice salads. I would recommend this place to anyone who would like to have a mid-size party. I haven't tried brunch or lunch, but so far I would recommend this place.

This was my first experience having Vietnamese food in Phoenix.  Maybe my expectations were a little to high. The place is small, run down and dirty. The floors looked like they hadn't been cleaned in months. The service was okay, but the disappointment came with the food. I don't think I can go back. I thought it was way to greasy... I won't be going back Needless, who cares about the price.

What a wonderful December evening to have dinner on Hula's outdoor patio. We got there about six, and were seated immediately outside next to the fire pit. I thought we might get to hot, but it was Great seating. I ordered the Blackbean burger and yam fries. The burger was delicious and so were the fries. I'm not much of a fan for mixed drinks, but I did order a glass of wine that was just perfect with my food. The service was great, and I would go back to this place.

Been driving by this place for some time, and finally I decided to try it. I was skeptical at first because the parking isn't very inviting. The restaurant is somewhat small but yet quaint. I was very excited to try all the salsa's but was utterly disappointed when the chips they brought us were hard, stale, and just not suitable for eating. I think they were some of the worst chips I have ever had, I had one.. I requested another basket and they kindly bought another basket of chips but they were the same, Stale, hard and dull. I ordered the Aztec Tinga Taco, and they were very good. The salsa's were all great. The service was great, and the waitress apologized for the chips, and stated that they had ran out and had to buy some etc, etc.. Overall tacos were great for the money, just disappointed with the chips.

I have been driving by this place every day since it opened, but was never enticed to check it out because it doesn't have much curb appeal. The curiosity got to me, so I tried it. Boy am I so happy that we stopped in. It's like they say don't judge a book by it's cover. That's exactly what fits the description of this place. Outside it doesn't look like much. In fact we thought the place was closed upon getting there. We were seated immediately, the service was timely and so friendly. Gasper the owner stopped by to check in on us at the end of our meal. - We ordered two pizza's the formagio and Regina. Wow, they were exceptional and I would rate them right up there with Cibo and Pizzeria Bianco.   What really appealed to me was the environment, I felt like I was in a little italian villa. It was a great dining experience and highly would recommend it to anyone that lives in Phoenix. I am looking forward to our next meal there.
