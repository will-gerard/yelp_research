All five stars go to Yancy!!  I've had laser before, several years ago and was thrilled. I remembered how painless it was and the terrific results even after just one treatment (I am terrible at follow up appts, arg!).  Fast forward to now, I purchased a Living Social deal for 6 treatments at Laser For Less.  It's extremely close to my work, and they're super friendly and accommodating of my schedule.  I opted for my highly sensitive underarms, as the ingrown hairs just would not go away.  My first 3 underarm treatments were with another person at this location, but it was painful and a bit torturous.  I had to switch my 4th appt to a different day and was pleasantly surprised to see that I had a new laser tech for my treatment: Yancy.  She sets up the room and table so that I'm most comfortable.  Her technique is perfection - the treatments are painless and quick.  Yancy is the way to go for laser hair removal.  She understands the reaction of the hair follicle and the skin, and does all she can to combat any discomfort.  I have been dazzled and impressed by her skills, and rendered virtually hairless!  Laser 4 Less, specifically Yancy, are top notch and I would proudly recommend them to any friend.

Grazie is one of two go-to restaurants for the bestie & myself.  We've been coming here for a few years now, all times of day and all times of year.  We always try to aim to sit on the patio, it's uber cute and relaxing.  We started off ordering salads, and while they're okay, I'm glad we bit the carb bullet and started ordering their pizzas. Now we always go straight for the pizza and our favorite wine (they're the only ppl we've found in town that have it by the bottle, to purchase, and by the glass. sorry I can never remember the name - I rely on her!).  Our most recent visit included about 10 others, and once again, didn't disappoint. One girl ordered that desert calzone for everyone... Baked pizza dough filled with bananas and Nutella? With mounds of vanilla ice cream on top? HOLY HECK! This is what heaven must taste like!

For the past year and a half, I've had Whitey's service my car whenever something wasn't under the Infiniti warrantee.  And I'm nearly giddy that my warrantee is up, so that I can have only JP's eyes and hands on my precious car.  Whitey's has fit me in whether I was calling the day before or two weeks prior.  This isn't for a lack of business (actually, the place nearly always seems super busy), but because they genuinely want to make their customers happy.  I trust that I'm getting honest opinions, thorough work, and a fair price.  Each time, JP explains what work he did, what work will need to be performed in the near/distant future, and the pricing for it all so that I can be prepared for what I'll spend (and avoid finance-induced heart complications).  Certainly I could go into greater detail about my various experiences at Whitey's, but there's no point when they've all be stellar.  Bottom line?  They're awesome in all the ways that matter, and even some that don't.

Just ate here last night for a Girl's Night Out. I admit, I was uber skeptical when the bestie said Thai.  So happy I put on my big-girl-panties and went along.  I ordered the Hippy Noodles and they were FAB! The served offered the tofu smoked or fried and I went with his recommendation of fried (not my best choice).  But the rest of the dish... wow.  It was one of those meals that I once I took the first bite, I didn't look up until I had shoveled all of into my face. After finishing almost the whole plate, I was satisfied, not full or uncomfortable.  That's the great thing about it - it was light and I could enjoy more than three bites.  :)  Tasted my girlfriend's Jalepeno Fried Rice, which was also totally d-lish.  Someone else ordered the Glass-something Noodles and said they were awesome as well.  She added chicken.  The other three girls all ordered the Chow Mein, and said it was good, but no specific comments there.  It's at a great price, with an awesome & attentive staff.  The ambience is perfection and the location can't be beat.  I'm pretty excited to eat here again... just making a mental list of people I can talk into going!  :)

Called a couple weeks ahead to make reservations for our party, as there were going to be several girls for my bestie's bachelorette party. I was shocked at the rudeness over the phone.  Thankfully, they more than made up for it when we were there.  I took the advice of our server and passed on the Ahi for the Chilean Sea Bass.  That saying, "melts in your mouth" was true in this case.  The spices complimented the fish, and it was cooked to perfection as well.  Each bite was ecstasy.  That's really the only way to describe it.  And as embarrassing at it is, there were moments where I literally closed my eyes to fully enjoy it (and so did the other girl that ordered it!).  I had a bite of someone's sushi roll as well, which was also incredible; so fresh, and uh, last time I checked, Las Vegas is pretty inland, so... wow. Someone else ordered the Miso-glazed Salmon, and raved about that as well.  Lobster wontons, probably not the best choice, opt for something different.  Definitely trust what your server has to say... you can't possibly go wrong!

I used to come here weekly, and always when my dad was in town.  Their food was incredible (almost anything on the menu made dad sublimely happy and he's a mega-foodie), their service was so... Greek-like, and the ambience was perfection. A couple months ago, Dad came to town and insisted we go, it had been too long for him and he was craving it. A big fan of the Moussaka and Oso buco, he ordered what they had on special... and was gravely disappointed.  My salad was bleh, and I mostly just picked at it.  Their whole make-you-feel-like-family vibe had vanished, apparently it was renovated with the interior.  Speaking of, the interior renovations... they did a great job making it look like every other place in Old Town. I have no idea who is running things, but a pink slip is on order. Pronto!

I've been three times now: the first time with a big group/private party where I was dazzled; the second time with a girlfriend where it was ho-hum; and the third time just last week with the boyfriend where I was pretty disappointed.  For the large event, the quality of food was outstanding. I was so excited to try these dishes I'd never had before.  At the time, I was newly vegetarian, and my taste buds were exploding with every bite.  The Lentil Cake Towers blew my mind, and I couldn't get enough of the little bites of heaven.  The second time, I expected the same: outstanding flavors, great service, and an overall terrific experience.  The only thing terrific was the Mango Martini (wowie, it's delicious).  Trying to maneuver the menu options for vegan & gluten free was far too complicated and confusing.  I ordered the Lentil Cake Towers again, and they were delicious.  We also ordered the Seared Tofu as another app, and they were so-so.  I love tofu, but knew I wouldn't be ordering them again.  I ordered the Vegetable Naan Wrap; good but missing... something.  The third time, I insisted we have the Mango Martini.  They were out of a couple ingredients, but the bartender did what he could with what he had - his improvisational attempt was still delicious.  This time, we ordered the Seared Eggplant which had great flavor but was overcooked and soggy; the Lentil Cake Towers, which were good but nowhere near the explosion of flavor the previous two times; and the Vegetable Samosa, which was a disappointment.  The saving grace of the third trip was Gabriel (I'm really hoping that's his name...), the bartender and our server.  He was attentive and on his game.  So much so that my boyfriend commented if he were opening his restaurant here instead of San Diego, he'd snatch Gabriel up in a heartbeat.

I've only been in for breakfast, so I think it's okay to still hold that last star hostage...  Their breakfast menu is brand-spankin'-new and INCREDIBLE.  Their chef, Adam, knows what he's doing.  I met up with some girlfriends for brunch there last weekend and WOW. Absolutely the best Eggs Benedict I've ever had.  There's a grilled avacado snuck in there, and the Hollandaise sauce has a cilantro kick (not a cilantro fan, but this is way mild).  Then there's the red pepper sauce that's drizzled over that.  My mouth is now watering and it's 10pm. And I haven't even mentioned the Bloody Mary.... eh, make that plural, it was brunch.  I also managed to snag a bite (or several) of my girlfriend's Strawberry Pancakes. For the record, I despise pancakes.  She said they were different, and the best she'd had, so I trusted and tasted. And then tasted about 5 more times.  ::sheepish grin::  I don't know what sort of miracle he whipped into that batter but DAMN! The guy knows how to make a stack of hot cakes.  Since the girls and I decided it'll be a monthly event, I'm going to beg Adam weekly to have a Nutella-stuffed French Toast waiting for me next time.  He stuffs French Toast with everything else!  I'm stoked that football season is about to kick into full gear - I'm guessing beer and whatever other surprises Adam starts whipping up will be beckoning me.  And then, that, with the Raiders on massive TVs, Hob Nob will receive that coveted 5th star.

In the past couple of years, I've heard a lot of Splinter.  I've seen the awesome work they turn out, their incredible work ethic, and their passion for what they do each day.  And now, I've experienced it.  I recently had the opportunity to work with Brandon on a project that is smaller in size, but huge in impact.  Our team met with his team in their offices for some brainstorming and content creation (we're both creative groups and wanted very much to have the influence of both groups on our project).  Our varied schedules required us to meet at night, after everyone had put in a full day's work.  I was exhausted, but the energy Brandon brought rejuvenated my brain and (some) of my creative juices.  After a couple hours of focused work and intense brainstorming, we had a plethora of content to work with.  While I wasn't involved in the steps that followed, I was very aware of the authoritative approach Splinter took, recognizing the pertinent details and excellence in our varied and extensive content.  The result? An outstanding product that blew away even my greatest expectations.  I sincerely wish I had more business to take to Splinter, simply because I can recognize greatness when I see it.  I tend to be very technical, often lacking true creativity.  So to be able to work seamlessly with the creatives at Splinter speaks volumes of them.  The ability to interpret what a client is relaying and translate that into a final product that goes so far beyond satisfaction is not just a skill or a talent, it's a gift.  And Splinter has it.

Many, Many things to discuss here...  I drive every month from South Scottsdale to BFE to come to Arrowhead Health.  And getting in with them was harder than necessary. The girls in billing became super rude with me, threatening to cancel my initial appointment because Cigna had transposed my birthdate, and although it was in the process of being fixed, that wasn't good enough for them!  Once I finally got there, it was pretty great.  Their facility is beautiful and big!  I make the drive and dealt with the attitude because I know how awesome Dr. Craig Phelps is, my mom has been a patient for a long time.  I went to see Dr. Phelps because I suspected I had ADD, and he actually listened to me and had me go through the necessary channels to be correctly diagnosed.  We schedule an appointment with Dr. Brues (also uber awesome!!) and between our medical 3-some, we're all on the same page to tackling what other doctors have either a) ignored or b) tried to tell me was just depression.  The office staff is wonderful, and they're accommodating to the point where they are able to draw blood on the premises instead of sending me to wait at Sonora Quest for 2 hours!  If you live in the area, definitely check your insurance for their doctors.  Heck, even if you don't live in the area, I'd recommend Dr. Phelps. He is definitely worth the drive.

I've only experienced a pedicure here, so I can't speak for other salon services offered.  A little over a month ago, I met a friend for pedicures here.  I had called a couple hours prior to make the appointments and was grateful they were able to accommodate us.  We arrived a bit early, and were offered mimosas and to peruse the color selection.  At our appointment time, we were taken back to two side chairs with copper basins placed at the foot of each, filled with warm soapy water.  I had selected a gelish polish, and was advised against it.  The technician offered to pull similar colors, and I was thrilled with one of her selections; it was the exact shade I was looking for!  It was a pleasant enough experience.  The technician I had was very chatty, unexpected as my friend and I had wanted to catch up during this time.  My main concern with her chattiness was the continued diversion of conversation to her drunken antics.  But my toes looked nice and my feet were refreshed, so I was pleased...  Until I wasn't.  While waiting for our toes to dry thoroughly, we were asked to move so they could sit the next appointments.  Although that is understandable, and from my experience the norm, we weren't offered an alternative place to sit.  We shuffled to the front to pay.  Where I was in shock that they charged $48 for a pedicure!  That seemed extreme for a pedicure that didn't offer any luxuries that would have otherwise merited that price.  Adding insult to injury, my pedicure was dingy and tired after 5 days, when it typically takes about 3 weeks for that to happen with my feet.  Overall, I've had much better and was disappointed on many levels with my experience here.

I'd never had Herb Box until earlier this year when one of our Reps brought us it for lunch.  Now? I can't imagine life without it.  I should probably branch out and order something new, but I can't seem to get away from the Veggie & Hummus Pita Wrap.  It tastes healthy, yes, but also, INCREDIBLE! The veggies are tossed in some fab dressing of sort and it's just all sorts of goodness bundled in a fresh pita wrap.  Every time I foolishly gorge and devour the whole thing (eh, I'll just unbutton the pants...) even though I know that the Sweet Potato chips are coming too.  Also which I foolishly gorge!  I can't comment on what it's like there, we always have it brought to us.  But if eating there means its a bit fresher and possibly even better, sign me up!  And now I'm hungry....

Now that the previously reviewed Scottsdale/Shea location is closed, I'm exuberant that the Southbridge/Old Town Scottsdale location is here, as it's much closer to me.  Which I'm trying to take advantage as often as possible.  It's fantastic that I can go somewhere with great vegetarian options and carnivore options, a healthy and fresh focus, and with the stellar ambiance the patio offers.  I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered, and always look forward to going again.  And while it may be a weird quirk of mine, but I truly love when I have options for iced tea! Last time I was there, our server rattled off about 5, and it made me giddy on the inside.  A few visits ago was dinner with girlfriends, to which Amy D. insisted we each go home with a "crack pie", and per the check-in tips on FourSquare from both her and Noelle K., it's a must.  I'm not too proud to say I ate 3/4 of it at home that night, and the rest in the morning for breakfast.  And yes, I did consider stopping there on the way home that next day for more. What? It's CRACK PIE!!!

We stopped by during their anniversary celebration to peruse their selection of bikes, as I'd been in the market for a cruiser for quite a while, but had yet to find the right bike.  After looking around for a bit, we better explained to the guy helping us what I was looking for.  There were a couple bikes they had there that I liked, but I wasn't loving them and they were a bit out of my price range.  He remembered an Electra they had at their other location and quickly pulled up a photo of it.  He also offered to retrieve it from the other site and bring it here for me to check out.  We headed out to run some errands, giving them time to bring the bike over.  When we returned, the bike was there, all ready for me.  A beautiful matte-finish magenta Electra.  My self proclaimed bike genius boyfriend checked it out, and was pleased with everything.  While he fiddled around checking out bikes for himself, I quickly paid, fearing they'd change their mind and not let me leave with this gem!!  The Yelp reviews are mixed, but I had a great experience and have since recommended Bike Exchange to friends.

Seven' Bistro opening is like God's gift to my 2012.  It's a brief walk down the greenbelt from my house, they're open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and the menu looks great - and priced to rock my socks.  The boyfriend and I grabbed lunch yesterday, and as always when I'm picking the place, I'm nervous.  He's worked in the industry and can be snobby when he sees that things aren't done right.  Thankfully, even though Sevens' has only been open a week and a half, he had no complaints!  In fact, he loved it as much as I did.  I ordered the Caprese Grilled Cheese (vegetarian here) and upgraded to the Truffle Fries.  The sandwich was great - even better than I expected.  And the truffle fries? HOT DAMN they were good!  The only downside couldn't be helped by the staff - once the bf got a taste of them, they were suddenly "our" fries.  He ordered the Duck Sliders, and must have been thrilled - he devoured them faster than I've seen him eat most things.  The house-made potato chips came with it, and they were good, just nowhere near the Truffle Fries.  As a boozy beverage guru, he chatted it up with the bartender, Noah (who is awesomely unpretentious and oodles of fun), and ordered the Le Poir.  From my little knowledge of beverages, I'm fairly certain it's essentially a pear martini.  It was refreshing, smooth, and utterly delicious.  The kind of drink that will make me grateful I can walk/stumble home.  On top of the outstanding food, beverage, and service, the decor make me tingle.  It's not over the top or grandiose, but it is simple and beautiful.  A quick swap of the plastic plants for real plants, improving the chalkboard artistry, and shazzam - perfection!  I'm looking forward to many more meals here... I can nearly taste the veggie eggs benedict now.

Hair stylists that mesh well with you are hard to find.  And since my former stylist had moved across country, I'd put off finding a new one for some time.  So I suffered with hideous hair, trimming my split ends myself as necessary.  Just this week I visited Foxtail for my first time.  I was a bit nervous, but more of an excited nervous because despite all the salons I'd been referred to by friends or read about on Yelp, this was the *only* one that gave me feel-good vibes.  Angela did an incredible job with my lack-luster mop.  The choclate-ly color she selected is perfect, it complements my skin and eyes like nothing else has.  She gave me a versatile cut after asking questions on my styling habits/preferences.  I have never been so pleased with my hair!  As for the atmosphere, it's tiny and cute, but with lots of windows that open it up.  All 3 stylists are friendly and obviously pros: there's no awkward tension and they seem to all help each other out.
