Loved my first time here ! Got here by 6pm which was perfect because we beat the rush. I would not want to be here when there is a line, but if you have the time and want a leisurely night out a line is worth the wait even so. However, with that being said do not.come here starving because you do have a bit of a wait for your food, understandable though the place is tiny and the food comes out incredibly fresh !!   We got the fried green tomato sandwich with bacon added it was so good with great textures and flavors..bread a bit too crisp (blackened) at some points but a unique and yummy dish. We also had the bumblebee biscuit sandwich which was really good, the chicken was moist, crunchy , but not filling enough despite it being heavy. We also got the happy hour pork fries, prettty good, but I'll get plain fries next time, liked the slaw and the sauce on top.  Food good, staff was very helpful, local beer, and cool atmosphere.   I would come here again for sure.  I had to deduct one star only because of the bathroom situation ...I'm borderline germaphobe and I almost couldn't stand the bathroom. It's a unisex , airline bathroom size stall with a sliding/folding door, that is right off the kitchen line !! Eek, kinda crazy, just avoid needing a restroom if you are a germaphobe, and even more so if you're extreme about it.   Welcome Diner ,you're great I hope to visit in the summer to keep the spirit alive !

Regret coming here everytime. Not because the food is terrible, it's decent nothing special, but edible and they're open late.   I regret coming here because the customer service is terrible. Is it that hard to HELP your guests, or to be courteous to your guests rather than making it seem as though you have better things to do. Managers aren't any better.   Ugh, annoying.

I love this restaurant! There's such a great neighborhood feel and atmosphere throughout. The menu choices are plentiful with tons of options under each category. I love that you can order the pasta for 2 and share. Also the pizzas have a great amount and layout of the toppings and the crust taste so fresh and is perfectly cooked.   It was nice they were running the $20 additional to $100 special at Christmas. I love places that give back to their guests ! I can't wait to go back and try and sandwich if I can ever say no to pasta.   Recommending the classic Bolognese pasta (i get it with spaghetti noodles) and the pizza with fig and prosciutto...name's slipping me right now. I died over their watermelon salad all summer, can't wait to see it again next season. Service has always been up to par each time I've dined.   Thanks The Parlor for being a great go to!

Closing manager on 2/7/2015 could have cared less that I decided to leave. I politely informed him that we did place an order , but we'd be leaving. His reply, "Please do " I'm sorry but that was enough to have me open a yelp account, just for this review. Why did I leave ? Because after waiting 10 minutes for someone to come over, and getting off my ass to ask for water after no one came over, finally get water, order and ten minutes go by without the waitress coming by to offer drinks we were fed up.  The waitresses here have no sense of urgency and clearly the manager did not care about the guest's experience.  The manager stood there with his arms folded blank stare with no reply but those two words. Sorry RnR but two thumbs down, shame on you for putting someone so careless in charge.  Plain and simple you guys are losing money because your servers are not NEARLY as efficient or politely as they should be, and because management enables this behavior , or at least did tonight.   I will say this "manager" did have a towel hanging out of his pocket maybe he was the bartender/ MOD.

I love this place! We finally returned after waiting for the spring training visitors to leave, and while there was still a wait it was a short 15 minute wait time for the 2 of us.  The hostesses do a great job and always have it together. They're always courteous, and just like everyone else there they work hard. We sat inside as it was first available, which was more than fine. The inside was full, however it wasn't extremely loud like some places get. We always get our food right away and always without mistakes.  I got the Santa fe scrammle which is always good. The serving size says two eggs but it's a huge portion! I like Butter's giving you the choice of fruit, grits, or hash browns, while still giving you the  next choice of pancakes or toast. (when you get an omelette or scrambler) I also added zucchini and peppers to my dish and it was only a $0.25 up charge for each.   My bf got the two eggs, with fruit and bacon as a protein. he also got a short stack of blueberry pancakes. The pieces of bacon are a good size,eggs were scrambled perfectly, and he loves the pancakes every time.  The prices are very reasonable and the servers and bus staff are very attentive.   Thank you Butter's staff so much for letting me wake up and know I have a place for breakfast I can go that won't disappoint.

One star tonight, because when I sit at a bar I would prefer to not hear the bartenders complain about work, and how "pissed" off they were/are. I'm a guest and have to tip you, please don't be a drag, I'm there after my long work day to enjoy myself.   Also sadly there was no thank you from either bartender.   All that aside, good fresh tasting burger and fries . I frequently go there, and will continue to do so.

1 star throughout.... Overall priced , poor quality , poor execution , poor service. On this occasion I got to go food and it was practically inedible. When I do eat inside it's sllooowww service, with a slight improvement to the quality.   I used to work here and I know morale isn't the best, you can kind of sense that no one wants to be there. 700+ stores don't think bbw is going anywhere , I'll ist have to steer clear.

I love coming here and eating at the counter it's quick, friendly, and attentive service.  I have not tried a single thing I haven't loved...deviled eggs, salads, burgers, chix sammy, chips it's all amazing and tastse so fresh every time. They play good music and ordering togo food is easy and quick. I also love the prices I never feel like things are overpriced. Seriously eat here like 5 times a month or more. Need to check out their brunch.   Recommending the chicken sammy, and the lil ingos if you need a chicken and beef fix.   Also can't forget the chocochip and sea salt cookies at the end !

I love coming to scramble, and it's a definite go to when I don't want to wait too long at all.  I enjoy their breakfast wraps, the eggs are scrambled well and the portions are good too. Not too small not huge. I like the lunch wraps and the soups are pretty tasty, though I do add stuff to the wraps to add a bit more of what I like for example avocado which is an up charge of .75 cents which is pretty cheap, however I was kinda bummed they charged for the tomatoes. This is the first time I actually investigated the receipt because of the review, but I never feel the bill is ever too pricey and I'll always order whatever I want.   I tried a smoothie today and I like it a lot. There's no weird aftertaste to it and the consistency is really creamy I got the mango and did banana with it instead of the mango/banana that's on the menu. 20 oz for $5 not bad. I shared it bc I'm not a huge sweets girl anyway.   I sit outside when I can as long as the suns out. Also they often have heaters outside when it's really chilly, however at that point I'm staying inside.  Overall the staff is awesome they go above and beyond when they can and they're all always running around hard at work. I love the order and sit concept. You essentially have 5 servers because anyone working on the floor is willing to act as such. THIS MEANS TIP THEM !! The staff is also aware of their regulars , I appreciate that attention to detail.   Thank you scramble for being, fast, easy, friendly, and delicious !!

Oh my word!!! Your bar staff should be replaced with robots! Quicker, more accurate , and I'm sure a lot more courteous and willing to help you.  I guarantee you are losing $$$ Sooo much $$$  Instead it took me 15 minutes to get a drink when I walked in, despite being front and center up against the bar that whole time. I was constantly overlooked for an order, while others would walk up and get served right away. The person(female) next to me was having the same issue. The male bartender working the well on the side kept looking at both of us...probably wondering why on earth it's taking so long for the two other bartenders to get our order. Anyway long story short my experience was hindered within the first half hour of being on your property.  I got 4 drinks for 2 of us when I finally ordered and I would have gone back for more had I not thought it was going to take me another 15-20 mins. I'm not sure why it's like this....clearly people commonly complain about this.   I guess the money you are losing is made up by not giving your guests complimentary water, another frequently seen complaint.  There'd have to be a huge/unique name to get me back , but even then the place is small and I'm sure would get so packed that it probably wouldn't be worth it.
