Great place to come with friends.  CHEAP happy hour specials such as the giant Nachos, yum :)  Enormous servings, I'm not kidding.  The guacamole appetizer is giant as well, so be careful you bring other people with you or else you will end up wasting yo foods.     Come in, try something different each time you visit and find what you like!  I like the guac, nachos, and tostadas, delicious!

Have been coming here with friends for several years!  DELICIOUS and ridiculously affordable sandwich lunch specials around five bucks.  I always get the falafel sandwich and they let me substitute the tahini for tzatziki, my absolute favorite.  Mango smoothies are delicious and huge for the price.  Fries are thick-cut and yummy.  Lentil soup is also a great choice when you need something to warm your stomach up.   Great atmosphere, clean place, convenient location on Baseline, and friendly service!  Come here, you won't be dissapointed!!

I've lived in the east valley for several years now, and I have been a pretty frequent visitor of Ocean Blue the entire time.  However, when I first started coming here, it was definitely not my favorite fro-yo stop (it just happened to be in a convenient location- Dana Park Mall)... The consistency of the yogurt was runny and the flavors were never my cup of tea.  BUT, lately, I give Ocean Blue a thumbs up!  I came in here a few weeks back and they had Taro flavor, WHAT!?? Yep, Taro!  They also added mochi to their regular toppings a while back.  Original Tart is still my go-to flavor, and it brings me back to the years when I first began my fro-yo addiction.  Great job to Ocean Blue for stepping it up, upgrading to the more popular and unique flavors! They always have something for everyone :)

My friends and I came to Vegas for fun and great food; we were staying at the Aria hotel and decided to take a chance on this place.   The menu choices sounded interesting and I have never been to a Tapas Bar before.  My friend had the huevos dish with "fried potatoes" and chorizo and was a little surprised that she got a plate of eggs, mini sausages over french fries.   She was definitely not that happy with the dish.  I was starving and ordered a little bit too much food for myself.   I had the Bravo potatoes with spicy ketchup which were decent, almost tasted like home fries with tabasco infused ketchup.   I also had the chicken croquettes; I would NOT recommend those to anyone, it honestly tasted like a creamy chicken nugget...  Gross...  For dessert, we had spicy Mexican hot chocolate  with churros.  It had a spicy aftertaste; churros were good, but the hot chocolate was not sweet, just tasted like spice.    I would have given this place a 1/5 except our waitress was excellent, the managers came to check on us often to make sure we were taken care of, and we were seated quite quickly for a busy Saturday night.   GREAT, no, FANTASTIC service, not very appetizing food...   Come in for some tapas if you've thrown back a few and need something quick to eat.

Can we say 'heaven on earth'?  Since I'm basically an over-grown child, Sweeties is the answer to my prayers!  I checked out past reviews before coming here, and I will agree that you should take a walk around before pulling any delicious candy items off of the shelves.  My heart soared as I took a stroll around the aisles and aisles of beautiful sugar-goods throughout the store.  If I am ever having a bad day; trust me, Sweeties is the spot to be!  I tried to remain conservative with what I picked out during this trip but was surprised at the true variety of candy products!  I found Red Super Rope licorice (my favorite treat of childhood), which in the past I was only able to find online.  I also found Buckeye chocolate candies which I though only existed in Ohio and are melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  There were treats from decades ago as well, which I was not familiar with, but I picked up some items that sounded pretty good as well.    The only thing that would have made the trip sweeter would have been if the location was a little closer to my house, or at least closer to the 60 freeway...  It's right around downtown Chandler next to a strip mall and when I walked up I saw a couple breaking into their own car (maybe they left the keys in it?), and I'm not so sure about the neighborhood...    Overall, it was a success; I will be back soon!

Beercheese fondue, what more can really be said?   Came here on a Saturday night, had to make reservations late because the place apparently gets packed.   Had an amazing time with friends.  Service was helpful, competent and attentive.   Such a great range of menu items with unique ingredients.   And of course, cheeeese fondue, my favorite food!    I am not surpised the place fills up quick,  MAKE reservations, okay?

Meh is a perfect descriptive word for this place.  Unfortunately, its the closest fro-yo place to my house so I've actually been here around 4-5 times in the past year.  I usually just come for the Original tart flavor to satisfy my craving; but the flavors are typically limited and not appealing.  I would recommend they bring back a good fruit flavor- strawberry was good and peace- pretty decent as well.    Last time I went in though, the original tart had somehow blended with tart-cherry which was the 2nd flavor in the machine and came out pink= not cool.  I got nutella flavor instead, which wasn't bad, but I've had better chocolate flavors elsewhere...  Then... GASP!  The mochi, my favorite topping in the world (which they only recently have available) was like rock-solid.  Also not cool; it might be a good idea to switch the containers out or not-fill them as full so they get stale so quickly.   Overall, I might give the place another chance since it's so close to my house but please bring back strawberry!

Peach has returned!   I came in today and to my surprise, there was Peach flavor! Yay!  They also had banana, one of my other favorite yogurt flavors.  The consistency was thicker than I remember from my last visit, which I approve as well, noone likes runny, melted froyo...  I am a fro-yo fan for real, and Yogurt Ranch, great improvement since my last time in!

Huge sandwiches for under $5, a steal on the east side of Mesa!   I had the #1 Pepe (gourmet style ham + cheese), without Mayo.  I LOVE provolone, so it was right up my alley.  Chips and a drink extra as a combo for I think under $9).    Extremely fast service, they made our meals directly to order; took literally around 2 minutes.  We came early, a little before 11am so there was no busy rush.    It's good for what it is; just be aware nothing is toasted or hot; they only serve cold sandwhiches.  I'd give it a 3.5 if I could, but I'll round up for fast service.
