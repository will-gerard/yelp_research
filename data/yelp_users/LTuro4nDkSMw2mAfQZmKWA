I'm a big Liberty Market fan and a big Joe Johnston fan as well.  Both this place and Joe's BBQ rock but lets focus on Liberty Market.    Liberty market has one of the greatest atmospheres.  You just always feel at home in this place even when its your first time coming here. The food has always been good, I have tried quite a few dishes here and have always been very happy.  My favorite dish though is the burger.  Get it with some blue cheese and use all of their wonderful burger sauce that you get with the plate and just enjoy.    One thing I MUST mention about Liberty market is the Cortadito.  I know most people have no idea what a Cortadito is.  Well its a cuban style espresso shot which is sweetened with sugar as it is being brewed with a little foamed cream on top.  Or you could also just call it coffee heaven.  if you like coffe at all you MUST get this and try it.  I tend to have two bowls of Cortadito lately every time i go there.  I just cant get enough of it   So long story short is; get your butt to liberty market right now. Don't ask questions just go.  If I didn't live 35 miles from this place I would be there probably every day.  Its just one of those places you want to hang out at and relax.

This is one of those places that i think gets a love or hate following, meaning you either love it or hate it and there is little gray area.  For me I really like Chino Bandido.  I think it also depends on your food combination, because you can certainly get a bad food combo.    First timers need to go up to the bar and get their into to Chino's food tasting.  This is a really good idea and you get a little free food.  The service has always been good and the people who work here have always been really helpful to those that are just a little confused.    For me I get the Black Beans (YUMMY) and jerk chicken rice, with Emerald chicken and a jerk chicken quesadilla.   I really like this combo, it has a little spice in the quesadilla the beans and the rice and a wonderful cooling ginger in the emerald chicken that really compliments the rest of the dish.  I have strayed from this combo quite a few times but always come back to it as i think its the best combo i have found.    This is a place that everyone should try.  Its unique and some people will just love the place and some wont.  But do be warned if you do like it, you will every now and then get a little craving and since its the only place that serves this sort of food you will go out of your way to make it there.

Let me first say that I love Mr. Goodcents Subs.  I just don't like this location.  Every time i have gotten a sandwich from this location there is almost no meat compared to the location next to ASU West.  Usually I get double meat because I am a big guy, and even then it is just a little sad.  Now I have never weighed it and compared it to the other location but it certainly seems like its a lot less.    Finally it drives me nuts that the people behind the counter don't know what a pepperchini is.  I ask if they have them and they say yes. Most of the time what they have is banana peppers but sometimes they actually had pepperchini's.  Never know what you will get but that just frustrated me.   I can say that the people that work here are really nice and that the restaurant is very clean and the food fresh.  But These little things just drive me crazy and i finally stopped eating there even though it was the closest restaurant to my house.

Fajardos is what was once know as Lily's Cafe.  I have been going there since the mid 80's and still love this place.  When Zip the chef and owner died in 2006 we not only lost a great friend but we lost our favorite restaurant.  When the Fajardo family reopened the place it was really like a dream come true.  I still really miss Zip but I know he would be happy that the restaurant lives on without him.   The food is still the same and wonderful. The Salsa is great and I find myself eating a few bowls of it before i ever even get my food.    My suggestions are the green chile soup and the special burrito (once called the Zip burrito.  I do admit though i have never had a dish there i didn't like.    This place is one that you must check out.
