The clothes look great when new...but after the shirts are washed they look horrible.  They were not fitted corrected to begin with and the sales people are unaware of what happens when they are washed.  After two years of just hanging in my closet I finally gave the shirts away - 8 of them.  Some NEVER worn.  They remind me of Target's clothing...looks great on the rack, but once you wear and wash them you should just throw them aside.  Called corporate and they said its up to manager.  Manager says they can do nothing.  I will NOT buy clothing again from Men's Warehouse.  Something isn't above board there

My daughter will NOT return to this place.  Nails we done 2 days ago and they look horrible.  She went it today and was treated very poorly when she asked to have them redone.  I called and complained.  It was very difficult to communicate in English to the staff.

Vincent was an honest and hard working owner.  Great work.  Great price.  They did a great job and even offer a 7 day rain guarantee.  I will be using them again.
