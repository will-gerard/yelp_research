I've always wanted to try macaroni grill and when I finally did, the food didn't impress me. If I'm going to eat at an Italian chain, I'd prefer Carrabbas. The portions are mostly pasta, hardly any meat.

I almost laughed when I looked at the prices on the menu. They have Yardhouse prices for Walmart deli looking food (not trying to be mean). The salad was warm & wilted and when I ordered a glass of wine, there were these small jelly looking balls in it, not quite sure what it was, but I didn't want to risk drinking it. I lost my appetite before dinner.

One of my favorite places to go for a drink & appetizers. The spicy asian wings, fried rice  and yakitori chicken are some of my favorites along with their Tokyo Tea!

Whenever I come here, I'm always satisfied. I've never had one bad dish or one bad drink here. Great for dates or large parties. Highly recommend.

I love their chicken fried rice, steak & chicken dish and my husband loves their sushi & shashimi dishes. Cocktails aren't the greatest, but the saki bombs aren't bad (can't really mess those up).

This place is amazing. Good food, lots of good flavor. I don't eat sea food, so I had a chicken po' boy and loved it! Red beans & rice are also on point!

Food is very similar to Pei Wei, just double the price and a more upscale environment.

They have a great lunch special with a slice of pizza and a salad for a reasonable price and it's definitely filling. I've also had great service every time I've been.

Their chicken teriyaki is extremely fresh and full of flavor (especially with sriracha) and their thai tea with boba is amazing.

Food was great. I had the steak and potatoes with a side of peppercorn sauce and loved it. Drinks are also good.

My husband is from Michigan and gets homesick often and I FINALLY found a place that brings him back home!

We've been coming here for years and love it. Only movie theatre I will go to in AZ. Besides iPic (if I feel like wasting money for another nice theatre).

This place is definitely a hidden gem! Crepes (breakfast, lunch & desserts) are all amazing. Their green tea is also good.

Coffee is great and I love that they give stamp cards with incentives for free coffees.
