The hip couple that works there were really genuine and resourceful. My family and I were looking for a certain kind of goldfish (ranchu) and thankfully they had beautiful ones in stock. They also have a great return policy, so if they get sick in a x amount of days, the fish were returnable. Fins & Friends also have a variety of quality fresh and salt water fish. They also have great deals!  The lovely lady and funny gentleman welcomed us with great customer service that it makes this shop worth driving from East Valley (gilbert) !!! Thank you Fins & Friends for taking care of us!   P.S, The young 50's lady was downloading Destiny (video game) at work. Seriously..... HOW COOL IS THAT!

Called Phoenix Tropical Fish to inquire about what they had in stock, primarily fancy goldfish. The lady who I talked to a couple of times did not have any phone etiquette or manners at all. Point made, I experienced terrible customer service and don't think that I would visit this place at all.
