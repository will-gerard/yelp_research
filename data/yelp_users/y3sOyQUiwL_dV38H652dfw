We arrived at Wild Thaiger on a Friday night at 5:45. The restaurant was busy but there were 3 empty tables and one group of 3 before us that was waiting in the outside patio area. The hostess was nowhere to be seen. About 5 minutes later, she shows up and takes down our names and tells us it will be about 10 minutes for a table for two. We're fine with that so we agree to wait inside the restaurant as it was pretty cold outside. Ten minutes pass. The group of 3 before us is still waiting and the 3 empty tables are still empty. In the meantime, about 5 other groups of people have come in after us and put their names down for tables. The hostess disappears again at 6pm. I noticed this because I looked at my phone and the 10 minute wait was now 15 and the group before us still had not been seated. About 5 minutes later, the hostess comes back to seat the group of 3 and disappears again. Two couples come into the the restaurant and after waiting 5 minutes at the hostess station, one of the couples walks to the back, hoping to get someone's attention so they  can put their name down for a table. We watched them stand there for 5 minutes and then walk out of the restaurant. 6:15. No sign of the hostess. Other people have arrived and walked out as well. We see the hostess clear a table and then bring to go boxes to a table and walk right by us. She doesn't make eye contact, she doesn't apologize, she doesn't tell us it will be just a few minutes. In fact, she scurries away so quickly, she doesn't hear us when we say "Excuse me, miss?" to get her attention to find out how much longer it will be. Most of the people who were in the restaurant when we arrived are now finishing their meals. It's 6:25 and the hostess has been away from her station for 25 minutes. Our 10 minute wait was 40 standing up without so much as an apology or offer of water or a drink while we waited. We decided to leave and as we walked out, wished the 6 groups of people behind us "good luck". Maybe they'd get one of the still empty tables.   The front of the house is EVERYTHING in the restaurant world. That girl probably just cost the restaurant thousands in future business. I've heard great things about the food but I'll never go back.

They were able to do a gel manicure and spa pedicure on short notice/walk in basis. They were friendly but unfortunately the male nail tech cut so deeply into my cuticle that it bled for about 30 minutes while he was doing my nails. He tried to stop the bleeding with super glue (or something like it) but the bleeding started up again when he was applying my color. I thought he was going to throw the bottle of polish away after he finished with me (since my blood was now on the brush that he used to apply the color and now, in the bottle!) but instead it went back on the shelf. I doubt this happens often but I won't be going back.

We are thinking about getting a new pet buddy for our current cat but wanted to have him checked out first to make sure he was in tip top shape. I looked for a vet nearby that had good reviews on Yelp. I came across All Creatures Animal Clinic and after reading all of the great reviews, I decided to call them to set up an appointment. The tech who answered the phone was friendly and helpful. I had to have my cat's records sent from my previous vet to All Creatures and when I arrived, everything was in order. Oh, I forgot to mention, they were able to see me on the same day that I called without an additional charge.   When we arrived, we were pleased to find a large, comfortable and clean waiting room. We were seen less than 10 minutes after our arrival and after a few questions from the vet tech, we were seen by Dr. Bob. The reviews were right! Dr. Bob was patient and informative and asked us several questions about our cat's history and previous health. Our cat has not had the best experience with visits to the vet but today, he was the calmest I've ever seen. We come from a state where rabies vaccines are mandatory even for indoor cats and he let us know the regulations in Arizona are not as stringent. He also gave us great advice for when we decide to get our new cat; everything from what to feed him to how to socialize him with our current cat.   All Creatures Animal Clinic will definitely receive our business when we bring our new member of the family home and we will continue to come here for all of our current kitty's needs!

Al was fantastic! I am a Realtor with an out of state client that needed repairs done to her staircase before her home was sold. After calling several area staircase companies (and told that the job was too small), I was lucky enough to hear back from Al. He was polite, provided a quick estimate, called to confirm and showed up on time! In addition, he did a fantastic job supporting a very wobbly staircase for my client and future buyer. I work with a lot of clients that are in constant need of quality and reliable contractors. I would recommend Al Soto of Classic Stairs in a heartbeat!

I had really high expectations after I read the reviews. We ordered the combo appetizer platter and were underwhelmed. The eggroll consisted of bland, greasy cabbage and no meat. The wonton was dried out and the filling was a little dollop of what looked to be sweet potato. The satay was rubbery and inedible and if I had never had Thai toast before, Swaddee's Thai would ensure that I would never order it again. We had higher hopes for the entrees and again we were disappointed. My boyfriend ordered the Yellow Curry and I ordered the Pad Thai. We both asked for medium hot. What he received was a watery curry flavored soup with no heat. I got a plate full of watered down noodles that tasted like they came from a box with a flavor packet that you add on later. I hate writing critical reviews but this was truly one of the most mediocre Thai restaurants I have ever been to.

This rating is long overdue. My husband and I had a fantastic experience with Bob Corelli at Sunset fence. They demo'ed out the common wall 100' chain link fence, trenched, poured a concrete foundation, set rebar and added a 100' long, 6' high block wall (to perfectly match my other block wall). They also repaired deteriorating block at two separate places on my other wall (free of charge). Total job was about $3500 and after permits were in place, it took 2 days to complete.

When we used to live in Peoria, we would go to Greek Wraps about once a week. Their hummus is to die for. I've actually never had anything less than terrific there. Everything from the veggie pita wrap with grilled eggplant and onions smothered with their special yogurt sauce to their grilled lemon kebab with garlic sauce is amazing.   There is always a line at Greek Wraps and expect a wait. The food is made fresh to order and the portions are plentiful.   I wish they had delivery!

Over priced, over rated and (look out) over head. We had heard such great things about this restaurant that perhaps we set our hopes too high...  We went to Pizzeria Bianco a few months ago for lunch. It was a bit after the lunch rush, so we didn't have to wait but the restaurant was pretty full.   The menu is a bit sparse but we figured that it was so good, they were concentrating on quality vs. quantity of menu offerings. We ordered the handmade buffalo mozzarella and basil caprese salad and a "sonny boy" pizza that had salami and gaeta olives. Bianco claims that they use local tomatoes and I'm not disputing that they do. However, we went in the height of the tomato season when heirlooms are at their peak and plentiful at the farmers market, yet they served us tasteless, limp tomatoes with a schmear of balsamic. I never salt my food but the mozzarella should have been brined when they made it as it had no flavor.  For a $9 appetizer, it simply was not up to par.  The pizza was also underwhelming. The crust was ok but the toppings were minimal and the cheese on top was barely cooked. I was sitting in the table at the far corner near the front of the restaurant and I kept seeing speckles of dust in the air. I made the mistake of looking up and I saw that the wooden beams in this restaurant have about an inch of dust on them that flaked down on me and my pizza during the course of my meal. I was kind of too grossed out to continue eating and I was actually too embarrassed for the restaurant to tell the wait staff who probably couldn't do anything about it anyway.   Hopefully, they have done a deep cleaning of the restaurant in the last few months. Honestly, if you have ever looked at the dust that accumulates on your ceiling fan if you haven't cleaned it in awhile, it looked like that x 10. Our simple lunch was about $30.. Maybe they charged us an extra topping for the dust.

We went to Sauce a couple of weeks ago before a visit to the dentist. We were looking for a place where we could get a quick and tasty lunch in the area and didn't want to pay for over priced sandwiches at AJ's. As we were driving around the Dana Park shopping center, we passed by Sauce and decided to check it out.   Ordering is easy at a cashier and the selections include gourmet pizzas, salads, sandwiches, bruschetta and freshly made soups. Service was friendly and our order of a veggie pizza and salad came to less than $20. We were checking out the decor and less than 10 minutes after we had ordered, our food was delivered to our table with a smile. The salad was great; lightly dressed and a good sized portion. The pizza was better than I expected. Super thin, wafer like crust and just enough toppings to not miss anything but not so much that you are full after one or two slices. The sauce was fresh and both the pizza and salad were more than enough to serve two for lunch. As we were finishing up, my boyfriend noticed that this was a Fox Restaurant Concepts restaurant. If you've been to a FRC place before, it makes sense. Well done, Sauce. We'll be back!

I love West Coast Plumbing & Air! I had a home inspection that turned up some slight issues with the air conditioning unit of a home that I am purchasing. I wanted a second opinion, so I contacted WCP&A first thing on Monday morning. Justin, who answered the phone was polite, courteous and scheduled the appointment for today. About 20 minutes ago I received a call from John (whom I believe is one of the owners) who stated "I would love to say that there is something wrong with the unit and you need work (joking of course) but I couldn't find anything wrong with it". Not only did he ease my fears, he stated that he wasn't going to charge me since he was already in the neighborhood! I am a Realtor and this won BIG brownie points with me. Not only will I give them my future business, they can count on me for future referrals for all of my clients!!

We needed a security door with metal screen to front door and a window guard to a side window on our garage. From the initial contact to installation, First Impression met every expectation. We called a few other companies and were getting the run around. When we called First Impression, we were greeted by a pleasant girl on the phone who scheduled our free, in home estimate.   The pricing was slightly higher than what we were hoping but the quality is worth it. You get what you pay for. The in home salesman was pleasant and described the types of doors we could get, the time it would take to deliver and install and measured another door for us that we might want to have serviced in the future. We paid upfront and received a cash discount as well as our $100 off for being an Angie's List client. We were called the next day for the scheduling a month later.    A day before our scheduled installation, we received a confirmation call and I received a call on the day of when my technician was on the way. This is how ALL COMPANIES SHOULD DO BUSINESS! Michael showed up on time and went through the process of installation with me. He was friendly, efficient and clean. Installation took about 4 hours from start to finish.  Total price was $1,500 and time from initial consultation to install was about a month.

As most reviewers have already pointed out, Al Hana, located in the Baiz Market, is not in the best of neighborhoods but the food, the prices and service with a smile will have you coming back for more. We ordered tabouli, hummus, shisk taook a falafel plate and 2 bottles of water (sorry, no cocktails here). The bill came in at just under $28 and we paid at the counter. Our food was quickly prepared and was ready in less than ten minutes. Everything was delicious and the portions were generous. The baklawa is actually to the rear of the store at a separate counter and there are many varieties to choose from. We will absolutely come back not only for the food but also for the vast selection of middle eastern and international foods sold at Baiz Market. After our meal, we spent another half hour in the store picking up various items to stock our pantry. All meats sold at Baiz are Zabiha and Halal.

When we lived in Peoria, we would go to Satara Thai about once a month. Personally, I think the food here is excellent. The service on the other hand, left a lot to be desired.   Earlier this year, the management changed and we visited Satara a couple of times before we moved to Paradise Valley. I have to say that the service was greatly improved.   Not dwelling on the past, I would definitely suggest Satara. The spring rolls are delightful and served with sweet chili and plum sauces that pair nicely with the delicate flavors of rice noodles and vegetables. My boyfriend would usually order the chicken panang curry, black pepper beef or the gangalee curry chicken. I am a fan of the pad thai and would rarely stray from this item on the menu, electing to sample bites from Shawn's plate. I've never had anything at Satara that I haven't liked.   My only suggestion would be to have a specialty cocktail menu. They might have this now but as of the last time we visited in March, they didn't.   New management has bumped up their score and now I would give Satara an easy 4. Good eats!

I went to Pho Thanh because I was in the mood for some great Vietnamese and the reviews won me over. I went on a Saturday about 11am and was a bit confused by the customer formed order line vs. paying customer line. We were pleasant enough to allow the next person in line to go through ahead of us and I placed my order for vegetarian spring rolls on rice vermicelli and egg noodles served with stir fry vegetables with NO TOFU. I waited off to the side by the take out cartons and was impressed by how quickly the staff got the food out to the tables and the fact that the entire restaurant was full, consisted of a mixed crowd and people obviously loving what they were eating. My food came about 15 minutes after I placed my order and I raced home to eat. Unfortunately, there was shrimp in my "veggie" egg rolls. My mother is deathly allergic, thankfully, I am not but I don't like shrimp at all. Luckily, I spotted them and just pulled them out. My veggie noodle stir fry had tons of tofu in it, so I pulled that out as well. The food was good but I was upset that they didn't really pay close attention to my order. I'll definitely go again, but I'll dine in, so if my order is incorrect, I can have them fix it. I'll also try Da Vang to see how they compare.

OMG! La Condesa, I love you!   If you drive too fast down 16th on your way downtown, you just might miss this little, neighborhood taco joint...and it will be your loss.   La Condesa is a delightful little 10-12 seat restaurant with seating also available at the bar. The wait staff are courteous, helpful and knowlegable about the food. There is a salsa bar with no less than 15 freshly made salsas.. everything from your standard pico de gallo to a strawberry jalapeno and a spicy chipotle peanut. We've been here a few times and have not been disappointed. Try the Sonoran Carne Asada Arrachera steak marinated with Mexican herbs, fresh garlic & olive oil, charbroiled with mesquite charcoal or the Mayan Cochinita Roasted Pork Shoulder Taco with marinated onions and salsa habanera. If you order the "taco plate" for a few dollars more, you can get sides of their slow cooked beans and rice.  This is a place nice enough to take your mom and trendy (and inexpensive) enough to take your out of town hipster friends.   Total neighborhood foodie heaven on a budget.

I had water dripping from somewhere inside my fridge. Over the course of a few days, there were several cups of water that had accumulated underneath the vegetable bins and dripped onto the floor. After doing some research on Angie's List, I called Affordable Appliance Repair and explained the issue. They had someone come out the same day, assessed the problem (a clog in the drain line) and had it repaired in minutes. The scheduler and technician were extremely professional and friendly and I felt that the charge was appropriate for the work done. The tech (Rene) called me 30 minutes prior to arrival and arrived exactly when I expected him to. Would definitely hire again!

We stopped by Rice Paper a few months ago for a quick bite to eat before seeing a movie at the Phoenix Film Bar. Looking for something exotic, inexpensive, fast and within a 10 minute drive to our final destination, we brought up Yelp! on my phone and searched for nearby restaurants.   I love Vietnamese food. So much so, that when I lived in California and I would go back east to visit my family, I would drive an hour in rush hour traffic in Arlington, VA to go to my absolute favorite Vietnamese place called Cafe Dalat. Anyone familiar with traffic in the DC area knows this restaurant must have been amazing to suffer a voluntary 2 hour commute and it was. Alas, Cafe Dalat has since closed and that is a different story for a different day.  Pulled over on the side of the road and huddled over the phone, we saw that there was a new, modern Vietnamese place within a few minutes drive and that had great reviews and our minds were made up.   The restaurant is a small but well designed coverted store front house on 7th Street in downtown Phoenix.  Although they specialize in spring rolls and fresh rice paper rolls, they also offer a selection of pho (soup), goi (salad), bahn-mi (sandwiches) as well as a few mini entrees. If you get 2-3 rolls per person and share a soup or mini entree, you'll be full by the time you leave. The service is pleasant, knowlegable and efficient. The bathrooms are unisex. The seating is cozy and intimate- think party of 2 or 4 rather than 6-8 although if you get there early enough, there is a bar style table in the middle of the restaurant that can seat around 6 people.   As for the rolls, my favorite were the crispy "Budda" and the fresh veggie tempura soft rice paper roll. If you are looking for a meat filled roll, try a traditional pork or grilled chicken with basil roll served with hoisin sauce.   The last time we went, I think we ordered crispy calimari and lemon grass chicken with garlic noodles; both great. We were sitting next to a woman and her daughter who were both eating Pho and the fragrance of it was so amazing that I had to ask them how it was. The mother said that it was some of the best Pho in town and if it wasn't 115 in August, we probably would have ventured to try some.   At around $15-20 per person including a cocktail (they have great HH prices too), this was definitely a modern take on some Vietnamese classics.

I found Jenny through Yelp! after I purchased a gorgeous, vintage dress from Almond Tree Boutique that was a size too small and needed a lot of work in order to fit my curves. I met with Jenny and she immediately took my measurements, listened to what my needs were and informed me that she would have to completely open up the dress to see how much extra material she had to work with. Jenny put in a corset for me, took in the bust, let out the hips and rear and took in the waist. It was a total of 4 or 5 visits until it fit like a glove but she did not stop until she had it perfect. I received so many compliments on my wedding day and Jenny had a lot to do with that! I would highly recommend her!

I was driving down Cave Creek Road last week and happened to catch a sign for Thai food as I passed. I was on my way to meet a client so I didn't have time to stop and check it out but a few days later I did a Google search for "Thai Restaurant Phoenix Cave Creek" and Pete's E San Thai Cuisine came up. This had to be the place.   We arrived at the restaurant about 6:00 pm on a Saturday and the parking lot was empty. Slightly hesitant, we ventured in. The decor was great and is a mix of Thai ornamental meets modern city loft. The bartender/barback immediately came to greet us and was super friendly. He told us it was BYOB and there was a QT around the corner if we needed to get wine or beer for our meal. We thanked him and pulled back into the parking lot about 15 minutes later.   When we came back to the restaurant, there were now 3 groups of people in the previously empty restaurant and we were greeted by Robert, our waiter for the evening. Robert obviously knew several of the diners and as we were seated, more groups came into the restaurant, even saying "Hi Robert!" across the room. To say that Robert was friendly and accommodating would be an understatement. He made us feel completely welcome and explained where the chef was from, the style of cuisine we would be eating and a bit of history about the restaurant.   We inquired about the Thai spring rolls and we were informed that they were out. He also explained that everything on the menu is made to order, with local ingredients and always from scratch. Robert suggested that we try the "Thai Toast", which we were a bit skeptical about but after he explained that it is a traditional crispy fried pork delicacy with panko breading, we decided to go for it. We also ordered yellow curry and pad thai.   The Thai Toast was fantastic, better than I had expected and it came with a great little cucumber salad. Be sure to ask for the sweet and sour sauce as well. We ate half of the Thai Toast and realized that we hadn't saved much room for our entrees. When our meals arrived, they were flavorful, spicy and nothing you would expect from a little unassuming place on the corner of Cactus and Cave Creek Road.   Pete's Thai has an inexpensive buffet at lunch and is priced moderately when compared to other Asian/Pan Asian restaurants. I'd give the flavor 4.5 stars and the service a 10! We are looking forward to our next visit!

We stopped by Madras Ananda Bhavan about a month ago when we were at the Harbor Freight Tools in the same shopping center craving something for lunch. We were pretty close to home but as we neared the parking exit on the 32nd Street side of the shopping center, we eyed this restaurant. We decided to pull over and check it out. There was a lunch buffet going on but neither of us were that hungry.  They were not serving off of the menu but we asked if we could just get an order of samosas to go. The manager told us he would check with the chef and when he came back he said they could do it no problem. We thought this was nice and it convinced us to come back for dinner that following weekend.   I think it was a Saturday around 6ish. When we arrived, there were about 2 or 3 other groups of people, predominately Indian (a good sign) already enjoying their meal. As we sat down, we were greeted by the manager and another host. Both were friendly and recognized us from earlier in the week. The place smelled amazing and I couldn't wait to order.   We noticed that the restaurant began to fill up and before we knew it, the entire right hand side of the restaurant was full of families coming in for a traditional, south Indian meal.  We ordered Samosas, Aloo Mutter, Saag Paneer, Dal Makhni and naan. Our samosas were flavorful and served with both tamarind and mint chutneys. Our entrees were served shortly there after and were excellent. There were a few more "pods" (cardamom, cumin) than I prefer but I know that it adds to the flavor, so I was more careful to look before each bite and pick out some of the chili's and seed pods before I took a bite. All in all, everything was absolutely delicious!  Oh! Madras is all vegetarian and alcohol free, so no cocktails or meaty bits here. We didn't let that dissuade us and honestly, the food here is so flavorful, you don't even miss it. Needless to say, we did stop off for a bottle of Pinot on the way home and enjoyed the rest of our evening in.   Two thumbs up!

We had such an amazing experience at North Fattoria Italiana last Saturday night! Service was exceptional and the food was fantastic! Our server Vanessa was friendly, courteous and knowledgeable and the manager came by to our table to make sure that everything was up to our expectations. We had house salads, crispy potatoes with pecorino & aioli, pizze stracciatella, tagliatelle with sauce bolognese, spinach tortelloni and the summer fruit crostata. If you haven't been to this neighborhood gem in Arcadia, make your reservations now!

This review is long overdue. Partially because I keep telling myself that I'm going to write a review after the next time I go to Khyber Halal. So, after our 4th dining experience there, here I go!  The first time we tried to go to Khyber Halal, we were able to go inside the restaurant but they told us they weren't doing dinner service because they were catering a banquet dinner off site. No problem, we made arrangements to go back a few weeks later. Our next visit was during Ramadan. We didn't know that until we arrived to see a big sign on the door saying that they were observing the month long holiday.   Not to be deterred, we came back a few weeks later and were seated by a friendly, young man (presumably, the owner's son?) and we waited. and waited. Finally, about 10 minutes later, I was able to call someone over to take our order and get waters for the table. We ordered the chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, mantoo, samosas and brown rice. The samosas were a bit dry and the chutney that was served with them was nice but in styrofoam containers. I have absolutely nothing but positive things to say about the rest of the meal. Fantastic, flavorful and probably impossible to beat for the prices at this restaurant. Our waters weren't refilled throughout our meal but we almost didn't notice because the food was so good. We didn't need to order extra naan as they make sure you get enough bread to feed an army. With an appetizer, a few sides and three entrees, our meal was less than $40.   Our next 3 visits were a bit more of the same. Lackluster service, outstanding food. It's why we keep going back. I keep saying I wish someone would nominate Khyber Halal for a Restaurant Impossible or Kitchen Nightmares type show. They need a visual makeover and the sons could take a lesson in service. Again, they are super friendly but have probably never worked in a restaurant before. This place would be a 5 if they could get their skills up to par a bit.   Don't let the service keep you away. If this place was around the corner from me, I'd be here a few times a week for lunch. See you soon Khyber!

So, we've been back to Khyber Halal no less than 5 or 6 times since my last review. The food is still fantastic and I have noticed a change in service... for the better! We are quickly seated and the staff recognizes us when we come in, often making suggestions about new dishes or provide a detailed explanation when we inquire. We tried to go a couple of weeks ago but the restaurant was closed due to a funeral :(. If you haven't tried this place already, what are you waiting for??!

First off, I'd like to say that I really enjoy the food at Gina's. Unfortunately, my experience with them from June-July was an absolute nightmare..   I first learned about Gina's when I purchased their burratta at my local farmer's market, It was great and when speaking to the rep at the farmer's market, I learned that they sold wines, pizzas, homemade sauces and more at their Scottsdale store location. I started going about once a month and purchasing pizza's, biscotti and wine. I learned that they were starting to hold classes and I was super excited. Even though my boyfriend was out of town, I signed up for their cheese making class in January. I had been wanting to learn how to make mozzarella cheese for years. The class was great. I met some wonderful people and even though the class was a bit crowded, it was totally worth the money.   When I had the chance to tell my boyfriend about it, he wanted to sign up too, so a pasta making class, sauce making class and several trips to their retail store in the following months, we thought we had found a great, neighborhood spot to meet like minded people and learn how to make great Italian food.   The last class we took was in May and they told us that they were going to have a "food rave" on June 8th which would consist of endless amounts of food, wine and great music, etc. My boyfriend was out of town but I knew it would be a great night, so I paid $100 and signed up. I was looking forward to it for weeks and on the day of the event, I was nervous about how formal it would be, so I called to ask about the dress code. I received an email two hours before the event from one of the owners, Chris Buskirk to tell me that the event had been cancelled due to an illness of one of their children. In the email he asked if I wanted to use the $100 as a credit for product in the store or a credit to a future class. I wrote him back less than 3 minutes later and stated that I was sorry to hear that their kids were sick and said that I'd like to use the money for a future class. In fact, I knew that there was an appetizer class being held on June 25th, so I would call later in the week and reschedule for that class. I figured that since that class was cheaper, both me and my boyfriend could go!  I never heard anything back. EVER. I called a few times a week for the next two weeks, sent emails... nothing. June 25th passed and I missed out on the appetizer class. The few times that I would not get an answering machine and actually got an employee on the phone, they would tell me that they personally delivered my message to both of the owners and they didn't know why they weren't calling me back. I felt like a stalker. None of my emails were addressed, none of my phone calls were EVER returned. I wanted to go to the store in person but felt embarrassed and awkward. I kept trying to call for another few weeks and each time the owners were never available but the messages had been delivered according to the staff. I was utterly confused. I still am. Eventually, when it had been a full month of me trying to get in touch with them to no avail, I contacted my credit card company to have the money refunded to my account.   To this day, I never received an explanation, an apology or anything. I still don't understand what happened. I think their food is still good but the way they treated me was absolutely horrendous. This is NOT the way a local business should treat their loyal, paying customers.

I've been hearing great things about this place and unfortunately, I was underwhelmed. I stopped by on Sunday and ordered 2 burritos to go. I was told it was going to be a 15 minute wait. I don't mind waiting for good food, so I placed my order and waited. My order was brought out to me and I raced home in extreme anticipation. Both burritos were wrong. My bf got chicken, beans, rice, sc, guac, cheese and lettuce. His was missing the guac, sour cream and cheese. I ordered a carne asada with everything. What I received was a carne burrito with only rice and beans. It was bland and some of the carne was gristly. The rice was overdone and the tortillas were made with waaay too much lard. Sorry, first impressions make a big difference to me and I will not be going back.

We stopped by Thailicious around 6:30 on a Saturday night just before going to see a friend perform at a nearby venue in Chandler. We were greeted and seated promptly, as well as presented with cocktail menus, suggestions and dinner menus. The service was wonderful and the food was great. I ordered Pad Thai and my husband had the Royal Yellow Thai Chicken curry, both ordered with medium heat. We also shared crispy spring rolls, which were bright, fresh, and not overly greasy. We would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great Thai restaurant in Chandler!

I came to this dealership in June after many months of research on my next vehicle. Before purchasing, my husband and I needed to complete our home refinance, so we could not make any large purchases that might affect our credit. The Kia dealership on Camelback was the 4th dealership we visited and were warmly greeted by Rose. This review is primarily for everyone else at the dealership  (with the exception of Rose and the finance guy, Craig).  I informed Rose of our refi and that we wouldn't be purchasing until after July. We test drove 2 vehicles, the Sorento & Sportage and went home to discuss.   I received multiple phone calls over the next few weeks asking me if I was ready to purchase.  I found this annoying as I had clearly stated (and they took notes) that I would not be ready to purchase until the first week of July.   We came back to the dealership on 7/2  at 11am and decided that the Sorento was the vehicle that we wanted to lease. We met with Rose and test drove the 2016. I wasn't interested in the 2016 as I had seen their nationally advertised ads for the 2017 Sorento at an attractive lease price. The 2017 model was always what I had wanted. My car was appraised low initially and after questioning the value they were giving me, they came up another $2k by calling the dealership across the street that I originally purchased from (all of the dealerships in this particular section of Camelback Rd are owned by the same company, so we were told). At that point, we were told that we needed to speak to someone other than Rose to talk about the lease price of the vehicle. This is where it got confusing and annoying. My current vehicle was under water but I had enough cash to make it whole (along with the money they were offering me for my trade in.  With the additional money I was going to pay them for the lease fee, they were still trying to charge me over $100 more per month than the nationally advertised lease price. We negotiated pricing for over two hours and I had to pull up their ad on their computer to show them that the pricing they were offering didn't make sense.   When they finally got to a price I could live with (still $30 more per month than the Advertised price), I asked to make sure it was a 2017 model. The sales guy told me it was for a 2016 even though I had mentioned that I only wanted a 2017 and that was the Ad we were looking at on the computer for the last two hours! In addition, the sales guy failed to mention that the price I had signed off on didn't include another $30 in taxes and fees! At that point, I was ready to walk out. We had been in the dealership for about 4 hours at this point and I was over it.  His manager finally came out and told me that they didn't have any 2017s in the color I wanted on the lot.  To be fair, they were trying to offer a 2017 V6 model but I did not want that because the MPG significantly goes down with the V6 model. They also weren't offering the same price.   So, closing in on 5 hours I decide to just buckle and go with the 2016 model as long as they can honor the initial price that we had negotiated, prior to when they added additional taxes and told me it was not the 2017 model I wanted. We waited another 2 hours for the car to get detailed and to get processed with the financing guy.   When the vehicle was finally delivered after the 7th hour with 2 pretty large paint chips and no floor mats (they gave me the mats after it was pointed out they were missing), I was exhausted and starving. They told me someone would be calling me to schedule the car to come in and have the paint chips repaired.   I received a call on 7/12 asking me how everything was going. I said I still had not been called to schedule for the paint chips to be fixed and the woman on the phone said someone would call me back.   It's 7/14 and I'm still waiting for that call.  UPDATE: After calling again last week, I finally received a call back to have the paint chips taken care of at the dealership and made an appointment for 9am on a Friday 7/22. Upon my arrival, I was told the work would take "a few days". This would have been fine if they had a loaner car for me to use as I had to work for the next three days but unfortunately, all of their loaner cars were unavailable/in use. They told me that they would call me to reschedule the work when they have loaner cars available, so here I am again..... waiting for that call.

I host an ethic lunch group that meets every Thursday and today, we went to lunch at Coup Des Tartes. Our lunch was planned for 1:00 pm and when I arrived at 12:50, I waited in the front host area for about 5 minutes before I started walking around looking for where my group was. I ended up running into one of the servers who had her hands full but cheerfully greeted me and led me to my group which was already seated in the dining room.   My group is full of foodies and admittedly, we are very particular about... well, just about everything! The two servers that tended to us were extremely helpful and patient (even when we sent them running back to the kitchen to find out where the salmon and crab was from) and very knowledgeable about their menu, making suggestions to my group when asked. Our waters were continually filled (as was my coffee) and every single person at the table RAVED about their food. I had the french onion soup which was good but the croutons could have been slightly crispier before they added the cheese and browned it in the oven. We arrived at 1, ordered around 1:25 and finished our meals between 2:30-3pm. Some in our group opted for dessert and were again very happy with the quality of the dessert (I believe both diners had the brown butter pear tarts). Overall, I would highly suggest this restaurant and I plan on coming back in the fall when I can enjoy the gorgeous patio dining area outside!
