If I keep having flashbacks about my lovely dinner here last night, then it must be worthy of 5 stars.   Husband and I went here for a late dinner last night on our anniverary-eve. It was a Monday, and there were only two other couples there, so it was nice and quiet. The ambience is relaxed and warm, and our server was attentive and informative, but not smothering.  We started with a three-cheese plate. They have a long list of cheese varieties from which to choose. We got the Truffle Tremor (goat), Abbaye (Sheep) and Three Sisters of Serena (cow). It comes with baguette slices, pear slices, strawberries, grapes, dried cranberries, almonds, and a delicious candied-syruppy-dried-fruit-and-nut combination.  I ordered the duck for my entree, and it was superb. The duck breast was excellent, but the best part was the blue-cheese-potato croquette and the diced mango and poblano relish. I could have licked my plate.   We were too full for dessert, but they looked great.  I loved that you can order half-glasses of wine. It gave me a chance to taste a couple of different kinds without a)breaking the bank, and b)getting so sloshed that I couldn't drive home.  I enjoyed everything about my experience here. The only drawback to the entire meal was that the server told us that the mac-and-cheese plate was big enough for a meal, but when it came, it was actually pretty small (perfect size for a starter). Husband insisted that it was just enough, but I would have preferred he have a bigger main course. But I digress.  Expect to pay upwards of $50/person if you go all out and order wine, starters, and entrees, but this could easily be an affordable dinner at happy hour or if you just get a few starter plates to share. The portions are adequate, but not really big enough to take home leftovers.  I can't wait to go back to sample some more wine and cheese!

Had brunch here this morning (Sunday), and there was exactly one other table of diners there the whole time we were there. I don't understand why this place was so empty when Matt's Big Breakfast has lines out the door. Oh well, better for me.   Once again, Cheuvront did not disappoint. The blueberry muffins that come to the table, piping hot, were lovely. I ordered the Eggs Benedict Cheuvront, which consists of lightly poached eggs, black forest ham, and a delicious poblano hollandaise over a toasted baguette. The potatoes on the side were spiked with rosemary and so tasty dragged through the hollandaise (but then, what isn't?).  My friends ordered the egg white omelet and the fritatta, and both cleaned their plates.

Cozy. Charming. Comfortable. The three words that spring to mind when I think of our experience at Coronado Cafe last night.  We were a party of four, which is probably close to the largest party I would like to have there due to the intimacy of the space.   The converted house is quaint and elegant, but doesn't feel pretentious or fancy. The food was excellent, and the service was (mostly) good. The only dock comes from having to repeatedly ask to fill our tiny water glasses.   I had the vegetable rellenos with added flank steak, and my first thought when I took a bite was "Oooh, I'm already looking forward to leftovers tomorrow for lunch!" and then I proceeded to eat the entire thing. Darn.  I can't speak for my fellow diners, but everyone else's meals looked fabulous.  I had creme brulee for dessert, which was not the best I've ever had. The other desserts on the table, brownie sundae and caribbean bread pudding, looked divine.  This is a gem among the gems of 7th street, and I will definitely go again.

I finally went to Lux when Pane Bianco was serving lunch (usually I'm there too early), and it has opened up a whole new avenue for me to whittle away at my checking account. You'd think it would get boring after awhile with only 3 menu items, but no, I can still find something to plunk down $10 for, dangling participles be darned.  And I'm a sucker for any kind of artisan home-made pickle product, such as their 32-oz jar of specialty pickles for the low, low price of $12. Yes, I paid twelve dollars for pickles. Don't tell my husband. They are fabulous, as promised by the girl behind the counter.  So far I've had the sopressata and the mozzarella, and both were delightful. The staff is very friendly and efficient.   I love that they have art on the walls going down into the back area...as if they not only want the customers to enjoy their few moments there but also care about providing a culturally present environment for the employees.

What?? No raw salmon? Only smoked?I am tres cornfused. Am I at a bagel place or a sushi restaurant?  Slow service. Limited sushi menu. Bland Miso.  NO RAW SALMON.  Enough said, I won't be back. Too bad it was my only Saturday sushi lunch option (Zen 32, I'm looking in your direction...).

So, I always leave Giuseppe's stuffed full of rich Italian goodness, but my wallet sure suffers. The reason we don't frequent this neighborhood dive i because you get so little for such a high price. The food is high quality. The portions are tiny. The menu item that annoys me the most is the ravioli...you get about 6 little raviolis and are expected to make a meal of it.   And I heard a rumor that they're raising their prices because they were just featured on the Food Network.   How do you say "Sellout" in Italian?

Couldn't muster the energy to make myself dinner, so I gyroed it up. The gyro is still very good (the pita bread is perfect), and I also got hummus and dolmas. The hummus is fine, but the dolmas were the sleeper hit of the evening. I've always been kind of iffy on dolmas and have only recently started trying them at different restaurants, and these ones are high on my list. They have a perfect leaf:rice ratio (I hate having too much gummy rice to knock back) and there was a very lively tang to the dressing.   And kudos to Steve, the owner, for keeping up with the Yelp reviews. Good to know a business owner cares what his customers think.

I got takeout here today and was not disappointed. The soup of the day was Mushroom Brie Bisque...I mean, how could you go wrong with those ingredients?? It was  everything I hoped for: creamy, savory, luscious, yummy. I wish I'd gotten a bowl instead of a cup.   I also got an order of dolmades. Usually dolmades are cold and often very dense and "rice-y," which can be a turn-off for me. These were warm and almost saucy inside, and served with a warm tangy lemon-cream sauce. Delicious.  And there was plenty of warm oiled pita bread, nice and moist to sop the dolmades sauce up.  I'll definitely be back!

I am embarrassed to admit that tonight was my first time here, even though I've lived within walking distance for 5 years, because I assumed it would not be good. WRONG. Why is this place not more of a yelp gem?  (Actually, one reason I've never pursued it is because I think at one point the reviews were mixed up between this place the the place on McDowell. This review is for the restaurant on the NW corner of 24th St and Indian School.)  It was totally empty at 6pm on Saturday when I stopped in to get takeout. The woman helping me was very polite and helped me pick out a few things from the Chinese menu.   The Singapore noodles were scrumptious and I ate the whole order by myself.  The green beans with XO sauce were also tasty, although plan to use those more as a side than an entree (and as a heads up, I do not think they are vegetarian, though one might assume them to be; I think there is some diced dried fish in the sauce making it YUMMY but not veggie).  The soup of the day was described as "rehydrated bok Choi soup". I'm not sure what that means, exactly, since when is bok choi DEhydrated anyway? I don't think she thought I'd like it because it was more of a traditional Chinese soup, but I loved it. It was very brothy with ultra-boiled greens, some unfamiliar mushroom or possibly dried plum thing, and (I think) boiled peanuts. The broth had a slightly sweet quality to it, similar to Pho broth. I'm not making the soup sound that good, but it was. Just try it.   I had heard that the winter melon soup is great, but the woman told me that while occasionally they have it as a daily soup, usually you have to call a couple of days in advance to order it so they can prepare.  I'm so glad I finally found a good neighborhood Chinese restaurant.

We have tried twice to eat here, and twice it has been closed. Yet every time I drive by it, the parking lot is packed. What restaurant doesn't serve dinner on Saturdays?

So we finally ate here. The decor has not been updated since about 1967, and we were surrounded by overweight senior citizens reeking of cigarette smoke. The food was reminiscent of middle school cafeteria fare.   The waitresses were very friendly, and the prices were not bad. We were obviously not the target demographic, though. Won't be back. Too bad, because we can walk there...

5 stars for customer service. This is our go-to place for Chinese take-out after having tried a bunch of places in our area. The food is consistent, standard Chinese-American, always hot, with fresh veggies.   Tonight, though, I was prompted to write a review. I am vegetarian and my husband is a little picky, and as such I made asked for some substitutions to our order. I ordered Mooshoo vegetable with no egg (my preferece) and veggie fried rice with added tofu and no mushrooms (hubbie's preference after finding a rogue mushroom last time). Also ordered a few other items.  5 minutes later, China Village called back to double-check that I also didn't want egg in the fried rice since I had asked for it in the mooshoo. I thanked him for asking, and no, we did not want any egg in the rice.   I went to pick up the order, and the sweet little lady at the counter told me that that also made sure to take the mushrooms out of our soup, since she was worried that we couldn't eat mushrooms and didn't want us to worry about finding them.   They did not have to pay such close attention to details, and I wouldn't have complained if none of these things had occurred. But because they went the extra mile, my appreciation was far greater than my dissatisfaction would have been.   Support this place and show them that customer service still means something!

Alan did a beautiful job with two pieces I brought to him. It's my first framing experience in Phoenix, but I have no reason to shop around. Plus, he has very cool art installations in his lobby that make me wish, for the millionth time, that I had a couple thousand bucks lying around to spend on arte.

Great little place. A previous review says it's not luxurious, but what they meant I think is that it's not huge and spendy like other places around. It is a sweet, calm, quiet place and Traci got right down to business during my massage. Highly recommended.

Solid Pho and spring rolls at the usual low low price. I stopped in yesterday for takeout and got beef pho with meatballs, spring rolls, and a Thai iced tea all for about $11. The Pho came with the usual toppings, all very fresh and plentiful. The spring rolls were big and packed with noodles, shrimp, and beef. My only complaint was that the iced tea was so sweet I'm pretty sure all of my teeth started to rot right there; I couldn't finish it. But I think that's just a personal preference.   No complaints about the food or price, and the staff was friendly. Clean enough place, I would eat there.

Went to TK specifically to try the pistachio ice cream. They were out. Then I asked what other dessert I could try instead (read: I want to spend money in your establishment), I was told I could only get dessert if I ordered other food as well.   And they promptly lost a potential customer for this inane rule.

I've been here once, and I will only go here once. I met my husband and some friends there after work sometime in February, when it was still cold enough at night to require jackets and outdoor heaters to sit outside. We were seated in a dark corner of the patio, where there were THREE portable heaters, none of which were turned on. We asked our ditzy, busty, DUMB waitress FOUR TIMES to turn them on, and she kept saying, "I'll have to ask someone to do it. I don't know how."  I finally asked her WHO she had to ask, and she pointed to the dirty looking guys acting as bouncers at the gate, who apparently are the only ones in the joint authorized to turn on the heat lamps. Fine. I walked over to them and asked if we could get our heaters turned on, and the guy walked right over and did it for us. Took all of 30 seconds.   Oh, and it took about 45 minutes for our food to arrive, and when it did, several of the orders were messed up. And the waitress didn't care. And it wasn't that good.   Can you tell I didn't really care for this place (note my frequent use of all-caps)? And yet it will continue on, because college students will continue to buy their beer and flaccid fries as long as ASU is there.  Ah well. We can't all have as refined taste as I.  OK, as long as I'm in pretentious snob mode, I'd like to point out that one of the reviews of this establishment excuses the small oyster portions because "we're in a dessert." Um...stripper jumping out of a cake? Or do you really not know how to spell DESERT?  Yowza. I'm usually nicer.

Have you seen the Onion video on YouTube about the new keyboard-less Mac laptop where the guy being interviewed says "I'll buy almost anything if it's shiny and made by Apple?" Yeah, that pretty much sums up the Lux clientele. But don't get me wrong, I love me some Lux.   Soy latte with a blob of whipped cream and fun patterns in the foam? Love it. Velvet latte with a blob of whipped cream and fun patterns in the foam? Love it. Croissant bread pudding with a blob of whipped cream to spoon into the fun patterns in the foam? Love it.  People watching, alterna-hip vibing, Macbook-ing...Lux is the place to be for yummy fancy coffee and surrounding yourself with people who wonder, "Are you genuine?" (I was glad to see they finally changed that little message)  Here's a fun game my husband and I played the first time we went there (on a chilly chilly day): watch all the people coming in the door that doesn't automatically close behind them, and try to guess which ones are conscientious and take a second to close it firmly. It's about 70:30 in favor of the assholes. We sat there with our Macs and our indie-band TShirts and smugged it up in the knowledge that we are so much better than, well, everyone.  More fun games to play at Lux:  1)count the Obama bumper stickers on the cars in the lot 2)count the Prius's (Prii?) (OK, one is mine) 3)count the Macs 4)count the non-Macs, then point and laugh at him 5)count the hair colors Oh, it goes on. But I kid. I go there every time I have a day off.

Maybe we caught them on an off night. I was not impressed. We were choosing between Red Devil and Mamma Mia's, and Mamma Mia's delivers, so it won. We should have driven, but being new in the neighborhood, we didn't know better.  Pros:  1)the delivery guy was prompt and friendly.  2) the chicken wings were tasty.  Cons:  1)The Veggie pizza has gobs of thawed, previously frozen chopped spinach. You know, the kind that comes in a frozen block at the grocery store that you're supposed to wring out before you use it. 2)The crust was beyond soggy...it was downright WET. Probably from the aforementioned icky spinach. 3)The wings come with a packet of blue cheese salad dressing, the kind you pick out of a basket at cafeteria salad bars. And it was really thin and watery. At least it matched the pizza...  There are too many decent pizza places to risk this place again.

OK, we went to the "new" Asi Es La Vida last night after watching all of the sign changes and "now open" signs come and go over the last several months. Here's the scoop: the original owners sold it in June and it became La Taz de Oro or something like that for about 3 months, then those owners left and the original owners took it back. They were in Mexico in the fall and were delayed getting back to reopen Asi Es La Vida, plus they had to go through inspection processes all over again, so they didn't open until November, and here we are. And it is exactly the same as the last time I went! All that change, and nothing changed. Kind of funny.  I have one complaint. Before we went, I looked up their menu online and saw that it had changed dramatically from the last time we were there. I remembered fancy Mexican food with a high price tag, and the menu online boasts your more low-brow enchiladas and tacos fare for much lower prices. I thought, cool, a new neighborhood Tex-Mex joint that won't break the bank. But the menu is EXACTLY the same as before all of the changing of hands, the only change being that they brought all of the prices down about $2. So I don't get the online menu and they should definitely update that.   Anyway, the food is very good, as usual. High end Mexican. Still no chips or bread to start. And the weird TV-Dinner rice is still on the plate...they must have just called their old distributors when they reopened.   We shared the queso fundido with chorizo, which comes with corn tortillas and a variety of salsas. Excellente and spicy. Then I had a bowl of Crema de Cilantro, which was rich and creamy and almost smoky...would love to recreate at home. Entrees: I had a combo of mole and ropa vieja. The ropa was a tad on the salty side, which I like but others might not. The mole was superb. Hubby had a steak filet with chipotle sauce...he said it was excellent.  The service, as usual, was impeccable...they strive to make their customers feel like they are dining at the Ritz.   Oh, and now it is BYOB, so that's new.

I went to Matt's the other morning for a solo breakfast before work. I was treating myself because I'd been on a gluten-free diet for over a month and that was the day I was reintroducing wheat after getting some blood drawn, and I'd been literally dreaming about waffles for weeks.   Diet aside, it was such a nice, cheerful way to start my day. I'd been to Matt's before for a Sunday brunch, and we waited forever outside in the heat. This was totally different: I walked in and sat down at the counter, no wait at all, and the waitstaff is very attentive and quick. I found myself smiling out at downtown Phoenix through that big picture window before my beloved waffles had even graced my place setting.   Waffles: solid. Belgian. Bacon: thick-cut and peppered. I could have eaten 5 more slices. Homefries: this is what I remember as being so stand-out from my first visit, and they did not disappoint the second time. Crispy, tasty potato chunks with caramelized onions and sauteed bits of rosemary...oh yum. And they're not even made of wheat.  Thanks, Matt, for giving me a lovely mid-week breakfast experience.

One star from a vegan perspective. This is a great restaurant if you love meat and cheese. You can even get away with being vegetarian here if you like lots and lots of cheese. But when I asked the waitress if there was anything on the menu that could be made without cheese, she looked at me like I was retarded and said, "You really should just order a salad."  I knew what I was getting into when we came here, so I was prepared to eat something doused in cheese, but I bet other restaurants/chefs would have at least tried to accommodate a request like that. I even asked if the chili relleno could be stuffed with the beans/rice side dish instead of cheese, and the waitress said no (the beans are made with pork broth anyway, so it was a moot point).   Oh well. It is very rich and tasty food, but if you are strict vegan and you come here with a group (which would be the only reason a vegan would even walk in the door), eat at home or plan to stop at Green afterwards.

So disappointing. After fantasizing about a Friday night dinner out ALL DAY, we decided to try this local dive. We had previously been to Rosita's place down the street and wondered how two Mexican restaurants could compete so close to each other.   Well, I'm still wondring. Rosita's Place was excellent. La Barquita was so mediocre that I spent the entire next day fantasizing about where to go out on Saturday to quell my unsated desire to have a good meal at a restaurant.  We got there at 8 on Friday. Hours are listed as open until 9. We were the ONLY people in the place other than the lone waitress, one cook, and two old dudes playing guitar. They approached us at one point and asked us if we wanted a song (man, I HATE that--but no big deal, it's a dive.), and we politely declined.    No one greeted us when we walked in, I had to go back to the kitchen to see if they were really open.  The waitress was very friendly and service was prompt, once we were noticed.   We ordered the posole, queso fundido with chorizo, 3 sopes with steak, and a chicken burro with red sauce.   It was all *okay*, nothing to write home about.   The queso was literally a dish of broiled cheese with crumbled chorizo, which, as soon as it came out of the oven, started to congeal and we actually had to cut it with a knife.  I had to ask for more salsa because the shot-glass portion that came with our chips was gone in uno minuto. It was tasty salsa, though.  About halfway through our meal, the waitress started mopping the floor of the restaurant with very potent disinfectant. I could practically taste it, and she was actually mopping around our feet! Nothing says "hurry up and get out" like the scent of bleach in your food...  She followed us to the door after we paid and, as I predicted, locked that sucker the second we stepped out. 8:30pm.   Well, now I don't have to wonder about this place and I can keep going to Rosita's...

We were gifted a Groupon for Fuego and had the pleasure of dining there on Friday night. We did not have a reservation, which would have helped us sit outside, but we were seated inside right away. The host was very pleasant and welcoming.   Much has already been praised about this little gem, and I agree with all of the accolades regarding the atmosphere, the service, the food...it was all wonderful.   We had the Fuego salad, which was huge and lovely (although I would have liked some diced onions on it; maybe I'll ask next time), the tortilla soup (husband raved about this), the Pulled Pork with cheddar chipotle mashed potatoes and maple-glazed carrots, and the panko-breaded chicken breast with creamed jalapeno corn and maple-glazed carrots.   In all it was delectable. The entrees were succulent and nicely plated. I particularly loved the creamed corn, which was perfectly spicy and helped clear by sinuses (I succumbed to a bad cold the next day, so maybe I need some more!).  The only thing I would not order again is the carrots. I didn't feel these added anything to our dinners. The maple taste was pretty subtle, to the point of being nonexistent. Also, I think that if you're going to put yourself out there as an upscale restaurant, go the extra mile and use real carrots instead of the bagged "baby carrots" that you can find so readily on cafeteria lines. It will look better.   Our waiter forgot to charge us for the soup. I pointed this out, and he comped us anyway. I will definitely continue to patronize an establishment that empowers its staff to make decisions like that without worrying that they're going to get a dock in pay.  We'll be back, probably first to try out the amazing-looking Happy Hour!

Excellent Pho, huge portion with lots of fresh sprouts, basil cilantro, limes, scallions, and meet. I got the rare beef and meatball version. The broth was quite flavorful. I also got a chicken sandwich which I'd never gotten at a Vietnamese place before, and it was awesome! Packed with flavor and toppings, and the bread was nice and crusty/soft.   Lost a star for being pretty dirty. I didn't really want to touch anything. I would not eat there.

You get what you pay for, and at Simply Bread, it's worth the price. I recommend the challah and the fabulous macaroons. I bought a macaroon on a whim one morning after hiking at South Mountain and almost turned the car around to buy 100 more when I bit into it on the way home.  My only saving grace (for my wallet and my waist) is that I'm always at work during their business hours.

Great experience. They were able to come out within a day of my phone call, right on time, and the problem was fixed on the spot for a very reasonable price. $140 to change out both leaky shower valves in the bathroom. Sure, I could have done it myself, but I know it would have taken me forever to get around to it and it would have been a big pain for me. So I was happy to pay someone else who could do it in 30 minutes while I baked a birthday cake for my kid.

Stopped in today for a pedicure. They got me in pretty quickly, offered me coffee while I waited, and I enjoyed reading a magazine in their very calming, bright, modern waiting area. Loved the music and the little courtyard and the sleek interior design.  Got  great pedicure and would not hesitate to go back.  Plus you can get lunch at Two Hippies across the street, so what's not to love?

This was a very mediocre experience for us, and I'm more than a little annoyed that I wasted a good Friday night dinner out here.   This place gets one star for the bread starter: that stuff was awesome and we plowed through two baskets. I could have sucked down that whole bowl of peppers in oil.   Another star for portion size...as opposed to stingy Giuseppe's, you actually get a full plate of food for your seventeen bucks.   Reasons we won't be back: 1)We got seated right away, our waiter brought us water, menu, bread, and then we watched him say goodbye to Joe and WALK OUT THE DOOR. Shift over? Who knows. We waited for a good 15-20 minutes, with now-empty water glasses and bread basket, while NO ONE came to our table and Joe and his family were schmoozing around the room. We finally flagged down a busboy and he got a waitress for us. No apology, no nothing. We also overheard the table next to us complain about having to wait a long time for their appetizers (different waitress!).  2)The food was really bland and nothing special at all. I got the raved-about spaghetti and meatballs, and all I could think was how I was spending all this money on pasta from a box topped with sauce from a can. Bland, Bland, Bland. And the meatballs: yes, they were huge, but my husband's comment when he tried a bite summed it up well: "mmmmmm Liquid Meat." The meatballs have the texture (and almost the taste) of Grandma's fluffy matzoh balls, which is great if you're eating matzoh balls but just plain weird if you're eating meat. Meat is not supposed to be fluffy.   Too many great  restaurants to try for us to frequent this one again. Subpar food, bad service...no thanks.

We went to Breadfruit last night for a Saturday dinner. When we got there, there were two other couples on the place, but it filled up while we were eating (which means two other parties sat down...the place is lovely and tiny).   Our waiter (owner? not sure) was extremely enthusiastic about the menu and the special appetizer of the day, which was jerk scallops. He REALLY wanted us to order them. Well fine, I love scallops, so why not. And they were excellent! My only complaint: there were two scallops and they cost more than each of our meals! Had I known that ahead of time (and no I didn't ask), I wouldn't have ordered them. But it's a small complaint.  The food: everything was very tasty. I ordered the brown chicken stew and DH ordered the jerk chicken, and he even liked the mango salsa that came with it (he usually scrapes all strange and exotic food items to the side of his plate).   We also had the avocado plantain rolls for appetizers, and they were great. The special drinks are also quite delicious.  The place is clean bright, and fun. I would definitely go again to sample some other menu items.

Excellent experience all around. I can't add much that hasn't already been said, except to point out that when I asked for a substitution in my meal, the waiter didn't even blink and it was prepared just like I asked. Many restaurants won't be flexible in the kitchen.   I ordered the Med plate as my meal, and it was definitely more than enough! Every part of it was delicious, including the sauteed mushrooms I asked for as a replacement for feta (no cheese for me). My husband couldn't stop talking about his pizza, and he devoured the whole thing, which was unusual for him.   I will gladly give this restaurant 5 stars if we go back and the wonderful experience proves repeatable.

Well, anyplace that gives me reason to shovel food into my face until I feel like I'm going to explode is worthy of 5 stars.   Brisket: nice mix of fatty/crispy. Ribs: Hubby-approved. Smoked chicken: moist, meaty, rich. Fried okra: Oh, YUM. Loved the crunchy cornbread coating. And the fact that it turned the paper bag transparent on the drive home...that just means it's good for me, right? Mac/Cheese: Never would have thought to slather the stuff in butter, but boy oh boy that made it yummy.  Greens: nice and salty.  Not too expensive for a BBQ place...looking forward to trying the rest of the menu. I'm so glad I tried this place!

What a smokin' hot deal! We went to Maizie's for the first time last night for $3 burger night. The place was jam packed; obviously I have been woefully ignorant of the city's best-kept secret meal-deal for the past 2-odd years I've been living here...  We were there around 6:30 and had about a 15-20 minute wait. The benches outside are cute and comfy and there's a huge planter full of fresh herbs that absolutely tantalizes you with its perfume.  We both ordered the Bistro Burger with cheese and fries, and also an order of chips and salsa. OK, the price of the chips and salsa was steep ($6) but it was damn good salsa, so I won't complain! The burgers were excellent! So were the fries!   The food quality certainly does not suffer despite the mad rush to make it for the screaming fans. We have been to Delux, Stax, and Maizie's all in the past week, and Maizie's is winning in my burger book. They are ample, juicy, and perfectly seasoned (and mighty tasty topped with salsa). Plus, $3 DOLLARS!!! Holy Cripes!  Our entire, belly-stuffing, mouth-watering meal for two came to $15. We did not order drinks, thought, so that would definitely bring it up.  Lost a star for the harried waitstaff, who, while courteous, seemed like they all wanted to crawl into a hole and cry rather than work Monday at Maizie's. I wonder if they fight over who has to do it?  Now I'm torn between going there only on Mondays for the burger deal or trying it on another night to experience a less frenzied atmosphere.   So much to eat, so little time...

Tried Bombay Spice last night. After reading the website and reviews, it seemed like it would fit perfectly our combined need to finally find good Indian fare in Phoenix AND not blow our calorie budget (husband and I are trying--and succeeding!-- in losing weight). Success on both counts!  It was Saturday at about 6:30 and we were seated immediately. The place was almost full. We sat on the patio, which was lovely, but might get too hot during the summer (I didn't see any misters--You're Welcome, Mother Earth!).    Service was attentive, and our waitress gave us several recommendations.   We ordered: Somosas (baked, I think, not fried, which made them a little messier to eat but still very very tasty). Naan (chewy, moist, naan-y...yum) Grilled Shrimp skewers (a little on the skimpy side, but very tasty, and served with grilled peppers and onions and a delightful mint sauce).  We each ordered individual entrees with basmati. They encourage you to order the two-entree choice, but we were trying to avoid over-ordering, and it turned out to be exactly the right amount of food.   I ordered the Cauliflower and potatoes, which was moist, savory, a little spicy, and very tasty, albeit lacking a little in the sauce department (I would have liked a little something to spoon over my rice).  Husband ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, which was exceptional. They claim that they don't use cream in their food, so I don't know how they made the masala sauce so creamy and good, but they did and I'm not going to question it any more! I would have licked the bowl if we had been at home.   Next time I think we'll get some apps again but try the Bombay Plate to share, which is 5 entree choices and rice. That way we can try a whole bunch of things.   $35 before tip for naan, two appetizers, and two single-choice entrees. Not bad for a Saturday out. We'll definitely be back, even though it was  kind of a drive for us.

We used to live at 90th and Shea, a mere stone's throw from Sweet Republic. Then we moved to CenPho, and I have yet to find anything around here that compares. Gelato Spot? Nope. Too much commercial hype.   I have been known to call ahead and  make sure SR has Mango Lassi before making the trek...

We were in North S-Dale last night for a poker game and lost on purpose so we could get to SR before it closed. Still great, still wish it weren't so far from me.  I got a scoop of Mojito and a scoop of the ever-popular basil-lime. They were great together, the mojito is very minty and sweet. The Basil lime will kick you in the pants. Interesting how we always think of basil as a savory taste, but works so well in this sweet treat.   Yum. Too bad it's not in a strip mall that has more going on so they could get more business. This would be a terrific place for a little indie movie theater...

I know I am late to the noca party...I am so glad I finally got to go! We had a terrific experience here on Christmas Eve. We wanted someplace special (Read, expensive!) and I have heard so many great things about this place, it seemed the right time to splurge.   We had 6pm reservations. When we arrived, the restaurant was about 50% full. It got packed as we ate, though, so the 7pm reservations must be hard to come by.   The service was fantastic. We had a very attentive yet unobtrusive waitress. The best part of the service was when I looked over at the table next to me, who had been seated after us, and I noticed their food coming out when we had yet to see anything but the fun little amuse bouche. The snarkiness was barely forming in my mind when our server leaned in and said, "I am so sorry for the wait. The kitchen misplaced your ticket. Dinner is on the house tonight. Merry Christmas!" I hadn't even had time to complain yet and she had already noticed the problem, inquired about it, and fixed it. I was very impressed (and thrilled to eat at noca for FREE!!!).   On to the food:  Apps:   The clam chowder ($10) was fantabulous. It was rich, creamy, and laced with wine or sherry, and the clams were so tender and sweet; not like the typical rubbery bites you find in most chowders.   The polenta ($14) with bolognese was out of this world. The polenta was crisp on the outside and luxuriously creamy on the inside with flecks of fresh rosemary. The bolognese was rich and decadent, just like it should be.   Entrees:  I had the spinach linguine ($22) with assorted seafood. I was hooked by the boast of fresh pasta...usually I skip the pasta section when I go out to eat because I can make it just as well at home, but I am a sucker for fresh and this was no disappointment! It was a generous portion (not huge, but adequate) with large pieces of halibut, scallop, and probably some other white fish. The sauce was a delicate garlic cream sauce that barely coated the noodles; it was a nice change from the typical heavy, soupy cream sauces you typically get.   Husband had the pork osso bucco ($19 maybe?) , which he said was excellent. It looked beautiful; I didn't try any.   Of course we devoured the cotton candy; that was actually the main reason I had wanted to try noca. I loooove cotton candy, and it is such a fun touch.   We ordered dessert ($9), which was possibly the best part of the whole meal. It was a tart, heavenly passionfruit cream smothering an almond dacquoise, sprinkled with sheets of mereingue and topped with a scoop of coconut sorbet. I was actually pretty close to licking the bowl, manners be damned.   There have been complaints about portion size...know before you go, this is no Applebees. You are not going there to stuff your face with greasy fried. You are going there for a sophisticated culinary experience, part of which is the beauty of the presentation.  I had expected to plunk down at least $100 for this meal. While I was super excited to have them comp it, I would have gladly paid for it. And it wasn't terribly expensive, because we didn't order drinks.  I think that's where noca gets the pricey reputation, because you can easily spend more on alcohol than on the entire meal.   We can't wait to go back! Thanks, noca, for making our Christmas Eve dinner an outstanding experience.

So I've been driving by this parking lot every day on my way home from work since we moved into our house in the fall, and I always think to myself, I've got to stop there and get a hot dog. If it comes from a cart powered by a van with the street address painted on the side, it's GOT to be good, right?  Well it is good, and my wait is finally over. I got a hot dog to go tonight, with the works: pinto beans, onions, tomatoes, mayo, parmesan cheese, jalapeno salsa, cheddar cheese...my only complaint is that my mouth is not big enough to fit every tasty morsel in at once. But I guess that's my problem, not theirs.  My hot dog was not wrapped in bacon...I wonder if they've succumbed to the pressures of healthy eating? Hmm.

Found this today while cruising down 7th on my way to Roosevelt Row for some belated Christmas shopping. Very cute interior. I got the Torta, which was huge and extremely tasty with moist, seasoned asada, guac, veggies, and jalapenos on a soft buttery bread. Mmm!

I want to live here. Do you think they'd mind if I just sacked out on their couch? The atmosphere is so intimate and welcoming, I almost feel like they would be fine with it.  We went here for my birthday, and I fell in love. The decor, the food, the bathrooms...I loved every detail. We were warned by the waiter that the portions are huge, but apparently he has never seen me eat before because we cleaned our plates.   We started with the mac and cheese (cheesy, gooey, creamy heaven in noodle form), the medjool dates with brie and chorizo (smokysweetspicy little bites of sin), the roasted garlic with crostini (OK, there's not much you can do to elevated this one from other restaurants, but it was devoured) and wine.   For dinner, we shared the citrus-brined fried chicken with greens and cheddar waffles. Oh my goodness. That was some damn good chicken, Colonel.  The only complaint I had was that I was so stuffed from dinner that I couldn't even fathom the thought of dessert, a rarity for me.   Can't wait to go back.

Not sure what I can add to the already rave reviews...  I've been here twice in the past week for lunch, and both times were fabulous. OK, the service was a touch slow the first time, but no big deal.   The cheese plate was beautiful and tasty: three handpicked cheeses (we had a lovely goat, a hard cheddar, and a brie), some baguette slices, dried fruits, nuts, and marmalade. Loverly.   The bowl of olives is very good, about what you would expect for a bowl of gourmet olives. The olives at TMI are waaaay better because they are marinated in sinful lusciousness, but I digress.  I had the "pick two" option with a cup (bowl? the thing was huge) of potato cheddar soup and half of a tuna salad sandwich on ciabatta. My parents had sandwich/salad combos that looked awesome. I particularly like the portion sizes (large) and the fact that you can pick from any of the salads rather than being forced to eat some bland "side" salad or Caesar like at other places with this option.  Didn't get any wine, but the selection looks great.  Today I had the soup again and the Autostrada sandwich, which did not disappoint. And it was the most perfect weather to sit out back on the patio.   This is why we live in AZ! I will definitely be back, and can't wait to try the (closer) Campbell location.

I can't decide if I'm excited or filled with dread that a new Pinkberry knockoff has opened up not even 2 miles from my house.   (Interesting side note...when I typed Pinkberry up there, I accidentally hit the o and typed Oinkberry...methinks this has a deeper meaning...)  The goods: the yogurt is creamy, tasty, and has lots of varieties, although I have yet to stray from my favorites, tart original and pomegranate. Hubby says the chocolate is the best he's ever tasted. The toppings are the standard fare for the Fro-Yo movement, including plain mochi, which is the only reason I go. The interior design is very hip, very red, very much a purposeful image.  The bads: if you go at a busy time, the yogurt gets really soft and goopy because people don't know to put the handles back into the off position. Maybe we need a sign? And of course, it's expensive. I never get out of there for less than $5. Hence the aforementioned dread.  And last, but not least, am I the only one who thinks they should be pronounced "Mo-yo?" As in, a clever twist on the product's nickname? The local high school Sassy Magazine wannabes behind the counter looked at me like I was some crazy old lady for even suggesting it.   OK, I was wearing my candy-cane pajama pants and a mustard-stained T-Shirt, but still...

Tried LB for dinner tonight, and it did not disappoint. We arrive around 8:30 (Friday) and it was pleasantly busy but we were seated right away. It's so relaxing to sit out on their patio, even on a hot night it's comfortable.   Service was prompt and courteous, we got water and menus right away.   We ordered: 1/2 shrimp and pesto lahvosh (oh my goodness, I could have inhaled that entire gigantic platter and had to practically force husband's half on him so I wouldn't steal it from him). This was the hit of the meal, and 1/2 order was huge. Perfect to split between two people as a starter. I will be tasting garlic for days and waxing nostalgic for that crispy bit of goodness.  Husband had the BBQ-bacon burger with fries, and he wiped his plate clean. I guess it was good.   I ordered the Veggie Sandwich with green salad. I violated my sandwiches-aren't-for-dinner rule because I wasn't in the mood for anything heavy or creamy or cheesy as an entree. It was a great choice, with greens, cucumber, roasted red pepper, hummus, and olive tapenade mixed with a vinaigrette and served on a herbed focaccia. The salad was large, and the lime vinaigrette suggested by the server was superb.   Reasonable prices, but not cheap. Before tip, without drinks, our total was $33.   I would like to see some lighter, non-sandwich entrees added to the menu, maybe some more vegetarian or shrimp dishes that don't also rely on cream sauces and cheese and pasta. Just a suggestion from someone who is really trying to avoid gorging at restaurants, but who still wants fabulous food. I don't always want to stick to the salad menu when I go out for dinner.   But a very nice night for a dinner out, and we were both happily full when we left.

And Ann Taylor sundress for $16? I'm sold. Or rather, the dress is, as it is now hanging in my closet, mocking all of the other AT items that I paid a ridiculous amount for.

Finally tried this place after being thwarted last week by an emergency that had them closed on a weekday. Glad everything seems in order again.  The good reviews don't lie...this is a diamond in the rough. The food was excellent and the two lovely ladies behind the counter were gracious and generous with the samples. I ordered the chocolate stew/chicken adobo/garlic rice combo ($5.99) and hubby got the pork adobo burrito ($6.25). Ample food for a great price! We also got an order of lumpia, of which I ate  9 out of 10 before my husband even realized what was happening. I also swiped his mango salsa and ate that whole container almost in one bite.  All of the food was excellent. I have docked one star only because the meat sauces are a little on the oily side; if they could knock the oil down a notch it would be 5 stars for sure.  I couldn't resist grabbing a piece of cassava cake to go...it was the sleeper hit of the meal and I wish I had another piece right now! I can only describe it as the Filipino answer to noodle kugel; coconutty, custardy, sweet, but not too sweet. So GOOD.   We will definitely be back. Yum.

This is my favorite Indian restaurant in CenPho. They are very helpful when I ask for recommendations without meat or dairy. The prices are absurdly cheap. I also enjoy shopping for pantry items while I'm waiting for my order. Keyword vegan for those of you searching.

This hit the spot after a disappointing dinner out the night before at La Barquita.   Logic would say that if you have a bad experience at a restaurant you've never been to and want to have a better experience the next night, you should probably go somewhere you trust, like Maizie's, Tuck Shop, Cheuvronts, etc. But I'd been eyeing Hula for a while and we decided to be adventurous.  Decor: love it. Modern, vaguely Tiki/beachy, but mostly contemporary Phoenix with the ever-popular garage-doors that can open up the dining room on a warm night. Very cool patio with fire pit.  Service: attentive and prompt. Our waiter agreed with my asessment of the Cajun Burger (but didn't adjust our bill like I was secretly hoping...boo!)  Food: Just what I was craving. Big portions, nice and savory, great selection. I had the ceviche appetizer, and I could have licked the plate. I loved the subtle coconut flavor of the fish, and the crispy tortillas was a nice touch.   I ordered the Cajun burger and Hubby ordered the Hula burger. Now, here's where I wish I could down-grade to 3.5 stars (but I'm feeling generous today): My cajun burger was completely indistiguishable from the hula burger. I could absolutely not tell that there were any additional spices or sauce on my burger, and yet I paid an additional dollar. When I told the server I thought I had gotten a hula burger by accident, he actually said, "No, it's a Cajun burger, you just can't tate the difference. I've been telling the kitchen staff that forever but they don't believe me." ?????  So, I didn't complain because it had been a good dinner and the burger was delicious as it was, but seriously, save yourself a dollar and just order the hula burger.   Note to the kitchen: your waiter is right. You guys are Cajun-wimps! Either slather that sucker in some spicy sauce, or fess up and admit to upcharging for your Hula burger!  Overall a very good dinner, and I will be back.

Solid. Consistent.   Hubby got the Hula burger again and was practically moaning with pleasure throughout the entire meal.   Ceviche was good AGAIN.   I got the Ahi burger this time, and it was scrumptious: Perfectly seasoned and a little spicy, I will definitely be getting this one again.

Love this little place. Alicia has cut my hair three times now, and does a fantastic job. She takes her time and really pays close attention to every hair! I have a super short pixie cut, so it could definitely be done badly, but I have been very satisfied every time I've gotten a trim here. The price is pretty average for  most salons I've been to.

Yesterday, while Alicia was rescuing the disaster I had allowed my hair to become since my last cut too long ago, I had the opportunity to observe Ambur styling her client's hair in the chair next to me.   The girl was probably 13-ish and had naturally curly hair, and Ambur had colored it, cut bangs, and blown it out straight. It looked super cute, but the girl was obviously freaked out about the change. Ambur was very sensitive to this and calmly and cheerfully led her back to the sink to wash the curl back into her hair and restyle it.   The poor girl was clearly embarassed about making her start over and kept apologizing, but Ambur was just casual and encouraging the whole time. I feel that some stylists would have taken offense at having to redo everything, or would have tried to convince the client that it looked good, but she was more concerned that the girl was comfortable with the look and was giving her little style tips about how to manage her new bangs.   The girl looked adorable with both styles, and I'm sure will be the hit of her class at the first day of school, and I think Ambur gave her a nudge of confidence by being so cool the whole time. What a great role model!  (And my haircut was great, as usual.)

I finally got around to visiting the MIM today with my daughter. All of the glowing reviews of the building, the exhibits, the vastness are true. I take no issue with the content of the museum  I was really enjoying our visit until we got to the end of it and started inquiring about membership, as it seemed like it would be practical to put our rather hefty ticket prices toward joining as a family.   I have memberships at the Phoenix Art Museum ($90 for a family, with unlimited visits and other perks), the Science Center ($115/family), the Heard ($75/Family) and SMOCA (don't have the number handy, but it's on par with the others) and was expecting the MIM to have something in those ranges.   Instead they offered me a $250 "donation" package that could buy either unlimited visits for 2 people (I have a family of four) or 10 tickets to be used during the year, with virtually no other benefits such as discounted concert tickets.   My enthusiasm for the museum continued to decline as I looked more into the money side of things, for example: --They do not offer discounted or free admission at any point, unlike many city museums  --There is no participation in the library Culture Pass program, which would at least make the museum accessible for a few families who can't otherwise afford to go --No reciprocity with other museums if you buy a membership --There are no afternoon concerts, virtually eliminating the involvement of young children and their parents in the live music opportunities there (nevermind the added cost of a babysitter if parents want to go out) --Its location requires travel by car or (I imagine) a pretty long bus ride, with no contribution to the walking/public transportation culture that Phoenix is trying to cultivate  In short, the MIM might as well hang a sign outside that says "NO POOR PEOPLE ALLOWED" because they are actively discouraging the attendance of a large percentage of its home city.   I wonder if the indigenous people and the music educators and pioneers featured in the exhibits, without whom the museum would not exist, could afford to buy tickets or memberships to the museum that claims to champion their contributions to history?  I am disappointed and ashamed that this lovely new addition to the Phoenix museum culture has made the decision to be so exclusive. I would love to be proven wrong, and invite anyone who knows about such things behind the scenes to explain to me how my impressions are inaccurate.   I will take my $250 membership "donation" and give it to KBAQ, where anyone with access to a radio can listen to music regardless of income level.

Holy Virtuous, Batman! My recent conversion to eating vegan has made it a little more challenging to eat out, so when my husband suggested we eat at The Grind, I thought I was going to have to cave in the presence of the amazingly fantastic Sweet and Spicy Burger.   Ho HO, I say! They made me a S&S Burger with a portobello instead, sans cheese, without even batting an eyelash. And cripes, it was Just. As. Good. as the sinful version. I didn't even feel like I was missing anything, because it's really the toppings that make Grind patrons sing.   My vegan leanings do not arise from allergies, but rather general health reasons, so I'm a little more flexible than others might be...so, no, I don't know if the buns have dairy in them (but few bread products do) and when I realized my burger came slathered in a spicy mayo, I just scraped it off instead of sending it back. But next time, I'll know to ask them to hold the mayo and pile on extra arugula.   I'm assuming the amazing tarragon-infused fries are fried in vegetable oil, and if they're not, then I just want to remain blissfully ignorant.   I bet they would even make a portobello substitution for any of their burgers. Can't wait to go back to find out!

Mediocre.   The layout is awesome, I'll give them that. Very cool open bar and patio setup. We sat inside because that's what was available soonest, but I would rather have sat outside because it was so LOUD inside.   **Why, oh WHY do restaurants think that in order to be hip and popular they have to play really loud music? Can't you turn it down a notch? Please, don't think that we all have to be a Ra Sushi joint...***  OK, rant over. This place only gets two stars because, after you get over the cool setup, it's just another fancy burger joint among fancy burger joints, and there are many better ones very close by.   Food: Too expensive for what you get. Those burgers look mighty lonely on those big plates if you don't feel like shelling out more money for what should already be included (fries, duh).   I had the veggie burger, which tasted good but was so mushy that pieces were falling out every time I took a bite. I practically needed a spoon.   Husband had the plain and simple. He was not wowed.   We got an order of truffle fries, which were good, but really salty. Good portion size.  We also got an order of zucchini fries. Also good, nice and crispy.   We thought about getting dessert shakes for about 0.2 seconds, but then decided our $6 (SIX? What, do you mix gold flakes in there??) were better spent down the way at Mojo. I might consider going there to get some pie when a craving strikes, but again, I expect a nirvana experience for those prices.   Service: fine. Timely. No complaints.  Ambience: the place kind of smelled like bleach. Ick.   Conclusion: Unless you're jonesing for a night out at a cool bar, skip the restaurant and spend your money at Maizie's, Hula's, or Delux for a better burger experience.   Zinburger, we waited so darn long...you could have done better. Give us more for our money, and maybe well be back.

Got takeout from here on Friday for the Biltmore's Movies in the Park. I was very pleased with my experience, and look forward to dining in sometime. It far surpasses the pizza that was served by its predecessor.   We ordered one pizza with mozzarella, provolone, salami (which is basically pepperoni), and basil. They make a lovely wood-fired crust, and the ingredients were fresh and superb. This is a pizza reminiscent of Cibo or Parlor, but not as expensive (but it starts to add up with the toppings, so beware).  We also ordered a two-cheese appetizer, with bufalo and smoked mozzarella, both of which were very tasty. They came with ample grilled/marinated peppers, zucchini, and eggplant, most of which I piled on to my pizza.   My only complaint was that the appetizer was kind of messy to eat and it seemed like a good crusty bread would be a natural accompaniment.   And a final detail that they may amend in the future: they don't have a menu online, so I had to call to have one faxed to my office so I could order takeout.

Lovely little restaurant, terrific food. I had the soup/salad combo with Chipotle Chocolate Soup and the Sunflower Salad. The Soup was divine, with a blissful mini corn-muffin as garnish. The salad was pretty and just the right size. I splurged and got dessert, caramelized bananas over rice pudding which had luscious burnt-sugar bits floating in a buttery, sugary sauce poured over a not-overly-sweet rice pudding.  Mmmmmmmmmmm.

Have long lamented the lack of a true independent theater in Phoenix, and we were so excited when FilmBar opened! We have been to several movies and the staff is welcoming, the drink list is long, and the price is more than reasonable.   Please support this establishment...we need more than just AMC and Harkins here!

This place is lovely. I stopped in for lunch today after reading the ROTD. It is a little hard to find, and could use some more prominent signage, but I found it. I was the only one there for lunch, and my server was attentive at just the right moments, but not obtrusive at all.   For $9, I got an enormous bowl of chicken soup (the Cambodian version of Pho, for reference), a gigantic spring roll, and a glass of grass jelly juice, which I can only describe as a boba-like drink.   I am so glad I found this little place, because it will be such a nice change of pace to get my southeast Asian food fix in a friendly, clean, cute restaurant instead of braving the health code disasters on 19th Ave.   Please seek this place out and give it your business so we can keep it alive!

I've always liked the food here. Tonight's review is about the service.  Our house was robbed today while I was out running errands with my two small kids. We arrived home to find our house trashed, valuables stolen, and our sense of security violated. After dealing with the police, the fingerprint dusting, and trying to figure out what is gone, I couldn't imagine cooking dinner and just wanted comfort food.   I found myself at Rice Paper. The tall redheaded bartender and his coworkers kept me entertained and made me smile after a rough day.   And the pho really hit the spot!

We tried this out last night. We won't be back.   There is no indication when you walk in that it's a seat-yourself restaurant. We stood like idiots at the hostess area until somone asked us if we needed something.   We sat ourselves, and then sat and sat and sat because there was no server assigned to us. Perhaps that is a reason to seat patrons, so a server knows they've arrived?  Finally, the hostess asked us if anyone had helped us, and she was very polite and took our order.   Our drinks came out fairly quickly, but then we waited and waited for our food. This would have been understandable if the placed had been packed, but it wasn't. It was maybe 75% full (7:30 on Saturday) and there seemed to be plenty of servers. There was one large party on the patio.  I ordered the vegetarian salad (can't remember what it was called) that advertised avocado, jicama, beans, and other yummy things. When it arrived, there was a tiny little mushy sliver of avocado perched on top, and no more to be found. It was as if someone scraped up the dregs of an avocado from the rind of an empty one and flung it on my salad. It would have been more forgiveable if they had just forgotten it altogether. Also, the white beans were undercooked.   The pizzas were good. I ordered the local organic vegetable one without cheese, and it came loaded with summer squash, roasted carrots, olives (local? Hmm...), leeks, roasted onions, and the crust was thin and crispy. My husband also enjoyed his pizza.   I should actually grant an additional half star to the hostess/waitress, who comped my salad when I complained about it. I was willing to pay for it, but she offered to take it off the bill.   The final nail in the coffin was perhaps not the fault of the restaurant, but the large party out on the patio had 3-4 elementary-age kids literally running laps through the restaurant for the first 15-20 minutes we were there. If ignorant parents are content to let their hellions ruin other diners' experiences, then I'm afraid it's left to the restaruant to politely and discreetely ask the parents to please reign them in. No such luck.   Anyway, this place has some things to work on. Fortunately for us, there are too many other great businesses nearby for us to give it a second chance.

I'm really liking TKD so far because the whole experience is based on discipline and respect. Mr. Joe has the kids turn to bow at all of the parents at the beginning and the end of class, and they have to shout Yes, Sir! in response to everything, and he won't let anyone in the class continue in their routines until everyone has responded appropriately. And they love him. He is very patient and kind, and consistently redirects their focus when they stray. Tough task in a crowd of 5-7 year olds!

It's too bad this place has changed ownership. We stopped in the other day for their advertised Pizza Slice special (I think it was two slices and a soda for $3.99). My husband walked up to the kid at the register and said,  "Two slices of cheese, please."  ...silence...  ...blank stare...  The kid grinned uncomfortably and said, "Cheese? Two slices? Umm..."  I realized what was happening and interrupted: "Two slices of cheese PIZZA, please."  The kid finally understood. He thought my husband wanted two slices of cheese. Literally.   So finally the woman (owner?) came up and asked pretty abruptly what we wanted. We told her, and she said she doesn't keep slices ready, she has to make a whole pizza and then cut slices. She clearly thought we were retarded.   We left.   So, besides the obvious customer service and advertising failures, my third criticism is that they need to decide on an identity and stick with it. Are you a gyro place or a pizza place? That, in my opinion, was the downfall of the previous owner. He should have stuck with gyros and other Greek items, because he did them well. The place is too small to try to please everybody.

Beautiful meal. Lovely airy restaurant. The menu is small, in keeping with the Pane Bianco tradition of offering a few items done really right, rather than hundreds of items done just like everyone else does them.   I am a sucker for fresh pasta. The fresh fettuccine with lemon, olive oil and kale was a winner, as were the baked corona beans. I don't know if the spaghetti pomodoro was fresh, but it was delicious.   We split the flourless chocolate cake for dessert. It was magical. I don't usually like chocolate, but this was like eating whipped rich chocolate air with a thin layer of delicate crust on the bottom. I would eat 5 more pieces of that cake if I could possibly fit any more food in me.

Another excellent meal. Word is getting out around town about this place...last time we went, it was early-ish on  Saturday and there were maybe two or three other couples there. Tonight, Saturday, we arrived at 5:45 and were told it would be over an hour without a reservation. Fortunately, there were two seats at the bar, so we didn't have to wait.   The food was, again, spot on and delicious. The service was great and gracious, and Bianco was greeting and thanking diners left and right.   The choices are limited (or possibly nonexistent) for strict vegans, but there's always something vegetarian on the menu if you don't mind being a little flexible on the cheese thing.  We shared the chickpea-flour crepe with olive, sage and red onion. This was fabulous, reminiscent of a potato pancake but more delicate.   I ordered the Fresh pasta with eggplant ragu, which was velvety with deep, garlicky, parmesan, and husband had the gnocchi with fresh corn. Also terrific.  There's a rotating menu, but I think there's always some variation of a bean side dish. Get it. The two we've had have been excellent. Also, the flourless chocolate cake is a must, and I think they have it every night.   Really, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!

We went here this morning and had a very pleasant breakfast experience. I have been to a couple of the previous iterations, and I hope WyKnot is able to stick around longer than its predecessors.   My (presumed vegan) tofu burrito was piping hot, savory, and chock full of tasty fresh spinach, mushrooms, and potatoes. Tofu entrees are so often bland; this was anything but. The side of salsa was also very flavorful with a little kick.   Husband ordered the classic burrito and subbed tofu for the bacon; he said it was great.   My soy latte was large and tasty.   Service was very friendly. Price was reasonable. We will continue to support this little place.

I really appreciated how quickly these guys came over to rekey our locks after a burglary. Our house was robbed last night, and not until the middle of today did I realize that a bag with my house key was among the items stolen.   I called Downtown Locksmith and explained the situation and the locksmiths were at my house in 10 minutes.   Thank you for easing my mind and doing a nice job on the locks!

What an adorable, comfortable adaptive reuse. If you're an historic building nut, you will enjoy knowing that the coffee is made in what used to be a pool house, then you walk across the small yard where the pool used to be, and sit in the bright, quiet, cool Living Room where the dentist's office used to be. The second story is all old apartments.   Oh, and the lemonade and cheddar biscuits: delicious.

Really nice little museum. Kids (and grown ups) can sit in the restored police car and on the motorcycle. The exhibits are interesting and informative. The staff is very enthusiastic and devoted. A touching fallen officers memorial in one room.   The location is wrong, though. It's in the back of the old courthouse on Jefferson.

No need to add to the raves about the food, but I wanted to speak up about the great service we got last night at Federal. It was a Friday night and we had reservations for 5 people at 7pm.   We only had one of our party there by 7, and they seated him without giving him any pushback about needing the whole party there. Three more of us arrived by 7:30,and the last person was there by 8. Not once did anyone give us trouble about monopolozing a table, and they even let the last person order her pizza when she arrived.   The dinner was a going-away celebration for a very good friend who has had a very rough time lately, and it was a much-needed send-off for all of us.   Thanks, FP, for recognizing that we are going to spend money at your establishment even if we're a little late. Sometimes planes don't arrive on time, trucks don't get packed as quickly as we intend, and emotions run high when you're picking up your life and moving across the country. Thanks for helping us relax at the end of a hard day.

I finally got to try this new neighborhood joint. It was GREAT. The staff was enthusiastic and gracious, the price was reasonable (even a bit low given the quality of the food), and the food was fantastic. Hand-crafted tortillas, custom-built, fire baked enchiladas with a multitude of fillings, amazing sauces, and killer soup means I will be back.   I had 2 enchiladas with spinach-mushroom filling, the smoky red sauce, and topped with pickled onions, slaw, and 3-chile vinaigrette. I also had soup with no meat and added a dollop of super-flavorful mashed potatoes.   If you go right at noon on a weekday, expect the lunch crowd crush to make parking and eating in a challenge. I got there at 11:45 and had no trouble.   If I were trying to grab a quick lunch with a friend during work, I would probably be prepared to send one person in to place a to-go order while the other person drives around the block.   Support this little gem. The building has been empty for so long, and I hear rumor that a Qdoba or ZTejas is being built right across the street. It is up to the locals to keep local options alive!  PS please consider adding packs of a dozen tortillas to go to your menu. I would definitely buy them to have at home.

Dear La Condesisima or whoever you are now...I don't need to add to the already glowing reviews of your food, I love it and hope you stay around forever (especially your chile oil...I could drink that stuff).  In fact, I love it so much that I frequently crave it on my way home from work....but I am almost always thwarted by the fact that no one ever answers the phone to take my order. I'm not going to stop and wait for you to take and make my order when I'm trying to bring dinner home to my kids, I just want to order over the phone so I can walk in and pick it up.   Please answer your phone so I can spend my money at your place.  (unless you're trying to discourage take-out orders, in which case please tell me so I can stop getting my hopes up when the craving strikes!)   Thanks!

Finally stopped in to this adorable new place. Central Phoenix has another great coffeehouse, yay! I particularly enjoyed the cinnamon roll, which was a buttery, flaky, croissant-like masterpiece.   The interior is bright and comfortable. Lots of outlets if needed. There is a cute patio in back. Support these guys!

Please please please spend money here and show them we want them to stay in our neighborhood!!!   I had lunch here today and it was terrific. Think Pane Bianco if you need a reference for the kind of food they serve, as well as the ambience. I had the Cattle Bean soup with farro and quinoa, which was hearty and delicious.   Then I had one of the sandwiches with thin-sliced salame, cheddar, olive oil, and Anaheim chiles. There was a generous helping of butter lettuce and rainbow carrot salad on the side. The bread on the sandwiches is thin and pillowy with a crispy exterior and chewy interior. Really, really flavorful.   I couldn't leave without trying the "Small Bite" of grapefruit, marinated celery, and sliced castelvetrano olives. The celery was sliced thin like slivered almonds and delivered the perfect crunch against the grapefruit and olives.   I hope people seek Noble Eatery out. I will get back there soon.
