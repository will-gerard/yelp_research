We would consider coup des tartes one of the best restaurants we have been to in phoenix.    The ambiance is charming, the service is unobtrusive, a wonderful place for date.  We have been three times and never left disappointed.  Anything with a tart will be amazing (both sweet and savory).  The lobster parpadelle was fantastic and brie brulee is a delicious meal in itself.  The other entrees we have had were defitely above average.  We love the byob aspect, but in reference to a recent post, I belive the corkage is not $18 but $9.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone.

We went to T cooks tonight for our anniversary.  We were a little nervous after reading some unpleasant reviews, but we had a wonderful time. Robert, our server was fantastic.  My Husband had the quail for the first course which he said was ok, but our entrees were really great.  My lobster was fantastic! The pea shoot ravioli's were amazing.  My husband had the filet which he was very happy with.  For desert we had the peanut butter banana brioche with bacon and the creme brûlée cheesecake. The peanut butter brioche was out of this world. The only downside was the back waiter who was a little overzealous to clear the dishes....but all in all it was a wonderful meal in a beautiful setting.  I think it is a little overpriced but still a great dining experience.

Atmosphere -4/5  Service- 5/5 -- a nicely dressed manager came around and made sure  everything was okay; the waiter cleared the crumbs from our  table twice. We shared  dishes, they split our plates without us even asking them to.  The service was better than a lot of haute cuisine places we've gone to.   Food-4/5---  we love the "big ass' burger, the cheese grits with jalepeno was surprisingly delish.  We like RF a lot, has one of the best burgers in Phx.  We like to catch the happy hour someday.

We tried it because of rave reviews we have heard, but left disappointed.  The ambiance was fine execpt towards the end of our meal they decided to adjust a table nearby and it became like a construction zone with drills and loud power tools.  Granted it was during lunch, but we still felt it could have been done at another time when most of the restaurant was not full.  The burgers were okay, but not at all what I would consider great.  They were not very juicy, or flavorful in and of themselves, but there were interesting toppings to choose from. And, despite the burgers not being juicy the bottom of the buns were falling apart.  The service was pleasant but the food didn't really hit the mark on our visit.
