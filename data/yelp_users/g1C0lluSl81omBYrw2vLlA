So you decide what your conclusion is... Store closes at 11pm on Tuesday, sitting there and they shut the lights off at 10:50, leaving me and my girlfriend in the dark to finish our drinks and talk for the remaining time. Legally a bar must stay open for 30 min after last call but I guess chilis wanted us out.. Shitty way to treat customers..

Austin is the man, he really knows what he is doing and has a great attitude.  Knew exactly what I wanted and has given me the best cut I literally have ever had.  No joke or gimmicks. If you're looking for a great classic barber for a great experience and price come here!  Will be visiting Austin again!

I live in Tempe and go to ASU so it's hard to find a bar that compares to the status of powerhouse bars found in Tempe and Scottsdale. The Hights is an exception, this place is awesome. Fantastic service, prices, and an even better atmosphere. I totally recommend trying this place out! You'll for sure be back again.  -Michael

What I want from this review is for the ways of jipping the customer off to stop. Don't tell me that that's the way an ultra light beer comes; an inch head. We're not talking about an IPA or anything. Please make some changes. And learn about "heads".  Well, Zipps is one of my favorite places to go and I frequent this place A LOT! It's very sad to see that the manager is stiffing the guests with the pours on beer, makes me wonder what else they stiff on.  Ordered a Michalobe Ultra and it came to me with at least an inch of beer missing from the top. And it came the second and third again like that. I started watching the drinks being served by the manager and they all had the same shitty pour. I sent the first one back and the said there is nothing they can do because the manager yells at them for that. Not proper.  Thx

This place is awesome!!! It's BYOB and the same owner owns the liquor store next to it, can you say convenient. They are super nice and cater to your needs. I asked for a special order and they didn't hesitate to help me out.  I will definitely be back and recommend getting to this place ASAP. #happycustomer
