I know little and less about bicycles other than how to put air in them and use them, and these people are great, super helpful and honest about what you need it seems, but time will tell! So far so good though.

DO NOT BUY GEEK SQUAD INSURANCE.  I just bought a brand new galaxy note 4 last week with the full package insurance. After being told I would get $100 off for trading in my iphone, I had to ask as I'm about to swipe my card why I would not get credited, reason, I had a small crack on the back. This crack does not influence phone function or the front screen, cameras, or any phone function. Thanks guys for telling me after I have the plastic out.  A week later, my phone was lost/stolen after a night out. I go to geek squad and after waiting on the phone for upwards of an hour. I finally get to the deductable for the phone. It's $240. The same price as a new Galaxy with a new 2 year contract. OHHHHH and the real kickers are, it takes 2-5 business days for it to arrive AND it's a refurbished phone, not a brand new phone a flippin broken and fixed leftover. I'm beyond furious with them. Also I had to ask the manager about anyway to walk out of the store with some sort of phone, and she more or less dismissed me. This 1 star goes to geek squad. Well done guys seriously you earned this one.  Like I said this review is for Geek Squad NOT the rest of best buy. The computer guys there are fantastic. I've talked to a couple of them and they have been nothing but knowledgeable, honest, and straightforward. If you have computer problems they are the ones to go to hands down. They won't steer you in the wrong direction.

These people are awesome, always straight forward and upfront about what they're selling/helping you with. I've had 2 insurance claims now that have really saved my bacon, and the insurance process is pretty lengthy but nothing too crazy. Their recommendations are insightful and they're eager to point you to other businesses like UBreakIFix just down the street for reasonably priced phone fixes.  Mike and Melissa have now both helped me and are AWESOME! Mike two years ago helped me get back up and running after my phone was stolen, and Melissa literally sat with me for 50 minutes as I tried to cancel insurance through Geek Squad (which is awful F.Y.I.) so I could save over $90 on an insurance claim. Just can't explain how well they have treated me here, it's super appreciated you two, seriously!
