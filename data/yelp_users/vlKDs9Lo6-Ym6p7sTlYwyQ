I love Paradise Bakery and have done so for years but, the location on Signal Butte and Baseline is notorious for having terrible service, lack of staff and rudeness to be blunt. We just left the location after standing in a line of 2 people for over 5 minutes. We were being totally ignored at the soup bar after having our salads made. Even the manager ignored us!  If you want a quick enjoyable meal, I would do the same as us.... Drive across the parking lot to 'Rubios' where they greeted us with a warm friendly smile and couldn't be happier to take our order promptly.

Here we go again, another bad experience with the staff at Cobblestone!   My family has become accustom to the high pressure sales, poor customer service and the below average wash jobs but today tops it all. I took my daughters car in for fuel and purchased the "Quickys" Best wash at the pump. After paying for the wash and driving over to the express lanes they were blocked off with yellow cones. I then decided to pull into the main lane line and asked Wayne (service writer) what the issue was. I was confused as I was able to pay for the wash at the gas pump even though it was blocked off. Wayne acted as though he was unaware of any issue and stated he would check with his manager Jordan. As I listened to them speak through the walkie talkies I could not believe the language Jordan used, and in short stated I will need to come back another day. At this point I expressed to Wayne that I would like Jordan (manager) to come over as I now have 3 cars behind me and had already paid for the wash. Wayne attempted to call Jordan again and he failed to respond. I then asked Wayne to call the store manager JR as I want this resolved. I was then told JR was off today so I asked Wayne to go get Jordan over here which he finally did. I expressed to Jordan I just paid for the wash and I would like the car washed, which he stated the express service is down and he could not help me.  At this point I expressed to him, either refund my money or wash the car somehow. He then stated that he would run the car through but I would not get the wash I paid for as they are having problems with the tunnel. I asked him "What about the other 10 cars I've watched run through the tunnel while I was waiting?" He stated they paid for the FULL SERIVICE WASH. I told him that is fine and I would just chalk it up to another bad experience at Cobblestone. As I came out of the tunnel Jordan is waiting and I assumed he was going to give me the wipe down rag and the air freshener that should have been included in the wash. What happened when I rolled down the window I could not even believe! Jordan (The On Duty Manager) stated he would need the $10.00 back that the service writer Wayne reimbursed to me, due to the issues? I explained to Jordan that never happened and I am very offended that he would ask me for $10.00! (this is not even the amount I paid for the wash).  I told to him I am going to go dry off my car and then go inside to get the corporate number.  He then again asked me about the $10.00!  I told him this makes no sense at all, that a service writer would give me money out of his pocket? I expressed to him I own a business and that would never happen and I feel I am being accused of stealing money.  I asked Jordan for the wipe down rag and air freshener I paid for and he stated he could not help me. Not only did I get screwed out of the wash I paid for, but also got accused of stealing $10.00 from the service writer! I told Jordan he may want to check the security cameras and he will see this never happened.   After I dried off the car with a paper towel I went inside and spoke to the assistant manager. She told me I could speak with Jordan about it today or call JR the location manager on Tuesday. I asked for the corporate number which she kindly provided.  I called the number given and left a message at extension 2254 and have yet to hear back. From now on, I think I will just stick with Car Spa. They are a little further but I am done at this place.

Wow..... Locally owned, and operated by my 2 favorite people Denise and Andrew. Every time I go to the store the service is amazing. So friendly and professional. From the wine tastings, treats, jams/jellies, snacks and caramels... I could spend all day there. I have used them on many occasions to send Christmas and Birthday baskets to family that live out of town. I always get a phone call from them telling me it was the best gift basket they have ever received. Why wouldn't they, most of the yummy treats are made in the stores giant commercial kitchen. I always make sure I have the Tequila Lime Habanero jelly in the fridge, as it is my favorite. The Champagne Honey Mustard with Horseradish is a must too.  Did I mention that D'Vine has an amazing wine selection (pretty sure I did already). All I can say is Malbec, Malbec, and more Malbec. They introduced me to my now favorite bottle. I usually buy 4 bottles at a time as I worry they might sell out. Just got a new Syrah and Merlot which I cant wait to try this weekend.   This is my go-to shop for all local edible gifts!

Dr Davis and his team are amazing!  The dental hygienists in the office are gentle and thorough in teeth cleaning. I am not someone who enjoys the dentist so I am always anxious when it comes to my check-ups. However, Dr. Davis does such a great job at keeping me calm, and keeping it fun.  Dr. Davis also explains all your options for dental care, and is very skilled at cosmetic dentistry as well. I actually look forward to future visits. I highly recommend Chandler Dental, Dr Davis, and his friendly staff.

Where do I start with this amazing company...... Charlie and Allan are the most professional, trustworthy, and knowledgeable businessmen.... as well as highly entertaining. They certainly bring fun to the experience, and totally make you feel at ease when they are at your home.  I had problems with crickets and they came out and did their job. I have been using these guys for almost a year now, and would highly recommend them to everyone that will listen.

Although it seems redundant, I feel compelled to write a review about my experience, or lack thereof, with Chef Michael Denton.  After carefully studying all social media sites and Yelp, I selecting Chef Michael based on his reviews and personal attention in his emails, and flexibility in his quote. I told him that we wanted to host an intimate Graduation Dinner for our daughter and, family that were coming in from out of state. The emails back and forth from Michael seemed very professional, and prompt. Never did it cross my mind that we would be a victim of Chef Michael's unreliability.  Through email confirmations, PayPal deposit, and text messages, Chef Michael and I set the date and time two weeks in advance.  As the day came, we spoke 2 times via phone, and even 2 hours before the dinner (as I was entering ASU). Chef Michael told me he was at his house making the Cr√®me Brulee desert, and then he would be heading over to our house.  He said that we should go ahead and enjoy the night as he had everything under control. He even mentioned that he was a night owl and that we shouldn't rush home, which sounded great as this is a once in a lifetime moment and we wanted to get plenty of pictures.   As we were leaving the ceremony (approx 9:30pm), I checked my phone and Chef Michael was calling me. I answered in an excited tone, and asked him if he needed to know where things were in the kitchen and that we were about to head home. I had a really bad feeling when I heard him say the words "I think I'm lost! I really wanted to come and cook for you tonight, but.......". Then silence. I asked him where he was and that I could help with directions, but he seemed very uncommunicative, unapologetic, and quiet. I kept asking him over and over, "Where are you? Can you name a landmark?". He told me that his GPS was not picking up as his car is very low and it interferes with the signal. I told him we were on our way home now, and that we had very hungry people, with NO backup plan. After a couple of calls back and forth, it was very apparent that he had no intention of coming over to the house, or willingness for us to help him with directions (we had no idea where he was anyway).  HE COMPLETELY FAILED US!  We called every restaurant in town, but everything was fully booked or already closed. With utter humiliation, and feeling completely mortified we headed home and ordered pizza. We were all in complete shock that someone would do this. I would NEVER give a recommendation of this so called Chef Michael. His food could be amazing, but unfortunately we will never know!
