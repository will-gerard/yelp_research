If you think making an appointment will prevent you from waiting - think again!  This salon is located near my house so I have tried it many times - each time hoping for a better experience.  Unless you are the first one in the door in the morning, plan on waiting.  If you have an appointment, you may even wait longer.  What is frustrating, is they will always tell you that will be a "few minutes" even if the wait is really 40minutes.  The last time I was there,  I had an appointment at 1:00 and wasn't seen until 1:40pm!  When I asked how much longer, the male owner, kept saying, "few minutes."  When I gave him feedback on how it would be really nice if they could be more accurate with how late they are running so people could run to walgreens or come back, he said, "If you don't like it - go someplace else- we have plenty of business!"  Since I tip so well, I was shocked at how I was treated.   The fact that my gel polish would ALWAYS come off after only 1 week and the pedicures weren't that great made me wonder why I was even trying to make this nicely located nail salon work for me.  I will never go back!

I give this place 2 stars for the overall experience.   For Gel Polish, I would give them 1 star.  They have a small color selection and don't carry the latest OPI Gel Polish.  Unfortunately, I've tried gel polish from here twice and each time it lasted only a week - at best!  Since they don't have the traffic as some of the busier salons, they let their polish get "old" and it affects the longevity of your mani or pedi.    For pedicure's, I would give this place 3.5 stars.  I personally still go here for pedicure's only and I bring my own polish.  For a simple manicure, they tend to over file the top of my nails  and I end up getting a lot of breakage after their manicure's, so I no longer let them touch my fingernails....toes only!  The best girl for toes was Anna, who - unfortunately, is gone.  She fixed some severe ingrown toenails of some friends of mine.   New girls have replaced her.  The new girls seem nice and do a decent job.    A big plus for this salon is that they do run ON TIME!  If you have an appointment, you will be seen on time.  How do they stay on time?  If you are late for an appointment, they will either cut your appt. short or they won't see you.  I see this as a plus.    The owner and her husband could take a cue from their employee's on how to be friendly.  Bottom line:  Bring your own polish and go here for "toes only" - for a good price and on time pedicure.  (This is the Salon located in the Safeway shopping center right across from Big League Dugout.)

If you've read my previous reviews on nail salons, you know that I have never given 5 stars.  In fact, I have been looking for a salon to do a consistent fab job on a gel mani for months.  I have now gone to the Desert Nail Spa 3 times, and received a fabulous gel manicure EVERY time.  I never review a salon after only one visit, to make sure it is either consistently good or consistently bad - and this place is my new "go-to" place.  As an image consultant and makeover advisor, I can't have my nails looking "wrong."  I have seen both Cindy and Kelly and they both did a fantastic job!  The manicure was executed perfectly, shape fab and it lasted a good 2 1/2 weeks!  The owners are professional and grateful for your business - unlike other salons where they shuttle you in and out.  Honestly, it is one of the most professionally run nail salons that I have ever been to.  You can see a photo of my last manicure on my twitter page, @_DianeFaith.  I always call to make an appointment and have never had to wait.  I am beyond thrilled to finally find a nail salon that I "love."  Yeah!

Great kosher food and they have this fabulous kosher fake "bacon" that I love to buy.  Greasy, but so good....moderation is everything right?  The owners are some of the nicest people on the planet and if you are looking for kosher food - they have a great selection.  I will sometimes have them make me several different salads before a Yom Tov and they really do an amazing job!

Fry's has it all! I live at this store. Great bakery, flowers  everything! If you are looking for Kosher meat- they have a great selection. Covered parking and valet!

Unfortunately, upper management decided to "rework" the store and now it feels more like a VERY low end Walmart whereas it used to feel like a large scale A.J.'s Fine foods.   The gift selections in the front of the store have been replaced with junky "clearance" items.  Even the paper goods isle is pathetic- having mostly only foam plates.  I don't plan to shop at Fry's anymore.  It may be hard to believe, but Albertson's is nicer and its employees are much nicer.  So I will shop Albertson's for basics and Whole Foods/Trader Joe's for everything else!  So long Fry's!

Unfortunately, since this fab store is closing, they could care less about their customers.  They will tell you that you can return something even though they will be closing soon...and they won't honor this policy.  I bought several door knobs for my remodel and ended up with 2 too many (Baldwin knobs) and they wouldn't take them back even though they specifically told me they would.

Beyond delicious! I highly recommend the mini's!  Had a small party and served a bunch of mini's along with a tiered cake (among other desserts.)  No one wanted to eat the tiered cake because it looked so amazing they didn't want to cut it!  It was so beautiful, looked more like a center piece.  The mini's flew off the dessert table.  I should have taken the tiered cake apart and sliced it - but it really was almost to pretty to eat.  2di4!

I love this place.  I was a member several years ago and I found that I was just too busy to get a monthly massage.  What was I thinking?  I went again on Sunday morning, and joined again....deciding that giving myself an hour a month isn't too much to ask of myself!  They have very experienced massage therapists here and I feel that I get as good of a massage here as I do at the finer hotels.  Is it as relaxing and do you get the whole spa experience?  No.  But, honestly, I don't have time for that anyway.  I want my tight muscles to feel better, I want my body to feel good, and for the price....yeah!!!  I was told the prices are going up September 1st, so get in on the $59 a month for a massage now!  Fabulous!

I could write a book on the bad experiences I have had with this airline but I will spare you and provide just a few recent highlights - or should I say "lowlights?"    I only fly this Airline as the hub is in Phoenix (where I live) and I often find it to be the only option for a direct flight to where I am traveling. Although 3 or 4 stops may be more pleasant in the future!   I also unrealistically keep hoping my horrible experiences are a "fluke" and the next time will SURELY be better!     So let's just ignore for a minute the fact the flights rarely leave on-time.  And let's also ignore the fact that they  WAY overbook flights.  I used frequent flier miles to upgrade to first-class on a recent trip from Washington DC on March 22, 2016,  they overbooked that too - so I ended up sitting in the last seat in the plane up against the smelly bathroom without reclining seats without ANY refund for the 25,000 miles I used to upgrade; unless the back of the plane is now "first class" which is possible.   All that aside (because maybe I just had some bad luck) there is one really bad thing that cannot be ignored.    Drum roll please....the pilots are disgruntled and miserable!  Two pilots overheard me talking to someone else about my "experience."  They  approached me afterwards and told me that it isn't just the passengers who are treated poorly...they both said the pilots are ALL MISERABLE!  Since this recent trip, I have heard the same thing from other American Airlines pilots.  I'm sure the flight attendants are really treated like dirt if the pilots aren't even treated well.   Maybe that is why I thought I was going to die the last two landings. No joke.  Worst landings of my life and I've flown everywhere.  One of the landings, we had to take back off as the pilot ran out of runway, couldn't stop the plane in time and had to take back off or land us all in a river.  I'm sure he was just having a bad day as he's treated so poorly.  Or he just learned how to fly as all of the experienced pilots are headed to better airlines.   So,  next time we all go to buckle up, take comfort in knowing that the pilots are disgruntled employees with all of our lives in their hands.   Greyhound busses are suddenly an option and I'm not exactly a "bus" kind of girl.

My son sustained a concussion at this place and the employees could care less!  Although it is set up to have a ton of fun, accidents like this one could be prevented if the staff actually responded to complaints.  Apathetic teenagers are in charge of your child's safety.  We're still waiting to find out the extent of my son's head injury.  Learn from our mistake and take your children to a safer environment.

At first glance, this is your typical Vietnamese nail salon; clean with one female and two males ready to do your nails and barely speak English.  Over the summer, I went to this nail salon a few times and really tried to make it work (For a pedicure and gel polish.)  The men are PAINFULLY slow and a 2+ hour nail appointment just doesn't work in my schedule.  Kim, the female, is usually booked and seemed to be the best, so I gave her a try.  My August appointment with her went quite well with her doing a good job ; although I did have to try to ignore her very  bad mood.  Trying again,  I booked an appointment, and was quite disappointed to have to wait 40 minutes, only for her to lecture me that I was on my cell phone while I was waiting. She literally lectured me like I was 5 years old.  Okay, you're probably wondering why in the world I would give her ONE more try.  I always give people the benefit of the doubt, and since the salon is in a convenient location for me - I tried her again - for the last time - EVER.  After getting a pedicure (her pedicure's are always below average) and a gel manicure, I was beyond disappointed that my gel polish started to peel after 3 days.  This is the SECOND time this has happened to me at this salon.  I believe they use very old polish.  Although I reported it before, and popped in to show them the peeling from the cuticle, the reaction was irritation, like it was somehow my fault.  I went back today, with an appointment, to have Kim fix the two nails that were chipped and peeling from the cuticle, getting stuck in my hair.  For a $35.00 gel manicure (plus a generous tip), it should certainly last more than 3 to 4 days.  More importantly, since I was there for 2 1/2  hours last time, due to her booking multiple people at the same time and fixing other client's nails, I really didn't want to have to return to get two nails fixed less than a week later.   To my surprise, Kim acted so annoyed that I had the nerve to come back to get two nails fixed, she made me wait forever and told me  it was very inconvenient for her to fix my two nails.  Like I really wanted to spend another hour getting two nails fixed.  Go to this salon if you enjoy rude Vietnamese people who use OLD polish (consistently) and refuse to be polite when asked to fix a job poorly done.  There is really nothing nice about this place except that it is in a good location.  As a side note, the name of the place seems to change here and there.  You may save $15 by going to a Vietnamese salon, but this one will cost you more in the long run because your gel polish won't last as long and it's never been a good place for pedicures.

I've been a member for about a year and was surprised to read the other reviews about the equipment.  I use the Versa-Pro Spray tan and love it!  It hasn't worked maybe once the entire time.  The Versa-Pro allows for tailored results and dries quickly.  I especially love the convenient hours, being open starting at 8 am and closing at 10 pm.  I'm a fan!  Diane Faith-Lille

I love the smoothies at this place!  But they don't just have smoothies and juices, they have a large selection of healthy salad options!  I personally love how they have coconut water or almond milk to add to smoothies along with various protein options.  The place is very clean.  I don't generally like using public restrooms, but the restrooms here are always VERY clean.  Importantly, the people who work at Bowl of Greens are all very friendly. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars as they don't have "kid friendly" smoothie flavors for young children who aren't big fans of fruit.  A chocolate flavor would be fantastic for the "kids."   As a mom, it's nice to go to one place that makes everyone happy.  All in all - If you haven't tried it - you should!
