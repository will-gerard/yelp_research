Strike three- you are out!  This is the WORST dry cleaning service not only in Arizona, but possibly the United States.  The ***ONLY*** reason I have gone here was out of pure convenience as it is (luckily) located next to Trader Joe's.  Today marks the third time I have order 24 hr service to not have the order ready-- always an excuse.  Todays excuse was "I don't know what the girl in the back is doing."  I have a suggestion: How bout getting my clothing pressed on time?   Shame on me for giving my hard earned dollars to a business that is crap, poor customer service, and always late.  Do yourself a favor and find another dry cleaning service.  This place is not worth the overpriced dollar they charge.

Not only is the staff some of the friendliest in town, their food rocks.  This not your typical bar food scene.  Everything is fresh, the meat is quality and the drinks are stiff.

This is a truly authentic Italian restaurant.  I was a fan for years and unlike some of the eateries in town, when ownership changed hands, the quality of the food has remained consistently at a high level--  amazing white pizza and dinner specials never disappoint.  One of the few places that still makes food from scratch and the only place that has Peroni on tap.  Wine selection needs help, but other than that, a great place!!!

I've been a loyal patron for years and there is a reason why: this place rocks.  What a great escape and awesome outdoor bar.  Friday and Saturday nights are always a blast with live music.  Very chill vibe and the friendliest staff in town.  My only complaint is the eyesore restaurant across the way.

So sad to see Studio Vino go!  It was truly something special in Tempe.  Owners of other restaurants in town need to take a lesson from Kari. I wish her nothing but the best at Cellar 433.  (cellar433.com)

Although the name has changed over the years, the service, the trust, and the reliability has stayed the same.  These are the REAL good guys!  My mother just went there this morning and she posted this on Facebook:    "A BIG Shout Out and THANK YOU to all the wonderful, friendly guys at Ron's! I'm always somewhat panicked when the "service engine soon" light comes on in my car ... but I know I can always go there to get the problem resolved ASAP! They even opened up 20 minutes earlier than they had to for me and thank you SBJ it was only due for an oil change-$30...WHEW! Color me happy!"

Forget the old Pasanad and HELLO Chutney's!  The owner is bringing what real Indian food should look and taste like directly from the culinary capital of the world: San Francisco!  Order the "Lollipop Chicken" when it is being served and keep going back for more as, compared to Pasand, you have many options for your entree.  The only set-back outside of the new bright and cheery interior is the wait-staff is fairly young and inexperienced.  Ordering a dry martini was a challenge and was sent back as I basically got  a glass of vermouth and vodka-- not shaken, not stirred.  Why have a bar if you don't know how to use it?  Best bet:  stick with the Flying Horse beer.  A delicious way to wash down the spicy European influenced cuisine.  The joy and happiness the owner brings to environment is a welcomed changed form that dreary, drab, processed Indian food serving Pasand was.  Night and day.  Once the staff is up to snuff, this will be a five start rating for sure!

Okay-- first, the good: I was pleasantly surprised with  the interior of new restaurant in the Lakes community.  Love the open space, the fireplace and large leather chairs to create a very inviting ambiance.  There were just two of us ordering one grilled cheese ("grilled onions and mushrooms") and a glass of wine-- just taking baby steps on the menu, thank God.  Simple enough.  20 minutes later and after finishing our 2nd glass of wine, still no grilled cheese.  My friend and I were paying close attention to the orders that were being served (and sent back--wrong table, mis-orders, you name it) to the patrons across from us-- ribs were apparently overcooked and they too waited forever and day- and sent back, still wondering where the grilled cheese was?    So..... after three glasses of wine you would think my mood would've changed, still no food, alas, I used the restroom.  What a mess-- don't get me started...  Came back and low and behold- the grilled cheese "exclusive" sandwich straight from the kitchen!    After 45 minutes waiting with an empty restaurant, what we retrieved was a dish--- one you can get better at Denny's.  The cheese as stated by out 13 year old, bless her heart, waitress was a "chef's special." Cheese (obvious Kroger shredded cheese fresh out of plastic package it came in) WAS NOT MELTED, mushrooms-- button, chopped and not cooked properly with slimy onions smothered.....  Oh good Lord!  This is a GRILLED CHHESE PEOPLE!  Okay, I get it.  Watershed, you are new.   Welcome to the neighborhood.... you are in Tempe and trust me, as a person who's lived in such culinary perfection cities as SF and Seattle.... I get it.  The bar is set very low, but my God, try to at least get past the first hurdle!     The owner seemed very nice and professional-- I wish he would of been there to apologize instead of the 17 year old perky "manger" who didn't know how to take feedback as much as her C- art project in High School.  Is this cruel?  Hardy-- this is the truth and this place, if it plans to be around long enough in the money it has invested to get "started" has a long way to go.  Keep the fireplace, it is the best thing going for you- the fake grass on the patio is tacky.... and I could go on.  Food sucked, service lousy.  All in all, a total disappointment!

I am updating this review as the highly sensitive owner of the Watershed took the time out of his day to send his response to my Yelp review.  Enjoy!    __________________________________________________________    Hey Brett,  Dan Scott, the owner, here. Thanks for taking time out of your late Saturday night to review my soft opening. I reviewed your ticket and you paid for two glasses of wine for two people. We also comped your meal. And, as someone who has been in this business and the media business for 20 yrs, it's very unprofessional to review someone else's meal. Especially when we made that situation right and the client was in the end happy.  Do me a favor and forget we exist.   We make everything from scratch and are working our tails off to make this a fantastic restaurant/bar and I know we'll succeed.  By the way, my assistant manager talked to you because I was off the clock from my 16 hour day and just started to celebrate my good friends engagement that had just transpired at my restaurant. My newspaper, (Weekly Alibi) has been doing reviews of restaurants for 20+ years and we have a policy of going to a restaurant multiple times before giving our review.   I guess that's the difference in qualitative professionalism between real reviewers and the Bretts of the world.  __________________________________________________________  I think this speaks louder than words.
