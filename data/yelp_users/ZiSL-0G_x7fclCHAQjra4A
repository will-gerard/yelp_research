Can I give this 0 Stars? I guess not. Bottom line, there are no vegetarian options, the produce is really bad, the line was ridiculously long because there was only one cashier in the entire store. I am so disappointed in this Safeway and will not return.

Ahhh donuts, how I've missed you. I haven't had a good donut since I left Houston 3 years ago. I suffered though Dunkin Donuts, Le Caves and even Donut Wheel in Tucson. It was horrid. I contemplated making my own, but it just ain't the same.    I moved in down the street and decided to take a stroll to Rainbow this morning. I was super happy when my donuts were fresh and supernoms. I also ordered a Boba tea which was so good!  I am always  so disappointed when the boba to tea ratio is off, and I must say I was not disappointed today. Perfect!   It was hard to understand the lady behind the counter but that doesn't really affect the scoring. As long as the donuts are good, I am a happy lady. :)

We saw great reviews on Yelp and decided to try this place out. It looked a little iffy with its strip mall location but we decided to throw caution to the wind.   After sitting down our drink order was promptly taken and filled. After waiting a while (a bit too long), our order was taken. While we were exact in our order, the waiter fumbled and made mistake. We called the mistake to the waiter's attention and he said that this would be taken off the bill. It was not.   The sushi was C grade. Passable but not anything I would return for.   Our order came with a green salad that resembled bagged salad. The miso soup had iceberg lettuce in it. Quite surprising and added nothing spectacular to the dish.   My ramen was poorly executed, with undercooked noodles and only a few pieces of meat floating in it. I was really disappointed as I have had really great ramen at a handful of other restaurants around the country. I was looking forward to this japanese staple, but sadly left most of it in my bowl.   I find it odd that this restaurant serves both italian and japanese food, Maybe if they focused on one type of food the flavor and presentation would improve.   We will not be returning.

I was working with a salesperson, Larry, to view and eventually purchase a 2003 Honda Element. He first showed us this car in awful condition. It looked like someone had just totally trashed it before sending it in for a trade or before it was repo'd. I have no idea why he felt it was ok to show this car in this condition, but he did. He told us "everything will be fixed" and said for us to come back in two days. The repairs were (in his opinion) done, so we went for a test drive. After returning we noticed that there was a small panel that was unpainted, the wheel well trim was loose, the tint was coming off on one window, there were scratches and dings that hadn't been fixed and the seats were in really bad shape. We asked for these items to be fixed and if not for the price to be lowered. He called a manager to assist us during the negotiation process (why we let it go this far is beyond me). The manager flat out told us to buy the car or to leave.   I will never return to this dealership and recommend that you do the same. I've never been treated this poorly at a dealership in my life. I had cash to buy a car and opted to go elsewhere.

I met the owner at a Local First Arizona event and love that they are a neighborhood shop that takes pride in their workmanship and customer service. The shop and waiting area is clean, they return calls immediately and I really trust that my car is in good hands. If you want to get your car fixed by an honest and trustworthy mechanic, I would give these guys a call. :D

The food was amazing but the waitress was either in a horrible mood or she didn't like us. She made several snarky remarks, which made me want to leave. Thank G-d I stayed,  the food made up for her attitude.   Noms

This is the worst food I have had in Phoenix. I went here on a whim with a friend, seeking japanese food. I am not even sure what they served me. Terrible. Do not go here.

Oh the Tuck Shop. I love you, let me count the ways....   This tucked away gem was recommended to me by my Realtor and the owners of the house we just purchased. Both live in Coronado Historic District and are self proclaimed foodies. Being a foodie myself I thought to try this little place, that is easily missed if you don't look hard enough.   I was greeted at the door by a very sweet gentleman. I have to say that my food experience starts with hospitality. If I am ignored or spoken to in a condescending manner my perception of the experience is affected. Everyone in the restaurant treated us with respect and offered a smile. I really like the atmosphere they create with their generous hospitality.   The food at the Tuck shop is stellar. We decided to have a sampling of appetizers so that we could try many of the options. Their menu seasonal, so you may not be able to have the same options if you are visiting any time other than summer.   We shared the stuffed dates, pasta fries, and lobster mac and cheese. All of the selections were really wonderful. This is comfort food! The dates were stuffed with cheese and chorizo, the flavors balanced well and it was complimented with a tangy green salad. The pasta fries were so good that they were gone in 10 seconds flat. We literally inhaled them. The lobster mac and cheese was great and the flavors and textures really worked together.   If you are in Historic Coronado you should really try this restaurant. I am totally impressed with their brilliant food and service.   5 stars!

Wow! I am so impressed by this store. I went over to the Arcadia Location and was treated right. They offered me wine, had a special going on that they told me about and set up a dressing room for me. I went in dressed a little down and they didn't bat an eye. I was even given a coupon to visit their other store (this one), so since I had a little time and they are close I decided to go.   I was so happy when I showed up and saw a great selection at great prices. The woman behind the counter was really sweet and very helpful. It felt much easier than shopping at Buffalo Exchange, I didn't have to dig for something great and compete with 12 other hipsters. The whole shopping experience was relaxed and comfortable.   I am not sure about the negative reviews about this location. I had a really good experience and will gladly return. When I go to the same store in the same day you know it has got to be good! :)

2 stars because it was free.  If I had to pay for this I would have given them 1 star.   The esthetician totally ruined my right brow taking off about 1/4 inch too much. Now I have to regrow the brow and find a new place to go. I am going to have to fill in my brow and look like a chola until this comes back. Embarassing!   On top of this the esthetician waxed over the same spot twice, leaving the sensitive skin above my eyes inflamed. She had to go and pluck what she missed during the first two passes, which I think is really unnecessary. Most people do it once, pluck a few strays and you are out the door. I have a feeling she just graduated a low rent beauty school.  I will never return or refer.  Save your money and go elsewhere.

If you have the good fortune to find yourself in this wonderful salon, pat yourself on the back. They are listed as Allure's 100 Best Salons in the US for a reason.   AJ is fantastic and takes the time to listen to what you want. The Salon is well decorated and is very relaxed. I don't like uber trendy salons that make up for their lack of taste/quality with the volume of music. AJ and The Roose are the real deal. No need for gimmicks! Make an appointment and spread the love.

Wow!   I was pleasantly surprised when I stepped into this joint. The decor was fun, the restaurant was super clean and the food was so great! I am so excited that this is within walking distance of my home.   YOU MUST TRY THE HORCHATA! It tastes like my mom's except better. Wait? Is that even possible? Yes! I swear to little baby Jesus that this is the best horchata in the universe.   The Cochinita Pibil taco was great, the mole chicken taco was great and the salsa bar was killer. I tried 5 or 6 and they were fresh and uniquely flavored.   The best part? Three people ate for 20 bucks! I could have eaten cheaper if I had not gotten the plate. I took half of the food home, if that is any sign of the healthy (but not overly large) portions here. One taco would have done it for me.   I will be a regular at this place!  You should try it too! :)

Dragonfly Tea Company provided tea for the latest Local First Arizona event. Their tea was fabulous and the owner, Holly, is such a great person. She is very knowledgeable about tea and I am excited to visit her shop very soon. I highly recommend this business.

I have been tattooed here three times by three different artists- Jason, Paulski, and Honest Bob. They are all incredibly professional, kind, and talented.  They listen to my needs, make really thoughtful recommendations and produce quality art.   As a woman, I am apprehensive when going to a tattoo shop as they tend to be a "boys club" and they feel super hostile. I have always been treated so well at Golden Rule and highly recommend them to anyone looking for a great artist and a great environment.

Wow!   I had the great fortune to happen upon this place after seeing a post on Coronado Historic District's facebook page about a sale. I went in today trying to take advantage of the sale that is going on and was blown away by the great selection, the beautiful art space and gracious owner.   All of their items are reasonably priced, they have a great selection of clothing and accessories for men and women and the environment is chill. It is easy to miss this store driving by, if you don't see it... Look Again! :)

I absolutely love this place. I have had the carne asada, lingua, fish, chorizo, al pastor and horchata and all are phenomenal. To top it off the owner is really nice and makes sure everyone is happy. There is a reason this guy has been in the last three issues of Phoenix magazine. Go there now, you won't regret it!

If you want to escape the boredom and drudgery of working from home, you have to give Cohoots a shot! The space is incredible with no detail left out. There are showers for those who commute by bike and a coffee shop in front to get your caffeine fix. I like also knowing that I have a clean, comfortable place to work and am surrounded by other up and coming professionals. I feel super fortunate to have found this killer spot.

I really love this store. The owners are super nice and they always have really great gift suggestions, which is super useful. The only reason I am giving them four stars is because they are not open all week- which is a bummer. I often drive past the store, hoping to come in for a gift but they are closed.

Sweet baby Jesus. All of my prayers have been answered. I left the Great State of Texas three years ago and have been disappointed by so many bbq restaurants throughout the state of Arizona. I was saddened by the  "best bbq" in Tucson and decided that, until I lived in Texas again, I would just live a meaningless bbq free existence.   As I moped through another day in the hottest place on the planet, my very thoughtful partner suggested that we try the best bbq in Phoenix, according to the Phoenix New Times. I resisted. I said I was tired, I made up lame excuses, I feigned heat sickness. When I had no more excuses I finally relented and joined him in what would be the most delicious dinner I have had in three f*in years.   Highlights of the meal:  Brisket- Tender, delicious, excellent rub and crust Ribs- Fall of the bone meat with great flavor Sauce- Just enough tang and sweet. Balanced like a god damned ballerina Coleslaw- Sweet, sour, crunchy, yummy Potato salad-  Oh how I love thee  I will be back again. I will blog about them. I will tell my friends. You will not be disappointed. If you don't believe me, go anyway. They offer free samples. If you don't cream your jeans, you can just walk out the door.

I LOVE this hair salon. I was introduced to Vee, the owner of Hair Nirvana, through a friend and decided to give him a try. I just moved here and was nervous to entrust someone to my hair because I am:   1) Vain 2) A worry wart  I have used the same stylist for the last three years and never had to worry  about my hair. So, this was a little nerve wracking to say the least.   When I arrived at Hair Nirvana I immediately noticed the beautiful decor. Vee, the owner, has beautifully decorated the salon with Tibetan and Navajo art and jewelry. After asking about the art, I found that he is Navajo and studies Tibetan Buddhism. He purchases all of his good via fair trade and tries to use his salon to highlight Native American artists. This was the first clue that I wound up in the right place.   After we sat down in the chair he did an assessment. He looked at my hair to see how it naturally fell against my bone structure. We talked for a moment about what I was trying to accomplish and what would be best for me. He really took the time to listen and didn't just force his idea of beauty on me.   After the consultation he washed my hair and then gave me a beautiful hair cut. Not an "ok" hair cut, not an "I'm sorta satisfied" haircut. He did an awesome job. I went out after I got my hair cut and got half a dozen compliments immediately.   I am excited to return to his salon. I have since gotten a California Smooth treatment which has left my hair so smooth and nice. It is really easy to work with now, it was a little coarse and frizzy before the treatment. I also found out that he does color with organic products which is pretty exciting.  I am glad that I was unexpectedly turned on to this salon. I have a handful of cards and am now on a Hair Nirvana crusade, giving his card out to anyone who shoots me a compliment.   :)

Oh my! These cookies are fantastic. I brought them into work and everyone is my best friend now. The owners are super fantastic and have delivered for me on several occasions. I am so happy I found them through the Local First Arizona site. :)

I just visited Khyber Halal. The food was great, the price is right and the portion sizes were a little larger than necessary. The service was pretty slow though. I think we waited 15 minutes for someone to take our order and we had to ask for our check. Plan your lunch or dinner date accordingly and I think you will be happy. I am going to be bold and say, this is the best Afgan food in Phx.

Yes, Yes, Yes! I am so happy that we found this place. The yogurt here is fantastic, the toppings are great, the price is right and the decor is wonderful. One of the problems of frozen yogurt shops is the vibe. I actually feel like an adult in this place. It has a coffee house feeling and it is right next door to Hulas, which makes it easy to pop in after delicious food.   Yum!

I have been waiting ever so patiently for Gadzooks to open. I felt like that chic in the Mervyn's commercial standing at the window, saying "open, open, open." I drove by today and saw a parking lot FULL of cars. I quickly pulled over and ran to the door to snag a place in line.   It was totally worth the wait. They make the tortillas with fresh masa while you are in line, so it is totally fresh. The meat is incredible and the sauce is so flippin' delicious. I topped everything with pickled onions and a fried egg, my favorites.   I am a little apprehensive about this place opening though, because it is within walking distance to my house. I can feel my wallet crying already. I am going to be here often to try their other combos.

I love, love, love Uber. A scary amount of people I know have DUIs and I am super careful/paranoid, which is why this service is so valuable to me. I don't want to end up hanging out with Sheriff Joe after all...  I trust that Uber has my back when I am out on the town. The drivers are always super nice and they arrive on time with a clean, well maintained car. As a single woman, it is incredibly helpful to know that all of the drivers are given a thorough check to ensure my safety.   If you are hiring a cab, download the Uber app. I haven't used another car service since I started riding with them.
