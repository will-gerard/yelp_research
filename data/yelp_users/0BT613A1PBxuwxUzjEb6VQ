Many times a 5 star review is written by me but usually only after a 2nd visit or more.  Scott's will be the exception!!  I went on the recommendation of physician who raved about it the whole time I was with her this afternoon.  She was spot-on with her review and nothing could have made me happier today!    Upon arriving, I let the woman behind the counter know it was my first time and I wanted to check the place out.  She offered me a menu and told me to take my time and parouse the extremely large menu before deciding.    The menu was huge, to say the least!  A Chocolate Egg Creme started my afternoon off.  Excellent!!  After careful review, I decided on the Reuben Reuben.  A massive pile of corned beef between two pieces of rye and some wonderful sauerkraut all grilled to perfection.  The order came with 3 pickle spears, sweet and tangy cole slaw and some of the best crinkle-cut fries imaginable!!!  They were skin-on and thicker than most steak-cut fries, cooked to a dark color.  Yummy!!    My waitress was Nancy, someone who seemed to have been there for years and was a delight to say the least!!  Attentive but not bothersome.  She was there when I needed her and no where to be seen when I did not.  Just the way it should be.  Before departing, I decided to get a 1/2 pound of Chopped Liver to take home for the evening.  Its got to be one of my favorites when made right.  This was no exception either.  Creamy, flavorful and just the perfect texture.   When you have the chance, you have got to stop here!  The prices are on the higher end of the fair scale but for what you get, beyond well worth it.  This is an oasis in the desert that cannot be missed, especially for a transplanted easterner like myself!!  I am already planning my bext visit back!  Enjoy!

Today's review is a challenge as it's more about the service than the food itself.  If you want the Readers Digest version of the report, skip to the bottom paragraph.    Mom and I went there for dinner.  It was a Saturday night and the outside patio was packed, but it turns out that was a private party, the inside was much more free.    The Hostess greeted us with a welcome and asked if we had a reservation.  I asked "Do we need one?"  She replied we did not a lead us to a table in the corner near the front window.  We were only a party of two but she sat us at a 4-top, with plenty of twos available.  I guess they were not planning on being busy that night...?  Here's where the poor part of the evening began, with our waitress.  She came to the table without introduction and asked if we wanted drinks.  We did not so she quickly departed allowing us time to peruse the menu.  When she returned, her first words were, "Have you decided?"  Biting my tongue for fear of the endless comebacks I could have used, I asked about specials.  She jumped into recall-mode and tried to think about what was being offered, all without pricing or recommendations.   One of the items was interesting but not enough to make me change my mind on what I was intending on having.  I chose the Lasagna which comes with a soup or salad.  I chose the salad.  There must only be one choice as she did not ask me about my preferences so I have to assume its the only option.  Mom chose the Italian Wedding Soup which on the menu was listed as a single item but the waitress then asked "Large or Small?"  Wouldn't "Cup" or "Bowl" be more appropriate?  The other thing that chapped my ass about this waitress was the fact that we were there well before 6pm and there are Early Bird Dinner specials offered from 3-6 which she never suggested and looked to be a great value...about 6 separate items all for $9.95 each all of them something would like, too!  A basket of bread was brought out along with some Whipped Garlic & Herb Butter.  The bread was exceptionally dried out and squished as though it was cut when it was too hot and then left to air-dry into something reminiscent of old Scones.  Thank god for the butter, its what made he bread tolerable.    My salad arrived along with moms Wedding Soup.  Here is where he marks on this place are salvaged.  The Salad was perfectly proportioned, not too much or little.  The Soup was delicious as well.  OK, I am feeling a little redemption coming on here.    Getting my plate taken away was slow but a bus person finally came by and removed it.  We also requested at that time a refill of water and some fresh bread.  When it arrived this time, the bread was far better than the left overs served to us 20 minutes earlier.  (Maybe they heard us griping about it and this was their attempt at redeeming themselves)   My Lasagna finally arrived and this was impressive when first set down on the table.  Large portion, well presented and very tasty.  Lasagna is an interesting food item as its different everywhere you go.  Not always great but usually OK.....This was wonderful!  It was actually such a large portion I took about 1/2 of it home with me.  This, I would order again!  One thing we notices was the owner and his wife (mother?) walking around and stopping at a few tables.  Based on the conversations we could hear, they were all regulars.  What about us newbie's??  Do we not rate a quick stop to see how things are going??  This is YOUR restaurant and you want to keep the customers coming back, that should include the new guys too, right?  Never happened.  I felt like the red-headed step-child of the restaurant.     Once finished, we again had a new delay in getting the plates cleared as well as the waitress to come back by.  She finally did and asked if were interested in dessert but there was no room for me so we asked for the check.  Another delay.  It was delivered, hand written like in an old-school diner.  We left a credit card and again, another delay in getting it picked up.    Finally she dropped it by the table and said her thank you's....obviously a dinner bill of under $20 was not going to net her a huge tip so there was no need for small talk from her.    As we departed the owner and his wife said thank you and good night.  I stopped to ask him what the waitress's name was  who served us.  He mentioned it and asked "Why, was everything all right?"  I replied that I was curious as to her name since she never introduced herself and I was just curious as to whom had served us.  Funny, I still cannot remember it since it was only said one time in the whole evening.  Not that it matters now.   The wrap up...Lousy service, never felt like I was a welcome part of the restaurant BUT great food.  I liked what I had and would certainly try it again....but probably would want to order ahead and get it to go.  The ambiance and setting of home is far nicer than being treated like a outsider at this place.

It's been a few years since I have had dining at ANY Black Angus....not because I am not a fan but more so because there are fewer and fewer of them in my local area.  This week there happened to be some coupons in our mail so Rosealyn, who really likes BA suggested it as a spot for this weeks dinner.  We stopped by on a Wednesday evening, there were four of us for dinner and we went fairly early.  Sadly this is the Geriatric hour so the median age was at least 65 as they blue hairs need to feed and be tucked into bed well before 7 or they turn into pumpkins or something worse.  Our waiter was Chris.  Young, energetic but a bit disconnected and mechanical in his mannerisms, for what ever reason I will never know.  He took our order for both food and drinks and was advised of our desire to use the coupons which BA was offering.    Rosealyn and Phil ordered the $39.95 Camp Fire Feast for Two. They chose the Wagon Wheel Sampler Platter as their Appetizer to share which had Crispy Fried Garlic-Pepper Zucchini, Buffalo Chicken Tenders, 2 Loaded Potato Skins and Shrimp Cocktail.  I think that should have been a meal in and of itself but there is more to come.  Then the main dish was Prime rib and they shared a Big Mountain Fudge Cake for Dessert which taken home as they were completely full after all food listed above.    Margaret eats like a bird so she had the Loaded Baked Potato Soup then a plate of the Deep Fried Garlic-Pepper Zucchini with Cucumber dipping sauce which was too much for her to finish.  I opted for the $15.99 1/2 lb. Prime & Mud dinner.  This was Prime Rim with Sweet Potato Fries and a Caesar Salad followed by a huge chuck of Sky High Mud Pie.  My Prime was small, looking more like something on a steak sandwich but served rare and flavorful as it should be.  Horse Radish sauce and Au Jus were also offered in the side.  The fries were crispy and the salad quite large. Since there was so much food I also asked for my dessert to-go and then ended up leaving it on the table as we departed...a major disappointment on my part.  Overall it was a good food experience.  The food was flavorful and at the right temperatures and I would certainly go back.  The waiter could have been a bit more friendly and less preoccupied but you cannot have everything.  If you are going to take advantage of the Happy Hour pricing, REMEMBER its ONLY available in the bar and NOT in the main restaurant.

Fast Food is not my favorite place to dine but we decided to stop in and try the new Philly sandwich they were promoting and put it to a test.  Let me say that I was pleasantly surprised as the sandwich was hot, juicy and full of flavor.  The shell of the bread was crusty yet soft and delicate inside.    When I placed my order, I told the woman behind the counter I had not eaten here in sometime and this might make or break my decision to come back.  She was very polite, used my name, promoted the new item and then brought it to my table when it was ready.  Overall the customer service at this sore was exceptional for a fast food joint.  The sandwich was tasty and I would certainly go back for another.

Since hearing only great reviews from friends about this place, I decided it was time to see what all the hype was about.  Additionally,  I'm an AmsOil Dealer & I use this place as an installer when people who buy my product need a way to get it into their cars.  There's nothing like being able to offer a personal testimonial as well. My appointment was for noon on Saturday and I was met by James at the front counter to get the process going.  After telling James I was testing the waters with S&S, he offered my a bit of background on himself.   He gushed about hiw much he enjoyed the time working here and just how honest they were of a company.   My truck went back immediately & was placed on the lift to get drained & refilled.  There are 9 bays for service,  all of which were full....this place really is busy!   Even though my appointment was for noon and I was here on time, it took about. 45 min from start to finish, a bit longer than expected but again, it was a busy day.  Hussein did the service and was very friendly.   He also did a battery check & advised me the battery was low cca.  I appreciate the additional info and was on my way.   All in all it was a good experience and I'll be delighted to refer all my customers here in the future!!

This place has always been one of my more favorite places to eat over the years.  Last night was the exception.  There were 9 of us for very special 15th birthday party dinner for Ashley.  We also broke Stan (Ashleys Grand Ffather) out of his rehabillitation facility to join us as a family meal would not be complete without him.  For dinner and we had a slew of food, all of which was great as expected, see below.   The down side was the service.  It was just terrible!  The waitress added in the 18% gratuity so knowing full well she was going to get paid well for a large party, paying attention to us was a second thought.  There were far too many other tables to attend to where the gratuity would have to be earned and not just added on automatically.    Both Melissa and Ryan had to play "waitress/waiter" and get refills for our water and ice tea, as if this was something they were reuired to do.  Where was our waitress?  Who knew?  As far as the food goes, we had 2 trays of Calimari, Cheesey Garlic Bread and a large mixed salad.  Delicious!  For the entree we chose Lobster Spaghetti, Chicken Carbonara and Baked Ziti.  Again, Delicious!  The Carbonara was the bomb!!    The food alone is what allows this to rate a 2 star evening.  The service tore it apart and stopped any kind of positive statement to be made.  Sorry guys, you need to get your wait staff in check.    We brought  our own dessert, a store bought birthday cake which allowed us to opt out of their offerings.  They are usually quite good though!  Overall, I still love this place for the quality of the food and will certainly go back.  Lets see how they change by the next time we all return.  Enjoy!!

A short an sweet report about lunch....  This was a quick lunch with my best friend Melissa and was well worth it!!    We were greeted by the counter person with a warm welcome and when I advised I had never been here before, she took me through a quick tour of the menu and suggested what to order.  Following her suggestions was a great choice!    We both had the same thing, The Hawaiian BBQ Mix.  This comes with BBQ Chicken, BBQ Beef and Kalbi Short Ribs.  I also added Teriyaki sauce to the Chicken.  The meals came with 2 scoops of rice, a single scoop of macaroni salad and veg.    The flavors were wonderful, the beat tender and juicy.  The ribs were a thin slide and you had to navigate around the bones but it was delicious!  For months I have been threatening to stop by but never have,  Now I am sad for all I have missed!!  Definitely going back!!    Overall:  This place is a keeper!  Good service, great food, served fairly quickly....We are already making plans for your next visit!  Enjoy!

Fast Food has become a necessity with my new position and today's choice was Jacks place.  It's close by and I have not been there in some time so we checked it out....  Never have I been a fan of the drive through so Melissa and I went inside to place the orders even though we were going to take it with us....probably a better choice as the drive through was packed.  Todays choice was the Sourdough Steak Sandwich with Curley Fries and a fountain soda. I also opted to try out their Two-Taco's-For-$.99 deal.  Melissa had the Chicken Fajita Pita combo.   The counter person was Perfcta, although I thought her name tag was different.  She was courteous, efficient and seemed to care that she was offering great service.  A nice surprise in any fast food joint.  My food was delivered quickly and was still quite hote when we arrived back at the office to eat.  The sandwich was actually quite good, a nice change from the satandard everyday burger.  The tacos were a bt greasy and I would say to save this for days when you are broke or needing a hang-over remedy as they will be more like a scoop of Draino to my system!!  Mel says her Pita was great...its seems this is what she always orders as its consistantly the same and always good.  So, whats the rating??  I would go back.  The service was fast, the food was hot and the person behind the counter made me feel valued.  I will be saving the taco's for my next night out drinking!  Enjoy!!

We recently had the pleasure of visiting Wildfish Seafood Grille for my mother Margarets' 76th birthday.  There were five of all, all with discerning palates and a love for fish, two things which are hard to satisfy when in the AZ. desert.  When we entered until we departed, were were treated like guests never wanting for anything.  Our waiter and his crew were efficient, charming and well dressed, something that goes a long way in the overall sphere of restaurant visits.   To start, Matt and I had the Maine Lobster and Shrimp Bisque, a staple for me whenever I visit a seafood restaurant.  For me, it sets the pace for the evening and allows me to gage the restaurant and compare it to others I have been to.    We chose to pass on other appetizers, all of which looks exceptional, but wanted to focus on our main meal instead.  We opted to share the side dishes so each could chose something they were craving.  Brussel Sprouts with Bacon and Shallots, Broccoli with Lemon & Garlic and finally Sauteed Spinach with Garlic & Parmesan were our choices and each was unique as well as cooked to perfection.  They come in two sizes are great for sharing!  Our main courses arrived, Mom had the Florida Grouper, crisply sauteed with just the right amount of Garlic, she could not have been happier!  Our other guests chose the North Atlantic Lemon Sole, The Chilean Sea Bass, The Jumbo Gulf White Shrimp with Fresh Jonah Crab, and for myself, The Pacific Ahi Tuna steak.  What a great array of tastes, all of which were shared with each other and no one was disappointed!    For dessert, they offered us a Flaming Ice Cream Banana's Foster Cake, set ablaze tableside and a total hit! Sweet, gooey and a fantastic end to a perfect evening.    Although I have yet to be back because of my schedule, I have recommended this place to countless customers and look forward to my next visit!  When you are in Scottsdale and needing your seafood fix, this is a can't-miss establishment!   Enjoy!

The new trend is eateries seems to be a "Bread Company" in one form another.  Moving here from Fort Lauderdale where we had Panera Breads I was familiar with the concept and am a big fan thus far.    Wild Flower has a great selection of breakfast as well as lunch items, wraps, sandwiches and pastries as well as coffee and other drinks.  Try the iced teas, they are the best!  There is a sampling platter of "the bread of the day" on the counter and they always seem to encourage you to try it, slathered in a wonderful butter which is near by.  This alone has prompted me to purchase loaves of bread to take home as the sample was so incredible.   On my recent visits while Christmas shopping, I found myself outside at their wrought iron tables enjoying a cappuccino and some pastries.  It always appears and tastes fresh and has far too many calories but that makes no matter, I eat it all anyway.    My office has done lunch days here where they will buy lunch and this is where they come.  The sandwiches are amazing, huge and beyond filling.  There was a seasonal sandwich which was like Thanksgiving dinner between two slices of bread...AWESOME!!  The Roast Beef and Gorgonzola is my most recent favorite!  When my mom was going thorough her cancer treatments, I would stop here and get her a cup of soup and she did nothing but rave about how delightful it was every time!  Try the Potato Cream Cheese or the Vegetarian Corn Green Chili Bisque.    When you stop by, do it with the intention of relaxing for a bit.  Their service is great, the food is delicious, why rush though that.   Enjoy!

Over the years, McGrath's has been hit or miss for me, more hit than miss....but last night was a home run.  We had a party of 10, mom was taking the whole family out on the last night we were all in town for the holidays and she is a fish fanatic.  We had a very motivated and attentive waiter (Aaron) who got all of our special orders correct and did a bang up job.  Two in the party were little kids and the menu was exceptionally kid-friendly.  Everything you can imagine from a fish house was offered and each meal we chose was unique, fresh and delicious.  I believe that if you are in the mood for fish and stuck in the desert, this is a great place to visit, you will not be disappointed!!

We did Brunch here on Sunday for my brothers 40th birthday.  This place is busy and deservedly so.   We arrived early and did bloody Mary's outside while we waited on Matt & Ashley.   The drinks were spicy and delicious,  what a great start to our morning.  We were seated promptly at noon and Christy was our server.  Bright, Energetic and Happy to serve!  The food was terrific,  hot and as requested.  Coffee and water was constantly refilled and the dirty dishes removed immediately.   All in all, a great place to be! Great food great service great company!

Realistically, the only thing keeping the rating at 2 stars instead of just 1 was the closing of the experience.  The service was incredibly slow for being the lunch rush, especially since there were not more than 4 customers in the store.   As far as the menu goes, the choices are immense!  The coupons offered in this weeks paper were abundant and very well worth using.  The counter person was nice, used suggestive selling and had a smile.  The down side was the kitchen.  There were not that many people in the place and even if the Drive Through was packed, they can still only take one order at a time.  It seemed to be an unnecessarily long wait for a couple of burgers.   Again, save the day by the counter girl who apologized for the delay and then gave me a chocolate chip cookie as a consolation for waiting so long.   As far as the food goes, the burgers were both tasty.  The menu was so expansive it will take several visits to get through the bulk of it.  Not only your typical burger fare but salads and the connection of another fast food joint called the Green Burrito, they had a wide array of Mexican dishes as well.   A short review for me, I know.  Bottom line is this.  The kitchen service was terrible, the counter service was nice.  The burgers were OK, good enough to go back a 2nd time as maybe the experience was not the normal.  When it comes time to return, I will amend this review.  Until then, Enjoy!

As far as Pizza places go, not including the private mom & pop places I would prefer to frequent, this is certainly the better of the chain establishments.  A Pizza Place would not normally be an establishment I would rate but their service demands it, so here we go.   After signing up for their web alerts and getting coupons, specials and some pretty amazing deals, I am sold on their ability and desire to keep the customers happy and returning regularly.    Last week, I received an alert that I had won a pizza in their weekly give away so I decided to use the awarded points immediately and get a pizza and some wings.  Ordering on line is simple and a confirmation email is always sent.  Their site is user friendly and seems to offer everything needed to have a complete meal.    Getting there was fast and the most impressive thing was that when I arrived, the complete order was ready, no waiting and I was out in under 30 seconds.  Back at the office, it was re checked and nothing was missing.  Perfect.    That day we chose a Chicken and Pineapple pie, extra sauce, square cut, and normal bake time. A side of 10 wings was also added along with two dipping sauces.  All of it was great.  The perfect lunch that left me wanting to tell the world of the experience.    My recommendations are this:  Go to their website and sign up.   It costs nothing, coupons are constantly sent and its easy to use.  The other thing is you receive point-credits for each pizza ordered.  They add up and you get free pizza's for it.  Who could ask for anything better?  4 out of 5 stars as its no gourmet place, just inexpensive, hot, fast and delicious chain store pizza.  Enjoy!

First impressions mean a lot in the restaurant business.  Sadly this place is out of the way and does not get the street attention it might otherwise deserve.    We went here last night for dinner, a Sunday, another off night for me to be rating a place but the experience was good nonetheless.   Not being overly hungry but not wanting to cook either, we thought we'd give it a try.  Margaret has been there several time in the past but this was my first visit.  We were greeted and seated by a pleasant hostess, or possibly a waitress, I am really not too sure.  There is nice window seating and the sunset is visible and quite beautiful.  Unsweetened Ice Teas for both of us to start.  Margaret had the Baba Ganoush with Pita Bread and I chose the Calamari dinner.  For only $6 more than the appetizer, the Calamari dinner comes with Potatoes, Rice, Vegetables, Pita Bread as well as a soup or Greek Salad....We shared the sides as she is not a squid fan and that's a shame as they were quite good, even with Tzatiki Sauce as opposed to Marinara.    The food came out fast, a little too fast actually.  I had only taken about 3 bites from my salad when the dinner arrived.  Everything was hot and fresh and it made me look forward to coming back and trying something on my next visit.    This was one of the few places to have dessert as I generally pass on that but the waitress says they were all home made items and the Tiramisu and Baklava were great so I chose to go Italian for dessert and take home a slice of the Tiramisu for later.  Great choice!!  The verdict?  Definitely a place to go for the west siders!!  Based on locale, it might just be word of mouth that gets this place noticed as its so far off the beaten path to stop by accidentally.  I will be back, there are some other great looking dishes I have to try out!   Enjoy!

On a recent short trip to Hawaii, I left my car at Fast Track (Now The Parking Spot) for about 5 days.  It is as close to the airport as you can get without being on-property.  The rates were cheap and I had a 25% off coupon which came in the weekly mailing sent to my house.  There was also a coupon on the boarding pass which was printed at home prior to departure.    You car is parked in an outside facility, the only downside to the whole thing actually and you are whisked away in the jitney within a few seconds of getting out of the car. WOW!   When we came back, we rang the lot to let them know we were here, and they told me exactly where to meet the shuttle curbside.  They arrived in less then 5 minutes!!  Once back at the lot and in the car, I was unable to locate my parking ticket.  The cashier was kind enough to take my flight itinerary as proof of when we arrived and charged me accordingly.  How nice!!  She even game me two bottles of water for the ride home!!    This is a convenient, secure place to leave your vehicle for the short or long haul.  I highly recommend it!!

While looking for a gift for our tax accountant, we came across a recommendation to try this place out.  After parousing their website, it turns out they were doing a special Easter Sunday Brunch.  We decided to book and check the place out.   My friend Stan Reinhold, a world renowned chef here in AZ, let me know this was a great place to go so I was happy to have the reservations as soon as we made them for such a popular holiday.  Our reservations were for 12 noon, just 30 minutes after they started service for brunch. It ran through 3pm and there was not a free table to be had.  As soon as one was vacated, it was dressed and refilled before you knew it.  Its very dark and intimate, probably a great place for an anniversary or private moment with friends or loved ones.   All dressed in black, as were his counterparts, was Kevin, our waiter.  A pony-tailed boy off about 25 who appeared eager to take care of us. We started with a glass of the house Chardonnay and a Mimosa, which was one of their brunch special cocktail.   The full Sunday Dinner Menu was also available for those not looking for the brunch fare but we came for that so giving the regular menu its due, we opted to do brunch as planned.  This was NOT a buffet as are most high end establishments and their brunch offerings.  It was a set menu, with several choices.  We both had the same palate so our selections were identical.  Starting course was a fresh berry plate with a Sour Cream-Vanilla-Honey sauce that was very nice.  Beautiful fresh fruits and plenty of them.    Round two was a Crab Frittata made with Swiss Cheese, Mushrooms and Asparagus.  It was also served with a crispy Hash Brown, 2 sausage links and a Roasted Tomato half.  Interesting presentation, a good portion and quite tasty.    Dessert offerings were three....New York Cheese Cake, Creme Brulee' and something else that was unmemorable.  We opted for the Cheese Cake and its additional side of sweetened cream along with a piping hot coffee.   All in all, we were there for the better part of an hour and a half.  The service was paced so that nothing came out until it was supposed to, which was nice.  There was a moment or two where it seemed to have gotten so busy we were left unattended to and our waters were in need of refilling for a bit too long.  (Kevin, you were nice, but your stock is plummeting)  Also, the tag-line Kevin used repeatedly when checking on us was getting old...."How's that working for you?"  Time to come up with something new.  I hate to think my dinner is "working" in any capacity.    So, the bottom line is this.  Go on payday as there is nothing inexpensive about this place.  Morton's or Ruth's Chris it's not but certainly trying to get there. Plan on spending some time and don't think you will just zip in a zip out, its not that kind of place.  The food was delicious and you should expect nothing less. Would I go again?  Absolutely!  Would I recommend it to a friend?  Without a second thought.

Isn't it nice to have a neighborhood place to come and relax, grab a bite and visit with friends.  Actually, that is the start of something great when you add good food and great service.  As usual, I like to hit these places up on a Friday when it should be busy to see how they work under the pressure of a large crowd.  I am glad I did.   Last night, four of us headed over to check out TAPS.  I have been back in AZ since February and threatening to go here but have not done so until now.  Why did I wait?  For starters, we were met at the table (self seating) by our waitress who got us started with water and a round of drinks.  She was pleasant, very friendly and efficient.  The beer selection is OK and they have a fulll bar so every one was taken care of.   For food selection, just three of us ate, and one was just there to drink.  We ordered a Chicken Ranch House Salad which was more like a Cobb and exceptionally large.  Lots of great ingredients and more than filling.  Nice!  My other friend ordered an All American Cheese Burger and based on the fact that it was devoured, either the plate was defective or it was quite good....(check box number 2 below!!)  I love a great burger and will try that one next time I go back there.  I chose the 12 NY Hot Wings.....the come in a range of heat levels from 1 through 10.  Since I was not sure how "HOT" 10 might have been, I chose #6 as a nice spicy medium point.  Good choice!!  They were meaty and the heat level was hot but not too intense.  Next time I will try a level or two up from there!!  Served with Blue Cheese and Celery on the side they were the perfect meal.    If there is a down side to this place, its the music.  They have a live band called COPPER SKIES.  Their music was OK at best but nothing to write home about and WAY TOO LOUD for a venue that small.  We finally asked the waitress to have them tune it down a bit so we might have the chance to talk while having our meal.   All in all it was a good first outing and we will certainly be back.  Whether you are local or a visitor saying a the WigWam Resort across the street, it a very nice place to be any night of the week!  Enjoy!!

In my travels to the local post office, I pass this place almost daily but have yet to stop until today.  Having some free time on this holiday weekend, it seemed appropriate to stop in and check out the offerings.  Now mind you, I have never been here before today and knew absolutely nothing about this place until walking through the door so there were no preconceived notions what so ever.   When I arrived, there was but one employee and one customer.  Very spartan digs with some stock items on the right and the counter and kitchen on the left.  The first thing I noticed is the two women were speaking Polish.  Nice! Really? In Litchfield Park?  Knowing Russian (although not using it in too many years) it felt very familiar to me and that was quite nice.    While waiting for their conversation to conclude, I scanned the place for some of the items on the shelves.  What I found brought me right back to the days of living in Europe back in the 80's.  An enormous assortment of products not seen since my last trip across the pond!    When the women finished, I was greeted warmly and placed an order for something simple, a chocolate croissant.  Then to my right was a delightful looking apple tart which was screaming for me to take home so I selected that as well.    We chatted each other up for a few minutes and then I was on my way.  Very friendly place, simple but does what its supposed to do.  High marks so far.  She even offered me a menu to take with me detailing all of their goodies.   Upon returning home, the croissant was destined for my belly along with a piping cup of fresh coffee.  It was quite delicious and a repeat performance is needed!    Later tonight, once dinner was completed, we tore into the Apple Tart, the other purchase made this morning. It also was exceptional!!  Memories of being at a cafe in Bavaria relaxing and not wanting to do anything but savor the moment came rushing back to me.  I'm hooked!  Dzikuj! Bd wstecz!

My lunch partner and I went there last week after the traditional lunch rush, about 1:30 pm...not  my usual time to review a place as I would much rather see them under pressure and how they handle it.  This day was slow and the waitress was training a new server who was shadowing her.  Very pleasant, certainly cute and took our order without writing a thing down.  Impressive start.    There happens to be outdoor seating but based on the heat index, we opted for an indoor table.  Margaret had a house Margarita which happened to be on special, on the rocks with no salt.  I chose Iced Tea.  Both arrived quickly and were quite refreshing as it was 117 outside that day!!  Lunch was simple, I chose the Chili Pepper Garlic Gorilla Wings ($9.50) with celery and carrots and some blue cheese.  Margaret had a McKenzie Grilled Cheese Sandwich with a side of Fries from the kids menu ($5.00) and a cup of their Soup of the Day ($5.00)     The food arrived quickly and was almost 100%....with the exception of the Blue Cheese being Ranch (which I cannot stand) but was replace immediately when I told the waitress of the issue.  The french fries were outstanding, very hot, thin and very crisp and could not have been better.   All in all it was a nice outing.  Probably one of the better times to go there if you are not looking to view a sporting venue as the place was deserted by comparison to a late night weekend.  Conversation was easy as the noise level was low.    Monday through Friday there are awesome lunch specials with several choices each day.  The next time I head back there it will be for one of those, I am sure.    Bottom line:  Good food, great service, reasonable pricing.  Nice to see there are only 3 of these places in the valley and one is right near by!  Enjoy!!

Extremely disappointed.  I arrived at 11:05 pm. I was greeted by the bar tender who asked what I'd like to drink. Since I was there for just a take out order, I advised her I wanted to see a menu and would like to place an order to go. She promptly offered one, and gave me a few moments to peruse it and see what I might like. At 11:08 p.m., I place my order for wings, medium, buffalo style, to go. She keyed the information into the computer and advise me it would be a short while to wait. The place was not busy at all. The kitchen was still open. At 11:18pm, my order of wings were put in the pick up window. They were packaged in a to go box and ready for me to leave with but the socialite bartender was too busy flirting with other customers to take notice of the food which needed to be picked up. 20 more minutes went by. My food was still sitting in the window, untouched. No one from the kitchen rang a bell and identified that the food was ready. The bartender never gave me a second look because I was not ordering drinks from her. This is not the way a restaurant should be run. I understand completely the socialization which is done between a bartender and her customers. The fact that I fell through the cracks and was completely forgotten about is unacceptable.  At 11:43 p.m., with the bartenders back turned to me, I walked out. The food is probably still sitting in the hot window waiting to be picked up. I have no desire to go back for it or ever to go back to this establishment again.  Shame on you Zipps!

My review comes after 3 separate occasions where I have had the chance to eat here.  The first was not so overwhelming as I was disappointed my check was charged an 18%  gratuity for lack-luster service.  In addition to that, there was a space to add a gratuity as if it had not already been added....very underhanded.  The food on this winter Sunday morning made up for the billing issue.  We had a group of friends meet there for breakfast on a Sunday and ended up staying for over three hours.  Honestly my memory fails me of the dish I ordered but finishing it was not a problem as it was quite good.  In fact, everyone there was happy if not impressed with their choices.   The 2nd venture there was with my best friend Melissa.  We were limited on time and called ahead for our lunch to be eaten there.  When we walked in, sure enough, our food was waiting for us on the table, covered with foil to keep it hot.  Simple lunch specials but delicious nonetheless.  Mel and I we quite impressed they took the time to follow through with the order , get it right, keep it hot and make us feel so valued when in fact they had no idea who was coming to dinner.  Two very enthusiastic thumbs up for the service!  Visit #3 was again with Melissa and also for lunch.  This time we were not so hard pressed to get out of there so we were able to relax a chat up the place.  Very simpleton in the decor department but I am not there to be impressed with a pretty picture.  Does the food taste authentic and would I eat there again....these are the real questions.    The answers are YES and YES!  Delicious, hot, reasonably fast and a place I will be going back to soon.  The lunch specials are cheap, filling and worth a repeat visit!  Comparing it to some other Mexican places in the immediate area, this one is one of the betters ones, hands down.   Enjoy!

I stopped in at the recommendation of a friend. Sounded good so I thought I'd give it a try. It must have been somewhere between lunch and dinner when I got there as the place was barren. Clean, not too large, and I was greeted as I walked in the door. High marks for that. The menus are high tech and on digital TV screens above your head. The cashier / owner gave me a moment to figure out what I wanted. Not being too hungry, I chose a Greek salad and some Greek fries. Both were delicious! Ordering to-go or to stay I made the assumption it would all be packaged the same, but I was wrong. Since I dine in, my food was brought to my table on China with metal silverware. It was unexpected and quite nice. I'm definitely going to go back for something more meaty. I highly recommend you do the same! Enjoy!

We recently went here for a high School get together with about 40+ people on a Friday night, my usual review night. They were informed of our intentions and gave us a room dedicated to our  group.  We gathered at 5pm, the crown drifting in over the course of an our or so.  There were lots of chips and salsa in squeeze bottles.  The salsa was actually the best part of the night.  It was hot enough without being overbearing and the chips were fresh and in a big enough basket we were not dependent on our disappearing waitress to have them replenished.    It took quite a while to get the waitress to take our drink orders and even longer for the dinner order to be placed and eventually served.  There were only two waitresses, one of which was elsewhere most of the time as the other was running her tail off.    Sadly, we were sitting with our backs directly against the entry to the kitchen and there was lot of noise.  This added to the clumsiness of the staff who dropped multiple plates on the floor and shattered glass and food all over the backs of our legs as they came out of the kitchen.  As if it took long enough to get one meal out, now add this to they delay.    Once our food finally arrived, about 1 hour and 45 minutes into the time there,  it was a sad disappointment at best.  Phil ordered a Chimichanga which looked like it was deep fried in dirty oil for 3 times the normal cooking time.  It was so dark brown it looked like it was covered in Mole'.  Rosealyn's Cheese crisp was anything but crisp, more like it was soaking in an oil bath before arriving at the table.  My Green Chicken Enchilada's were seemingly tasty at first but I paid for them in the bathroom the following day for hours on end as they ran through me like a scoop of Draino.  I love Mexican food and can handle the hottest but his recipe's did me in.    Getting the check was another delay.  It was 8pm when we finally got out of there, not a moment too soon.  The bottom line here is it was good to see and meet some new and old friends but I would have rather done it somewhere else.  The restaurant was ill-prepared for our arrival, the food was sub standard and the after effects were more like a visit from Montezuma, something I would prefer to do without.  Sorry Raul, your just not cutting it.

It's about time for Goodyear, AZ. to get a restaurant which scores high marks across the board!  My experience is now three visits deep and have traversed multiple levels of the restaurant and can truly offer it  5 star rating!  Believe it people, this place is the ticket!  My review is based on three separate visits offering a greater insight to their operations and a broader picture of what they are capable of doing.  Formerly McGrath's Seafood house, there has not been an overwhelming amount of a makeover needed to get the place up and running.  Great for Paul Fratella and Anthony Guerriero who are the brains behind the operation!   Our first trip was last week for Sunday dinner.  We arrived during their initial happy hour which is from 2-7 daily and decided to dine off of the discounted menu since it was so appealing looking.    We started off with a glass of their house Chardonnay and a Caballeros Cocktail, their version of the famous Hurricane.  The wine was surprisingly good and for only $3, it was the deal of the day.  The Caballeros was smooth and refreshing, reminding me of being back in Key West having cocktails at Mallory Square at sundow.  Too many of these and I would have had to take a cab home!   We snacked on a Cheese Burger & fries, a Fish Sandwich as well as some chips and dips.  Their pricing is quite low for all that was offered and filling to boot.    Our server was delightful and a real treat.  She was quite busy that might yet barely missed a beat when it came to her attentiveness.  She seemed knowledgeable about most of the foods items and was able to make suggestions along the way.    Following the meal, the manager offered us a tour of their facilities sharing the company vision and we were most impressed.    Based on this experience, my co workers decided to try out the incredible deals on lunch items.  The specials are all $5 and the variety is enough to keep us coming back.  Turkey Club sandwiches, Fish Sandwiches, Cesar Salad and Beer Battered fish along with some Baked Potato Soup.  We called it in and it was ready when we arrived.  They must are seemingly still new at getting their to-go orders together as there were some items missed.  Nothing that we could not live without, but things like plastic-ware, condiments and napkins. All in all it was still a well packaged lot and everyone at the office enjoyed it thoroughly!  This morning we round out visit #3 for their Sunday Brunch.  It runs from 9-2 and believe me, you will not go away hungry!  We were graciously greeted at the door and seated immediately.  Our server was Sarah and was bright and welcoming from the very moment we arrived.  She told us about the Mimosa & Bloody Mary Bar which was $2 a glass so we started out with a nice Mimosa.  Sadly the OJ tasted a bit like frozen, but it was still delicious.  Sarah invited us to begin with the buffet when ever we were ready.  Once were received our drinks, it was off to the feast.    The primary food line has an expansive array of breakfast items to chose from.  Perfectly poached eggs topped the Eggs Benedict.  There were Scrambled Eggs, Home Fries, Plump Sausage links, Crisp Bacon as well as Biscuits and Gravy.  There was also a wonderful Macaroni and Cheese, Chicken Paella, a Waffle station and Carving station with a huge slab of roasted pork.  Across the aisle was an Omelet station where the selection of ingredients was seemingly endless.  The Omelet Chef was friendly and working two pans at a time so the wait was limited.   From there, our next trip took us through the restaurant to the seafood station which included Peel and eat shrimp, mussels and Snow Crab Clusters.  There was cocktail sauce as well as fresh lemons, all of it very inviting.  In front of that set up was the Mimosa and Bloody Mary Bar.  You have got to do the Bloody Mary's!!  The supplies to complete the perfect drink are all there!  Worcestershire sauce, Horse Radish, Gigantic Olives and a huge supply of all different hot sauces!  Well done!!  The last station visited was the dessert table.  It included fresh fruits, pastries, breads and muffins.  There was a fresh baked apple pie, amaretto Cheese Cake and a creamy & delicious Chocolate tart served in a aperitif glass that was to die for!  The morning was a huge success and this, by the way, was only their 2nd Brunch event!    Impressive?  Yes!  Room for improvement?  Always.  Nothing is flawless from the get-go.  Would I recommend this place?  ABSOLUTELY!  Adults $20, Kids 12 and under $8.  Don't miss out on this!  Enjoy!!

My buddy Andre Ironwing told me about this place so we met there last night for dinner.  Not knowing it was closing within the hour, we were the last of the customers to roll through the place before shutting down.  Since I have never been here, it took a moment to go through the lengthy menu but I finally decided on the Rib Platter.  1 rib shy of a 1/2 rack and it comes with 2 sides and a dinner roll.  I opt'd for the Mac-n-Cheese and the Cheesy Creamed Spinach.    My cashier was concerned that my ribs were not up to par as they were the last of the batch for the day and he offered me something else as he did not want my first experience to be unmemorable.  I chose to stick it out as they did look great but the bottom line would have been the taste.  Let me tell you, they were great!!  I grabbed a cub of the Hot BBQ sauce to slather them in and did not not need it once. They were fall off the bone delicious!  When I finally did sop up some of that wonderful sauce, I was blow away by its flavor.  Hot but not overwhelming, sweet but not too much.  It was perfect!  The side dished as well were just right.  Mac-n-cheese was wet and saucy, not dried out.  The spinach was a bit over processed and almost like it had been pureed.  I felt it could have used a few more larger pieces of the greens as opposed to a baby food consistency but delicious, nonetheless.   When we were finished, I could feel the heat from the BBQ sauce catching up with my taste buds and needed something sweet to finish off the meal.  Well, they have the answer, FREE Soft Serve!!  Awesome!    Before leaving, I went back over to tell the cashier of my experience and also to know where he was in the organization as he acted like an owner with his concern for my meal.  Turns out, his name is Devon and he is only the assistant Manager.  I would have sworn he owned the place the way I was taken care of last night!    Bottom line: This place is great.  Cost is reasonable, food is terrific and the customer service is over the top!  I highly recommend it!   Enjoy!

It's been a while since my last visit to a Native store and tonight gave me reason to assure its another long while before I'll be coming back.   I've been craving wings all week so when I passed this place, it was perfect timing and meant to be. My choice of seating was at the bar, since I was alone. The bar tender, George, while polite, reminded me of a recently released inmate with his teardrop tattoo and over use of the phrase "Boss-Man" to each patron.   My food was delivered by a runner, who repeated my order out loud to assure it was correct while placing it in front of me. I should have taken a picture of the plate as it appeared the chef was saving the Honey Haberñero sauce for someone else's order. These wings were Sahara Desert dry.  Not only dry but extremely over cooked. The celery appeared as if it had been used by an angry sous chef as there was not one piece which did not look like bad split ends on over processed hair.   Thank goodness for the luck of a random stranger at the bar to talk to and a nice glass of tea to wash it all down.   The bar tender reappeared at my end to deliver the check which was quickly paid for an expedited departure. Never once was I checked on to assure that my order was correct or tasted OK.  I'm never one to send food back and reorder as an insult to the chef will not always work out in a positive way  Bottom line?  There are hundreds of places out there I will go to first before ever setting foot here again.
