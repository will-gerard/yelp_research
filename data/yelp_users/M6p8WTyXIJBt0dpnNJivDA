Highly recommended!!! After being quoted what seemed like a pretty high price for a belt change in my VW, I called Lesueur and they quoted me $120 less than Midas! They told me to bring it right in and they would get me in right away! Thanks so much guys!! I'll definitely be back for all of my service needs as well as purchasing a new car when the time comes :)) thanks again!!

I will give this review two stars because the staff was very friendly and I do believe they are trying to run a good business here. I, however, did not have the best experience with them. I brought my car back in twice for repairs after they had worked on it and each time they told me the "new" problem had nothing to do with the work they did previously. They cleaned a belt for me to give me a quick fix but the problem returned within 3 days. I finally took it in to my other body shop who informed me "another shop did shady work under your hood". Not only would I not have known but they said it also wouldn't have passed emissions the next time I went in. So now I have paid we fix it close to $350 in repairs and have to pay my other shop an addition $200 to have it fixed with the correct part. Pretty disappointing.

I am doing an updated review because the owner, Andreas, has been nothing but exceptional since I posted my poor review. Turns out, it was an issue with a previous employee and he had no idea what had gone on with my car. After doing extensive research, he got to the bottom of the problem and offered to do whatever he could to resolve the situation. It was such a relief to know he had my best interest in mind. Thanks again.

Great sushi at a great price! I ordered carry out and it was still great. They were also offering 10% off all orders to celebrate their anniversary. Such a nice surprise! I'll be coming back again as I work right down the street!

Tried Sugar Me Wax today for the first time and I can't imagine ever going anywhere else! Lex did a great job on my Brazilian and made me feel super comfortable throughout the entire appointment. I highly recommend Sugar Me Wax! They also offer a monthly membership program that cuts down on the cost per wax. Simply amazing!
