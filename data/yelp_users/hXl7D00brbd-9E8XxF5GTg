Stay elsewhere. There are some great places to stay in and around Phoenix, however this is  not one of them. The hotel and warn and very out dated. The carpet in the guest rooms is disgusting. The ceilings in the bathroom look deplorable. Restaurant staff in the afternoon and evening would rather not be bother by guest ordering food. It's just too much trouble I guess? All rooms have exterior doors and walk by room windows so keep the curtains drawn. The place feels like an old run down Days Inn. There are two positives. The front desk staff is helpful, and the breakfast selection is great.

Relaxing and absolutely beautiful surroundings. Well maintained, outstanding staff that will continually ask "are you enjoying your stay"? Yes :) The views are breathtaking. The pools are unbelievably clean and offer the look and feel of a tropical island get away. Be it a family, business, or romantic ( perfect for romantic), STAY HERE ! Exceptional.

Yul Restaurant is ideal for the invisible dinner as you'll seldom be noticed. You may spend a great deal if time updating your FB page or Yelp. Imagine a delicious looking Ravioli. Then notice the outside edges of the noddles are dis colored and hard. Cold :( You'd think an offer of fresh ground pepper, or graded cheese would be offered. Nope.

Go elsewhere.  No place to sit at all. There are tables to lean against, but no chairs?!They don't accept rewards. Starbucks sends me a Free Birthday Drink, yet this Starbucks doesn't accept it?? Witnessed several drink reworks. Go elsewhere. Starbucks tradition of creating the "Third Place" doesn't exist here. They've got their own dimension in time.

EAT HERE! Amazing, genuine, authentic, memorable, and just outright great! If it's an Original coney you're after, this place will exceed your expectations by far. The best tasting coney dogs, hand cut French fries, Vernors, and get this; Faygo Red Pop in glass bottles! It's a dream I tell ya! I bought the T-Shirt!
