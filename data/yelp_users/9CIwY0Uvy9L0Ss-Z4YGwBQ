With knowledge of Cheuvronts past, I expected much more.  I ordered the vegetarian Ravioli, which was not available anymore, and was presented with a Risotto cake, accompanied by sauteed mushrooms and asparagus with a phenomenal pea sauce.  The pea sauce was phenomenal, the rest, I could have fed to my dog.  I would have sent the dish back, however the bartender (who was my server) never asked how the meal was until the end.  When he did ask, after I finished my meal, I responded "it was quick".  Value, not a good one, taste, not so good.  Will I go here again?  Yes, I do believe every restaurant deserves a second chance.

Why go anywhere else when you can come to the fantabulous, wonderous Eggery.   I've been a local patron for almost 14 years, and it's always consistent.  All of the employees are fantastic, and the host's, who could ask for more.  If you're in the mood for down home, good, well thought out Breakfast items, don't choose anywhere else.    I love this place, and hope that you do too!

Mediocre  at best for food, service was absolutely atrocious!  Will not go back.  Don't get the James Beard nomination, it was nothing spectacular.

I give this four stars because the Vegetarian Burger is phenomenal!  Period, end of story.  I honestly have woken up from a deep sleep and crave this burger!  Service, meh!  The burger keeps bringing me back.  Keep up the good work, on the burger!  Work a little harder on pleasant and wanted customer service.

Full on local bar.  You can watch a show if you want, or sit and enjoy your own company with good people conversing with you.

Staff = excellent, food = beyond excellent, drinks = beyond excellent, parking...  just like Postinos.   hate it!  But, what?  I'll be back..  The parking I can get over for service and food and drinks like St. Francis serves.  Amen!

Wednesday night.  8:30 pm, no clear entrance to the restaurant..  Found a way in, asked an employee if they were still open, didn't see anybody.  She said "yes, til 10".  Offered no assistance.  I waited for the host to arrive.  Flippant attitude, disgust ensued.  10-15 minutes later a waiter arrived who couldn't have cared less that I was human.  I ordered a drink and an entree.  I got both at the same time.  I would have expected this service at Taco Bell, and quite honestly, I wish I had gone to Taco Bell, as what I ordered wasn't as good as what I could get at the fast food restaurant.  My suggestion:   Stay as far away at this less than worthy restaurant.  Blech on all accounts.  No, double blech.....

I've given this place all the shots that I can.  Twice before, I've experienced bad service and mediocre food at best.  This time, meh, service was meh, food was atrocious.  I've had a better salad at McDonald's.  Three times was supposed to be the charm, and maybe it really is.  I won't be going back, and that's the good thing.

I sit here, bored, reading reviews of places I want to go, and realized that I haven't reviewed Tuck Shop myself.  It's Monday, and the only thing I can think of is having dinner at Tuck Shop again.  But alas, they are closed on Mondays!  Argh!   Regardless, visions of cheese curds dance in my head, and the smell and taste of the fragrant and fresh salads tickle my fancy still.  The service is unparalleled in the central Phoenix area, parking is ample, and OMG, the desserts are to die for.  If you want a treat, you have to dine here.  Take your time and enjoy your servers recommendations and fine wine list.  You shouldn't be disappointed.

The only, and may I repeat, only reason I give this 4 stars, is due to the horrible parking (albeit valet), but horrible parking...  Everything else is fantastic!

$10.10 for Miss Vickers Chips, 22 ounce soda, and a 7 inch sub.   Whoa!   Sub was all bread and lettuce.   Skimpy skimpy skimpy!   Service was fine, but I will not be going back when I can go to Subway for a 12 inch sub plus drink and chips for $7.00  .   Sorry Jersey Mike, but yous no good.

It's 1100 at night.  Got here at 1050pm.   Late night menu until  12.    No service.    Hit in the foot by waiter /cocktailer.  No service.  Period.    Still waiting.   Love this place for brunch, service is atrocious at night.   Still waiting.  I will come back.   But not at night.  Still waiting.   1148.
