I am going to start off by saying I am an egg roll snob and they got 4 stars alone on that yum! The location is a Little scary I'm not gonna lie but once you get in it is very cute. The service was great I was a little nervous when we walked in and no one Else was there I had the sweet and Sour chicken and my boyfriend had the Duck, My chicken was very tasty as far as the duck the skin was good and crispy but to greasy for the actual meat and would not really recommend that but the egg rolls and sweet and sour sauce were out of this world I can't wait to go back again...

I was quite impressed very charming and kinda romantic to have a nice lunch , The service was friendly and attentive the lunch specials were good too ! The only disapointing thing is there is no soda fountain but other than that it's all good the pasties were very tasty and I look forward to going back soon.

I am writing my review based off my bakery experience here :) it was my daughters 3 rd birthday party and I needed a cake for one of her parties more of just an at home celebration but still needed something for her to have on actual birthday :) I went in and had brought some cute little decor that I wanted as cake toppers and that was no problem for them :) The buttercream frosting was good and the way they decorated was above my expectation I am very pleased and will be using them for more years to come :) ps if you sign up for a kids birthday club with your card you child will get a free birthday cake until they are 10 !!! It's a small cake but perfect for smash cake or toddlers to share with a few friends :)

So first off you need to make an appointment for David's Bridal really? So I called and scheduled an appointment for 5:30 on a Weds eve I arrive at 5:30 &/ told them I had made an appointment first they couldn't find it then they said oh never mind we did & by the way you're consultant is working with another bride so you will have to wait ? Well why did I make an appointment then I asked ? they took me back and grabbed some dresses for me to try on and the girl didn't even help I got the gowns on myself so why do we need appointment? I think this place is trying to compete in a market of giving great customer service where they failed miserably the girl told me after I was there 10 min she was off in 30 min but no rush ? So why tell me then you're off when I had scheduled appointment and had to wait very disrespectful of my time not helpful i would not recommend. If I was their corporate office I would rethink things they need to be more walk in friendly and respectful of people's time , I will give them their prices are great for brides on a budget and do have beautiful dresses but customer service lacks and that's huge for me . I'm still in search for my dress I did find one I liked there but won't purchase unless I get a discount for my experience .

If I could give negative stars I would do so . I will be contacting the better business bureau as well to file a complaint. Let's go back to sept 2014 I was excited to our beautiful custom front entry double doors in a rustic design for my beautiful scottsdale home. I'm told doors will arrive by late October no problem or so I thought . I receive a call early November stating my doors were in so my contractor picked them up and took out my old doors. First problem to arise was they were pre drilled which we were very specific when sitting down with Blaze the door order man. I figured ok I can work past this then there was a large chunk out of the door in the astrick as well as they did not properly do the recess of the door causing it to not lock or close properly ? Omg many of these issue back and forth with 2 different store managers I have ordered 3 doors all of which have arrived Damaged !!!! Wtf people do your job and give it a quality inspection before calling client to let them know their product is in. It's now end of March I'm still yet to receive my doors. Time to file a complaint and contact 3 on your side . Stay far away from Home Depot unless you want to be treated like dirt and have you're money stolen from you.

Mediocre  !!!! Overpriced save yourself the disappointment & money . I order the house special chicken & sweet & sour chicken with 3 PC egg roll . First disappointment was you can't purchase just one egg roll you have to purchase 3 @ 3.95 then if you want to upgrade to fried rice it's $6 that's crazy !!! So I passed on that I went to go pick up. As they do not deliver I got there and was presented with a bag smaller than a grocery store bag so I asked where the rest of order was the women said it's all there. I got hm & there were 4 small food containers 1 box for egg rolls , 1 box of house special chicken , 1 box sweet & sour & 1 box of rice !!!! One box for both entrees we got one small box , I was pleasantly surprised to see almond cookies a nice touch it so I thought after taking a few bites of dinner my husband & I threw out the food & I tried to eat the almond cookie & thought I was  going to chip my tooth it was do old and hard a total waste of $27.00 won't be returning.

We went on a Saturday night around 7 pm and it was not that busy at all beautiful decor and a very romantic setting, For those who were complaining about the lighting they might want to get their eyes checked it was fine, The menu offered a number of tasty meals, I had a flat iron steak and my boyfriend has the roasted chicken with gnocchi it was amazing , We sampled some different wines and had a great waiter Frankie he was very good never let our glasses go empty and had lots of recommendations for us we can't wait to return again.

Ugh this place is Nasty !!!! Overpriced & tonight's meal was inedible had to send back. I went for a birthday dinner have been here multiple time each time gets more disappointing the service is ok that's why I would give the one star but next time I will not return. There was a party of 9 of us there & at least 3 of us got sick within 2 hrs of eating here must have been the salsa & cheese crisp which we all had to bad cause that was the only editable part that I had ;( I have been to the other location many times & it's a step up but this location I would stay clear of so many other choices near by.

My boyfriend and I tried this place after viewing the resteraunt week menu and decided to give it a shot. We got there and at first the service was a little rude but luckly for some reason we ended up with a new server who was fantastic! Riley was his name, The portions are HUGE and the food was very tatsy.I had the bbq ribs I'm kinda a bby snob and was very pleased perfect amount of sauce and the ribs were good melted in my mouth yum!!! The twice baked potatoe was amazing and the fried onion straws delic, I cant wait to go back. Fun louid atmoshphere good for dates get togethers and large parties. Portions are Huge you defanitly won't leave hungry here.

If this place had zero stars I would have given them that ! Let me start off by saying I was so excited to read all great reviews so maybe I just came in on a off day? We walked in and were seated came over and asked if we wanted water or tea I guess they don't serve anything Else, Then we placed an order pork dumplings and sticky rice nasty! Then I asked if they served egg rolls they said they were out!!! they pushed their little carts around with hot plates that basically steam the food and is not fresh and what you get is soggy poor customer service we had to get up and look for someone to give us our tab so we could get the heck out of there are get some real food. It looked like it would be a great place for groups of people would not recommend if you are on mission for what you want and want to place an order but it could be a fun experience for some people.

First off this was my first time at this location and it was not a pleasant experience to say the least. We walked in on Mother's Day, no wait which was nice seated promptly. We sit down and table was dirty so I took out sanitizer wipes out of diaper bag & wiped table it was so filthy & black so this is where problem starts & gets worse. We never received our menus when seated there was a drink menu on the table covered in dried crusty food , our server came over after about 5-10 min & asked for our drink order I had asked if we could get menus he said yes we should have gotten menus while seated. my husband asked what they have on tap or what IPA's they have & they don't carry any so he was disappointed & ordered a water shortly after that our drink arrived & still no menus he asked if we were ready to order I said no you still never brought menus & he laughed & said I forgot. He brings menus over & I open up my menu & there was food that was fresh & dried stuck all over it at this point I had had enough & told my husband we are leaving if the restaurant is ok with clients seeing this god knows what conditions they are making food in so we got up & left. The health department should be notified of the filth this place has the ledge on the booth where we were seated had about 1/2 inch if dust & dirt stuck on it.

Oh Yasu you have not disappointed yet. The cute intimate atmosphere here is great along with their awesome happy hr specials. Came here for a birthday dinner and we had a ton of food & drinks there was four of us. We started off with the green beans a traditional must for starting out along with a cocktail Sochi I'm usually not a big drinker but these were light & refreshing very tasty but had hardly any alcohol I had two & two shots of saki & was barley buzzed. I think it's fun to order off the tapas menu and try a little of everything for our party that night we spent around $230 or so that included tip. Ps make a reservation for this place even on a weeknight we always do and are glad we do it's pretty small and can get busy fast :)

Good times at the Dave & Busters :) we went for a family day out with our daughter who is almost 3 . She had the time of her life . We had lunch played in the game area For about 3 hrs and spent about $70 not bad of a deal at all . We left with lots of little cheap toys and a cute hello kitty stuffed animal all for about 840 points . We will definitely be going back for more fun hopefully one night we can leave the kids at hm :) a good mix of fun for all ages .

Giving this place four stars only based off the fact when I first booked they called me back morning before appt and said they had to cancel with no explanation :( and was reached for 2 1/2 weeks later. As for the positives This place is Awesome !!! My 3 yr old daughter was nervous to go to get her first check up and cleaning but as soon as we pulled up she saw the astronaut and was happy . Then we walked into the building and were blown away by the cool setup here a warm happy friendly staff had greeted us and we're all really nice :) they give cool little rewards card programs too to earn points for prizes :) The dental asst Anne was extremely friendly as explained everything to my daughter and made her feel super comfortable the entire time. Then Dr. Jeff came in he was great and I may say not bad on the eyes either ladies lol . I'm extremely happy with my first visit here I will be back with my son next time too !!! Oh also not to bad price wise for those with out dental insurance we only paid $167 & that was with a discount we got :)

Total crap false advertisement !!! They say they offer kids haircuts Sunday thru Tuesday last 2 weeks I have come to get my kids hair cuts and they said that no one will be scheduled till 12:30 when sign states the hours in there ? The other time I went they said no one was there to do it but I could pay $20 to have someone else do it !!! I thought they had no one available ? For a haircut on a two yr old that needs his haircut every two weeks is insane !!! The brunette girl in front is always smug and rude save your time and go elsewhere.

If I could give zero stars I would !!!! First off I drove in on a Sunday to get the VIP wash no wait time I thought score !!! That was until I saw my car I opened the trunk and back seat of my car and it had not been vacuumed. Then  I started to look closer and there was still bird shit on my car ? Wth so I asked the kid do you think this looks acceptable?  he said no and said they didn't know where the trunk button was on my car Really ? I said you did have the key fob too so I said take it back and redo the wash & vacuum it out please  . After waiting I went back out to find my car sitting not re washed like I had asked & the kids said it was not worth his time I was fuming at this point & asked another employee to get the manager Now there was a huge wait I was there for a total of 1.5 hr they had to re wash car 3 times and it still was just ok but to add insult the punk kid who gave me attitude stole my lug set out of trunk ? When u got Hm I had realized this I called and was told they did not have it big shock I asked for manager to get on phone he said he would call me back and look for it an hour went by no call !!! So I drove back down there and had to have manager get kid who washed my car so I confronted him and called him out on him stealing this from my car because he was pissed he had to re wash my car 3 times !!! After some back and forth and lots of employees & customers wondering what the heck was going on the kid admitted to taking it out of car but not knowing where it had gone , I said whatever it needs to be replaced the manger was nice and wrote up a incident report and assured me that I would be reimbursed for the missing item so I was ok with that about an hr later I get a call saying they had all of a sudden found my set so I was able to drive back & pick it up . I was not offered a refund but was given two free car washes really no thanks I will not return here if they paid me to due to the lack of respect and and crappy car wash save yourself a huge headache and stay away. The VIP car wash will cost you $ 22 plus a lug set being tossed in trash by a punk employee being so blatantly disrespectful  , a huge headache and lots of wasted time & cost of gas to go back to retrieve stolen items.

Finally I have found a good Chinese food place that is delicious and inexpensive :) went in on a Sunday yes they are open Sunday's even though yelp says closed when brining up on phone 12-9. I ordered 2 lunch combos to go an order of sesame chicken and sweat and Sour chicken yum yum and yum !!! They are very generous portions and come with 2 won tons fried rice and egg drop soup & spring roll per order I ordered a egg roll too honestly Their spring rolls where better but for $15 bucks you can't go wrong and it kept me and my husband and daughter full till dinner unlike most Chinese places where you feel Hungry a few hrs later . This will be our new place it was very clean inside and the lady running the front was super sweet and friendly. My only regret is that I didn't find this gem sooner.

This is our go to Friday night Pizza , we usually do delivery but an occasional pick up if they are slammed the pizza is always consistently  hot & fresh with the perfect crunch to the crust & lots of Cheese !!!! Avg time for delivery is about 45 min to 1 hr on Friday nights. The one really cool thing I love is the have a rewards program where if you save 15 box tops from the pizza you get a Lg cheese pizza Free :) who can beat that ? So if looking for a good New York style pizza these is a great place to try :)

I have to start off with why all the negative reviews ? I had an amazing shopping experience!!! Im expecting my first baby and am totally clueless when it came to shopping for maternity clothes, I walked in and was greeted promptly and asked if i had ever been in before the girl was so helpful and sweet she helped me pick out styles and sizes that were perfect for me Im a plus sz girl and they had plently of selection, They got a room started and ask you if you would like a bottled water or juice nice touch I thought. It has 3 different price ranges average to very pricey so depends on how much you want to spend, I got my pants for work cheaper than I regularly pay so I was a happy girl :) They also have a nice selection of spa items and nursing section, I got 6 items and spent 145.00 not bad I thought and they give you a great little gift bag with free goodies. I will definatly be back again .

I went to get a pre-natal massage & facial. I started off with my facial & it was amazing very relaxing I fell asleep it was just a standard basic facial there was no extractions which I found strange but still relaxing, ask for Amanda she was great. Then I had Maggie for my massage & Wow!!! She was good I love more pressure like deep tissue & especially bring pregnant I was worried that I would get a bad massage. I was not disappointed at all. I will go back just to see her again. I have been here before and left feeling disappointed by other massage therapists and only went back because of the yelp check in offer for $35 for a 50 min massage I couldn't pass it up & now I will continue to go back as long as Maggie is there :)

I went here for Resteraunt week and I was very pleased, I had the Fried Chicken the portions are HUGE, But omg the cripsy skin was so good We had the antipasta which was very tasty too! The staff there is all very helpful with sugestions on the wines and what to order. As well as many other people have wrote it's a place filled with beautiful people and all dressed very fashion forward. Great energy and a fun place can't wait to go back......

I had my first visit here & was very pleased with my experience . I had a pre-natal massage by Sarah :). She had used the perfect amount of pressure & was very friendly & professional. I purchased a voucher through groupon for $29 it was a fantastic deal !!! I have a hard time paying alot for massages when there are such good deals through them & plenty of options for other places . Also make an appointment this place was busy & I can see why Everyone who was coming out  from their service was extremely happy. The staff was all very friendly. I do want to point out that if you get a great deal through groupon or another discounted place to remember to. Make sure you tip therapist on what full price would have been :)it will keep the good deals coming & keep the therapists happy too :) I highly recommend this place & can't wait to go back soon!!!

Ladies look no further or if you have to keep the best for last :) I went on the search for a wedding dress & on a very short time frame & very small budget i found dresses at other places that would do & someone told me about strut & I'm so happy they did !!! I made an appointment & brought a girlfriend to go with me I tried on maybe 4/5 dresses & Bam that was it the dress that every girl dreams about that makes her feel beautiful & looks like a princess . Where else can a curvy girl go that has multiple things to try on & feel great. A special thanks to Ann she is wonderful she made it possible for me to have my dream dress & make my day perfect :)

Pretty disappointed this time around :( I walked in and there was one person in front of me they ordered .I placed my order chicken wrap. After waiting a long 25 min an 3 ordered a that walked in after me I asked what's going on  & had noticed the guy in back making food was not wearing gloves and touching the food ! So I asked girl at front counter if they normally don't wear gloves to protect food aka health code she said it was only her first few days here and she did not know she said I think so ? I said well he's not now and now he's making my good gross. so I just asked for a refund . The staff was nice and the owner came out & was able to issue refund an apologized. The food coming out for others looked really good but I guess I won't be finding out.

What a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT !!! Went here for lunch and I have been excited to try this place very cute and quaint , the menu sounded delicious and the staff was friendly enough . My review is based solely off of portion size and quality of freshness . I ordered the lunch caprese salad and asked the guy if it was a big salad or should I order something else to go along with it he said no that salad was big enough . I got it to go and when I got home I was very surprised with what they call a salad ?  there were 4 slices of mozzarella which was an ok portion but there was 4 tiny shreds of lettuce on top that did not even cover the cheese not surround it oh And some rotting tomatoes ? It was not even edible besides the cheese I really wanted to like this place but don't think know that I will be returning :(

Who does not love a tasty cold frozen treat in the middle of summer here in Az when it's 115* . The answer no one :) heck this treat is perfect in the December too. They have a great assortment of flavor a to choose some low fat some fat free and sugar free as well as regular they are always alternating flavors . My personal favs are the Dulce De Leche , New York cheesecake & Snow Vanilla yum yum. They also have lots of tasty topping to add if you so wish cookie dough balls are a must !!! They have a cool little point program that accumulates points I Come here all the time with the kids at the splash pad near by and we always stop in for a treat after playing so it's nice to be rewarded for purchases :) I keep meaning to take pics but we gobble it up before I remember ;)

Wow !!! This place exceeded my expectations. I had never been and a friend of mine suggested we try it out for Restaurant week , I'm so glad we went the service was 5 stars without the stuffy feel that you get in other high end places. The atmosphere is fun and relaxing with a live jazz band and sexy bar. The food was great my shrimp was good but I would highly recommend the Chilean Sea Bass (Hong kong style) that and the banana fosters dessert was what really stood out .the portions were perfect very generous on the fish. My friend got the steak and that was on the small side but we left satisfied and can't wait to go back again. Also there Cocktail list looked good.

I would have to give this place a 2.5 stars. First off service is extremely slow & that us defiantly this places major down fall .I went here with a girlfriend and her brand new baby and my 2 yr old daughter it took them 2.5 hrs to get us out of there ? Thank god our children were well behaved, it took about 10-15 min after ring seated for someone to come around and ask for our drink order. Then when we wanted to place order I wanted the turkey & Brie sandwich minus the Brie our waiter informed me that food is pre made  & I couldn't get that ? For $14.00 sandwhich I would expect a fresh one made at least so I changed my order to the chicken quesadilla it was very tasty :) we waited around for our check for about an hr or so we were just chit chatting so didn't realize it had been that long but to add insult to injury my girlfriend paid cash & for her meal & never had her change brought out the server we finally flagged down and said could you bring our change and she was like of you want change ? Uh yeah I want my change so that pissed my friend off big time we were getting up to leave & the server was hovering around to get her tip very annoying because whenever we needed to be served she was no where to be found ?  The restaurant itself very cute & charming & could have a ton of potential but I would rather go elsewhere for the price & service. Overall food was just ok nothing special. I did check out the little market across street to get daughter a cookie very friendly staff & cookie was delicious :)

I'm writing my review mostly based on the customer experience aspect of my visit here with that being said they should really find some new employees everyone here acts and looks like they hate their job. It's defiantly overpriced in my opinion but I do understand that they have to upkeep the atrium at a very humid level so for a one time experience whatever. You can probably view this entire place in about 30 min. They have a neat 3D film on butterflies which was cool but kinda gross that they reuse the glasses I guess they steam clean them But still gross. As far the positive aspects the butterflies were beautiful and everywhere many different species you have to watch where you walk because a lot  Just stay on the floors . A tip for those with babies . Strollers are not aloud in the butterfly area which is a huge inconvenience for some . It's very humid in here so I recommend going when it's cooler I went on a day it was 110 not the best idea lol :) overall it was Fun to bring my daughter and son there for a play date with friends. I am excited to see the aquarium exhibit they are building I will defiantly be going to see that.

Little hidden gem :) I was out & about with my kids at the Az Science center walking around the grounds there and my daughter ran into this cute little Coffee place playing wonderful jazz music and smelled Devine. I had ordered a ice tea and some organic fruit it's was very reasonably priced . Emily was there speaking to my mother and I and was a total sweet heart giving us recommendations and telling us about how the coffee beans are ground there and that they get different coffee from different parts of the world. I'm not a coffee drinker but man I wanted a cup after hearing her talk about it lol. They had delicious looking pastries available as well it soon became busy for the lunch crowd so we left but when I return to Science center I will be back.

I'm very snobby about my pedicures lol :) that being said I was very impressed the inside of building is beautiful very relaxing. The options of colors are great & a nice selection of products for purchase. There are two different products you can choose from for treatments they vary in price in range if $25 to $ 60+ . They do offer a punch card program which I think is very generous & I look forward to using. The staff was friendly I went in with my mother in law & we were helped by Tracy & Kim both were fantastic!!! They have a grand opening special right now that offers a 20% off discount. They accept only cash for tips so try to remember to hit atm first . Also may be helpful to make appointment this place maybe new but is filling up quick.

I was so excited to see a new place come to the neighborhood, went in on a Saturday afternoon & ordered a cheeseburger & small fries & a bacon cheeseburger for husband. The food was greasy and slippery the patties fell out of soggy buns the fries were soggy in some parts and still raw in other sections :( for two cheeseburgers & 1 small fry it was $20 . Which if food was good not biggie but you can go have in & out for much better quality and about half the price for combos.

Went here for a double date night with our friends and had a blast !!!! good food good drinks and Great service !!!! We initially walked in and the place was packed so we dined outside the music was blasting inside so of your into that scene this is your place but outside was beautiful they had the misters going to it was not to hot out , The atmosphere is very cozy yet modern. the cocktails were made strong not wimpy like most places. We ordered a bunch of food and shared the pretzel with cheese , 4 orders of different  sushi rolls the Tk rolls were amazing we will be back for sure because of those , A great cheese board , and lamb dish and the prime  Rib French dip was very good . All the staff was super friendly and attentive and made good recommendations. We will be back for sure :) Thanks for a great date night living room

Been here a few times today was my first order that I placed. It's defiantly on the pricey side but makes such a better gift than flowers in my opinion :) the customer service is great Debbi went above and beyond for me I called in on Saturday to inquire on placing an order for Sunday which I found out they are closed she had mentioned she was going in anyhow and called the boss to see if she could make arrangement for me anyhow and got the go ahead. I totally could have waited till Monday but her customer service exceeded my expectations . I picked it up and it looked delicious and took over to my moms house she absolutely loved it made her day & tasted delicious. Will be back again soon .

So this was our first visit her for my daughter For our friends daughters Birthday party. We had such a great time there plenty to keep these little ones entertained for hours :) they have an awesome little zip line like attraction cute play costumes and toys a trampoline , etc a little of something for everyone. Make sure you bring socks there are no shoes permitted in play area ;) the owner was so sweet and you can tell she really has pride in ownership as well as enjoys what she is doing :) they have a groupon deal going right now five play sessions for $36 you can purchase through them directly or go to groupon . I can't wait to go back with my daughter and some more of her friends well worth the money.

I'm excited to see that their is a new place in the neighborhood & hope they do well. The best thing about this place is their customer service I walked in to grab some dinner to go on a Thursday night. I had mentioned it was my first time so asked what she recommended?  She recommended the ribs so I went ahead and ordered the 1/2 slab combo it was good came with delicious side of beans and Mac n cheese as well as a side of fries all this for $20 and change not bad it was enough food for my husband and I and 8 month old son to eat could have ordered more sides but weren't to hungry in the first place :) my husband really loved the sauce it is spicy and sweet I'm more of a smokey sticky bbq sauce kind girl but still was good the meat had a great smoky flavor and was very tender and the meat fell off the bone. They also had a good selection of beer they have your standard general miller lite type of beer and then a small selection of San tan brewery peach ale , shock top, etc so a little of everything for someone:) we will defiantly be back again .

I received a flyer on my front door and decided to give this company a try. Called & spoke to Greg he scheduled and est to come out the next morning. He has a great system set up for confirming appointments and scheduling. He set us up fast and came out for service, what impressed me the most is his commitment to customer service which can be very difficult to find . He was awesome about taking care of everything and making sure I was satisfied :) Thanks Greg

I'm so excited my new Mattress just got delivered and look forward to sleeping on it tonight . So my review this far is based solely on the customer service & experience I have received . First off I want to give a big thank you to Joey & Anthony they were very fun to work with and helped me while I shopped for two days they didn't act annoyed that I had to keep coming back and try it out until I made my decision ( ok I know I'm kinda high maintenance customer :) They are not pushy and make you feel very comfortable during the whole process. The prices are good and it's a family owned company that I will hope to see expand. Such a different shopping experience than dealing with the larger mass corporate stores. Very knowledgable , friendly and professional. Ps I'm in love with the amazing Icomfort pillow I purchased, if you are a side sleeper or stomach sleeper you must have this pillow worth every penny !!! I got to take that home the day I purchased my mattress and no more neck pain and much better nights rest just from a few days using it get two your partner will try to steal your pillow :) Thanks again Bed DRS for a great experience.
