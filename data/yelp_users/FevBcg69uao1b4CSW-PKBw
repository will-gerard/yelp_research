The food is excellent and the service is generally friendly/helpful. The happy hour makes the pricing a little more reasonable. We did get doublecharged for some items last time, which took a little back and forth with the staff to fix. Apparently they got a new computer system that is the source of the problems.

I purchased a localdines certificate in October last year. We ate at the bar. Food was okay. The bartender talked us out of using it since the happy hour pricing was about the same.  We attempted to go at 9pm last Wednesday. They said they weren't serving food anymore when they close at 10pm. Their hours are pretty minimal to begin with...  So we went back again this past Saturday. Now, they rudely denied the certificate. We were overcharged on the bill and had to have it corrected. The burger was rare when we asked for no pink. Finally, the mixed drinks were watered down and took forever to arrive.   At least Localdines has refunded my money, but we won't be going back to Eddie's. Overpriced for food that is nothing special and the service is terrible.

Took more than two hours to get an oil change when I already had an appointment. They told me it would take an hour. Total waste of my time. I won't be coming back here anytime soon.

Cartel is full of coffee geniuses. They really care about their product. I've also been to the one in Tempe, where they took the time to discuss proper brewing technique. They'll give you more than you ever wanted to know: time, temperature, coffee/water ratio, etc. They even gave free samples to help us purchase beans.

Nimbus has pretty decent beers. The place is pretty laid back and I have yet to see it be busy. The staff is friendly. Unfortunately, our food wasn't very good. My burger was undercooked and the bun was soggy. The manager did notice that we didn't eat much. She comped everything and said she would talk to the chef so I'll give it another chance.
