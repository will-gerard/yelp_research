I'm two for two this weekend. Nine people for lunch. Forty minutes after we ordered, our food came. One person ordered a burger medium rare. It came well done. She apologetically sent it back. When the burger returned we were finished eating. And the new one was well done. The beer was good (Boddingtons on tap) but by the time the food came it was nearly time to order the next meal. Nice enough people, but really awful service. What has happened to customer service? There wasn't a crowd, there seemed to be plenty of employees. No offer was made to discount the burger. I swear. So I've decided I'm posting at every restaurant I visit, often 5 or 6 a week. I would encourage you to do the same. If the service is subpar, let 'em know.

Terrible. High pressure, terrible job. Paid $50 for an ultra clean, inside wasn't touched, complained, took it in again, 5 minutes later it's returned still with a coffee stain on the center console and nothing cleaned in the cup holders.NEVER AGAIN.

I hesitate to write this review. I feel like we've found a hidden gem, beautiful atmosphere, an interesting, healthy, varied menu, and decent prices. We had martinis, curry, Cuban sandwich, tacos, chicken salad, and hummus wrap and EVERYONE loved their food, which is rare for us. Good luck finding the place, don't really want the place to be too crowded, cause I would like to come here and find a seat on a regular basis. And they have happy hour with good prices. Even the service was pretty good, for downtown Scottsdale it was frickin' stellar.

In Old Town Scottsdale and want to be treated like crap while sitting at a dirty table wobbling above a filthy floor? This is the place for you. Rudest staff I've experienced in a long time,  especially to get a meh sandwich. Get in your car and drive to The Side Door. Or eat at the tattoo shop next door.

I liked this joint; good beer, really interesting menu (I had a spicy dog with peanut butter, bacon, and Gouda cheese) fine prices and a really nice waitress. The time of service was lackluster, but we were outside and it was a beautiful day. Cool joint.

I rarely give a 5 star review. Good food, fun menu, big portions, interesting liquor and quick service. A bit hipster doofus, but a nice evening.

Came in with a group of 5, wanting dinner and drinks. We live near Old Town and frequent many of the local establishments on a regular basis. This was the first time here. Although there were quite a few places to sit and a near empty bar, it took several minutes to be greeted by a hostess, two of them were too busy talking to each other to acknowledge us. We were eventually seated and the service was lackluster. We ordered our food and when it came one of the dishes was incorrect. OK, stuff happens, but when my friend told the waiter her order was wrong, he argued with her, saying he remembered distinctly what she ordered. But he was wrong. He hadn't written the order down and was simply wrong. He huffed and took the plate back, remarking once again that she had ordered it. The rest of us were served, and eventually she was brought her food by a different server. He said, "Lucky for you we weren't too busy or you would have had to wait a lot longer." That did it. We won't be back, and it's too bad. The food and the drinks are good. I tipped 18% on the $84.00 bill, but I shouldn't have. There are too many fine choices in Old Town. I expect to be treated with some modicum of respect.

Stopped in for lunch on a Sunday. Place was empty and that's unfortunate. Really interesting and flavorful food, very affordable. Place should be packed. Mediterranean/Afghani food. Delightful. Don't be fooled by the store front.

Good food, tasty deserts. Limited menu and a little funky in keeping the patio bussed, but great location on a Sunday morning. I had the turkey sausage/ egg crepe. Pretty danged good.
