I placed an order for 12 signs 3 weeks ago, I still do not have my signs. I went to the store to pickup a sample of the sign ordered 3 weeks ago and had to wait 40 minutes to be acknowledged. At no point in time did anyone greet me or say we will be with you in a minute.   This is the LAST order I ever give to this company. Lesson learned.

Be sure to ask how big the portions are! My wife and I could have split one order and still left food on the plate. Great value for breakfast.

This place is a MUST! The service is 2nd to none and the food is off the chart. You will not be disappointed.
