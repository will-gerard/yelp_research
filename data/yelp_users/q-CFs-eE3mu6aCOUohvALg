I was very impressed with the level of service at this location.  I was in a hurry and had a very low tire.  They fixed my tire in record time and I was on my way.  I definately recommend them.

I have been here about five times for happy hour.   The happy hour is great because all the appetizers are half off.   The food is amazing!  I have only eaten in the bar so I am looking forward to having dinner here soon.

I stopped in today for the first time.  Joe was so helpful and sweet!  He knows the products and wasn't pushy at all.  I left with exactly what I was looking for.  I will definitely be back.

I went there for happy hour.  The chips and salsa were good.  I was a little disappointed in the service.  We had to ask for everything.  I sat there with an empty glass for quite some time.  The bartender could have been having an off night so I will give them a try again.

I have been going to Chic Nails for two years and I have always had amazing service.  Natalie is the best!  I have tried many nail salons in the valley and this one is quality at a low price.

I am really surprised that Tukees has such awful reviews.  I live nearby and come here often.  I have always had a great experience.  The food is amazing and the staff is very attentive.   The live music is great too.

I absolutely love coming here every two weeks to get my nails done. When I first moved to Old Town Scottsdale I had a hard time finding a good nail salon.  Sharon has been doing my gel overlay for a year now and I couldn't be happier.  I now live in north Scottsdale but I still drive 30 minutes to see Sharon.

My husband and I stopped by on the way home from a going away party for a friend.  Pleasantly surprised!  Great service and even better food.   The food is very fresh and authentic.   I definitely recommend this place.
