Fantastic little place close to our home. Very intimate, and cozy atmosphere. We tried 3 different pizzas and all were delicious and tasted fresh and homemade. Their croutons were fresh baked and the bread had a fantastic balsamic dressing. Our waitress comped our desert, which was delicious, for a tiny wait which was incredibly generous. Highly recommended.

So, this place deserves every star. We were skeptical at first of ordering pizza with Spaghetti and Meatballs on it, so we did a half and half with a Margarita. Both were stupendous. The spaghetti and Meatball has petite meatballs and a hint of vodka sauce that will make you want to use a fork and knife but damn that idea and fold it up because it's worth it.   They sat delicious garlic knots in front of us at the beginning that were also pretty tasty. Overall, this is a place I'd recommend highly. Just come early and come hungry. We tried last week and were told it was an hour wait. Today, we walked right in and say down instantly. We ordered a large and only are two slices each.

Of all the One Stop locations I frequent, this is the worst. The dude who is in there when I go seems to give so few fucks that it's clear he hates being there. The store is so unorganized and there is product clogging the aisles.  I went in to get more ISO-100 and they have so much chocolate and vanilla in stock and both flavors are stacked on top of the less common flavors. I had to dig through just to find anything else. What the fuck?   It's also become clear that maybe they can't move their product because no employees want to engage their customers. This isn't the gym, dude... You have to talk to people in customer service. Get your shit together.

Pretty delicious. Cool atmosphere. Great location. A tad pricy and not too many menu options but the quality was good and the flavors were delightful.

They're friendly and their food is delicious. The All Tai'd Up quesadilla is stupid delicious and their chips are solid. They have a strawberry lemonade served in a mason jar that is also pretty tasty.  Overall, I highly recommend them. The drawback that I can see is that the Tai'd Up is so good and makes the other dishes less compelling to try.

Really enjoyed their food and their atmosphere. We had a few people pass us while we waited to be seated without acknowledgement, but the wait was minimal. The rest of the service and food was quick. I had the biscuits and gravy which and the BC Bagel and Summer had the Turkey and avocado omelet. Everything tasted so fresh and delicious. That said, why use stirring sticks instead of spoons for their coffee when you put ketchup in a fancy cup?

Had the Gangsta Grilled Cheese - which has macaroni and cheese, brisket, and sauce on grilled sourdough - with their coleslaw which had a kick.   All very tasty but very much embodies the "fat kid food truck" due to how unhealthy it is. The food was quick, though and filling for what you pay for.

Very good. Not had a ton of great experiences elsewhere with Tai food, but this place is great. My wife had the Pad Tai noodles with chicken and shrimp and I had the chow main style noodles with chicken.  You can customize your level of spicy between 0-5 and we both had level 3 and that was perfect if not a little too hot so level 5 must be banana sandwich. Do not judge this place by the outside as it is small but there were a few people who stopped in while we were here. While we were here we got complimentary coconut ice cream.

I didn't eat the food but my friends were not impressed with the portions or the speed of the service. Their consensus was that the sushi and potstickers were ok but the rest of the food was bland and luke warm. The waitress seemed to be having a rough night and it may be due to a holiday rush. That said, I may not consider coming here again if other options in the area are available.

Great service! DJ and his team took really good care of us both times we had him come out! We heavily recommend him! He's very knowledgeable and honest with you.

Fired Pie is amazing. If Yelp let me write just that, I would because nothing else need be said. It's Chipotle for pizza and the mere fact that it's pizza over Mexican food is fantastic in and of itself. But it's also high quality, fast, and fully customizable.   So, this review is for Yelp. If I put 5 stars - let that speak for itself and let Fired Pie reign supreme.

Had their flamingos. They are not very good. The food was bland and the cheese did not seem like it was anything other than processed junk. Their Sriracha sour cream is also a horrible idea.  The lady at the front seemed bored and disinterested in taking orders and I think the quality of her work demonstrated the quality of their food.  Edit: Moar liek Queso Bad amirite

Great service. Delicious food. Cool atmosphere. Heard a lot of great things about this place and it delivered on every spot. Very similar to Arrogant Butcher, especially when it comes to the delicious pretzel bun on the turkey pastrami, but those are not comparrisons to shy away from. The deviled eggs with prosciutto tasted fresh and the M.A.C. burger was simple, yet savory.

Good sandwiches. Friendly people who run the truck. The Chandler is probably my favorite sandwich. I haven't tried their lemonade yet.   The Willyum is also good
