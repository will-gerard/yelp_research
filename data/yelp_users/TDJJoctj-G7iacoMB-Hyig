Fletcher's is a joke.... I went there for and oil change and they convinced me to buy 2 get one free. So my total out the door was $40. Well making this next appointment was the worst!!!!! I called everyday at 8am for there stupid same day app. crap and somehow they were already booked for the WHOLE day or didn't answer. I went in to get the refund for my other one I purchase and they would only give me 8$!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! When I should have gotten $20. The guy gave me so much attitude when I said fine I'll take the eight buck. But I have obviously can't get any help from them so it's 8$ or nothing! They also did nothing to try and accommodate the annoying situation they put me in .

Love love love this dentist office. I am currently going through my Invisalign treatment with these guys and they are amazing. They are honest and caring people that I completely trust with all my dental needs. The office is clean and has a very comfy feel! I would recommend them to anyone.

I really enjoy this tanning salon. The beds are top of the line and the staff is very kind and knowledgeable. They also have cute clothes and accessories to purchase in the front. I have never experienced it being overly hot in the salon like a previous review mentioned but what do you except when you are in a tanning salon in a 115 degree weather!?! I recommend coming here.

This place is amazing!!! I've been going here for years. They are always so friendly and remember you when you come back. I always get a full set and they stay on for longer then 2 weeks (and i bite on them all the time). They are located in Phoenix and no matter what city I move to I always make the drive 2 twice a month to get my nails done there.

Tommy Nails is still my favorite place!!! I consider the nail technicians as part of my family now and they always go above and beyond for all of their customers. I even had to wait a 10 minutes longer for my appointment one day and they gave me a discount! They also always do amazing work and will do anything to accommodate your nail needs. As for Michelle's review.. I actually know her personally from living in the same complex as her and she always has something to complain about. Jeannie is the sweetest and if you are not happy they will always redo the work to your expectations.  After knowing Jeannie for almost 7 years now she hardly talks, is soft spoken and quiet so I highly doubt she sat their and argued with her.

I love Discount Tire in general but this location goes above and beyond for their customers! I can't even lie I hit so many curbs this year I had to spend money on a set of tires twice this year and my tires run me 200$ a piece (of coarse I did not purchase the warranty.) I went into this location and they notice my recent tire purchases and gave me some huge discounts and even gave me a free tire because I could not afford two! John is the store manager and really takes care of you. You will not be disappointed if you come here!

Great experience! Heard about this company from Johnjay and Rich on the radio. Scheduling was easy and fast. I have a lot of dogs so I had pee odor on my carpet. They offer an odor block as an upgrade and I think it worked. My carpets look great and our tech Robert was very professional and nice.

This place is amazing! I've only been here for breakfast but their hash browns are delicious. If you are a biscuits and gravy fan this is your place they are huge. Service is fast and friendly. Not to mention their serving sizes are more than generous.

I would first like to start off by saying accidents happen and I completely understand that. Unfortunately Camelback Moving company did not handle it the best way.   The move started off great the men were on time and they moved very quickly. First, they broke my TV stand that was roughly 130.00 that I just bought a few months ago and is still at the store for full price. Then they dropped my only box with breakables that had about 75.00 worth of glass decorations. The men were very sorry and gave me number to call and make a claim. Since I understand accidents happen I still tipped them 30.00 for their two hours of work.   Once I put in my claim Anthony was very helpful and got me all the information I needed. Then I never heard from him again! I emailed twice and called twice before I got a response. After he finally emailed me back it was him telling me they will only give me $60.00 as a SETTLEMENT!!!!! Because they base it off of lbs. I called wanting at least $100 they told me NO! They didn't even pay me half of what my TV stand was worth AND I showed them a link of the stand at the store still.   I'm sorry but if you make a mistake fix it and fix it fairly. I would have given this place 5 stars if this was handled correctly.   So if you want to take the gamble of them breaking your stuff just know they will basically spit in your face when it comes to your settlement.

This company is a life saver! My cousin locked my keys in my car on Easter morning, horrible timing! I called this place and spoke with Scott he had someone out in about a hour.. ON EASTER! If that's not awesome customer service I don't know what is. Thank you so much for the help!

I really love this store! This pet store really cares about customer service to the fullest. I was interested in a certain flavor of Nature's Variety in the medium size bag and they only had Lamb and Oatmeal in the smaller bag. Because they pride themselves on customer service they discounted the smaller bag for me because of the inconvenience and ordered me the medium bag that they are also giving me a discount on. I THINK THAT IS AWESOME! They also donate any returned bags of food the the animal shelter and I think that is pretty amazing :)

I got my hair done by Megan McCoy today and I couldn't be happier!! She did a partial highlight and it looks amazing. She was very professional and knowledgable about the best approach to take my blonde to the next level. I will definitely be going back to her. The salon was very nice also.

Save your money!!! I paid almost 4 thousand dollars for 4 areas and that was suppose to be after their "amazing" BOGO promotion. Ya right!! I finished my 9 treatments in May of 2013 and my hair is about 50% grown back.. This place seems so great because they advertise a lot guarantees their services for life but it's a scam. I told them my hair wasn't all gone and they told me to come in because of my lifetime warranty but of coarse they wanted to charge me more! Don't get me wrong I have less hair but it hasn't even been a year since my last treatment and it's almost 50% back sorry but that's not worth 4k to me.

This place is pretty awesome! Seriously $25 for an hour massage that's the best thing ever! The massage was amazing and the staff was kind. I never got hounded for a larger tip and I left $10 which is what you should at least leave. I am definitely going back!

Love this place! I had lower back pain for a month. I got a massage, went to The Joint, and even bought a new bed but nothing helped. I was referred to Dr. Robert by a family member so I made an appointment right away. After two visits my back is pain free! You first go over your issues, then you lay on this awesome rolling table to relax. Once he started examining my back he knew right away all the problem areas. He used some massaging tools then adjusts you according to your needs. It's been months and still no problems. I recently started going back because he said he could help with my TMJ. It has caused me many issues over the past 7 years. One visit later all my headaches were gone! He works magic and is really funny too! It's also very affordable.

I had a really great experience with this bakery. I am not a huge cake fan so for my wedding I did a large order of cake pops. Great customer service, fair prices and the cake pops were amazing!!!!! I had cookies and cream, pink champaign, vanilla, and chocolate all my guest loved them! I will be going back again very soon!

I really love this place and it's even better if you're a Packers fan! The pizza is delicious and the cheese curds are some of the best I've ever had. The owner is super friendly and not only remembers you but remembers your previous order. Go Pack Go! I'm very happy this place opened!

So I show up with my friends around 10pm on a Saturday to check out the new McFadden's location because the Westgate Mcfadden's isn't horrible. I would say there were maybe 15-20 people in the bar and they wanted to charge a cover for the boys. So I'm thinking this place might be better to come back later when more people come in. So I turn to my friends asking them if we should come back before we pay a cover and their hostess as the nerve to butt in and say.. "If you don't want to pay, you guys can go to Sandbar." And let me just say she was very rude in her tone. I found this so unbelievable that she would tell us to go to another bar!!! So we did and guess what Sandbar charged a cover and we had no problems with that. I am not some customer that thinks I need to be treated like a queen but I do expect a little bit more respect from their staff... Especially since they had no business in their bar anyway.

So I decided to actually go inside and give this place a chance and ended up having a really great time. I told some of the staff about my previous experience and they really took care of my friend and I. There was a fun crowd, nice staff, awesome music, and the drink weren't watered down like a lot of bars. I will definitely we going back!

I am very pleased with my experience at Kaira's. My first time coming into the store I tried on many dresses and had no idea what style I wanted. The ladies that work there were so patient, kind and helpful thru the entire process. After leaving and going to other stores I found myself feeling the need to go back to Kaira's. When I went back I ended up finding my DREAM dress and could not be happier. I never thought I would be so emotional over a dress but it happened. I also got my alterations done by Kaira's and I am so impressed with their work! Every time I walk in that store I feel welcomed! Thank you so much for my amazing dress and the great service! I definitely recommend this store to any bride.

Great, honest, and dependable! Hired them for my wedding this past weekend and I couldn't have picked a better company. The owner was very nice when I first called and answered all my questions without sounding pushy. Tammy was our driver and she was right on time even with possible rain delays. I would recommend this company and will use them again.

Finally!!! I have been here twice already since it has opened and have not been disappointed. Service is great and the food is even better! I love their zipparitas (it's a good thing they only let you have 3-they are strong!!) I went on Friday and it was very very busy but you can't hate on a business for being awesome. Congrats on finally opening and I look forward to many more happy hours :)

I thought this company did a fabulous job! I bought a living social and the woman I booked my appointment with was super sweet. I had two cleaners for two hours and they arrived exactly when they said they would. The two cleaners asked me if there were any specific areas they could work on which was a nice touch and encouraged me to leave feedback even if I wasn't happy. (But I totally am!)   When I came home woooow was my house clean! Omg they cleaned my ceiling fans and my showers have never sparkled so bright! Even my husband notice how clean it was and he's not very observant when it comes to this stuff. I'm pretty sure they dusted every inch of my house! I had to fight my husband so much to get a cleaner and now he's convinced they need to come back at least every month! They also locked up my house when they left. Great job guys! Thank you!
