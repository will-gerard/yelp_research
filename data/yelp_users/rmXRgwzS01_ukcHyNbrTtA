DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME HERE  If only I had the option to give this place 0-star! This place reached out to me when they came across my resume online. I was hoping to find a professional job out of state and was asked to come in for an interview.  Met with Sherry who displayed very little professionalism! Red flag signs throughout the interview as she indicated that the person who I was on the phone with was "let go" and interrupting me as I explained my current job position to comment that the insurance industry that I work in is such a terrible industry. Irrelevant comments/opinions that she did not need to share with me! So unprofessional! She said she would communicate with me during the process and reach out to other offices to help find me a job in my desired state. I had not heard from her for about 2 weeks and no response after I sent a followup email. The degree of professionalism as well as courtesy is at its lowest here.  I'm guessing this place must have high turnover rates. And also heard that appleone is the lowest in the tiers of recruiting agencies. Wish I knew that before wasting my time with them! Word of advice, avoid this place as there are much better recruiting agencies out there.

Wow! This place has the worst Chinese food I have ever had in my life, no exaggeration. When first trying this place it was decent yet still below par, and now its been consistently getting worse. The food lacks flavor and complexity that you would find in asian food. I have tried to give this place numerous tries because it had potential at the beginning, but after the 4th time I give up!  My most recent stop, I found a ton of black specks all over my Singapore noodles which most likely resulted from the cook scratching the wok way too hard. These people can't cook! Unpleasant, waste of my money and time. This place is not a legit Chinese restaurant and so far from it!! You are better off getting panda express which is just across the street.

This place has BOMB sandwiches, definitely the best I've ever had in all sandwiches I've had in my life.  This place has to be on everyone's checklist for Vegas trips.  Lines are long but that just proves how popular it is and a testament to how great their sandwiches really are.  I swear each bite of a sandwich is so flavorful makes me wonder what do they put in it to make it so good!?!   Prices are reasonable and I've only tried a few sandwiches but they were all fantastically flavorful.  I would give any of their sandwiches a try.  Sober or drunk this place is a must try.  It may become one of your favorite food places in Vegas :)  Oh and the best part is its open 24/7, so convenient!!

I was very pleased with their service, so friendly and absolutely pleased to find such a wide creative variety of rolls they made.  The list was very long and took me a while to decide what to get.  Having tried 3: the Manhattan roll, Aloha roll, and Alaskan roll all were pretty good not one was a disappointment, although its hard to mess up sushi, I've had pretty boring flavorless ones before but theirs was far from it.  My sister also ordered an entree and her portion was huge, they definitely weren't stingy. You would definitely be full if you ordered their dinner entrees.   This place is definitely worth a try!

Cute little ice cream shop! Got the strawberry shortcake (scoop of strawberry and Madagascar vanilla ice cream, pieces of strawberries, whip cream, strawberry sauce, and two pieces of shortcake) and it was delicious. Loved the texture of the shortcake itself. Definitely recommend trying it! Wouldn't mind coming back to try other items on the menu

Interesting concept, its like a chipotle but for sushi.  I would give this place a 2.5, there weren't a lot of variety to "make" your sushi compared to the restaurants that you order from the menus. I think to enjoy this place you should really know what goes well in a sushi roll. Mine came out to be not as flavorful as I would have liked while a friend's came out really well. I guess it all depends on what you put into your sushi roll. I also ordered the California roll, all it had was imitation crab stick, cucumbers, and avocado. Don't order it. It was very plain! I've had better California rolls...  Another negative thing that stood out was what they called "tempura" which you could top if off on your sushi roll, it looked like rice krispies and it tasted like rice krispies. Avoid using that as your topping.

Surpisingly good, I don't expect much from asian restaurants in AZ as they don't compare to the asian food in CA. I have experienced disappointment repeatedly in AZ to the point of apathy, but was pleasantly surprised when I came across this restaurant. A pearl in the small sea of mediocre asian restaurants in AZ.    Notable dishes we ordered were the shrimp cakes as appetizers, pad thai and pineapple fried rice for entrees, and sticky rice with mango for dessert. Dessert was delicious! Of all the sticky rice w/ mangos I have had this beats the rest, the only disappointment was the portion size, a little overpriced. Those are the must try dishes! I definitely will stop by again even if its a bit far for me, so worth it when you are craving good Thai food!

Came here with a couple of girlfriends for happy hour. Happy hour menu did not disappoint, we tried some of the asian fusion dishes. We ordered the char siu ribs, the korean buns, and califlower appetizers. Char siu ribs were good. But I highly recommend trying the korean buns! It was delicious and such a different combination of flavors. Amazed at how good it tasted!  Our server was very attentive and pleasant to talk to. He shared with us a few tips before each dish and appeared very knowledgable about the menu. For one of my drinks, he recommended the Refresher but instead of gin to substitute it with vodka. Very good! In my opinion, better than the Uptown Girl drink.   We were seated out in the patio. Very cute decor and kind of hipsterish. Cute spot for happy hour or date night. Overall experience was great!
