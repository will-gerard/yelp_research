We took the advice of other Yelp reviewers and were not disappointed!!  Restaurant was full, service was friendly and the food was DELICIOUS! The pure maple service served in the can was a serendipity. Great cappuccino and perfectly crisp bacon complimented light pancakes toped with generous helping of fresh fruit.    Definitely recommend this place. Worth the wait!

Good food. Manufactured atmosphere. Insincere service.   We stumbled upon this restaurant while walking Old Montreal on a cold Thursday evening in November. That night the restaurant appeared warm and romantic. We made reservations for Friday and requested a table near the fireplace.   Upon arriving Friday night, we were seated upstairs near a fireplace even though downstairs wasn't full. Unfortunately, upstairs was decidedly more casual, loud and touristy. There was a company Christmas party going on in a banquet room just on the other side of a door by our table. Load music and shrieking cheers from partygoers competed with the restaurant's already-too-loud background music making it impossible to have an intimate discussion.   Our food arrived quickly and was delicious. We shared a Caesar salad, French onion soup, and filet medallions wrapped in bacon.  The salad was fresh but average in flavor. The soup broth had a rich flavor, however the added bread became too soggy too fast. The medallions, served with garlic mashed potatoes and a mushroom sauce, were definitely the highlight, cooked perfectly at medium-rare.   We didn't stay for dessert or digestifs, as the continued competing atmospheres and lackluster service was less than impressive. From seating to departure, we were there just 45 minutes. Not what we had wants from our romantic evening out. As we left, no one inquired as to our experience, though there were at least 2 hostesses and one who appeared to be the manager, standing at the entrance.   We will not return to this restaurant and would not recommend it for a romantic weekend dinner, especially during holiday season.

For a business trip, this hotel is amazing. I love the Westin brand, but I have to say this particular hotel is wonderful.   It's a little shy on amenities, but the staff here more than makes up for it. They are positive, friendly and very customer focused. The rooms are large and if you are lucky enough to get a corner room, you will be wonderfully excited with the spaciousness and views.   I choose to stay here every chance I get. Thanks, Starwood!
