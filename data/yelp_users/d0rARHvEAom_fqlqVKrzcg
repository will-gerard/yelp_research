I have been getting my haircut here for 6 years and cannot imagine going anywhere else!  We moved an hour away 4 years ago and I have continued to go back to Ann Gentle for the quality cut and the incredible service.

EMILY WAS AWESOME! We have been coming to Pita Jungle for many years and, although we have always loved the food, the service can be hit or miss. We appreciated the prompt friendly service tonight and will spread the good word!

Floyd's is as good as it gets!  We started going here a little over a year ago.  The food delicious and unpretentious but the best part about Floyd's is that they treat you like you matter.  There are fewer things worse than servers that couldn't care less about you.  The service at Floyd's is friendly, fast and always attentive.  The owner is usually out front talking to everybody which is really refreshing.  Nobody does that anymore.  Give them a try... you will be glad you did!

Let me start by saying the food here had always been good.  The service,  however,  is hit and miss depending on who's working that day! Sometimes the staff acts like they just don't care. Many times I am the only person in the restaurant and when my food is ready the same person that took my order will yell out my number instead of walking 20 feet and delivering it to my table. Restaurants don't get it sometimes... business is so competitive that they must go the extra mile (or in this case 20feet) for the guest!

I rarely give a restaurant 5 stars because there is usually something I can pick on but Cibo e Vino does everything right.  The food was truly spectacular, my wife had a white pizza and I had the lobster ravioli and both were simply wonderful.  But that's not why I am giving them 5 stars.  The restaurant is small and quaint with an open kitchen which was very clean.  They have added a few things to the patio that has made it so beautiful and comfortable we could have stayed all night.  In just a few months (since our first visit) they have semi-enclosed the patio and added a fountain and fireplace.  The owner is always walking around talking to his customers and taking care of them and the servers were very helpful but never bothersome.  Arizona needs more Cibo e. Vino's.

We stumbled across this place on our way to the grocery store and were blown away.  I am not sure what they are seasoning the dough with but the crust is what makes a great pizza and they nailed it. Prices were great, the owner was really friendly and we got our pizza fast and hot.  What's not to love?
