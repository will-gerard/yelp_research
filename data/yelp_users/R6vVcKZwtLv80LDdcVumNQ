I am a former student & a current Academic Advisor here at Mesa Community College. The college has physically changed a great deal between my time as student till now as an advisor.   Currently, MCC is under going more reconstruction to design more student space for engagement and learning. As a whole I believe this is a institution that does truly regard student growth & development as a vast importance. Does this always occur in proxy? No.. Thus I will say use this place as an opportunity to seek out those resources that apply to you & are available.   Student life & Leadership/ Multicultural services are without question the most under utilized departments on the campus & provide a wealth of knowledge, advising, support & relationship for growing and continuing minds.  While I cannot speak for the mass majority my responsibility as an educator is to provide you with each tool necessary to succeed regardless of personal endeavor.

Halo, is the premier piercing shop in Phoenix. I wish I would discovered it under much better circumstances. I had gotten my nose pierced over the holidays last November, unfortunately from a shifty parlor and I had started to experience post piercing difficulties.   My friend introduced me to the shop and to Anna and she immediately made me feel better about the troubles I was having with my nose and my piercing. Halo has free walk-in consultations which is a service I utilize quite often. I considered it to be a check up for my nose and I go in periodically to make sure I'm on track with my healing.  The entire Halo staff is beyond helpful and knowledgable. I have found every one of my experiences enjoyable. Even if my visit was concerning some degree of discomfort I was having due to my piercing, I was always handled with care.

I've only been to Az Auto Doctor 2 times but I've been to dozen of auto service shops all over the valley & this is by for the most quality service I've experienced.   Ryan and his staff are beyond helpful and extremely knowledgable. Everyone is alway pleasant, the customer service is top notch from how they answer the phone to face to face. I feel valued & my car is valued.   The only issue I have is that they are constantly booked & I have to be protective to schedule ahead of time. However, they have reasonable pricing and tailored services specific to Acura & Toyota type cars. I drive here from Mid-town Phoenix and I have zero problem making that commute for the quality of work & pride they show.

Rubio's is a real simple & straight to the point cantina style Mexican food restaurant. I've been a hand full of times & I haven't deviated from my house favorite the Atlantic salmon burrito. It's super fresh I wish is was bigger (because I'm fat and I could eat 2) sea food isn't always something you think of at a quasi fast food joint but the food quality is good. The salsa selection has a nice variance. My favorite is the roasted chipotle!  Nice place to come during lunch breaks.

If you're old enough to remember Cheers! That is the best way to describe Lux on Central.   This is truly a place where everyone's knows your name. This is a steezy place for all occasions Monday - Sunday. All vibes are welcome young & old. I've met amazing creatives here. People's of all walks of life. I celebrated my 27th birthday here in the reading room & they made great accommodations for me & my large group. I hosted a documentary screening here in the projection room to a large crowed & even had it open to all patrons in the house that night. Lux is absolutely my favorite place to be for all periods of chill.   The food here for me is an added bonus for me simply because I love the space so much. The atmosphere caters to everyone. I enjoy the unique rotating menu from breakfast to lunch & dinner. Excellent bar & coffee selections.   This is home away from home.

Maybe... Just maybe I've become too "bougie" the last couple of year. I recently moved & this Frys is "closer" than the one I've grown accustomed to off 44th & Thomas. Now by closer I mean you'd think it would be counter productive to drive from 16th where I stay now to the latter.   That was an  assumption I made & I was wrong. This Fry's is old & not up to par with other Fry's I've been to. I couldn't find a majority of the specialty foods I usually purchase which caused me to drive up the street when it was all said & done.   This Fry's needs an upgrade like it's counterpart off 44th. I hate to think it has to do with the surrounding community & demographics that it caters but all to often it is.

The black bean chipotle burger is my favorite thing on the menu to order (because I'm fake healthy) the chicken Shawarma is also a  house favorite I always recommend that for first timers.   Pita jungle is nestling ground for hipster food junkies and the atmosphere reflects that. It's s great place for groups and late night dates for two. Super chill vibe and music is always A-1.

Although, I try to go out of my way not to support "the coffee machine". I wandered in here while waiting for a ride..  First person I meet is "Summer" she was completely & utterly full of sass & jokes. I loved her! She took my order & we joked throughout my wait.   The interaction with the staff overall was just dope. It was lively, no one had any attitudes. I'm not big on Starbucks in general but I haven't received similar service from some of the local spots I visit.

Yo! First things first, Let me make known to you that I am lactose intolerant... Therefore I am very particular as to where I choose to indulge in such deliciously sinful delights.  Now that that's out the way, I have to tell you that I adore Churn. The "ice cream" the very reason you are reading this in the first place is... Just good. No need for me to over exaggerate it you'll soon discover for yourself. Churn has a great variety of standard flavors (you can try multiple samples) and they also have "red label" flavors which are on a rotating cycle! So, if you play your cards right you'll never try the same one twice. Dope right?   I must also admit that I'm a creature of habit and I posses a bit of an additive nature. So I ALWAYS get two scoops for the cookie & mint (my favorite) and whatever red label flavor I can add. Which is usually a "21" and up flavor! I can forget the atmosphere, which is very reminiscent of an vintage parlor. The difference? They blast hella dope hip-hop! And other fresh jams. An additional benefit is that is connected to Windsor! SoO what I'm saying is that you get a 2 for 1. Super nice and amazing staff too. If you're in the area of even if you're not which means go out of your way & stop by.   In closing... Churn down for what!?

*Daily Dose Midtown*  Me and a friend had finished our meals and had stayed around to continue in conversation.  We were sitting outside and the weather is nice today so we stayed a while longer. After refilling our water 2 times our waiter (Jesse) comes back as ask us if we could leave (is in he was kicking us out) because it was picking up and the restaurant had started to form a line.... Without fuss I complied and stood up and as I was leaving a nearby couple had asked me if he (the waiter) just asked us to leave... I told them yes.   I do not know if that was proper protocol but I must say ... I feel extremely embarrassed, appalled and disrespected. I enjoy the Daily Dose for its food and atmosphere and have come here on multiple occasions and truly loved everything about it. I'm able to separate this experience from those but this none the less is not becoming of a establishment I enjoyed.

I believe that a great experience is often times the occurrence of  many chance happenings. Federal Pizza is what I like to call urban hipster style! Everyone I seen was attractive lol looked like an urban outfitters catalog I loved it.   The staff was pleasant mostly women, very knowledgable funny & have up great recommendations. I ate during happy hour & the beer/wine is only $5 dollars everyday! & served in ridiculous sized mugs. It was grand. The pizza was good too similar to that of LGO but slightly better. Let's not forget the atmosphere; valet parking amazing pandora or spotify radio stations. I heard my jams throughout my meal. A well spent afternoon.

I discovered the stand a few summers ago. It was the newest addition of eats to the my then neighborhood. The Stand is a local owned foodie shop. The Owner is a super nice dude & he's usually working right up front with staff which I think is dope.   My favorite things to order are the chicken tacos & fries. The absolute best milkshake on the menu is the caramelized salted dulce de leche!  The menu is a tad bit pricy.. You can end up spending 20 dollars easy. Overall dope spot to go on a summer afternoon.

The BBQ Pig N Chick Pizza has stood out as a favorite of mine. I enjoyed the Drewpy Fries despite them being a little saltier than I would have liked. The Garlic Monkey Bread is definitely a starter staple. The dipping sauce made it for me.

I work at Mesa Community College & Grounds for thought is the campus coffee shop.   Grounds for thought has 2 campus locations. One inside the KSC (Kirk Center) the other is located within the AS corridor. The owner Rick is a great guy, he interacts with customers/students all the time.   I'm not a coffee drinker but I am a tea guy! & of the handful of places I've gone for tea.. Specifically "Chai Tea Latte" Grounds has the best tasting Chai! I don't know what they do differently as compared to Starbucks but the taste is so smooth, sweet & rich tasting.
