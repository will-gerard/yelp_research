This place is great! Nice atmosphere and they allow dogs when it's a struggle to find true dog friendly in the valley. Screw Dysart!!

The pazole soup and black bean side was pretty salty just to be warned. Other then that it was great. I had the ensalada which was awesome but the guacamole was phenomenal!
