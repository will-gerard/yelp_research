I'm from Chicago and I have to say Deno's has a very good thin crust pizza. Their sausage also has the seasonings I am accustomed to from back home. I order Deno's when I'm in the mood for a crispier (cracker like) crust. Lastly, how can you eat pizza without Hot Giardinera peppers? Their peppers are GREAT!

I'm from Chicago and I have to say Rosatis has a very good thin crust pizza. Their sausage also has the seasonings I am accustomed to from back home. I order Rosatis when I'm in the mood for a softer crust and lots of gooey cheese. Lastly, how can you eat pizza without Hot Giardinera peppers? Their peppers are GREAT!

Unbelievable Chicago Style Deep Dish Pizza! Still have to try their Italian Beef Sandwich and their thin crust pizza. This really is like going back home to Chicago. Very cool owners and workers!

I stopped in earlier this week and was torn whether to order the Chicago Style Hot Dog topped with Sport Peppers or the Italian Beef topped with Hot Giardinera peppers. I opted for 2 hot dogs and fries. I was very pleased with both the dogs and the fries. Kind of reminded me of Bozo's Hot Dogs back on the South Side of Chicago where I grew up. Can't wait to try the Italian Beef next time.

My wife and I stopped by the other day for lunch. The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated. The staff was friendly but not very knowledgeable of the menu. My wife ordered the Fish Tacos and was very disappointed. It came on flour tortillas with no option for corn tortillas (the only way to make authentic fish tacos). The fish was bland and did not have a crunchy or crisp coating. When she ordered she specifically asked for extra crispy. She even asked the server to take it back to the kitchen to make it crispier but the server returned telling her the cook refused and said that's as crispy as it's gonna get. I ordered the Chicken Philly which was OK. The chicken was kind of bland and the Hoagie Roll was cold. It would have been nice if it was warmed and toasted. Hopefully they will improve their cooking methods but chances are we won't be going back any time soon.

Nick's Diner II is excellent but not to be confused with Nick's Diner, both of which are in Surprise. However in all fairness, I have not tried Nick's Diner.  Nick's II does it all right! Good tasting food, friendly staff, fast service and affordable prices. My wife and I eat here 2-3 times per month.  Try the Chicken Gyro with a Greek Salad! Nick makes his Greek Dressing from scratch...DELICIOUS!

Good Pizza! Good Wings! Good Sandwiches! Good Service! Full Bar! Lot's of TVs! Need I say more? We will continue to vist 2-3 times a month.  My only complaint is; when it gets busy, service slows down considerably.
