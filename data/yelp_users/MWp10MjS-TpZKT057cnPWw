Fabulous venue one of the best in downtown Phoenix. Art exhibits are consistently interesting and sophisticated. Also a hip meeting and event space.

I like to schedule meetings at Giant. It's is large with plenty of seating. The coffee is very good. I especially like the organic milk products they use - the yogurt with granola is amazing. I also love the honey vanilla latte. Only downside - music can get a bit loud at times.

Lola's serves the best coffee in Phoenix. They roast their own beans and sell coffee beans as well as coffee drinks. The staff are friendly and efficient. The decor is cool and laid back. As an added bonus, I always run into friends at Lola's as its a popular meeting spot.

This was one of the biggest mistakes we made for our business. We paid $300 per month for what we thought would be superior internet service. We would have done better to stick with CenturyLink or Cox. We were locked in for three years to this shitty service and they blamed everyone but themselves. We bought all new hardware and even when all the other tenants moved out of our building and only one of us would be in the office we still had choppy voip phone calls and slow service. So glad to be done with this company -
