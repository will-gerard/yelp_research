literally, the worst pedicure and customer service I have experienced. The man who preformed my pedicure was pleasant pleasant enough but when i asked if he could do a nail design did not understand me.   I was excited to have a hot stone massage (which is included) in all of the pedicures. My service provider did not apply any pressure and gave me and a not so relaxing massage. also, isn't a pedicure about your feet?! He did not touch the bottoms of my feet with lotion, no nice massaging, no pressure points hit, no massaging of my calves. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER, not worth $20 any day.

Yum! Wasn't expecting this to be as good or as nice atmosphere wise. With a name like nando's was comparing it to filly bees, much better! Homemade chips and salsa. As a vegetarian I seriously appreciate the ability to order tacos, burrito, or chimichangas with veggies or potatoes! Plus you can't beat pitchers of Dos Equis! I took off a star because their guacamole tastes like it comes from a package. This place gets enough business to use real guacamole. Worth a taste if you're in the area!

Ask for Rose. I am licensed to do everything they do here and would pay her double if she asked me. Amazing, always!

Late night or 5 am food on a Saturday night? Don't want to leave your hotel room? This place is it. Fast Italian, so don't get your hopes up. Got a dinner salad though and was pleasantly surprised by its size & quality. 2 girls late night snacks delivered...$13 plus tip. Can't beat that!

The only place in the area that had decent reviews for dinner. First, don't judge this gem by its exterior, I almost didn't make it in because of it. Nicely decorated, air conditioned and smells pleasant. I had the chile rellenos with shrimp. Yum. House made red sauce? Double yum. My dinner companions had the salmon wrap (which she said was a bit fishy but not too bad) and the lazy chicken tacos (she said these were very good). So overall, yes I would come back here. We didn't have any service issues and it wasn't badly priced. However, I wouldn't drive up from chandler to just eat here.

I'm obsessed. Miso base with tons of veggies and noodles. The servings are huge, enough for a couple of meals for me. They have chili oil and tropical ice tea. Great lunch spot.

I love this place! I've never actually eaten inside because we always get take out. The grilled vegetables are to die for!! I usually order the falafel wrap and hummus. The green hummus has the perfect amount of heat. Last night I had the tiramisu for the first time and I could have eaten at least 3 more little cups, so yummy!!

Bought a Groupon and would have loved to use it! I bought the Groupon in April and called pretty frequently the first few weeks and left messages. Someone did eventually call back and left a message (called around 11 AM on a weekday, I was at work so couldn't answer). I called back same day and tried again repeatedly. Never  got another call back. Had to get a refund from Groupon :( Would have loved to have my windows tinting in April or May. Now it's already 120* and I need them down pronto! Looking elsewhere.

Everything about this place is awesome. Everyone is super friendly. The owner is really nice. The restaurant is always clean. The food is delicious, consistent, & healthy! You can't go wrong with a hot bowl, panini, or a salad (they are huge!)
