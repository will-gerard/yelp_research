Great happy hour. We sat on the patio had a couple drinks and some wings. They were great. The wings were a decent size and the sauce was tasty. Our server was fast and friendly. When I mentioned my food allergy she was happy to go back into the kitchen and double check for me, which I greatly appreciated. Solid sports bar in old town. Big drinks, good bar food, good service, what's not to love.

Horrible worst service I've ever had. Slow no check backs no refills asked for one it never came. Poured water with glasses on the table splashing ever where. Watched an employee use the bathroom and then not wash hands. Food was great but can't say I'll be back.

Let me start off with I love this place. Good food, good wine, nice atmosphere. The service yesterday however was not good and a serious bummer on our lunch. The blonde waitress forgot my drink order. No big deal I can handle my lunch with water. The waitress takes our order ask for the burger temps, we both asked for med. We got two well done burgers and my one modification of no relish. You guessed it had it on there. She checked backed on us when we were two bites away from being done. We were hungry so I scraped and we ate our dry over cooked burgers. This is a great place but I'd suggest not sitting in miss blonde's section.

Got delivery tonight. I had an Oder of wings in their house sauce and a pepperoni calzone. Delivery was fast, friendly, and arrived hot. The wings were awesome. Their house sauce is def homemade seemed to have some garlic in it. Hot enough to not be boring but not so hot you can't taste anything. They were meaty too! Oh and the side of ranch they give us tasty and more than big enough to dip every bite in it. I'll def be getting wings from them again. My calzone was good, made with real cheese, and properly cooked. It was also big more than enough for two. Good food, good prices, and they deliver. I will def be seeing them again and a again.

Order some Chinese delivery for lunch today. I got chicken lo mien, pot stickers, and lettuce wraps. First I'll start off with the most edible of dishes, the pot stickers. Seemed to be of the frozen variety and deep fried not steamed or pan fried like every other dumpling. They were boring tasting and I wasn't a fan of the outside or inside texture. Now the lo mien insanely boring no flavor one bite and I was done. Now the chicken lettuce wraps totally inedible. By far one of the worst things I've ever put in my mouth. Just gross tasting, can't really describe it but I took one bite and then dropped that bite back on to my plate. On the plus side the delivery was reasonably fast, items were well packaged and arrived hot, and came with appropriate utensils and condiments. Overall big waste of my money and I'm def still hungry. Too bad because I had fond memories of the old location.

I always have fun when I come here. I am by no means a golfer but the games are fun. My bf loves to golf. He has a great time and even with my lack of golf game I have a good time. However the service we received last night was awful. It took at least 10-15 mins for our server to get to us. We had already finished one game. We ordered one round. Sat with empty drinks for a bit. So we decided to get a pitcher so we wouldn't be left wanting. It came with a chipped glass. Had to walk around to find someone to fix that. It was replaced quickly. Then it came time to pay our tab. Our games we finished our time was up. Had to track down our server. I like to pay with cash. While I am taking out my money, haven't even put it down yet the server asked if I needed change. Rude. We probably would have eaten too but we were never asked if we would like anything and our server was nowhere to be seen. Five stars for fun. Zero stars for service. I left with a sour taste in my mouth. Train your servers better. I will not be choosing to spend my money here again.
