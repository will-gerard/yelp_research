Have went here for Dinner before, it was okay but not great. Went to lunch buffet and it's terrible.  Not spicy. The dishes taste nothing like they should.  If you must eat here, the Tandoori Chicken isn't bad.  However, if you really like Indian food, stick to Chutneys in Tempe, or the really good Indian Market with a buffet on 7th street near Thomas.

Terrible. Long wait, food was a mess and unappealing. One of the worst places I've been.

Cheap as can be. The coffee is terrible, the food is as average as could be.

Spring broke, called them out, made a quick appointment. Great work fixing it, and a good price. Happy with the service.

Love Thai Rama, great place to eat. Decor could be much better, but food is incredible and worth it.

Very well priced drinks. They have rockband which is awesome when there are others that want to play.   Lots of regulars. Food is cheap as could be, and is kind of hit or miss.   Owner is funny, and a pleasure to talk to. I like it, but it's a dive. Just a good kind of dive.

I've always had great experiences going here, I am greeted by an older gentleman who takes my clothes no matter how rough I've worn them, and I get them back looking like a million bucks. No reason to switch, and it's consistently good.

Food was so bad we left without eating. If you like these fake Chinese buffets, then ignore this review.   It was awful.

Food is good. Service is spotty. Drive through is always backed up, and is often not an option.   Time to get your food in the drive through is INSANE. It makes no rational sense how long it takes.

Food is totally awesome. The owner is great too, the only issue is that since she does everything, it's possible it takes forever to get service.  Restaurant, Clothing Store, and Grocery.

Dealer screwed up my ignition when bringing the car into them. Had it taken to Japanese Auto Pros to fix it.  Dealer wanted $1000, Japanese Auto Pros did it for $260 fixing the broken one the dealer screwed up.  It's amazing to know you have a quality auto shop near you incase something happens. So awesome.

Food is shockingly good for the place it is. It isn't Irish though, more like regular bar.   It isn't exactly a friendly place to eat, it's really a bar, but that's fine. It's delish food. The people are a bit sketchy at times.

First time I went there, I felt they were rude and quick. Waited a year to come back. Then I started to come regularly, and I am treated fantastically.   Food is outstanding. Also super cheap. It's really one of the best places to go, you get a lot of food, it's really delicious, and you can't get out of a place any cheaper than this.  The best. If you can get past the initial service.

Food isn't good. Service isn't good. Really wanted to like it, but it's just a waste of money and time.  Edit: Hi Rick, I appreciate your desire for a resolution. Not sure what to do there, I've had bad food multiple times there, and haven't been happy once.   At other locations for Streets of New York I've had a significantly better experience.

Deep dish pizza here is incredible. Doesn't get better. It's expensive for the deep dish, but worth it. I disagree that the pizza is far too saucy, it is awesome.  Wings are fantastic too.

Ordered the duck. It was Ice cold in the middle when I got it. They came by and said they must have not microwaved it long enough.  I'll pass.

Good prices, good guy. Haven't owned any suits, and he walked me through the process, and helped me to understand why one looked better than another.  Without hesitation will come back.

Delish, but they don't speak English. It doesn't look clean. It's quite strange. It's really really good food though. Sometimes I don't even get what I ask for. It's strange, but good.

Have had 5 different Air Conditioning people over to fix an issue. All of them cost more than Flores, and did a worse job.  Finally the issue is fixed, and for much less. Even the Freon replacement was far less than anyone else.  Wish I would have known about them to start, I went through craigslist and got a bunch of yoyos before giving in and just getting the best rated guys on yelp.

Delicious. Was intimidating walking in without knowing what anything was, but the person behind the counter let us try a bunch of different things until we knew what would be good. Then they were so kind, and brought us many new things for free to try.   Very helpful, and completely removed any concerns about the first time being in there. Could not have gone better.

Tried it again, much friendlier. Chai was delicious, and a good place to read a book and hang out.

Food was terrible, at least there was a grill, which was also sub par but at least edible.

Came over to take measurements for sunscreens. The guy made a few mistakes, and didn't order the correct things. Spoke to the headquarters with him, and we agreed on a reasonable adjustment. I still paid more than I had to because of the guy's mistake, but I'm very happy with the sun screens, and think they did a good job.  It's been at least a month though, and I haven't received my rebate yet from SRP.

I'm a fan a most of their food, but their gyros are cheap, and unsatisfying. Their other food is quite good.

I've had more of their food, and I just love it. I also buy their fresh bread they make on site often.  Just skip the gyros. They make them so cheap to get people in, but their food is so good it ends up displaying their worst item.  The chicken tikka sandwhich is awesome. So many good items!

New building is incredible, significantly improved. food is still amazing, it is now a place I would take people to, and not feel odd about how dirty, hot and cramped it is.  A real gem now!

Daughter has been going for over a year. Nice place, and parents night out allows us to go out as a couple while she has a great time jumping. Would recommend.

The food is outstanding. Their hours are wrong, they aren't open on Monday's right now.  Edit: They are now open 7 days a week. Increased the rating to 5, I love the food but I was very unhappy to drive there when they were closed. Hoping it doesn't happen again.

Had the Lunch buffet, best Indian I've had on the west side by far. I've had 8 other Indian restaurants, and none of them have come close to being this good.   First positive sign, everyone in the place was Indian. Second positive sign, all the food was spicy. Had to ask for a Masala Dosa for my daughter so that she could eat.  Delicious. Will be back soon.  There was a TV that was too loud. I really hate having TV on at places, let alone with volume on. Someone asked they turn it down, and they I think didn't understand the English well enough to comply.  Could be an issue going forward.

My favorite Indian place in the valley. I've had them all, and it isn't close. Spicy, and delicious!

I don't know what to say, I love the food but as everyone says the service is terrible.  Part of the reason is that the owners steal all of the tips from the waitresses. They make minimum wage, and all the tips go to the owners.   I am torn. It is without question my favorite food, but the owners steal from the servers. So I don't think I should eat here.... Really disappointing...  What does one do in this case?....   The other Indian restaurants around here are terrible. So I can drive to Tempe to support better practices for servers, or I can eat here and support thieves with delicious food.

Ordered take out, had the Pad Thai, and the Duck Curry. Duck curry was good, Pad Thai was a bit below average.  Will probably order again because it's close, but there are better places like Siam  My daughter and I call the place "Thai-Hop"

Had dinner tonight before a show at the ASU Kerr theatre. Fantastic as always, I've been going to Scratch for a long time, and Merci hits all the same notes that keeps me coming back.  Except the balsamic vinaigrette is gone. Bring it back please! :)  Amazing pastries, I've taken many groups of people here, and it's always a hit.

Ordered some for my wife to try since we love Viet, and it's closer than any other place to us. I'm on a diet, so just got food for her.  Had the exact same experience about the person taking the order having no idea what was on the menu, and only able to order via number. I asked for something, and they just said "What number?". I guess the other Vietnamese places are just humoring me when I think I'm saying the words close enough.   Wife loved it, said the food tasted much fresher than the other viet places we go. Perhaps I can have some Pho without noodles, and extra bean sprouts. Except there's no number for that, so probably not.
