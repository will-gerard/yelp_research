You can't go wrong at this brunch spot. Everything we tried was delicious including the French toast and the corned beef hash. The Bloody Mary bar is where it's at though, you get to pick your own assortments. It's also a great view of the Bellagio fountains and Vegas people watching if you can grab a spot outside.

Pretty solid four stars, the place has a long wait so if you can just sneak up to the bar and eat there. Milkshake was great, fries come with ketchup and some kind of curry --which was a nice touch. The burger itself didn't disappoint, very juicy, great bun and cooked to perfection. It's a lot of food though so come very hungry or just split the burger. I'd definitely recommended this place with no problem, despite the celebrity bits.

It's reasonable airport food, I mean how high can your expectations be right? The service was a bit on the slow side so just make sure you ask for your check at the same time you place your order and you're good to go. The burger was decent but well over medium but beggars can't be choosers right?
