Pastrami, pastrami, pastrami, pastrami, pastrami, pastrami." on rye...that's the way I judge a dood Deli, by their Pastrami Sandwhich. Well this isn't up there with Chompies (portin wise) but it sure was close. The pastrami sandwich was surprisingly good. I prefer thick, hand-carved pastrami, "The pastrami was a perfect mix of lean and fatty portions and  and freshly carved. Definitely better than your ordinary pastrami. The pastrami here is to die for. Never in my life I imagined that pastrami, or any kind of meat for that matter, can be so succulent and juicy. It literally melts in your mouth.   I got their Pastrami Sandwhich, my wife got their reuben. To go we got 6 bagels, lox spread, chopped liver, herring in sour cream sauce and some pickels.    What's good here, the answer is everything As for the desserts ... The massive slabs of Cheeese Cake was moist and ridiculously good (and ridiculously big)  FOOD:  Unbelievably lean and tasty. I thoroughly enjoyed every bite of my sandwich. oh and their pickles..... don't even get me STARTED they were  exactly how grandma used to make them and the pickles just topped it off. PRICE: Although the prices are a bit high you will definitely have leftovers for lunch the next day. CONCLUSION:  The portions sizes are very generous,  especially for the price! I highly recommend giving this place a try!

My wife and I came here for lunch. This is a great place if you want to eat healthy. It is located in the Town & Country Shopping Center. I haven't been to the Town & Country Shopping Center in 15 -20 years.  We were greeted by our waitress Rachel. She took our beverage order and allowed us time to look over the menu. We decided to start off our meal with an appetizer of Spinach and Artichoke dip. It was outstanding.   For our entrée I got the chicken Souvlaki Dinner / kebab plate, which came with a generous amount of tender and flavorful chicken breast on two skewers. It was served with rice, pita bread and a Greek salad. The salad consisted of chopped cucumbers and tomatoes with a generous amount of feta cheese.  I also got a side of dolmades. The grilled chicken was moist, and tender. I was able to cut it with a fork. It was surprisingly good. In fact it was much better than some Mediterranean restaurants I've tried. The Dolmades were excellent. Plus the Tzatziki sauce was superb.  My wife Carol got the Pork Souvlaki Dinner / kebab. It also came with a Greek salad, rice and pita bread, which she enjoyed. I tried some of the pork and it was delicious. Tender pieces of pork on a skewer marinated and grilled to perfection. Both dishes had lots of flavor.  FOOD: The food is deeeelicious AMAZING delicious . When I say "amazing". I definitely mean it.  PRICE: Very reasonable.You get a lot of food for the price. SERVICE:  The service was superb.  AMBIANCE: Low key, nothing fancy, but comfortable.   CONUSION: If you're looking for a fancy restaurant with fancy service...then forget it. If you are looking for amazing Middle Eastern food and absolutely friendly service...welcome home. What a wonderful experience. RETURN  FACTOR: 100%  ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************  5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business.

My wife & I stopped here today. They were not very busy. The other day (on the weekend) we went by the store while we were out & about and the parking lot was packed.  I forgot how much I enjoy exploring Big Lots merchandise and looking for closeout bargains.  This place has everything from food to kitchenware, utensils, dishes, pots & pans, flatware, electronics, decorations to furniture. ALL at bargain basement prices.    ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ******************** 5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business.

Dr. Nick Warner is awesome. His treatment space is clean, quiet. Dr. Warner  is pleasant, respectful and very rofessional. I wish I could give him 6 stars.  Dr. Warner observes an obvious  knowledge of advanced anatomy, physiology, kinesiology, and chiropractic.   He is strong and gives great adjustments, utilizing a soft tissue technique called Trigger Point Therapy prior to adjusting. He knows how to "melt knots" and find those troubled spots. It's obvious that he enjoys teaching when going over the symptoms, what he's doing, why he's doing it,, and what you can expect both during the session, and afterward.  He is intuitive, which is very important in someone who is a bodywork healthcare professional.  It's obvious that he is educated well in his craft. He is compassionate and a fantastic listener and gets down to the nitty gritty. The best part is he genuinely wants to find the root of the problem and fix it.   Dr Warner is hands down my top choice for chiropractic care in Phoenix. What I really like about Dr. Warner is he  prioritizes patient healing and independence, and his treatment plans are effective and efficient.  You will not spend years going to his office three times per week, because he truly wants to see his patients get better and go on to do all the things they love to do.  To this end, Dr. Warner offers exercises, stretches and other lifestyle modifications to his patients so they can continue their healing outside of his office.  I highly recommend him to anyone who is looking for a fantastic chiropractor.  I wouldn't consider going to any other chiropractor.

I'm a sucker for old saloons and cool bars.  Been going to the Wagon Yard on and off throughout the years ever since since my wife & I moved here 29 years ago. My wife goes there every Friday night for Karaoke and I go with her on occasion.  Although I've been here many times I never reviewed the Wagon Yard. So where do Ibegin with this place?  To start honestly the Wagon Yard is not going to be everyone's bag. At first glance the menu is fairly standard for a country western saloon. What I like about the' Wagon Yard is they get a nice mx of people not just a western crowd.  They have a harty breakfast menu, a nice selection of sandwiches for lunch and sevreal dinner specials. None of which are pricey. Everything is very reasonalbe there.  My wife normally orders either the mini chef salad with ham. Why because the regular chef's salad with ham & turkey is huge. Even the mini chef salad is more than enough for one person. If she doesn't get the mini checfs salad she will order one of their burgers. She says they are always made to perfection & taste good.   For me I think over the years I've tried everything on their menu. My favorite is the liver & onions. Just make sure they don't over cook it. If done correctly it is FREAKING PHENOMINAL. in fact I'm salivatng thinking about it right now. :-)   CUSTOMER SERVICE: SERVICE: Our waitress normally is DJ she is Super (super) friendly and always accomodating.  FOOD: The food isn't out of this world phenomenal, but they do have decent prices and okay portion size. AMBIENCE: This is not a fancy place and they even have a pretty decent size dance floor where we can only imagine the amount of line dancing going on. CONCLUSION: Been coming here for 29 years why stop now. Overall rating of either a 3.5 or a 4

Came here on 12/16/2013 for a Christmas Party. There was 32 of us at he event. We had three selections to choose from off the menu. Chicken Alfredo, Pork Chops and grilled Salmon.   Considering there was 32 of us the service we received from  our waitress was absolutely outstanding. She put pitchers of water and ice tea out for us in addition to pots of hot coffee.   My choice of an entrée was the grilled salmon. It was perfectly cooked. Tender flaky and tasty. It came with rolls & butter, A house salad, wild rice and green beans. Everything was delicious.   My wife ordered the pork chops. They also am grilled. Carol had me try a bite. The pork was succulent. It wasn't dried out and was very tasty. Not at all what I was expecting. The dish came with rolls, apple sauce & broccoli.    FOOD: Everything was cooked the way it should be. SERVICE: Absolutely superb.  PRICE: Prices were a bit high. AMBIANCE: Nice clean environment. CONCLUSION:  RETURN FACTOR100%.         ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************  5 stars -Highly recommended.

Can we just talk for a minute about how friggin' good this restaurant is? This place serves plenty of fresh dim sum, has fast service and easy to get in if you come early!  But be warned, we have come just as the doors opened only to miss out on some of the choices when they get busier, so your timing to arrive will influence your choices. What's good about dim sum is that each dish is inexpensive and you can sample a variety of food. C-Fu is always pretty busy but you don't normally wait long to be seated.  This place a good spot for decent dim sum.  They are fast, effective, and your dim comes out nice and steamy.  Service for us was OK,  then again, Chinese restaurants aren't always known for having the best service.  Could I tell you the exact name of our favorites?  No. but their food is amazingly tasty, and fresh! Plus the carts actually come by frequently.  The food is delicious and remarkably affordable!  I haven't been to any other dim sum restaurant here in Arizona, so I can't compare to others, but this once is delicious. The restaurant was nice and spacey    "the food really good" but "I can't remember the name of it",   Excellent choice for Dim Sum.  Busy place, which keeps the food fresh and the carts moving.  Very reasonably priced, as dim sum should be.   They normally don't serve you, they are usually just there to refill your drinks and give your receipt.  Other than that, they go around with carts and you pick & choose what you want.    FOOD: The food was really good. Unfortunately I can't remember  any of the dishes we enjoyed but we did try a variety of their selections.  We didn't like everything on the menu.  But there were lots of things my wife & I really liked. PRICE: Reasonable. SERVICE:  The carts come around quite frequently which is a good thing. Service is somewhat lacking when it comes to getting drink refills.  I had to constantly flag down a waiter to refill our beverage. Also our servers hardly spoke a word of English.  On a good note while the restaurant was packed, we were seated right away  CONCLUSION: My thoughts on a restaurant of any ethnicity is seeing who eats there, if you see many people from the ethnicity of food you looking for you are usually on the right track this place in that aspect does not lie.  RETURN  FACTOR: 100%. I would come back here when I crave for some dim sum.     ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************  5 stars -Highly recommended.

My wife, our grandson Michael, our friend Kathy R. and I went here lunch a while ago and I forgot to submit a review so this is long overdue.   I'm from Rhode Island-born and raised--and have had pizzas from authentic Italian mom and pop pizza joints so admittedly, I am hard to please when it comes to Italian food.   This pizza is good: perfectly greasy, cheesy, chewy,  gorgeous, flavorful and is always piping hot, very fresh, and the cheese and sauce are excellent quality. While Ray's isn't the best pizza I ever had it was to my likings. I do appreciate a good pizza.   Some people may think  "pizza is pizza," but you'd be wrong. It is hard to find a real good pizza in Arizona especially because I was raised back east and have had some great pizza.  One of the more expensive pizza restaurants in town. In addition they don't have delivery.  It's good pizza! But not mind-blowing. The crust is actually super fantastic.  FOOD:  It wasn't the best pizza I have ever had in Arizona but it's right up there in the mix. The pizza was a typical New York style pizza, nothing special although the pizza is always piping hot, very fresh, and the cheese and sauce are excellent quality. CONCLUSION: I didn't think it was anything special as far as taste / flavor goes. The ingredients of the pizza tasted fresh and I believe it was of high quality. Good pizza, but not as good as some. Their pizza is between OK and I'm-a-fan-  RETURN FACTOR: 100%]  ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************  5 stars -Highly recommended.

After attending a meeting tonight nine of us went to the Golden Dragon for dinner. They serve  "American Chinese food". Everyone got something different and everyone agreed the food here was outstanding.   Here is my take on this place....I always start my meal with the soup. If the soup is  is good usually the food is good as well. Tonight was no exception. The Wor Wonton soup was excellent!   In addition to my soup I got a vegetable dish. The sauce on it was superb.   Everyone commented how their entrée had good flavors, was served hot and the ingredients used seemed fresh. No one was disappointed with what they got.     prepared perfectly. The food here is great and while it isn't 100% authentic it's very filling, not expensive, had large portions, was served fast and every dish was delicious. I can't emphasize enough how inexpensive it is!    ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************  5 stars -Highly recommended.

There was 9 of us in our group. We went here after our weekly Thursday meeting, Normally we go (when we go) for Mexican food to another restaurant but we all wanted a different Mexican food establishment this time around. If you have read my reviews about Mexican food restaurants I always start with how the salsa tasted to me and then go from there. The salsa was a combo of other places hot and mild chunky salsa so it was OK but the chips were served hot and added that "little" extra that marked their salsa & chips right there with some of the best.  Now to the food: My dish was the Fajitas de Macayo. A flavorful treat of steak Fajitas grilled to perfection on top of  a bed of grilled onions and green chiles. Served with sour cream, guacamole, shredded cheese, Pico de Gallo, and refried beans. I asked our server (waitress who's name  I didn't  get) if I could get a side of grilled vegetables instead of the  refried beans. She said no problem so I substituted the  refried beans for a side if grilled vegetables. I expected I would be getting grilled onions, and the other grilled vegetable that came with the meal but instead got grilled zucchini, squash, broccoli and some other grilled veggies. But it was all good just not what I expected.  My wife got a como plate of Shredded Beef Enchilada &  a Shredded Beef Taco served with refried beans  she really liked the Taco and next time wouldn't get the Shredded Beef Enchilada. all in all she liked what she picked out.  FOOD: Everyone in our party liked what they ordered. AMBIANCE/ DECORE: typical modern Mexican restaurant décor .clean interior. SERVICE: Outstanding. Especially considering every had something different . they provided excellent customer service.  CONCLUSION: Very filling meals. This restaurant is spotless. The prices are excellent. What else do you want from a Mexican food restaurant. I'm sure we will be back RETURN FACTOR: 100%   ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************  5 stars -Highly recommended.

There was three of us in my party including me. We went during the afternoon on a  Friday and we all ordered the Fish & Chips. All of the food we ordered was absolutely Delicious.  You get a hefty serving of chips along with the ginormous strips of fish, too. Really can't ask for more. My goodness it was wonderful. Unlike typical fish and chips you don't taste or feel that oiliness that you do with most places. The fish had a nice breading on the fish was absolutely mind-blowing and was extremely moist. It falls apart almost to a fault. I am very finicky about fish & chips because I grew up in Rhode Island, San Francisco, Hawaii  and spent some time in England, so it better be good or I'm not coming back.    There is only a few places I like for fish & chips in Arizona but this is one of the best places I've been to.    CUSTOMER SERVICE: The wait service was friendly and quick.  FOOD: The fish was exceptional. Fresh, moist and the perfect consistency. Just how fish and chips should be. I'm salivating as I'm typing this. It's so good you don't even need the tartar sauce, I just used  a tiny bit of vinegar and was good to go. CONCLUSION: This place is GREAT!  I highly recommend for any fish & chips lover. I definitely will be coming back here.

For those who don't know, this is a restaurant with about 110 beers. They also have a full bar and food. Now I'm not normally one for chain restaurants so I didn't have very many expectations when walking into Old Chicago, I'd much rather go to a mom & pop place instead. My wife, our friend Kathy & I went here today for lunch.   Our waiters name was Dave. We walked in and were seated right away. He took our drink order, and ran off to get it. He was super friendly and looked happy to be there, he was delightful, prompt and efficient. The thing that made this a great experience was the service. Our waiter wasn't constantly standing over us, but he was there when we needed something.  Our friend got the Spaghetti Pie. Fhe said it was HOT! and Delicious!  My wife and I got the "chicago Seven" Stromboli. The  Stromboli was OK. I'm not saying that they lived up to the exacting standards of some of my favorite pizza joints Sytomboli, But they do a decent job.  All three of us got the cheese cake for dessert. We all thought the creaminess of the cheesecake had a very nice texture. It's cheesecake what more can I say!!! ALL cheesecake is GOOD.  FOOD:  The food was good and flavorful. Good stuff PRICE: Rasonable prices! SERVICE: The service was great  AMBIENCE: Looks pretty much like any other Old Chicago with the beer tour plaques on the wall. The  atmosphere is just right for the neighborhood If you have never been, it is a typical sports bar.  CONCLUSION: All in all, a solid experience.  I really can't complain about Old Chicago. It is one of those places where the company you keep defines the experience as opposed to the venue itself. Tthat being said  think it's good enough to warrant another trip.

My wife didn't want to cook so she asked if we could go back to Old Chicago again. We went there for an early dinner. This time we brought our grandson with us.  It is with a heavy heart that I write this review. I know that this place has a well established reputation. I wanted to eat there again and be happy to write a raving review. And honestly, had they delivered even OK food, I would have done just that. My wife & grandson enjoyed their meals but I am the one writing the review and I was not satisfied. Let me just say right upfront I'm not really a chain restaurant kind of guy  Our server "Sam" was fine but nothing real personable or engaging. Although she was attentive when it came to drink refills.   My wife got the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo my grandson got the Italian Sausage Stromboli and I got the Classic Meat Lasagna. My wife got the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo my grandson got the Italian Sausage Stromboli and I got the Classic Meat Lasagna.   When our dinner did come we realized we didn't get silverware and had to ask for it. My wife enjoyed her Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo. My grandson also liked his dish a lot. Me on the other hand I did not like the Classic Meat Lasagna. Maybe if it was the marinara sauce?  Maybe it's just me and italian food, but it's so hard to find a good italian. Tonight I was very dissapointed. In fact I only ate a little of it and left the rest. When asked if I wanted a box I said "no thanks" As I stated in another review of mine "I'm not the kind of person to send my food back or complain" but you would think when a server can clearly see hardly any of the dish was eaten she would ask if it was OK. But she didn't. For some reason never asked how my dinner was..  All three of us got the cheese cake for dessert. We all enjoyed it. Like I said before "  ALL cheesecake is GOOD"  FOOD:  I think this is one of those places were some things are ok and some things are great - depending on what you like.  PRICE: good values and filling meals with reasonable prices. SERVICE: Nothing real personable or engaging.  AMBIENCE: Looks pretty much like any other Old Chicago  CONCLUSION:  The prices were decent given the quality & quantity of food

My wife Carol, our friend Kathy R. and my self decided to head up to Rock Springs for karaoke and arrive early for  dinner. The karaoke was  in the Saloon so we got a table and was greeted by Candice. She welcomed us to the Saloon and I must say it was one of the sincerest I have experience in a long time.   After a very short wait Jerold our waiter came and introduced himself and asked if we were there for diner. We replied yes so he took our drink order and said he would be right back with our drinks and menus.   We got our drinks and proceeded to order dinner. Kathy R. ordered a Rock Your World Burger.   My wife and Kathy got soup or salad with their dinner so they decided to try the soup. It was homemade my wife and Kathy were going on and on how good it was so I had a spoon full.  OMG it was so good. Katy's burger came and it looked overcooked but Kathy was raving about how good it was and told me I had to try a bite. It was moist, tasty and to my amazement it was good with nothing on it not even condiments. In fact I think when we go back I'll order one of their burgers. I even asked our waiter if the burger was a special mix like 80 % meat and 20% pork. He said no it was the spices they use and the way thy cook the burgers that made them taste so goo.   My wife ordered the Ranch house Pork Cutlets w/ gravy and came  a baked potato and a side of veggies which in this case was corn on the cob. It also came with a red applesauce. Carol the pork chop was cooked to perfection. Her only complaint it could have come with more gravy. She did say it wasn't hot hot only slightly above warm but You know from my reviews when Carol eats everything on her plate it must be good and she did.  For me I had the Meatloaf Platter (Their traditional family recipe) It was like homemade. It came with a side of either soup or  salad and corn on the cob. Even though the soup was amazingly delicious I went for the side salad.   When my dinner arrived it came with a brown gravy which was served o the side. It was excellent so I smothered it in the gravy Wow home made goodness.   After tasting Carol's home made applesauce I asked our waiter I I could get a bowl of it. He said he would gladly get me some but I'd have to wait because they are making more. When it came out unlike Carol's bowl which was good. Mine came out hot. Both the hot and good versions were excellent.  After dinner Jerold asked if we wanted any thing else. At this point we were joined by a another friend of ours, Sandy who said she wanted pie. She ordered a slice of rhubarb crumble pie, Carol got a slice of coconut cream pie but Kathy and I passed on having pie even though Rock Springs is famous for their pies.  After seeing the pies I couldn't resist so I had a fork full of Carol's and Sandy's pie.  Both pies were nothing short of Tasty goodness. Each individual pie was perfectly formed. The pie crust was flaky, had a nice golden color to them. Both pie crusts were buttery and had that freshly" bake pie taste. No wonder this place is known for their pies.  FOOD: All our food was fresh and delivered as ordered, the entire party had an enjoyable meal. PRICE: Very reasonable. SERVICE:  The service was superb.  AMBIANCE:  The saloon had  beautiful bar made back in the 1800's. The tables and chairs in the saloon had that old western cowboy look to them. To the right of the bar there is a western touristy shop.  CONUSION: Rock Springs Café Saloon and General Store is well regarded by locals and tourists alike.  We were seated immediately. The food was fantastic. The service was spot on. The décor was interesting. I mean there was so much interesting stuff to look at. Don't you love happy endings?  RETURN  FACTOR: 100%

Came here last night once again for karaoke with my wife and our friend Kathy R. We got there early so we could have a leisurely dinner before karaoke.   The saloon wasn't that crowded like two weeks ago yet the service was much slower. We couldn't help noticing two women were seated after we arrived and were immediately given menus while we were still waiting on someone to come take our order.  After waiting some more a gal took our drink orders.  More waiting they were finally delivered to our table. Not long after we got our drinks our waiter came over and took our food order. We all got a hamburger, salad and a small bowl of clam chowder.  To our surprise everything came out all at once. We were not expecting this at all. We even mentioned how disappointed that our food arrived all at once because some of it will get cold by the time were ready to eat it. This complaint seemed to go on deaf ears.  This being said the burgers were good. Nothing to write home about just good.  My wife Carol and Kathy ordered a slice of pie for desert. Carol got he coconut cream pie which she enjoyed. Kathy got the mixed berry pie. She thought it was way to sweet. In fact a few of our friends joined us later one ordered the cherry pie. She commented how over powering sweet it was and didn't finish it.  Another thing to note was no one cleared our plates after dinner. They were piling up. We were constantly moving them to make room at our table. After a while the  people seated next to us finished their meal so we bused our own table and took everything to where they were seated.   Later since we stayed for karaoke we ordered potato skins appetizer . They were greasy tasting (I mean how greasy) so we won't be getting them again. YICK!  FOOD:  The food was just "ok". Nothing remarkable at all. I expected more e considering the small sample I had on my first of Kathy R's burger.  PRICE: Reasonable. SERVICE:  The service was much slower this time around.  AMBIANCE: An 1800's old western bar. CONCLUSION:  I'm still willing to go back even though I this visit was below my expectations. RETURN  FACTOR: 90%  ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************  5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business.

My wife, our friend Kathy R.and I came here for Karaoke and dinner again. When we arrived there was only a few people in the saloon having dinner.  We waited a long time before someone came to our table and took our beverage orders. There was only one waiter servicing the saloon. After what seemed an eternity he eventually returned with our drinks and asked if we were ready to order.    Our friend Kathy R. ordered the fish n' chips dinner, a side salad and a piece of pie. my wife Carol ordered the honey fried chicken and waffles for her entrée. It came with a side salad, backed potato and corn on the cob. She also ordered a slice of coconut cream pie. I ordered the grilled liver and onions dinner. It came with a side salad, baked potato and corn on the cob.    When our meals finally arrived they were either lukewarm or cold. Kathy's told us to try a bite of her fish. There looked to be two small pieces of fish that wouldn't satisfy a child so we declined. We did try the "home made" potato chips. They were a little above lukewarm. Kathy said the fish was bland and if it didn't come with tarter sauce it would have had no taste at all.  She said her dinner salad was better than the last time she was there. But her apple pie tasted like it came from a can. Certainly not like home made or something that would be famous.  Carol's dinner (honey fried chicken and waffles) and a slice of coconut cream pie - The chicken was cold so were the waffles, baked potato and the corn. She offered me a piece of chicken to try and sure enough it was cold. It tasted awesome and I'm sure would have been enjoyable if it was hot like it should have been. She only ate one piece and the waffles before becoming so disgusted she had enough. She ate her salad, a bite from the corn and her pie. She said her pie was very good.   My entrée (grilled liver and onions) when my dinner arrived the baked potato was so cold it wouldn't even melt the butter so I didn't eat it. The corn on the cob was the same way and I left that as well. I did eat most of the liver but didn't finish it because it wasn't hot.  there was also a small dinner salad that came with my meal which I ate.  We were all going to send our dinners back but our waiter disappeared for so long and we were hungry we dug in. Like I said we were all hungry.  Kathy R. ate her salad. Her fish dinner was two pieces of small fish and lots of "home made" chips. She ate the fish after smothering it in tarter sauce, her salad and some of the chips.  I'm surprised when our waiter finally came back to our table he didn't ask how our meals were or comment about all the food that wasn't eaten. Nope he didn't even bother. Maybe he figured it was better not to ask. I don't know.  FOOD: Portions are OK although our friends Kathy's fish looked like it came off the kids menu it was so small. SERVICE: Slow, slow, slow but it wasn't our waiters fault it is managements. Our waiter was actually hustling and doing his best. CONCLUSION:  We all decided everything considered when we return here for  Karaoke we would stop somewhere else for dinner. None of us wants to give this place another try. Especially in light of their prices. I don't mind spending my hard earned money at a restaurant if the food is good. This place does not deserve our continued support. If I could have rated this experience on a scale from one to ten, one being bad. I'd rate it a - minus 20!!!!

Went here Friday night with my wife Carol and our friend Kathy for Karaoke in the bar/saloon. We arrived early for dinner (around 6pm), Karaoke started at 7pm. I have to admit it's been years sine I've been here and when I used to go it was in the restaurant not the bar/saloon..  We were immediately seated and ask what we wanted to drink  and then the waitress (her name was Cookie) took our order Carol & Kathy ordered the all-y-u-can-eat fish, I asked if I could try a small piece before I ordered.  Cookie said that would be no problem.  Cookie brought out drinks and me two small pieces of fish. I tasted it and decided I would order it as well..   When the fish came the pieces we very large and piping hot. The batter wasn't to heavy and the fish was mouthwateringly moist, flaky, tender and tasty. We all agreed we like the fish was cooked perfectly, which is a rarity.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Freshness characterizes everything we had. Highly recommended   I was pleasantly surprised . The service was excellent and the food was served promptly and efficient. Freshness characterizes everything   FOOD: Huge portions, Top quality SERVICE: Genuine good service which was a joy to witness. Our waitress was professional and attentive. PRICE: Comparable to other steak restaurants.  AMBIANCE: Rustic western steakhouse atmosphere. Yet popular with the locals and a place to bring out of town guests.

All I can say is don't judge a book by its cover ...  This is a family owned and run place where the food is inexpensive but every dish is fresh, delishious! & flavorful.   Their sauces are amazingly scrumptious. Yin's has to be my all-time favorite Chinese restaurants in Phoenix. I mean I know good Chinese food when I have it and considering the options available in Phoenix this is one of the better Chinese restaurants period.  They take standard dishes and add high-end ingredients and interesting flavors. They are very consistent (never had a bad meal). All the dishes are wonderful, you can't go wrong with anything.  Particularly good is their Wor Wonton Soup.  FOOD:  The food is always consistent (never had a bad meal). The food is superb!PRICE: The price was also quite reasonable. SERVICE:  the service has always been great  prompt, polite, and attentive.  AMBIENCE:  Just right for the neighborhood. The interior is rather standard Chinese restaurant fare, so nothing special there. CONCLUSION: I would highly recommend this place.

This establishment caters to Armature Radio Operators (Ham Radio). their service and knowledge of the products they sell Is tremendous. The people that work there are helpful, not-pushy, friendly, and even willing to teach you a thing or two.  When they're not busy this is a great place for new people to the hobby. When they're busy, however, they're busy.   The best part about HRO is the guys.  They all seem super experienced and knowledgeable. The staff are a great help answering technical questions.   CONCLUSION: Prices are a bit high compared to other Ham Radio stores HOWEVER If your into Ham Radios this is your ham heaven! This store has everything you might need.  ************************ What does my overall ratings mean *****************************  5 stars -Highly recommended.

The grandkids wanted Mr. Goodcents for dinner. We've been to this location several times throughout the years especially since it is right up the street from us.   I have always been  very impressed with this place!!  If you've never been, when you order a sub they literally slice the meat in front you... to me is what a sub should taste like.   I have always had a great experience with both the food AND customer service ).I prefer this over Subway or Quizno's anyday!!! Very reasonable prices and great food.  If you get a chance, try this place.

=====================  REVISITED 12/12/13 =====================  Came here last night after our weekly Thursday night meeting with two other people and my wife. It's obviously a popular place, it was quite busy.   I've eaten in countless Mexican restaurants . Arizona definitely has some of the best Mexican food and Manuel's is one of the best. Everything people ordered was terrific. The salsa is  freakin' awesome! The flavors, textures, and spices of this salsa are unmatched by any other. I could eat their chips and salsa all day long I'm addicted to it. The chips were fresh & hot. The best part is they brought you as many bowls of them as we wanted. . PORTIONS: Are plentiful. You won't leave here hungry that's for sure.  FOOD: OMG the food is so fabulous this has become my favorite place to eat Mexican food. My experiences with Manuel's are simply top notch and it is for this reason when I crave Mexican food  it has grown to become one of my favorite places to eat. The food is always hot, fresh, and tasty. SERVICE:Always great service.  Staff here is always upbeat pleasant, attentive , friendly &  professional.  PRICE: The price IS very reasonable. AMBIANCE: Nicely decorated. Family friendly & great for dinner with friends or business associated.

Monday Memorial Day) we called Oriental Express for take out. I ordered the Moo shu pork. It was very (hot) spicy. I couldn't eat it. I also ordered the Wonton soup. My wife ordered the Beef Broccoli and there was hardly any beef in the Beef & Broccoli. She said the egg roll that came with the dinner tasted nasty so she did not eat it.   This place serves just plain below average - average Chinese Food. As for quality,  sometimes well, you don't get what you pay for. Yet I was torn between giving it "meh" or "A-OK".  That's because their wonton soup is excellent.  So I rated the place 2 stars.

Wow. The food here was really great. My wife and I both got the rib eye steak.  The steaks were prepared at a perfect medium.   I can't say enough good things about this place . Both steaks were cooked to perfection they were soft, tender had a wonderful sear to them and had  great meat flavor. They were delicious and melted in your mouth.   The staff was super attentive the entire staff was impeccably hospitable. I must note that the service here is amazing. Everyone was so kind and accomodating and our server constantly checked on us. From beginning to end we had an exceptional experience.  For dessert we split a slice of Motherlode Cake. The Motherlode a six layer slice of decadent chocolate cake and rich chocolate fudge icing topped with walnuts. This cake was featured on the Food Network as one of America's "Top 5 Most Decadent Desserts" It was the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted.  It is rich in flavor but not overbearing with chocolate.  Perfect balance of sweetness & flavor,  Not dry & not over moist.  The "slice" was huge. It was so big we brought a lot of it home for another day.    FOOD: Everything is so incredibly delicious, tender, juicy, seasoned and cooked perfectly and so flavorful. The meat was tender and buttery that the FIRST BITE WAS HEAVEN. Both were seasoned and cooked perfectly.  Compliments to the chef for that!  PRICE: Typical steakhouse pricing. SERVICE: Spectacular service - from the hostess upon arrival, to our wonderful servers throughout our meal! It was delightful -- unobtrusive, yet still engaged, informed and friendly, CONCLUSION: Food absolutely amazing! (Portions are big, we couldn't finish ours and we didn't even order any appetizer as we really wanted to savor the steak RETURN  FACTOR: 100%.  ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************  5 stars -Highly recommended.

When you need a vehicle repaired TRUST & HONESTY is important. I met Randy years ago after getting a quote to fix the Volkswagen I owned at the time because it failed omissions and the original place I brought it to wanted $1,500.00 to get so it would pass inspection. At the time I didn't have the money. I heard about NAR at a business meeting I attended and thought I would bring my car to them and see if they could do the repair for less.  Randy called me later the same day and said he could definitely  get the car to pass inspection and all it would cost is the price of a fuel filter which would be around $9.99. I was so skeptical thinking no way was the other place wanting $1,500.00 and he only wanted $9.99. I mean the other place is where my dad had taken his car for years. They couldn't possibly be that far off the price of getting it back on the road or ripping me off that bad.  To make a long story short I picked up the car from National Automotive brought it to get inspection and IT PASSED !!!!!  I've been bringing my cars there ever since and that incident must have been 20 -25 years ago. CONCLUSION: Randy the owner is honest, trustworthy, ethical and detail oriented.  The service provided there is excellent and I highly recommend them.      ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ******************** 5 stars -Highly recommended.

I love family owned establishments. I just ate here for the first time. It was great!! By far the best Mediterranean food I've had in Phoenix. The quality of the service and food was excellent. The food was presented well, very tasty and enough portion size to leave me walking away stuffed.   I was joined by my wife Carol, my 22 year old grandson Michael and our friend Kathy R.  Kathy R. had eaten here before. In fact she has been coming here for years. She said at one time or another she has tried everything on the menu and just loves their food. Today she ordered the Moussaka. Which she aid was toasty, & creamy.  (Basically Moussaka is a lasagna without the noodles, the eggplant in it  adds the right amount of bitterness to balance out the great, intense flavor of the sauce.)Although I didn't try a bite it looked great.   Michael got cheese raviolis and an antipasto salad. He didn't say much about either dish but they looked good to me.   My wife & I got the Pork Souvlaki (Tender chunks of pork served over rice). My wife ate her plate clean which she rarely does so I know she liked her meal. She told me when we got home she wants to go back there so that told me she really enjoyed the food.  Like I said for my dinner entrée I ordered the Pork Souvlaki . But before I did I  ordered a Greek Salad as a starter. It was much bigger than I expected for a side salad. The salad was very fresh. The lettuce was crisp and the tomatoes were extremely tasty. I didn't know my entrée came with either a Greek salad or  Agolemono soup. Since I had already ordered and eaten a Greek salad I opted  for the Augolemono Soup (chicken stock, egg lemon soup) my soup was absolutely  outstanding!!!! All meals  also come with a vegetable of  the day and homemade pita bread. You could tell the pita bread was homemade. It tasted fresh and came out hot. OMG it was delicious.  I almost forgot with dinner Kathy R. wanted us to try the spaghetti with meat sauce so we could see what it was like. It was a small side dish. Kathy raved about it so I thought why not try it. My wife said she liked it and would order it. I thought it was just OK then again I grew up in Rhode Island in a very Italian neighborhood so it may have been good for a Greek restaurant but not to my taste. Back in Rhode Island the Italians and Greeks cooked many similar dishes including pasta dishes.  FOOD: All of the food was great. The food was so good! I would definitely come back for more in the future.PRICE: . SERVICE:   "staff" consisted of  a mother- sister-brother team.  The mom wasn't there today. The brother sat us and brought us menus. He was very friendly. The sister was our waitress and server, she was attentive and friendly.  AMBIANCE:  A cute little family owned restaurant tucked in a small strip mall. The atmosphere in the restaurant is lovely. It does look like it has been there for many years but the place is NOT as Nadia C, said "Dumpy".  CONCLUSION:  We were seated immediately. Food was excellent, service was spot-on. My recommendation: if you want authentic, come here for an outstanding dining experience!!! This is a very special neighborhood ethnic restaurant.TURN FACTOR: 100%

My wife & I  have been coming here for years.  We've come for Karaoke, to meet friends, bring the family, to enjoy a game on TV, for lunch and dinner ad enjoy a game on TV.  I think their wings are some of the best in town. If you want great tasting  NNY is the place to go.   the service here is always good. The food is always hot, fresh and fairly fast even when their busy. It's great for families, meetings or just to hang out.  FOOD: Always good. SERVICE: Professional & attentive. PRICE: The prices are compatible to places like Gallagher's ,Santisi Brothers Pizzeria and Sports Grill, Applebee's  or others like them in the area. CONCLUSION: Relaxed atmosphere where you can have a relaxed meal and spend some time doing it.

This place isn't far from my house so when we are craving something quick and easy for breakfast we stop at Bagel Gormet. In fact we went there as late as last week although throughout the years we have been there many times. They have a wide selection of bagels that are awesome. They specialize in Old World Water Boiled Bagels (makes all the difference) .   We normally get the Denver Breakfast Bagel (Egg, Ham, Cheese, Bell Pepper, Onion). The first time my wife & I tried their bagels we both were flabbergasted. Right away we thought this is what a bagel should taste like. Their bagels are fresh, tasty ,chewy, doughy and so delicious.     In summary, when you go to Bagel Gormet, you can expect fresh  bagels with a nice variety of spreads. Plus they serve great Sandwiches, salades and deserts.  CUSTOMER SERVICE:  The service was extremely fast (as fast as it can be done) and everyone was very friendly. The people who work here are nice and down to earth FOOD: Delectable  ....sooo delicious. Bagels are soft, flavorful and delicious  AMBIENCE: The inside is comfy and quaint . Comfortable feel a good place for to grt a quick bite or cup of coffee casual conversation. CONCLUSION: I would recommend this place to anyone!!!   Delicious bagels!!!  So check them out!!

I haven't been to rawhide in many years. Even at it's newer location it is still is a great play to take out of town visitors. Where the pavement ends and the west begins. The town and people look like they are from an old west movie. Rawhide is like stepping back in time. It allows you to forget all your troubles during your visit.   ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************  5 stars -Highly recommended.

La Perla Café is family owned/operated and has been around for YEARS. I went there with my wife Carol for dinner.   Carol got the #23 combo (Tostada, enchilada & a taco) she totally devoured her meal so I know she liked it. When she was done there was nothing left on her plate.   I got the Cimichanga dinner w/ rice and refried beans. My entrée was mouthwatering scrumptious. It was well-prepared, flavorful and came out sizzling hot. OMG, the food is SO GOOD here, all the way down to their terrific salsa!  Every bite of it was just stellar!  Outstanding Mexican comfort food. Excellent service from Sandra, our waitress. This place is has excellent food and the prices are reasonable in addition the quality is top notch.  One of the other greatest parts of the meal was the 3 different salsas they serve with their home made chips. They come in small carafes with the food.  All three salsa were extremely flavorful in a way totally unique to La Perla Café. Their salsa unlike most places is less spicy and more flavorful. Its also not so thick.   If you love Mexican food you really owe it to yourself to check out La Perla.   FOOD: Top quality Mexican food - MUY DELICIOSO!!! SERVICE: The people are very nice, helpful and caring. They truly want you to enjoy the food they make for you. PRICE: Comparable to other Mexican restaurants.  AMBIANCE: Rustic western steakhouse atmosphere. CONCLUSION: AMAZING FAMILY OWED MEXICAN RESTAURANT! A truly wonderful establishment. I cant believe how long its been around and how nice and hospitable everyone there was. I love supporting independent, family run business.  Props to La Perla Café for staying authentic through the years. If you love Mexican food definitely  visit this restaurant.

My wife our friend Kathy R. and myself stopped here for lunch. As soon as we stepped in, we were greeted by Lacey who was extremely friendly.  Lacey gave us ample time to Perouse  the menu until we all deicide what we wanted.   For starters I ordered the Calamari for my wife & I . It was alright, thinly coated but not really fired the way I normally like. It was decent but not special. I've had way better here in Arizona..  Our waitress brought us the beverages we ordered then took our meal order. Dinner gets off to a good start here with a nice basket of garlic bread sticks,Our entrees came shortly thereafter. Our friend started with the soup which she said was absolutely delicious.  For her entrée Kathy got the Ziti with a side salad. She raved about the garlic dressing. And kept going on and on about it until her meal came. She thought the Ziti was outstanding.  For dessert Kathy got the home made Tiramisu. It was soaked in brandy and espresso, layered with sweetened marscapone cheese and kahlua.  Topped off with cocoa powder. She thought it was outstanding.  My wife Carol decided on the  Sausage, peppers & onions (Mild Italian Sausage slow baked with sweet peppers, onions, marinara sauce and spices with side of pasta). Carol thought the dish was superb. For dessert Carol got the Lemoncello Marscapone Cake. Carol loves lemon and said it was A delightful and light lemon flavored cake. It was and rich and loaded with delicious Lemon flavor.  I got the Veal Parmesan it came with a small dinner salad and pasta w/ marinara sauce. The pasta is extremely high quality-- perfectly cooked. The veal parmesan was tender and prepared nicely. I always judge an Italian restaurant on the Veal Parmesan if they have it or the eggplant parmesan. In this case it was the veal. The dish was classic  Italian fare, nothing really different than what you find on every menu Italian Restaurant in Arizona.  But it was pretty tasty. For dessert I ordered the cheese cake. It was creamy and rich but nothing special.  FOOD: Food was very good. Kathy R. and my wife was impressed with the quality of their dish. As for me I thought the food was good but didn't knock my socks off like I was expecting. While everything tasted fine, I did not taste any heart or soul in the dishes and Italian food normally has a lot of TLC along with heart and soul put into their dishes. SERVICE:Lacey provided us with Tremendous service. PRICE: The prices on the lunch menu wasn't terrible. CONCLUSION: Nice atmosphere.  Relaxed, unpretentious, and comfortable in a way that makes you want to spend time just chatting with friends. The portions were just right for lunch not to big that you left stuffed but not  small where you left hungry. You cannot go home hungry from here.

This place is an oldie but a goodie. The Old West décor  / atmosphere and theme of everything was pretty cool. The best part it is this place really is old. The building that is now a bar and where you order food dates back to the 1800's.   They have an outdoor dance floor, corrals full of burros, rustic wagons, fire pits, and more. The trick is to go when the weather is nice because you sit outside at picnic tables.   The menu is also simple - burgers and dogs.  we ordered cheese burgers. They come with potato chips, no fries, but we didn't miss them. If you're tired of everyday fast food burgers and ready to try a GREAT!! TASTING!! old fashioned burger you got get it here. THIS REVIEW IS FOR THEIR BURGERS.  Inside the old bunkhouse which has been converted to a bar on one side the other side is where you go to a window and order. When we walked in to order there was a  "heavenly aroma" coming from the kitchen area. Burgers were cooking.     My wife and I had a cheese burger with lettuce, tomato and onion and a pickle. It was huge. Their burger are a 1/2 pound and was cooked the way we wanted (medium). A little sloppy but oh so good.   Everything that this glorious burger is made of is sheer perfection. They were truly a force to be reckoned with considering the burgers were a 1/2 a pound. Gets my stomach rumbling just thinking about it! The meat was tender, the burgers were melt-in-your-mouth with a generous helping of melted cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and onions. The bun was fresh, perfectly toasted with just the right amount of butter.  All the components worked together in perfect harmony even to the condiments.   FOOD: The menu is simple. Very simple. You're here for two reasons, hamburgers or hot dogs. They do have a few other items on their menu (basic comfort food)  if you want something different you should probably go somewhere else.   AMBIANCE: Rustic atmosphere. If you have people visiting from out of town, you should take them here. Its a unique experience that everyone should know about! PRICE: Average. SERVICE: You order from a window in the bar. CONCLUSION: There can be crowds here at times, especially weekends. but don't let them intimidate you (this is good though, it means it is good to visit and for their food). There is plenty of seating and the cooks are quick! old west  rustic décor is great. Portions here are big.  I enjoyed this place -- food, price, service, atmosphere -- everything you'd want.  Highly recommended  RETURN  FACTOR: 100%. Don't even think, just go. You can come back and thank me later.  ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************  5 stars -Highly recommended.

Since moving from Hawaii back in 1995 to Arizona, I've been very skeptical about places that claim to serve "Hawaiian" food here, because as we all know, pineapple on a pizza does NOT make it Hawaiian. I know what Hawaiian-esque food is supposed to taste like.   Right away I wasn't impressed because we weren't greeted by the customary Aloha that the person behind the counter is supposed to do to everyone entering the restaurant.  Some people were but not us. The place had the look and feel of a fast food restaurant. Dah that's because it was. The décor was made up of posters of Hawaii, Hawaiian Aloha shirts and a single surfboard on the walls. Not very impressive nor did it give you the feel of a restaurant in Hawaii.   Anyway to the food. My wife ordered the Kalua Pork - Smoke-flavored, shredded pork with white rice mixed with cabbage. She immediately said it didn't taste anything like the pork we've had in Hawaii. It had no flavor so she added some  katsu sauce to it. That made it edible. She didn't even eat the rice or cabbage. I think she only ate the pork because she was hungry.     I ordered the 1/2 and 1/2 plate of chicken, & short ribs. It came with white rice, cabbage and macaroni salad. But the  macaroni salad was not cold because they placed the chicken which was hot on top of the macaroni salad so it was warm. The short ribs were NOTHING like I had when I lived in Hawaii. In addition to them not being "authentic" I've had better at local Asian restaurants or buffets. I have to admit the chicken wasn't that bad but again it wasn't "authentic" Hawaiian short ribs either. I dipped it in their teriyaki sauce which made it better. The short ribs on the other hand was so bad I didn't eat them. They were tasteless  and Hawaiian short ribs are normally amazing.    I guess this is what happens when you try and eat Hawaiian food in a city like Phoenix that's the furthest you can possible get from Hawaii. I'll never come back here because of their false advertising and horrible food. Please change your name L&L Hawaiian BBQ, because this place is not Hawaiian.  FOOD: Maybe the original L & L in Hawaii is good but this L&L franchise location was truly  disappointing. The food was SUB-PAR  If I would have been satisfied with my meal maybe I wouldn't be judging this place so harshly. I was so disappointed that the food didn't live up to what the promises in its name. SERVICE:  The gal behind the counter represented everything but the spirit of Aloha was about. She had a look one her that said she wasn't very happy and didn't want to be there. PRICE: The price  for the quality of food you receive is high. AMBIANCE:The décor was made up of posters of Hawaii, Hawaiian Aloha shirts and a single surfboard on the walls. Not very impressive nor did it give you the feel of a restaurant in Hawaii. CONCLUSION: There's not really much to say here..I miss Hawaii... but what i miss more is the FOOD!  I spotted this place while visiting Applebee's and thought... OH MAN - THIS IS GONNA BE AMAZING!  then I tried it. RETURN FACTOR 0%.         ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************  5 stars -Highly recommended.

My wife & I have been going here since 1985. The salsa( I'm a huge salsa guy ) In my opinion is the best salsa in the valley. Their chips are always served hot and taste fresh. They are so good I could make a meal of  just their chips and salsa.   We pretty much stick to a few of our favorite dishes. After I make a pig out of myself on salsa & chips I start my meal with a bowl of Albondiga Soup (Meatball soup with fresh vegetables).  For my entrée I usually get a  SIZZLING platter of beef Fajita with grilled vegetables. My wife usually gets a Chimichanga.  Both dishes come with a side of guacamole, sour cream and Spanish rice.  In addition the Fajita comes with corn or flour tortilla. As for the flavor of their food, their dishes are bursting with it.   The food here is always cooked to perfection, tasty, fresh, delicious and served hot.  The service is usually awesome. In fact my sister who lives in Rhode Island always makes it a point to stop at Valle Luna to get her Mexican Food fix.   WARNING: If you get there during normal dinner time you're going to have trouble parking and you're going to have to wait to get a table.   FOOD: Drool worthy Arizona-Sonoran recipes!!! Always fresh, consistent, and served promptly.  PRICE: Very reasonable. SERVICE:  Service is usually good but they can get very busy. However I must say the wait for food is normally pretty darned fast considering how busy they can be at times.  CONCULSION: We've had our share of lousy over-priced Mexican restaurants. This place has been a go-to eating spot for outings with family and friends for years. Parking can be a challenge when they are busy but I feel their food is so good its worth trying to get a parking space.   RETURN  FACTOR: 100% We keep coming back! because we love this place.  ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************  5 stars -Highly recommended.

There was four of us who went here today for a late lunch.  My wife Carol, our friend Kathy R. and a close friend of mine from Oaklahoma Cliff Y and of course me.  I don't even know where to begin about this restaurant, right from the get go I knew there was going to be problems. We started off with  appetizers. When the dolmades was served it was slightly warm to the touch. The Flaming Saganaki (slice of cheese set on fire) was excellent in addition to being an impressive presentation it was darn cool.   So our food comes out, this is where things turned bad...here is what we all got: Our friend Kathy R. -  Mousaka - When it was served the Sautéed veggies were somewhat warm but more on the cold side. The Mousaka was frozen in the middle. She asked for it to be reheated. Her soup was not hot so she also sent that back to be reheated. Of course when the Mousaka and soup returned both were very hot.  BUT when Kathy tasted her dish she said this is so bad it it was inedible and didn't eat the Mousaka. I thing she had her soup.  My friend Cliff Y. said he enjoyed his Gyro plate and told me everything was fine. But that was probably because he was extremely hungry before his food arrived or he was just being polite.  My wife, Carol had  a a combo pork and chicken kebab. It came out , marginally  warm this included the roasted potatoes, veggies and meat so she sent it all back to be reheated. When her dish returned she ate it and enjoyed her food.  My dish - I ordered a combination plate which consisted of a Beef & veggie kebab. I started off my meal with a side salad, it was good but a salad is a  salad. The Beef and veggie kebab like everyine elses that was served during our visit was barely this included the roasted potaotes, meat and veggies. I was so disappoinyed I simply pushed my meal aside and did not eat it. There is nothing more discusting as food served lukewarm. Ontop of everything else my beef kebob was over cooked and dry. Yick! When asked if I wanted something else I said no just take it away.   With all the food that was sent back and our comments / complaints during dinner to our waitress the manager never came out to speak to us. Instead another waitress compt'd us a couple of deserrts and gave me two $10.00 gift certificates (good for one gift certificate per table per visit) for on our next vist. This is one a $96.00 bill. I was curious about the restaurant so I asked " Is everything made in advance and just reheated here". She told me all the food is prepaired fresh and cooked daily. I seriously doubt it.  FOOD: Honestly, none of the dishes really stood out to me. A real disappointment. The presentation of the food on our plates was impressive but that is where it stopped. PRICE: reasonable price. SERVICE: Our waitress Mercedes was polite, attentive and courteous.  AMBIENCE: The restaurant is pretty and has a lovely atmosphere  CONCLUSION:  I left so upset, disappointed and unsatisfied. I wasn't a bit Impressed. I can say with 100% certainty, I will not being going back... fhe cold food did me in.

Old Town is an excellent location to bring out of town visitors. Lots of places to shop for "authentic" Arizona Native American (Indian) and western merchandise.  There is an abundance of great places to eat. If your into Art there is an Art District here with plenty of gallery's.   There is trolley to take you all over town that stops along the way so you can do some exploring on your own.   There are two comedy clubs to entertain you. The Comedy Spot and Standup Scottsdale. Both offer a verity of local and national comedians.  The nightlife here offers some of the most clubs and bars in the country.  Parking can be a problem at times but don't get discouraged it's worth driving around to find a spot.   There is so much more to do in Old town. I haven't even begun to scratch the surface in this review. A bit on the pricy side at some of the shops but hey you can  window shop if nothing else or find yourself a  great place to eat.  ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************  5 stars -Highly recommended.

My 21 year old grandson who lives with my wife & I along with My 14 year old grandson who spent the night while my wife is in the hospital for a knee replacement. After leaving the hospital around 7pm we stopped at In-N-Out Burger for a quick dinner. I normally detest fast food, but I don't even think In-N-Out truly belongs in that category.  A lot of people would say In-N-Out is overrated but they are good. They have a very limited menu of get a load of this, all they have is burgers, fries and a few beverages to wash them down.    FOOD: Cooked fresh, our burgers came out hot. They weren't sitting under a heat lamp like some places. It's fast food that's WAY better than any other options out there. For a fast food burger the flavor can't be beat. FYI: I'm NOT a fan of their fries. PRICE: reasonable price. SERVICE: The service was fast and they were really nice. CONCLUSION: I don't know what the secret  is.  Chances are you can make a better burger at home, but at the same time there is just something about In-N-Out burgers that makes them  delicious. Everything was cooked to perfection! This In N Out is on it! They're at the top of their game to handle soooooooooooo many people and still produce such top notch food!

I have been Jonesing for some Kimchee and was going to order it on-line. My wife (Carol) said she would pick me up some at Asiana Market on Union Hills near our house.  I wasn't with my wife when she picked up the Kimchee so I have no idea what the market is like. By the way for those not in the know -Kimchee is a traditional fermented Korean side dish usually made with a variety of seasonings that is allowed to ferment underground in jars for months at a time. It is Korea's national dish, with a main vegetable ingredient such as napa cabbage.  Frankly I was doubtful the Kimchee would be as good as I have got at some Korean restaurants, especially coming from a market. It definitely wasn't as "strong" as I like it or have tasted before. However their Kim Chi far exceeded my expectations. It was amazingly delicious. The Kimchi is ctually better than what you can get in most restaurants and not all that expensive.  While at the market Carol also got some Sushi that was pre-packaged. All the package said was "Koren Sushi" so I have no idea what kind of Suchi it was.  Whatever it was it was interesting, tasty, different and unique, nothing that I've seen or tried before and I love Sushi. Lets just say I was pleasantly surprised. Not the best out there. However, it is definitely better than average (at least from what I've had in the past year) . Remember this is from a market not a Sushi restaurant.    I want to check out this place for myself so I will be going there in the near future.

My wife and I come here for the Unlimited Soup and Salad. My wife always gets the Santa Fe Salad and usually the Broccoli soup. If it isn't the soup of the day then she will get the French Onion Soup. On occasion she goes for the Corn Chowder Soup. Her only complaint is they serve Pepsi products instead of Coke.    For me I always get the Oriental Chicken Salad with either the French Onion Soup, or the Corn Chowder.  If you have never been to a Applebee's for their Unlimited Soup and Salad  you should give it a try.  This particular location is clean as one would hope and the staff is attentive as expected. It is a nice place to grab a quick bite in the neighborhood  CUSTOMER SERVICE: The wait service is always friendly and quick.  FOOD: The food isn't out of this world phenomenal, but it is pretty good and reasonable priced and always a  good value. AMBIENCE: Fun with a very comfortable feel but sometimes it trends a little loud but not so much that it still wouldn't be a good place for dates and casual conversation. CONCLUSION: I can't really think of anything I don't like about the place.  This place is a clean, and trendy. We definitely leave full and happy which is why we come back often.

I'm sure Arizona Pizza Company is a great place to stop and have a beer with your friends, there is plenty of TV's to watch in addition to do some off track betting. I didn't know this was a sports bar never mind that it had off track betting. The last time I was here (many years ago) it was a pizza place. Families were there with kids so I was suprised to see it had changed.   That being said we didn't go there for the noisy bar, to watch sports on TV or off track betting we there to have a late lunch and we wanted pizza. Since we were already there and didn't want to go looking for anoother place to eat, we stayed. Each of us (my wife- Carol, our friend Kathy R. and me) all ordered a personal pizza. Kathy R. & my wife ordered a pepperoni & sausage personal pizza. I ordered the Meat lovers pizza (pepperoni, sauage, & meatball) Kathy & I also got a side salad.   It seems I must be a lot more picky than my wife and Kathy. They both enjoyed their pizza and said it was very good. Now the last time I had a wood fired pizza it was at the Colorado Belle (Laughlin, NV ) in The Boiler pub and it was   Absolutely delicious!! so I was excited to try the pizza here because they advertised wood fired pizzas. My pizza crust was thin and crispy with some burnt edges, it looked great. Pizza is Pizza right?  WRONG, I left feeling like I could have done better elsewhere.  FOOD: The pizza was NOT that impressive. Overall the pizza lacked flavor. It was rather bland. A real disappointment considering it was wood fired pizza. PRICE: Decently priced. You will not find these prices for the quality anywhere. SERVICE: The service was okay. Our waitress was nice and attentive but she did not introduce herself, .  CONCLUSION:  The restaurant is not well suited for families. It is a noisy sports bar with off track betting.  I wasn't that impressed.

I don't know why people are saying this Fry's is the worst or they hate this store because my wife & I have been going to this Fry's Food & Drug Store ever sine we moved here in 1985. Since this Fry's across the street from our neighborhood we shop here frequently.   Over the years my wife & I have watched this store literally morph into different versions of itself.  The cashiers / staff here are very friendly and efficient  and since my wife is here a lot more than I am, they recognize her and everybody is always pleasant.    Another great thing you really do SAVE A LOT shopping here, but you're not going to be able to find everything on your grocery list.  Nevertheless, it's a great place to stock up on because they sure do have a lots of variety!  PARKING: This neighborhood Fry's has an ample parking lot. We never have a problem finding parking. SERVICE: Never have to wait too long at the checkout. EXTRA'S: Our club cards always knocks off an extra money. Chi ching! SELECTION: The good part of being a busy fast paced store is the stock is fresh. Produce, bakery, meat always look fresh and restocked. CONCLUSION: Consistently meets our needs. Sure. When it comes to grocery stores, I believe you have to adjust your expectations accordingly. There's nothing fancy about this Fry's in general, but I believe this location offers a good combination of friendly staff, decent selection, and a great environment for your every day needs. In addition it has good prices. Is large, clean and usually well stocked. It is simply where my wife & I do all our main shopping.

I had gift certificates to this place and wanted to eat healthier so it was decided that my wife, Kathy R., my grandson and I would head here for lunch.   My wife got the Kobe steak & lobster, Kathy R. got the kobe steak, my grandson got the kobe steak and lobster and I had the kobe steak.  All the meals come with: Miso soup, salad, choice of white or chicken fried rice and grilled veggies. When you go to a teppenyaki restaurant, you don't really go for the food, you kind of go for the entertainment. but this place served Kobe beef. Kobe beef is known for being lean, lower in cholesterol than chicken or turkey. it is known as  Healthy beef? In fact all of us  commented that the steak was so succulent it melted in your mouth.  Kobe has community seating...(The tables are designed to fit 8 people) You are seated next to other parties around the chef and the chef comes by after all orders are taken. Then in addition the chef brings all fresh ingredients to the table and cooks it for you on the spot with various tricks! The show is very impressive.  The "show" is the checf who cooks in front of you.  In this case he also pulled tricks with knives and fire to keep us all entertained.  My steak was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. There is nothing like Kobe Steak. The Miso soup was excellent, the salad was so so,  the grilled veggies were ok. It also came with white rice which I did not eat. I only had a few bites of everything and took a lot home with me for later.    One last thing about the meal sevral people at our table ordered fried rice so  we were given the opportunity to try some since the chef made extra. I must say even though I only had a bite OMG it was good. It had to be the best fried rice I've had in many years.   FOOD:  If you rate the place strictly on food, then it's not that spectacular. But you're not here solely for food. You come here for an experience. PRICE: The prices are reasonable. SERVICE: After we got seated the waitress immediately gave us menus and asked us for our drinks/orders. She was welcoming, and  was always right there when we needed her to be. She was simply excellent,  efficient, and friendly.  AMBIENCE:  Overall I enjoyed the restaurants environment and vibe! Perfect for families and group celebrations! It's pricey but you gotta keep in mind you're also paying for the entertainment and its unique service. CONCLUSION: This restaurant is fun for birthdays, Anniversaries, special occassions, group outings, couples, and kids. It's entertaining and the food tastes great.   RETURN FACTOR: 100% will definitely be back here but only for a special occassion..

I haven't been here in a month or more but my wife & I have visited this restaurant many times. I alwys leave a bit poorer and we are normally stuffed to the brim.   First off whenever you walk in everyone greets you.   My wife & I love the SIZE and fresh flavor of Koi 's Sushi & Sashimi. The quality cannot be beat The balance between rice and fish was perfect. The freshness of the fish was incredible and the rice was just the right consistency and temperature.  Every time we have come here we were seated as soon as we checked in and handed our menu.The menu offers a wide variety of dishes. The ambiance of the place is casual.  The service is spectacular and friendly.  Our glasses were never empty nor did we have to ask for anything we needed since it was provided to us even before we asked for it.  The price was very reasonable for the amount, taste, and quality of food that they serve.    This place is great!!  The food is always tasty and fresh. I love all of the creative rolls they have but I also really enjoy the simple sushi or sashimi dishes. The menu has a large variety and so most people should be able find something that they would like on it.   The food is always tasty and fresh.

My wife and I stopped here around 11:30 so we could have had lunch or breakfast. We choose breakfast. The place was very busy but we didn't have to wait very long.  Our waitress Jackie immediately came to our table and took our drink order. Then gave us plenty of time to decide on our entrée.   I ordered the "Build your own omelet" With a side of cottage cheese and diced potatoes. I know it's hard to ruin breakfast but . . . this place does breakfast right. My omelet was perfect in every way.   My wife ordered 2 eggs (medium) w / waffles they were perfect as well. On a side note;   By the way we saw a couple of guys who ordered the biscuits & gavel. .. Holy cow they were  HUGE.   FOOD: Diner style comfort food. HUGE portions.  SERVICE: Our waitress Jackie was very friendly, and attentive. PRICE: Was NOT expensive at all for the quantity of food you get. CONCLUSION: The food was served hot , and quickly (even though they are very busy) and the way we wanted. I see why they are sooooooooooo busy. RETURN FACTOR 100%.         ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************  5 stars -Highly recommended.

I was born & raised in New England, Moved to the San Francisco Bay Area, visited the UK  and later lived on Maui ,Hawaii so I know good fish & chips. I can speak with some authority when I say here in Phoenix good fish & chips is hard to find.   The good news is The Codfather Fish and chips is the way it was meant to be made.  A large crispy coating, and fries deep fried to perfection.  If you are looking for this classic dish, you will not find a better place than the Codfather. GIANT piece of fried fish and it was delicious. Crispy, soft, juicy, flavourful, perfect with a little vinegar. Amazingly delicious. the chips were golden, fluffy, crispy on the outside but not so much that they can't absorb a generous amount of malt vinegar. For the price, could you really ask for more  My wife & I ordered the cod, which was a HUGE portion and a side of large chips.  The cod was breaded and cooked to a perfectly crispy and crunchy consistency, while still maintaining the moist fish.     FOOD: I ordered the cod, which was a HUGE portion and a side of large chips.  The cod was breaded and cooked to a perfectly crispy and crunchy consistency, while still maintaining the moist fish. I can say that the fish was fresh and the oil that it was cooked in was clean. The fish was fresh as it didn't taste fishy. The fries were lightly fried and it didn't taste too oily which was a good thing. The The chips were delicious ! PRICE: For the price, could you really ask for more.CONCLUSION:  Grab that malt vinegar and pour it on, because this fish and chip stop is the one to enjoy.

My wife and I have been shopping here for 29 years. We have seen it grow, renovated and change. The people there offer great service. The store has self checkouts, ample parking and reasonable prices. It' close by  so it's convenient. All in all it's your typical big chain grocery store but the wife & I like it.  I don't know about you but I like to buy vegetables and fruits that are pretty, not rotten, and displayed nicely. Which this store does. This our go to place - they have 99% percent of what we're shopping for, 99% of the time. Their prices are good and store is clean... what more can you ask for in a grocery store?   SERVICE:  The staff is always very pleasant. PRICE:  CONCLUSION: They offer reward points towards a discount for gas. Convenient do-it-yourself cashier system. The meat section looks good. We get coupons mailed to us with specials & discounts. There is a Chase bank in the store. Over all the store is nice, it's clean and has a large selection of goods. Basically the store has everything that my wife & I need and more.

Came here 12/14/13 for lunch with my wife Carol. There was only one other couple dining. Our waitress Cassidy took our drink order and gave us ample time to look over the menu. We both decided on the broaster Chicken. I haven't had broaster Chicken in years. It was delicious.  The chicken was marinated and coated in a golden brown, crispy-crunchy coating. The  chicken was heavenly.  I am salivating now, just by trying to remember its taste. Both combo's came with braoster potato wedges. The potatoes were extremely hot, crispy,     Second of all, PRICING wise, they are CHEAP. Or should I say budget-friendly.  FOOD: Chicken was fabulous.  It was crispy, hot fresh, and tasty. SERVICE: Was spot on. Attentive and professional. PRICE: The price IS very reasonable.

I don't eat a lot of donuts, so I don't have a huge amount of donut "experience" from which to draw. As a side note - I just don't give out 5 stars loosly. In fact I rarly give anyone 5 Stars. 5 Stars to me means everything was above and beyond my expectations. Lamar's is donuts done the way donuts should be. Which is why I didn't give them 5 Stars.  There's not much more to say - every flavor they make is delicious - I don't even know if I could pick a favorite.  They are all absolutely delicious (They are not overly sweet like Krispy Kreme ).  I prefer them greatly over Krispy Kreme and of course any grocery store donuts.   Let me tell you why we recently stopped here to get some donuts. I was watching a TV called "Shark Tank" .  Shark Tank is an American reality TV series. The show features a panel of "potential investors", called "sharks", who consider offers from "aspiring entrepreneurs" seeking investments for their business or product. The entrepreneur or "contestant" can make a deal on the show if a panel member is interested.   I saw a a compay on the show called Tom+Chee. They serve all kinds of grilled cheese sandwiches and old fashioned tomato soup. Anyway the featured a Grilled Cheese Donut ( a glazed donut cooked kije tou would any other grilled cheese sandwich. I was intrigued  by this thus the need to visit Lamar's Donut Shop. Plus I needed a large sized donut and Lamar's are bigger than most other donuts. By the way the donut grilled cheese sandwich we made was a little to sweet for my liking but everyone else who tried it, loved it.  FOOD:  Just what you would expect from a fantasic donut shop - delicious. PRICE: reasonable prices. SERVICE: customer service here isreally nice and helpful.  AMBIENCE: Looks pretty much like any other donut shop  CONCLUSION:  Donuts the way they are supposed to be, which actually isn't as easy to come by as you would expect. If you're into dounuts seriously this place!

Lots of bars and restaurants do chicken wings but putting out the perfect wing that is another story.... I've been here a few times and absolutely loveeeeeee their wings! So this review is NOT about the bar or the other food they serve, it is solely based on  their wings. That being said the majority of their food is excellent and above average for "bar type food". I cannot find anything wrong with Caps. It is never too crowded or crazy, never too loud or dark, it is a  great spot for drinks, good food and socializing.  Now back to their wings...I can't even think about this place without an insane craving for their wings.  They have the perfect wing. They just the right level of sauciness, at very reasonable prices. Plus he wings are usually prepared quickly, although any wait is well worth it.   THE BEST OF THE BEST CHICKEN WINGS ON THE PLANET!!! Served piping hot, perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy in the inside.  The wings are amazing. Seriously if you want to try something that is out of this world get the wings the way you normally enjoy them and then ask to get them grilled. OMG!!!. You'll never have wings crispier or juicier than this. The wings are amongst the best I've had  and I've had wings across the country and just ask my wife, I can be very critical of wings. Caps wings are seriously addicting! delicious wings.  FOOD: You can get your wings dry or soggy or even better get them grilled. Mouth wateringly delicious. Very very flavorful.   The texture of the wing is spot on.  PRICE: SERVICE: The staff is always nice & reasonably attentive.  AMBIENCE: Awesome neighborhood atmosphere CONCLUSION: Good size and the portions FANTASTIC wings! I am a wing guy, and VERY particular about my wings and these wings are GREAT!!!!!!

I tried this place for three reasons. 1)  I've been searching for a better Chinese food restaurant than where we go now. 2) Several weeks ago someone dropped off a menu at our house. 3) Decided to try something new.   Delivery took only 25 minutets and the food arrived very hot.   My wife ordered the beef with broccoli. I ordered the shrimp with lobster sauce. My wife took one bite and said the beef was tough and the broccoli was hard (it wasn't coooked enough). She also said her dish smelt weird. At that point I dug into my shrimp & lobster sauce. It was more like egg drop soup than any shrimp and lobster sauce dishe I have ever tried anywhere. I also paid extra and got fried rice instead of white rice. It was so bland it was inedible. Everything went  immediately in the trash  We  also ordered  Wor Wonton Soup and got a free entree which we were planning on having for lunch or dinner tomorrow. Since we put the entrees in the trash nd were hungry we decided to give the soup a try. There was large chunks of pork in the soup which looked good but after trying a piece I was sure that was not how the meat was supposed to taste. My wife agreed and we ended pouring it down the drain. We then tried the free almond chicken entree.  Again the dish was nothing short of  disgusting! so it went directly into the trash as well.  FOOD: wanted to really enjoy it, but honestly, the food was detestable. We both  nearly gagged just after tasting it. To say our food was dissatisfactory is an understatement. STAY AWAY!!!! PRICE: Wasn't worth the price even if it was free.. SERVICE: Fast delivery.  CONCLUSION:  I have rarely been this disappointed with a restaurant . If I could give this place 0 stars I would. This is the worst chinese restaurant ever!    Dinner cost $28.37 and it ALL went down the drain or in the trash. I will never order from this establishment again. STAY AWAY!!!!

First off let me say I did not put much faith in Chiropractors. I just didn't believe all the things they claimed they could accomplish. So I never went to one.   Then one day on a Tuesday I was walking out of a business meeting and started to limp. It got worse as I continued toward the door. Lucky for me my wife was with me that day because I had to lean on her to get to my car. Wednesday morning I could not walk with out the most agonizing pain I ever experienced. The pain was in my lower back and legs. It was so bad I had to ask my wife to go out and get me a walker just to get around in the house. The next day I made an appointment to see Dr. Zamora because she was in one of my business groups. I was desperate to get rid of the pain I was experiencing and figured chiropractic couldn't hurt and maybe it could help.   I walked in her office in a lot of pain. I could hardly walk at all. On a scale of 1 to 10 my pain was a 12. I left much better than coming in. On a scale of 1 to 10 my pain was around an 8 however I still couldn't walk without a walker.   I continued to see Dr. Zamora and was finally able to get on a cane and over time ( a lot less than I thought it would take) I was off the Cain and walking again. I am VERY thankful I decided to go to her. She is fantastic, caring and very informative about your health & well being.

Barter is a great concept. Using it has saved me a lot of money over the years, and I do mean a lot.   I have used barter to do a complete wedding and I do mean complete. We used it for the Catering, photographer, Tuxedo rental, Hairdresser, Limo, hotel, DJ, table rental, flowers etc. We have also used it to get our house painted (Exterior and  Interior) we had our yard landscaped, hired a Interior Designer for our house, got concrete planters for our yard, had our palm trees trimmed, got a computer and a laptop on barter, flowers for my wife and so much more.   In addition we use barter dollars to eat out, have got hot air balloon rides, golf packages, spa packages,  gone shopping for Mothers Day, Valentine's Day , Christmas and other special occassions. When family has come to town I was able to put them up in a hotel. Plus my wife gets her hair done every week on barter.   It never ceases to amaze me that people say they rack up a lot of barter dollars but can't use them.  Especially considering there is an immediate increase in cash flow when you use barter for expenses that would otherwise be paid for in cash.  I have always been able to find something on bater that I would have paid cash for saving me well over $45,000.00 over the years I have been with VCA.  Who can benefit from barter?  Any business owner, professional or individual who has a product or service to offer on trade.  The higher the demand for Your product or service the more opportunities you will have to trade for the products and services You want and need.  The best part is VCA fees are some of the lowest in Arizona. I would definitely recommend them.

I heard this place is similar to Chipotle.  Believe it or not we have never been to Chipotle. My wife nd got us both a Rumba Burrito with shreded beef (that was tender but not real flavorful), beans, rice and mango salsa.  Its not the best Mexican food,  that's because it is a fast food type restaurant. It is clean, has large portions, clean tables, decent prices. with plenty of parking. What more can you ask for?  As stated in another one of my earlier reviews regarding Mexican food. "I pretty much judge a Mexican restaurant on how their salsa tastes". Cafe Rumba's mild red salsa was to my suprise tasty. Their mango salsa was simply awesome. My only complaint was there wasn't enough of either one of them.   FOOD: Super sized and fulfilling. They made sure you did not go home un-satisfied and hungry. PRICE: The prices were good for what you got! SERVICE: Staff was nice, and the service was up to par AMBIENCE: Looks pretty much like a typical fast food restaurant. CONCLUSION: Limited, Straight forward menu. It's not the greatest food / restaurant but definitely not the worst. I'll give them another try for sure.

It's been a very long time since BBQ has excited me, Pork on a Fork did that for me !  I like BBQ, but I am picky. I usually dislike the sauce and I love their BBQ sauce.  I found this place through Value Card Alliance Barter Group.  Actually I had to visit a couple times to ensure that the BBQ is consistently good - and it is.  In fact writing this review I find myself jones-ing for it . Their meat is so tender it melts in your mouth.   If you're in Phoenix, you MUST go here. It is some of the BEST BBQ ever. The cornbread was great. The sides were amazing (mac n' cheese, baked beans, potato salad, and sweet potato fries)!   I had their "Smokin Sampler" with smoked sausage, my wife tried the "Smokin Sampler"  with the brisket. The brisket was outstanding! It was simply great - lean and had a nice smokey flavor .   The food is reasonably priced and EXCELLENT! DELICIOUS BBQ  Honestly can't think of anything negative about this place. Simply said, Pork on a Fork is perfect. PERFECT PERFECT PERFECT! if you even kinda like BBQ, you have to stop in for a meal.  Oh yah the service is very friendly too.    RATING: I highly recommend Pork on a Fork. Why because in short the barbecue is amazing and I have to say they were an unexpected pleasure. To say this place is delicious is a complete understatement . OMG...they are so good eat here or regret that you didn't.  For me, this is the epitome of the BBQ experience and to be honest, I struggled with the decision of whether to give this place a 4 or a 5 star rating.

My wife went to Pork on a Fork tonight for some take out for me and my grandson since she was going out tonight with the girls for Karaoke.  My grandson got the brisket with a side of Mac & Cheese and waffel fries. I had the BBQ Baby Back Ribs with a side of macaroni salad & BBQ beans.   Keep in mind, I'm not expert on BBQ. But I know food and what I like. The best part is I love giving awesome reviews!  All I can say about my meal is OMG the ribs were sooooooooooooooo good. Imean down right delicious!!!  Not at all greasy . Besides the BBQ ribs the best surprise was the Baked beans, they were great and cooked to perfection, smoky / sweet--simply all around fantastic.  To be honest Just writing this review is making me hungry again for more ribs.    FOOD:  Pork ribs just fell off the bone they had just the right amount of smoke, moisture, glaze and tenderness without being fatty.  Excellent sauce This is good BBQ... I mean really good. The sauce perfectly complements the meat. SERVICE: When I called in the order I was told the ribs were cooking and they would be ready in 1-1/2 hours. They were done exactly on time as promised. CONCLUSION: Isn't all barbeque supposed to be like this. Don't bother with all the other bbq places, just come here.

My wife & I ordered take out tonight from here we both ordered the BBQ pork burrito with the cornbread as a side.   Upon opening the box the aroma of the BBQ pulled pork permeated the room right away. The burrito was very large with a tortilla that was bulging from the pulled pork inside.   As my wife & I took our first bites we both looked at each other acknowledging our approval of how delicious the burrito was.  My pulled pork was juicy, well seasoned, incredibly moist and tender with a whole lot of awesomeness. It had an amazing Smokey flavor and the extra side if BBQ sauce was really good. Both meals came with cornbread which was the perfect addition to the burrito.   FOOD: Great BBQ - Love the tangy/sweet sauce , The food is incredible. I really enjoyed my meal.  SERVICE:  The staff is always very pleasant. PRICE: The price is entirely on-point.  For the quality of food you receive, which is one of the best BBQ places I've tried in Phoenix. The food is worth every penny...and probably a little bit more.  I have never been disappointed here. CONCLUSION: One of the best BBQ places we have tried.  RETURN FACTOR 100%.         ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************  5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well!  4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business.  3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average.

I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH

I decided to go to this restaurant for lunch with my wife, a friend of ours and my grandson. It was quiet only a few other people were there.  Before I start I would  like to say that I'm not the kind of person to send my food back or complain in restaurants.  The service was excellent. Our waitress was attentive, polite and willing to please even with all the complaints we had. But it was way over priced for what you get. Lunch for the four of us with our entrees, four desserts  a ice tea and three cokes was $127.00 And this was with  two lasagnas taken off the bill. *see below).  To start off my experience I ordered the ice tea. It was old and tasted nasty. So I sent it back. I noticed a party next to us also sent their tea back as well.  Next was the dinner salad which my self and our guest ordered. It was ok. My wife ordered the Caesar Salad, she thought it tasted odd so she did'nt eat it.   Next I had the French onion soup my wife had the corn chowder both of which was delicious. My wife had to send hers back because her soup was barely warm. The waitress took it back and nuked it for 30 seconds and when it returned it of course very hot. My soup was nice and hot.  For my entree I had the prime rib my grandson had a  Frenh Dip sandwich my wife and our guest had the Vegetarian lasagna. My grandson liked his sandwich. Although he said It was ok. Nothing spectacular.  However both my wife and our guest ended up sending their meals back. They both thought the lagsagna tasted odd and was greasy. Maybe it was the sauce they used or spices but they did not like it at all. In fact they both ended up ordering another soup because the food that came out was not good at all.  I ordered my prime rib medium. When I ordered it the waitress did not ask me how I wanted it so I got her attention and told her I wanted it  medium. It came out well done and was VERY dry. So I sent it back. Like I said normally I'm not the kind of person to send my food back or complain but this place was very expensive. My prime rib was $29.00 when it came out again it was  dry/ & overcooked it was more well done than medium. I ate a few bites and took the rest home for my dog.   FYI the French Dip -sandwich was $14.00 the lasagna was $11.00 the soup $5.00 (well worth it). Total bill, and this is for lunch.$127.00 -ouch. The food was mediocre, and below average quality .   ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************  5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well!  4 stars - Highly Recommended.

For the Preamble I decided to give this place a second chance because I know some people that patronized this restaurant and really enjoyed it. Everyone deserves a second chance.  I went here with my wife and our friend Billie Sue.  I would like to acknowledge the service here. We walked in without a reservation and was seated immediately because we went there midday so there was no crowd. After being seated our waitress Vanessa took our beverage order and gave us ample time to review the menu and select our entrees.   We started our meal off with an appetizer of Calamari Provencal - made with fresh Herbs, diced Tomato, tossed in Lemon Butter. The lemon butter sauce stole the show here. I would have totally licked my plate to get every last drop it was so good. My wife loved it and like me commented how delicious the lemon butter sauce was. Our friend Billie Sue never tried calamari and was apprehensive about tasting it. One bite and she was hooked.   Next up my wife and I got a dinner salad. It had a Balsamic Hazelnut Vinaigrette that was amazing delicious. For our entrees our friend ordered tilapia - Sautéed Tilapia, Flour Dusted, Smashed Red Potatoes, Carrots, Asparagus, in Lemon Beurre Blanc. She really enjoyed it and offered my wife a bite to try it. My wife told Bilie Sue she didn't like tilapia but Billie Sue insisted she try it. Guess what my wife thought it was remarkably tasty.  For our entrees my wife and I ordered the halibut. This dish was truly the highlight of the of our visit. The halibut was beautifully served in addition to being moist and tender. "Magnifique" !!  We finished off our meals with dessert. Billie Sue decided on the Tiramisu Carol and I ordered the Carmel Cheesecake. I normally don't order desserts or sweets, but the cheese cake was calling my name. It was divine. words cannot describe how stupendous this dessert is.   FOOD:  Was super scrumptious. The flavors and texture combined perfectly without overwhelming any of the fish dishes.  The portions look small, but they aren't that small as you dig in. We all left the restaurant very satisfied and full. The food is fantastic, everything we ordered was tasty and exceeded our expectations. AMBIANCE: Rustic atmosphere. If you have people visiting from out of town, you should take them here. Its a unique experience that everyone should know about! PRICE: The prices are real reasonable for French food. The bill for the three of us came to $133.42. SERVICE: I cannot emphasize enough the wonderful service experience we got from Vanessa. The service here is top notch and extremely attentive. Vanessa was polite, professional, and courteous. CONCLUSION: If the way to that special someone's heart is through their stomach, take them to Café Provence and they'll fall madly in love with you. This snug, lovely restaurant offers an intimate alternative to the rest of the restaurants we normally frequent.  Perfect unpretentious French restaurant that offers excellent service and affordable prices. Café Provence s definitely deserves the high praise. I will be most certainly coming back, hungry and yearning for more! RETURN FACTOR: 100%  *************** What does my OVERALL rating mean?************************* 5  stars -Highly recommended.

This was our first time coming here but before I begin I must remind you even though this review is solely about our dining experience it is a coffee shop.  While no one ordered coffee the smell of fresh brewed coffee permeated  the air, and it smelt amazing.  Anyway my wife, our friend Kathy R. and my self stopped here for lunch.   Kathy ordered the Southwest Turkey wrap which consisted of : key, bacon, pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, ancho cilantro ranch dressing & served on ciabatta bread but instead of the ciabatta she had hers on honey wheat wrap.` She said the meat stays juicy and shows lots of explosive savory and spicy seasoning. The vegetables are fresh and crisp  and a had a bit of a spicy taste to it.  She discribed it as a bit "fiery". Her choice of a side was the potato salad. She had an ice tea as her drink selection. She said the sandwich and potato salad was delicious.    My wife Carol got the Gobbler it had turkey, havarti cheese, cream cheese, cranberry sauce, spring mix & served on pumpernickel bread. I coud tell she enjoyed it by the fact she at the whole thing rather quickly. Sure enough she said the combination of ingredients and the flavors were wonderful.   Now for  me, I had the Raspberry Turkey Havarti Wrap. It had turkey, havarti cheese, lettuce/red cabbage mix, dried cranberries, raspberry vinaigrette & was  served on a honey wheat wrap. For my side I had mandarin oranges.  I have to tell you my sandwich had all fresh ingredients, the meats were all very tasty. The lettuce / cabbage was fresh  and crispy. The havarti cheese that was on it came through in every bite. It was simply scrumptious, very filling, tasty and refreshing. They are made with solid outstanding ingredients.  FOOD: In my humble opinion, the sandwiches here are absolutely delicious. Amazing food for such a low price considering what you get. Their sandwiches are unique becuse they use a lot of different ingredients in them not normally found in a sandwich. PRICE: Inexpensive prices / sandwiches! In fact I was floored by how reasonable they  were. SERVICE:  Our server was very knowledgeable & friendly. AMBIANCE:  Typical coffee shop /  atmosphere. It is a comfortable space with plenty of room to sit, work  with ample space for studying or to socialize.  CONCLUSION: I will be coming back. RETURN FACTOR: 100 %

I have been coming to Union Hills Ace Hardware for years.  There's just something about  shopping in a neighborhood hardware store. Anytime I have a project, I just go in and tell the guys behind the counter and they seem to always now how to fix it and have exactly what I need.  They provide personal, knowledgable help, If you are need of help or something unusual, or difficult come in and ask them.  They either have the part or they can point you in the right direction on where to go fix it!  I have always been greeted immediately and shown where to get my products. They have everything, and they're very knowledgeable about what products would be best.   It's run like a hardware store should be run.  And it's not just the selection, it's the customer service that won me over someone asks if they can help you with anything. They always take the time to actually walk me through the store to find what I'm looking for, and talk me through the different options. The best part is if you don't need help, they're nice and they leave you alone.  PRICE: Decently priced. You will not find these prices for the quality anywhere. SERVICE: The staff is super friendly and helpful. On each visit, we were met with THE most competent, friendly, intelligent, efficient and awesome service EVER. They take pride in their work.  SELECTION: The aisles are wide, the shelves are not overcrowded, and the store is impressively clean and maintained. They CONCLUSION: A bit more pricier than the big-box stores but they will actually have what you need and help you find it. l will continue coming here for all of my hardware needs just based on the friendly staff and their willingness to help.

============ WORST RESTAURANT ENCOUNTER TO DATE ============  10/31/13 - To be brutally honest It's not every day that you have your worst restaurant experience ever. Mine happened tonight. I've had a lot of bad experiences in restaurants but this one experience tops them all. in fact none of my previous bad experiences even compare to what I'm going to tell you now and that is out of all the 64 restaurants I have visited and reviewed so far.   This being said I drove a little more than a half hour to Cave Creek with my wife Carol, Grandson Michael, my sister Mindy her husband Jon and his brother Howard to get here.   Our waiter Matt took a while to take our drink orders then once he delivered them to our table and then took our dinner order. He wasn't seen or heard of again for at least 24 minutes. We didn't realize this at first because we were all talking.   Two people in our party wanted beef ribs but they were told there was none. Our order was as follows: 2 filet mignon (medium) 2 rib eye steaks (medium) 2 pork ribs and 1 corn bread. Once our food came out things went down hill from there. First off our waiter Matt couldn't tell the difference between a filet mignon and a rib eye steak so he placed the wrong entrees in front of the wrong people.   One rib eye went to my sister it was more on the well done side than medium but she ate it and said it was delicious. The other rib eye went to my grandson. He asked before he ordered it he asked if it was fatty and the waiter told him no. Well it was in fact half it wasn't edible because there was that much fat on it. Then my grandson asked 5 times for A-1 sauce and was ignored. He finally stood up  as Matt was walking by and said he wanted to talk to him and was told to sit down and just relax for a while. My grandson replied he just wanted some A-1 Sauce before what was left of his meal got cold. My sister got up and went to the bar and asked for some A-1 sauce the bar tender handed her an empty bottle of A-1 sauce.    Mean time two people who ordered the filet mignon, me being one of them cut into our filet. Both were well done. I sent mine back but Howard didn't because he had to get on the road because he was going to Rocky Point. We asked to see the manager who came to our table dressed as a hippy wearing marijuana leaf glasses. She didn't introduce herself or remove her marijuana glasses as she spoke.. We explained to her our filets were well done and the problems we encountered and she offered to get me another one. When my filet came back the potato was so cold the butter wouldn't melt and the steak came back well done again.  Meanwhile the two people who ordered the pork ribs received their meals. Both pork rib dinner were lukewarm, the broccoli that came with them was cold and the potatoes were warm. My wife opt'd not to eat her meal because she like her food hot. So once again we called the manager to our table who was in a defensive mode, crossing her arms as she spoke.   We also told her how the bartender refused to serve my grandson (22) another beer stating he already had two drinks within a half hour. I never heard of this before so we told her he isn't driving but she still said no. We told all this to the manager who ended up giving us a comp on one steak dinner and an additional 15% off our bill which ended up being $135.00 after every thing she did. They even added a 16% tip to the bill.    FOOD: Food Is terrible. Very disappointed.  SERVICE: Worst service I have experience so far. PRICE: The price was in line with other BBQ touristy restaurants / steakhouses.  I would say they were even on the high side. AMBIANCE: Rustic western steakhouse atmosphere. CONCLUSION: Needless to say I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone!!!!  This place  is a joke. If you want to go eat at a restaurant where they couldn't care less, then try it out for yourself. RETURN FACTOR 0%. Bottom line don't waste your money.  ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************  5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well!  4 stars - Highly Recommended.

My sister called and spoke to the owners wife the day after this happened and told her I wanted some sort of compensation. The owners wife said she wanted all of us to come back. My sister explained she was from Rhode Island so that wouldn't be possible. Anyway we never heard from anyone... Just thought everyone should know.

I know this review is on the long side and naturally there's lots of excitement that comes with trying something new. I Came here today for the first time and have to say that this is my new favorite breakfast / lunch place in Anthem!   Went here for lunch on Saturday there was four of us in our party. My wife, me, a close friend and my grandson.  Everything is so fresh, flavorful, and huge so what is there to NOT like about that.  First off we were greeted by the most friendly waitress I have encountered in a long time. Her name was Angelia. The service and atmosphere was so good. I gave this pplace 5 stars. Angelia took our drink order and allowed us to take our time ordering.   Our friend ordered eggs Benedict. She said the Eggs Benedict  was fantastic (and obviously so by her clean plate).   My wife ordered the Ruben. She said it was wonderful,flavorful, and jdelicious!! It was amply stacked with fresh ingredients.  I got the Greek Salad  along with a bowl of Chicken Vegetable / rice soup. Both the Greek Salad and soup portions are was very generous. So much so I ended up taking most off my salad home. I left so full.  Now for my grandson's order. My grandson doesn't like eggs. Yet he ordered a breakfast omelet sandwich without the egg. When he asked Angelia if it would be OK to get it in a wrap with no egg she said no problem. He was a bit picky with how he wanted the wrap made and Angelia was nothing but accomidating. She showed real concern for her customer's happiness.  My wife, grandson and our friend all finished off their meals with dessert. My wife and our friend got a slice of home made mouth watering pie. Simply said they have great pies. My grandson & I both took home a large muffin.  I Would definitely recommend this cute cafe. I gave this restaurant five stars because the service was amazing. This place gets full marks for customer service. The people there are super nice, energetic, and happy to have your business. Some places just 'have it' and this place "has it". Will definitely go back here in the future. This is a wonderful family run business, that is super friendly and clean. Trust me I'll be back. You can't go wrong.

My wife and I decided to visit Cafe Aroma again. We hoped like our visit this time around would be a similar experience. We weren't dissapointed.  This place is a rarity in these times. By that I mean it is family run. On this visit we had the pleasure of meeting the owners Arlin & Nickie. They were very pleasant & friendly.   As far as breakfast goes, I'm not a big fan and normally I don't get breakfast at a restaurant because somehow most places I go to botch it up. Thank goodness this spot is not one to follow suite.   First off I want to say our server Monik she was friendly and attentive and totally on top of things and kept popping back to check on water levels, coffee refills, etc.   My wife feels that a good breakfast needs good coffee and their coffee passed her test.  She ordered the THE CLASSIC which was 2 eggs over medium, sausage links-patties, with a side of their Buttermilk Biscuits smothered with homemade sausage gravy. My wife said her eggs was cooked to perfection. By her satisfied expression, she reveled in the goodness of her choices made at breakfast.   As for me I'm not a foodie. But I like good food, I know what I like and there's plenty here. I ordered the 2X4 (2 eggs over easy, 2 strips of Bacon, 2 sausage links, 2 Buttermilk Pancakes with a side order of cornbeef hash). I loved the pancakes - great consistency and flavor - and the perfect size.   One last thing on Sunday they have a Variety Show featuring local talent from 12-close. My wife and I stayed for the show. First up was Dr. Lawrence Stern of Arizona Eyecare followed by the Red Sky Esemble. The avergae age of the group was 16. They were very entertaining, talented young men. So if you have a special musical talent like original monologues, comedy routine, poetry, singing, dancing, playing an instrument acting talent ect. then show it off. Consider auditioning for the Variety Show at Cafe Aroma. For more info please contact Cafe Aroma @ 623-551-1500   FOOD: The food taste more homemade, Reminds me of an old town restaurant. They made sure you did not go home un-satisfied and hungry. SERVICE: Like our last visit the way service should be. Friendly and warm. CONCLUSION: Cafe Aroma is the best kept secret around. Everything from breakfast to lunch to their Sunday Variety Show ... One word: AMAZING. So go here. Seriously, just do it. Don't think about it, Just go.

Third time's a charm.... My wife & I went back to Cafe Aroma for lunch today. My wife ordered the  1/2 lb. Avocado Cheese Burger with French fries. She took her first bite and said "This is one of the best burgers I've had in years". It is so moist, tender and tastey. And the buns are perfect. PERFECT! She said here have a bite you need to taste this.   My, oh my, I thought to myself, this is one tasty burger. Moist without being greasy and the meat was seasoned "just right" . Delicious and exploding with flavor. I wouldn't say this place has the best burgers. But they are right up there for sure. I don't know how to best describe the "bun" the burger was on but it was incredible.  Then my wife says she wanted me to taste her French fries. The fries were amazing.  Seriously some of the best french fries I've ever had.  The outside of the fry was crisp, and then it was soft and potatoey on the inside.  They were also salted just perfectly.  Now for my order: I started my meal off with the French Onion Soup. One taste and I could tell it was good but it was warm, not hot. I like hot soup so I sent it back to be nuked. When it returned it was just right. Next I had the Arizona wrap with a side salad. The Arizona wrap is a grilled chicken Breast, with lettuce, tomato, onion, olives feta cheese and a house dressing.    The Arizona wrap was well prepared. I was pleasantly surprised. It was simply a breath of fresh sandwichy  /wrap air. What made this particular wrap so great was that all of the ingredients were extremely fresh, not to mention the Romaine Lettuce provided a subtle crunchy texture contrast that but the sandwich wrap over the top.  The wrap itself contained mild flavoring, which greatly supported the subtle nature of the greens used in the wrap. I had no complaints, except that I couldn't finish it all, but that's a personal problem. : -)   FOOD:  Fresh and flavorful and that's the way every restaurant should be. Do a few things, but do them really, really, really well... Soooo delicious oh and the portions are right on the dot. PRICE: Decently priced. You will not find these prices for the quality anywhere. SERVICE: The service was impeccable.  CONCLUSION:  I am extremely confident that you can visit this place, enjoy a meal, and feel that you didn't throw your money away. It is perfect for that nice day out if you're looking for something delicious. This place is not in my neighborhood, but we'll continue to make the drive out there again and again.

Buffet has all the typical offerings of your local Chinese buffet, I was disappointed at how MOST of the food was room temperature. The food that was supposed be hot was warm with the exception of the soups, they were piping hot. Maybe it was the time  of day that I came in because I heard good things about this restaurant.  I know the first time I was there (when it first opened, it was excellent. The food was hot and delicious). Not on my second and third trip there. I even tried their restaurant on 51st & Bell before they closed. That one was even worse than the one at Metro which is why it may no longer be in business. I don't know why I kept going back. Maybe the buffet looked so tempting and the restaurant was crowded I thought something isn't right or it must be me. I do know if you can catch the dishes as they come out of the kitchen  when they come out fresh they are very good.  But this place reminds me of all the other C - rated Chinese buffets in Phoenix. I'm generally not a fan of buffets and Hibachi Grill & Supreme Buffet is nothing special. it is typical of the buffets here, you get what you pay for but the food looks good and they have a lot of choices (a wide selection) so everyone will eventually find something they want to eat there if you can stomached warm - cold food that is supposed to be hot. But it is it's all you can eat.   The last time I went here with my wife I walked around the buffet once, walked around twice... and walked around one last time and NOTHING looked appetizing at all!  I ended up having soup because I could see the steam coming from it and knew it would be hot. .   We should've known better, judging from the demographics of the place.  I shouldn't have given them additional chances and just got the heck out!   CUSTOMER SERVICE:  Is average, they'll do their job like any other buffet restaurant. AMBIANCE: The buffet presentation is very basic, Once you walk in, one side has all the food and kitchen area, the other side is tables and chairs, and booths. FOOD: The food experience was just that- an 'experience. Frankly the health department should really come in and take a look at the food temperatures of the buffet. I am surprised people haven't got sick from food poisoning at this restaurant!  CONCLUSION: I'm writing out of disappointment for wasting $$ at this place. One star is way too generous, more like ZERO star.

My wife Carol & I came here today for a late lunch (around 3pm) the place was empty we were shown to a table by the hostess then we sat waiting for someone to take our drink and food order. Finally a gal came over and asked if anyone has waited on us. We told her no. She took our drink order and asked if we knew what we wanted to eat. We told her we were ready to order.   We got an order of calamari for our appetizer. Carol got chicken with Shiitake mushrooms, garlic mashed potatoes  and grilled zucchini. I got a steak with whiskey sauce, garlic mashed potatoes and grilled zucchini.   The calamari was extremely chewy and bland. The garlic sauce that came with it for dipping added nothing to it at all.  I took a few bites of my steak and that was it for me. The sauce was to sweet for my liking. I tried the garlic mashed potatoes and it had very little taste, frankly I stopped at one bite of it. The grilled zucchini was bland so I pushed my plate away from me because I had enough.  My wife tried her chicken and said it was dry so she asked for more garlic sauce. Our waitress brought it over but the chicken was so dry and just lukewarm so she didn't want another bite. She tried the mashed potatoes and agreed with me they had little to no taste and they weren't real hot. She did eat the zucchini though.  A different waitress came by and saw I didn't touch my meal and told me she would take it off my bill. She asked my wife if she wanted a box for hers. My wife replied no. My meal was taken off the bill but frankly we shouldn't have been charged for my wife's meal either because neither one of us really ate more than a few bites of our entrees.  FOOD: Reasonable portion sizes. I was not impressed. A good steak shouldn't be topped with a sauce. Chicken was dry (over cooked) Our food did arrive quickly. Almost to quick if you know what I mean. SERVICE: Considering the place was empty it could have been much better. CONCULSION: The burgers looked good so I may try them on another visit. If they aren't then I'm done.  RETURN FACTOR: 90%. ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************  5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well!  4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business.  3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again.  2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family.  1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT

==================== UNDER NEW OWNERSHIP=================  Right off I should known something was different. On their website it says "Taps is a chef-driven restaurant and bar that specializes in a friendly neighborhood approach to hospitality; from-scratch signature and creative cuisine". Looking at the menu all I saw was normal everyday bar food being offered, My wife & I came here today because we had a gift card. I mentioned I had a gift card to our server Page and she explained the bar is under new ownership and they are not taking the gift cards anymore.  Because we were hungry we decided to stay. Page was very attentive and brought us our drinks right away. She gave us ample time to peruse the menu and we both finally decided on a burger..  I asked that my burger to be cooked medium. My wife wanted her's medium rare. Both burger were brought to us well done. That being said before I sent it back I decided to try it. Like I said I was hungry. The burger actually tasted very good despite it being well done. It was thick, appetizing and juicy. My wife thought the same thing so we kept the burgers.   There was an odd flavor to both burgers we couldn't figure out. All I can say it was interesting.      --------------------------------------- OMG the fries   ---------------------------------------  One thing that is worth mentioning is their fries. I don't know about you but I love McDonalds fries. Normally restaurants don't even come close to their fries. Well Taps had fries that matched the look, taste and flavor as close to McDonalds that I have ever experienced. AMAZING!!    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    FOOD: The food is exactly what you would expect from bar.  SERVICE: Our waitress Page was friendly, professional and attentive. PRICE: The price  for the quality of food you receive is spot on.  AMBIANCE: Modern looking sports bar. They have a wine bar in the back (probably left from the previous owner). CONCLUSION: I think its a great little bar if you want to drink, mingle, or watch sports. RETURN FACTOR 100%.         ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************  5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business.

Dined here last night while attending a benefit comedy show the show started at 8pm so we arrived at 6:30 so we could talk and eat dinner.  When seated we immediately got water but then our waitress was no where to be found.  When we saw her again  we couldn't seem to get her attention. After a long wait we finally did by then several friends of ours who were also there early for dinner and the show, couldn't get service so I told her they wanted to orderr. With prompting she finally waited on their table as well.  Other friends of ours who were there for the show walked out because of the poor service because they were hungry and tired of waiting. THE SERVICE HERE WAS TERRIBLE ! We had to ask for everything from that point on because the waitress like in the review Pepper T. was alone so it wasn't her fault. The restaurant was warned that the place would be busy for the benefit and they only had one server on the floor.   There was three of us in my party. Kathy R. my wife and myself. We ordered coconut shrimp and spinach pies for appetizers. After a while the waitress informed us they were out of the coconut shrimp at that point we ordered our drinks since the waitress still hadn't asked what we wanted. I stuck with water my wife Carol got a coke and our friend Kathy R. ordered an ice tea.  Because we were there for the comedy show and we were visiting with a lot of people we knew before we realized it an hour had gone by and still no food yet people all around us were getting served. We ordered the Kafta Kabab ( $13.95 )  which was marinated ground beef mixed with minced onions and seasoning and Filet Mignon Kabob ( $16.95 ) Marinated Filet Mignon with grilled veggies. But after another hour waiting for our food there was still nothing. When we finally inquired where our food was we were told by the waitress she lost our ticket but our food was in the back and she would get it. More waiting and waiting and waiting. By now the comedy show started and it was 8pm and our food finally arrived.   Both of the Kababs were not hot they were warm, the meat was overcooked, dry and tough. I was expecting a flavorful Lebanese food , NOT!! Would have been much better warmer. The waitress never even asked how our food was. They get a single star only for the pita and the rice, beyond that.... fast food has a leg or two up on their food. Sad but true!   FOOD: The kebabs were dry and without much flavor. Overall a big waste of money. We left hungry, and needless to say I was pretty dissatisfied with the whole establishment, the food and can not recommend it. PRICE: Expensive for what you get. The food is my main complaint, which is pretty serious if the review is about a restaurant. SERVICE:  EXTREMELY SLOW !!. Obviously I'm waiting for my food and even after asking about it were still waiting.. but still no word... Seriously?  AMBIANCE:  Modern Middle eastern with plenty of room. Definitely NOT short on ambience. But my review is not about the ambience or the comedy show it's on the food there. CONCLUSION:I rate this place at a 1 Not worth wasting your money. We're never spending another penny at this place. Sad the first time I ate here and it will definitely be the very last RETURN FACTOR: 0  ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************  5 stars -Highly recommended.

OK OK I'm still on my health kick but I'm sure this will pass.... For this review  keep in mind this restaurant is a chain. Normally I don't care for chains because they put in countless hours to deliver the same average experience at each and every location, this restaurant is no different. Every Native New Yorker location is pretty much the same! .    Here is my review - First off there is nothing New York about this place other than the name. If you are going to call yourself Native New Yorker, be a New Yorker or at least give me some good old New York attitude. If your not going to give that East Coat attitude to people  then at least give us East Coast tastes.   There was three of us. My friend John V. My wife Carol and me.  John V got the Torpedo. My wife Carol got a  Extreme Cheese Burger. Both enjoyed their meal and ate everything on their plate. No left over or dogie bags for either of them. In addition everything was served promptly.  I ordered healthy. I got a Chicken Wrap. It was huge, It was kind like a salad. It had grilled chunks of chicken sitting on large lettuce leafs with chopped cabbage, & corn. Kind of like an Asian slaw with dressing. It was simply fantastic.  FOOD: Delicious food that is always consistent. PRICE: Decent prices. SERVICE: Our server was extremely pleasant, but we never did get his name. In fact the manager also stopped by and ask how our food was and he didn't introduce himself. AMBIANCE:  Typical sports bar atmosphere, lots of TVs all around the place.  It is a huge place where there is a bar area and the restaurant has plenty of booths and tables. CONCLUSION: Typical sports bar that  RETURN FACTOR: Definitely coming back! :)

I read about this place when it appeared in a ROTD (Review Of The Day)  So this is my first visit. I didn't know what to expect however I was excited to try this establishment because I love soup especially this time of year. There is nothing like a bowl of pho on a cold day. In addition it isn't that far from where I live.  I must say I'm quite impressed with this place. As you might know from reading my reviews I rarely give a restaurant a 5 rating. To get a 5 the food & service must be over the top. It must have that " Wow factor" and Pho Viet Vietnamese Restaurant has that wow factor. First off when my wife & I walked in we were  immediately greeted by the owner Nghi and our waiter Hong with a resounding "Happy New Year". The place wasn't busy so we were seated right away.  While my wife went to get my glasses that I left at our house I ordered our drinks (Root beer for Carol and hot tea for me). The first thing that impressed me with the tea it was made with real tea leaves instead of the tea being in bags. I then ordered us an appetizer of Cha Gio Eggrolls (Crispy rolls filled with pork, shrimp, crab meat served with vegetables).  I asked our waiter Hong what he recommended since this was our first visit here. He suggested the Pho Tai.   When Carol got back and tasted the Cha Gio Egg roll she raved about how tasty the egg roll was. I told her Hong suggested we get the Pho Tai (PHO noodle soup with sliced rare tender beef). We both ordered the Pho Tai. Carol  and I usually see eye to eye on most things taste-wise (food, music, etc.,) so I wasn't surprised she loved the food here especially the Pho. All I can say is the Pho here is awesome. The Pho broth was tasty and fresh and while at first glance the portions didn't look that big, the Pho was extremely filling. The beef in the Pho was tender In terms of taste, the Pho was delicious!  Plenty of noodles, fresh basil, bean sprouts and jalapenos and lime on the side. This even before you add Sriracha Sauce or Hoisin Sauce to the broth. The broth was just the right amount with a like amount of meat. The soup was actually good (not watered down) I was so full by the time I finished eating. If you want to leave a restaurant with a full belly and a smile on your face this is the place to be. I can definitely see myself becoming a regular here. They have a huge variety of Pho in addition to an extensive menu of Vietnamese dishes so the Pho is just one of the things that makes you want to come back.  To finish off my meal I got a Lychee smoothly.  It was outstanding. Plus they give you a large straw so you can slurp down every delicious drop.   FOOD: Everything was cooked to perfection I thought my mouth was having a PHO party. The Pho was so flavorful the broth warmed my belly with delight. It was soooooooooooooooooooooo good. AMBIANCE/ DECORE: Very modern and clean interior. SERVICE: I KID YOU NOT, there are Vietnamese restaurants out there providing excellent customer service.  And Pho Viet Vietnamese Restaurant is one of them. CONCLUSION: Hungry? Do you like Vietnamese food? Of course you do, who doesn't like pho, right? This place is nice & clean and plenty of parking. The service was excellent and the food came out pretty fast. The staff also seemed very nice. The décor was awesome and the prices were good too. What else do you want from a restaurant. I will be returning here to try their other delicacies! RETURN FACTOR: 100%   ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************  5 stars -Highly recommended.

I told you I wanted to become a regular here so here I am again with my wife. Immediately upon entering Nghi (the owner) thanked me for my review and welcomed us back. Other than the gal behind the counter who was there during our last visit  everyone there was all different. None of which introduced themselves. I must say I was a slightly disappointed about this. That being said I must admit ALL of them were extremely attentive and helpful. Especially (I'll call her the gal behind the counter since I don't know her name).  We started off with an appetizer of Cha Gio Egg rolls. We both totally enjoyed them. In fact this is the second time we ordered them.  Anyway after (the gal behind the counter) made several suggestions we finally ordered the Cha Gio eggrolls again. For our entrees my wife Carol got root beer then ordered Bun Thit  Nuong (Grilled pork , egg roll, lettuce, mint, bean sprouts. She moderately liked it. But thought it was just OK. She enjoyed the Pho much better.   I ordered hot tea and for entrée I ordered the Com Thit Nuong, Bi, Cha, Tau Hu Ky (Grilled Pork, Vietnamese meatloaf, shrimp paste over steamed rice. Like my wife Carol I thought it was OK but liked the Pho much better.   After my meal I got a Mocha smoothie with Boba. I didn't like the Boba all that well so next time I'll just skip it.  FOOD: Everything was fine but not my favorite dishes . I liked the Pho much better. AMBIANCE/ DECORE: Very modern and clean interior. SERVICE: Outstanding. Everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service.  CONCLUSION: Very filling meals. This restaurant is spotless. The prices are excellent. What else do you want from a restaurant. I will be returning here to try their other delicacies! RETURN FACTOR: 100%   ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************  5 stars -Highly recommended.

My wife & I have eaten here several times  since our first visit. Each time I have tried something different. My wife Carol gets her favorite PHO Soup. But I must say it is the PHO and the spectacular service that keeps us coming back again and again.     Each time we bring new people who haven't tried Pho Viet Restaurant yet and they all liked it a lot.   FOOD: PHO is delicious. AMBIANCE/ DECORE: Very modern and clean interior. SERVICE: Outstanding.

Since PHO's menu is so extensive I can always try some thing differed  to eat and that is always mouth watering bowl of PHO that is guaranteed  to  satisfy . Especially when suggested by the son of the owner. Every suggestion by him has be short of amazing. YES were hooked on this place,  yes were regulars, there, yes we know every one there. and yes this is out favorite Vietnamese restaurant in town.  Peter the owners son ha even made suggestions to try different n00dles to replace the ones that cone with them and all I can say is each time he does the soup gets better ad better!   FOOD: PHO is delicious. AMBIANCE/ DECORE: Very modern. Exceptionally clean.  Bathrooms are very clean,.SERVICE: Outstanding. Everyone is very attentive, providing  excellent customer service.  CONCLUSION: Very filling meals. This restaurant is spotless. The prices are excellent. What else do you want from a restaurant. I will be returning here to try their other delicacies!

Saturday night (late) I was getting warm when I checked the thermostat to see if the central AC was on and yes it was, but it was blowing warm air. Oh no! So now my air conditioning decided the day it was 109 degrees to stop working  I called Sunday afternoon and spoke with Mark I  told him about the issue with my AC and he said the earliest he could get here was sometime Monday. I was fine with that even tough it was 98 degrees in the house. My wife and I were OK but a bit worried about our dogs and how they would take the heat.  Amy ( Marks wife called this morning to confirm that I would be home. Mark came around 12:10 asked a few questions, and went right to work. After diagnosing the problem, he came back, and told us what was wrong, what needed to be done, and the cost to have it repaired. I agreed to the repair. About 1 hour later he was done! I believe he was here for a total of thirty minutes and my central air conditioning unit is now working and blowing cold air. Happy dance!!!  He located, tested, and fixed the problem (Bad Capacitor) quickly and efficiently. I can sit back now and relax in my fully air-conditioned house and enjoy the cool air as I write this review.  PRICE: No hidden or extra fees for an estimate, just the cost of the repair.  SERVICE: Mark is very professional. Overall, this company was as good as you could ask for.  CONCLUSION:  They were prompt, thorough and affordable and Highly recommend. In fact Yelp readers: look no further, this is a quality, ethical, reasonably priced A/C service. Could not be happier.

A  5 star rating is rare for me but The Tennenessee Grill more than deserves it. I had the pleasure of meeting the owner "Bob Adler". Talking to  Bob I was impressed with his pride of ownership in his restaurant and pride in the quality of the food he serves to his customers.   There was four of us. Friend Kathy  R. , My wife,  and 14 yr old grandson Christopher and me. Kathy R.  ordered a Burger - She said her burger was cooked to perfection. It was juicy, tasty and the bun was just delicious, the lettuce was crisp and the tomato was cut in nice thick slices. Her comment regarding the burger was " It was the best burger she had in ages".   My wife ordered a Chicago Patty Melt. She commented that the burger was juicy and cooked just  right. She went on to say the bun was fantastic- definitely held its own with all the condiment. She also commented on the fries. She said her fries were really good and that they had just the right amount of salt and crunch.   My 14 year old grandson got a cheese omelet. He seemed to ehjoy it.   Ok now for my meal. I started with French Onion Soup (came with the sandwhich)  . Followed by a vegetarian wrap.What I like about the sandwich was that it was SIMPLE.  veggies that was incredibly juicy and tender and oozed with a well balanced flavor. Sandwiches were phenomenal and packed with flavor.  I have to say what a delightful experience.  I don't normally indulge in dessert at lunchtime but none of us could resist.For desert Kathy and I had their chocolate cake. It wasn't sickening sweet like most resturants or bakeries serve. It tasted more on the coco side and was  amazingly delisious. Carol got a slice of blueberry pie. The crust was just the right consistency and the slice was huge.  The thing that sent my experience over the top was we were given a sample of the pulled chicken sandwhich on a pretzel roll. We were informed along with their pulled pork sandwhich it was one of their signature dishes. All I can say HANDS DOWN THE BEST BBQ I HAVE EVER HAD! Lots of flavor especially their home made BBQ sauce. It was very tasty, had a sweetness to it yet had a nice tang to it. There is some real magic here.  Bob also told us about his future plans for the place which sounded very exciting.  FOOD:  Definitely a wow factor here. PRICE: The prices are reasonable. SERVICE: The waitstaff is excellent,  efficient, and friendly.  AMBIENCE:  CONCLUSION: Food was awesome OMG GOODNESS!!!! Will definitely leave you full, and the presentation of the dishes is very nice. RETURN FACTOR: 100%   will definitely be back here.

Due to illness I haven't been back here since 7/30/13. So my wife Carol and I decided to take a ride and head up to Anthem for dinner. As I opened the door to the restaurant I was met by an odor that permeated the restaurant. It was the delicious aroma of barbeque. OMG it smelled so good. Not only that but as we entered I was immediately greeted by Bob Adler who said "Hello Morris".  To say I was shocked is an understatement because like I said I had not been back here since July. Talk about being impressed! This is just one reason I love this mom and pop establishment.  Anyway getting back to my review. My wife and I went there to try their all-you-can-eat fish. But that barbeque sure smelt good. In the end we both decided to try the fish.   Our entrées came with two side dishes.We had several choices for our side dish but we went with  cottage cheese and a dinner salad. The fish also came with two hush puppies.   Our waitress (I didn't get her name) was extremely friendly and attentive. After a bit Bob came over and asked how we liked the fish. I said "read about it on YELP". You should have seen his face. I let him hang and then told him what I thought.  The fish was moist, tender and flaky.They have their batter perfected. It was different from anything I've had before. I can't really describe it so you'll just have to try it. I can say it was crispy and oh so flavorful. The cod was cooked just right. Being cod you could tell it was fresh because it didn't taste fishy. It was wonderfully crispy and golden on the outside, fluffy as a pillow and moist on the inside.  Perfectly cooked fish   As we concluded our meal my wife decided to get a slice of their berry pie alamode (Vanilla Bean ice cream). I asked for an extra spoon so I could try a bite. The first thing that hit me about the pie is it tasted and looked "home made". It was divine. I mean it was mouthwatering scrumptious.  Back to that wonderful odor we smelt upon entering. We have to go back and try the barbeque. That smell was so tempting I have to try it so we'll be back.  FOOD: Portions are great, food taste spectacular. SERVICE: The customer service is so sincere and personable. CONCLUSION: As you know I rarely give a restaurant a 5 rating. They got a 5 from me last time I was there and I was pleased they still deserved a 5 again. To get that from me there has to be a WOW factor and this place has it. It is a relaxed place where you can enjoy a good meal with good friends. The best thing going for this place, after the food of course, is the owners. They are genuinely nice people and deserve your business. I'm definitely a fan. RETURN FACTOR: 100%]  ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************  5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well!  4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business.  3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again.  2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family.  1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT

I never imagined myself reviewing a gas station because how different can they get right? just grab your gas and go. But this neighborhood gas station is great. If you shop at Fry's you'll  get reward points for discounts at their gas station. Considering there is a Fry's grocery store a few blocks from my house so Fry's is my wife's #1 place to shop. This makes it very easy to accumulate rewards points.   I'd like to add this gas station is right by my house so I prefer to get my gas here. In addition I appreciate they have squeegees & paper towels to clean your windows. To top it all off you'll also find a tiny convenience store here with the basics.  Good customer service..   CONCLUSION: When using these reward points gas is inexpensive. Not much else can describe this station. So If you shop at Fry's it's worth using their gas stations.  what more needs to be said? RETURN FACTOR 100%.   ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************  5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business.
