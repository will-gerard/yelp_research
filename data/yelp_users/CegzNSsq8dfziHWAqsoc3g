We've come here for tattoos and piercings after going to some really crappy places! This place is very clean and the people are very friendly! I love that they text a few weeks after and ask if things are healing well! Won't go anywhere else!

We don't usually go to places like this but when we did last weekend we were impressed. The employees, especially Julia I think her name was, were really helpful and friendly! I felt like the place was being run by friends who were there to help us out. They got us what we came for and then some. We drove from Glendale to get what we needed and they really helped us out. Thank you so much, Julia! :D

Love love love!! This place is great! The drinks are yummy and the service is super!!  Last time I got an iced chai that was a little too spicy for my taste and this time I went the guy said he'd make it sweeter and if I didn't like it I wouldn't pay for it and he'd get me something else. I did like it and he gave me a coupon because I didn't like it last time.  Really generous, truly a servant.  Plus this place has such a great charm! Clean,

She did a little bit on my wedding dress and altered a bridesmaid dress for me and she's awesome! She is really funny and a pleasure to go see. My whole family goes to Q and only Q; we love her!

Great food. Crappy service.  We ordered. Then we checked out the coffee menu for forever, got coffees, drank the large coffees, searched through all the beer, went to the bathroom, and still waited for a long time to get our food! And we were the only ones there!! What takes so long?!  Every time I've been here I've waited for a long time. For drinks, food, and the check!  No thank you.

No, no, no. NO.  I went to see Superman recently. The showing was at 10:45 or something late like that. Anyways, I had THE WORST movie experience EVER. Let me tell you about it.  I brought about 10 people with me and we were REALLY excited about the movie. There was a girl sitting two seats away from me with a 3 or 4 year old little girl. (at 10:45pm? Come on) The little girl was running around the theater, going up to everyone and talking, dropping things, spilling drinks, etc... So the mom gives her an iPad and turns the volume up really loud... It's crazy bright and loud and SUPER distracting. It kept yelling out "STRAWBERRY" "GOOD JOB!" "DINOSAUR!" Guys, this went on the ENTIRE MOVIE! But this wasn't my main problem... Kids are kids and you really can't blame Westgate for bad parents and rowdy kids.  I got up to go tell someone that something needed to be done, I couldn't take anymore.  I WALKED AROUND FOR 30 MINUTES AND DIDN'T FIND ONE PERSON TO TALK TO! I was banging on doors that said "employees only", I was yelling asking if anyone was around... No one was anywhere! After 30 minutes a security guard comes around (I felt SO safe... not) and was able to track someone down.  When I told the manager that there were incredibly distracting people in the theater and asked for my money back, she got really annoyed and gave me a free pass.  That was my problem... There was no one around for way too long and then they got mad at ME... They had an opportunity to fix a bad experience and only made it worse.  I will never come back here again. Screw Westgate. NEVER AGAIN!  Oh and $6 for a kids popcorn? Are you kidding me?!

Me and 3 girlfriends went to see Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat last night and had the BEST time. The play was awesome, the food was delicious (I had chicken noodle soup and the vegetarian lasagna), the server was friendly and attentive... We all had such a great time! I can't wait to come back and see Seven Brides for Seven Brothers a the beginning of 2014!

We have been here twice now and we love coming! It's really far from our home in Glendale but the (truly) healthy options are worth the drive!

I can't get enough of this place! Aaron, the owner, is the nicest guy. He is really helpful and funny. And My favorite part about this place is their events. Love the open mic nights, love the poetry slams, love the storytelling nights... Love this place!

Desert Donuts is Arizona's Voodoo donuts... But fresher. Their version of the bacon maple donut is fantastic!  All their donuts are made right when you order them and are prepared the way you like it. That kind of freshness makes these donut creations all on their own level. They have bacon toppings, pretzels, sprinkles, nerds, dried fruit... This place is so good!  The service is top notch too! They walked us through the menu and explained everything thoroughly and well. We will be back. A lot.

Such a sweet staff! Every person here is genuinely helpful and not annoyed if you want to try absolutely everything and can't pronounce anything! :) they walk around with water cups and always aim to please. And of course their gelato is fantastic. Rich, creamy, frosty ;)
