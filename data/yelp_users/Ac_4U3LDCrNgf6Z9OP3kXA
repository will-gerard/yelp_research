I like PHX airport.  I find it easy to get through and logically laid out. Baggage is simple and I like that you can be picked up at each of the 4 Terminals instead of having to take a train to a main one.  I wish they had a few better eateries, but, hey, it's an airport. (Is there some kind of law that requires airports to provide shitty, over-priced food?)  Overall, an easy place to navigate.

BEWARE THE FISH MINT!!!!  This was a new experience for me. I've been to oh-so-many pho places all over the country, and not one of them used this traditional (but disgusting) herb called FISH MINT.  Spring rolls - basic - can't go wrong?  oh but it could...  Everyone kept tasting this fish taste and we thought maybe the shrimp had gone bad (we are in AZ, folks).  Then my friend's salad came out.  FISHY.  Then my bun.  I put all the leafy greens in there liberally (I do love my greens), and then I got this big mouthful of... ROTTEN FISH.  BLECH!!!!  I literally spit it out and almost gagged.  Finally I called the waiter over cuz I was bankin' on a free meal (what with the vegetables being left out with rotten fish, or something), and he just laughed and said, "Oh!  That's diep ca!  It's very good for you.  Some people don't like it... Next time we'll leave it out."  and that was that.  Ick.  Who likes the taste of rotten fish?  I actually like the taste of fish sauce, so it's not like I'm a total nay-sayer on all things fishy... but DAMN... that $h!t tasted NASTY.  I had to google it, cuz I thought he was just making it up.  But there really is an herb called FISH MINT.  BEWARE!!!  The Pho is safe.  Apparently they don't serve it with pho.

Buffet only on Friday!! And today is Wednesday :*(  I went based on other yelp reviews, and it was pretty good.  Not gourmet or anything, and it is a grocery store, but I tend to like this sort of thing and feel more at home, like you're at someone's house at the table in the kitchen.  I got the gyro plate with a few salads on the side.  It's reasonably priced and they serve it with warm pita bread.  Next time I will ask for more salads and less meat (just my personal preference), but everything was tasty. And the tsatziki sauce was yum yum yum.  I'll come back on Friday and check out the buffet.  (Only 12-4!)

Okay Baja Fresh, I like you.  But, I like Chipotle better.  I usually get some kind of salad bowl thingy from Chipotle, so I tried Baja's grilled chicken bowl, but it didn't really stand up.  It was just okay, but not great.  The grilled chicken was fresh, but I can't figure out what they put on it so that it came chargrilled orange. (?)  Strange, but the taste was okay.  The chips that come with every meal are pretty bland and seemed a bit stale.  There were some okay sauces on the salsa bar.  I did like that part, but the ones behind the counter at Chipotle are better.  And just in case you want Chipotle now, there is one in the same shopping center as this one. Ha.

It's a Starbucks.  It's not an outstanding one, but it doesn't suck. The baristas smile.  I've never had a screwed up order (but then again, I order tall Americanos.  If you screw that up, you have failed at life.)  It's the closest to my office. I can walk there. (unless it's one of THOSE days that Phoenix is trying to melt my shoes off.)  They also have a drive thru.

YAY for lunch served on a sushi "BOAT".  The Boat Special (or whatever it's called) includes a little sushi, sashimi, and salad and teriyaki whatever you like.  I personally think teriyaki sauce is too sweet, so I'll probably order it without sauce next time, but if you like teriyaki, you'll probably like it.  Everything was fresh and the service was decent.  Looking forward to more!

Perfection.  This place is small, impeccably clean, and there are cute drawings all over the walls of kids who have drawn a picture for the owner, Pinporn.  She is really personable, and the food is super fresh and nutritious.  (No heavy sauces, thank you!!)  I will be back for the homemade coconut ice cream.  ^^

This was a hard one to review for me.  First of all - FIVE BIG AWESOME STARS FOR THE FOOD!!!  This food is crazy delicious.  Like, just from one dish, I know all of the others are going to be on my most wanted list.  Everything is fresh, and well prepared, and so frickin' TASTY.  I would give more stars for the food.  I came in for breakfast on a Sunday morning and had the most tender, melt-in-your-mouth green chile pork scrambled into eggs and cheese, with a wonderful chunky biscuit, Liberty potatoes (think chunky potato-au-gratin but better), and I added a blueberry, bacon pancake on the side.  I could not have been more satisfied with the food.  However.  The service system is not my style. I give it 2.5 stars. Barely. Mostly because the awesomeness of the food should pair with some seriously awesome service.  In IHOP, I expect IHOP food and service, and one does not out-do the other.    But here you get down-home local goodness, matched with so-so service. It just doesn't compute.  You walk in.  Wait in a line of about 15+ people with only 1 cash register (this just seemed unnecessary.  why can't i just sit down and someone take my order like every other not-that-great restaurant?), and then random people bring out your food, and random people wander around the dining area looking more interested in cleaning off tables, than on actually serving the diners.  I had to ask like 3 "dining room attendants" for the same thing (just some salsa) before one of them actually returned after I'd basically finished. But I had barely left my seat when they were already clearing off my dishes. The service vibe just didn't go with the great food, decor and build up.  I guess it's all about expectation.  If I'd read more reviews I would have known and maybe not have been so disappointed, but still.  This food DESERVES good service.  Definitely eat here, but don't expect personal dining service.

Yes!  I like this place.  I happened to arrive just a few minutes before 5:30, and there was already a line of people waiting for them to unlock the door!  They have their sushi specials presented on a plate near the entrance so you can see what the daily goodness is right away.  I liked the service, atmosphere, and most of all, the sushi.  Fresh and yummy.  I think there's a special if you buy one of the big japanese beers, you can get an app for 99 cents.  Nice!

I like this gym. It's close by, it's open at ridiculous hours when one should be sleeping, but for some reason I want to be swimming or "playing" basketball (usually that consists of me missing the shot and running around the court chasing the ball, but at least it's 2:00am in the morning and no one else is around!!)  And it's not fancy schmancy so I don't have to try too hard. ha.  I've found it to be pretty clean, and I like the front desk staff.  I've only tried one of the group Zumba classes because my friend was into it, but it's not really my thing.  But I hear that the classes are well-attended, so if you like the group exercise dynamic they're probably good.

5 stars for the GELATO!!!!!!!!  Market and swanky dining room.  Everything I ate was delicious and thoughtful.  My heirloom tomato salad was kind of funny, though.  There were multi colored hunks of tomato (which were superbly fresh and flavorful), chunks of avocado, big thick wedges of lettuce, and 2 bacon strips placed on top.  lol.  It was all amazingly fresh and tasty, but it was just funny.  It looked like they had forgotten to chop everything up and put it into a salad. I still loved it.  My friend's potatoe-y soup (cannot remember what it actually was) tasted flavorful and hearty.  All the bruschettas and breads with pesto were out of this world.  Great wines.  AND THEN.  $1.75 humongous cups of gelato.  With 3 flavors all tucked in there. And a shortbread cookie that made me weep tears of joy.  Seriously.  You can't even get the same amount of crappy froyo for $1.75.  Go eat the gelato.  Especially the PB&J flavor!!! AAAAHHH!!! SO TASTY!!!!

5 STARS FOR THE HALFBAKED COOKIE AND ICECREAM DESSERT!  I know it's all about the pizza here, but honestly I can barely remember it after finishing with that halfbaked wonderfulness.  If you get it, SHARE it and definitely go half and half.  Half chocolate chip and half white chocolate macadamia nut cookies.  That being said.  We ordered the stuffed deep dish Numero-One-O pizza, and honestly although it was good, it was just TOO MUCH CHEESE. Once you slice into it, it BLEEDS CHEESE. Sorry to be gross, but the cheese was literally pouring over the side of the pizza tray.  I couldn't even get more than one slice down and I am a pizza eater.  Seriously.  I've won contests.  I will go for the thin crust pizzas next time and leave the massive stuffed pies for those who like their cheese through a straw.  Overall, great experience.  Our server was friendly and put up with my silliness and jokes and even threw in a few herself. We had drinks and wings to start with, so we didn't mind waiting the 45 minutes for the stuffed madness, and the whole evening was just as merry as could be.  But, I seriously think the cheese factor needs to be disclosed before allowing someone to order the stuffed pie.  Definitely will be back!

Chopped salads are YUMMY.  and bruschetta!??  soooooo good  i usually get a vegetable chopped salad and add chicken (omg, the avocado makes this thing), and a bowl of the tuscan tomato soup.  Great lunch, although I think the soup is a little too creamy for me, even though it tastes DEELICIOUS.  I haven't tried the pizzas, but they're on my list!

Yelp, I'm sorry.   I should've checked with you first before walking in here.  Clothes were cute but WAY overpriced, and the service was all over the place.  I don't usually yelp about clothing stores, but my experience was so interesting...  My friend and I just walked in to kill some time and basically play dress up.  At first the staff was OVERLY helpful (in a good way) and brought out shoes and accessories to match what we were trying on.    We were having a good time... until the close.  Because we were actually having a good time, my friend decided to buy a pricey dress and I was actually going to buy her accessories for her as a gift, since I was in the spirit, but then the service from this point went south so fast it made my head spin.   They offered a 10% discount with email signup, but then refused to give it on the spot and said we had to wait for the coupon in the mail.   So my friend was like, then I'll just come back tomorrow with the coupon.   That's when it went from friendly to icy.  My friend went back and forth with them for awhile, and I just completely lost interest in buying anything from them.  So weird!  They put so much energy into the sale and then just completely killed the mood at the last moment!  I had hoped it was just an off day or something, but I guess fellow yelpers feel kind of the same.  And, no, my friend is not going back for the dress.

I love Chris. New bff. Ha!  I walked in by a referral and these guys are solid. Honest, up front, no sketchy sales pitches.  My oil change was quoted at 24.99 and 24.99 it was. It always seems like jiffy tube quotes 24.99 and then it ends up being $60 bucks.  No such nonsense here!  Highly recommended!

I love this ghetto pizza palace.  They don't have menus (that I could see). It's on that kind of black marquee board with the white letters (you know, snack bar style).  The pizza was cheap, fast and the crust was crispy without being burnt, and the pepperoni and cheese melted wonderfully without being too salty.  I am SOOOOO glad I won over my friend's bid for Domino's.  ick.  Plus it's right by my office.  Yay!

Bread-eaters.  EAT HERE.  This bread is so fresh and tasty.  Try ANY of their soups in a bread bowl.  All of the soups are hearty and flavorful. The veggie chili is one of my faves.  The salads are pretty big and come with 2 huge chunks of bread.  Everything comes with bread!  Also give them a try for breakfast.  I usually get this egg, brie and apple frittata thing that is sooooo yummy.  And the coffee bar is pretty good too.

Um. What did I miss?  They have such great reviews but my experience was just "meh".  I provably should have known better then to order entrée seafood at a fast food type place, but the picture was really appetizing!  Volcano blackened mahi. Waaaaay too salty. Had to scrape off most of it. The fish underneath was OK fresh. Not ocean fresh, but Arizona fresh. :-)  I had veggies that I thought would be steamed but were definitely stir fried. Also OK fresh.  The biggest let down of this was the "mango cheesecake".  I was expecting some kind of mango inside the cheesecake, but, alas, it was just plain old cheesecake with.... get this... "mango puree" on the side. It was a thimble full of mango juice. And fake mango juice at that.  *sigh*  I would eat here again, but I will definitely lower the bar before I do.

Seriously AWESOME.  First time here, and it was GOURMET MEXICAN, just as advertised.  Everything was fresh, spiced in unique and thoughtful ways, and presented very well.  I had the RIBEYE.  If you are a carnivore, please eat this.  And thank me.  Oh my dear wonderful god it was tasty.  I ordered it medium rare and it was PERFECTION.  They really have taken some time and energy to make each dish distinctive.  My friend had the Ensalada with Cilantro y Pollo and it was such a surprising blend of so many different tastes.  The chicken had a GREAT chargrilled flavor and blended with all the other veggies.  We totally got suckered into ordering the sizzling ice cream dessert (I think it's just called apple pie on the menu, but my name is "The Ice Cream SIZZLER".  We watched the table next to us get presented with this hot stone dish with some pastry + ice cream, and then the waiter poured some delicious sauce all over it, and that damn ice cream SIZZLED.  So sweet, but oh-so-tasty, and even the after dinner coffee was really soothing.  I was so utterly satisfied by every aspect of this dining experience, I just hope they keep delivering!

Another cozy breakfast place.  I am a sucker for black coffee and eggs diner type places, so please understand that I actually sort of like that crappy diner taste...  That being said, I've had 2 great experiences here so far.  The service has been a real pleasure.  The servers are friendly and fast and will go out of their way to help with special requests or order mix ups.  The prices aren't bad, and the food is pretty good.  Basic breakfast fare.  I like that there's a jukebox that will play random songs from just about every era (even some 30's and 40's throwbacks).  When I walked in at 6:30am one morning, they were playing old-timey bluegrass.  And the interior design is like the inside of a log cabin.  I love that kind of kitschy-ness so it works for me!

Decent airport food.  I usually am here in the AM, so I do breakfast.  The pork carnitas burrito is awesome (for the airport). Its made to order so you can substitute as you like it. (For me no cheese and sub black beans instead of potatoes)  Also they give A LOT of food (I usually can't quite finish the whole burrito by myself) so you get a bang for your buck (um, FINALLY an airport restaurant that doesn't follow the code of "shitty and overpriced")  Also the coffee has a nice flavor (not the normal burnt black that I actually LOVE), and it comes in one of those taller glass mugs (I would prefer a regular mug, but I guess it makes it look nicer?)  Overall one of the cozier places I've hit up in the airport.

Reverse happy hour.   That's all you need to know!  No really, this is a great place to go later in the evening (like 10:30 or 11) for a drink special or a light appetizer.  I've never been here during normal dinner hours, so I can't speak about the dining experience, but I love hanging out here at night with a friend.

First time there.  It's right up next to the Mekong Market.  The pho was solid (love me some rare beef and brisket), and we also tried the "autumn rolls" instead of the usual spring rolls. It has egg in it, so you know I'm a fan.  Overall, good pho, good price and good service.

I had a pretty good first experience with Frontier. I usually fly USair but someone else booked my flight. I almost always have to gate check my bag because I'm usually the last one on,  but since I volunteered my bag they let me board first. (That's a first for me!) The seats were nice and the service seemed fast (granted it was a smaller plane.ha.) I think I would still choose US just because of what I've heard about the flight time changes. That would mess me up, but no problems this time!

5 stars for the outstanding customer service!  I've found Phillips to be dependable for a solid airport breakfast here in Charlotte and in other airports as well.  But I've never had such amazing service in an airport.  Ever.  I had just gotten off a redeye from Denver and was bleary and foggy and in serious need of a black coffee injection.  I stopped into this Phillips since I've had decent experiences in other airports, and they are very accommodating of my substitution requests (no potatoes, bread, thank you very much).  The food was good, the coffee was black and always kept warm.  Here's the outstanding part:  I tried paying, and i had some issue with my card. It would absolutely not go through, and there was nothing I could do. I didn't have cash or another credit card. Yikes!!!!  The manager came over and just very kindly told me that he would take care of it.  And that I didn't need to pay.  WHAT??!! Amazing!  I got their address so I can send not only the tab, but I will be sending some flowers or gifts, and especially tip my waitress since I jipped her with my not-paying-ness.  I will be their regular whenever I'm in CLT.  Seriously.  At the airport!?  AWESOME.

Yum. Freakin yum. I have been mostly Paleo for about a year or so, and I've all but cut bread out of my diet, but damn these things are tasty. Like how I would make a sandwich at home if I had time and skills. Toasty bread. "steamed meats" I guess is their thing. And oh it is delicious. I've had the Steamer (pastrami and corned beef. yummmmmm....) and the Italian which is dripping goodness.  I love the shelf of hot sauces from around the globe, all rated 1-10 by the heat factor.

Thanks to Stephanie T for clearly pointing out the dinner buffet!  This was super satisfying and they really go one step beyond your usual buffet.  For one, they serve up garlic naan fresh and hot and don't charge extra. Some places will just give the regular naan and charge more for the garlicky goodness.  Two, they serve a piece of fresh tandoori chicken to your table instead of letting it just dry out on the buffet. (And its tangy! Me likes.)  Three, the mango custard dessert is better than average and there is fresh hot chai--all on the buffet. Again, no extra charges!  Oh yeah, and the regular food was pretty tasty. The buffet is laid out by vegetarian or not so if you're not a meat lover then its easy to find and decipher your food.  I had a nice glass of Cabernet which was just fine, no complaints.  All in all, I am satisfied and I like the feel of the whole place.   The owner (?) came around and said hello and checked in and seemed to know many of the diners there (many hugs were going around) . Cool atmosphere. Homey.

First visit - Awesome.  I just walked in to get a feel for the place since the reviews were all over the place.  The front desk staff was great and they worked me in right on the spot.  (50% off brazilian for first time visitors)  My waxer (?) - anyway Kirstie - was also great.  Professional, friendly and thorough. They use powder, some finishing lotion, and Kirstie did catch the little stray hairs with tweezers.  I just moved into the area and this was definitely better than my waxing place back in ATL.   They have lots of great packages if you're a frequent waxer which I will probably go for if the service continues to be like this!  I really appreciated the way they gave me information without trying to sell me anything.  Overall I am looking forward to being a regular.

2nd experience - better than the first.  I am so happy with this place.  I've had 2 great "waxers" (someone help me please, what is the appropriate european term for this?? cuz these gals deserve better)  And the front desk staff rock.  I've been to some places where for some unknown reason the receptionists act like they're doing you some great service by existing and if you expect more, ya know like smiles or courteous greetings then boy are you going to be disappointed.  No such thing here. I mean this may be a stretch but the whole team makes this otherwise traumatic experience kind of... well... fun! (Too much?)  They recommend products without being pushy and I get the feeling that they actually use them so they're not just working you over. They actually like the stuff they're promoting.  I've bought a couple products and they definitely help with the post wax skin care. (No little red bumps or ingrown hairs)  I pay more than I did at my "in-n-out" brazilian place back in atlanta but I find that this wax lasts longer, less irritation, and some genuine care from the staff.  I mean, you're getting hair ripped out, you might as well have some part of it to look forward to. Right?

Solid inexpensive Thai place.  Tasty.  Casual and FAST.  I work right by here, so it's a go-to for a quick lunch or dinner.  I am IN LOVE with the Spicy Eggplant with chicken or pork.  That eggplant literally melts in your mouth.  I SO recommend this dish, even if you're not a huge eggplant fan.  It is a tad on the greasy side, but sometimes you just NEED the grease.  Be careful with the spicy levels.  I tend to like things really hot, but even a 7 was a bit much for me.

Okay, Thai Chili owners.  Please prove me wrong.  I'm very disappointed in Thai Chili management.  I have had okay food and service here, but my friend has had 3 or 4 bad experiences in a row with no effort to remedy their mistakes.  But I like their food, they're close by my office, so I talked her into going with me again, even though she swore she would never go.  I specifically told the waitress to treat my friend like a princess because she has had several bad service experiences here, and she's kind of trying it out again on my request and referral.  My friend ordered "Pad See Iew" with beef.  The waitress read back "Pad See Iew" with beef.  We all heard her say "Pad See Iew" with beef.  And what comes out? (very slowly, and my friend was the last to get hers, btw)  Pad Thai.  And literally the waitress was like "Didn't you say Pad Thai?"  No! And neither did you!  The mistake is not that big of a deal.  She seemed pretty ditzy.  But the complete lack of management of the mistake is just inexcusable.  All she did was just say "Sorry, I thought you said Pad Thai".  Um.....  There's no manager and no owner to take care of these kind of situations? Offer to comp a few free meals?  Give any kind of gesture to make up for their (seriously stupid) mistakes?  My friend had described 3 other instances like this, but I didn't really believe it until I saw it with my own eyes.  The way this was not managed gives me the feeling that the owners don't really care how the restaurant is being run, and that they are not that interested in customer service.  Even though I like the food, I won't be coming back unless I really see some kind of effort to improve their management.  There are lots of other Thai places within a couple mile radius, and I will be patronizing them from now on.

Okay, Thai Chili owners.  Thanks for responding to my yelp complaint. I really hope that the management atmosphere keeps improving.  UPDATE: The owners contacted me and offered to make it right, and I did take them up on it (I mean, I was having spicy eggplant withdrawal!!!), but my friend is still just not ready to take that chance.  I am pretty regular over there when I'm working in Phoenix (less than a block from my office), so I'm glad to know that the management is listening and doesn't just let mistakes (multiple mistakes) go unchecked.  Thanks again, Thai Chili owners for extending your care! It is most appreciated!

This place is just A-OK.  But I give one extra star for being open until 11pm.  I have been saved from fro-yo withdrawal by this extra 1-2 hours of open-time.  The guys are cool even if you walk in at 10:55pm (which I have done at least 3x in one month).  Why do I always crave fro-yo right around 9:30pm???  The fro-yo is not particularly outstanding but it is available, and that makes me happy!

5 stars for EXCELLENT service and salesmanship.  I found The Orchard through a personal referral, which is like gold to me.  I came in just to get my poor little 2007 Macbook hard drive replaced (again).  Thankfully I had it backed up so I wasn't as freaked out as the first time. The guys were very courteous and informative over the phone, and even better in person. I had been thinking about a new computer anyway, but kept putting it off because my Apple tastes weren't in sync with my PC budget. (ha) After discussing my options on the hard drive issue, I browsed the laptops on sale and saw great deals on great machines with lots of upgrade options. It was going to be about $100 bucks or so to do the hard drive, and as we chatted, the salesperson, Jared, also informed me about the possible trade-in value of my Macbook and then he answered all my questions about the laptops on sale. He called his manager about the trade-in value, and by the time we were done, I walked out with a good-as-new Macbook with an upgrade of 8G of RAM, a bigger hard drive, and my data transferred. There's a 1yr warranty, and also future service benefits.  If you don't mind a gently-used machine with very minor cosmetic damage, but a brand-spanking-new interior, please check them out for machines, and definitely for service.  Thank you thank you thank you, Orchard!!! I am your new fan!

OMG this was unbelievably tasty and uber healthy.  Its like a smoothie in a bowl but BETTER.  I tried the Original by the servers recommendation. Good choice! Acai, strawberries, blueberries all mixed up topped with granola and bananas and drizzled with honey. No added ice or sugar. So so tasty and refreshing. Kinda wish I'd ordered the large!

Completely head-over-heels IN LOVE.  Found them thru Yelp and I was not disappointed. In fact, it was 100% what I was looking for.  I wanted a place to sit down and have a nice long catch-up conversation with a friend while possibly eating just a few shared appetizers, or going the whole hog and having dinner.  I arrived early enough (5:30-ish) to catch the happy hour specials, and stayed long enough to have just about everything on the menu. It would probably be wise to have a reservation for the prime time 6-8-ish hours, as the place filled up fast.  We were sat at the couches in the back which were just fine, even to have a meal. The service was PERFECT.  Our waitress came around often and just at the right time, never interrupting and always ready when we needed something.  Started with a charcuterie board (I'm sure I've spelled that wrong) which could be a small meal.  Kept chatting and eventually wanted more food and drink. Had an amazing green salad, and my friend had the duck entree. Eventually we had to satisfy our sweet tooth.  OMG - please eat the peanut butter creme brulee.  It was magical.  I also tried scotch for the first time (they have several choices) and was most pleased.  It was definitely on the expensive side, but for a nice evening of food, drink and talk, I couldn't have been more satisfied!

$1 tacos on Tuesday nights (not sure what time that starts).  The bartender talked them up, and they were actually pretty good.  My friend and I stopped in here for a beer before catching a movie across the street at the AMC 24.  (Why can't they serve alcohol in movie theaters? That would be awesome.)  Several beers on tap, nothing too exciting, but nice for my regular Guinness pull.  I'll come back and hang out longer next time, as there was plenty of outdoor seating with the spray coolers overhead.

So far this has been my go to for all things eggalicious. The food is fresh and tasty and the service is pretty consistent.  I highly recommend the "La Casa Potencia"  which is a protein packed dream. Grilled chicken, egg whites, fresh veggies and beans on the side.  Tortilla too if you're a wheat-eater.  I just moved to Phoenix a few weeks ago, and I have been here at least twice a week.  I should probably order something different next time!!

This is my GO-TO place for a Paleo-style lunch or dinner that gives nice big portions, keeps everything fresh and juicy, and doesn't put much of a dent in the ol' wallet.  Favorite meal:  carnitas salad bowl with all the veggies no dairy and a lil' bit of guac  I don't know if every Chipotle is like this, but every now and then one of the employees will work the dining room and refill drinks or give a little extra service.  That's nice and they are pretty friendly when you walk in the door, too.  Even though they're mostly behind the counter.  Can't lose here!
