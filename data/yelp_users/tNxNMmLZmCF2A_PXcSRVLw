I work right down the street from La Tolteca so many of my co-workers visit here regularly. I finally visited...  FOOD The menu has a great variety and is pretty inexpensive. However, my burrito kinda started to taste funny as I finished it up- almost like cleaning solution--- I didn't get sick so I'm not sure what that taste was.  I like the bakery and the sweets selection and the salsa is pretty good.   OTHER We also use this place to cater meal for our late working employees. The catered food was a lot better than my burrito.    I will give La Tolteca another chance...

Retro setting, organic food, and friendly service.  FOOD Well, it's a diner so you have burgers, fries, grilled cheese, etc to choose from. The burgers have always been cooked as I like them (whatever your preference is...) The fries are organic potatoes, cut daily- sometimes a little on the brown side in appearance but they always taste good.  Grilled cheese is great- not too greasy like some places.  There are sodas and iced tea to drink- both organic.  ENVIRONMENT 8  seats inside and outdoor seating availible. I would recommend eating outside if it is nice- sometimes inside is crowded and everyone can hear everyone else's business.   OTHER Bring cash, no cards accepted. If your service is good- tip them. They are really nice!

Unique setting, great food, fast, fresh carry-out as well.  FOOD I've dined in twice and have had numerous meals to-go from here. The food has always been fresh and delicious. You can tell the ingredients used are freshest.   The burgers are hearty and sandwiches could almost be 2 meals for me- I'm small, though, so I don't eat a lot in one sitting... Nice wine/drink list and yummy desserts too.    ATMOSPHERE The Cafe is a brick home turned restaraunt. Very nice location for brunch or a date night and great for a casual lunch as well. SInce it was once a home, the seats are kind of close to one another- but still a nice setting.  OTHER The Cafe is very accomodating to special diets. They also have accomodated me last-minute (not my fault) for to-go meal for 10+ people, with a smile on their faces.

OK pizzas, bird-attacks during the meal, long wait...  People would tell me I just "have to try Oreganos". So, I finally went. I don't really understand why everyone said it was a "must try" restaurant.  FOOD: The pizza slices are good, but not exception. They were a little on the burnt side but yet, not hot when they were brought to us.   SERVICE: I felt like we had to flag down the server everytime we needed something. Drinks refills took longer than they should have.  There were 2 of us that went for lunch and we were there for over 2 hours. Ridiculous...  AMBIANCE We sat outside and were continually attacked by pigeons as we tried to eat. It was kinda of noisy too because the place was packed... even outside it was loud. (You would think the noise would have kept the pigeons away).

Not going back! Noisy, not relaxing, cramped, poor service  I walk in the door and one of the receptionist's boyfriend was hanging out in the lobby with their dog!! He hung out with the dog in the lobby for a good 10 minutes. Gross! Though I showed up 15 minutes prior to my appointments I was taken back to my treatment  more than 10 minutes late.    Massage: My masseuse spent most of our hour together trying to figure out how to maneuver her chair (nosily) around the massage table. She also wasn't very good at tucking in the blanket around one part of my body while massaging the other. (It shouldn't have been that hard I am a very petite person- I wasn't taking up much of the blanket to begin with.) Noise- The walls of the massage room wall were so thin I had to listen to a really loud customer talk during my entire massage. I could hear every sound in the salon during my massage. Doors slamming, people talking, hairdryers, etc.   Facial: The facial was in the same room as the massage the noise factor was still applicable. She removed my blackheads but almost to the point of hurting me. You're not supposed to pop zits. You'd think an esthetician would know this- it causes scarring.  Haircut: Nothing special. My stylist gave me the same haircut that every other stylist does though I explained to her I wanted something very different.   Overall: Would not go back or refer anyone to Bravo. I wasted time and money at Bravo.

Wonderful staff, great stylists, a little pricey, could have a better floor plan.  I went here with my entire wedding party to have everything done. My sylist even came in early before they opened so she could accomodate us. We were all finished in a timely manner and we all loved the outcome of our hair, nails, etc.   Positives: If you are willing to pay for the service, it's worth it. The staff is very friendly. Even if you go there for the first time it doesn't feel awkward.   Negatives: crowded and noisy when they are busy, can get a cheaper haircut that turns out the same from somewhere else, like AZ Hair Company.   Other: I would recommend making an appointment even though they do walk-ins,

Run away! Pay more and get a decent pedicure somewhere else!  Over the years I have been to dozens of salons for all differents types of pedicures. I've had $5 pedis and $100 pedis. Regals pedicure was by far the worst pedicure I have ever had.   Lack of Service During my pedicure the nail tech hardly looked at me, instead she watched the T.V mounted in the corner. Her maasage was only smearing lotion on my legs. A typical pedicure should last from 45 min-1 hour. This lady had me out of the chair in less than 30 minutes.   Pedicures Shouldn't Harm You During the smoothing of my feet she actually rubbed a hole in my foot- it was bleeding and everything!! She didn't even notice!! Now 10 days later I still can't wear closed toed shoes because of the cut.  $$$ The price I paid for my pedi was almost double what was advertised. It turned out that during my pedi the tech asked me if I wanted her to remove callouses, use sea salt, etc. Each question she asked turned into a $3-5 charge without her mentioning the price addition. Your $20 pedi only includes a short massage and polish- everything else is extra.   One Postive Thing The only thing that turned out nice was the paint job on my toes. The end result looked good-- if you don't notice the hole in the side of my foot.  This is truly a lesson to me about getting what you pay for. If you go cheap you get cheap service. Never again!

My husband took me here to celebrate my 30th birthday and it was fabulous!!  When my hubby booked the reservation he mentioned it was my b-day and they waived our parking fee and sent free wine and cheese to our room-- YUM!   Room:  Our room was comfortable and clean, great bed-- we are really picky about beds because we have a sleep number bed at home. Loved the shower: spacious, beautiful tiling, pretty good water pressure. Coffee and tea are available in-room.   Positives -Beautiful views, especially at night.  - Nice workout room with very high tech equipment, cold towels and fruit. - Special treatment for a special occasion. - Misters around the pool during the day to keep you cool - Poolside ice water coolers for easy access    Downside - The entire pool is a play pool, no deep water. - Hot tubs were too hot to get in and my husband usually wants the hot tub really warm but this would melt your skin off.  Side note: During the summer tons of locals are here with their kids so if you are looking for a romantic getaway go some where pricier-- where parents won't pay just for a day at the pool :) And just a warning I will be bringing my kids here next summer when the rates are cheap :)

Great sandwich, fast service, and a cookie too!    FOOD  I ordered the Dali Sandwich and it was delish! There was plenty of egg salad (and no onions or celery in the salad- that made me happy) piled on my sandwich and the 12 grain bread was moist and fresh.  I had requested no bacon or mayo and they made just how I asked with no complaints.  My coworkers ordered the Chicken Salad and enjoyed it as well- though the lettuce looked a little yellow to me- I like mixed greens usually. But the chicken Salad looked great.   AMBIANCE  A little crowded at lunch time- and at 11:45 there was only one parking spot in the lot. There are regular tables and chairs and an area to sit outside. I also like that they had a special "to go" pick up line. It was very organized.   OTHER  I had a full stomach for $5.00 (I had water to drink). I f you're in the mood for a simple sandwich or you want a monstrous one with sprouts, peppers, and different kinds of cheese- try this place.

Easily one of the Best Mexican Restaurant in the Greater Phoenix Area, especially for the money.  SERVICE Always friendly, fast, and very accomodating. There is not host/hostess in this restaurant. So, servers will seat you although you can seat yourself if you don't mind waiting for your server.  I have been there many times and unless they're quite busy i never wait for a refill on beverages or chips and salsa. They are not always the most thoughtful servers, but always very accomodating to your requests.   FOOD Always hot, fresh, and higher quality than most mom & pop mexican hole-in-the-walls. i have yet to find something i didn't like on the menu. However, i do reccommend any item with steak -- their steak is so favorful. Absolutely excellent!  They do offer several kinds of salsas. They usually bring out a bean salsa and your typical mexican tomato salsa. Both are good, although most of my friends and I find the bean salsa to be superior and more unique than most restaurants in this category. Also, they do make a darn good Horchatta as well.  The value of food for your money is superb! Most items do not cost more than $10. The amount of food you receive is above average, not ridiculously large, but on the more generous side. Plus, as i remember i've never been nickel and dimed for extra sides of sour cream, pico de Gallo, etc. except for maybe cheese and guacamole which is understandable (even then, i didn't pay any crazy extra amount).  AMBIANCE For being a hole-in-the-wall in a small shopping center in not the greatest of areas in Phoenix the decor is simple, mexican, and welcoming. Their restaurant is always clean from what i've seen. Bathrooms are nothing special by any means, but pretty well kept.

Great experience, clean, recommend HTC to for all piercing needs :)  Through the years I have had multiple piercings (belly, eyebrow, ears, etc).  My nose piercing was the first one a got at HTC. Fantastic experience!!  The staff helped me feel comfortable from the moment I walked in the door. They are professional and knowledgable and do their best to help you find the gauge, style, and type of piercing that is right for you.   I had my piercing done in a private room so the whole world wasn't staring at me when I got a needle shoved into my skin... It wwas quick and honestly it didn't hurt too much. Just felt like I had to sneeze when he pushed in the needle.   (All the piercing tools are new and the piercer washes and sterilizes several times through the process. )  Also, I was glad to find out that the piercers are required to maintain current certification in CPR, First Aid, and Bloodborne Pathogen.

Thick pizza, ok service, and urban decor.  FOOD No matter what you order, there will be plenty to go around. We order the thick pizza with an array of toppings. There was a little too much garlic on it for my liking. Because it was so thick, the dough didn't seem cooked all the way through.  It's nice if you want to build your own pizza. They have a large selection of toppings. You can also get pasta, panini, etc.   AMBIANCE The setting reminds you of being in the NYC subway- creative urban decor, setting was a little crowded on a Saturday night. If you have a party of two, request a booth. The table we were sat at was really small and smashed into a corner.   SERVICE Our server seemed a little distracted, though we overheard her say that she had worked there for 2 years- she still seemed somewhat inexperienced while attending to us.

In 2007, I received my first Bachelor's degree from an accredited AZ university (ground campus and few online classes). While working, I wanted to pursue a second Bachelor's degree in another field. I thought going online to Rio to get pre-req classes out of the way would be a good way to save time while employed. Nope, nope, nope...Mind you, I am not an unintelligent individual. I have completed 400-500 level classes at other schools (finishing several classes with over 100%)  I took a couple 100-200 level classes with Rio and my biggest complaint is the disconnect between the study guides and the exams. I would spend hours prepping for the exams, then I would go to the testing center for the exam, open it up on the computer, and feel like it was written based off of something totally different than the study material-- the only consistency between the exam prep material and the exams are the essay portions-- sadly this part of the exam is only worth 100 points (I received 95-100 each time). But that does not compensate for the lower grades on the rest of the exam.   I confronted the administration about the disconnect several times, and I always got the same response "We get lots of complaints like that and we are looking into it."   If you can do online elsewhere, do so!

I am reviewing this location for eyebrow waxing only... a pleasant surprise!  I am very particular about who touches my eyebrows. And I was thrilled with my end results :)   LOCATION :This strip mall salon is hidden from street view (located next to Bashas). Needless to say I was a little worried about getting my eyes waxed at some hole in the wall salon. But in this case I can't judge a book by its cover.    AMBIANCE:  It's just like every other no-name nail salon out there... pedi stations, mirrors, etc. The waxing takes place in the back of the store. Not the most glamorous setting but it was clean and the equipment was well- maintained. I laid on a comfortable padded table with a clean towel under my head. The lady didn't say much (not to stereotype but she didn't speak that much English).  THE WAXING: She was very, very thorough while working on my brows. I didn't give her any specific instructions beside my request that my brows aren't too thin when she's done. The wax was the perfect texture and temperature. She was efficient, fast, yet thorough. She cleaned all leftover wax off and applied lotion to keep any redness down.   My brows look fabulous and with my coupon it was only $7! Here's the website and they have coupons :) I will definitely go back, especially for the price.   http://www.biennails.com/

Healthy food, delicious tea, but crowded on weekends  FOOD I am usually not a fan of hummus- but this was the first place I've gone and liked the hummus. It was delicious! Every dish around us that was brought out to other tables looked delicious. (I only ordered a pita and hummus) The menu had a great mix of lite meals and heavy entrees. Great if you need a snack or a full blown meal.  AMBIANCE The decor is unique- there are paintings (that are for sale) on the walls. The kitchen is open and you can view it from the dining area.  It's noisy and usually busy. There's not a lot of room when you enter the main door. If one or more parties are waiting you may need to step outside to have any room.   OTHER When I asked for an extra pita at the end of the meal I expected to a $2.00 + charge. They only charged us .30 for the pita :) It was great!  Try the Iced Tea- it's delicious too!

Wonderful tea, comfy seating, and great food!  FOOD This was my first fully vegan restaurant experience. It was wonderful!! I always wondered what a BLT without real "B" tastes like. I must say it was the best BLT I've ever had, including those with bacon. I don't know how they did it! The strawberry smooth was also divine.  ENVIRONMENT The ambiance/atmosphere has a very modern, new age feel. The main dining room isn't huge but the seating included  tables and some long couch-like benches- great for my daughter to stretch out on when she was done eating. The front of the restaurant is completely open allowing for an open air atmosphere- very nice!  OTHER Big parties may want to call ahead. And sadly, they are only open unitl 6pm on Sundays...  They were very accomodating to my daughter's peanut allergy and they washed all containers for food prep just for her.  Highly recommended even if you aren't vegan!

The Gelato Spot = Creamy goodness, tons of flavors, and less guilt than Cold Stone or DQ.  GELATO You can sample as much as you want top help you decide which one of the amazing flavors you should get- Blood Orange, Nutella, Kiwi Coconut, Fudge Carmel Brownie, Mint Chip, Amaretto- is your mouth watering yet?  AMBIANCE It has coffee shop/Ice cream palor feel to it. They have regular tables and chair and also very comnfy chairs around a coffee table too.   OTHER They clean their equipment constantly so if you have a peanut allergy (like my daughter does) they will accomodate.

I have a cooking problem- I can't do it. However, I loved coming to Entrees to Go to make our meals. My husband bought a Groupon for this place and we decided to try it out. It was a wonderful experience, and that means a lot coming from me since I am not a fan of cooking.   I love the concept of Entrees to Go. You prepare your meal at this place and bring them home in a baggie.  Meals ready to cook and no mess in my kitchen = awesomeness! Everything you need to know to prepare your food is explained and if you have any questions they are answered immediately.   The only downfall...The price w/o a Groupon is a little pricey. Three full size entrees (each entree serving 4-6) is regularly $80. It's great if you work full-time and don't have time to cook on your own but it's a little high for my pocketbook. However, if money wasn't a factor I would cook every meal at Entrees to Go.   Loved it!

Great services, great location, a bit pricey.  SERVICES If you are willing to pay a little more than your average salon, this place is worth it. The services are divine and they make you feel at home when you visit here. Shampoos feel great, mani/pedis, leave you feeling very relaxed.    I would recommend getting a pedicure on a week night when they aren't busy.. here's why: Pedicures are done in a semi-private room. It they aren't busy you get the room to yourself. If they have other bookings, you share with one other person.   AMBIANCE Aloosions has a very comfortable feels to it. It doesn't feel cramped or crowded at all. It is very open and has homey touches through out the salon... It does have more of a salon feel than a day spa feel to it.   OTHER Sign up on their website to recieve their emails. You will get great discounts!

Great wine selection, VERY light food menu, great staff, and you can bottle your own wine.   WINE Great wine tasting: 5 tastings for $10. They give you a good amount of wine for each tasting, too. Because they bottle their own wines- some of them are not matured yet so they tend to be on the "too sweet "side for me.  The Porta Cocoa is amazing!   FOOD Don't come here looking for a full meal. They have a nice selection of appetizers to go with their wine- cheese plate, crackers, dried fruit, etc.  They also have desserts but not a full menu for meals.  The appetizers go great with the wine but won't fill you up.   AMBIANCE  The beautiful wood floors and wonderful art on the walls help you escape from the bustle and rushing of the city. This place will help you escape from the business of life- especially on a weekday because it's pretty quiet here during that time.   OTHER If you decide to have a party here, you can bottle your own wine! The wine is reasonably priced as well.

Why pay more? You can't beat this place for the price!  This is the only place I go to get spa services! I have been going here for almost 2 years and it's great. I used to go to all the expensive places (i.e hotels and specialty salons) and spend hundreds of dollars for treatments.   I recommend the body treatment and the spa facial especially. They do a great job on eyebrows too.   Positives: price, friendliness, you feel like they take time to help you, they fix anything you don't like, no tipping.   Negatives: sometime haircuts take longer than normal and  If you get a body treatment the service are provided in one large room with curtains dividing clients. Sometimes it's annoying if the person next to you doesn't shut up during their treatment.

Traditional food, nice service, busy on a Sunday  FOOD I had an amazing tuna salad on an english muffin w/ fries. Very filling and great tuna- not soggy like some places. Needed more fries though.   My husband had fluffy pancakes- had some of his and they were yummy.  But he said the eggs and the sausage needed a little help- I'm a vegetarian so I didn't ouch them.  Our daughter had french toast w/ bacon. Bacon appeared to be crispy, unlike some places that serve practically raw bacon. I was happy to see that my daughter was eating sufficiently cooked bacon.  AMBIANCE The decor is very simple. Laminate floors, and few pictures/posters on the wall. They could do more with the place and since it's in Scottsdale I would recommend that. Don't come here looking for a quiet place to have a relaxing meal- at least not on a Sunday.   SERVICE Since it was busy, we waited about 15-20 minutes to get a table but the host on duty made sure to let us know several times that he hadn't forgotten about us. Once seated, our server was quick to acknowledge us and took our order immediately since she knew we had plenty of time to peruse the menu while waiting. We did have to wait a while for our food but the waitress explained to us that the kitchen was backed up because they were so busy. Overall, we were there a little over an hour- klind of a long time just for breakfast.  OVERALL I want to come back and during a weekday and try another item from the lunch menu. It was satisfactory for a simple down home meal.

This place was a wannabe, lower quality, Chipotle restaurant.  Lower quality, meats NOT made to order, too pricey for the quality.  I ordered the fish tacos and when they went to put the fish inside the tacos I noticed that the food was NOT made to order. My fish was in a warming container- as was all the meat. Ew! I was worried that my fish was hours old and I'd get food poisoning.   $$$ I thought the price was too high for the quality. If I'm going to spend $15 and only drink water the food needs to be better quality.    The positive: they had several kinds of unique salsa (mango salsa was good).   Skip it-- go to Chipolte, Baja Fresh or Rubios.

Most amazing massages ever!  I have had dozens of massages over the years at resorts, spas, etc and none of them compare to the work that Mariya does!! She takes time to listen to your needs and gives you an incredible experience.   I have had a 1 hr. Swedish and a 1 hr. lymphatic drainage massage. Both massages were tailored to my needs and I left feeling wonderful. The lymphatic drainage massage cleared up my congestion/sinuses and  totally detoxed my entire body :)  Mariya has the gift of massage...awesome!

One of the best pedicures that i've experienced in a loooong time! Over the years I've had so many pedis-- everything from the uuber expensive ones from resort hotels and the cheap-o ones around the corner. I would dare say that the pedicure from Pro Nails by Andy could rival even the best of my past pedis.   I was greeted and in a pedi chair quickly and on time (sometimes a rare happening at certain places). I got the Euro Pedi-- hot towels, sugar scrub and massage. I feel like I got 2 massages-- the sugar scrub massage lasted as long as the lotion massage and was incredible! When massages were done I got hot towels and a hot stone leg rub down, The polish went on and I added a design. I recieved this adorable tri-color design on both big toes complete with a wisp of glitter-- I felt a little guilty that the design only cost $5-- worth more for sure.   No need to hunt for another nail place--if you live in Glendale or Peoria, come here :)
