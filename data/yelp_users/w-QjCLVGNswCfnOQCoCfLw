I don't understand why Lenny's doesn't have a 5 star rating . This location is a classic , always leave satisfied & full , one of the best burger joints in Phoenix in my opinion. Came here the other night for dinner with my family & tried their new chili cheese fries with pastrami (pretty sure it was like a secret menu item that people would create themselves) first of all their pastrami is to die for and then their chili cheese fries and are gift from the fry gods and putting it together should get a Nobel peace price

Went in on a slow night , it was our first time , nothing really appealed to me except the awkward tables, service wasn't really too pleasant, I had found this place off google maps decided to try it out because I have a love for tacos. I ordered a carnitas taco , chicken taco , and two tacos de cabeza , it honestly all tasted as if it was seasoned with salt , no flavored except what came off there handmade corn tortillas , I just wasn't satisfied at all, it might have been there style of cooking that I'm not into but I know I've had better tacos elsewhere .

I don't understand what the big hype is about, long drive thru lines , bumper stickers , t shirts , souvenir cups? I tried this place for the first time Friday night , girls at the counter are rude or ignorant or both , I got the 8 chicken strip combo with fries , the rest of my family got #2's which I think was the two planks and fried shrimp , everything was cold , while ordering I watched food go straight from a box that was frozen straight into the frier , everything was just bland , unless you drenched it with Pete's sauce , blech .

I always come here , for happy hour , especially on Thursdays for karaoke , majority of which I have good service , this past Thursday 4/4/14 we had a new server that we've never had before Noe R. , excellent service , and not just with us , I noticed how he was hit the rest of his section . Definitely will be asking for his section in the future . We also usually get the trio sampler appetizer , wings , mozz sticks & wonton tacos & out of all the other times we've gotten this , this time was the best , service , drinks , food and music was on point !

Where do I start ! It was my first time coming here , my boyfriend and daughter came in on a Sunday morning & there was about a 20-30 min wait , I've always heard good things about this restaurant so we decided to stay , thank goodness we did , writing this review just makes me hungry all over again ! I do need to stop buy and try dinner . For breakfast I got biscuits and gravy with bacon and it came with hash browns & I also got orange juice which was freshly squeezed (yum)

Ive been here 3 times already , and every time has been packed , which is a good sign. Ikind of dis like having to squeeze through to get my salsa and garnishes, maybe its time to get a bigger spot? haha . I'm a huge fan of Tacos de Cabeza , alot of places have too much fat and are really greasy , but here its ON POINT . I havent tried any of the plates they have on the menu , usually stick to tacos . My daughter gets a cheese Quesadilla on a corn tortilla , and my hubby almost gets one of each taco on the menu ha . the green salsa the have there is the best ive had since my mother in law & the guacamole sauce (i think thats what it is) is also great . On my last Visit i had done take out , ordered 4 tacos de cabeza , i was craving it like crazy, took less than 10 mins, took me another 10 to get home , peeled back the foil and realized that I got Carne Asada, i was so sad or fat that i got dissapointed and ate my food unhappy , but that was partially my fault for not checking my order . i'll be back soon when im craving tacos !

Came here looking to buy a new laptop , I swear I'm here every other weekend buying something . I don't think I've ever been helped with any purchases , bought our xbox one here , printer , and bose speaker , tonight we came for a laptop , we we're in the laptop area for about 20 mins without being acknowledged, then finally a girl came over to ask if we were still doing fine. Kind of irritated by that time , 15 mins more and they started turning off the lights , not caring that we were still in there .

Blackened chicken tacos & carnitas tacos are my extreme favorite . Add cabbage & green sauce to both & its a date .

The leafy green produce here is crap . The meats & chicken have lots of fat tucked underneath and very pricey .

Brought my 4 year old daughter here for the first time and I was impressed , compared to another dentist visit at another dentist office I came in expecting the worst , and got nothing but the best . Rose took care of my daughter today , did her X-rays & cleaning , my daughter was extremely comfortable & happy with Rose . I highly highly recommend the Cute Smiles 4 kids !

Wednesday night I had a HUGE craving for pizza and was extremely tired of getting Pizza Hut , I wanted something more like Real pizza would taste like. After spending hours on yelp & google maps looking for a close enough pizza place I finally decided on Doughboys and I enjoyed everything of it . Customer service was average , but the pizza and the price can't be beat . I got the Special with and XL 1 topping pizza with 20 wings ( I got the buffalo ) for around $25 with tax , done within about 15 mins from ordering over the phone , sitting in the car I just couldn't wait , I had a wing & I was in heaven , so meaty , and far from dry and skinny like most other pizza places . As for the pizza I did wait to get home to eat , definitely saved the best for last , pepperoni and cheese pizza heaven

Service , there is literally more than enough people working to serve each person in each party , yet service slacks , a lot , not sure if this Buffalo Wild Wings or a place for employees just to hang out , chat and text , I wish I got paid for that . Customer service is everything . Any ways , food is good , great place to drink , cool happy hour from beer to appetizers , lots of TVs , perfect for football season

Came here for the first time ever , it was a Sunday night , because the wait at Olive Garden was way too long , and I'm glad that happened because I would have never thought to stop here & I was not disappointed at all. It looked seemed like a slow night , parking lot was not too packed and there was no wait at all. When we walked in , I noticed that there wasn't a host up there , figured she was sitting others , but we were immediately greeted by another server that had finished taking a tables order, which I really appreciate, there after the host took us to our table, and about a minuet or two passed where out server Elizabeth B. Introduced herself, she was amazing , I can stress how much excellent service my family and I revived from her out of all the other restaurants I've been to or any business , she gave the best customer service. Anyways I ordered the prime rib , medium well with mashed potatoes and the garden salad , which all came out delicious , my 3 years old daughter got the hot dog and fries , which she ate the majority of it so I'm assuming she enjoyed it too, my daughter enjoyed the all the attention she was getting from our server , she was nice enough to put her order in a few minuets before ours so my daughter got her food first , which Is a smart server technique in my opinion , everything was just perfect that Sunday night, even the price , for it being my first time , I will definitely be returning more often '

I drive pass this place almost every single day , always see it full & finally decided to pull over to give it a try . A small hole in the wall restaurant, has one of the best tacos I've ever had in my life , keep in mind I'm a huge taco enthusiast , this location is moving to a small strip mall on Bethany home road & grand & extremely excited to see how the new location will look inside . The menu was written on poster board , but none the less simple & clear . I had my self two tacos de pastor al trompo, and two de longaniza, (tacos come in pairs) , I got my daughter two chicken tacos , and my boyfriend got a burrito de pastor. Tacos came garnished with cilantro, onion , and grilled onions & sliced chile toreados, with an slice of lime & an excellent green tomatillo salsa. Also the pastor tacos came garnishes with a few slivers or pineapple, the way real al pastor should be served . I'll definitely be back for more !

First time coming to this restaurant , so I was kind of nervous when i didn't see other customers inside , but I'm glad we still have it a try , portions are huge & prices are just right . My daughter got just one carne Asada taco and that thing was packed with meat , I ordered a carnitas taco and chicken tostada , I didn't thing that I'd get full off one taco , but I did and it was delicious , I saved the tostada for later and was still delicious . And on top of that ordered a carne Asada quesadilla which was also Amazing , I'm not too much of a carne Asada fan because usually most places are bland and dry but the carne Asada here was to die for . Can't wait to go back and try the other things on the menu , thank goodness this is close to home .

Good concept, almost like uptown alley , except service was absolutely horrible , the worst , Rachael from the Front desk was rude , I've never had such horrible customer service in my life , never have met anyone as rude as Rachael . It was only 11pm and they just closed out our tabs even though we weren't done ordering , we had just started a new bowling game . Only good thing about this place was the pizza other than that , hopefully management is reading this , get it together on the customer service . Definitely will not be returning .

Update review 3/10/16  Unfortunately came again , because I had family come from out of state and really wanted to try it out after I advised not to , same issues with horrible service . Ordered drinks as soon as we got to our lane , few mins Ordered their amazing pizza , didn't see our server for a while , pizza came out , still no drinks . Service really slacks here , all around , from checking in at the front desk , getting shoes for bowling , lane service to laser tag , to redeeming prizes , just bad bad bad .
