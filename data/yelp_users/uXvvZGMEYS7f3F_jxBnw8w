Great atmosphere with lives bands after 8pm.  Huge wine list with great appetizers.  I recommend the cheese plate and the potato,fig and Spanish bacon flat bread.

Liked the out of ordinary location and design of the restaurant.  The bar had some good libations with good Gin drinks infused with lavender.  The bacon and dates with radish is a good appetizer.  The buffalo chips with hot sauce and blue cheese are really executed well.  Entrees were ok, more of an app and drinks place.

Probably the best sushi in Vegas, maybe best I've ever had.  The steals are like butter and the lobster was cooked perfect with the fried rice.   Ahi tuna and hamachi, off the hook, literally.  Very fresh.  The dessert was good and the service was amazing. Prince is the best server we have ever had, will ask for him every time, he made the night a Vegas experience to remember.

Very real very authentic Mexican food.  The tacos are really good, the nachos were tasty and large portion.  The burritos come with beans and rice only and pico,so I would say to skip the carbs and go tacos loco get 3-5 as they are small but delicious.

Ok so, here is what not to do in a restaurant.  They ran out of my First and second choice entrees. No big deal but did cramp my style and hunger, but that didn't throw me off as much as.... I saw a sever take a Mop and water bucket upstairs to clean at the end of the night, then 3 minutes later the ceiling above us where the server was moping upstairs" starting leaking Bleach water on our table and the people next to us.  On the table in the martinis, then the all star manager on duty said "oh no that's not Mop water that a pitcher that fell over," when it Cleary smelled like bleach to everyone around us.  The manager should have paid for  their dinner and apologized instead of lying

Ok so update, although I had a bad experience, the mangers have reached out to apologize and offer to buy dinner for me and my guest which is nice to see.   They are obviously working at it so good for them.

Wow, what an amazing place. I have been to 4 different Mastros and I think this one has the best ambiance.  The lobster is always on point and the bone in rib eye and bone in filet are the best steaks ever, 400 degree plate? no prob just be a man a touch it.  Butter cake, was very good and as always service is generally outstanding.

Great sushi place, probably the best in Scottsdale.   Great ambiance and design, good service and great manager.  The W is pretty much always on point with its restaurant partners.   Try the diced Chilies and hamachi. Amazing.

Ok, so great food without the typical steak house menu.  The pate was good, the hamachi was above average, the steak was good as well.  The popovers where the best part of the place, good try for a not so ordinary steak house.

Great place for drinks and dinner. One of my favorite places in Scottsdale.    Good ambiance, good mix of people and food.  The pork belly lettuce cups are the best thing they serve and the Jidori chicken is really good.   Reservations one week out, same owner as zinc and the house.

What a great place, good food, the service staff is on point and the quality of food is very very good.  007 Martini (Vespor) was a throw back that makes crack seem like wack...delicious.

Probably my favorite Fox concept, great atmosphere and good take on new American foods.    The fried chicken is amazing, Ma' The meatloaf is good, MAC burger is awesome and the mussels were tasty.  The cheese and meat plate is great starter, bit pricy but good.  Plus good looking staff.

Jack talk Thai? Jack talk Thai, real well.  Great Thai, in the higher priced to portion sized but worth it.  Drinks are no joke, a double is $24, so idk if that's the best place to drink it up, but the food is the best Thai I've had in AZ.  ROTI,Pad Thai, Garlic Shrimp all really good, Plus probably the most beautiful hostess I've ever seen.  Enjoy

So no rolls here, stop asking.   This is a straight up really sushi, 8 tables and small sushi bar place.  Owner called to confirm reservations, which was nice.  Bottle water for everyone, great touch.  Real,Real sushi you may turn Japanese after.  I'm a fan and appreciate them not selling out to the average sushi roll typical place.

Had the house with some good friends and enjoyed the the patio seating.  Tried 6 appetizers and 4 entrees like we were cool, took food home as the was only 4 of us.  The duck buns, the fried rice were really good.  The owner was very cool knew our friends bought us a round on much not needed tequila as we we're already tipsy, but nice night cap...I think...don't really remember much. After that.

Great New Age Burger Joint. It's a Bar, Meets a wide range of burger options, from turkey to Grass fed. Not your typical burger place and well priced for quality.  The Salted Carmel  shake was the best I've had, so good show old chap.  Lol enjoy.

Really good New Age Italian, with a small Cheese and meat market attached for EVO and Balsamic heaven lovers.   Pizza is good, an attempt at the regulated Rome 12 inch round.   The beef lasagna is good and not commercial tasting as most tend to be when bought at a restaurant.  Good wine selection, decent price and a surprisingly great dirty martini.  Good for dates or an Italian fix, a bit pricy as you do 3-4 courses, but worth it.

The Best BBQ in Arizona, maybe the best in the country.  The brisket is amazing and the Turkey is surprisingly moist and not what you would think. They care about what they are doing and only do quality BBQ.
