I've gone to Juan's on and off over the past ten years. I return, because I forget that the last time I went I told myself to not go again.  I agree with a previous rater, Juan's food is so-so and acceptable.  Generally speaking, the service might be called good service ("...except for the owner who is...").  Be prepared to wait and no matter what, the wait to get your food is always slow no matter how empty or packed--ESPECIALLY if you order take out and ask how long before pick up will be ready. On a recent occasion, I placed a take out order and asked the owner on the phone how long it would take and he told me 20 min.  I waited 15 min before leaving the house and it took 5 min to get there. When I arrived and asked for my order, I was courteously advised by the cashier that it was "not yet finished." I watched the kitchen staff as they initiated preparing my order from the beginning. As I observed this process I asked the clerk why she said my order was already in process and she responded that "...it was."  When I had first inquired about my order (having been told it was 'nearly ready') I asked whether chips had been included and the owner advised me that I would have had to have ordered chip and paid for them.  While I waited AT the restaurant for my order for 20 min (that is in addition to the 20 min I waited before leaving my home) I would have thought management would have been courteous enough to offer me chips while I waited. They did not. So, instead of apologizing for the inconvenience of waiting on them or making my wait pleasant, I left a very dissatisfied customer.  When I got home with my order, I had to endure my companion's complaints that the Albondigas was skimpy on the meatballs. Same said companion used to frequent Juan's extensively several years ago when he worked closer. He now challenges me each time I indicate intent to go there and refreshes my memory on past disappointments.  The burritos are indeed well made and are pretty much the highlight of the menu. The tosdadas shell are not freshly fried (you can see them sitting on a shelf above the grill), yet, my tostada was still soft. The prices are cheap $7-8 combos. Again, fair if you are in the area but you can find better Mexican elsewhere, even nearby..

Here for the farmers market, but am appalled at the upheaval due to the management's remodeling/destruction of long standing architecture. (This city has been oblivious to its' cannibalism of structural art.)

Open 7 days/week from 6A-10:30P. Parking can be a problem depending on the day/time. Also depending on day/time it can be full of families/children. During the summer it is hot inside. I really like the large selection of front load machines, from single loads to four load sizes. There is a money changer and two televisions. Plenty of carts and folding tables. I've been going here on/off for over ten years.

I was at The Henry and noticed the gentleman next to me was wearing some clever frames. After inquiring I secured the information that he acquired his stylish lens at Ray's. Plus, he was highly complementary of the treatment/service. My next review will be of my own purchase.

The architecture inside and out is beautiful.  The music leader, Carl, is genuine and talented. The worship music (in the 2nd service) is 'contemporary' and is more easily chanted than sung. The minister has a close relationship with the congregation and ministers real life concerns.  They recently removed the bench seating (BOOO), that had been so very interesting, the benches had been carpeted with the same material as the floor, it took me a visit or two to become accustomed to it but now it is gone. The church is very community oriented, for many many years they offered a "Dickens Holiday" to the public--a marvelous winter wonder, that is now gone (donated to a church in Louisiana, post Katrina). The facility has a pipe organ, which I have never heard used.

I've written other reviews in the past and I have contributed MANY pics (one of a frozen fountain went viral in my FB purview). I've been a patron since they opened their doors. It took them a while, and I remember driving past every day to work, south on 7th, on my way to my position of public service (as a dedicated state employee) watching that sign (opening soon) for months and months wondering WHEN they would finally open.  Anyway, I noticed a couple of less than favorable reviews in Yelp and though I dont challenge their accuracy, and though there are MANY excellent 5 star reviews I feel compelled to reiterate some observations.  The owner (and his Board of Director(s)) rescued a dilapidated gas station and invested money to redeem and try to retain the integrity of the neighborhood feel of the original building.  The bathrooms have some interesting design, by a local. (I had started a list of PHX bathrooms of note on Foursquare and then got distracted -- the former Florist and the former/current Christopher's had some interesting ones.)  The bakers in the past AND present have/do all create delightful confections (though I continue to petition for more savory).  The interior ambiance is sufficient. And has gone through some changes over time to meet the whims of customers and ownership.  The landscape is maintained by a local who is also a patron.  The cute little fireplace is stoked by a local, whenever he chooses to come by, and feels like doing it.  This is a dog friendly place and I love all the dogs that frequent it.  The owner...he cares about what he does and he is quite engaged in his neighborhood and his community. This coffee shop, this project, is something he CHOOSES to do. He is supported by his Board of Director(s) because of the service this small business contributes to others.  So, remember that there are NO automatons here. What is here is a choice, despite health, wealth, hassle, obstruction or disappointments.  Thank you to the staff, management, operations, ownership (and Board of Directorship) for keeping on--keeping on.

The atmosphere is kitchzy but every time I have stopped in, it appears clean. The food has always been fresh and of a high standard of quality. Their perpetual 'special' of fish tacos is served with an unexpected and lovely flourish of shredded salad items. However, only four stars because of the pricing. So, I recommend getting a combination plate instead of a burrito. Pricing for a business is based on many things, overhead (rent, utilities), labor costs, supplies (staples, food items), etc and only the owner/management knows their needs to meet their ends so I can't say whether something is overpriced. However, I have found that the price for their burritos far exceeds the price for value of their meals. You pay for convenience at this establishment.

The food is great and pretty consistent, there are many standards they've had on the menu for years. The owners are very community oriented. The happy hour and seasonal holiday events are terrific. There is patio seating (for the, ick, smokers). They often have live music and a game night.

Casual atmosphere; 2 pork chops*2eggs*biscuit and gravy*fried potatoes, plus a side pancake: g8 hot sauce & SOS from scratch, fried potatoes are tasty.  Coffee was barely tolerable with non-dairy creamer. Gr8 pancake, but served with 'country crock' vegetable oil spread.

I have been patronizing this establishment since they opened their doors and I have not ever been disappointed. I never hesitated to bring my previous car, a MB SLK 230. The auto mechanism is well maintained and I have no fear for my alignment. The no streak rinse, leaves NO streaks and the dryer upon exit is pretty thorough.

I have been patronizing Lola's since they were on Central, the first time (then Lux, now pane Bianca). Oh, I have waxed (poetic?) frequently, on how much I bemoan the loss of Lola's Tapas...    So Lola's closed Tapas and reopened as a coffee shop, and it was good. Then they closed that location (now known as 'The Wrap?') and moved back to Central in the small shopping center housing Twirl and Hulu's (into the location where Tessa's Teas? or a combination antique shop and tea house previously resided for many years). And, it was good. Until, they left. (Two other incarnation coffee shops followed in Lola's wake but it now sits unoccupied.)  This current Lola's location is in a sweet spot next to Pita Jungle and nestled snug in the bustling art district, supported by hipsters and professionals serving the state's capitol (minutes away) and just north of the downtown business district, also adjacent to one of Phoenix's Points of Pride Japanese Gardens and just a nudge farther north, Encanto Park. I do, btw, very much miss the earlier occupant, an Italian deli with a genuine and warm owner. Their wares were SO delectable, especially the rice balls (cant think of what they were called).  Okay, so, this coffee shop sits on Roosevelt and has a large window front facing the very busy street. There is a table with room for five where one can watch the world walk by. The ambiance is rustic and cozy (like Tapas was, oh I so miss it). There is outdoor seating both on the sidewalk next to the street and in back on the patio--dog friendly(!!!). Lots of seating indoors.  They have a skilled baker/cook (quiches, frittatas, tortilla espanolas, etc.). They used to have a STANDARD Rosemary shortbread, yum. I don't visit often anymore but the last many times I've been, the shortbread was not present, sigh.  Patrons include students studying, professionals working, parent(s) with child/ren in tow, or...the likes of me, hanging out.  Back to the location. Lola's shares Roosevelt with Red Hut Coffee (their iced coffee IS good), Tammie Coe's Bakery (excellent baked goods, acceptable coffee), Songbird Coffee (has a similar 'feel' with it's own street side window/seating, great coffee, cool shared space, select baked goods, fun weekend waffles), very nearby is the acclaimed Jobot--respected by peer coffee shop owners along with Cartel, and Fair Trade.  Lola's Coffee bar, on Roosevelt--and, it is good (grin).

You want (to break your fast) bfast? They will add an egg to ANYthing you ask, noon or (late) night.  The service is very 'user friendly' and not over attentive, great laid back neighborhood ambiance and menu and a long comfortable barfront. A bit pricey, about $1-2 more than I am most comfortable paying.  Their burgers...oh my! Layers upon layers of savory flavor. I got the Nogales burger with an egg. It arrived stacked high, a creation of art.  Downside? I always order my red meat medium rare. My burger was definitely medium. Now, there is such a thing as "carry over cooking," something that happens  when flesh continues to cook beyond the time it is directly exposed to heat--something I learned from James Weston Haynes, the MOST ILLUSTRIOUS instructor extraordinaire of food science cooking at Glendale Community College (TAKE HIS CLASS IF YOU CAN!!!). I believe this is what happened to my burger.  My server was advised of my disappointment (the situation was unmistakable). He made the noble offer (replacement).  I declined as I am wont when, 1) I am disappointed, 2) in a time crunch, or 3) oh, many other reasons...  He then "presented" me with a specialty of the house, a plate of mini donuts. This act was gracious, thoughtful, and strategic--because it recovered his score. I cannot say that I enjoyed them much because at the time I was not inclined to devour sugar (see my profile). Nonetheless, the gesture served him well.  I would be a regular if it was my "hood.

This is an easy to miss/pass up local...which I stopped to check out a few years ago and am so glad I did. It is locally owned and operated. They have a standard menu and a rotated special.  The most obvious thing they sport is the vast selection of boutique sodas.  The food is fresh, ex, the fish is hand battered--in their own kitchen. The buns are very good, solid enough to hold up under all the marvelous stuff they put in their burger/sandwiches but soft with a nice bite/texture.  Back to the sodas...I think that it would be a very fun thing for a group of friends to gather and have a soda tasting event. It could event be a MeetUp. I do not want to even start listing the selection--just visit and take a look for yourself.  Finally, I have always been served by the same pleasant gentleman all the years I've been going there. Consistency, is something I value.

The Songbird Coffee & Tea House (SCTH) sits directly on Roosevelt Street sharing such distinction with two other coffee shops namely, Tammie Coe Cakes and Lola's Coffee (just off, Red Hut Coffee, JoBot Coffee, and Fair Trade Cafe). SCTH shares a space with with an art gallery and leather works manufacturing space. SCTH has a large window front facing the road (like Lola's) where you can perch and ponder passing traffic and gaze at the Phx downtown skyline, to include the Valley Ho. (Matt's Big Breakfast's FORMER location had a similar such lovely view...no longer.) SCTH carries baked goods from a favorite local bakery and each time I visit, other patrons make a point of extolling the degree to which they enjoy their own purchase.  Today I had a Cortado (see the posted pic). My first Cortado was served by Sam, of the (now known as Demi Coffee) Mud Dauber Coffee Shop on 16th St at The Hive. I now head out towards the downtown Phoenix farmers market.

When a customer is asked their name and they respond deliberately by stating, 'they will write it' CLEARLY they do NOT want it spoken out-loud. When the clerk DOES read the written name out-loud, it can be assumed they did it deliberately--violating the customers attempt at privacy from the public.  TWO stars for lack of concern over customer' privacy/security.

This place is always, always packed.  I will not ever take the drive-through because it is forever. When the customer line is long they will/do put additional persons at the registers. The burgers are served freshly-made and the flourishes are very fresh. There is a member of my party who refers to this place as his 'church' (silly boy). It has always appeared clean to me, even the water closets.

Their beer is standard named after TPAB's (former) mega salesman, Fretzy. He was a delight and I miss his energy. Nonetheless, there are still plenty of good folks here who share an equal level of service commitment and community concern.

What?!!! Darn, I hate being pressured. Okay, a review. First, somehow, 'my' bartender always recognizes me AND know what I want to order; next, I love love love the clean white tiles for the splash back of the taps; next again, I love the chalkboard of beers on tap; they have a dog friendly OUTdoors patio; the bar has PLENTY of room; the (small) growlers are cute (see the pic); the NAME of the place; the door knob (know knows the significance? It has NOTHING to do with angels); the beautiful cross stich the Fates featured in the hall leading to the water closet; okay, I much prefer incognito, but did I mention my server? Thomas; the food? Every plate that leaves the kitchen/is served to the person sitting near me looks delectable.   Okay--done

I have been going to the Polish Festival every year since they held it ar their old church in Sunnyslope. OMG! I dont k ow whether it's because it reminds me og my gma's cooking or what but that food is mighty delicious. In the same respect, to get excellent polish sausage and real sauerkraut head to (Sunnyslope OR) the downtown Phx or Roadrunner's farmers markets for a taste of 'home.' They have stuffed cabbage, pirogues, and many other polish baked goods/sweets.  Finally, like (the homeland) their establishment is owned/operated by a husband/wife team.  Try their wares.

Update on The Mud Dauber/LoFi. It was/purchased and currently under new management. Bobby is the primary barrista and artist in residence, you will see his talent displayed.  John now works for Leashed Dogs and I encourage avid patrons to pursue his services because he is excellent in customer satisfaction endeavors. (Excellent conversation)  Sam has probably already opened his recent gig on Grand. I rarely venture down there 'cause it requires lots of pedestrian effort. But I'm certain it has its own je ne sais quoi. (Excellent conversation--pulling no punches)  Randy is still the the Roaster for Xanadu Coffee. He staffs LoWi Mesa and you can find a recent pic of him in my last check- in there. (What a sweet spirit)  So, current management has already made CHANGES (I am not a big fan of the blue wall but am in the minority). They have plans for additional 'improvements/changes.' Though I miss previous management/staff, the new folks hold their own, intellectual conversation-wise, very well. They use ONLY organic dairy and that fact sets the tone for their philosophy on all else.  Life is not static, nor should it be. I am glad that I am (still) flexible enough to roll with the change(s).  PLEASE step in and lodge a request that they KEEP the name Mud Dauber.

I have only been here on my own, so I sit at the bar. I have always, always found excellent conversation with who ever else was also there. (They have always touted the virtues of NMB.) I also always get some variation of the flight. Sometimes I order food, but usually I do not. The atmosphere is excellent and casual. There is a small patio on the street. The owner(s) are actively involved--at least one is always around.

I do not ever care to have the piped music/noise this loud. Not only does it make it nigh upon impossible for conversation, but it can be disorienting for those with hearing dysfunctions, not to mention oppressive for some PTSD survivors. Finally, a persistent pounding base can be unconducive to proper digestion. One star down for noise.  That said, the (non-noise) ambiance is terrific, as is the food. I eat here often enough and tried numerous items off the menu, to say the food is great.  It has a lovely patio and the 'bar' is indoor/outdoor (*pet and kid friendly).  A very big draw is the Sat morn farmers market adjacent to the restaurant.  I think the prices are $1-2 higher than the average 'family' restaurant, but remember it is about the ingredients.

I arrived at a perfect time, with no line I had a choice of seating, and my server got to me promptly. I immediately noticed the noise and volume of the 'music.' After reviewing over other posts I conclude the volume is deliberate, to deter 'lingering.' It worked on me, my ears are still ringing from the din.  They lost one star for that. Otherwise, the service as I said (Alex), was eggzellent. The menu intriguing, and my meal special. Oh, and the coffee was better than average for a non-coffee shop.  I'll be back

As I stated in my earlier tip, they have beignets AND chicory coffee. The beignets are prepared (fried) fresh and you can request to have chicory coffee, served in either single or double service in a French press (how appropriate). I have been to New Orleans several times (I had many outstanding reviews on my experiences proclaimed on Yelp, but Yelp staff elected to delete most of my BEST reviews--out of state and intl travel) and this experience was mildly reminiscent of Cafe du Monde. Only mildly so, because there is no outdoor seating available. But the service was charming and so was the serving setting. Step in the door and feel yourself propelled to another place/another time.

Haven't I reviewed this location before?  Okay, they open early and stay open fairly late (need to cram study for an upcoming exam?) They have AMPLE patio seating (with free wifi) and, they are the only SBs I know with a private 'conference room.' There is plenty of parking available, plus there is a Sprouts nearby along with my decade long favorite public laundromat.  Local parents must feel this is a 'safe place' because I have noticed some 'regulars' kids hanging out, as though awaiting their 'swap/pick-up.' (THAT is a good thing.)  They are pet friendly (most SBs are) and I have seen some service animals that are regulars.  All the staff is great, pleasant and courteous, there are a few who are my favorites.  Well, I think I hit the high points.

Great happy hour, great beer selection on tap and bottle, you can also buy from stock and ask them to serve it. Comments about price are viable so go during happy hour if that is a concern. The servers know their tap(s) and happily give tastes, OR just get a flight--MY favorite move. Lots of bar front (I really don't know what to call it) room and often good conversation. I haven't ever felt rushed.

Five stars for: considerate service.   I have a food sensitivity, to corn. The level of sensitivity has been increasing over the years. At first it exhibited itself in the corn starch of egg drop soup. But as time has passed I find more and more corn associated food items result in producing in me the symptoms of a diabetic attack: heart palpitations, sweats, nausea, some cramps and general malaise.  I arrived at Blanco for happy hour and ordered the guac (nutritious and tasty) and cheese dips. I asked my server and later the deliverer whether there were any alternatives to the corn chips, explaining my allergy. I was advised there was not, so I requested some flour tortillas to be served with my dip and they were.  As I was tearing off pieces of my flour tortilla and spreading it with guac, contentedly munching on my repast...Shane, one of my bartenders, noticed and approached asking in a concerned tone whether my chips had not yet been delivered. I reassured him that I had declined them and explained why.  Shane and Nikki are the bartenders who attended me that evening. They are both satisfactorily attentive and courteous. Additionally, Shane...well he is pleasant to look at.  Shane returned a few moments later to discourse again. He commented that he too has a corn allergy. He asked whether my allergy was severe enough to cause problems eating something fried in the same grease as corn. It is not (yet) and I responded as such.  A few minutes later, I was served a bowl of fried flour tortilla chips.

Bogo McMuffin after completing a questionnaire online.  I like the ambiance, it feels like mid-century style--clean, neat, comfortable and not industrialized.  The manager was at the door when I arrived and he both greeted me pleasantly and held the door for me.  My cashier greeted me pleasantly, answered my questions, took my order (including the special requests), and wished me a good day.  My order was accurate and tasted good. Besides, it was VALUE priced (bogo).  My experience (for fast food/MickyDs) was very much 5 star.

Parking is clearly posted--yet, if you go early (around 7:30A) you can see employees (what? they are dressed in scrubs and/or wearing govt ID badges) parking next to you and/or getting out of cars in the reserved patient & visitor parking lot walking by when there is NO employee parking ANYwhere around you.  There is a parking garage being built, finally--though it was funded a decade ago.

MOVED!!! I guess change is to be expected after Green Haus sold and left. I speak all the time of Phoenix cannibalizing itself and here is yet another instance. A 'once historic' building with irreplaceable artwork is demolished and in its stead (is being built) another monstrosity.  Songbird moved south--down the street, into a house. They now have patio space and a yard. Parking is available in the back. They do still have window 'bar' view but not anything like the former location.  (This feels a bit like JoBot whereas the other location had the ilk of Lola's.)  The owner(s) are very Social Media aware and respond to concerns.  My Cortado is fine. Ambiance is fine. Service (as before) is charming.

They opened their doors two months ago. They are open at 5:30A! That is important if 1) you work and 2) you want to beat the heat. There are only a few other places nearby with those hours.  They are close to the Coronado Neighborhood and have a long drive-thru area (meaning you will not be stuck out in the street to be in line). They take phone-in orders. There is parking behind the building and on the street.  They are user friendly, meaning if they don't know how to make what you order they will look it up and try. I ordered my standard, a Cortado. It was a good try, for my barrista's first time. He offered and served it with sparkling water (and an improvised cup).  I also got a cold brew to go--tasty, they serve it up with crushed ice. For 'outsiders' who don't understand the importance of a cold brew (I can't believe the term Toddy has been legally trademarked) this is the desert and we have been under excessive heat warnings all week. (Iced coffee is refreshing and satisfying.)  They have breakfast sandwiches, I ordered a Swiss Piggy, and enjoyed it. There was a generous amount of thinly sliced juicy ham and melted Swiss cheese.   Bottom line: service, attitude, ambiance and cleanliness gets five stars. (Especially nice is that ownership/management is present.)
