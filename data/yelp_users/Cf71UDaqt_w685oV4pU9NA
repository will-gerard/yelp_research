Impossible to park. (Small lot and a helluva walk from non-permit streets. No meters: it's Phoenix.)  Decent food and drinks.  Service can be OK...or towards the rude/don't care side. Depends on who is serving. A very young staff will often yield this result.  Too many employees behind the main counter not doing anything. Not a manager-heavy environment.  ONE employee at the coffee bar making espresso-based drinks; a counter which is usually backlogged.  Too much crap/displays littering the register/order area. Confusing layout, no signage and no line ropes to help form orderly queues.  Seating area tables and chairs (in the big room with the grills) often not properly wiped down; crumby.  An expensive-ish modern American/gastro-pizza pub-ish menu.  Dessert case = a step above Fry's/store-bought.  Mostly a scene. Not about a quality dining experience.  People go here mainly to say "Let's go to LGO!" I'm convinced if it wasn't for the snappy acronym, business would drop 39%.  Super-fancy building exterior and interior decorating though!  No thanks.

I've been going here regularly for more than a year. Prices are fair and the service and cleanliness of my clothes have been solid. I really couldn't ask for a better location, price and experience.  After moving to AZ I found this place on Yelp. I think the signage outside the business says "$1.50 cleaners" or something like that. I don't think it matches up to the Yelp business name, although the street address/phone number does, which is how I found it. Aside from being confusing to first find the place, I immediately started to have a good experience here...one I did find it.  Recently, one of my items was damaged during cleaning. The owner apologized for the inconvenience and refunded the money I paid for my item. Now oftentimes, when a business owner or manager has to be held accountable for a mistake, they can be combative, rude, or incredulous. But this process at Park Ave Cleaners was hassle-free, easy and darn-near pleasant. This business makes my life easier by cleaning my clothes for a fair price, and owning up to a mistake made (one mistake after about 14 months of going here); and that makes me a loyal customer who further trusts this business.  Solid work and honorable. Rare.

My wife is Japanese and -- after visiting the few that exist -- this is the only Japanese market she'll go to in Metro Phoenix.  New Tokyo Food Market needs a new name probably (wife thinks calling a Japanese market "New Tokyo" is lame sauce), but inside... it's the real deal. Good selection and friendly staff.  Careful though before making the trip: closed on Tues and Weds.

No no NO NO! I've been here enough times over the past couple of years to refute the hype, players! Yes this place is tragically hip and over-crowded like a b. But so whats?  Coffee and tea: good, like most specialty places that serve it (Cartel, Echo, Urban Beans, JoBot, etc etc etc). But let's talk about the REALITIES of a trip to (not)Lux.  There are many parking spaces that are usually taken. My guess is more than 70% of the crowd here are students who spend all day working over a cup of coffee and maybe a sssscccccooooonnnneeee. The "Order Here" counter is placed right along the entrance, so when lines back up, they are backing up into a seating area. God help you if that mommy with her two toddlers are seated at an entrance-area table. Good luck getting past that, boss.  The employees here are beyond obnoxious. Gave 'em multiple chances to be cool. They ain't. The baked goods are all pretty much blah/dry/not good. On our first visit to (not)Lux, we sampled much of the pastry menu to-go, because we had heard good things. But much like Cartel, Lux is all hype and not comfort, goodness or fun. It's pain. Pain to find parking. Pain to wait in the interminable line. Pain to deal with the 24-year-old baristas and register jockeys. Pain to find a place to sit. AAARRRGGGHHH!!!  If you're young and down to study and stare, this place is for you. If you aren't 18-25 and wearing flannel, jean shorts, Converse All-Stars, hipster glasses (prescription or otherwise), really wanna live in Portland, have iPod earbuds soldered into your head.............move along, because there's nothing to see here.

I've been to most of the Oregano's in town, over the years, since the beginning when they opened in the 90s. I'm going to review the Gilbert location, because I think it offers the best food, service and parking. Downside: more families (i.e. screaming kids) than let's say the Scottsdale/Tempe/Phoenix locations.  But I tell ya what, when I'm out in the country visiting relatives, I enjoy a stop at Gilbert Oregano's. It's what ALL Oregano's used to be. Consistent, with the best pizza in town and GREAT service. Sad to say, but the service has dropped off precipitously at the Camelback/Phoenix location, and is hit-or-miss at the Scottsdale/Shea location. Maybe since Gilbert is a more family-friendly atmosphere, the servers in the area are more....friendly. I dunno.  Oregano's has always had the best pizza in town, I think. Yeah yeah I'm a food snob too and I appreciate the "real-ish" Italian styles of the Bianco chefy pizzas. But to me, that is more of a fancy bread dish than a real slice of pizza. Pizza should be heavy, with a lot of sauce, cheese and fresh copious toppings. The meatballs are home-made on an Oregano's pizza. Respect for that. But I never understand their red "jalapenos". I think they call it "jalapenos" but really they're just assorted hot peppers. Still taste good; just confusing.  New York has thin crust, Chicago has deep dish, Arizona has Oregano's. It's the signature pizza in the state, from Flag to Tucson. Can I live without their sexual innuendo-heavy advertising? Do I think it's childish and not really funny at all? Well, just because they have lame marketing doesn't mean they don't do a good job of presentation at the ACTUAL restaurants. All are impeccably decorated (for the style they're going for) and all locations look the same, which is fine since it's a good look. ALMOST too much crap on the walls a la TGI Friday's or Chotchkies from "Office Space".  Love their huge parking lot next door. When parking is a breeze, I don't mind a longer wait for a table, as you will often find here. When service is top-notch, I don't mind a longer wait for a table. I think once, it was just-OK at Gilbert Oregano's, but more often than not it's great.  The pasta dishes and sandwiches are frequently tasty and desirable. Good meats, sauces and cheeses. However, the salads have always been a train wreck. Sorry, Charles, but you CAN'T serve iceberg lettuce salads anymore with RAW ONION in the year 2014.  The gross salads and long waits take Oregano's from 5 to 4-stars. But if you go at the right time and know what to order (the PIZZA!), this place is a state gem. Plain and simple.

go here ALL the time for lunch. very consistent. have tried the pizza, salads, pasta and sandwiches.  healthier than a typical fox restaurants place. good portion sizes, good service/efficient staff. why 4, not 5 stars? it's a pricey menu for a strip mall place, which is fine...but when i pay $12 for the salmon and kale salad, it should really have more kale (it's a 50/50 kale/lettuce mix) and more salmon (they give i'd say half a filet). but look, for the area (lots of malls and offices), this is a good mon-fri option for quick and healthy-ish food.  they could do a better job wiping crumbs off the table and chairs however. the bussers are efficient with the dishes, but not thorough enough with the clean, i.e. wipin' down them CRUMBS. i'm wearing nice clothes friend, don't punk me out.  solid lunch spot.

I do love to rip Sam Fox places, because I think his approach to restauranting is "MAKE DA MONEY, WHO CARES BOUT DA FOOD!"...usually. But I have to say, Zinburger at the Biltmore is deserving of its 4-star Yelp rating; which is to say it's a pretty solid place for a quick bite or maybe even a good meal. Been here a few times and the first visit was less-than-stellar, with an unprofessional waitress, cold fries and in-general blah feeling about my time and $40 for two lunch.  However, as of late, it seems the Zin is looking to Win. Had a very nice dinner with a friend here recently and the service was pretty good, the water-refill-girls were on-point, and the food was actually good.......and tasted fresh. Had a salad and I kid you not, the ingredients had the texture and taste of farmer's market quality.  Had their burgers in the past, and pretty decent. On-par with Delux down the street I would say. Fries...meh, not Zinburger's strong suit. But DAMN, hoss, it's an S Fox joint so you KNOW the wine/liquor list be KICKIN! Booze. It's how this chain makes its $$$.  If you've been to the Biltmore you know parking is a breeze. The grounds are clean, and the location is central. It's almost comical how bad restaurants can exist in such a class environment. But Blanco next store is gra-oss; and the "Asian Fusion" place that **used to be** in the Blanco space was hideous. Whatevs, anyway Ziburger is a solid corner lunch and dinner spot. Tables are adequately spaced apart and the noise level, while healthy, is not obnoxious...impressive considering there is a sizable bar in the center of the space.  Zinburger. Pretty OK. For a Fox spot, that's a victory.

Um, yeah...this place is just gross. Cheap-o decor & tables and chairs like what you'd find at the erstwhile Pizzeria Uno's chain (think dusty fake plants, balsa wood unstable chairs that can barely hold a high school student, etc). Greasy/not good/not fresh Pizza Hut-ish pizza. Salads straight out of the bag-style: iceberg lettuce and bagged shaved carrots/purple cabbage, Wishbone from-the-bottle dressing. (Making fresh salad dressing is incredibly cheap and easy, but alas GRIMY-ALDI's, your cooks can't even do that.)  If you want ANYTHING healthy or clean on the lunch menu, forget it...doesn't exist.   Parking a challenge because this slop shop is in the uber-popular Kierland area. Finding it a challenge, since signage and location are hidden.   Service on the meh side: Not bad. Not good.  To re-cap: sh*tty food, bad location, bad parking and 50/50 service. AND it's pretty expensive, for what you get.  NO!

The reviews of PB at the T&C Center look pretty mixed. Which I understand, since I myself have had mixed experiences here over the past year or so. Been here about 10 times total: happy hour side, fine dining side and take out.  THE GOOD- -Good to great ingredients used for their dishes. Obviously this place is most famous for its pizza. And I agree, it is frequently tasty. At times delicious...at other times just good...sometimes just-OK. It depends: did they burn the crust? Did they ration the cheese/sauce/toppings properly? If all is done well here, it's quite good. Not THE BEST...but nonetheless very delish.  -Homemade pastas; love it!  -Really like the decor in the fine dining room. (Can live without the bumpkins who chow on the fine dining side in cargo shorts and poopy sandals, though.) The happy hour side is a little cramped, but that's fine...it's what you'd get in the city... or Milan... or anywhere crowded.   -The bussers: honestly I think the bussers here are sometimes better than the servers. They are on top of water & bread re-fills; and dirty plate takeaways. Very efficient.  -Parking: plenty on all sides of the T&C Center, chief.  THE MEH- -The menu is small and some of the items offered are less-than-inspired. Frequently the salads are lazy. Like, they are **halfway** to being complete salads. STOP SERVING mixed greens + olives + parmesan and calling it a "salad". Maybe this passes for something in Torino...but in !!AMURICA!!, we demand more ingredients, paisan!  THE NOT-SO-GOOD- Some of the servers are GREAT. Some of the servers are just Cute But Don't Know A Lot About Food. We had such a gal on our last visit, which was a good meal. But when you don't know what you're serving, it causes problems. For example, Cutie Gal recommended the "key lime pie" for dessert, saying it's one of the best items on the dessert menu. NOT. First of all, the "pie" was actually a "tart", which is MUCH different. Plus, it was 97% citrus and 3% sugar, i.e. not suitable to eat and certainly not a dessert. We sent it back. The menu here isn't that big - I'd want the servers to at least be familiar with it.  In all, a flawed restaurant, yes. But usually good service, nice atmosphere and quality dishes. Through trial-and-error, you'll learn the better items on the menu and better times to visit. A little pricey, but a solid, good experience on most nights.

On the expensive side? ($5 for two scoops) Yes. Worth it? Yes. Frost Gelato...when it first appeared at my local Biltmorium...I wasn't amazed and excited as if a chocolate factory or Suns practice court was introduced. By that I mean, a gelato stand isn't very exciting. But I tell you what...after experiencing Frost several times over the past few months, I gotta say, it's a quality experience.  The staff is trained extremely well and customer service is top flight, dog. They even add the Italian-ish touch of saying "Buona sera" when you enter the shop (at night at least). Nice touch. Reminds me of Fatburger; how the employees sing "FATBURGER" when you order a...well, Fatburger. Simple, yes. But little things like that add to the experience. Sue me, I like the details. And I like feeling as if the store is run by people who want to be there and care about what they're doing.  Is this true gelato? I honestly can't tell. It pretty much tastes like ice cream to me, and it tastes like GOOD ice cream, so no complaints as to what exactly this frozen treat really is. In our area, The Gelato Spot next to Hava Java at 32nd and Camelback used to be the place to go. But really, over the past couple years, the service and quality at Gelato Spot has been slippin and slidin to the point we won't even go there anymore.  So along comes Frost in our neighborhood...with great service, delicious "gelice cream", interesting flavors and an always changing menu (last time we tried "toasted marshmallow" and "hazelnut chocolate"), easy peasy parking all around the store, nice outdoor seating that is always clean and wiped-down. ***AND the staff comes around with samples and water cups. BA-ZOOM that's good stuff!***  Brother, there is no contest...for frozen dessert in our neighborhood, Frost is where we will be spending our hard-earned cash.
