I enjoy that this is cheap entertainment to go for a date or to bring the kids. The schedule they have has a nice variety for the young ,old, and holiday times. They occasionally have some special for admission, skate rental, slice of pizza, and a beverage on some of the social shopping sites which is an awesome deal! The birthday staff is very helpful in assisting of the setup for a birthday

Ordered the larger gyro with their own in house made pita. The gyro was hot but I am not a fan of the tzatziki sauce being on the top and lettuce in my gyro. I liked the option for the side could be fries, salad or rice. The rice was flavorful and not too mushy which I have seen other Mediterranean places done with it. The price was reasonable for the meal. Their combo gyro meat meal is a better deal with pita, rice, and salad which I would recommend if you are really hungry.

They have one of those Coca-Cola machines now for a wide selection of beverages. Service is friendly and timely bringing out your food. Still recommend the plates if you are really hungry. Two of their plates can feed my family of 3 no problem. I enjoy the rice more than the fries here too.

Came here on a Monday night and place was deserted but the crew in the back was hustling and bustling like it was lunch hour. The cashier Geovani was extremely helpful and polite which you don't see in a teenager this day. I asked him to explain to me what animal style was and he explained it so well to a first timer. Our food was freshly made and tasty but is a bit salty.

Horrible horrible pharmacy service. Took over 30 minutes to fill a 5 and 7 day prescription by the lady behind the counter. The lady then gave a hard time even after the manger said it was OK to use the Cvs rewards points. Word to the wise I know it's not a easy job to fill prescriptions but if you are dealing with customers take a lesson on how to do some customer service.

I frequent the bell and dysart locations and  this was the first time it was "eh". The Bigfoot chicken fried steak and eggs are always large and more than enough. The gravy this time seemed watery and the toast was half burnt and half bread. The other meal of a bacon and cheese stuffed burger looked awesome but we had to return because it was requested with no onion. The replacement was nothing more than a regular burger with bacon and cheese. The bear claws which are usually nice and hot was cold and was missing its butter, and some bites felt like I was chewing dough. It was busy on a Friday night and the place seemed understaffed. After wards when most of the dinner rush was over our waitress barely made any rounds to check up on us and did not get one single refill for our soda and tea. They were nice to remove my date's burger from the bill. Because of our frequent dine ins and our bear rewards card the bill came to 40 cents. If you go to this place and want good service you will have to wait that weekend morning for about 45 minutes when the star employees are working.

I'm not a big fan of thin crust pizza but for this place I would recommend this place for is fresh toppings like the mozzarella and traditional sauces.  We came here for a birthday celebration because my SO signed up for their email list and you get a free large one topping pizza for your birthday.  There was some miscommunication with our server and received the pizza with a different sauce which we were fine with but the server and the manger were insistent on getting it taken care of.  The atmosphere is nice with it being nicer with the outdoor seating. The only complaint we really had was it was cold inside with the indoor seating

This is the fourth hawaiian barbecue place I been to is by far the worst. No teriyaki sauce and katsu sauce which are a given of any Hawaiian barbecue place! Was given soy sauce/glowing red over processed sweet and sour sauce with my food instead. Macaroni in the salad was over cooked and mushy with some type of seasoning that looked like pepper. It was also runny using a low quality mayo and missing the sprinkles of carrot shavings that I'm so used to in a good Hawaiian macaroni salad. The barbecue chicken was dry and could not taste any of the marinade it was supposed to be cooked in. The bed of vegetables was old dry cabbage resembling the fake grass you see in an easter basket. This menu was confused if it should have been hawaiian barbecue or ghetto chinese food of south phoenix. The elderly Asian couple was very friendly and service was quick which should be expected being the only customer in there. The place was clean compared to the next closest one in Avondale. Location is among a lot of other fast food places and can easily be overlooked. I might give this place a second chance the next time I am that far west again and am have a craving for something hawaiian.

We received an email promo for a valentines special for two bowls and dessert for $24.95. This coupon is very misleading since a dinner bowl is already 9.99 each and the dessert is 4.95! We came during the dinner rush which was   packed and busy. Our waitress, "Kelly" gave such poor service in general. The first was getting our drinks after one of our bowls were already made. In getting a refill for us she pretty much dropped the drink onto the table and was gone in a flash. She gave the tab when my date was still in the middle of eating and had to add "I'm in no rush to take this" and once again left in a flash. When she came back to collect the tab I mentioned she forgot the dessert with the promo. Before I could say anything else about which dessert we wanted she was gone already in a flash. She brought back a dessert that we did not want or order. My date asked if we get the option picking the dessert which "Kelly" responded this is the usual dessert. She apologized saying that she should have asked us and offered to get us whatever we wanted.  At this point I was livid and I said very little. We ate our dessert which to our surprise was very tasty. Our bowls were cooked promptly and we do enjoy the variety of meats , vegetables, and carb options. This is my 2nd or 3rd time at this location and thoroughly enjoy the mongolian bbq experience. The service with all these young waiters really needs to step up a notch or two. I will definitely go there in the future to see if  anything changes with the service.

Neon sign displaying Boba caught my eye when I pulled up. I ordered three donuts which were nice and fresh. They have the usual variety of Boba flavors but decided to try the strawberry mango and I hate strawberry flavor. The cold drink is nice for a summer day and blended smoothly. Highly recommend if you never heard of Boba and have an open mind. Go support the local business and and enjoy a great donut.

We waited for over 20 minutes for a simple gyro and steak shwarma combo with fries. There was also 5 other groups waiting for their food also just as long. The staff seemed more concerned about filling some to-go orders from a couple of customers who came in afterwards and left before us before we even received our food. The meat on my gyro was warm but was not seared crispy. The tzatziki was bland, little onions/tomato, and the pita bread was falling apart. The chicken shwarma was dry but had some flavor. Greek fries were good but was thrown off by the serving bowl it came in. I swear they stole the bowls  from Ghenghis Grill.

So we decided to use our groupon for this fairly new place which had a pretty nice decor. Unfortunately that was the only nice thing about this place. A crew of three was working as the waiting staff. Two guys and a young lady. The two men waited every table in the restaurant except ours before during and after we dined. The one young lady who did her best to wait on us gave no refills on water, forgot the iced coffee halfway through our meal, no garnishments for the pho, no plates with the appetizer, and brought a wrong dish out. We felt bad for our waitress and she was apologetic for her errors. She clearly was helping her coworkers from what we observed but neither would assist her. My bowl of pho was large and tasted ok. it was no different from what my mother usually makes. The tempura calamari was bland, greasy, and you could tell it was from a frozen food section. The salad served beside it was soggy which made the calamari soggy too. The best part of it was the dipping sauce served with it. The place was packed with Asians which seemed to get preferential treatment of prompt and friendly service from the staff and the owner. Another kicker is that I'm half Asian and understand the whole culture behind it but don't look a lick of it. This is not the first time I have gotten such service in an Asian owned eatery. Typical sign of "We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone" should also say if you don't look Caucasian or Asian. If you dont know the difference between a Chinese buffet and Vietnamese food then you might like this place but for me if I want my quality food I will just go to my moms place for dinner.

Very tidy shop and separate options of frozen yogurt and smoothies/boba. The lady(owner) up front was very helpful to explain what boba is and the variety of flavors they have.   There is also the option I blended(smoothie) boba or in regular drink with ice boba. Great drink to have of you love smoothies and tapioca foods.

2nd time here and noticed they got rid of the multiple options for yogurt and now have something called snow fluff in fruit flavors and can fruit for toppings. The owner explained it's not as sweet as yogurt so it might appeal to adults with a not so sweet tooth. They did not have samples yet but look forward to the it soon. Still great and friendly service like my last time here.

3rd or fourth time here they now have the flavored snow fluff. The owner Louise is always friendly and informative every time we come here. Enjoyed the variety of toppings they have especially for the new snow fluff. They now sell a variety of locally baked macaroons on the weekend. And occasionally the really hard to find green tea kit kats. Sometimes they run out of boba because they make fresh batches. If they run out try one of the puddings instead. It's still great in your smoothie.

Since it's now warming up there are several options for something cool and sweet. Froyo , smoothies and if you are feeling adventurous you can get boba, snow fluff, slushes, (macaroons on the weekend) and milk tea. And you are feeling super bold you can try their house special. It's an interesting combination involving mango pudding, grassy jelly, boba and various smoothie flavor. Their slushes are rainbow colorful. If you are not familiar with Asian foods I suggest keeping an open mind and after a couple of visits you will find yourself a favorite drink or dessert. Don't hesitate to ask them what they would recommend also being a first timer.

I was thrown back at first since this is technically not an indoor location. They have a variety of flavors which I was told changes daily. They gave us the suggestion to combine different flavors to make like peanut butter and jelly. The employees are very friendly and helpful especially if it's your first time there. There is plenty of outdoor seating and shade if you would like to stay and enjoy your custard/ice concoction.
