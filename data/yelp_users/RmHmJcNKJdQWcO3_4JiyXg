I have been here 5 times (which is 4 times too many) with my wife and kids and have been thoroughly disappointed EVERY time. There has not been a time where I've ordered something and they either didn't have it, or it was horrible.  How this place remains open as part of the chain is a mystery to me. At least the service is half decent, unlike the food they serve.

Excellent food. Prompt service. If you ask for tea, it's not your typical black leaf. It's a green tea fusion that is awesome! The Gramma Salad is terrific: light and spicy. Definitely coming back for more.
