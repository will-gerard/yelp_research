The staff are very friendly and they are great with kids.  They seem to really care and there is no sales pressure like at many other vision centers to buy your glasses there.  But, if you want to buy them there, they seem to have a great selection!

Let me preface this review by saying I have been coming here for a while and the crepes are pretty delicious which is why they are even getting 2 stars.  Service has never been fabulous but not worth complaining about until it went out-of-bounds bad today. Today, a friend and I sat and waited literally 30 minutes before anyone would even bring us water.  This was after my friend had to get up and ask someone at the counter to please come serve us.  Even after that, there was an uncomfortable time lapse before we even got the water!  Then, when the waitress finally came over for our order, my friend politely informed her how long we had waited to even be acknowledged and we were only rewarded with intense attitude/denial and no apology!  One apology if she hadn't seen us or felt overwhelmed would have gone a long way - I get it, but nothing.  We watched her serve all of the other tables food (most of which had arrived after us) before we even had some water!  It was so bad that I started to wonder if the waitress could possibly have something personally against us that I was completely unaware of but that's crazy, right?? So, no validation, no apology, no comp on the bill, no vindication, (except perhaps this review) just a fear that there was waitress spit in my crepe or water...  Don't waste your time here.

Delicious!!!  Best burger I have had in  a very long time!  I had the grass fed beef with sharp cheddar, lettuce, tomato, jalapeños (which were fresh not canned) and thousand island!  I can't wait to go back and have this burger again! Has good selection for kids and great service too!

We come here often and the service is consistently great!  Front of house staff go out of their way to make us feel special each time we come.  The Pomtini is always masterfully created and delicious without being too sweet.  I also highly recommend the Singapore style noodles.  Our kids have some minor special requests that are handled without issue each time.  They have a lot of great rolls - the hot n messy is delicious!  Always a great experience!

We thought we'd try a different place since the reviews were so good.  Unfortunately, all of our drinks came out wrong.  My Cosmo was all syrup.  The manager tried to make it right and got me a new one which was okay so I ordered a 2nd which came out again as all syrup.  My husband did like his French onion soup but my chorizo tacos smelled like dog food so I couldn't get past that.  My son couldn't eat his spaghetti either - I don't even know how you can mess up spaghetti?  The staff all seem very young and inexperienced too.   The menu looked good but we were very disappointed.

I trusted the reviews and they did not lie.    It's a nice small clean and quick eat-in or take-out place.  Don't expect silverware (just plastic) but the service was very friendly and fast.  I tried the jalapeño curry as I had never seen this on a Thai menu before....delicious with the perfect amount of spice to make my eyes water at medium.  Food is very fresh tasting, especially the large variety of veggies in my order.  Also, each entree comes with a small lettuce/cabbage/carrot salad with tasty peanut dressing - yum, perfect way to cool off the spice if it gets too intense.
