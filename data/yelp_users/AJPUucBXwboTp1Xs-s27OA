My favorite pizza place in Phoenix, and maybe anywhere.  I've been here several times and never been disappointed.  Plus, they offer a free economics lesson on handling high demand and low supply.  You can either raise the price, or ration the goods.  Prices are reasonable here, but you have to wait.  But the waiting can be pleasant at the bar next door, with a comfortable seat on the porch, a glass of wine and some olives to nibble on.  Really, this is all about the pizza, and primarily about the crust, thin, charred, with just a little chew.

I thought, silly name, can't be serious barbecue, but this is good!  Meats are slow smoked, and arrive hot, smoky and juicy with a choice of sides and hot or mild sauce.  For a starter we had some Q-rolls, kind of a BBQ brisket taquito, with chipotle sauce.  Good start.  Beef ribs and pork ribs were tender and easily pulled off the bone.  Brisket and pulled pork were as tender as could be, with a nice pink smoke ring, evidence of slow smoking.  Excellent Mac and cheese and pecan cole slaw.  Beer is plentiful and cold, service quick and attentive, and (bonus) a check in discount for Yelpers when we visited.  This is now on my list for future visits to Phoenix.

This is where the Tequila sunrise was invented, and it was recommended by the staff.  How could I refuse?  It was excellent.

My standard hotel when I travel to Phoenix, and not staying in Scottsdale.  Hotel is clean, service is prompt and friendly, and they have pretty good food and beverage service.  Nice common areas to socialize and relax too.

Great service, comfortable rooms and public spaces, and beautiful grounds make this hotel worth a visit.  The restaurants and bars on the property make it easy to stay right here, but the central location makes it easy to explore the city.  I can't wait to come back.

We took a tour of old Scottsdale.  Fun!  Riding the segways was terrific and the narrative about the town was very entertaining.  You can cover a lot of territory and have fun with a group.  Riding the segways was easy and you get ample instruction and practice before heading out.  It's very intuitive.    I discovered some new Scottsdale restaurants to try while cruising by too!

I started looking for barbecue in Las Vegas and had already bookmarked a few, but nothing looked like what I had in mind.  Then I stumbled on Rollin Smoke on Yelp and thought, this could be it.  Now the name Rollin Smoke has a completely different connotation if you're not thinking about smoked meat, but let's not go there.  Let's go to the 'cue.  What to get?  I read about smoked meatloaf, and the pictures look good, but hey, it's meatloaf.  You don't judge a barbecue place by the meatloaf.  You want brisket and you want ribs.  I was particularly interested in beef ribs, and they have them on the smoker here every day.  How about some pork ribs?  They have a rib platter with baby backs, spare ribs and a beef rib.  Add another beef rib for $6.  Sounds good, but too much for today.  The beef rib was just what I was looking for.  Thick and meaty, dark with smoke on the outside, and juicy and fork tender inside.  Just pull gently and it releases from the bone with a puff of steam and meat juices rolling down to the plate.  The meat is seasoned, but not overdone.  There's some rub and some smoke flavor, but it's not dominant.  You can really taste the meat.  Barbecue sauce is offered, but with meat this good, who needs it?  Spareribs were also terrific, again partly because they are nice and thick.  They have good texture and are juicy and moist, with good smoke flavor and seasoning.  Baby backs were a little disappointing, still tender, but a little drier, and at least on this day, didn't stack up to the flavor of the spareribs and beef.    There are two dining rooms inside and a few tables outside.  The store is just a few blocks off the strip, just on the other side of I-15.  Parking can be tough, but come between the lunch hour and the dinner hour and there's no trouble.  Who doesn't like linner?  Staff was friendly and helpful, joking and laughing, and made a point to come around to all the tables to check on everyone to see how they liked their barbecue.   There are plenty of sides, and I had the corn fritters.  Folks rave about them.  They're good.   They're fried nuggets of batter encapsulating some sweet corn kernels, but I was here for the ribs, and was not disappointed.  I'll be back again for the brisket and some burnt ends.

Alaska takes good care of me, and I return the favor by doing most of my flying with them.  After a few years together, we kind of understand each other.  They have plenty of flights to Vegas so I have slots of options.  Service is good, in coach or for the high rollers up front.    Terminal 3 is a big improvement over the old terminal.  I can often get an upgrade to first class between SEA and LAS which is nice.  Luck be a lady tonight.

TSA pre check here only gets you the opportunity to stand in a slightly shorter line, and leave your shoes on.  Liquids out, laptops out.  Doesn't save time but it's usually not busy here.  That gets two stars.

I have to agree with John B and Gayl B who wrote favorable reviews of Cornish Pasty.  I'm no expert on the authenticity of the food but I can vouch for its deliciousness.    I ordered a lamb with mint pasty, despite the fact that I'm more of a lamb with rosemary, garlic and lemon kind of guy.  The crust was flaky, crunchy and delicious.  To my surprise, the filling was large chunks of slow cooked meat with root vegetables.  I half expected ground lamb and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of ingredients.    This place has a nice atmosphere, a large beverage selection and lots of indoor and outdoor seating.  It's the kind of place where you could spend a few hours, enjoy an inexpensive, but quality meal and toss back a pint or 3.  Just have Uber take you home.

THIS is some good barbecue!  It's not the location, in an industrial part of Phoenix.  It's not the building, a small, non-descript single story brick place.  It's the meat, slow smoked over wood coals, until it reaches smoky, juicy perfection.    People have noticed.  I got there for lunch just before they opened at 11, and the parking lot was already full, doors closed, with a line outside the door.  I stood in line and smelled the barbecue for a good 40 minutes (on a Wednesday).  With that aroma in the air, I just couldn't leave, but I sure wouldn't want to see that line on a Saturday!  The owner was awesome, sharing a taste of smoked sausage and brisket with me as I got closer.  Brisket it is!  I paired it with a pork rib, beans and jalapeño grits.  Usually the sides at most barbecue joints aren't worth talking about, but these were excellent.  Beans were meaty with a little barbecue thrown in.  Normally you'd expect cornbread, rather than grits, but jalapeño cheddar grits were enticing, and darn good.  The pork ribs are Spareribs, not baby backs.  There was a little seasoning, and a long slow smoke which left the meat soft and juicy, and just ready to come off the bone with a little tug.  The star of the show, however, was the brisket.  You can get it fatty or lean.  I tried both, and they were excellent.  The brisket is seasoned with salt and pepper that's not overpowering, and a great smoke flavor.  Neither the smoke or the seasoning are too strong, so you can really taste the meat.    Three flavors of barbecue sauce are available, but I don't think you need any.  Just savor the meat, smoke and seasoning.  Fantastic.  This was a great find in Phoenix, the kind of place I'd expect to find in Austin, Texas.  It's been discovered, so there's a wait, but don't let that scare you.  If you like barbecue, it's worth the effort.

I came in because of the many positive Yelp reviews, and because I like the name.  Asian fusion, however, is a style that I'm not always a fan of.  It's often more like Asian confusion when the mashups don't go quite right, or you see the same old Asian chicken salad with fried wontons.  Buddha Belly is more Confucian than confusion, as there is something wise and interesting in their offerings.  Fried shrimp po' boy with Szechuan sauce and slaw, on a soft baguette is a good example.  It mixes a classic sandwich, with just a slight Asian twist.  Chips with furikake are just different enough to be interesting.  Char siu pork sandwich makes sense.  Dragon fries with some chili oil?  Okay.  Short rib red curry flatbread also sounds great.  I'm not sure about the Asian falafel, but next time I'll definitely want to try the Thai clam chowder and maybe the Pho dip sandwich.   I got a little nervous when I walked in on a Tuesday night and I was the only person in the place.  The service was friendly and as you might expect fast, but I hope they get some people in there or Buddha belly might be belly up.    Love the Jones soda fountain with orange cream, green apple, and true cola flavors.  All that's missing is a vodka dispenser so you can do your own mashup with the drinks.

So disappointed after reading a lot of Yelp reviews raving about the BBQ here.  When I read about beef ribs using words like Flintstone and dinosaur, or brontosaurus, it gets my attention.  So, where to go on my next trip to Scottsdale?  Easy choice.    Tuesday night, just after 7 pm.  The main dining rush is over and folks are just starting to empty their tables.  I got a menu and an IPA promptly, and tried the chicken wings.  They were fall off the bone tender, but sometimes that's too far gone.  Some were overcooked or held at higher temps too long where they got dried out.  No worries, I've got a cold beer and I'm moving on to the beef ribs.  Simple.  3 bones and slaw.  No mas.  What I got was disappointing to say the least. Two ribs had virtually no meat at all.  What meat they had was burned, dry and shriveled back from the bone into a dry black ball at the base.  Not appetizing or good BBQ.  My server was great and offered to replace them.  Soon the manager arrives to say no can do.  Those pathetic bones must have been the very last they had, but the kitchen still sent them out.  Want anything else?  Nope.  He took the ribs off the bill which was fine.  They handled the problem appropriately, so no complaints there.    I can't remember when I've had to complain about a meal, and I really don't want to be quality control for the kitchen and have to ask for changes or send something back.  In the age of social media, who sends out food like this out of the kitchen?  2 stars for servers efforts and manager adjusting the bill but that's it.    Unfortunate but I don't think I'll be back.  This could have been the kind of place I can like.
