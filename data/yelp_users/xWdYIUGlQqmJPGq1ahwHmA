I tried the pull jackfruits po' boy(vegan) the first time, loved it! and the fish po' boy the second time and oh boy was I happy  with the fish po' boy since I'm a  pescatarian, it was probably the best fish sandwich I've had. I want to go again and try everything I can eat. Also please try the honey soaked beignets they serve so you can die happy.

Worst service ever, the manager was angry and screaming and was being very rude when we asked her about the meals, never going there again, she was screaming at all the waitresses.

Spinach ravioli was great. the portion was perfect for me but I don't eat a lot, I recommend ordering a side with it to be completely satisfied if you're super hungry, other than that the environment is very fun, alive and relaxing.

I like this spot and their food is good except I went the other day and I ordered the side of fries and there was a piece of hair in it, and this is not the first time I hear about issues with them being clean. Something to look at for sure

The pretzels are bad here and too salty and gave me a stomach ache and the cheese was terrible and too expensive for the portion and I'm never buying any food from here anymore -.-

I think I've been here over 15 times and I absolutely love it, made it a tradition to go get sushi from RA when we want to get sushi, haha the service is excellent, the servers are always smiling and happy to see us when we walk in. I usually go in for happy hour sushi since it's very cheap and tasty, I love the calamari, Vegas, and rainbow rolls, I highly recommend this location if you want to have a relaxing sushi date with a friend or anyone.

So this spot was really hard for me to find idk why haha, when I got in I didn't really have any expectations, the place is small and cute, the waitress was very nice, I ordered the sushi rolls with my friends which all were in very reasonable prices despite the time of the day it wasn't happy hour or anything, and when I started eating I was very impressed with the sushi! It was so good! I defiantly recommend this spot if you want to try super good sushi that isn't so expensive. Seriously wow!

Oh man have you  tried the sandwiches here? Do you know how good they taste and how perfect the price is for college students? You can build your own sandwich for 3 dollars! And it taste so darn good! I always pick up chips a muffin or the soup of the day as a side to go with it and I'm completely satisfied!   Everything is fresh here and most of the stuff if not all are organic, i even found make up brushes that I use all the time, and exotic amazing smell homemade soap! I love it! I love to shop here, I love that they ask if I want a paper or plastic bag, and the people that work there are always so nice.

I have never seen owners of a pizza place so passionate about their job, they are so nice! Tony makes sure his customers are doing fine all the time, me and my sister wanted ranch with our food and out of no where tony pops out and brings us ranch without even asking him lol! The cannoli I tried there is one of best ever! Not to mention if it's your first time there you get free tasty garlic knots! Go try it, you won't regret it!

This place has a lot of amazing vegan options that I really enjoy every time I go, I always take the left overs and eat them the next day and it still tastes amazing, their dessert is really good especially the banoffee pie, try it if you don't know what to get :)

Every time I'm in the area I come and grab macaroons, so many awesome flavors and the cupcakes aren't bad at all I love the salted Carmel cupcakes. The butter scotch and apricot macaroon was really good!

I come here to study all the time! Apart from it being a little too crowded and the tables are all taken its a good place to study, there's also a lot of cool blue ray movies to rent, and the view on the lake when studying is breath taking!

There isn't many options with no bacon haha but we ordered a vegan burger they had on the menu and it was really really good! Defiantly worth it and I would go back to have it again and we ordered garlic fries they were excellent as well, and 2 pretzels with a side of Nutella and super good sauces!! You can also rent a bike from the little cute van that's parked outside and they have a fun outdoor backyard seating area, ping pong table and jenga :)

This place is a vegetarian dream food truck. I already recommended it to all my friends not a lot of menu option but I'm not complaining, I'm not expecting a cheese factory size menu.

Vanilla bean custard was so light and delicious, i don't like over doing it for breakfast and the crepe was just the perfect level of sweetness and the portion was good too, very tasty, the service was very good and they even got us granola before we ate as a starter, and dark chocolate for dessert after we ate for free since it was our first time there. Very nice staff :)

I tried this place recently, I wasn't very impressed with the food, I think the menu was confusing the meals were scattered everywhere and it was so annoying how I had to flip it back and forth a million time with how big it was to figure out what I wanted to get, it  could use so much improvement, I tried the buttermilk waffles and if it wasn't for the fruits I added and the syrup I would probably have tasted nothing, my friend ordered the broccoli grilled cheese,I tried 3 bites of it and I didn't want to eat any more I could have made a better one at home honestly, my sister ordered the cross fit and her toast was burnt and the eggs tasted plain, but the place is pretty....  And the patio is really relaxing,the service was ehh.

This place is unbelievably cute, the food is good and super healthy. It's so hard to find good vegan food sometimes, places like the cutting board make me really happy, staff are super super friendly! They make you feel like family, and they have good dessert!

I came here the other day and ordered a pound of shrimps and a pound of mussles and they came with corn! I absolutely loved it! Other than the food being so darn good, the atmosphere made me feel like I'm on a pier near a beach, so much fun eating everything even when it gets super messy, not recommended for a first date though lol

First of all, idk how I didn't know about this place until now, the sandwiches are AMAZING! I absolutely enjoy the food here and not to mention getting full of eating only half of a sandwich and always take the other half and eat it later. The dirty mayo based sauce they have on their sandwiches is so good I even ask them to give me some in a little container to add to the sandwiches I make at home, the staff are nice and friendly and good service :) and all chicken is halal which is a plus ;)

Wow, so disappointed I read the reviews first but I didn't want to judge until I tried them for myself, the food was soooo bad! Wow I ordered the shrimp and grits, it was expensive and tasted so bad I didn't even finish it! The waitress brought the check and gave it to us without asking us if we wanted to order something else (we were thinking about dessert) everyone there looks like they don't know what they're doing, and I know they just opened recently but this is a franchise that's been out there for a while they should have trained their employees well, our bill was $40 we were only 2 people and we didn't order much, probably won't ever go there again, not to mention my stomach started hurting right after we left the place. I'm sorry but major improvement is highly needed!
