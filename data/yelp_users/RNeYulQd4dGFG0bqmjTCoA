The only reason this hooters gets 1star is because my nachos were on point and the ladies looked amazing! I must say I sat at my table for at least 15 minutes before I was given a flat beer. Then I waited another 10 before my order was taken. You would think that the hooters girls would be more friendly expecially how empty this place was for a Friday. Not sure if I will come back dew to the lack of hospitality.

I really don't give a place below 3 stars but this place is not what I expected. General rule of thumb is I do not go into a place and eat if the parking lot is empty but for this place I made an exception because of the  reviews on yelp. To make a long story short I paid 15$ for my puppy to eat the brisket  was just a bunch of fat in really bland bbq sauce and the rib tips was gristle and fat my dog hercules loved it the greens we mediocre and the black eye peas were just mush will not be going back.

It's freezing in my room and the heater does not work. Called the front desk and I was told there is nothing they can do. They could bring extra covers i waited for an hour and had to call again waited another 20 minutes. This place is horrible do not a waste your money it's dirty and it stinks I wish I could give this place 0 stars
