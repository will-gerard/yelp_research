I went into the mall for a regular return. There was no manager on duty and no sales associates in the store could authorize my return. When asked if they could call the manager they looked at me confused. I asked when the manager was to return they said one hour. This is extremely unprofessional and is an inconvenience. This will be the last time I ever shop at just sports.

Best Thai food I've ever had. Terrific service and very welcoming atmosphere. Ordered tiger on fire. Sooooo good. Can't wait to go there again when in the area!
