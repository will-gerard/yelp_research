bought a camera and a lens here a few weeks ago and i am nothing more than 100% pleased with everything about this place. Judith is amazing and so knowledgeable and extremely helpful. Morgan is very helpful and knowledgeable as well....both have been a great help to me in the process of getting my new camera. they have a wide selection of camera bags and accessories, filters, tripods etc...everything really that may need is there. They dont have a whole lot of cameras but they do have lenses you can choose from new and used :-)  if youre in scottsdale or looking for a great photo store....DEFINITELY CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!

LOVE THIS PLACE!!! its a little over priced though which suck especially if you're a student as I am. This place is close to campus so you'd think they'd offer some kind of student discount, buuuuuuut the do NOT! its 18 bucks to go in and I love going here because I am a photographer but that adds up after awhile

this place is great! but it is in dire need of a grocery store! the albertsons up the way sucks terribly! the staff there is the worst! I love the pavilions because its literally right on the other side of the wall from my house, it has a target! :-) Its got a great selection of stores, but definitely needs more. Lot of vacant spaces in there and OMG it SO needs a grocery store!

Phil is amazing and know exactly what and how to cut a guys hair, i HIGHLY recommend this place to any guy looking for a great barber! Prices are perfect, the place is super clean and has great stuff to look at on the walls while you wait but the best part is Phil...his ability to cut your hair and make you actually leave happy and not wondering whether or not they did something wrong....you won't have that worry here with phil, he knows exactly what and how to cut your hair! and also, he is so friendly and makes good conversation :-)

I love going to pride, but Phoenix really needs to consider 1) getting better artists to play the music aspect of it, because almost every year its not very good! The best was when pride had joan jett and berlin, every other year after that it has pretty much sucked....not worth staying for. For that reason and for the #2 reason...WHHHHYYYY HAVE PRIDE THE 3RD WEEKEND OF APRIL!!! its always hotter than hell and its just ridiculous to have it that weekend! its the same every freakin year only this year on saturday it hit like 105!!! is usually 98-99!!! walking around in that big ass dusty park for hours on end because HELLO WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SHOWING OUR PRIDE! lol....they need to consider having in MARCH! when the weather is still nice and people aren't dying from the heat! The crowd numbers would triple I think if they had they festival in March because everyone knows its cooler in March :-)

I go to this store because it is very close to my house. Other than that? I would never go! I shop usually at night and OMFG!!! this stores employees are HANDS DOWN the RUDEST people ever!!!!!!! The day crew isnt much better. It seems they are ALWAYS texting, or talking to one another about their problem, social life etc and NEVER say hello or thank you or anything like that! RUDE! RUDE! RUDE!!!!!!!! I have yet to have an experience in there where the cashier is nice or isnt texting on their phones...and is actually paying attention to the CUSTOMER!!! OMG! rude people!  and its ALWAYS hot as hell in that store!  TURN UP THE A/C! THIS IS AZ!

This place was always great in the past but my recent visit there sucked! The waiter was ABSOLUTELY horrible! I asked him 4 times for refills, asked him several times for more breadsticks, for silverware, and i never got any! I had to go and take the silverware from another table. Had to go find someone for a refill and for the breadsticks and STILL never got those breadsticks! and everrrrrryone who knows and goes there, knows its all about them breadsticks! Then to make matters worse, we asked for the bill....HE NEVER brought it! so we just got up  and went to the front and asked them for it and then he had the nerve to get upset at us because we didn't leave a tip and we complained! so sad, but the scottsdale location down on Osborn and Scottsdale rd is not a great experience, at least not anymore

absolutely beautiful! The fountain shoots up to 562ft into the sky and if you are there during a beautiful sunset it makes for a more spectacular experience!

WOW! Where to begin on JanMichaels abilities to transform a head from drab to chic! You'll have to excuse my weird phrase above but from first impression of JanMichael, I immediately was drawn to him as he is full of life and has a zest for styling hair that I can honestly say in my 14yrs here in the valley, Ive yet to see that "zest" that one may look for when shopping new hair stylists. JanMichael has that Zest and then some. He's very personable, very friendly, talkative I truly cannot remember the last time I got my hair done and i left feeling all happy and eager for my 3 weeks and get a cut and style routine to come around again.  As a hair stylist, yeah i mentioned he's very approachable as a person, but within seconds of sitting down at his station inside his salon, he immediately made me feel as if HELL!? he is my new stylist but because of his friendly personality and approach, i truly and without can say i felt as if he'd had been doing my hair for the 150th time or as if we've had been close friends my entire life with this individual. Amongst the personal level of professionalism you get him asking questions in regards to what you want done to your hair. But not all interrupting your thought, I'm still not quite sure how he was able to get his questions in w/o me thinking at least once "ugh lost my train of thought" the way that most hair stylists are. You know? the pushy, not a master of their craft at ALL! they are there for one thing and one thing only!...$$ JanMichael, like I said his personality is abundant amounts of eagerness and his love for his craft is the most apparent of any hair stylist that I have gone too, since I stopped going to mom, then stopped the barber shop routine and realized a barber shoppe? what am i 16? nope! far from 16, I'm 34 and it was shortly after turning 21 i had decided to spend almost as much as most barbers charge nowadays, put a few extra dollars towards a stylist and i never really had any stylist here in the valley that id dub my stylist! i had one a few years back but he cut and styled me but only three times before moving to the east coast to pursue his career ou t there! well, i hate to break it to him, but actually i wouldn't have i been given the chance, that in one sit with janmichael, i thought back to my old stylist and I'm like...REALLY!? I even said to janmichael, i dunno why or how ya do it, hell, if this happens to many of your clients but I'm thoroughly impressed with the amount of professionalism and apparent love that you have for your choice of career! not that I'm trying to put pressure on ya or anything, but being from NY, ya kinda have a level of expertise in mind when ya allow someone to cut at your head! haha! janmichael, if i wasn't floored enough at the fact that he is an AZ BORN AND RAISED! i know! an actual born here, raised here guy or gals ya just never meet them but he's from here and id say after my cut n color! oh yes bitches! he colored a dudes hair. keep in mind id never really allow anyone no matter here or back home NY to cut, color! n style in the first hair appt! well, cut n style! i wasn't all like, um janmichael, if ya could wash my hair that'd be great! BUT NO MORE! IMA WALK AWAY FROM THIS SALON WITH A SALON STYLE OF WHAT A CUT N STYLE SHOULD LIKE!  SERIOUSLY! I know i live in AZ, but c'mon! ya think i was raised in MAMAS FAMILY! HELL NAW! I born and raised in NY! and ladies and guys out there, y'all know we love to go to a salon if the length permits us or makes us go while in NY! Well, I hate to break it to ya's! this is isn't ny! this is an entirely all together world of people! However! if ya want quality service, with passion for the art of the styling of your hair, and without those Manhattan prices or all too many with that NY attitude, let me be the first to tell ya, ya WILL GET THAT! from my new hair stylist JanMichael! I let him color my hair as he had asked if i was interested in? i said OH REALLY!? ya saying I'm turning into my fatha or something? ha! we both laughed but the entire time it was just a pleasant experience from the moment we walked into each others presence to the moment i left. He is again, really quite a funny man! Im used to stone cold, small talk type of stylists and no offense to my city, but I've always gotten my hair cut n styled in old town or just Scottsdale proper. We all know that if one wants quality service from an individual in having jus quality all around service? ya sure the hell aint trying! to go to Metrocenter!? am I right or am I right? YEAH DAMN RIGHT IM RIGHT! YA GO TO SCOTTSDALE! sure I've been to salons in old town where ya pay a tad more to a grip more than most salons, but ya go to scottsdale for service, for quality, for stylists who know what they are doing and who are beaming with attitude so positive and eager to style yet another persons hair. JanMichael, if ya see this? I'm so excited that I finally came across a stylist like yourself. I am surely going to

Ok so I am a guy who likes to get pampered from time to time! Anything wrong with that? hell no! So listen up guys and gals! I found this place called Teres A nail bar located in Old Town Scottsdale and found it here on yelp. I was wantin to get  mani/pedi and had gone to FOUR different spots before finding these guys. They all turned me away for some reason. Geez! you think I had bear claws or something huh? I did not! haha! Teres was AWESOME!!! It was so relax, so zen like, it was truly a wonderful experience and GUYS i KNOW y'all like to get you some mani/pedis so DONT LIE! lol...this place SERIOUSLY is the place to go when you're looking for a great place with awesome AWESOME staff, the owner is one of the sweetest humans i think i have ever met! She was so accommodating! Her staff! was awesome and the prices were perfect! The atmosphere, motif, the entire thing was A++++++! if it seems like i am being a tad dramatic then well, deal with that haha! I am being serious here! This place FAR beats goin to one of the little asian ladies who get you in super fast and kick ya to the curb even faster. Teres, they take their time, they seem to really want to get to know you, they are accommodating as mentioned, they are sweet people who work there and they take a very clear and obvious interest in their clients and their work. You can tell they enjoy working for the owner, they love working in a awesome atmosphere and a hella kick ass location! and the prices!! AWESOME! SO GUYS, girls who are wantin that right place to go for the mani and for the pedi...seriously! please check this place out! you will not be dissatisfied! i promise you that! I honestly am looking forward to my next appointment :) They do these awesome salt or sugar scrubs on your hands and/or feet and WOW! I'm telling you is sweet! no pun intended! but its definitely something I did not expect to get while goin for a mani/pedi....so when you go, which you will! make sure to get either the salt or the sugar scrub...you guys will love it! I seriously cannot say enough about this place other than how genuinely pleased i was about my visit there and how wonderful the staff was :-) I will definitely be going back and you guys will definitely be going! TRUST ME! YOULL LOVE IT!!! :-) :-) it SO beats going to one of the places that don't spend their time on you like these girls do :-) So, CHECK IT OUT!! :-) :-)
