My friend and I went there for lunch today. Service was prompt and we had a seat outdoors. The server was helpful in describing the details of the food to two middle eastern food newbies. Princess Platter had a little of everything. The food was delicious! My favorite was the chicken kabobs with the garlic sauce. The hummus was excellent. I'm looking forward to their Friday lunch buffet!

Sooooo we didn't even get a chance to get seated and the place was NOT crowded whatsoever. They initially promised us a 30 minute wait then came back and said an hour. Maybe I'm just venting but what the hell? 5 p.m. On a Saturday is not the busiest. Not sure what happened? By the way I don't write negative reviews. This is a first for me but it really stood out. Will not go to Mimi's Cafe ever again...not that they care but ya my own peace of mind.

I would recommend this place to my family! These guys are great. Jason went above and beyond to ensure good customer service. I had 2 tires showing wires and needed an alignment. I was expecting something much more expensive than what I paid and they were able to finance with the choice of credit check or without. Additionally they provided a loaner for a couple hours so I could go pick up my kiddo. I plan on sticking with these dudes for further issues. Thanks again Jason.

Great place for drinks, nice place to chill. Very relaxed atmosphere. Great food, good bartenders and friendly crowd. I've become quite the regular.

Good stuff! 1st time my girl and I had been there and they did not let us down. Brady and his friend's restaurant lives up to the hype. Though I'm not necessarily a fan of poem I gave in and went for the brisket. Two words: DO IT!!

Really digging this place. The bartenders are attentive, cool, and know their stuff. In addition to this the TV's...love the TV's it's like a sports fans dream come true. Multiple TV's with a game on each. The food is of an excellent variety in addition to the beer list. The beer list is displayed on a HUGE screen over the bar and you're never left wondering over the quality of the beer. Check this place out, you won't regret it.

As a longtime fan of Chipotle I've frequented many. This Chipotle is by far the best. My girlfriend and I go to this site on a regular basis and we are always pleased. Exceptional customer service, great food, and they consistently go out of their way to be nice to us. If you've never tried Chipotle go this one! You'll be pleased!

Really digging this place. Great service, easygoing atmosphere, and good food. GF and I go to lunch here and have become well versed with their menu. Fave is the chicken hot bowl with Szechuan sauce and the 4 veggies. only complaint...no Coke Zero!
