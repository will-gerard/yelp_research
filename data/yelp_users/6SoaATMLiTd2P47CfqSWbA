I thought I was trying out a divey Chinese restaurant today.  It's in a broken down strip mall that looks like it was built too closely to the freeway.  Funny thing is that it wasn't a dive inside.  It was dark and a little plain, but the food and decor reminded me of East Coast Chinese places.  Fish tank.  Hot tea and spicy mustard on the table.  Awesome egg drop soup, and the egg rolls were fresh and crunchy.  The chicken & shrimp lunch entree was nothing special, but it came with a small pot of fried rice, which is another nice touch.  Fast service.  Reasonably priced.  The place was crowded, and now I know why.  I'll be back.

I love Chinese food, even most "bad" Chinese food, but this was too much for me. The cool exterior drew us in, and the inside decor didn't disappoint. Everything from the ceiling tiles to the fish tank to the Chinese zodiac place mats were right out of central casting. Unfortunately, the mu shu chicken was mostly under seasoned onions and cabbage with over cooked meat. It was still more tender than the sinewy beef in the fried rice, which was borderline inedible. Only the shrimp with green beans was a solid dish.  The service was good. (They rolled all 4 my shu crepes.) The prices were reasonable. Still, I wouldn't recommend this place unless you're desperate for Chinese dining.

That's life.  I really dug this place.  It was different.  Upscale, but not fancy.  Great Mexican food without a single taco or burrito.  Apparently, it's more like the cuisine of Mexico City, instead of the the Sonoran Mexican food we typically eat... but what do I know?  The defining feature of this place is blindingly pink building in a not-so-great neighborhood.  (It's not a bad neighborhood, but it's a contrast from the luxuries just a few miles North on Camelback.)  Inside, the place feels like a collection of narrow, cozy hallways, and the place settings at the tables are elaborate.  We started with a margarita and a fresh watermelon juice.  The margarita was a little too strong, but the watermelon juice was refreshing.  We started with guacamole.  I heard it was made table-side, but I got duped on that one.  The chips were very thick, like tostadas.  The guacamole, salsa, and pico were all good, but not special.  Next, we had a shrimp appetizer, served over a crepe.  The cream sauce was unexpectedly amazing!  I was trying to sop up the remains with tortilla chips.  It was foreshadowing of things to come... this place knows its sauces.  For the entree, we split a steak dish.  The steak was pounded thin, marinated, and grilled.  It was tender and delicious, but the sides were the stars.  There was a folded chicken enchilada in a mole sauce that was out of this world!  The rice, and the bean-stuffed pepper were also nice accompaniments.  (Next time, I think I'll just order the mole.)  We also had dessert, another crepe filled with ice cream and topped with a tequila carmel sauce.  The sauce was delicious.  Unfortunately, the cold ice cream made the crepe a little gummy and hard to eat.  The waiter was friendly and attentive.  The prices of everything except the entrees were very reasonable.  (The entrees are a little on the high side.)  If you want a different, upscale Mexican experience, this is the place for you.  Great date spot,too.

This wasn't the very best gelato I've had, but the sheer volume of flavors make this place a fun experience.  Without actually counting them, it looked like they had forty-odd flavors of gelato available that day.  (If it's 64 and hence the name... well, then, I'm an idiot as usual.)  I was there about 9pm on a Friday night, and the staff could not have been nicer.  Before deciding, I tasted several flavors and they heaped several more upon me.  "If you like that, then you'll like this..."  I must have collected almost ten of those multi-color mini gelato putty knives that they use as tasting utensils.  I finally chose two flavors:  the peanut butter oreo and the mud pie.  The peanut butter oreo had a rich peanut buttery taste and a smooth, creamy texture.  It was outstanding.  The mud pie was a combination of a few different flavors.  It was a little firmer and left the after taste of bad coffee.  The staff noticed I was sharing my gelato with my wife and gave me two of their sugar cone wedges that they jam into every cup.  I'm looking forward to going back and ordering two more flavors from their giant selection.

InPockets used to do most of their business from cakes and catering, only opening on weekdays.  They've recently expanded their menu and hours.  I didn't even notice their signature "pockets" on the menu anymore.  Looks:  InPockets still seems more bakery than restaurant.  They have a few tables in front of a display case, filled with impressive pastries.  Wedding cakes decorate their front windows.  Food:  Breakfast and sandwiches, but they are AWESOME sandwiches.  We had the Santa Fe chicken and the chicken salad.  Each comes on a choice of FRESHLY BAKED ciabatta or focaccia.  Both breads were amazing.  The chicken salad was the best I've ever had, with cranberries and walnuts in it.  It tastes like food from a caterer.  I recommend the cole slaw over the pasta salad for your side.  We also had a piece of carrot cake, which was quite good.  Value:  The sandwiches were $8.  (Maybe a tad pricey w/o a hot side or a drink.)  The small piece of carrot cake was good value at $1.50.  The waffles and/or French toast at breakfast looked like a good deal at $4.  Service:  Just a counter, but I think the owner was working.  She was very nice.  Verdict:  I'll definitely go back.  The freshly baked bread alone is worth the trip.

Spices is an interesting name for a restaurant with such delicate flavor combinations. A few days ago, I ordered my usual, the chicken schwarma plate with rice. Unlike a garlicky gyro with tzatziki, the small pieces of spiced chicken don't overpower the rice pilaf. The light lemon dressing of the Israeli salad is the highlight though, adding crisp freshness to the plate. And I used to to dislike the thin tahini because it wasn't hummus, but now I appreciate the sesame flavor it provides. For fast casual Mediterranean, it's hard to do better.

I don't exactly have an expert palette when it comes to sushi.  I stick to the basics and seek out cheap happy hours.  Sushiya definitely impressed me, and I think even sushi snobs would agree.  The restaurant setting was clean, but mostly unremarkable.  One chef worked away behind the sushi bar.  We got there for happy hour which was fantastic.  Salmon nigiri was a steal for only $2.50.  The fish cuts were long and thin, and the fish was moist and seemed fresh.  Ditto for the yellowtail nigiri ($4, not on happy hour).  Even the rice had a good flavor/texture.  I really enjoyed the killer roll (eel roll w/ salmon on top), which was good value at $6.50 on happy hour.  There was a thick menu of very unique combination rolls that were artistically prepared.  For instance, the caterpillar roll has carrot eyes and sprout antennae.  Like I said, I usually keep it basic, but I'm looking forward to branching out my sushi experiences at Sushiya.  Full disclosure:  The $1 edamame  was good (I liked the sea salt), but the California roll was only OK.  They have specials which run during football games.  I'll keep that in mind for 2011.

I won't deny that I'm typically a comfort-food guy, but Noca is where I go when I'm looking for haute cuisine.  Their menu constantly rotates and usually contains a half-dozen words that I've only heard on Chopped.  I check ahead on the website, especially since I don't eat pork, and there are hundreds of different names for pork.  On Wednesday, I found the restaurant to be strangely empty.  We started with a glass of wine, a Belgian beer, and my first-ever Panzanella, an Italian bread salad.  The roasted vegetables, croutons, pecorino, and balsamic dressing meshed fantastically.  It was a real highlight, moreso than the squash chutney amuse bouche or the sliced bread served without butter or oil.  (I'm not complaining about these free items; they were tasty, but unspectacular.)  We played it safe on the entrees, opting for skirt steak and striped bass.  The striped bass was absolutely perfectly cooked, and beautifully plated.  It was moist with a very crispy skin, and complemented well by rainbow carrots and a farro dish that resembled brown fried rice.  The marinated steak was sliced over smashed potatoes with straw mushrooms.  It was tender and delicious, but a little cold when it arrived.  The service was fantastic, answering questions and never rushing us.  Along with the signature cotton candy (today's flavor was grape), they also threw in a glass of champagne and a cookie for each of us, since it was a special occasion.  Although the portion sizes are a little small, the price is reasonable, and the quality is top notch.  Noca did more than enough to retain its crown as my favorite restaurant in Phoenix.

I haven't spent much time in Downtown Mesa, but this place catches my eye every time.  It's caddy-corner to the Mesa Arts Center, with a lively, inviting patio out front.  The inside is artistically decorated with some exposed brick and large paitings on one wall.  The other wall is a bar, serving a sizable wine list and bottles from several local breweries.  (No draft beers.)  There's also a small stage for live music.  It's a nice atmosphere for a date.  Unfortunately, the food was lacking.  A crusty baguette was served before our meals with a homemade butter concotion that had way too many onions.  I ordered the fish of the day, escolar, served over vegetable risotto ($29).  The fish was cooked moist and succulent, but it was very buttery and carried some unrecognizable smoky flavor.  The risotto had a nice cheesy taste, but I didn't see many vegetables in it, and it was also very heavy and oily.  In between these layers were some tasty, vinegary wilted greens, but I could barely distinguish them sandwiched between the super rich fish and risotto.  On the plus side, my wife's salmon salad was a nice offering and good value ($11).  With asparagus, roasted red peppers, and multi-colored grape tomatoes, it was pleasing to the eye.  The piece of salmon on top was surprisingly large, and cooked perfectly medium rare.  I'd definitely stop in for a drink or to relax on the patio, but I doubt I'll grab dinner again here any time soon.

Hot Pockets!  Every time I come here, I obsess about which pasty to pick.  Much later, I remember that it doesn't matter.  There are no big, bold flavors to be had... I'm here for the concept.  The flaky, firm dough that houses the chosen filling is the star of the show.  Second billing is the pub ambience, from the large wooden tables to the metal plates.  Third is the large beer list.  All of the above comes for a great value.  $6.50 cent glasses of wine.  $3 Guinness on Wednesdays.  And the $3 Irish Car Bomb is legitimately the best drink deal in Arizona.

Wood-fired pizzas.  Chopped salads.  What's not to like?  Sauce offers a consistently good product.  My portabella and artichoke pizza ($10) was perfectly round, and enough for 1 large serving or two small servings.  The crust was thin and even and nicely charred on the bottom.  The slices were easy to pick up and fold.  The sauce and cheese were good, but not outstanding.  The portabella mushrooms were cut into ribbons and looked almost like anchovies.  The artichokes were the star of the dish.  Many places will just peel off thin layers of the artichoke heart for a topping, but Sauce actually sliced the artichoke heart into chunks, so it stayed juicy and had some substance.  It was a nice presentation.  My wife was not enamored with her chopped vegetable salad ($7), although I liked it.  I thought the chopped asaragus and corn added some distinctive flavors.  Dining with my wife often requires footnotes.  (1) She subbed feta cheese for parmesan and was happy with that tradeoff.  (2) She noticed they forgot avocado in the salad, which the restaurant corrected by bringing out a small dish of avocado.  Accidents happen.  At least they fixed it promptly and courteously.  It's not the food that bugs me at Sauce; it's the atmosphere.  They're serving an upscale product in a fast casual setting.  After ordering at the counter, food is served in a dining area not unlike an office cafeteria.  The patio is no better, overlooking a parking lot and a dumpster.  It's not a place to reminisce over a glass of wine (which they sell.)  Am I expecting too much from a fast casual restaurant with reasonable prices?... probably.  I'm calling this a "me" problem and giving 4 stars based on the food alone.

Looks:  Stripmall bar with a small outdoor patio.  Inside was dark with cheap furniture... your standard dive bar.  Crowd:  Must have been senior citizen night.  The place wreaked of despair.  Granted, it was Monday at 6pm.  I've heard the place gets a decent crowd on other nights.  Food:  We got 2 burgers and a chicken sandwich and they were all fairly awful.  The burgers were slightly overcooked, on big wonderbread buns fresh from the bag.  No lettuce or tomato.  The fries and tater tots were decent, though clearly not homemade.  Value:  Beers were very cheap during happy hour.  The food prices were about what you'd expect from a bar... maybe slightly higher.  The burgers were on special for $7.  Service:  Good.  Miscellaneous:  Beers were available in mini-pitchers, which I think is a nice touch.  The patio is dog friendly.  Verdict:  I'll never eat there again.  That's for sure.  It's an OK place to grab a beer, but there are lots of other (better) food & drink choices around this place.

Ocean Blue is a little mom and pop carribean joint in a Chandler Blvd strip mall.  I feel bad for the owners as they see how packed Subway is next door.  I guess it's hard to compete with five-dollar footlongs.  The restaurant used to be burrito chain, and the inside looks roughly the same as it did before.  It's an odd layout where the tables are cramped by the bar, which seems always empty.  I brought a real live Jamaican guy with me for lunch, so I could get his opinions as well.  It turns out that I didn't need much expert insight.  We opted for the buffet which had exactly 5 items:  jerk chicken, blackened tilapia, mayo-based macaroni salad, red beans & rice, and some kind of  cinammon pie for dessert.  Notice there were no vegetables.  However, there was no red meat or fried items, so it wasn't totally unhealthy.  The jerk chicken was bone-in dark meat pieces that had nice flavor but not much heat.  Everything was good (except the dessert), but nothing was outstanding.  I even enjoyed the macaroni salad.  There just wasn't much variety, and the food suffered from "looking like something I could make myself at home", even though I'm usually too lazy to do so.  The dessert was the lone disappointment.  It tasted like pumpkin pie mixed with stale cornbread.  Well, the Jamaican guy liked it, and the price was only $8, but I still can't go above 2 stars for this place.  The buffet items change daily, and they have a non-buffet menu, so maybe a 2nd experience will wow me more than the first.

Went back because a friend had a groupon.  Technically, it was a groupon wannabe from VoicePlaces.  We skipped the buffet and ordered off the menu.  We tried once of each Jamaican pattie flavor (beef, spinach, jerk chicken, curry chicken), and made 2 safe sandwich choices (jerk chicken and jerk turkey burger).  The patties were all tasty, and they were a good value at only $2 each.  I particularly liked the curry chicken and the spinach flavors.  The sandwiches were disappointing... very small with no side dishes for $6 each.  The waiter threw in a free order of "festivals" for us, but they weren't as festive as one would imagine.  They were just fried dough and empty calories.  Think beignets without any powdered sugar.  So, it's worth checking out this place for the $2 patties and $1 beers during happy hour ($2 Red Stripe), but that's about it.  Nothing else seemed outstanding or a great value, and the ambience leaves something to be desired.

"Oh, our happy hour starts later because Wednesdays are hip hop night."  Well, OK then.  It was a weird experience at Mijana, but I thought the food was first rate.  I started with Lebanese beer named Alamaza.  It was a refreshing pilsner like a Heineken or a Carlsberg.  Fresh baked pita are served to the table with zatar, a dried herb and oil dipping sauce.  The pita had that homemade softness and yeasty flavor.  It wasn't chewy or sweet like store bought.  The zatar had a subtle flavor but a lot of aroma, smells that reminded me of my trips to the Middle East.  Hold off on pita refills because more come with dinner.  We ordered the shawarma combo for two, except it may as well have been a shawarma combo for 8.  It came on a big platter with hummus, rice, and a lightly dressed salad.  We had leftovers for days.  (I wish there was more hummus... we actually finished that.)  The chicken was better than the beef, which was a little tough.  Both were flavorful.  The rice had a light seasoning, but didn't overwhelm the meat.  Service was slow, but not inordinately slow.  Without any complaining, they comp'd us a free slice of chocolate cake.  The place has a large bar on one end, a stage on the other, and about as many tables and chairs as you can fit in between, all in neatly arranged rows.  It seems like they use it for receptions because they do.  They also have a night dedicated to salsa dancing, one for salsa dancing, and I'm forgetting one or two others.  They also have belly dancers on some nights... there's a lot going on at Mijana.

This restaurant used to be Thai Pots at a different storefront in the same strip mall.  The owner said they switched names to set up an LLC because their accountant was screwing them.  I hate accountants (except for my dad and my wife.)  Looks:  The place is rather non-descipt inside.  It looks new and clean.  Nice, but not fine dining.  The teak wood on the walls was a nice touch.  Food:  Pretty standard Thai menu.  Noodle dishes, curries, etc.  We got the drunken noodles and the cashew chicken, substituting tofu for chicken.  The drunken noodles were excellent.  I really liked the flat noodles and sweet/spicy brown sauce.   Lots of vegetables and chicken and a large portion overall.  The cashew tofu was good, but not great.  Stir-fry dishes have a low ceiling, in my opinion.  Value:  Both dishes were $11, about what you'd expect to pay for Thai food, maybe slightly higher.  The portions were sizable, making the place a good value.  Service:  Excellent.  They actually apologized for slow delivery of food, but we didn't even notice a delay.  Miscellaneous:  The menus still said Thai Pots and claimed to be oldest Thai restaurant in Chandler.  Verdict:  I'll definitely go back.  The place wasn't fantastic enough to monopolize my Thai food business, but it's tasty and a good value, and close to my house.

After much debate on this important issue of our times, I believe Zinburger is the best burger in town.  Saturday reaffirmed my belief.  The casual restaurant is bright and open, but you're not there for the ambience.  The menu is confusing, but you can basically order exactly what toppings you'd like a la carte without busting your wallet.  (That includes substituting a chicken breast or turkey patty.)  I recommend havarti cheese and either avocado or fried egg, but not both.  The egg brioche bun is large, but it's almost necessary to sop up all the moisture and flavors.  And the fries and sides stand up to the burger.  We ordered our favorite, zucchini fries.  That's healthy, right?  Not really, but the battered, fried zucchini sticks sprinkled with parmesan are amazing.  The onion rings suffered by comparison, but they were also more than adequate.  We were too full for shakes on this visit, but I can assure you that they're also delicious.  My one issue with this place is that it's hard to finish a burger without it falling apart.  Maybe that's a result of my topping choices.  That's a small burden to bare... I'll bring a bib and a dropcloth for burgers this good.

I used to make fun of the notion of a business renting space to sell $3 popsicles, but Betty has won me over.  Her paletas are legit.  Her storefront is located on the edge of the Downtown Chandler business district.  When you walk in, the first thing you notice is how immaculately clean and bright it is.  There's usually only one clerk working because all he does is pull popsicles from freezers, but these are some awesome Mexican popsicles.  They have fresh, in-season ingredients and unique flavor combinations.  I prefer the paletas with cream in them because of the softer texture.  Yesterday, they had both of my favorites on hand.  You can taste the distinctive freshness of the fruit in the fresa con crema (strawberries and cream).  The berries are not pulverized into powder; you sitll get some texture.  You get even more texture in the nuez (roasted pecan) with whole pecans in it.  I also enjoy the chocolate, the arroz con leche, and my wife's favorite is the key lime pie.  It has a graham cracker-like crust on one side of the popsicle.  I'm less of a fan of the paletas without cream because they're hard like a block of ice, but I still appreciate the bold flavors of the fresh fruit and spices.  This place has a lot going for it.  I like their marketing.  They have a bite mark in their popsicle mold, and attach a peelable sticker on every wrapper.  (uh... for kids, not for me... let's just move on.)  They regularly offer discounts on coupon sites.  They provide fruit flavored water to their patrons.  They have dog popsicles.  (I'm dying to buy one for one of my friend's dogs and/or to pass off to my friend as a human popsicle and see how long it takes him to realize the joke.)  The place just seems like a nice family business in the sea of chain restaurants known as Phoenix.

Remember 98 South Wine Bar?... or the 2nd 98 South Wine Bar?... or Fat Cat?  That space in Downtown Chandler has a new tenant, and they seem like a keeper.  DC Steak House is a rarity in Phoenix; a mid-priced, independent steak houses in a sea of chain restaurants and a la carte wallet busters.  Looks:  Well, it does look fairly similar to the previous restaurants, except they changed the bar area and the art.  I like it.  It's elegant and not too dark or too partitioned.  There's a mural on one wall that I think the owner painted.  The place is a nice addition to Downtown, which is still fighting off the urban sprawl of mega-chains.  Crowd:  Seemed happening, although it was Opening Night.  A wide mix of young and old.  Food:  My eye was drawn to the large selection of fish, but I decided to go with steak at a steak house.  The salad was solid.  I especially liked the Italian dressing with a little Feta cheese in it.  Bread was OK.  My steak was great, tender, flavorful, and perfectly cooked.  Served with a (undercooked) baked potato, and sauteed mushrooms.  My friend ordered the walleye.  I was a big fan, but he said it was a little bland compared to what he catches in Minnesota.  Maybe that was a fish story.  Value:  Here's where I thought this place shined.  Meals were in the $18-30 range, including salad and potato.  They have $10 sandwiches, too, but they're not served on Fri/Sat until after 9pm.  Seems fair.  Service:  Service was slow, although it was Opening Night.  They also screwed up my friend's appetizer, serving him the wrong kind of wing sauce.  However, the people could not have been nicer.  The owner apologized and bought us desserts.  (Chocolate Decadence Cake was delicious, although a little rich for my taste.)  Then, the chef came out , shook our hands, and bought us drinks.  I felt like I was in a place where people would remember my name, even though they surely won't.  Miscellaneous:  A lot of decisions haven't been made yet.  Will they serve lunch?  What will they do for happy hour? (a crucial decision in my mind.)  Even the menu will likely vary in the coming months.  Verdict:  I don't go out for steaks often, even reasonably priced ones, but I'll definitely be back to DC Steakhouse to see my new "friends."  I've got my eye on the steak sandwich for next time.

I liked everything about this place... except the coffee.  Big open space.  Couches.  Stage for live music.  I guess the pastry selection could use a boost, but mostly it's the coffee.  My Americano had that maple, brown sugar taste instead of the heavy roasted flavor I enjoy. Did I get a bad cup as an aberration?  Maybe.  Is it just a personal preference issue?  Perhaps.  I'm willing to give SoZo another try.  Maybe it's just not my cup of tea.

The sauce is usually the under-appreciated element of pizza, but it's front and center at Spinato's.  One's opinion of Spinato's hinges almost totally on his opinion of the unusually sweet sauce.  After yesterday's experience, I've decided that I love Spinato's as on occasional treat, but it's a little rich to be my go-to pizza place.  Everything besides the sauce on the pizza was nearly beyond reproach.  The crust was thin and crisp, but not like a cracker.  It still had some chewiness.  The aforementioned sauce and cheese went nearly out to edges of the pie.  The pizza was cut into squares and toppings were carefully and evenly applied.  The mushrooms were outstanding because they're the canned mushrooms that remain plump and juicy when cooking.  The bell peppers and ricotta cheese were OK, although the ricotta added even more sweetness.  One renegade black olive somehow made it on my pizza, which I found endearing.  If you're not in a pizza mood, they have a full menu with sandwiches, salads, calzones, etc.  They actually have a calzone stuffed with spaghetti.  On a previous visit, we ordered it just as a conversation topic, leading to jokes like "... so why are Americans getting fatter?"  I have to admit that the little carbohydrate bomb was pretty tasty.  Nothing was special about the restaurant itself.  (After all, it's a converted Chili's.)  But the pizza is special.  It's high quality and definitely distinctive, which is rare to say about pizza.

Wow!  I haven't eaten at a Rally's in like 15 years.  Almost every one in Pittsburgh was in a pretty ghetto area.  I had to check out the new one in Chandler because it will be nice to eat at a Rally's without constantly  thinking, "Don't make eye contact."  The hamburger was below average.  It fits right in with Jack in the Box, Burger King, Carl's Jr, etc.  (Maybe Sonic is the best comparison.)  It's a notch below my favorites of In & Out, Wendy's, and Whataburger.  Note:  McDonald's is in its own class because it doesn't even seem like meat... you could give me a full kitchen and a chemistry set, and I could never make anything that tastes remotely like McDonald's.  The fries were outstanding, probably the best of all fast food fries.  They're extra crispy with a spicy seasoning.  (In my youth, I remember them having an orange cheetoh tint to them, but they looked normal today.  You could even see potato skin on the ends of them.  Nothing else stood out.  They have hot dogs and wings, both of which are a little unusual for fast food places.  Like competitors, they've added giant hamburgers to keep pace with fat America.  Miscellaneous tip:  The parking lot is so incompetently designed that FEMA must somehow be responsible.  You might want to park behind the restaurant.

Is this heaven?... no, it's Chandler.  This small counter-style restaurant in a strip mall is a solid choice for lunch.  I've had the gyro and the Greek salad here before, but today I stepped it up for the gyro platter.  It was outstanding.  For $9, I got food served to me on 3 different plates.  There was a generous portion of gyro meat, and french fries served with sliced tomatoes & onions and tzatziki.  Then, there was separate side greek salad and a pita.  That's a lot to review.  The gyro meat was about what you'd expect.  At least it looks legit because they cut it from one of those giant meat cylinders.  The french fries were fantastic, thick cut but crispy with a seasoning salt on them.  The tzatziki was thicky and lumpy, with a strong dill flavor (and I mean all of that as a compliment.  It was good stuff.)  The salad was crisp and fresh with an acidic Greek dressing and some feta cheese.  It was mostly lettuce, but there was tomato, onion, and a single olive & pepperoccini to make it a nice presentation.  And finally, the pita was grilled warm and toasty, as it should be at a place named Pita Heaven.  I ate my entire salad, and about half of the rest.  $9 is a little pricey for lunch, but not when you make two meals out of it.  There is a large menu, but I've never strayed from the Mediterranean choices.  If you like Chicago hot dogs or beef sandwiches, they've got you covered.  If you're on a health kick, the Greek salad with chicken is a healthy, but satisfying option.

It's hard to review Can't Stop Smoking BBQ without referencing Rudy's BBQ right across the street.  I give Rudy's the edge on atmosphere, and the meats themselves were juicier and a little more flavorful... but EVERY other possible advantage goes to Can't Stop Smoking (CSS).  The sides, sauces, portions, value, variety, healthiness, accessibility, etc all favor CSS.  Upon entering, you grab an impressively heavy aluminum tray and go through a cafeteria line acquiring sliced meats.  I got a 2-meat combo, with a half-ear of corn, 2 sides, cornbread muffin, and a drink for $10.  (They also email coupons and have a stamp card.... which knocked the price down closer to $7.)  The turkey and brisket were both super lean, which I happen to like, even though that made them somewhat dry.  The turkey had a nice smokey flavor, but the dry rub on the brisket was uneven and overly salty/spicy in some bites.  No big deal because I enjoyed both the standard and spicy BBQ sauce options much better than the sauce at Rudy's.  The muffin and mac & cheese were both above average.  Amazingly, the corn wasn't totally overcooked like at most places, but I discovered that I hate mustard greens and had wasted one of my choices of sides.  Some of my friends ordered the ribs and said that was the best thing on the menu.  So where does that leave us?  Is it possible that I like the meat better at Rudy's and still like CSS better?  Yes, I think so.  I didn't have to wait in a huge line, struggle to find a table, or slice huge hunks of fat off my brisket.  (I also didn't feel gross when I left.)  I was able to order a combo, instead of "decoding" the menu to determine how much meat to order for my Wonderbread.  Can't Stop Smoking is a more commercial, more conventional experience than Rudy's, but I liked it.

To put it simply, this is the best gelato I've had in the U.S.  (In an attempt at retaining some food snob credentials, I'll say that the gelato at San Crispino Gelateria in Rome was still better.)  Cool Gelato Italiano is in a great location on the Scottsdale Mall, between the Scottsdale Museums of Performing Arts and Contemporary Arts.  On the summer Saturday night that I was there, there were bands playing, dancing shows, and lots of foot traffic.  It was just a lively atmosphere.  The gelato shop itself is bright and clean and has a European feel to it.  In fact, a few rather stoic Europeans were serving the gelato.  I heard accents that I assume were Italian.  Customer service was fine, but it wasn't their paramount concern.  Cool Italian Gelato limits customers to only two tastings, and the staff was visibly unhappy about breaking my wife's $20 bill so she could buy a $1 bottle of water.  The main focus of any review of a gelato shop should be... (duh) the gelato!  And the gelato here was outstanding.  Every one that I tried was very creamy and bursting with flavor.  I ordered 2 flavors (1 cup).  The mint chocolate chip was very minty, but in a refreshing way, not a medicinal way.  The Magnum had a subtle undertone of caramel.  (Note: The mint chocolate chip overwhelmed spoonfuls that featured both it and Magnum flavors.)  I also tried the peach gelato.  It was a little sweet for my taste, but it had the same velvety texture as the other flavors.  I highly recommend going here on a hot summer day (or night.)  Sit outside, people watch, and enjoy the best gelato this side of Rome.

Rudy!  Rudy!  Rudy!  Rudy!  If you live anywhere near I-10, you've probably seen that eyesore of a red barn that is Rudy's BBQ.  It's a dining experience unlike any other in the Valley.  It's like a delicatessen, crossed with a picnic, and covered in BBQ sauce.  The BBQ is really good, but I learned a few things that will make my experience even better next time.  Tip #1:  Show up early for lunch.  It's not as packed as when it first opened, but we waited about 10 minutes to order at 11:45.  Wait until 12:15 and you'll have a long line and trouble finding seats.  Tip #2:  Understand what you're getting.  You can order sandwiches, but most people order meat by the pound.  The sign says $6.49 for a half pound of brisket, but you pay what it weighs.  My portion was over $7.  I wouldn't recommend the "cutter's choice" option.  I saved some pocket change, but my brisket didn't look as moist or as lean as my friends'.  Tip #3:  Order pint sides and share them among your friends.  It's better value.  They serve the food in what looks to be a wax paper lined milk carton.  After navigating the condiment bar (try the cherry peppers), you can look for a small wooden picnic table, or take up part of a large table covered with red and white table cloths.  As for the food itself, the brisket had a great smokey flavor, but it was dry in places, and had large hunks of fat.  I blame myself for ordering "cutter's choice."  Rookie mistake.  The cole slaw was really good.  The cabbage was minced pretty fine, and it was sweet and creamy, but not too creamy.  The new potatoes were just roasted potatoes in butter.  They definitely needed salt, and the inch of melted butter in the bottom of the styrofoarm bowl was an unappetizing visual.  There were two bbq sauces on the table.  I liked the tangy, vinegary flavor.  One was supposed to be spicier than the other, but they tasted similar to me.  Both had kick.  I have some friends in Austin, TX that think Rudy's rivals Salt Lick BBQ, and I think they're crazy.  It's good, but it's not that good.  The smokey flavor of the brisket definitely stood out, though.  I'm looking forward to my next visit, when I can navigate the menu a little easier.

From the corner that brought you Hitts, Howie's, and the Regal Beagle comes... BEEF O'BRADY'S.  Awful location, awful name.  The food, however, was pretty decent for bar food.  My burger had fresh toppings and a tasty brioche bun, even though the patty seemed to be pre-formed.  The onion rings were battered.  I prefer breaded, but the spicy dipping sauce was delicious.  And that's about all there was to say that's good about this place.  It was not cheap.  The burger was $8.50, and the onion rings cost extra.  They snuck in a charge for cheese on my friend's burger, whereas it was included on mine.  Despite having several nice TV's, the viewing angles weren't great to see multiple TVs.  And the staff wasn't up to speed on the menu or the bill.  (It's a new place, so I guess I should cut them some slack.)  The place has potential for happy hour.  $2 domestic drafts.  $4 import drafts with a nice selection.  Large outdoor patio.  But I think the location dooms Beef O'Brady's to a dead crowd except for maybe Friday happy hour.

There's an adage that states pizza is like sex; even when it's bad, it's still pretty good.  Mellow Mushroom disproved this theory for me last night.  On this historic night, I had the worst pizza of my life, and I'm dishing out my first ever one-star review.  We ordered a $9 Greek salad.  The thinly cut vegetables (i.e. pizza toppings) weren't plentiful enough to distract us from the fact that the bagged iceberg lettuce was browning.  I did enjoy the creamy Italian dressing, which they named "esperanza".  I can't find anything nice to say about the pizza.  It was an abomination.  The crust was uneven and undercooked in places, and it was very sweet with a hint of cinnamon, like eating a cinnamon raisin bagel.  The red sauce was also sweet.  The cheese was plasticky and tasteless.  Each piece of our "Kosmic Karma" pie was topped with a Roma tomato slice and a drizzle of pesto sauce, which now seems like a better alternative to the red sauce, but combined to make the pizza soggy.  And to boot, this medium, vegetarian pizza was insanely expensive at $20. Twenty Bucks!  I can say that the service was good, and I liked the decor.  It's a brick, multi-level building, a remnant from the Rock Bottom that was the previous tenant.  I also really liked the movie theater theme of this restaurant, which was pretty cool.  (I found out that each Mellow Mushroom location has a different theme.  I'd been to one other location that had a much weaker theme, but much better food.)  I was anything but Mellow when I left dinner last night.  Regretful Mushroom would be a better name.

Steakies' menu had an air of authenticity to it, but that air dissipated as soon as I saw my cheesesteak.  (The ridiculous name should have tipped me off that I was in trouble.)  As a Pennsylvania native, I like that they offered a choice of Cheese Whiz or provolone.  I like that they called their cold sandwiches "hoagies".  I like that they offer a roast pork sandwich, even though I won't touch that filthy swine.  :)  What I DON'T like was the gigantic bread bowl that housed my meat & cheese.  It was a semi-circle bun, stuffed with the ingredients, and thick enough to sop up a can of clam chowder.  I went against my usual nature and ordered provolone on my cheesesteak, ("a provy steak").  I immediately wished I'd said "wiz", even though there's not enough Cheese Whiz in Wisconsin to moisten that sponge of a bun.  The other big drawback was the prices.  A basic sandwich and basket of fries ran me $13.  Upcharges for every topping, even the cheese.  Plus, I'm salty because they stiffed me on trying to use a groupon for me and a groupon for my friend in the same visit.  Sure, they're technically right, but technically they need all the return business they can get.  Other tidbits: Fries - Decent, but a little garlicky for my taste. Decor - Half bar, half-counter restaurant.  Beer prices seemed cheap, and they had a few TVs.  Looked very much like the NYPD that was there before it.  I'll definitely go back exactly once to use that other groupon, and then THAT'S IT.  Forefathers is only a mile away with a much better product.

It was an interesting night at Chao that had me teetering on 3 vs 4 stars.  Chao used to be Lattitude 8 in Downtown Chandler, one storefront south of the main square.  Maybe that subtle distinction was hurting their business, or maybe the rent was too high, or maybe they just wanted to expand.  Now, they're in a Chandler strip mall dominated by Oregano's, which is always packed.  The atmosphere at Chao was open and modern.  The restaurant has a large bar area and a large patio.  It also has a private room separated by a sliding glass door.  On Saturday night, there was a rowdy, overcrowded party in the private room which involved TWO different people walking face first in the glass door.  (Free entertainment!)  We started with one of two Malbecs from the surprising wine list, along with a Brazilian beer named Xingu.  We enjoyed both drinks immensely.  We then moved straight to entrees with the $12 Pad Thai (w/ chicken) and the $14 Prik King (w/ steak).  The flavors of both dishes seemed complex and well-developed, more so than most Thai places.  The Pad Thai wasn't overly sweet, like it so often is.  The meat in the Prik King was very tender.  The portions were sufficient, but not huge.    There were a few marks against Chao, though.  The Prik King was very spicy, likely a 4 on the typical 5-point scale at Thai restaurants.  We weren't asked for a spice level.  I don't even recall the menu stating the dish was spicy at all.  That wasn't a major issue for me, but it certainly would be for some.  Also, I feel the dishes were a little overpriced, and the service was quite slow.  This was especially noticeable in the twenty minutes it took to pay our check.  By the time the bill was finally paid, we were the last patrons there.  You'd think they'd be more eager to see us off.  Considering how much we liked the food, these issues won't make me say, "Ciao" to Chao.

I wanted to like The Ivy. I really did. It's close to my house. It's a spot with a nice bar and great ambience, even when it was Chao. Plus, it's on my discount card.  And I love Mediterranean food. I stick to the basics, and they're hard to screw up, but The Ivy managed that feat. They blasted our entrees, overcooking the chicken and shrimp kebabs to toughness. They also left some sinew on the chewy chicken.  On the plus side, the rice was excellent and the soft, seasoned pitas were even better. The hummus was about average and the salad was decent, although the dressing was a little sweet for my taste. At least there was good live music. Otherwise, the night might have been a big fat Greek disappointment.
