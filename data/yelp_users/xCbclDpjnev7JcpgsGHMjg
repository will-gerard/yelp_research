Walgreens here is pretty good. Customer service is great. Mexican comes here. It is a bit pricey but hey, when you need something quick and don't want to wait in line, this is the next best thing. This is a good location

Love Costco. Getting pricier, but I love their food. I love their selection and quality of food. They're toilet paper, paper towels and water are so cheap and last me for months. The lines suck so me and my girl love to shop during the week after work since it's less crowded. But then you miss out on the free food samples. Which I happened to love. Their hot dogs, pizza and chicken bake is amazing. I love shopping here.

All time best Mexican bakery in Arizona. They have perfected the taste of authentic Mexican bakery. I love stopping in on winter mornings, early, and get the smell of the fresh bread in the oven. Every single pan dulce, translates " sweet bread" is super delicious. It's great with milk, hot chocolate and coffee! They even have beef burritos wrapped in their own flour tortillas. They sell them as well. And I love the names of each bread. They each mean something and tie in to the shape and taste of the bread. So when you drop in ask for the names of the ones you choose. I've been going here since I was a young buck. Still going to this day. Again, the best of the best. I would drive an hour to come here if I lived that far away. And I guarantee everyone who knows of La Purisima will back me up. Keep doing what you're doing paisanos!

Me and my girlfriend were craving wings and we decided on this place. We ordered take out and picked up 24 buffalo wings. The wings looked like they were on steroids. They didn't taste good at all. They were rubbery and some of them didn't look fully cooked. We were so disgusted by it we threw them all away. We then proceeded to sonics and got us some burgers.

Terrible food, terrible service. I had the Turkey Avocado BLT. Turkey was mushy, and very gamy. The bread was rubbery, very difficult to chew. My girlfriend ordered the Asian chicken salad. All we got was old, romaine lettuce with chicken and dressing. Very plain. Again, the staff was short and dry, not friendly at all. Will not be coming here again that's for sure!

This location of Hot Bagel is the best. The bagel, and bread is always fresh as well as the meats. My girlfriend orders the Lox bagel, very delicious. I usually get the buffalo chicken sandwich on a sub bun. So good, my mouth is watery just thinking about it. The service is good, fast and efficient. If you decide to stop in early, always expect a line. But again, service is so fast that what would seem like a 20 minute wait is nothing more than 4 minutes total. The area around there is so nice as well, the foothills create a scenic view and a great place to walk or jog and burn off those carbs. It's always a good stop if you want to go out for breakfast or lunch. Prices are not bad either. Especially for the quality in taste. 4 stars for sure!

Came in to find some table runners, but found none. We did find a gazebo that we like and may possibly get tomorrow. By we I mean me and my girlfriend. This super target is pretty cool. They also have a grocery side like the walmarts which is convenient as we don't have much food markets around here. We are definitely going back to purchase that gazebo. Stay tuned for pictures!

I've been here at last 5 times. My first 2 visits I gave it 3 stars. But the last 3 visits I had to take one away. I ordered pork fried rice, and it tasted burnt. Each and every time out of the last 3 times it tasted this way. Was not happy. I also get the orange chicken and Mongolian beef. And again I was disappointed. The quality and texture of the meats were not as they usually are. Not sure if it's getting too expensive for them to order and cook with high grade meats and spices. Quality has definitely dropped. I am not sure if I will ever try it again. Well at least not for a long while.

This place is a little dirty on the inside. I wouldn't get anything from here not even a water. Since the QT opened across the street, there really is no need to come here for gas or anything for that matter!

Once we tried El Gallo Blanco, we decided to try Otro, which is a sister restaurant. I thought the food was amazing. Tried their tacos, very tasty. Restaurant is small, not a long wait at all. Food was served right away. All in all, a great experience. I would definitely come back here.

Long John's is not like it used to be. The chicken and fish are not as tasty. The breading is very salty. Sometimes the chicken doesn't seem cooked all the way. I feel the staff doesn't really care about the food they serve. Customer service is terrible here. It's definitely changed a lot from when I was a kid. I used to love eating at Long Johns. It was a delicacy eating here back then. Now, it's more like a curse coming here. You hit yourself in the head thinking, " why did I even consider eating here?" Honestly, I wouldn't waste my time and money here.

This QT is very nice. Just recently opened. Conveniently located next to the $3 car wash. Gas is always the cheapest. Their food selection is great. Hot dogs, pizza, donuts, etc. very clean inside. They have tables and chairs outside so you can sit and enjoy your coffee and donuts or whatever food you buy. Air is free. Customer service is always exceptional here. Employees actually enjoy working here and ask how your day is. It's always good when you receive exceptional customer service. It's a great way to start your day, resume your day or end your day depending on the time you stop in. What more could you want from a gas station. Maybe free gas??? Not in this lifetime, but wishful thinking!!! I give QT five stars. Keep doing what you're doing people. And keep those gas prices lower than your competitors. " If you do it, they will come!"
