The place is always packed. I don't get it? I've been there twice in the last two months and both times have been less than impressive. Overpriced for the puny portion sizes. And salads are sliced iceberg with toms and cucs plopped on top.  At least the waitress was great.

The staff, service and food are AMAZING! The atmosphere is modern and no- frills nice. The seating is limited, be prepared to wait for a seat or take it to go if you hit during M-F lunch rush, but whatever you do, don't bail...this is a great dining experience. The spicy garlic beans are delectable!

I moved into my home in 2003. Over the years I have been through at least 6 pest control companies. Most of them made big promises but never delivered. Our area had a serious scorpion problem and although I know they are tought to deal with, I expect a company to tell me the truth. In other words, if you say you can control them, I darn well expect you to do that.  Everyone wants you to sign a contract. When I was approached a few years ago by Preventive, I told them flat out - if you guys can do what you promise, we will have a happy relationship, if not, not only will I end our relationship, but that contract of yours will be as worthless as tissue.   These guys have NOT let me down. Since they have been taking care of my home, I have had almost no pests in my home at all. My technician Trey is awesome, friendly, responsive, informative and professional. They are a pleasure to do business with. Totally!   Thank you Preventive for being a company of integrity!

I'm not sure if it's just this location or what, but both times I've visited it's been a bust. The menu has a ton of appetizing choices, but like your hottest romantic fantasies, it's better in your head. The food taste, presentation and preparation leaves a LOT to be desired.  It's gotta be tough to be a hostess, but if you can't even FAKE being friendly and act like you give a crap that someone showed up to spend their money in your place of employment, go work somewhere else.  Not so sure I see a lot of "good" in this "egg." You're better off with Village Inn up the street.

The first time I went, I thought maybe they just had an off day. I wasn't impressed.  It must have been a year between that first visit and the second. Well, it was during that second visit I remembered why in the hell I waited a year to return.  First of all, the service was less than average. I'm all for authentic Mexican food, but my server was so difficult to understand, and understand me, I was wondering if I actually had been transported south of the border.  It was NOT busy when we were there, but we were constantly looking for someone to help with the many issues we had during our meal.   They screwed up my kids burrito, (how tough is it to NOT serve it enchilada style).  My other son ordered beef tacos, he loves tacos, took one bite and was like YUCK! I said seriously, it can't be that bad, so I - being the dad who was raised not to waste food took a taste. - YUCK is right. How can you screw up ground beef? Well, I suppose if you can't serve a burrito plain, ground beef is way to tough to cook and season properly.  I ordered off the healthy menu and the piece of meat that came out on my plate would have made a nice treat for my Labrador, but not for me. Now maybe it was because I waited 5 minutes before trying my steak that caused it to suck so bad - but I was hoping to get my son a new meal, (which never happened btw) because by the time the waiter came back, my boy was so stuffed on chips and salsa, he didn't want anything else.  AND - the drinks were never refilled or topped off. AND - they didn't even offer to take the tacos off my bill. Hmmm. Customer satisfaction 101 me thinks???  All in all, I will NOT be going back here. El Palacio means the Palace...in my judgement, the King and Queen need to get their kingdom in order.

They were able to give me a great deal on four tires for my Benz. A lot better than dealership prices, and even kicked the crap out of Costco, Sam's Club and Discount Tire.  A few months after I purchased, I had a tire issue. They inspected, ordered a new tire and I was out the door the next day without a dime out of pocket. They are busy, but took great care of me on all accounts.

Not only was their prices better than what I found elsewhere for my kids "quad" battery, but they also installed two batteries in an electric scooter for me ON THE SPOT! One item I needed was out of stock, but the ordered it from another store and had it there the next day. The called me multiple times to let me know it was in. Very friendly and outstanding customer service. Thank You!

This is a nice cross between a "Garcia's sit down and a "Filiberto's" grab and go. They have an extensive menu selection, you may have a hard time deciding what to get. The salsa's and bean dips that come with the chips taste very fresh and unique. The wait staff we have both times were very attentive and pleasant. The only down side for me was my son ordered bean burro and the first bite made the bottom explode and squirted all the contents out. They were kind enough to make him a new one, which did the same thing. :) All in all, worth a visit. They even have fried ice cream, which is a plus with kids.

I've been a homeowner in the Chandler area since 1991. Over the years I have been through dozens  of pest control companies. In 2003, I moved to a new home near Ocotillo and McQueen. I soon discovered our area had a serious scorpion problem and although I know they are tough to deal with, I expect a company to tell me the truth. In other words, if you say you can control them, I darn well expect you to do that. Once again, I started the agonizing process of trying and being disappointing by pest control companies. Most of them made big promises but never delivered. Then one day, I was rushing out of my house just as two guys were walking up to pitch me on their pest control service. I asked them two questions: 1. Can you get rid of and control scorpions? 2. Do you agree that if you can't do what you promise, I shouldn't pay you or be obligated to a contract?  They said yes and yes. I tossed my credit card, told them to knock on my door and get the info from my wife cause I was late.  That was circa 2009 and I have never regretted that decision. Trey was my technician all those years. An amazing guy. Honest, friendly, goes above and beyond what is expected. He's a real good egg. Now that he has started his own business, I tell EVERYONE I can about him. I've told many of my neighbors about Trey and the smart ones have called him and joined the happy club of pest control paradise. The ones that don't use Trey have ALL had someone in their household bitten by scorpions. Hey, if you are happy with your pest control company, God bless you. It's hard to find, but if you want a guy you can trust, who delivers results and is as friendly and honest as they come, call Trey over at Guaranteed Pest Control. Your satisfaction is HIS Guarantee...and I can tell you with YEARS of personal experience, he never let me down, nor do i expect him too. i don't know how he can do such a great job. Trey has an inspired work ethic and perfectly tuned moral compass.

My regular carpet cleaner was booked and I needed to have one big room cleaned for a Holiday party on a short notice. (Our little dogs had made a BIG mess in there and the smell was disgusting). Randy not only juggled his schedule to come out the SAME day I called him, but he did an amazing job. He really went above and beyond what I expected and truly saved the day.  My carpet looks great and it really feels and smells clean and like new. I highly recommend him. Courteous, neat, professional and he knows his stuff. Thanks Randy!
