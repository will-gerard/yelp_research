Overweight, asthma and bad back...I have been going to this studio for a little over a year. If I can do Bikram Yoga most anyone can. The heat is hard to get used to in the beginning but the heat makes it possible to stretch beyond what I thought was possible. The proprietor and her staff have created an atmosphere where everyone should feel welcome no matter what your body type or physical ability. The studio is constantly being renovated and upgraded. The recent replacement of the ceiling and the addition of ozone machine shows the management's commitment to the yogi students. I give 5 stars. Namaste!

Giligan's is a fun unpretentious bar. Chuey and Bret are awesome. Capt. Mike is always updating the decor and events. Food is awesome bar fare at great prices. Two middle fingers up!

This place rocks! The value is incredible. Big portions - just what one should expect from a family owned neighborhood Italian restaurant. The pizza is new york style, the turkey sub has generous portions but the veal parmesan is out of this world good. The owners are usually there and they recently moved to a more vibrant location.

I would give 5 stars but Ye!p filters out the good comments automatically. Ye!p likes negative but this salon deserves the best praise.  This nail salon is the bomb diggedy!  I have been to this nail salon twice. Great experience both times. This salon will be a problem if you are a person that complains. The service was more than what I expected.   The owner made sure to greet me by name and check in on me during my time with the technician. I have no complaints and cannot see why I would stay away from their shop. Namaste!

The food is always great at both Popo's locations. I have been a fan for over 35 years. The restaurant has never been known for great or even mediocre service. Our server tonight must have been the reigning Arizona Hide-N-Seek Champion. We could not find him to save our life. Good luck in the regional qualifier against Big Foot.
