When I want to go Greek I go to Athenian Express!!!!! This place is totes amazeballs. I love everything from the hummus to the falafel...they have patio seating so I prefer to go to the restaurant and sit outside. Very CA casual and peaceful. Def make a point to visit.

The bartender here had my ROFL all night. (FYI I was the DD so no alcohol induced hilarity) the live band was fun and talented guys who played crowd pleasers. Totally a cave creek road dive bar but the place is relaxed and not über pretentious. I would go back.

The food here is delicious. We frequent order from an office building next door. The score is low because the delivery is SLOW. The charge for delivery is $4.00 and it takes sometimes an hour to show up. Please take note managers...your delivery sucks...good thing the food is so good :-) it almost makes up for it.

I have never ever heard of this place until two days ago. After a google search and menu perusal I got excited!! Went to dinner tonight and I was not disappointed in the slightest. The restaurant is basic; meaning the focus is on the food not the decor. It's actually refreshing to be in such a laid back casual atmosphere. It allows the food to shine. Bathrooms were spotless which is +++ in my boom. Jerk chicken is totes amazeballs also the Cuban beans. Next time I go I am going to try the veggie quesadilla. I saw that being served at the next table and it gave me entree envy. So just GO!!

I was in the mood to go to a place I had not been to before. Desert Ridge has various restaurant from fast casual to fine dining. Yard House seemed like the best fit for my companion and I. First observation was how efficient everything was running. Wait staff, kitchen...appeared to be moving along and they were busy! Our server was attentive without cloying, witty without ingratiating, and down to earth. We greatly appreciated her and that improved the experience overall. The Apple Cider brined pork chop was divine, as was the roasted veg. My Cobb salad with skirt steak was also delicious minus the skirt steak. *disclaimer* I am not a meat eater so this is not unusual for me. I didn't really want any kind of meat so it would not have mattered, nothing YH could have done. It wasn't you (YH), it's me. Make sure you have dessert!! The trio of Mimi's allows you to taste and enjoy without going over the line. The apple cobbler is the bomb.com.gov.org.net. Second is the chocolate soufflé...ohhh so happy with the soufflé. Anyway, YH is a large chain and I like their product-good work guys! We will be back.

Fantastic. Did not disappoint. I have never ever ever had a bad meal here. My personal favorite is the mahi mahi sandwich. They just do it right and it's not easy getting good fish in Arizona.

Hmmmm I have been hesitating to write this review because I want to like this restaurant. I want to like it so much. I just love having a dining option that has ingredients that I recognize. I have eaten here three times. Each time my food has tasted completely different. I ordered the Singapore orange rice bowl twice. The very first time I got it the tofu was cooked perfectly but the vegetables were horrifically overcooked and were the same quality as the generic frozen vegetables I can get at my local Fry's.... The second time I ate there I had the Wendy's pickle. The sandwich was not disappointing per se but the mock chicken patty was too big. I don't know how to explain precisely what it felt like biting into it. If Green is trying to re-create a chicken patty using texturized soy protein etc. etc. then they're missing the part where the patty needs to not be large... This sandwich would've been perfect if the patty had been exactly half the size it is. The second time I ate the Singapore orange dish (which would've been my third visit to green) the sauce was so salty-the sauce tasted like they had made the sauce out of soy sauce than reduced it and then added more soy sauce and then salted it. The tofu was perfectly cooked again and this time the vegetables appeared to be fresh vegetables and they were cooked perfectly crisp tender. Had I not had the sauce the dish would've been perfect. I really like the idea of this of this restaurant however when you look at the menu and compare what's on the menu to the food there is a distinct discrepancy. Either the owner isn't being honest or the general manager can't keep a consistent staff in the kitchen. Until something changes I will just take my business elsewhere or make my own version of Singapore Orange at my house.

Just tried this place today for the first time...the shop is super cute and would be a comfortable place to sit and eat and relax. The food is the BOMB. I am a big fan of sandwiches and this place did not disappoint. I ordered the Mediterranean original size and added mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, red onion, and Italian seasoning. It was toasty and delicious!! They do deliver however I am unsure of the times and area. The price is decent-to be expected. They have a lot of competition as this corner is crammed with choices. If you are in the mood for a good sub go to Potbelly!!

ATTENTION TOURISTS:  This is not a restaurant. This place is a bar. Do NOT go here for Mexican style food...Go here for beer, margaritas, and tequila...maybe the nachos??? Only saw them--neighboring table ordered them. We should have gone to the Yard House. Their menu is dishonest and embarrassing. If you want real and authentic (or Americanized but delicious) Mexican food-go to Los Dos Molinas, America's Taco Shop, Macayos, Aunt Chiladas, La Paloma...anywhere but here. Phoenix/Glendale-we have SOOO many places...Yelp that shit--wish I had
