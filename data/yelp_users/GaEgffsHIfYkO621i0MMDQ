Literally the nicest, most sincere, excited employees I have seen working at a fast-food establishment. Never had a problem with the food or drinks. The rest of it is an average Taco Bell, but every single time I go, even through the drive-thru for a quick drink, the employees are the nicest people ever.

AWESOME.   And sometimes when it's really busy, they take you to magical rooms of the building that you don't even know exist for extra seating.   But really everything is good here.

This place is really cute and unique and definitely feels like an old-timey soda fountain.  I love the antique thrift store that is attached to it and the decorations and the fancy little bar.  The staff is a little iffy sometimes, some of the staff is nice and excited, other times they are half dead.   The food is good, a little simple for my taste and price range, but my boyfriend loves it. The potato salad is great. He likes the food (but he likes simple stuff like sandwiches and hot dogs), but his favorite is definitely the soda.  They have a HUGE menu of different types of drinks.   Very nice place to have a treat, but if you're going to get just one thing, definitely get a dessert rather than a meal. Their sundaes are huge, too! So good!

Came here to get something fixed that was broken at another location and was very pleased with the customer service here.   Got a call to correct my issue promptly and was very accommodating even though I was out of town and called back to have my car looked at a week later.   Came in as a walk-in with a few minutes notice and was able to get my problem fixed in like 15 minutes.   No questions asked.   Thanks for all your help!

Love, love, love this place.   Their pizzas are amazing! They offer gluten-free, which is nice, and they have tons of other menu options, too.   Personally, I want to do their meal challenge where you have to eat one of their GIANT pizzas in a certain amount of time, but I'm trying to keep my svelte figure...by eating only slightly unhealthy amounts of pizza.   Because I eat a lot of Venezia's...a lot.

DELICIOUS FOOD.  Don't go here if you're expecting a beautiful establishment- it's on the corner, has no inside restaurant, is cash only, has a covered patio thing to eat in and a window where you pick up your food...BUT IT IS SO GOOD.  The portions are great, it is very affordable, they have a lot of different options.  Definitely a gem of a hole-in-the-wall and I am so glad I found it!

I had to come here because they were the only place readily available that had the tires I needed..  The lobby was dirty and there were dead beetles all over the floor and on the chair rail on the wall..but oh well.   They had to ask me how to open up my trunk to get something from inside because they didn't know how to open it (true, it's tough). A few days later, I looked in my car and apparently they pushed through the trunk button on the inside while trying to get it to work...and they didn't tell me, so now I'm stuck with a broken button.   And I don't even live in that part of the Valley to get it fixed.  So that's pretty shady and not cool.

As much as I didn't enjoy my experience with this location, the customer service through the chain is great---  I noticed the beetles as an extraneous thing, but the company owner got back to me very quickly on Yelp and said they sprayed for pests to fix that issue.   The owner ALSO got back to me and said I could go to a location near me to get my button fixed and I received a call quickly.   Also, someone from this location followed up with a phone call after my original review, but unfortunately I am not near that location to try them again.   Either way---I was contacted by someone from a closer location and got my button fixed without an appointment in like 15 minutes. Super easy. Thanks for the good customer service. I still like this auto chain and will continue to go:)

Good food but service is iffy. Four of us ate dinner (including rice and chicken breast) without silverware and they said they were "looking for more" and finally brought it when we were a few bites done from being finished. Didn't really say sorry or offer discounts or anything. Pretty lame. But we did learn to eat rice with a skewer broken in half.

Never got an explanation on what happened, but they said sorry and sent us a gift card to make up for it!

I'm not a seasoned Indian food connoisseur, but this place is great.   It's simple and the owners are very nice.   I've had great buffet food both times I have been there (once with a groupon).   The shopping center kind of reminds me of a place where I might get mugged/kidnapped, but whatever.

Very good pizza- very small portions, but that is somewhat expected in this type of place.  The location and atmosphere is my favorite part, I think. It's in such a cute, vintage little building with a lovely park and center surrounding it. The outdoor seating and indoor seating are both comfortable, though inside it is a little cramped.   I love the white pizzas ( I can't remember the name, but it doesn't have traditional marinara-type sauce) and they have great salads, too.  They are pricey- if I remember about $16-20 per person, and I didn't get full.  BUT it is a great experience and everyone should at least TRY it. Cute for a quiet date night or lunch treat.

Great valet, great friendly employees.  Very sunny, happy place to have lunch. Even on a week day it was busy. The staff was very attentive and made the trip very quick and easy.  Great food. Great chips and guacamole, and swordfish tacos!

Very nice store, but I ran into a bad employee that will make me never go back to this location and they didn't get any of my business, nor will they ever.   I walked into the store and was looking at specialty sodas with my boyfriend. I cannot eat sugar, so I was looking for diet sodas while he was looking at what he wanted to buy.   An employee came up to me and said in an EXTREMELY condescending manner, "are you finding your soda OK?"   He was not asking sincerely if I wanted help, nor did he even stop to help me if I needed help. It sounded as if he was mocking the fact that I was looking at non-alcoholic sodas rather than hard liquors.   You sir, were a complete jerk to customers with no reason. I would have purchased from this store, as well as purchased more expensive items from the store, but his lack of concern for the customer was unbelievable.   I can definitely take a joke and have a sense of humor myself, but there is no reason to mock a customer and not offer any support, help or offer other products I may be interested in.

Went here last week for dinner. We frequent the 44th and Indian School location and have been to another location in the west Valley. LOVE their food.   But this location was probably one of the dirtiest restaurants I have ever been to or I can remember going to. Trash everywhere, spilled food all over the floors, dirty tables...I'm honestly not very picky and understand being busy, messy customers, etc.   But I was preoccupied with thinking about how dirty everything else might have been the whole time I was eating.   There were two or three other people in there, so it wasn't like they were swamped.   Food wasn't great either. I won't be coming back.

Great food, great service, really friendly staff. We had to wait a bit but as expected for a Saturday afternoon.  Very accommodating and very friendly environment. Definitely has the same quality as the downtown Phoenix location!

Good prices, good customer service, very comfortable and beautifully decorated. Everyone is friendly and professional. This place is modern and a little hard to see from the street, but worth giving a try.   I came here to get balayage from Taylor and she did a great job. No pressure to come back right away or do crazy things, but good recommendations and great work. I'm back now for my recommended cut and maintenance about 6-7 weeks after my first appointment and so far so good!   Easy for me to get an appointment a week or two out. No complaints so far :)  Definitely recommend!

So far I am extremely impressed by how punctual and helpful Watts is! We just signed a lease on a new apartment and were SHOCKED by some roaches, especially since we never had ANY issue with our previous apartment.   We called Watts on a Sunday and they said they would come out on Monday, which is also Memorial Day, and gave us a 4-hour window to come out.   I don't know how the service holds up, but will edit or repost when we find out. We are just really impressed so far by the attentiveness and willingness to fix our (hopefully one-time-only) problem.

I personally did not do a float but I accompanied two others that did.   They loved the experience, but I can't judge on the float itself, just the atmosphere.   The spa itself is very clean and clear and welcoming. It has a nice fishtank, nice minimalist furnishings, is very "zen" and looks nice. They have a great oxygen bar/lounge room, a room for introducing their video and what float spas are, etc. The float rooms are very professional- towel/clothes racks, showers, tiles, safety pool "rugs," etc. They even have a little vanity room to freshen up after you do your float.   Steven helped us for the most part and he was extremely helpful and very nice. He is a great person to be helped by and work there. They charge for their chi machine (little massager/spine-moving thing in their community den where they do meditations, events, movies, etc) but he allowed me to use it and take advantage of the den while I was waiting for the two floaters I was with.   They even gave us little epsom salt gift bags, event calendar and more info.   Overall, great place.   Steven was EXCELLENT and made me feel like I should try floating next time, but didn't force it down my throat, ya know? I have anxiety and claustrophobia which is why I didn't try it with the others I was with, but he let me know different options for people like me. :)  Will definitely go back, recommend and hopefully try myself one day!

I decided to come here after reading a few not-so-great reviews because it was close to me and more convenient than driving anywhere else.  When I got there, there was a line of people waiting for services, many chairs open and only about 2-3 nail techs working. I was not greeted when I walked in and sat down. A few minutes later, one of the techs told me they didn't have time and to come back in an hour. It was awkward, but I came back because my day was completely free.  When I came back, the nail tech wasn't very friendly and didn't say much, but did a good job on acrylic nails.   I went back to get them re-done about a month or so later just to see if the unfriendliness was a fluke (they did do decent nails), and right when I walked in the door she said they were too busy and told me to make an appointment for another day. I needed my nails done that day...not later. So I walked out and the lady was yelling after me. Very unprofessional.  I drove somewhere else out of my way and have never gone back since. Just because it is closer, does not mean it is better! This is one of the worst salons customer-service wise that I have ever been to.

I've literally eaten here 4 times this week.  It's a little expensive, ($22 for 5 enchiladas, an egg and two drinks), which is why I am stuck on giving it less than 5 stars. But otherwise, I think it could be worth the money considering how unique and customizable it is. I don't know, I just want everything to be free, so I'm at like 4.5 stars on this one...  Anyway, the food tastes great. Really unique, authentic options. I really recommend the red sauce, corn tortillas, pork, chicken, an over-medium egg, slaw, jalapeno ranch and cotija cheese...that's what I ALWAYS get. They have really good chips and salsa, too.  The staff is friendly. My only complaint is that there are SO many options, that I think they could benefit from having labels on the glass telling you what everything is, that way you don't have to stare straight up and get lost on the menu and waste their time, but they do a good job of explaining it anyway. Still, I like doing things myself instead of asking the same dumb question every time.   They serve in their own little wood-fired ceramic bowls which is cute and unique, too.  They said they don't like hearing "this is kinda like Chipotle!" so I will say this place is better than Chipotle, but very similar :)  They serve enchiladas, chopped salads, stuffed poblano peppers and have other specials.   Take all of my money, Gadzooks. You are so yummy.

This was the first time I went here and I was very impressed.   I got a pedicure and acrylics fill and I had two men (Kent-nails and John-pedi) who did a great job. Kent actually did my hands while I was sitting in the pedicure getting my feet done, so it was pretty cool...I've never had that before!   They did a good job with both pedi and nails and definitely took care with them.   The inside of the salon is very nice and simple.  While I was there it was slow (Monday after noon) but they had a few customers. One woman came in to get something fixed, but she didn't have time to wait for the two of us already getting services, so she left and made an appt for the next day. They called her back a few minutes later and said they were finished and were able to get her in--very personalized help!  Another woman was getting July 4th nails with designs and they seemed to be doing a great job with those.   Apparently they have 'Happy Hour' pricing, which I wasn't aware of and didn't make an appointment, but it's a cool addition for sure.   Will definitely be back!

This place is great and I'm so glad I found it so soon!! The employees are so friendly and happy and willing to help and serve you. I am gluten-free, so when I asked for the gf crust, the lady actually asked if I wanted her to change her gloves for my allergy...that type of competence and willingness is RARE.   It's only 7.99 for a make your own 11 inch pizza, which if you only get one topping is ok, but it's for unlimited toppings. So in theory you could get like all the veggies, all the seasonings, all the specialty meats and everything for only 8$...which is awesome.  The flavors are great and it's a little more unique than other places (they have cool flavors and jerk seasonings and tangy seasonings, etc)  I will definitely be returning and can't wait to return.   It's really rare to find places that actually offer and honor and want to serve gluten free customers.   THANK YOU!!  Give it a try and get lots of toppings so you get more for your money :).   Update: went back the next day- still great!

The employees/personalities leave much to be desired, but this food is great.   Reminds me a little of El Norteno in Downtown Phoenix...  A good, quick hole in the wall in a random dead shopping center. Been here a few times and always good!
