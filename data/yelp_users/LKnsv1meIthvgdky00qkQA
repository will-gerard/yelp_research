A great garage with a great owner.  George goes above and beyond to provide quality service, fair prices, and detailed explanations of what's wrong with your car.  A recent experience demonstrates the honesty of this shop.  I had some engine lights turn on and auto zone ran a diagnostic that suggested some larger problems but after taking the car to George I found out that it turned out to just be a dying battery.  There is no other place in town I'll take my vehicles.

From the outside not much to look at but inside, that's a different story.  I shared the Spicy Fried Rice, Pad Thai, and Hot Curry Catfish.  All were excellent with great flavor!  The Spicy Rice was cooked with lots of fresh veggies and not too over powering.  The Pad Thai is legit as all the other reviews say and the Catfish Curry was a nice discovery. The jalape√±os definitely up the heat factor and overall its a great dish.

This is a great little chinese joint that delivers and which has saved me many times as I've been hungover on the couch too tired to move.  The Egg Foo Yung is tasty with a great brown gravy.  The Beef Lo Mein is a great dish as well as the Chicken Fried Rice.  They usually make it pretty quick to the house and are

Now I remember why I stopped coming here.  It takes FOREVER to get your food.  I realize it's a small kitchen with one guy back there but for 3 orders (2 ahead of me) it shouldn't take 25 mins.  Foods decent but I'll head to Frederico's on Cave Creek any day over this place.

This is a great barber shop where I never have to wait long to get a haircut and everyone on the staff gives a great cut.  Hard to find these days.

I wish I could give this place 6 stars.  By far the best chinese food in Phoenix in my opinion and the staff is super friendly.  I love finding local places like this instead of the souless PF Changs and Pei-Weis.  The candied banana won-tons are the best!

Pizza is good and you can't beat the beer selection.   Theirs wings have a good sauce also.

I'm a Walgreen's fan myself but this CVS is decent.  I like that they have a minute clinic in it.  I've gone there before when I couldn't get into my doctor's office in a timely fashion.  I've only used the actual pharmacy once and they were fairly fast.  The staff up front here is pretty nice too.

Course is 5 stars but fairways are really tight and you need to know where they open up on some holes.   Pace of play is 1 star.  Have never played this course in anything respectable summer or winter.   Condition is 5 stars.  Very well maintained.    Club house is 5 stars.  One of the nicer ones around for sure.    Price is 1 star in the winter.  Ridiculously overpriced in peak season but hey it's not for the locals at that point.  Summer is 5 stars as I played it for $50 the other day.

Review is only for the range.  I've never played the executive course.  Great place to practice.  It's cheap, grass on the range is decent, and I love their chipping area.  4 flags and plenty of area to creat different distances and shots.  Balls are a little flat but that doesn't bother me.

As far as a Quizno's goes this one is clean and the owner is very friendly.  I'm in here a lot since it's close to work and enjoy the food.  Gets busy around noon but the line moves pretty fast

Best public course in Phoenix in my opinion!   Every hole is picturesque and feels like what desert golf should be: penalties for missing but not so narrow that you have to hit an iron off every tee.  The elevation changes make the course a joy to play and has been in great shape every time I've played it.   The only annoyance is the drive in the cart from the club house to the first tee.  Cool factor for having a gold simulator in the bar now!!!

My friends raved about this place and finally took me recently and I could not have been more disappointed.  The service was horrendous and slow.  I could have walked to either China or Mexico before I got my food.  The Diablo Chicken was dry and uninspired and the rice and beans were medicore at best.  Not sure what all the fan fare is about this place but I'll never go back.

Hana sushi is a great North Phoenix sushi bar.  The restaurant itself is pretty small and not much to look at but the food is top notch from my experience there.  I ordered the Salmon and Hamachi Toro Nigiri and both were very tasty with quality rish.  The Hamachi sashimi I had provided good portions and was very good also.  My girlfriend got the Hamachi cooked cheek.  I think it was Hamacha hama but I'm not sure.  It was cooked very nice with a savory terikaki sauce.  The food was extremely reasonable considering some of the places I've been around town.  Overall it was a great experience and I'll be back for sure.

The course is actually fun to play in the Summer but not worth the price in the winter.  Pace of play in the winter is somewhere along the rate of reading and finishing a George R.R. Martin book also!  The 1 star rating is for their refusal to allow non-guests to pay to use their driving range.  Really?!  Who do you think supports this joint in the Summer!!!

I love Costco and especially this one.  Great staff, close to my house, and always clean.  Their wine selection is good.  Food options are always expansive.  Can't beat this place.

You get what you pay for here.  Executive course with a few par 4s.  Really just a good place to practice the irons.  Course is usually in mid to poor shape.  Only practice at this place because it's a block from the house.

Catch 22 is a great neighborhood bar to watch a game at or just to enjoy a cold one.  The food is pretty good for bar food.  I like the Chicken Philly, Prime Dip Sandwich, and Rodger Clemens burger.  I love the fact they have poker Sunday through Wednesday and sometimes have some decent bands there also.

Considering it is in the same complex as a bowling alley I wasn't expecting much when I walked into this place.  Thankfully I was pleasantly pleased with the food. The albacore and salmon nigiri were quite good.  The staff was very nice so I'm a little confused by some of the reviews   My only complaint was the hamachi sashimi was a bit on the small side but the quality was excellent.  All in all I'll be back, especially since it's close to the house.

A really cool concept with sushi on a conveyer belt for rock bottom prices.  The quality of fish is decent with a good variety of nigiri and rolls.  I was a fan of their yellowtail and spicy tuna topped with tuna and my girlfriend swears by the Haru Poppers  I'll be back as often as I'm down on this side of town for sure considering our party of four ate for $40!  I spend that on myself alone at a Sushi Brokers or Kabuki.  Different quality of fish for sure but still a great bargain with good tastes.

The Fried Pickles and Chili Cheese Fries were amazing and my burger was great.  I would totally recommend this place to a friend.

My girlfriend and I walked into this pub after Zips was packed on a Sunday afternoon.  We were starving and didn't want to drive anywhere else so we figured we'd try Clancy's.  This was our first mistake.  Strip mall bar is complement for this dump.  The projector TV on the wall was faded, barely visible, and of course the one TV with the Cardinals game on was back under it's dingy bar so it was barely visible.    Food:  We ordered the Hot Wings, Pepper Jack Burger, and for an appetizer Chips, Salsa, and Guacamole.  All of these bar munchies are basically impossible to screw up by anyone not drooling on themselves or riding a short bus yet this place managed to ruin all three.  The wings seemed like they were microwaved and barely had any sauce on them.  The burger showed up with meat, cheese, and a bun.  I was graciously provided rubbery pickles but apparently lettuce and tomato aren't grown in this section of Scottsdale as they were noticably missing.  But lets get to the best part...the guacamole.  To say this stuff was brown and disgusting would be an insult to the Coach Purses and Skin of the Scottdale women everywhere.  This wasn't just a dusting of top that could be scraped off but was through and through this deliciously looking turd treat.     Needless to say I'll never return to this culinary hell hole unless I lose a bet that will benefit special need puppies.

I wanted to love this place so bad considering I've lived in Venezuela and hadn't tasted some of this country's food in over 17 years.  However it pains me to write that I was pretty disappointed.  The server, who is assume owned the restaurant, is a very nice guy but forgot my stepson's food and didn't realize until 15 mins after he dropped off our food.  My cachapa was burnt and dripping with butter.  Don't get me wrong, cachapas usually are rockin with butter but this was oozing everywhere.  The arepa was pretty decent and the only saving light of the meal but overall this experience left me wanting more.

This place is amazing.  The cochinita pubil and chicken mole tacos were unforgettable and the salsa bar alone is worth the trip.  The salsa cilantro was a great choice.  I'll be telling all my friends about my new favorite taco stop

This Circle K is right in my area and a great place to fill up.  Usually don't have to wait as they have plenty of pumps.  Circle K really has a good beer selection in their walk in cooler also which is also a plus.

I really like the new Vig.  Mondays are a great day to check it out as it's $5 burger day and the Vigazz burger with an egg on top is amazing!  Can't beat the indoor Bocci Ball court.  Free valet is nice also considering the continued the Vig tradition of barely any parking.  I'll definitely be headed back

Saw Zaytoon driving home one day and put it on the list of things to try.  My only regret is I didn't try this place sooner!  I had the Lamb Kabob Wrap and my girlfriend had the Beef Kabob plate.  The lamb was cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and complimented by the fresh cucumber sauce.  The rice that came with the Beef plate was fragrent and fresh.  Much better than the crunchy crappy rice I've recieved at similar joints around the valley.    The owner was probably the most polite person I've met working at a restaurant.  You could really tell he loved what he was doing and it shows in his food and business.

Vista Verde is one of my favorite courses.  Although it's a hefty trek, even from North Phoenix, it's well worth the drive.  The course is always in great shape and pace of play seems to be above average.  The clubhouse was just finished which is nice.  The course is tough but fair.  Recommended for anyone with a 20 handicap or less in my opinion.

My favorite breakfast joynt by far in North Pheonix.  I love the chorizo and eggs, but the meatlovers omlet, and pancakes are also some of the best I've had at any restaurant.  Ask for a side of the ancho chili sauce and pair it with the potatos or your omlet.  You won't be disappointed.  They have lunch and just recently added dinner so I'm stoked to try those soon.

Lenero Mexican Grill is one of my favorite restaurants. The Palo de Lena Al Fuego is an amazing grilled steak with a combo of grilled veggies and roasted red potatoes, always seasoned and smoked to perfection.  The Barbacao is another dish I always go for as the lamb, smokey charro beans, and tortillas are a great trio.  Add their warm salsa and its a solid taco.  The chips yes are not that great but really when was the last time you said, "you know who's chips I'm really in the mood for...let's go to ____."  Give me a break; I swear some yelpers look for anything to complain about.  Most authentic Mexican in the area hands down.

I love their beer selection.  Really haven't found one I dislike.  Had the French Dip sandwhich which was good but a tad on the small side.  Wife had the Salmon with spinach and loved it.  Service was just ok, took a while to get our food but came just at the beginning of the dinner rush so not too unexpected.  Will definitely return to try their whole selection of beers on tap.

This is the old Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville at Westgate.  I had the sea bass tacos and the meat was rubbery, cool, and bland.  Like some of the other reviews have said if you want a margarita or a beer go for it but if you are looking for Mexican food, this is not the place you want to go to.  Bleh.....
