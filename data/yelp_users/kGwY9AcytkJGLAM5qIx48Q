I've been here three times, the food is okay.  The prices are good and the customer service is okay.  If you want a quick, Vietnamese dish such as Pho, give it a try, the prices can't be beat.  One thing that disturbed me as I noticed on my last visit, the owner dumping the remaining customer's water into the money plant that sits in the front when you walk in.  It kind of grossed me out.  As you know our mouths breed bacteria, and it's being mixed and cultivated in that money tree plat.  Yuck!  For that reason alone, I may not come back.

I feel like they've improved the quality of the food.  I'm happy with the online ordering feature through, Yelp; however, I think there should be an option to order drinks, say if you want a fountain drink or something.

I get my car washed here off and on; however, I've noticed the past several washes, they do not lift my floor mats and vacuum under them, which really irritates me.  If I continue to go here, I'm only going to tip $2 instead of the 20% I used to tip.  I've also tried the express wash with the towel dry which runs about $8.99 with freshener and they don't dry your vehicle very good.  When they finish they stand at your window looking at you waiting for a tip.  I won't be tipping on this service any longer.   When I got my car washed a few days ago with the exterior towel dry, I decided to get out of the car when they were finished to look at their work.  They didn't dry my front or back bumper.  The Carwasher, train your people to provide better customer service.    Also several years ago, my mom got her car washed here, and the guy who drove it out of the wash ran into the back of the vehicle he parked it behind.  Luckily there was no damage but they acted as if it was not their fault when the manager came out.  I would have posted that review on Yelp, but Yelp wasn't around at that time.

I love going to this MAC store for the full make-up with a $50.00 product purchase.  The artists are amazing and do a very professional and detailed job.  I've done this several times at this store for various events that I attend through out the year, and Effie, (that's her name) usually does my make-up.  She is amazing and the highlighting and contouring she does looks perfect.    If I could afford to do this every day, I would.  Go to MAC for full-make up with the product purchase, you won't regret it.  If you're going to do the full make-up, I would highly recommend purchasing a set of their eyelashes with your product purchase, because the lashes really complete the overall look. :)  Thank you, Effie, for the beautiful make-up I received yesterday.

This place is great!  Yesterday was my second visit at Community Tire Pros, as I had to have an A16 service done on my Acura MDX as well a rear brake pads.  Of course when this notification popped up on my dashboard stating the A16 service due NOW, I was worried.  I saw dollar signs and my bank account dwindling.  First off, I researched an A16 service and it costs about $200-$300 at the Acura dealership.  I expressed my concerns to Lorenzo who greeted me at the front desk and Lorenzo assured me I would be taken care of.  Lorenzo offered me a company car as he stated the service including brake pads may take over an hour.  Awesome, right?  I don't think I've ever been offered this.  I declined as I worked on my iPad in their waiting area on their free WiFi, because their waiting area has very comfy chairs, complimentary coffee, and a HDTV.    As a woman, I'm not very impressed with most body shops or vehicle repair places, but the waiting area is worth waiting in.  I do also want to note that this location if female friendly complimentary products in the bathroom that specifically cater to women's needs if you know what I mean. :P  I waited over an hour as stated and my total bill including an A16 service, rear brake pads and rear rotors were barely over $300.  Considering how much "luxury" vehicles are to maintain, I consider this a bargain.  I have family in the car business and since discovering Community Tire Pros through the recommendation of a friend, I no longer take my car to the family.  I am now a loyal customer of this place and totally trust them.    Thank you, Lorenzo, with Community Tire Pros for helping me out today, I greatly appreciate the service an honesty.

Worst customer service I have experience yet at post office.  Last week I walked into this post office to return a piece of clothing that I ordered online...  I waited in line for only a minute or so, and when it was my turn, I walked up to the counter where a OLD guy with white hair and white facial hair greeted me.  I handed him my bag, which was not taped, because I don't own clear, Scotch packaging tape, and he directed me to a retail rack and told me I could buy some tape to tape my package.  First of all, I've returned many things in boxes or bags w/o tape and most clerks at the post office will assist you and tape it up.  I noticed he had SEVERAL rolls or tape at his desk and one roll of CLEAR Scotch packaging tape.  I pointed at the roll behind his desk, and I said, you have some tape right there, can you help me out?  His exact words were, "that is not for customer use".    To the old man with white hair behind the counter, F.U. you are a d&#k!  I ended up going to a different Postal Office and the clerk there, gladly helped me out with my package.

I love this place.  I usually order from here once or twice a week.  I'm a Pho addict and my boyfriend loves the sesame chicken.  We often dine in too as the decor and decorations are interesting.  It's a very comfy and intimate feeling dining in and/or on their patio in the cooler months.  I've eaten a lot of Pho from other restaurants around the valley and Tottie's is in my top two! :)

I have been a customer of Buzzberry for a couple years.  I loved this place once.  I'm very irritated with them.  I loved the concept, and I love that they are dog friendly, but the place is depressing and dark inside.  The walls are painted a weird green and the furniture is horrible.  I'm irritated the food, it's never consistent.  The raw bar has been changed three times.  I used to love the moist raw bar a year ago, they changed it by adding oatmeal, making it dry, now, they took out the dark chocolate they once had in it.  I'm pissed.  I just spent over $4.00 on a pathetic raw bar that has NO flavor.    It's also unusual to me that Buzzberry doesn't sell Coke or Pepsi products, not even in  a can.  It seems to me that it would be a wise investment for them to have a soda fountain since the markup is so high on soda -- and again, not even cans or bottles of  Coke or Pepsi products.  I'm done with this place and their expensive food  Grrrrrrrrrr, Buzzberry.

Bill is the bomb!  I've been using Bill with Pop-A-Lock for years to rekey properties.  I'm in the real estate business and Bill provides a flat-rate for realtors.  He always provides great customer service, super fast response and turn-around, plus he is always the best priced.    Great guy and ethical!

I had a great experience with Amy Lorraine!  She was super fun and wealth of information for someone who had only been working there a week.  I highly recommend seeing Amy Lorraine if you're interested in owning a Jeep, Dodge or Chrysler vehicle.

I can't say enough good things about Dr. Dom and Dr. Matt.  I started going here after a car accident in which my car was totaled and the airbag deployed...  When I walked in the first day, it hurt to even sit in a chair or drive my rental car.  A couple times I was in tears in Dr. Dom's office and he was so compassionate and understanding to my situation.  I don't think I will ever consider going to another Chiropractor again after receiving treatment from Dr. Dom and Dr. Matt.  Not only are the doctors wonderful here but the staff is just as amazing.  Dr. Dom and his staff also provide trigger point classes, massage therapy and CPR classes and physical therapy.  I highly, highly recommend AH&W.

It took years before good ownership took over this place.  I have seen the name change at least half a dozen times in the past decade and two or three times in the matter of a month a few years back.  They finally have their isht together here.  If you want a koosh experience this IS NOT the gym for you.  Here you will see a variety of skill levels all trying to improve on their health.  Anyone from a beginner to national renowned body builders.  It's a REAL gym and the cheaper membership price is great too.   I saw comments about the staff not being pleasant, my experience has been good with the staff overall!

Justin and his crew were great!  They cleaned my 1800 SF home, cleaned the grout downstairs, and cleaned carpets upstairs.  I came home briefly for lunch while they were there and one of his crew members were actually cleaning my patio which as Saltilo tile.  I didn't even request that service but I was greatly appreciative, because it needed a pick-me-up.  Thank you!

I purchased a Groupon for CrossFit DTP, and I'm glad I did!!!  I've been in and out of the CrossFit community for a few years now, and I have to say that CrossFit is a way-of-exercise for me.  What I really like about CrossFit DTP is how friendly all the other people in class are.  It's a competitive environment but in a very supportive and encouraging way.  I've finished my 3rd group class at CrossFit DTP, and I feel I've already made some new friends.  The exercises are challenging but they won't kill you!  The coaching is great as I feel the emphasis is focused mostly on form and technique.  What I like about this particular CrossFit IS the attention to detail the coaching pays to every student in class.  CrossFit as we know has received a lot of negative attention in the press due to injury; however, I feel DTP's programming is structured to negate injury prone exercises.  I would highly recommend this box to the new student looking to try CrossFit or to a seasoned CrossFitter who just wants a great place to call home.  -Lindsey

Today was my first visit to the Gladly and I must say I was very impressed and happy that there is such a great gem is in our backyard.  The service was fantastic as we were a part of a group who listened to real estate professionals speak about taxes and write offs.  The gladly was so accommodating to this and were still very on top of our orders for food and drinks.  The room they put us in was perfect.  The service was great and the food was amazing.  I will be back!

This place is super fun!  Had a great experience here a few months ago looking for a low-key hangout in Downtown Phoenix.  I was pleasantly surprised with the live latin jazz and the food options were great too!    I recommend if you're looking for a smaller place free of heavily intoxicated people, this is the place to go.

The last time I did lip injections prior to seeing Dr. York at In Shape MD, was very painful.  The doctor I previously went to did not give me a dental block and instead, numbed my lips with a topical numbing solution and proceeded with injecting.  Needless to say it was very painful, the topical numbing gel didn't do what I thought it would, and I vowed to NEVER do it again.  So, four years later, I muster up the courage to give it a try again...    This past Wednesday I visited In Shape MD, and I spoke with Dr. Shannon York about my concerns with lip injections and the last experience I had.  Dr. York was understanding and very sensitive to my concerns and based on my history she suggested I get a dental block to numb the entire site.  I agreed to give it a try again and as you know if you've been to a dentist and had a dental block, you CAN'T feel a thing.  I spent a good 20 minutes in the chair with Dr. York as she was administering a dental block.  Dr. York was very compassionate and extremely gentle in administering the shots.  Given my history she wanted to make sure I was as comfortable as could be at all times and she took her time.  After the dental block set in she started administering the lip injections, and I was so pleased, because I could not feel a thing!!!  The procedure took about 45 minutes and by that time the dental block was starting to break -- thank goodness, because I did not want to walk around for hours with a numb face.  Within two hours, I had complete feeling again and very minimal discomfort around the injection site.  I would highly recommend visiting In Shape MD if you're considering any type of non-invasive cosmetic procedures, because Dr. York is a wonderful and very compassionate.  It's been about a week since my lip injections, and I couldn't be happier with the look.  The swelling is pretty much 100% gone and my lips look great.    I am looking forward to visiting In Shape MD again for other cosmetic procedures. :P
