I thought I was in a bad dream last night, my sitter was late like I missed the first part kinda late. I was steaming mad grrrr when I got to the Box office it was already closed of course, because who would actually be that late for a show! After peeping thru the doors we were directed to the head honcho, he politely gave us our tickets and instead of us interrupting the people already seated he decided to put us in some empty balcony seats on the lower level. It was great! I never made it upstairs and mind you I was late but from what I saw and the staff being so helpful when I thought the night was totally ruined they get 5 star's from me!

I think Max, Eric & Jason summed this place up pretty well. I dont think I'd ever get a dance here. It was Friday about 10pm-ish we were there about an hour I did not see one attractive girl come out. In fact this was the worst line up I have ever seen...EVAR!! I wont nit pick about the girls I saw but I will not be returning either. Ladies if your feeling down about a little weight gain go here.....hell who am I kidding even i it's a lot of weight gain, do your self esteem a favor and start your night here!!

Everything about this place rules the bakery, my fav is the pan dulce and they have never ending varieties of everything, the kitchen part is great food to order great prices, the refresco cold drink bar with fresh fruit yummm. It is a huge place and has lot's of elbow room. If you are into meat you will love their meat dept. it is muy gigante! FUN FUN place for everyone for sure!!

I popped in quickly to see if they took debit the girl behind the counter looked at me blankly and then at her father at least I am assuming thats what he was. He answered for her that they do so I told them I would return. I was early in meeting Amanda B. and Kevin H. so I parked myself at a table. I speak Spanish, does it say that some where on my forehead??? People seem to just "KNOW" this for some reason. Even when I responded in English they continued to speak Spanish to me here. I finally gave in and went with it, the girl said "Ah so you do speak Spanish" like it was some sort of test. She was very polite she did not speak English though and I basically translated for everyone throughout the meal. I have not had El Salvadoran in a really long time so I don't really have anything to compare. I deducted a star because everything had pork bits in it except the salsa and tortillas. I would go again if I was in the area, next time I will clarify no meat when I order.  Bean & Cheese Pupusa - awesome very good minus the pork Chile Relleno - very good, totally different than Mex. on the inside it was stuffed full of pork, potato and carrots among other stuff it reminded me of a stew minus the liquid. Horchata - Fresh from scratch very very delicious and sweet sugar high achieved  I would like to try the soups they looked good and a little pricey.  Thanks to Kevin for getting the tip you and Amanda are wonderful company!

"Are you kidding me Laura?!?!" "OMG we are going to get shot!!" "Dude this is a fucking double wide."  This is what I heard upon entering the parking lot.   "Hell yes we are eating here I don't care what you say!!"  I like it no matter if Veronica R (my sister) did not like their green chili. Its a taco place order the tacos!! Yes the rice was overcooked and a bit crunchy hopefully its not like that all the time. The beans were FANTASTICO they tasted like the ones my Abuelita used to make. The salsa was not for the weak its nice and spicy just how I like it. I had the shrimp tacos as my entree see pics, they were delicious I cleaned my plate!!  Cheapest beer ever I had a Bohemia for $2.50 they are $6 anywhere else!! We also took some Horchata and a Mansanita glass bottle to go mmmm. This place was clean and reminded me of Mexico inside, if I am in the area I would not hesitate to stop in here for a bite.  Shout out to Danny S for recommending! TY!!

So we have been ordering Flamingo Palace for the last 15 years believe it or not! One of my first apartments was really close and I worked across the street. Once again I find myself nearby and I've probably had it once a month since I moved in April. I love the crab puffs, potstickers and hot & sour soup among plenty of other things here! Unfortunately my orders have to be without chicken, beef, or pork now but luckily they have lots of seafood and non meat options. This used to be our fancy Chinese food date place if you know what I mean ;) *winkface*  When its rainy like it has been who wouldn't want some yummy soup delivered!?!? You can keep your Chino Bandido I will keep my Flamingo all to myself thx.

This place has just had a makeover while I'm not sure why it seemed to be packed all the time when there were sports on the various big tv's. This place is best known for their wall of Flame. LOL ok so they have a hot wing challenge. These arent just any wing's they call them "Atomic" made with habanero sauce mmmmm does that sound good or would you rather drink battery acid!!? So the challenge is to eat not a dozen but all 13 wings in one sitting. I dont remember if their was a time limit its possible there was. You must sign a waiver before you do this for liability reasons you must be in good health as well.   If you do all this (we've had 2 crazy friend's do it so far) you get a free shirt that says your a flamer, and you get your picture taken a copy goes up on "The Wall of Flame." YAY I would go here just to watch people do this very exciting!! They have other food and beer like a normal sports bar its worth going at least once to see what the deal is with those wings!   TIP: I saw one couple both do the challenge and they used forks to take the meat off the bone sntead of getting the sauce all over their lips and face. They were smart!! I'd do it like them if I ate wings!!

Set out to find some dinner with the fam at 8pm Monday night this place is basically across the street from me now. I thought, well this place has been here for years I've never tried it but there must be something good about it.......right!?!? I thought to myself eh WTH! After arguing with my munchkin to get out of the car for 10 mins because she wanted McDonalds instead (it was in her little 6 yr old view from the car) I finally lured her out with her DsLite! YAY So we walk in and were going to be seated in the dining room but we figured its 8pm the last quarter of the Indi & Miami game was on and the place was pretty empty after a quick glance around. We decided to sit in front of the big screen in the bar area! We made the right choice they have Italian soccer jersey's decorating the bar area and I felt very Italian by the end of the night. The server was excellent I repeat EXCELLENT with a capital E. Sorry I am no good with names and forgot his name but he was a tall Italian with some killer eyes complete with full accent!  Peroni on tap you say!?!?! Score!! We started with some fried mozzarella it was DELICIOUS the marinara was fresh really chunky and tomato-y! The munchkin loved it and they even gave her Sprite in a cocktail glass. Who care's you say??? Well she will remember this for ages she even talked about it at home hours later. "Mom that was the fanciest glass I've ever had!" This place made her forget about McD's which I give 2 stars for entirely!!   The bread was nice, it was toasted which the munchkin loved, she said she loves it toasted where its nice and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside mmmm! Her words not mine. Ultimately the kid felt really comfy at this place where she is usually really shy and non speaking. The only thing with the bread was instead of olive oil they brought out packaged whipped butter which wasn't bad and I probably could have asked for some oil but I'm not really complaining here so fugetaboutit kwim!  The specials that were not on the menu sounded fantastic so we went with them!! After the past weekend and watching Anthony Bourdain in Southeast Asia eating clams I had to have the fresh linguine and clams w/ white sauce. It was DELICOUS!! They will pretty much make any order the way you want it white or red sauce etc. I for one appreciate that aspect. The man had the pork chop stuffed with prosciutto and mozzarella with a tasty marsala wine sauce and mushrooms mmmm he only gave up one bite for me but it was choice!  We passed up on dessert but not without the waiter bringing us some shots of their in house homemade limoncello!! OMG just ask how they make it and for some sugar on the rim if you like that sort of thing it was awesome!! That totally topped my night!! I cant wait to go back and try the eggplant parm next! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Ciao Bello/Bella's!!

How I love you for kids birthday parties!! Especially when its not my own kid. Free pizza, ice cream, wings, and sometimes when your really lucky like me beer. That's right free beer!! No Peter Piper does not give away free beer you dunce but if you go to a party here there's a good chance you'll get some for free. Its not Dave & Busters but it doesn't cost an arm and leg to go here either. I have become a pro at the ticket games if you hit me up I might tell you my secret. The staff is always super friendly even when your kid cant make their mind up over what kind of prize they want with all those tickets they just won. Its a great place when its too hot out and you don't want to clean up a giant mess after having a bunch of kids over at your own pool. Have your party here while your kids are young before they out grow this place!   So as I'm writing this I'm thinking of the Wedding Crashers. Now taking applications for a Birthday Crashing partner are you in?? I will supply the child. Lets go!!

My little one and I stopped in for a sweet treat the other day I let her choose. We had the chocolate mousse cups and my bad I didnt take pics because I couldnt wait to dig in. Working from top to bottom it was in layers. It had a huge fresh strawberry on top it was garnished w some thick chocolate slivers then there was the cream so light and fluffy I mixed it with the mousse at the very bottom there was a small layer of choc cake  and the whole thing was in a flower petal shaped cup made completely of choc. The little one could not eat all of hers and it was hard to waste such goodness but I didnt want to overdose. Mental note next time one to share is good. I also bought a few of there decorated pretzels they are such pretty little works of art I want to    recreate them and put them on my kitchen walls! The staff is always pleasant here AJ's has always been a fav of mine I like their catered dessert trays they are always a hit!

Went in here today cuz the kid wanted a rodent. We dont have dogs since we moved into an apartment and she really wanted some kind of pet. I wasnt really interested in having something that needs a bunch of attention so I thought a hamster would suffice. They did not have rodents at this store but the staff was really nice and the owner suggested a rat for companionship and intelligence instead of gerbils or hamsters which they didnt even carry.   They had a large assortment of fish and reptiles here it was much larger than I thought it would be on the inside. It's Local owned small and they have every type of food you would need for any pet including rodents. Dog leashes and accessories as well. They had a small case of dog pastries that looked good enough for me to eat!! Donuts and cookie looking type treats for your dog that were healthy and fresh. They had a few kittens and puppies but they were from friends of the owner no puppy mill type of ish here. I will go here instead of PetSmart for food any day!!

This place kinda sucked. We went araound lunch time so it was almost at full capacity I fig it would be ok since it was full and all. It looked like there was 2 people working here. I give props to the mex girl cooking all the food. It's cafeteria errrr um Subway style mexican food they ask you what you want and add it to your burro or w/e you get a tray and sit. I had a veggie burrito which was basically rice and your choice of black or pinto beans they did have 3 tortilla's to choose from. It was a pretty big burrito and fairly good but nothing special. The kid had a chicken quesadilla which was tiny they put like maybe a tablespoon of chicken in it with a side of cinnamon chips they gave her like 4 chips and a small ftn drink not very much for the 4.25 kids meal if you ask me. Their Salsa bar was disgusting with wilted cilantro, salsa's, limes and lemon's. The only plus here is the drinks! They serve good beer here Modelo, dos XX, Cuervo rita's, and even 99 cent margaritas everyday which I did not try. They also had fountain jugos. I may go back next time but more for the drinks.

Now I'm not from Kansas City but I started eating meat again awhile ago and I'm pretty picky about what kind of meat I put in my mouth believe it or not! I havent had a pork sandwich in a few years and I usually hate teh pork!! The way this was cooked, seriously it was not fatty or I never would have polished the whole thing off. I liked it that much! I have no qualms with throwing shitty food in the garbage where it belongs. The taste was really good with just the right smokey flavor the meat was tender and not dry. I was so full I didnt even touch my sides so I cant say anything about the fries, onion rings, or slaw. It was a bit pricey but this totally hit the spot for me the other night....that is all!

The last time I went I was sooo happy with the food now I'm sooo sad. The day before New Yrs Eve I was craving some good BBQ. I promised myself no more meat except fish starting New Years. So this was pretty much my last hoorah. I was looking forward to it ALL day!! I had a burnt ends sandwich with fries and onion rings. Well I couldn't even finish the sandwich! It was dry and tough and tasted pretty salty. About half way through my stomach started crying for help. I felt like dude on Man Vs. Food I was determined to eat it but it turned awful. I had to stop eating and I thought I was going to die. I had a gallon of tea after that and luckily pulled through alive. Not at all like last time. NOT ONE BIT!! Oh fries were not good either not like McD's they were pretty greasy more like Two Hippies but without the thickness. Onion rings were ok  meh nothing to write about.  Still sad about the whole thing!

While this food did not make me Kim Jong Il by any means and I don't particularly LIKE Chinese even....steer clear of this place. This was not my choice but it is nearby and unsuspecting hungry people may fall into the trap of ordering some delivery from here especially around the holiday's. Here is your warning. The food was bland no flavor, orange chicken was soggy, pot stickers were the worst I have ever had and I LOVE potstickers PEOPLE!! Chow mein was watery and tasteless. The ONLY thing that was decent was the crab puffs so next time I crave them I just might order them and maybe try some soup. What can I say I might be a glutton for punishment. ;)  Oh also when visiting this shopping mall which I have done many many times this place is pretty much empty except for maybe lunch. FYI.

So I have been going here since I moved back in May I tried all the other grocers around here too but seem to come back here much more often. They have a Wells Fargo in here which is convenient for me. They have a great alcohol selection that even includes some awesome craft brews. They have managers specials that are fantastic like 6 pieces of mixed fruit for just a buck!! I picked up some ginormous cups here for a buck each that are actually made in the USA!!    On Halloween they had a little set up for the kids to eat cookies and drink cider. They had cake decorating too my girl loved it!! Speaking of kids they also have day care up in here! I would so take advantage of this option if I had a toddler. I like the neighborhood feel of this Bashas and supporting local helps me sleep at night. There is one down side to things but its never really bothered me. There are not enough cashiers at times and it could be a problem if you were in a hurry all the time.

Luckys closed so that left me looking for new pizza. I am not sure why we never ordered from here before I mean this place has been there forever!! I am glad we finally tried it pizza and wings it was gooood! The sauce is fresh tastes like its supposed to and not sweet or sugary like some other place. I am pretty picky with the pizza and ordered from here 3x now without reading about it here first. Now I know not to order anything but the pizza which is fine by me!

So....You say you want authentico?? My family secret shhhh! This place is owned by a lady named Maria. We have dubbed this place just "Maria's" we have been going here for year's!! When the white folk's around me say let's go to Valley Luna I have to school them on what's real food. This food is pure Jalisco and it is what it is! If you want some good home style cookin' in this part of town I would stop in for a bite! You better believe that this place gets busy for dinner so plan accordingly or don't go at peak times for those who don't like crowds. This is a nice little place w a bar and tv's. My sibling's would live here if they could my sister swears by the green chili burro, not for the weak as it brings the heat. I don't eat meat so I get the norm cheese enchiladas, chile relleno, etc all super in my book. I will take pics soon in the meantime here is a recent write up about the place http://www.azcentral.com/ent/dining/articles/2008/03/20/20080320elconquistador.html  P.S. Closed Monday's

We walked in expecting everything to be new and fresh...like the commercials say??? Well ehhh wrong, there was new menus however. My friend said "Maybe they come and switch out the lamps after you sit down just like on the commercial?" We had fun with this so he asked the waiter. The waiter informed us that they are one of the few that will be staying with the original theme Tiffany lamps and all. After he left I thought to myself....  What if they didnt change any of them?!? What if they give you that BS story at every RT you go to?!? What if they get away with it??? Somone should confirm this for me!!  Fresh Avocado Quesadilla Perfectly ripe avocados, grated Swiss cheese, and freshly made pico de gallo in a grilled flour tortilla. Very good for a veg-o-saurus like me mmmm I will go back. The new menu was the only reason I tried RT food again I usually just drink there for HR.

This place used to be well friendlier/nicer. My mom is a licensed professional for the last 30 years. Sometime's she need's emergency supplies while at work, who better to get them but her daughter that has nothing better to do. In a way I am her assistant I have been doing this since I was able to drive so 13 yrs. I used to be able to do this for her without any problem's. The new management however left me no choice but to shop somewhere else.   The last visit was very unpleasant from the beginning and my mother was with me no less! We were not greeted or helped in any way. I asked the manager where a product was she said they got rid of it and rushed off in a hurry. We finished our shopping and went to check out, now the manager started giving my mom a hard time about not having her license. Most people have them on wall's at work, why would she carry it around w her?!?! My mother is in their system and has been for ages why give her a hard time now? The girl finally does something un-lazy and goes online to check my mom's status it took forever so yay right?! Now we're getting somewhere...wrong!!   The girl wouldn't let me pay because I am not licensed!! At this point I am mad and it takes alot to make me mad. I ended up leaving the store they did not get any money that time and we will not be returning, they dont even carry the product we went there for to begin with but were still willing to spend $ anyway. It was clear they didnt need our sale's anymore so I will be happy somewhere else.

My friend was in the Service and had a craving for some Middle Eastern food so I pulled up Yelp and this seemed to be the closest in my area. I have driven by this place a gajillion times in the last 13 yrs or so and thanks to Yelper's I have learned that not everything is what it seems looks wise. It was 6:30 this Saturday we barely made it in time. It was clean I was happy to sit down inside and get out of the cold.  The server was pretty polite. The food took a little while but it was worth it. I had the Veggie Platter they were out of something they substituted with rice bit it was all good. Great humus and falafel yummmm I want more now lol I love love grape leaves and cant get enough now I know where to go to get my fix! The lentil soup was awesome and served steaming hot in this weather totally hit the spot with fresh pita bread. This was plenty of food perfect for sharing and I'm not even sure I'd ever order that plate for $12.99 on my own. My friend had the lamb kabob and some soup as well and no complaints here either.   They have hookah's and the good shisha my friend grabbed us some mint flavor which he love's I'm pretty sure its not any cheaper here than say a smoke shop. I saw a sign that said they have whole lambs and they had tons of stuff like gallon Tahini tubs and cute little tea sets among all the food stuff that looked good too. All in all I will be back to try some more delicous eats!

Totally diff from the Cantina in Scotts obviously no chips and salsa  here. This is a great neighborhood bar I basically lived here thru football season's ages ago. If you hate Raider fan's I suggest steering clear of the times they play (if they still have the club there that is) Raider fan's are crazy and it is usually not so much fun after the games when they lose which is most of the time! They do have many many tvs their site says 24 total. They have a seperate area for betting on the dog races that was always huge with the older crowd.   They use that canned shredded meat here in some meals which I think people immediately love it or hate it. I dont like it so much it's too salty and soggy but I never really liked meat anyway. I solved that problem and just eat sushi now, so who am I to say if the chicken is really good or not?!?! I am fine with some fried zucchini or those stuffed jalapeno things or even nachos minus the meat. I remember their wraps as being really good though! Don't confuse the bartender by asking for a foofoo mixed drink. You mill be lucky if they have some flavored vodka. Beer is king here and I seen a many people do Irish car bombs but hey you cant really get those wrong now, can you? Beer me please!

Oops I had put this under wrong Shogun. Sometime's this place can be hit or miss depending on who the chef is. I really miss the one they had on Dynamite it was alt larger but this one used to be tiny they have expanded and it's nice. Mainly we go there because we usually know atleast one person that still works there and their roll portions to me seem larger than most other places. You must order their specialty called the Surfer when I started going there ages ago it was not on their menu you had to ask for it, it is huge like aitleast 12 peices and tons of chunked up shrimp piled on top very yum! I like their octopus salad, salmon roe is always good there, and the tuna titaki has asways been a fav of mine as well. I have not been there in awhile but it's always a safe place I stop by if I am near. Its always clean from what I could see and I like their patio w the fire its cozy. We used to do quail egg shooter's those are always fun atleast once haha.

Have not made it to Shogun in a really long time. This time Monday right after the lunch rush and before they closed before dinner I was really surprised! The chef behind the counter Sergio totally recognized us right away it was comforting to know after going somewhere for 10 yrs falling on tough times and not being able to afford it for 2 yrs that you are still remembered. My tip is to sit at the sushi bar and no where else of course that's if there's an empty seat and you can. Each chef makes the rolls different I suggest you go with the OG chefs that know how to get it done.

I refuse to shop at any other dept store they have extra 30% off sale merch every once in awhile so those reg priced $400 boots on sale at 25% off are now just $210 I used that nifty calculator feature on this pc :) This location is always getting better clothing lines I love that they actually have a large "Missy" section so that I can dress my actual age and not like a Junior or Grandmother. No other store has sales like them even those Ross (Eww) Marshalls, Last Chance, types of stores cant compare but you dont have to believe me ;)

We celebrated my girl's momentous occasion here last Saturday. Her 7th birthday shit I'm getting old!!! I am here to forewarn you about having parties here so listen up or in this case keep reading!   Arrive with cake...check! Got shown to where the secret bat cave entrance was...a mile long walk on sidewalk w kids a cake and Metro Parkway traffic all within arms reach. Try not to have a an acute myocardial infarction. When you finally make it to the secret birthday entrance you will find that YES they can store your cake for you till party time. (Phew good thing!)  Guest arrival...check! They also have to find the secret entrance and No they can NOT hold gifts for you till party time as  "they aren't responsible" (this made me wonder about cake being safe hmmmm) "Please don't eat the cake or worse throw it on the ground!!!"  Sea Dragon was inop as well as Logride so the price was tad cheaper that was good news. The party room smelled like a boys locker room and the party helpers will butcher your cake. I suggest cake cutting lessons for these girls or cut it yo damn self!!! You get personal pizza's cheese or pep for each guest, pop and ice cream. The pizzas were better than expected for my taste and all the adults seemed pretty content even though there was no beer. They did have cappuccinos and hot chocolate for sale not bad either I wasnt there long enough to try anything else. The game castle is always fun, mini golf doesn't impress me much but to other humanoids this seems to be a favorite past time of sorts. FYI The Desert Storm no longer takes your picture so bring your own camera or phone and try not to lose it and/or a shoe on rides k. Long story lol.  All in all I prob wont have another party here for my kid but I don't mind stopping by with her for a few hours. There is hardly a wait time if your early and you can make a few good rounds quickly before all the ghetto riff raff wake up and get there with all of Bebe's kids!!! The rides are great for what they are here in this barren amusement state I guess. I'm from Cali and nothing compares let's get real AZ you ain't even tryin!!

So if you know me you know I love beer! I really wish I was one of those people that hated beer sometimes but Dear God I love beer!! I think its in my genetic code to love beer from both sides of my family. I'll admit if it wasnt for the beer I'd probably never come here but kids eat free on Mon & Tues. that means what??? You guessed it more BEER for ME!!! I did the beer sampler and fyi the tea here is a ripoff just drink beer. BEER ONLY!!! Got it???!?!   I had the NEW Mahi Tacos: Chile grilled they are wrapped in soft white corn tortillas with homemade pineapple slaw and fresh cilantro. Served with black beans, ancho chile rice and fresh pico de gallo.  -- My only gripe was the corn tortillas they tasted like paper but the rest was pretty delicous I was upset I couldn't eat all three tacos. You could easily share this plate between two gal pals!   Kid made her own pizza and what kid doesn't like making pizza?!?!?! Nuff said...  Oh yes did I mention I like the beer here!?!?!

OK been ordering here the last 3 mos now and will prob continue. The first time was before moving and they offered to help us move if we needed the muscle. That goes way above normal customer service if you ask me. Last month we ordered for the fights it was a bit late and their driver already went home for the night so dude makes his gf deliver to us. We had been driving around Jerome all day and barely made it back in time for UFC. Anyways they saved the night. They were out of fresh basil so he did tomato and fresh garlic. I dont really like strong garlic tastes or smells but this pizza was awesome!!! They will pretty much make you anything you want too.  The other night we ordered but we had run out of beer  so guess what. They charged us for a six pack and picked one up on the way!! This place rawks harder than any chigiddy chain chain!!!

It is deff a small hole in the wall place but excellent service, food and quick! My mom works at the barber/hair salon at the end of the row and I prefer Hiro to Ajo Al's any day of the week. If I take my mom to lunch it will be here. I have also been in with my kid and they don't seem to mind the mess she makes with the rice and Ikura =) thankfully she is older now O:-) They have great stuff like Toro oh yummmmm not too many places have it!! Thank you seafood sushi god's!!

A bit drizzly on Thurs. when we ended up here it was a bit before 3 the place was empty maybe 2 other customers while we were there. We were greeted by a nice lady who asked how many I replied 2 1/2 in Spanish she replied in to sit where we pleased. I wish it would have been nice out that day their patio looked like fun....maybe another day for happy hour yeah. My daughter loved the fish tank I just hope the catfish wasn't for eating later!! Yikes it was way too big for the tank and looked a bit out of place with the other goldfish.  Hot chips and 2 carafes of salsa came out w our waiter one hot and one not. YAY just how I like it!! I liked to mix them here to get the perfect amount of heat I like it was yummy the chips could have been a tad better some were a little too toasted. I had a chile relleno lunch their beans and rice were great no complaints the egg on the relleno was a little too peppery for me but I dont like pepper too much yet I still cleaned my plate. My mom had an enchilada she ate it up quick and the kid's plate was so cute w a mini taco my daughter liked that she could put the not hot salsa in the taco and eat it! =) Quick and very pleasant service. Could use a little dusting pics coming soon.

Advice for any Sprint user dont call their Customer Service and definitely DO NOT go to a 3rd party store! MOST say Sprint on them but their are only a hand full of official Sprint Nextel store's in the Valley and you should get to know them they have repair in house now too. It is dope. I went thru hell trying to get a repalecement on the old mans new Instinct. They were out of stock everywhere and it was defective what do you do?? They gave me a brand new replacement here within minutes they even gave me the entire box with all the batteries, chargers, etc. The girl was so helpful unlike ANYTHING I have ever exerienced with Sprint seriously. I wont be wasting my time anymore! I will never go anywhere else I have wasted so much precious time over the phone and at other stores!!

Have been going to this AH-SO for year's way before it got popular, you have to go in at the right time now if you don't like to wait. I like this one better than the one on 75th ave food wise it is better. I will write another review on that location for more detail's.The staff is alway's friendly although I can't say that for the waitress last night she didn't seem that interested in keeping us happy despite the $180 that was spent. My friend tipped her $25 he is very generous, if she would have paid more attention it probably would have been $50 but I digress...on to the food!!   I go mainly for the sushi, it is excellent! I am extremely  picky and like Ikura (Salmon Roe) it is alway's delicous and fresh here which is very rare around here. The specialty dish called Lobster Dynamite is to die for if you can afford it at $20, it's a must! The tuna titaki is oh so very melt in your mouth good and the green mussel's are also a fav of mine, perfect every time! For drinks I like their specialty Samaurai for a fruity but not too sweet drink umbrealla and all. The plum wine is very good there too if you dont want the traditional beer & sake.  We went teppanyaki last night I had the Calamari Steak dinner, my partner's in crime had the Chef Special (lobster and filet) he alway's has this fer teppanyaki, and the other had AH-SO special (shrimp/steak combo) all dinners come with soup/salad/fried rice/veggies I like the soup here it's not too salty like some miso's are and I always eat my salad too, the dressing is yummy. Plenty of food we can never eat it all and need a box. Teppanyaki is a fav for b-day's they sing and beat the drum while they bring you a tasty fruit boat. They also take your pic and you can put it up on their wall or take it with you  The staff is very friendly there. There is a huge pond fountain thing complete with koi and tiny trurtle in the center that seperates the teppanyaki tables from the dinner tables and sushi bar so you have your 3 choices. I have a 5 yr old and she love's the water feature, they even let her feed the koi at times. All in all you can't go wrong here with the food!!

While I wanted to try some place new this time out I had to compromise. The Happy Valley location was brought up and I begged and pleaded to come to this location instead I am really glad we ended up back here again. There was 5 of us including my daughter and niece that cant sit still for 5 minutes. We sat down for Teppanyaki and started everything off with sushi. I still highly recommend the Samurai drink its made nice and strong just how I like it! So this place is now owned by one of the chefs and his gorgeous wife. I cant remember their names I'm really bad at that after some alcohol. I can however remember food and I had THE best roll EVER!!! It was a chefs special and it was the RED roll sooo frign good. Spicey and not sure if I'll have any other roll again. It was gorgeous see pics. I will not go to another Ah-So location this is it the best folks! It may not be huge like the one on Happy Valley but it will leave a great taste in your mouth!!  My niece of 8 yrs loved it by the way she had never been!

So this was years ago but the story needs to be told anyway. I am sure things havent changed here it was hard to get a totally overpriced drink here and even harder to get a lap dance but well worth it in the end. I blacked out after leaving here beer in hand on the cab ride back to the suite. Made it safely to bed and made a baby that night. Its not true what they say...."Whatever happens in Vegas stays in Vegas!" Liars...Not all of it does!

This was also my first play, sad I know! Although I missed the first half of "The Clean House" I was lucky enough to find someone that caught me up to speed! We got seated on the lower level left balcony very close as soon as I sat down I pretty much laughed thru the rest of the play, it was a great story! I had no idea there was cussing in the theatre! The cast was excellent, I am also a fan of Felicity La Fortune (Lani) she appeared in a soap I used to watch I thought she was fantastic!! I missed the Wicked Bakery & Gelato spot stuff afterward's no worry's Wicked is near by and I am planning a visit soon, like tomorrow lol! Seeing the play was a treat all by itself a good time was had! Thank you Yelp and Gabi!!

It's a nice venue that's for sure, but you have to pay an arm and a leg for drink's so they get 4 star's! $30 for 2 mixed drinks can you say ouch!!?! You unfortunately have to come here to see some acts so no choice but to get smashed before your arrival possibly somewhere near by you can walk to ;)

Well I wouldn't really call this place a "cocktail lounge" like sayyyy Side Bar but to me it was more like a very well lit pool hall. Even though there was no smoking inside it was hekka smokey in this place. I am guessing this place is 21+ thats why people like it oh and cheap drinks!?!?! I'm not sure but this place KIND of reminds me of River City Pockets with less pool tables?? If this was like the only option available I'd go if you made me, cuz you cant fool me twice. I'd rather just sit home and drink myself to sleep.

I have used this place for almost 10 years!! We used to have a wood deck when we moved in it seemed to be a good hiding place for creatures of all sorts. We have called them for many thing's gecko's, hornets, termites  you name it everything but scorpions hehe. I am sure this place has gotten busier with all the development around here but I still make them send out my original pest guy, his name is John. They have tried sending others out and I haven't liked any. They dont mind sending him out and if he ever retired I'm not so sure what I'd do! I am not sure you can have that kind of relationship w/ your Pest Control people but the office girls are really nice too. If you have any probs w/in the 30 days they will come out again at no charge. They also have some organic spray you can ask for.

I was hekka hungry today and my friend suggested we go here. We rounded up the apartment troops and hopped in his Hummer around 8pm. There was no wait and we were the last ones to come in just before closing. I was a bit worried since it was a party of 8 and it was so late but we basically ended up with the 2 servers to ourselves after the rest of the customers left.   99 cent margaritas all summer!! WTH and they were not in miniature glasses either!! OMG I saw customers with mi cheladas and other giant margs. Their chips were fresh and hot not greasy or salty. The salsa could have used more bite to it but the kids enjoyed it as well as the bean dip that I couldn't stop eating.   My friends son had the waitress's wrapped around his finger they were very attentive and kept stopping to get kisses from the little guy. The men had the carne asada plates that were ginormous and left nothing behind. I had the enchiladas suiza's and my partner in crime had the fajitas. Mine was good there wasnt really any heat to it but the chicken was cooked perfect. It was all really good I cant wait till I'm hungry again for leftovers. The little ones had pizza's and fries it kept them entertained and their meals included ice cream for dessert. I was really impressed by how nice the staff was way after closing time and they never made us feel like we needed to hurry. They made sure the margs were constantly flowing. The menu had everything but tamales I think. I will be going back to try this hibiscus infused marg it sounded delish!! Party of 8 the bill came to $107 not bad at all!   P.S. If you happen to like Coronas they are $1.25 on Tuesdays.

So I had to go to the giant pet corp I loath because no one had rodents in the area. Not for pets anyway. The sales associate Tyler was super helpful!! He was really educated and reiterated what I was told about rats over a gerbil or a hamster for a pet. He had lots of pets of his own so he knew what was up. After an hour of talking and looking for the pets new house there wasnt much to choose from for a rat. There was tons of housing for mice, gerbils, and hamsters but rats need much larger homes and cant fit in small tubes of which there was a giant array of here. They had a giant cage that was $99 which I wasnt ready to spend but I will keep it in mind if I decide to get anymore.   So far this little Ratatouille has been very chill and likes to kick it on your shoulder. Hopefully this Dumbo Rat will last awhile. The daughter is already saying its her best friend!!

I don't usually drop off the dry cleaning but alas sometimes I must help. The poor old man kept using garbage bags for transporting laundry and I was sick of it. I made it into the nice humid space and the man behind the counter greeted me with a cheery face. I bothered him for a reusable bag as some people want to do their part for our planet. He did not hesitate to give me a bag, he is probably happy he will never have to throw away a trash bag of mine again. He proceeded to ask me if the kid could have a sucker and me, always being the sucker I am for strangers with candy I gave in. The kid was happy. C'est la vie.

Their sign says the nicest place on earth or was it happiest....wait thats Disneyland. I think. Anyway, the folks behind the counter are very nice and helpful. I like that they have pasta here and the meat is sliced right in front of your eyes if your into that sort of thing. Everything always looks really fresh even today at 4 pm. I have been coming here forever and will continue to do so.

This store used to be closer to 19th Ave & Bell they have since moved and expanded a ton over the last few years. Everything is made fresh daily ceviche, guacamole, salsa's, they have pan dulce delivered every morning yummm. You can pick up the old school soda's here, and good Mexican Favs like Pinguinos, Gansitos, Duvalin, Pelon Pelo Rico, De Las Rosa, and even Bimbo bread just to name a few thing's they carry here. They have natural all organic small game hens that can be stuffed or bbq'd you can ask for their rub they have all kinds of meat most get the Ranchera here for some carne asada you just need to be able to say how many "Libras" (Pounds) and you want them to make it "Preparada" they will put in their special marinade w oranges, onions, and spices in the bag. If your a meat eater you cant go wrong here. I cant get enough of this place!!

This place has been here for EVERRRR It's behind the Big O Tires in the same parking lot as a bunch of car shops. This was the original "Raider" bar of N. PHX. for over 10 years I guess its under new ownership now and the new owner ousted the Raider Club. Ouch this place used to be packed!! I haven't been here in awhile, well since I had a kegerator and with these bad times I found myself here again last night for a bit while the Fiesta Bowl was on. You would think with sports on that people would be here but the parking lot was pretty empty. It was about 8-ish and the bar was quite bare with only a handful of patrons sitting at the bar possibly just for the barbie bartender behind the counter in a tight corset. It was just my brother and I but we didnt get greeted upon entering or feel welcome so much. They only had Bud, Bud Light and Amber Bock on tap and what looked like a decent selection of bottled beer. The staff wasn't overly friendly or attentive to us with my brother practically having to beg to buy another round.  The atmosphere was just pretty blah all around. The projection screen looks to be the same old one and is in dyer need of being replaced. The flat screens above the bar are nice but thats about it. One more good note looks like they put in a smoking patio that seems new and some fresh paint outside to green and white. Used to be Silver & Black I guess this place really wants to set itself apart from those crazy Raider fans.   I didnt make it upstairs  to have a look around (they used to have pool tables) but most of the furniture looked to be the same nothing special or new. This used to be such a great place full of energy and happy people. We left feeling neglected and spent the rest of our money on scratcher tickets at the liquor store where they like us. I don't want to believe this bar is THAT bad so I plan on returning on a busier night, to give it another go and hopefully update with more stars??

I did not want to eat here I know better but sigh it's not always my choice. Nothing special here at all except for currently you can super size your margs for just pennies more. The pomerita on the menu is the only marg thats made with Cazadores very yummy hekk yes I say way worth it!! The salsa was eh with no heat or any real taste, this became the theme with the rest of the food through out the night. Spinach con queso was ok. I had the carnitas and the only thing I could taste was salt and way too much of it. Guacamole, rice and beans were pretty bland. Again, I didnt come in with high hopes but this dinner was something I wont be repeating chain or not I still have standards for good tasting food and this has not been it for ages. Sorry 2 stars here for drinks.

Everyone I know around here eats at Roberto's, they deliver and it is prob the best Mexican fast food in the near vicinity other than my Mom's cooking of course! Now I dont eat meat so when they can accommodate me with w/e the effffff I want and however picky my high maintenance self can get, well they get kudos in my book! They make a mean Chile Relleno Burro you can put w/e you want in it crema, pico, rice, beans they will customize it for you no prob. This is my fav relleno place on this side of town period! Dont forget the Horchata!

This place is similar to Rays on 3rd St. It was lunch time I had an eggplant parm sub very good the eggplant was nicely breaded not gooey and gross. The kid had a slice of cheese the slices are HUGE. The pizza and service here are always good. I suggest this place for dinner more so the meals are way better they come with a house salad and they have more options pasta and such. They deliver too.

This place has gotten a makeover. They are putting in more of the natural organic type of stuff and I like that. You are always greeted here and asked if you found everything ok. This store is not ghetto like the Fry's across the street. Trust me if you go to both you will know what I mean its like a whole different world over there. Twighlight Zone comes to mind. Thats a whole other review.  I had to make an emergency stop for my brother so I decided I would just get my shopping out of the way. I dont usually do Safeway so I was pleased to find organic baby food for my niece. There was live hydroponic gourmet butter lettuce, Milton's cracker's, and Pirate's Booty. Quite a few advancements since the last time I shopped here.  They helped me out to my car and thats always a plus for me. Staff is always very pleasant. I wouldn't mind returning so much!

I was on my way to Port of Subs but it was crazy packed and I hate crowds so I kept driving and found this place thought I'd give it a try. Oops My bad!! The kid was nice behind the counter when I asked what was good. I ordered what he suggested a 6 inch Italian type club for my meat eating brother and a what seemed harmless enough a stuffed tomato w egg salad for myself along w drinks, chips, and a cookie for the kid to go. It was $17. He even gave me a box to carry the drinks safely!   I get to my bro's and we sit down to eat. I open my box and it was ahem a layer of lettuce on the bottom with a totally unripe light pink tomato cut into wedges w the egg salad poured on top. Ummmm it was bad folks I couldn't even bare to take a picture. There was nothing good about this or worth the $6 it cost. My bro is like Mikey he will eat anything well he ate the sandwich but it was drenched with ranch WTF I dont remember asking for ranch. It also had the same pink tomato's in it. Honestly not sure how this place stays open when even Subway would be better. This place gets 2 thumbs down. Maybe breakfast would be better!?!?

Use to go here many moons ago as my nearest bar but with better music and boobs =-o  The girl's here are sometimes' below avg I have not boon in atleast a year thing's could change but I doubt it. The DJ was awesome he may be a manager there now tho. The girl's had to use the same restroom as the lady customers so that was always a + for me ;) seeing who washes their hands or not lol. Only one sink worked if you were lucky and possibly 1 working toilet. The girl's would smoke in there well when you could anyway dunno about now. Heard the mens room was much nicer with an attendant and ice in the urinals. If you reserve w bottle service you will be well taken care of. It's a conveniant place for some fun and would always go again if the boys are buyin =) I'd get valet so they watch your car its in a shadey area but they have done alot of remodeling inside as well as out!   4 stars cuz of ladies room

FYI: There is a cc charge of $2 if you dont spend atleast $10 which I dont really mind because I like using cold hard cash shame on me I know!

How does an extra 50% off of some of the already reduced merch sound?!?! This is also one of my local secrets so listen carefully Yelper's. This location does this sale unadvertised as they use this one as a semi clearance outlet. This means some of clothes are shipped here for a super cheap last chance sale without the gross "Last Chance" feel. For example a beautiful little dress I found for $65 was originally $600 yes you read this correctly $600. That was the biggest whammy all the others were anywhere from $13-$23! I shopped here Weds. for my first Elite event @ Fez I walked out w 5 dresses total and paid a tad over a bill. I could not resist and went again yest. w my sister again 4 more dresses I never even made it to any other part of the store!!   All good stuff like BCBG, Jones NY, Lauren, Laundry, Steve Madden etc. It is still a normal Dillard's with load's of new full price stuff as well.  I may be going back for round 3 today w my mom and never have to shop again for 3 years! I will update on the men's section if I make it over there.  Stimulate this W ..!.. (o.o) ..!..

I cant seem to go any where else for special occassion cakes . The owner's name is also Laura, no its not me but they are a great family owned little place. Lunches are pretty good I have found for best selection of pastries and cookies is early in the a.m. go figure! There service is excellent I heart them. I will add my cake pics, they do an awesome job.

"This place is cool not sure what it was called before but they renovated and expanded and it's not sooo dive-ish anymore lol. The owner took over what it was so he decided to tailor it to the same crowd. Mainly biker's bar but it now has space for live entertainment and dancing I suppose!?! Food is alright but I suggest sticking to drink's here with a happy hour spanning from 10-7 that is just crazy!! I thought biker's didn't drink?? Maybe thats the sissy biker's I'm thinkin about hmmm!??! If you like the smell of leather I highly suggest trying this place oh they also have a full service patio for dining/drinking.  Saturday Band every sat. 9:30 pm-1 am $1.50 DOM Wells   Sunday Free BBQ   Monday Chips & Picks Poker @ 7pm   Tuesday Stripper & Students $1.50 Dom Bottles & Well Drinks   Wednesday Open Mic @ 9:30   Thursday Reverse Happy Hour 11pm - Close   Friday Band every Friday 9:30 pm-1 am"

This place is awesame I'd stay there again in a heartbeat! They have everything you could possibly ever need incl. golf & tennis of course. We stayed here for a conf the room was plenty spacious with your own patio. You even get a "Sleep Kit" it came w a relaxing cd soothing sounds, an eye mask, and a lavender mist personally being a girly girl I was ecstatic. I spent 2 days there and loved every minute the staff was friendly and helpful in every corner. I thought the food was even good here to my surprise!   I thought it was super easy to find coming from the 202 right off the frwy cant miss the place it is huge. I did not fear for my safety in this part of town my only regret is not getting out to see this part of Chandler more. I will be back, but only for more leisure next time!

If I am shopping all day at the square I will stop here for sushi especially when it's happy hour. I have probably been here too many times but the sushi has never made me ill, I think that says a whole lot. The Ikura (Salmon Roe) is always fresh here, green mussels are always good here. I like that if I have my brat w me she can have pizza if she doesn't feel like sushi. I agree I probably wont go out of my way to eat here but if I am in the square I cant say no to sushi. It's not the best but its consistently pretty good! The service can be hit or miss but I have had some awesome Mojitos here they never skimp on the mint yummmm!

Worst tortilla soup I have ever it tasted it was like a hot bowl of salsa plain and simple. If I would have been given chips I may have eaten it. The server was really cute and attentive but she had no clue what to suggest for a non meat eater I was struggling to find anything appealling here. She finally suggested a salad. It was good it had candied walnuts and dried cranberries w goat cheese on it but by the time I got it everyone had eaten and I stole a bunch of their fries so I couldnt eat the whole colassal salad. I just read Dallas' review I wish the girl would have suggested their veg burger sad. I might go back if I had to. I used to live at Zipps years ago but mainly for the football and booze not the food meh.

It was grand opening night. The space is lovely and filled with great art every where you look. Razz and his wife were excellent hosts as if you were coming in to their home making sure everyone was having a good time. The service was impeccable. I guess this place is closed during summer months I had no idea this was even here I had no idea what to expect. The only complaint I have is there wasnt enough non meat options but I bet on a regular day the regular menu would have more to chose from.  The Sepetember Wine Dinner as follows Oxtail Hash with Truffle Glaze Baby mixed green bundle, toasted Macadamia nut vinaigrette Paired with Pouilly Fusse 04 The presentation was so neat pics coming soon. I could not get enough of the greens and dressing.  Scallop en Croute (The hugest scallop I have ever seen EVER) Seared with Fois Gras duxelle in pastry, roasted strawberry & rhubarb compote with a Mersault '04. This was so frikn good HELLO YUMGASM!!  I didnt have the rest of the pairing but they seemed to go over pretty well. There was Veal Loin en Papillote steamed in a parchment bag with wild mushrooms, asparagus & morbier cheese and the main course was a Peppered Beef Tenderloin w french green beans & almonds, spinach pancake, roasted potatoes with garlic.. I didnt care for the pancake and I hate pepper and beef lol but the green beans were spectacular seriously the best I have ever had, I dont usually like garlicy things and the potato was awesome I didnt waste any.   Pecan Sponge Pie with a bunch of different berries was totally heavenly. All in all I really cant wait to go back when I can pick what to try!! If you have the money to splurge you need to try this place fa sho!!

I must be getting too old because I've had enough of this place and I'm officially drawing the line. Never again mmmmmk thx! Been here many times come to think of it too many times. Yes dont go in here carrying anything but your ID and cash!! Wear flip flops if there wont be any moshing and as long as you dont mind a little drink spillage on your piggies you can bypass the shoe police.  After the "search" the 18 year old will take your ID take a photo and put you into some weird data bass you can see everyone who's drinking with you. Then the girl will look at your ID after for a few minutes maybe she is adding years in her head. "Yes I'm wayyyy older than you and yes thats my real ID trust me." Like I'd want to lie and be this old lol. Is that really necessary?!?!  Yes I have seen good shows here and it may be well worth the "closeness" you can get but I think I'm good. I am boycotting this place the employees are mind numbing and treat people like cattle. The only nice ones you will encounter are the ones manning the FULL parking lot, its always full guys ALWAYS. Boooo Marquee boooo Lucky Man it seems the only lucky person is you being able to book these shows.  I wonder if Rialto is any better it could be worth the drive.

I think I have hated Fat Tuesdays since they started opening in the Valley. The loud music will probably never let you down however. The slushy' are disgusting I really wish they would taste better. I try every few years and nothing changes ....EVER. Best on a hot day if you have to be out in public drinking shitty blended drinks I say.

We had an hour to kill before this year's Beer Fest at The Lakes accross the street. There was 5 of us so we ended up here one dead Sunday afternoon. What better to do before a beer fest but drink beer and wait entirely too long for some lunch. The place was dead not a soul in site and dark as hell inside. We ask to sit outside no big deal we thought, it took them 15 minutes to seat us the whole time having to look around at all the (insert sarcasm here) o so warm feeling Monti memorabilia. You ever get that feeling your being watched!?!! This place totally gave me that wierd creepy feeling all over, let's just say there is deff some diff energy there! Did not suprise me they sell maps of "Ghosts of the Grand Canyon State" along with some other really tasteless merch.   We finally get seated and wait again forever for our waitress, she finally come's to take our order but since it already took forever we were afraid to order any "REAL" food, after all we had somewhere to be and we even mentioned that to the waitress. Dont let that fool you though, she didnt move any faster. There was alot of waiting here and when we finally got the wing's and apps they were good the bread was awesome. I'd like to go back for a dinner service with maybe a more seasoned waitress!?!?! I also snapped a few pics outside I am in need of some models =)  2 stars for poor service 3 stars for the food

The lovely Sarah G decided to bless me w her awesome presence for lunch this afternoon. I am so glad we decided on this lovely House of Tricks! Does anyone know why its called that?!?! I'm curious please tell me??!?! Soooo this should really be 4.5 stars as everyone has said the service was a bit slow. A lot of places down here in Tempe seem that way to me. For some weird reason or another I feel like I enter the Twilight Zone and the waiters dont seem to have a need for time. Maybe they teach this course at ASU or maybe everyones just stoned, IDK!?!?!   The soup of the day was some carrot ginger thing with creme it did not taste like carrots at all whatsoever but it was super delicous and I dont even like ginger haha!! Sarah took a pic of the salad I had. I had the best salad EVER!!! Moroccan Fruit and Chicken Shawarma Salad with Mango, Melon, Strawberries, Oranges, Toasted Pine Nuts, Citrus Cous Cous and Baby Field Greens with Preserved Lemon Vinaigrette. I substituted the chicken for some Tombo Ahi it was a few dollars more but OH SOOO WORTH IT!! Abso-fucking-lutely YUM-GASMIC!! The chef here is a fucking genius and I will never have enough of this place.....EVER! Where is Gordon Ramsey when you need him to light a fire under your server's ass to get the tables turned around quicker??   I will surely bring all out of towner's here for dinner and do more special occasions here in the future. Wine tasting is on Tuesdays I better move closer!! So when are we going?!?!?

Have lived around the corner from this place for almost 4 yrs and finally ate here 3 months ago. Guess what? Been in here almost every week since. Especially for the CAT FISH fillet EVERY FRIDAY it's amazing!!! I can't say everything has been perfect every time but it's pretty darn great!! Chile relleno so good, carnitas good, carne asada good, beans, rice, green chile, love the homemade tortillas!! I'm hekka picky with the Mexican food and this place is nice, the food has tons of flavor. If you want that bland no flavor Mexican food is probably pass. Employees are friendly even when your kid spills an entire soda all over the table!! Just call us regulars here.

Finally awake early enough to try this place so I sent the old man out on this cloudy day to go fetch me some donuts. While he arrived after 10 which is really late on a Sat to get donuts duh he did come back w my goodies! They even took a tray of glazed donuts to the back to throw some maple on for the kid! That's going that extra mile if you ask me!! You know the donuts you get at Bashas or Albs that are more like wax tasting than anything? Well these are the opposite and I couldn't stop eating them!! Sooo good and I'm excited it's around the corner from me! Next time I go earlier so I can try them all! Two thumbs up!

I'm here every week I guess you could say I like the place a little =) its pretty clean and there's 2 sets of bathrooms yay!! Staff is really nice, you can get growlers filled here and beer to go. Great local brews on tap and such, tons of tvs, pool tables, darts etc and fish tacos are super yummmm. Mainly go here in the afternoons but I am sure this is the place to be at nights in the area. Just go here you'll like it, its a great bar!!!

We did the 10 minute flight over the strip, the tour van picked us up in the secret Venetian parking lot in the rear where no one can see whats really going on. I had to squeeze in the back of this grimey van next to some odd couple it was the only place I could fit, luckily I am small otherwise who knows how this would have worked! My partner in crime rode shotgun rather than attempt fitting anywhere else in the dirty sardine packed van. They drive you to their office. The whole way I am texting my b/f my last will and testament, just in case! You get there and are told you will weigh in yay! You get some all you can drink cheap champagne in those fancy plastic cups ;) as you painfully wait to watch a safety video that basically sells their DVD's. Then you wait to get on another van that takes you to the actual airport. They pair you with 4 other people or 2 couples however way you want to look at it but it is done by weight. The pilot had the tour down he was very knowledgeable about the strip etc. I suggest not using your flash if the pilot says "ahhh Go ahead" I was dissapointed in the $35 video they get you waving before flight then again after landing its not even real sound and the dvd itself is just another advertisement I will probably never share with family or friends. You get what you pay for maybe?!?!  Next time I will check yelp first I promise!

I loved this place I saw some really pretty drinks and Guiness on tap yay! We were all wearing our tiara's of course for Allison's bday and everyone was super nice here! The barback was way HAWT anyone know if he's straight or not cuz he kept talking to us lol!?!? This has got to be my fav place down town my only gripe is the ladies bathroom could use a little more TLC the floor was pretty dirty, maybe a rug by the door!?!? I had no idea ladies shoes could attract so much dirt!! I cant wait to come back here!! Thanks for bringing us here Amanda!!

We went for my bday my sis and her friend hooked up the VIP bottle service. It was a Fri night we decided on the hip hop side downstairs big mistake after 11 they started having a Guitar Hero tournament. Luckily we were able to switch sides and pick another area for the night. The girl that was appointed to do the bottle service sucked major butt. She could not make a drink worth shit, why cant I make my own drinks here and have to settle for a half retarded girl instead of a real bartender when paying for bottle service!?!?! We had red bull and pineapple juice, mixing drinks should not be that hard one shot or 2 hello!?!?!  A part from that the music that plays for about 40 seconds then switches and is meant to totally screw with your brain top it all off the the cold as hell fog and you wonder why we are called cattle!?!? If you are into this sort of thing then I highly suggest this place and VIP would be the way to go but get someone that can make drinks for fucks sake and if theres 6+ girls they should have a hot guy making those drinks maybe then we wouldnt have minded as much.

WOW!!! I was totally shocked on how good everything was here, from beginning to end. I accidentally missed the street I was supposed to turn on and ended up driving by here the other morning taking my sister to work. I saw it and told her I have been wanting to try it thanks to Jason C.   This place was amazingly empty there was 2 other men in here just finishing their meal. The awesome waitress was polite as could be, no fake Hi! How are you BS here. She brought us our menu's told us the specials and put napkins in our laps for us. We had some agua I have not had cantelope fresca since I was a little girl. It was even better when I got to taste it like a bit of heaven in my mouth. I seriously love that shit! Do you remember the food critic on Ratatouille when he takes a bite of the stuff and is off remembering his mother, that is exactly how I felt. It was that fucking good and the goodness did not stop here my friends.  We had the guaca-liscous dip, it was frign good with the sea salt and the 3 salsa's were so refreshingly spicy. We were getting full just from the chips but couldnt stop eating  the stuff, it was too good.   Next came the tortilla soup it was very good the chips were crunchy they were real chips not something from a bag. The cheese was tasty it could have used some spice and maybe some lime and crema, but I did not care one bit it was still very good just like that I ate it all.   The food came out shortly, we did not have any waiting time that we had noticed while being serenaded by the senor playing the guitar in the corner the whole time. The main dishes were way good as well. Beware the green enchiladas they are def not for sissy's. Bite after bite our palates were overly pleased. Can you say YUM-GASM?!?! I can, too bad all good things must come to an end and we could not stay here forever. Porque Asi Es La Vida!!

I still think this place is awesome for LUNCH. I have been back multiple times including the lovely Julia's UYE I was not too happy that night and will probably never do dinner here again. But lunch people.....lunch I just have nothing to frign complain about everyone I take here loves it the guac the tomatillo sauce etc everything has been a hit except the veg synchronizada it was boring with just mushrooms but the harsh reality is that you would probably never order a synchronizada because you dont even know what it is. I'm sure the others with meat are much better. FYI they are like a quesadilla but much better with those home made tortillas!

I said let's go somewhere else but I wasnt buying so I had no choice. Ahhhh TGIF on a Saturday night about 8pm not too bad we got right in w a party of 4 +2 kid's. Our server Morgan did a great job considering the kids bothering her every min and my hub being a complete jerk. He was kidding but not everyone knows his humor and usually its not very funny. If I was his waiter I'd be pissed luckily my generous friend made up for her hassle in the tip.   Food is consistently good here I have been maybe 3x all not my choice. Eagc time has been a pain free experience. The men seem to like the meat in the Jack Daniels sauce. I tried the Ahi Tuna burger's they are cute little burgers it came w some salad and some funky sauce that wasnt too memorable. See pics. Great place to take picky kids they will even serve them baby ribs can you feel the excitement of how fun this could be!?!?!

While I would never come here to actually see the Cards play I finally went to an event here. The Skin Art Expo, we went on the last day so it was probably the shittiest of days to go but good ole' fate always takes charge.  We walked right up no line for tix they did want to do a search at the door I had no purse just my camera in tow. They waved us in and told us to take the escalator down while going down 2 large escalators and finally arriving at our destination I could not help noticing the cold cemented walls everywhere it kinda felt unfinished like they were in a hurry to got this thing up and just gave up down under. Maybe they ran out of paint or ideas?!?! The bathrooms were pretty cheesy I think they are better at AMC but they did have plenty. All in all I came with nothing bought a $7.25 beer and left with a tattoo my day was complete!

I really liked this place it was dark and cozy, not loud at all. It was Saturday kinda late I suppose 12 or 1 am but it wasn't busy at all! I would have much rather come here instead of Chez No Dont period. The menu looked awesome I'd love to come back and try every libation they have to offer! The music was iffy but everything else made up for it. Server was totally pleasant everyone seemed friendly.Too bad its in that mythical land of down town that's so far from me. Thanks to Arik B. for making the good call.

A group of us went last night for Amanda B's sister's bday celebration. The bread was seriously Yumgasm inducing. The waiter was great he had no issues with the large party and making different checks for everyone he was very pleasant thats hard to find these days! Most people hate their jobs and it shows. I had the baked Ravioli it was delicous and my sister had the spaghetti w meat sauce it was a giant mountain of spaghetti plenty big enough for 2 I'd say! She enjoyed it as well. We will return!!

Widmer Hef sign in window...check!! How can you not stop and try it right??!? Pizza and sammies made to order...check! They even have gluten free options, awesome! I had the veggie medley it was delicous and big enough to share with someone if you wanted. Roasted spinach, mushroom, red pepper, caramelized onion, garlic, pesto, provolone cheese. Yum yum yum! Subway aint got nothin' on this place! The meatball was an even bigger sandwich you have been warned you will be taking home half of your food. I will be back asap this may be my fav new lunch spot while I'm out shopping out here!

I know I know sorry Yelper's!!! Please dont throw your cupcakes at me!!!   I went in this Thurs. with the mom and the kid. It was rainy and I had no make up on I may have scared Slade a tad I suppose. He asked if we were picking up an order ....shuckers no. ='( Slade told me the cakes were 2.75 and spouted off all the flavors to us. The dilemma was choosing which to get. We agreed on 6, 2 creme brulee, 2 red velvet, 1 carrot, and one chocolate something or other. See pics. Then I settled on 2 desserts the key lime thing that was amazing and the chocolate.      My Gripes...I guess I am a bitchy queen but I kept looking for some sort of menu and I could have missed it I suppose but never found one. I am a do it your-selfer I dont like bothering people for every little thing. A large menu on the wall would be cool if I missed it I am sorry please forgive me for being so bitchy.   Since it was rainy you couldn't sit in the chairs out front, I would have liked to have been able to sit and eat there maybe kick back a sec and watch the news on the huge plasma on the wall while I sipped on some tea. That would have been nice *sigh*   The cupcakes were really good and moist although I dont think the creme brulee actually tasted like creme brulee. The key lime dessert was my fav to DIE for and the other pastries looked fabulous too!! I will be back for sure Wicked but next time I will just  plan/order ahead before I go and now I know!!  P.S. I'd like to thank Eugene for his poo thread and making me think of  poop as I ate the choc one. My pictures do not do these cupcakes any justice and in no way shape, form remotely taste like poop!! They are great cupcakes!!

I finally made it back here to try some new goodies and was not disappointed!  The kid had a cheese danish and I grabbed some cupcakes the strawberry chocolate, red velvet of course, and some HOT chocolate habanero. I was totally warned of the hotness but I assured Slade and the cute counter girl I could handle it with my Hispanic-ness.  Lets just say that all these sweets didnt last long at my house everything was GONE that night! I had some family in from out of town and they were nice enough to leave me one red velvet cupcake. I was also lucky enough to try some of the Rocky Road candy bar it was pure peanutty goodness with fluffy little marshmallows inside, it was perfect and not too sweet yum. I am still drooling over it. I will be back very soon as I missed the Boba Tea! ='(

I have not been in alooong time to get anything pierced but as soon as I turned 18 I did the belly, then eventually the tongue and then the nose followed. I took atleast 10 friends there to hold there hand's. Oi I would still reccommend them to anyone when you walk in it feels cleaner than a hospital that's no joke. They are super cool and they know their sh*t deff pro's there!

There's not really much to say that hasn't already been said A) "Ghetto" 2. Gogo dancer's look pregnant  I was DD and this is a place my sister visits often, she is young still and hopefully she will learn. It's not alway's so that class come's with age though. I will pray for her. The bouncer's were very cute we paid our $5 and went up the stair's. Nice touch with the flickering strobe light's in the window, possibly a hazard for many drunk girls in heels coming down the stairs? Just a thought! Once we got in I kinda looked around dumb founded by the mess of it all. This place was so grimey I did not want to touch anything so we just stood there for 2 song's I gave my sister the "Are you kidding me?" look and we left. Please keep in mind that I was not drunk that could have been a factor!

I would rather go to Benihana to be honest. I have been here a few times because its so convenient but has never been worth it in the end. I have eaten here and had dinner to go it always takes forever and it is not cheap I expect cheaper if theres no atmosphere or really good food would make up for it. I have not gotten sick from the sushi here but lets just say I didnt feel so hot after eating here the last time. I looooove sushi and its hard to say that I wont be back here but I'd rather drive a bit farther and skip running the risk.

I probably go here every 6 mos. or so if I'm with a meat eater that is and they have to have In N Out the grilled cheese is consistently good and my kid likes em too, along with the fries that sometimes come w/ a fish taste at no extra charge!! Chocolate shakes are always fun though and most everyone I go with regrets eating the burgers afterwards though they say "Dude that was a good call you had a grilled cheese huhuhuhuuuh I dont feel too great." I'm not big on onions so the animal style stuff doesnt do it for me either sorry folks.   I remember when In N Out came to town GOOD WORD you couldnt even get into the damn place they would have cones up in the parking lot with cops directing traffic. I think its way overrated but they pay the kids that work here more than minimum wage and well the meat eaters need to eat still right!?!

So the first time I go in here ever. It looks nice and clean but looked pretty abandoned inside. Well stocked shelves. I picked up an add and saw a bunch of their makeup was buy one get one free. SCORE!! Especially when the good stuff is $8-$12 at least. So I'm roaming this place for the best deals and finally made my decisions. I went to check out and the High School clerk behind the counter said my total was $38 something. I was like WTF!?!?!?! I was running late to pick up my girl from school so I grunted and paid and went on my way. Well as I knew it when I went home to review my receipt I only got one of the specials. So now I'm pissed because I'm going to have to waste more gas and energy to go back there and correct the situation which I can not stand having to tell people how to do their jobs.   When I went back there was like 10 people waiting in line to check out at this point my courtesy was being tested. I waited patiently with my 6 yr old in tow asking for this and that gummy thing candy spinner the whole time. I get to a cashier and end up returning all this was truly a P.I.T.A. Next time I will just take CVS add to Walgreen's and see what they can do for me you dont even need a frequent buyer card there either. Booooo CVS I boo you very much!!!!

This place does not just have the best ice cream but it is also a full service Green Mountain Coffee Shop! I did not know this! It was free cone day I did not take any pics shame on me, I know right. This location is under new ownership and forgive me I cant recall the owner's name but she was super nice, her family run's it and I got the "inside scoop" on the place hehe. She even let the old man sample the coffee and go back for another scoop! They have a sitting area for kid's complete with tv and they play Disney movies! Score!   I am not a coffee drinker but if I was I'd buy Green Mountain they have Fair Trade & Organic blend's they make diff ones for diff causes and charities I think thats great. I got my little B & J keytag and I will deffinately be back lot's.

Nice sized store, and good option for those claustrophobic types that cant handle Trader Joes, they have a HUGE beer & wine selection too that is a big PLUS for me! They have those sanatizing wipes for the carts I am thankful for those and a free useful nutritional mag with coupons in it they hand out.

I have been blessed in the teeth department I guess. I have never had an Orthodontist before. My dear daughter however has not been so lucky. I blame her father and it's possible my family for skipping a generation w my siblings and I but my child will be needing a little help to get that perfect smile.  The staff was very friendly and put the child at ease from the start. Warning to new patients though they use a digital fingerprint for signing in. While some kids might get excited about it and pretend they are Agent Cody Banks or a Spy Kid of some sort this doesn't bode well with all parents I'm sure. I mean is it really necessary? I'll answer this for you and the answer is a big fat NO. I'd deduct half a star if I could so 4.5 stars more like.  They have special programs for the kids where they earn coins and can buy things w the money. They also have other perks for the kids which I think is really nice. It looks like my little one will be going here for quite some time we'll see if things will stay the same or if the newness of it all will wear out it's welcome.   P.S. They take adult patients as well. Now if I could only mess up my teeth enough to get in a chair and have the hunky doc take a look at my chops.

Yet another Mexican fast food place made popular by people with no taste buds or basic food knowledge. YAY! I should have knowk by the customer base to turn around and walk right back out the door instead of waiting in line. I need to learn to go with my gut more but no I thought I'd give it a chance and people kept annoying me about the tortillas here. They are giant thin and not even fully cooked tortilla's, so what's so good about them again!?!?! The menu here is pretty damn BORING!! Some basic ass Mexican fare which in some parts of the country none of these items even exist! Just a guess but maybe just maybe some of you were high before going up in this Carolina North!?!?   My Ma had a green chile burro it was THE worst ever congrats!! It barely had any meat in it or green chile!!! That's right it was a "green chile" burro made with maybe a teaspoon of actual green chile the rest was basically gravy. Not the good kind either I mean a lot of flour and water mixed in to the sauce that it was not even green it was gray!! GROSS!! A gravy burro doesn't sound too appetizing now does it?!?! The green chile burro gets -1 star here people.   I had the cheese enchiladas w rice and beans. The rice was quite edible not burnt or crunchy but surprisingly fresh tasting and moist. I would eat it again if I had too the beans were not bad either nothing spectacular. Last but not least the cheese enchiladas.....they were good, I ate them and I don't even like red enchilada sauce.   Now if I was in the area of the original location I would probably give it another go for sure. This location not so much however there is a far better Mexican place up the road that serves way better options and ummm real Mexican food and I don't care if it's cheap here either.

What can I do??? I have a child and she like's places that have giant birds, freckled lemonade and free balloons!! Some of the food here blow's of course and some of it is really good. I really like their campfire sauce I have to have some when I come here it taste's like well.....CAMPFIRE you should just try it if you haven't yet you'll see what they mean. The other thing I love here is the chicken tortilla soup minus the chicken. It's really good with a bunch of cheese, kidney beans, corn oh and did I mention cheese!?!? The presentation is pretty and I love it in this cold weather mmmm!  For the adults they have some pretty good drinks including some wine,  Guinness and Blue Moon. I suggest eating light here like no meat but that's just me. Oh they always seems pretty polite and helpful here unlike the Shea/Scotts location but that's another story.

So no one's reviewed this one yet and I just had to make 2 stops here in a single day sheesh! Once for nail polish and some other make up type goodies. Some V8 to make you straight in the morning is always good too. The second visit was for some first aid supplies my brother is so accident prone poor guy. They had just what he needed even finger splints!   The best part about this Walgreen's is the little old lady cashier she is so sweet every time and always says "Come back and visit us again soon" I think that's a rare thing these days!  No alcohol at this location and steer clear of their pharmacy they are a pain to say the least, never enough staff and mistakes galore back there but the rest of the store I heart.

The margs were good for 2 bux they certainly did the trick fa sho!! $2 domestics as well during HH. It was a thurs and HH is from 3-6??? I think. The service was not so great the girl seemed a bit new she had to go "check" to see what the specials were she disappeared for 10+ minutes. Food and drinks took ages but we did endure. They could have dropped a few more $$ into their patio because seriously I dont think its up to code yikes its a really poor attempt if you try to lean on the rail you will see what I mean!!   Wings = NO (prob frozen) Salsa = good Chile Relleno = pretty gosh darn good  ~~~I was thrown a bit because it wasnt breaded and basically all egg white so it was kinda weird but the sauce was soooo HOT you have been warned the green chili is DOPE no fire ass whiners aloud~~~  My paahtna ordered a carne asada burro first it came with mainly onions in it so he asked for one w/out onions, then I guess they thought it'd be funny if they put red peppers all up in it instead. He couldnt handle the heat (he's Italian shhhh) in it but the jokes on them cuz I finished it for him and had no problems. LOL It was good.   Its close and drinks are cheap I'll sit in doors next time!! It would be better if they got a bit more structured with their specials  they ranged anywhere from 2.99 - 8.99 and maybe a bit smaller portions. I'm not really sure what I'd wait through to get some of that green chili sauce though it is BOMB!!!!

Roland stole the words right out of my mouth. We definitely could not think of anywhere else to go this early day Sol y Sombra doesnt open till 5 so this is where we ended up. The menu looked way too diverse and nothing sounding really appetizing. Drinks were ok, my friend had to send back his basic martini due to weakness. I tried a regular Mojito first and it wasn't the best and then a cucumber one that was pretty interesting but nothing fabulous here except for the tv's on the bar side that is. Maybe there is better food choices in the restaurant??? Probably wont be back here unless I am made to!

So my sister says come meet us for drinks! I say OK where to!?!?! Off to Alexi's hmmmm ok I trust you! It was after 7 and dead dead dead in here. The wait staff and bartender were watching baseball I think I'm not so sure so theres like 7 of us thirsty folk we just went to drink so this review is solely based on service pretty much. Nice open patio with no one else being there we were able to be as rowdy as we wanted. I would however like to try their food and see if it is any good. Everyone was very polite and attentive there ended up being 12+ people and they didnt separate the tabs so minus the one star so sorry.

My sister took me here last week its crazy that I haven't been yet right? This is her regular go to place. Not much I can say after so many reviews here already. The patio looked very nice I bet its the place to be when its cooler. It was kind of empty in here but it was late afternoon. My sis ordered us some Drunken Italian Sodas they were made super strong though usually this would not detour me however I had my child with me and had to drive all the way back home after. Basically it tasted like straight vodka in a giant glass it was a bit much for me mid day and after adding Sprite to it which I stole from my daughter I still couldn't drink it without feeling like I'd be a drunken Mexican after. I didn't understand this drink maybe someone can explain it to me? My sis told me their Sangria was good but I had no idea they made Caipirinha's next time that's what I get no question.  The food: We had the garlic lemon hummus it was really good the ingredients separately didn't have much taste to them but together it was really nice the pita bread was excellent. The kid couldn't stop eating the hummus she got so full she barely touched her mac n cheese so we brought that home along w all the leftover hummus. Now on to the Tejano burger we decided to split. OMG it was so delicous I couldn't put it down and we both regretted having split it w each other. Extra star just for that burger alone you best try it if you haven't son!!!

Get your nail's done and yo hair did! My man was told this is where the Coyote player's wives go.....he may have been suckered who knows.  He bought a package deal he does this when he can as it saves brain hemorrhaging near the holidays. It was for a bunch of service's and when I get these thing's I always upgrade everything so I can have the full experience. When I called to make arrangements they said I could not do all services same day. Bummer as I do not live so close =( I booked the massage anyway thinking I'll try the place and if it sucked I wouldn't go back.  I arrive and they ask me if I want water nothing too special. It has more of the salon feel to it rather then a spa as it is not that big. The massage was awesome cant remember the girls name but she did my facial too I even bought some of their product from her wow. My 3rd visit was for hair this is where I got nervous if you look at the price sheet they have 3 levels Skilled, Senor and Master. Well I got a girl with a barbers license?!?! She had to ask the owner a few times about the color. She was really nice and thankfully everything turned out. My last visit on the deal was nails by Christy P it was the most memorable visit, she is a chatty cathy and made me feel comfortable. They have a pedicure room and when I started going that was my fav thing they had a huge massage/spa chair but it broke soon after *sigh* I kept going back for my monthly mani/pedi as long as I could at $60 a pop.  It wasn't cost effective for me to continue going out there paying double what it costs around here plus gas. If you want that whole spa experience where you walk around in a robe and relax and take a swim this isn't the place but I deff recommend them for their salon services they even have perm makeup and detox foot bath's.

This place was THE worst! We were just walking around gambling and these huge dude's with ear pieces kept trying to get us to go to "Their New Lounge" they kept hounding us that there was no cover till midnight to hurry and get in. We finally gave in and saw tons more bouncers waiting with nothing to do. There was an empty red carpet and 0 line we walked in and it was dead we figured it may have some amazing original drinks or some shit. They were out of at least one ingredient from every drink on the menu....coincidence, WTF!! No lemon grass but you can have this shitty as glass of champagne w a cherry in it for $15 YAY!! Then we try to leave we wanted some damn DRINKS like those mile long blended daiquiri were sounding really good to us for the trek back to the Venetian. So the "Manager" was trying to keep us there so badly he said he would go and get us the daq's well we were like ok thats cool I guess but he never returned. This place was TEH GHEY!! I had a better time lighting myself on fire once.

Ok so us 5 hot chix got all dolled up for dinner at City Hall it was about 7 when we arrived on Saturday. The service was top notch from the get go starting with the valet. We were seated by a pleasant hostess in the large main room. Our waiter was an entertaining gentleman, that's one huge plus I have to say about Mastro's is they "usually" have seasoned wait staff they really know their product.  They brought us the great basket of warm breads, we ordered bottled water for all and a bottle of some 06 Sauv Blanc that was mighty tasty. It was impossible to have an empty glass this night!  Everyone had fillet's but me of course, I mainly had apps, side's, wine and desert ;) I did try the seared ahi tuna it was ok I wasn't too impressed with it though. Beefsteak tomato & mozz (see pics) very yummy! The creamed corn, sauteed asparagus and mash were all very good!! I couldn't talk anyone into the lobster mash or any caviar boohoo me. =(  Everyone loved their meal!!  My g/f was coming back from the bathroom and missed a step or something somehow she lost her shoe but there was a busser or someone right behind her he picked it up for her and even put it back on for her! Now that is what I call 5 Star Service!!  We had creme brle they served it with various fresh berries and a huge bowl of their fresh made whip cream yum-gasm's were had all around. While Mastro's is not my top choice since I am not a "Steakhouse kinda girl" it was all good stuff. They always play some  Michael Bubl and who doesn't just love him!?! It was about 3 bills total and we went home with doggy bags and full tummy's.  P.S.  I had their sweet potato fries they were good but I like the ones at Fez better....just sayin. (O_o)

This place was very busy so be prepared or do carryout ;) I had to try the Vodka and Fiorentina after Dallas G.'s review =) It was super yummy just like he said and I'd eat here often if I was a down towner! I am such a sucker for Italian!! Loved it thanks for sharing it Dallas!!!

I think Arik and Eric summed it up pretty well. WOW I was under the impression I never had to pay cover......anywhere.........EVER!! I almost had 30 years of this luck I guess because that streak was broken last night and it was not worth it IMO. I should have stayed at FEZ and followed Thomas & Rickie home. *sigh* Really!?!?! Who's idea was this anyway!?!?! I got poked and prodded like a cow here which I usually dont mind so much but there was definitely attitude here that I dont really care to experience again. I was watching the bartender "Her name was Naomi" let's just say I prob wouldnt order anything but beer here and leave it at that.

I now it's mainly white folks who come out for Cinco but my sister ended up getting the day off and we were hungry, so we started our journey and headed out west! It was about 4:30 when we arrived the parking lot was full I had to park in the next vacant lot but it was because of the party tent's so no biggie. We got seated right away in a nice comfy booth. I love the decor lots of colors not too abnoxious with beautifully painted murals in key places even in the restroom. Restroom had nice stalls with real wood slatted doors you wont have to worry about kids playing peekaboo w/u under the stalls.   Our waiter was really polite and served us very well.  The chip's were really good not greasy or salty + The salsa was super fresh not really spicey (I am Mexican) with a good mixture of cilantro but its like in Sun City so I understand, they brought it out in a carafe which I love but it should still come in a small bowl as well. Trying to get the salsa from a flat plate on to your chips can get frusterating we found ourselves pouring it right on to the chip instead. Was it supposed to come w a bowl maybe, could we have asked for one...probably?!? It was happy hour and we were too excited over the $1 drafts which included Blue Moon you cant beat that. We ordered the guac as an appetizer it came plated nice with diff bigger chips see pic. The guac lacked heat and taste a bit I coudnt detect any limon or cilantro =( so we ended up mixing it w the salsa and ate it that way.   I ordered their  #5 which is a Chile Relleno w a green corn tamale came w beans and rice. The hot plates came out the cheeses were still bubbling. The tamale was GINORMOUS it was as big as my sister's chimi. The tamale was my fav it was moist and the corn was sweet mmm. The rice and beans were excellent the rice was cooked perfectly you could tell it was really fresh again. The chile relleno was pretty good the cheese was all melty but again no real heat.   After getting the bill we proceeded to finish our beers and moved slowly to the party tent. We decided to hang out to avoid the traffic. There was a band that was awesome not only did they play spanish cumbias and some oldies but they played some No Doubt. They had girl dancers/singers. By the end of the night we ended up dancing all in all we had a great time! It was a perfect Cinco specal thanks to Sauza ;)

So I went for Raven's Event mixer thingy so I could bump into Gabi & Dottsy and get some sushi in my tummy. I did not know what this event was but I had a great time I was sad I didnt get to make a late night of it. I cant remember the names of the rolls we had you can thank that Traditional Manhattan I ordered but I thought they were good not THE best but def not THE worst. Our server was excellent the people at this event were surprisingly friendly for Snobbsdale and I suggest the martini's here since this was a martini bar before you cant really go wrong. I left happy and I'll be back!

Good stuff all over, clean and neat my first time at one which my Mother In Law disliked in CA. Go figure! I loved it, it's cheap and good the only gripe I have is their beauty products are like the same as Safeway's I couldn't find anything natural it was all P&G stuff. Oh well that's why there is Sunflower still. Very very helpful everyone was fa sho! My mistake I only had my checks on me they DO NOT take checks I repeat NO CHECKS no biggie the young male cashier said he could save the transaction and put my 2 carts of groceries in the cooler whilst I ran home to get my debit card, coolness. Damn being a girl and having to change purses!! Any way I got back w my card and the young cashier could not figure out how to get back into my transaction, 20 minutes and a few managers tried it as well but they ended up having to re-ring everything. Sorry Fresh & Easy!! They were so nice and gave me 2 bundles of flowers and one of their canvas totes for the hassle!! Very generous as I am pretty patient with human's and technology. None the less I left very happy and will return in the near future. Everything was super I cant decide my fav dept was!! The sample booth ruled, I like their pre-sliced lunch meat has re-usable tubs, the produce and florals were beautiful and their brand Tortilla soup is awesome!!

Me and my sis were greeted with a pleasant smile and I like the whole $5 part with the coke and fries. I dont really enjoy drinking soda but I'll take it anyway especially if its fruity, they have all the old school pop in cans Shasta and RC I should learn to take more pics but this place is cramped inside and I may be claustrophobic. I had the portabello mushroom burger see pic it had rice and all this other stuff that just kinda fell out all over the place it was super messy but pretty tasty. The fries are soggy which ordinarily we wouldnt eat but they were really good we couldnt stop eating them. We sat on the back patio and got checked on by I am assuming was the owner she asked how we liked it, was way nice I love the friendliness of the place we left hekka full and happy! Next time we go we will probably just share an order of fries though.

I have been eying this place for awhile now and finally had the pleasure of eating here this Saturday. They just started a Happy Hour last month yay perfect timing got there at exactly 3 pm it goes on till 6. It was my sis in law's b-day and the staff was cheerful as we took up the whole sushi bar with the 6 of us. They must have just opened their door's as no one else was there yet. Talking to the su chef's we learned Yen Sushi comes from LA, they have 4 location's out there they look even better than this place very very nice you'd think you were in Scottsdale based on the decor. What this place is doing on the same corner as a Subway!?! I have no idea!   Beautiful presentation and the sushi satisfied everyone's craving's! We had sushi mainly see crappy phone pics sorry I had to borrow my brothers crappy phone. I didn't care for the veggie sampler too much I was disappointed it didnt look like the picture and wasnt too appetizing the flavors just did not work for me, but other than that everything was grrrreat! They even brought the bday girl a huge green tea sundae, she absolutely loved it and it was way better than most places that give you cut up oranges. They said this place is hopping at night and we picked a good time to come before the dinner rush. People started to trickle in just before we left. I cant wait to go back soon and try some more yummy goodness I am very happy with my find!

Me and my daughter were cruising around when I found this place. I was expecting just a deli for lunch but we walked in and to my surprise it is also had a full diner and a wine bar room along with the market and deli counter to boot! We sat down for lunch I was not expecting the niceness of it at all. There were TVs and lot's of sport's memorabilia. The staff was very courteous and knowledgeable it is family owned and they were very welcoming. I just ordered a Veggie sandwich all sandwiches come with your choice of potato or veggie salad or chips. I went with the potato it was delicious not your avg potato salad at all! It had peas and grated carrots in it and was yellow in color see pics* They didn't really have a kid type menu but they did their best they made her chicken finger's, all their meat's are all natural too! +++ There was not anyone else in the front dining room so I got to chat with the man a bit he said they have been there 2 years I came at a slow time late afternoon after lunch rush which was great we had the whole place to ourselves. He said they have wine tasting on Thurs. night's and Fri. is Poker night which I will surely be returning for asap! Turned out we had the same exact car color and all I don't take coincidences lightly lol! I cant wait to go there for a good dinner and minus a child next time.  See their extensive menu of imported beer and wine! It is hiding behind the Goodwill a happy find for sure!

Tried this place because uh'hem it was reccomended. (Thanks Sarah) lol! We ordered take out the first time it was the worst ever looked like stuff fell on the floor. My kid had the roadies or w/e they were supposed to be like slider's there was 2 missing the meat! So we call to see what's up maybe they had an off night. The gm wanted to send us a gc for the meal ok....weeks go by we call her, again she apologizes. We finally get them and she had sent like 3x the original amount. YAY!  We decide to take some friends with us since it was FREE. Well once again it was pretty gross no one really ate much, 2 people got their filets they ended up well done. One was sent back and re-made. It ended up the same. They basically said if its later evening thats what your going to get no matter how you order them. The service is not so good and that makes 6 people never going there again, it's ok by me cuz I hate chain's. Will people ever learn chai's suck!?!? This place should not even get 1 star the best thing is the bucket's of peanut's. My daughter loved throwing the shells on the ground, I mean where else can your kid's do that on purpose?

Ok so they had their grand opening and we hung out at The Norterra Shops all day. I have been waiting for this place to open to take the kid. I am not going to lie we went there 3 times I still didnt try all the flavors I had peanut butter creme, raspberry creme, and watermelon ice along w tasting a handful of other flavors every visit. My tongue is back to normal but I dont suggest eating there 3 times in one day I think my tongue had frost bite. But I will be back for more soon they make smoothies and a bunch of other stuff I had never been to an actual store before the staff was really nice too no matter how many things we tried or how many times I came in lol.

I dont think I will stop coming here the staff is really nice every time! Even when my kiddo decides to spill an entire root beer float all over their nice floor. If you go to the movies across the way I suggest going here first instead of spending an arm and a leg on drinks. They make custom ice cream cakes, they have sundaes, fresh fruit smoothies, vitamin water, soda, tea and they even have energy drinks like red bull. They have topping's, waffle's and cone's just like any other ice cream shop too.

Ok so as a veg this place isnt too great to eat but the frozen custard HELLO mmm mmmm mmmmm!! You can have it any way you want it and that my fellow Yelper's, gives this girl some much needed pleasure ;)!! The staff is so frign delightful here I thought I walked into another dimension with all the politeness that was being dished out at such high doses. This is may be the best fast food place to hit the valley.   I had the Avocado Pecan Bleu Salad w the ras. vinaigrette see pic. It was a perfect dinner for me last night and then topped it off with a caramel CASHEW sundae. Cashew's?!?!?! Are you serious.....wow!! Go here like NOW!!  P.S. Thanks to Greg for recommending!!  *I cant find my picture lol*

So it's been YEARS since I have been to a Paradise Bakery! Working at the mall will do that to you. Stopped in Sunday for some shopping fuel with my mom & sis. I had the sour dough bread bowl w the fire roasted tomato soup they also had posole which I thought was interesting. Mom and sis had sandwiches chicken walnut and the albacore.   I had never been to a stand alone PBC before it was a little chaotic maybe because it was Mothers Day and the line was out the door?! They had their bottled water ads out and proceeds go to Free Arts of AZ http://www.freeartsaz.org/ just so happens to be my FAV charity they only had a small basket full and they were warm not on ice, the cashier suggested the cold Dasani water instead eh we drank it warm anyway then went down to Paciugo to cool off.  All in all I am glad we are getting some healthier chains up here as opposed to the Olive Garden, Applbee's, TGIF, Logans accross the street I will be back!

I didn't see half of any particularly interesting flavors I thought this place was going to be special first one in AZ and all! Their aren't any in CA either. Maybe my expectation's are too high?!?! Their website had me checking daily to see if they were open, they were a month late on their announced opening. They cater which is cool. You can mix flavors of course. I had cookie dough its so my weakness it was good I didn't have an "O" moment or anything. The staff was friendly and you can taste your heart out. It will be my duty to go back and have the Tiramis next time but Paciugo you let me down and now I frown. Maybe you cater these better flavors???

Oh Sandbar I am sooooo confused. Do people come here to eat, drink, or dance?!?!?! It was Saturday night, the line was wrapped around the building which is a joke because you do not want to WAIT to be in this place!!! Security everywhere and cops in the parking lot just waiting for someone to get rowdy. Very welcoming as if the President were here with the Secret Service!?!? I did not want to wait!! Where theres a will, theres a way!! We walked up to the VIP line (Yes theres a VIP line at a "Mexican Grill") they let our group right in it helps if your group is no males and cute girls of course ;) No cover for ladies thank god I'd never pay to come here!!  So we get in and head for the bar theres a wait of course!! We get our first round and look for a place to get comfy for the night. We got lucky and found a large dirty table in the corner where we could watch everyone from afar. We also got the cute waitress that didnt know how to clean tables go figure.   Do not try to get on the dance floor here it is the dumbest thing you can do unless you want to feel like a sardine in a can, then by all means dont let me stop you!! The music I must say is ghetto fabulous with all the rap and I can not count how many times I saw the Pussycat Dolls on the screen. Great dancing music if say this were in fact a dance club!?!?   The grill smell I had to endure all night and bring home with me on my clothes does have me curious about the food here so I will return but only during the day when this place is not cluttered with security and is somewhat less amusing to my senses.

This place always makes me happy. Way better than any BofA or Wells Fargo ever made me feel. They actually get to know you and I have only been with them for 8 mos. I think I can safely say that I will never put my money in a bigger type bank ever again! The only thing that I havent been happy with here was their Auto Center but you can still go to any car dealer and get a loan thru them so I solved my problem. If your still banking at Chase or Wamu I highly suggest a switch you'll never be happier.

Yay finally one in my neck of the woods I am happy! I was like a kid in a candy store, a great new place to buy my Metro Mint water and KEGS all while earning points!! They did not have creme brulee cigars ='( but I imagine this is as close to an alcoholics dream as you could get. I cant wait to buy a giant bottle of Patron for decoration. Pinch me!!

Brand spankin' new chain food! This place is a tad different than the other ones around you wont find the giant horses out front here and its a very open layout inside with giant light fixtures that look like drums hanging from above. Its a good thing we don't have to worry about earthquakes here folks! The hostess was totally pleasant I wish I were young and enjoyed my job as much. Our waiter was excellent he knew his shit. My sister and I started off with their white pear Mojitos they could have been stronger but they weren't overly sweet and quite refreshing. We didn't have to replace the drink with water during the meal so we just kept the Mojitos flowing. We started w the seared ahi tuna I didn't care for the peanutty wasabi sauce that came on it next time I'd get it on the side it definitely had a kick to it. I had the Buddha's Feast, fried it was nothing special I probably wont order that again I could easily make that at home, the Shanghai Cucumbers were good like always. My sister had the orange peel chicken and was told by the waiter to eat the peels w the chicken she loved it and we both had leftovers to bring home at the end.  They had $2 desert cups we had the strawberry shortcake and banana split both were very rich and tasty. We left very full and happy for our Sunday treat.

I had to make an emergency pit stop here for some shoelaces my dog decided to eat. I was determined to not go to Wally World so I popped in real quick between dance class. I usually cant stand dollar stores they are what they are kwim. This store was actually super organized to my surprise I didnt mind being there and even looked around a bit. I even saw employees helping people and being friendly. All in all I would go back here if I needed.

So I have been frequenting this shopping center since they started slowly opening a few places at a time a few months ago. This center is looking to be the creme de la creme of North PHX shopping and dining. Its better than across the street on the South side (Applebee's, Olive Garden and the worst offender Logans Roadhouse bleh!) Yes there are chains over here too but what can you do?? With the only Paciugo Gelato in AZ I cant complain! Check my Norterra list for a feel of some things you will find here. There are still quite a few places left to open like Ah-So for sushi and Miami Rice Pudding! It's definitely the best stuff we have seen up around these parts!!!

Been here one too many times now. It's a nice new Best Buy let's just hope you never have to do a price adjustment or have any returns for their  customer service department. It's run by pimply twits that you just may want to strangle or tell them how to do their job. If you do anything computer related ask for the business person he knows a thing or two. Everything else I think you are pretty much on your own I have not used their Geek Squad here yet.

I have been going here for years it does not smell I have no qualm's with this theater the IMAX thing is cool but pricey I feel bad for people with multiple children. You can get valet here on the weekend's which is a plus mainly because parking blows in this shopping center. The chairs do not lounge bad for a long movie, but you can put your armrest up and take a nap if the movie sux here.

Went to see the Chihuahua movie this weekend with my little one and her cousin. $5.75 per child meal which is a small popcorn, soda, and a lame ass treat. My kid dropped the whole thing before we could sit down....CRAP....well they came and cleaned it up and  GAVE her another one for free I thought that was pretty cool when they charge you $2 for more cheese for your nachos. They did right.

This place is dope if you have children. I took my niece for a late lunch yesterday and they were really cheery and nice at the beginning before they got a tad busier then it was a little hard to order anything else from the server I think she was alone the managers didnt seem to be doing much. The server was very helpful they even give you nickels for the juke. I had a grilled cheese on sourdough with fries it did the trick. I like Johnny Rockets, for first timers its even better I like to see kids happy faces.

I was pretty surprised at this place it was super comfy. People were slow dancing when we popped in here to meet Arik B. around 11:30, the bar was full but there was plenty of room everywhere else. The bathroom was super cool and spacious but they really could have fit 2 stalls in there. The bartenders were good looking and I really like the beer selection I would def hang here if I was in walking distance. The music could use some tweaking as it was pretty damn random and I cant even explain it you just have to go see for yourself. FYI I would not want to wear heels here, get tipsy and have a go at the stairs.

Had to jump in for beauty supplies next door w me mum so the outside of this place really caught my eye! We decided to stop for a bite. It was a late lunch maybe 4 tables were occupied the place felt a tad small inside so we opted to have the patio all to ourselves. Waiter was nice and helpful. I ordered the Pad Thai w shrimp and my mom did the red curry. The shrimp were a nice plump size they were cooked perfectly, I wish there would have been more shrimp on the plate but ce est lavie. The veggies were nice and fresh I thought it was very flavorful compared to other places I've tried Thai food. Not too many places have even left an impression on me the food is usually pretty bland. I tried my moms red curry and it was delicous. The Thai Tea was awesome I wish I had one right now. It was good I will return!

This used to be Beautiful Nails.  Thanks to my Sister in law (S.I.L.) I would have never known it changed ownership. The spa chairs rock! Seriously I have not seen spa chairs this nice...EVER...not even in Scottsdale shhhhh. They are like TEH ultimate primo massage pedi chairs of all the land. My S.I.L. has been raving about them for awhile now and I was pretty damn curious. We went in for pedi's without an appointment around 11:30 or so yesterday. We were seated right away after picking our colors but we got lucky because right after we got comfy 3 more pedis walked in the door and they had to soak and wait. The unbelievable chairs were now all full!    Even though they now had more customers to work on we were still handled properly and with care. I didn't feel as if they were rushing us at any point. That is a huge pet peeve of mine especially if you have an appointment somewhere and they get slammed and rush to get you out the door I HATE that!! The new owners are very nice and they were chatting and keeping ALL the customer's very happy.   We just got normal spa pedi's here but it was a hekka lot more than anywhere I've been for  the price. You cant beat it in this recession really. I'm talking better than Snobsdale $60+ pedi's and hunny I've been everywhere!! They had the same citrus scrub here and hot towels the killer bonus at no extra charge other than the chairs of course was that they did a hot rock massage too. My senses were on feel good overload.   No they did not have free fruit, tea, or water with lemon and orange slices in it but who cares!?!? Between the awesome job they did on my pedi and what the chair did for my back I just have one word for you....HEAVEN. I feel a polish change coming on and this place gets an all over body Yumgasm!! They just need to add Aqua Detox and they'd totally be set!!

Sorry but once again I don't get it. This is a nice place, salsa out of pumps....oh you fancy huh. This is within walking distance from the new pad. I went against my better judgement.....kicking and screaming mind you. Decided to give this place another go or 5....maybe this location is better? The first time we tried it they were closed, the second time we barely made it. No carne asada? No chile relleno? Why God why must you toy with me?!?!? This place is NOT the best place.....the green sauce isn't green at all it's GREY people!!! You know what makes it that color? Flour.....more like gravy. You like the tortillas I could care less really its a super large thin tortilla there's nothing special about it. CALM DOWN. The kid behind the counter tells me to try the breakfast thats their specialty. My 3rd Carolinas attempt was for breakfast and once again I was very underwhelmed. I have tried basically everything on the menu all this stuff is pretty basic and a major let down. The rice and beans are good fyi.

New small locally owned full service car wash. You can get your car washed for as cheap as 7.99! You can give them your keys and let them run it through or do it the old fashioned way and drive it through yourself with the kids in the back. Kid's love that!! Their regular hand wash is just 11.99 you really cant beat that. There's not 40 dude's bum rushing your for 10 different things when you pull in. A giant plus when you just want a frign car wash if you ask me!! There is a bigger one just down the street they are opening soon I plan on returning.

This place is open till 3 and I barely made it in time the other day. I was hungry for some lunch and tried their roasted Veggie wrap. They sell Boar's Head by the pound here for all you meat lovers out there. While the inside of the wrap was a good veggie assortment it did not taste roasted and the tortilla did not seem to be cooked either. It got super doughy half way through, it was however a ginormous wrap that was piping hot for well over 20 minutes later. Next time I will come earlier in the day maybe that will be better I still want to try everything else here it was clean and about $6 for the wrap, chips, and a fountain drink. They also had coffee and a large assortment of tea bags along with a cooler chalk full of red bulls and Pepsi type products. Bagels & Lox I am so there again!

Ok let me try this again. This is no longer the same Roberto's that was featured on Food Network. It is def under new management and/or ownership. If you go to robertosaz.com it only has the Anthem location listed and that actually explains everything to me. The staff here is not friendly and there is no one from the old crew here anymore its been like this for awhile now maybe almost a year. I kept coming back thinking that maybe with the changes eventually stuff would work itself out and get back to normal. That didnt happen here and I gave the place many many chances. It really makes me sad after going here for like a decade knowing it wasn't the same I still kept coming back here. You know what they say old habits die hard!?! They really do I was like a kid that kept going back to that mean dog and pulling its tail over and over again while ending up bit every damn time!   This was the last straw for me last night. I always order the same thing here...again creature of habit. They have tried this before but they usually work with me this time the cashier tried to nickel and dime me where I ended up with a $10 burrito!! Are you fucking kidding me here!?!?! The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced. I'm looking for a new place now I learned my lesson and wont waste any more time on this place getting mediocre food!

If you have never been to an aquarium in your lifetime and have possibly been landlocked in this desert state I'd say go.   If you have toddlers or children up to age 5 I'd say go.  Fish dissection was the best part the teachers were very knowledgeable the rest of the workers lacked basic social skills. I would never ever pay full price for this place not even on a good day. Cool dino fish and shark exhibit, jellies were neat, the walk through aquarium was ok but the floor underneath is completely scratched you cant see anything a bad design choice I'm guessing.  Aquariums are so tiny I feel bad for these fish they are all saying HELP ME!! You could basically stick your hand in any of these if your over 4 ft and touch the poor fishies, which is probably a really bad thing!!  My 10 yr old took a whole 10 minutes to go through the entire thing they said your pass is good ALL day, considering we couldn't get out of here fast enough ummmm def not worth a trip from the other side of town just for this def not a tourist attraction I'd rather watch reruns of Tanked from the comfort of my layz boy.

Keep in mind I'm a Scottsdale brat here. Went here with a pretty large homeschool group with kids of all ages. Convenient ATM and Mexican restaurant connected to the place. I however did not try the food. It was a weekday afternoon with only one person working the entire place and it seemed pretty busy besides our group there were plenty of other bowlers. Since their was only one person setting up games, handing out shoes, making change. It seemed like forever just to get something, I didn't dare order a drink or anything here, and mainly everyone stuck to the vending machines. The bowling part was fine though, maybe it's better at night or weekends? I'd hope they have more people running the place. Considering there was A LOT of us it did go pretty well but I think one extra set of hands would have been that much better for the experience. While this place is out of the way from where I live if I was in the area at night on a full moon I might stumble in here once more.
