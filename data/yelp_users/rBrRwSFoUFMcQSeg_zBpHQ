The dental office is great although the reason for my low review is the office manager. She makes the place feel really unwelcoming. Otherwise had a good experience. I liked the previous office manager she had a great attitude too bad she left.

I visited this doctors office earlier this year. I have no problem with the service and only the service that was provided by the doctor himself during my initial visit. Be VERY CAUTIOUS about this doctors office because they will lie to you and charge you HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS more than they promised. My issue at first was with the office staff. The receptionist informed me that the test would cost a couple hundred dollars which I paid before my initial meeting with the doctor. I was then surprised a month later when I saw the doctors office billed me and my insurance for more then what was originally stated. When I called to find out what happened instead of being understanding the office manager basically stated that it was my problem. She also stated I have the right to not pay and that my insurance company will send me to collections (which is a lie I even confirmed with my insurance company). I insisted that I would like to come to a resolution with a meeting with the doctor. After being persistent I finally was able to meet with the doctor and the office manager. The doctor made it clear that he had no interest in talking to me. We eventually agreed that we would resolve this by me paying half the additional bill. I informed both that I can pay that day and they insisted that I wait. We set up another appointment to make the payment. At this time Barbara, the office manager, stated to me that the only way they can do half is if I lied on a legal document stating I have a hardship. They had me between a rock and a hard place since this was a day before my bill was due and if I didn't pay on time I knew they wouldn't hesitate to send me to collections so I had to pay whatever they requested to save my credit. The condescending and rude behavior along with constant lying by the office manager and the doctor is what caused me to leave this one star review. I can promise you that this office will make sure that you get ripped off and you will be lied to. The reviews don't lie; he has a low review everywhere for this reason. I should have looked at reviews before visiting this office. Overall if I knew that I was going to be stuck with a bill for $500 for this basic test I would have reconsidered. In the future, I know I will never make the mistake of not checking a doctors review first.

The place was great unfortunately when they bring on new staff it can go south quickly. I have been going to this place for a couple years now and there's this one person who is not friendly at all. Last time I ordered from him he just seemed like he didn't want to be there and it didn't surprise me the same happened this time. I ordered my usual what I have ordered for the last two years and as soon as I saw him make the shake I mentioned to him that it doesn't look right. He said this is how it's supposed to be made and gave me terrible attitude like I was wrong and was intruding on his time. I tried the shake and it tasted horrible. He hesitantly asked me if I wanted something else I said yes please if that how this shake is and asked for a recommendation to which this young man said everything is good. He wasn't helpful at all; I got another shake and it tastes terrible as well but I walked away with it. I am not paying $8 for a terrible shake that I am going to throw away and also deal with someone's negative attitude.

Regina did a great job handling the negative situation. I appreciate fact that she took the time to talk to me and addressed my concern. This definitely prompted me to amend my rating for this business.

Great ambience and the service is great as well. The issue I have is with their food and drinks though. The food unfortunately is no where close to Chicago style and unfortunately misses the Chicago aspect of having something for everyone. We asked for a vegetarian deep disk pizza and were unable to accommodate that since all they have is meat sauce. There food and drinks are unfortunately mediocre at best and they do not serve desert. They did have a live dj on Saturday night although the place seemed like a ghost town. I would not seek to venture into this place until they revamp the menu.
