I have been here twice.  The food is OK, nothing special but not bad.  I have had pizzas and salads and they were as described but nothing to write home about.  My main gripe about this place is the service.  It has been slow and innattentive on both occasions.  On the latest visit the place was half empty but there was a 10-15 minute wait?  While we stood there, two customers came up to the hostess asking her to take their money as their servers had disappeared.  I like  the Arizona Center but try My Big Fat Greek Restaurant... Plenty of staff, great outside seating and a much more pleasant experience.

I have been a patient of Dr Dedinsky for over 3 years now.  I really like the time he takes during physicals and visits.  He is thorough and practical in his approach.  His office staff are competent, pleasant and efficient!

We had breakfast here today and it was very good.  We had the Lox and bagel plate which had a generous portion of Nova Lox and plenty of condiments.  we also had the Greek Omelet which was very tasty and had a nice proprotion of veggies to eggs.  Service is attentive and friendly - a nice find

L'Amore is a great hidden gem.  The restaurant has a cozy feel and the service is outstanding.  The dishes served offer a great variety and are not just the usual italian fare  (though they do have many of the classics).  The often have some live music that adds to the ambience.

Having a picture session with Kay is a fun relaxing experience.   She has a natural talent for bringing out the personalities of her subjects.   She can create a large variety of environments in her comfortable studio or come to your venue.  The final product is top notch!

The Flamingo Palce has really good (non-chain) Chinese food.  I like the MuShu chicken and their orange beef.  The hot and sour soup is excellent as well.    The portions are generous and the service is prompt and efficient.  The decor is well, Chinese Restaurant! but there are tablecloths and the seating is comfortable.  They have good lunch specials for the $ but I like going for dinner as the menu has way more than the lunch items to explore.

This place used to be a favorite but the quality continues to deteriorate.  It appears there are new owners.    The buffet items are overly greasy and spiced oddly.  Last time I was in not one staff person there even said a word to us.  It was weird!

I like Malees and it is one of the better spots at Desert Ridge.  I have eaten in the main room and the sushi  bar with equal success.  I like the straight sushi best and their sampler is nice.  Their rolls are over sauced and hard to taste any fish.   The Thai dishes are all good, I like the Shrimp Satay.     Another good thing is that the portions are reasonable.

I have 5 nieces and nephews and Kidstop always has high quality, fun toys that you don't find at the mega mart.  The staff are always helpful in locating just the right toy for the occasion.  I never have to worry about finding something.  I always walk away with a smile.

Just stopped in again for a gift for my niece - did not have a lot of time but the staff found several great options and wrapped one beautifully - All I had to do was show up at the birthday party !  It's always a pleasure shopping here - makes me want to be a kid again!

We had a great meal at this place.  the owner is a passionate and enthuisiastic chef and it shows in his cooking.  We ordered 4 different dishes and an appetizer and all we great.    The Shrimp faranghe is grilled shrimp wrapped in grilled eggplant.  It was excellent.  Antoher ordered the Spinch Herb burger (vegitarian) and it cam on a bed of rice with a huge garden salad that was nicely seasoned with fresh herbs.  A third had the grilled Salmon that was also served with a salad and nicely spiced.  Last we have the kaboodie and it came with grilled vegetables.  Everything was fresh, well seasoned and scrumptious.    this is not a kebab and fries kind of place so expect fresh twists on your persian food.  We would defintley go back

Visited for the first time this week.  Smallish place but welcomign and comfortable.  Has dart area and several TVs, high and low tables as well as bar seating.  It's a little hard to find in the center but it's therere on the SWC of McDowell and Scottsdale Rd  Really enjoyed the beer selection - about 20 bears on tap and dozens in bottles.  They really have a great selection.    We tried the hot pretzels, smoked jalapeno salsa, thai chicken and muffleta pizzas... All we very good.  The place was packed on a Thursday evening but we had great service.

This place is a Phoenix gem.  The food is a great fusion of chinese and mexican.  They serve it up is an amazing array of  combinations.    Make you you get some of the samples that are always being offered.  Things to try: Jade Red Chicken, Pollo Diablo (this one is great in a quesadilla, Machaca (in a burrito), and the Jerk Chicken.  For sides thing outside of the box and get the black beans and jerk fried rice.  And of course, their snickerdoodles make a great finish.....

I have been to yard house for business meetings, family outings and with colleagues for a beer.  They do have an astonishing array of beers on tap.  It is fun to seek out ones from Europe that you rarely find here even in bottles.  On to the food...  I like the food an variety here.  I have eaten from the appetizer menu only, had sandwiches, pizza and salads.  I can recoomend the Poke Stack, the Koren Ribs, and the eggrolls.  The Ahi salad is also excellent.  Try the french dip for more mainstream fare.  It gets busy on weekends but weekdays it is easy to get a seat.  They also do an ecellent tea service in a real pot and they have some non typical selections.

This is a small family run Sushi place.  It is similar to many small place found throughout Japan.  The Sushi is fresh and excellent.  All of the standards are there.   I have also tried the Salmon Toro which was a treat.  The Temprua, Gyozas and noodle dishes are also excellent.  It closes 2-5 and fills quickly at 5.   If you have a group of more than 4 it will be tight!

Bruce and his crew do an outstanding job of delivering great food and service.  I have hired Bruce and attended many events he has catered and they all have been perfect.  When he does events at your house, he'll leave it cleaner than when he arrived.  Superb!

I have visited Soma on numerous occasions.  I have tried many different things and founf them all tasty.  I like that they go easy on the things that make most restaurant food unhelthy.   There is lonly light use of oil, cheeses and creamy sauces.    I have recently tried them for breakfast.  I have had their oatmeal with fruit, pancakes, and omelet.  The oatmeeal is the best followed by the pancakes.   The omelet was a little dry but I prefer that to swimming in grease!

Market Bistro is a great place for lunch.  The have a "create your own" salad that is like a salad bar except with really fresh and  unique ingredients.  You choose up to 7 and they tooss it for you. Try the house Balsamic... is os fantastic.   You can top you salad with pesto chicken, marinated tri-tip etc.   If salad is not you thing they make excellent sandwiches and pizzas to order.  You can sit inside or outside.  The only downside is that it can get busy at lunch time but just get there a little early!

Finally go in here after all the great feedback i have heard.  The food was good.  We split a bento and a few pieces of sushi on the side.   the fish was all very fresh and nicely presented.  Service was spiffy.  The special board has lots on it which we did not explore onthis visit but will on a next visit.  Prices are towards the higfher end for the sushi/sashimi but there are also a lot of other great japanese dishes on the menu.  Would be fine to take a non-fish person there.  One minor complaint was the tea.  A place like this should have decent tea, they served us a grocery grade oolong that was not very good and took away from the experience.

This is a great Greek restaurant tucked away in a large strip mall at 7th street and Greenway.  They food is always good.  Try the Chicken Kabobs or the Chicken Gyro for a nice change.  The usual Greek fare is also good.  The hummus is just right and the falafel is a great appetizer.  The service is always attentive but the place does get busy at times.  There is also a nice seating patio that is shaded.  They do a nice take away business that is very convenient if you call ahead!

I used to really like this place but it has changed hands and the service has plummeted.  Visited last week and our server could not have showed any more contempt for her customers.  The senior person was chatting up two friends at the bar and ignoring the 2 whole tables occupied.    Afte slapping our food down our server went outside to smoke a couple cigarettes not returning until we were finished with two empty wine and water glasses.  It's a shame, I used to like seeing the owner here, he was a engaging attentive soul who kept his staff on task...  Maybe use it for take out??

Basis hits on all cylinders.  The food is outstanding and that is coupled with perfect service every time.  From the appetizers to the salads and entrees every dish is appealing to the eye and the palate.  I especially like Basis at lunch where one can have a tasty, reasonable and unhurried lunch without the din experienced at most lunch spots.  Basis has a nice selection of wines by the glass and on Tuesday evenings all wine by the glass is half price.  For attention to detail, great food, and impeccable service Basis is a great choice.

Basis is a great place for lunch or dinner combining innovative food, excellent service, and a perfect atmosphere for conversation.  I have eaten eaverything from thier fish sandwich (grilled and a nice lunch bite) to their more elaborate dinnerfare steaks, lamb, etc  they always have some great specials and a decent by the glass wine list  It's in a strip center that hides its qualities but don't let that scare you away!

The guys at Community Tire always do a great job at a fair price.  They work with you on what's needed and how much it should cost.  The waitng room is great, the staff friendly, and the quality top-notch.  My son just picked up a new set of tires for his car and he got a great price on his tires.  The stadn behind their work and always go the extra mile.

We tried Wild Tuna's recently.   I can't say that I would go back as the pices are high, the sushi is just OK, and the amibience and service are sub par.  Likes:   The Green Eggs and Ham roll had a nice bite to it and I liked it  Dislikes:  The sushi.  The choices are very limited, the portions are very small for the price, and the presentation is poor.  The spider roll was not as good as others in the area, too oily for my taste.  Beverages:  Although it has the word spirits in it's name don't expect too much.  They carry only one "Japanese" beer Asahi which is made by Miller in the US.  There is no menu for Sake so you have to just order it with no idea on what it is or what it will cost.  Even the non-alcoholic choices are poor.  If you order tea (usually pretty good in most sushi restaurants) you'll get a crappy teabag in a large stainless steel pot producing a poor excuse for a cup of tea.  Bottom line:  If you like Sushi, go elsewhere, you will spend less money, get better food, and have a more positive experience

I have been to this place 4 times, all for the buffet and all were good.  Their Tandoori is decent, they always have some varied vegetable selections and the Tikka is pretty good for a buffet.  They have a varied selection and the staff are always friendly and helpful  I like that you can get garlic naan with the buffet.  I have nto yet ordered off the menu there....

Authentic asada in a great setting.  This is a great place to grab a great carne asada.  We went in the evening around 8 and had a burrito, tostada and bean burrito between us.  Everything was good and fresh.    The ambience is nice with lots of outside seating.    I understand this place gets busy at lunch and even at 8pm there was a short queue!

We tried this place for the first time this week after hearing about from several folks...   The lunch was $35 for two with only one drink inclusive of tip and you should not expect gargantuan portions...  What I liked: - Excellent, fresh food served in a healthy fashion - Reasonable portions - Great service even during the lunch rush  We tried the Ahi Sliders - nice wasabi and good crunch, the roasted asparagus - just rights and perfectly seasoned, The "TLT" - good sized sandwich, I recommend it with the avocado, and the Kale Salad - OK but it needed a little more zip  What I did not like:  - Really noisy, I can't recommned this place for a quiet lunch... it is pretty hard to carry on a conversation even when seated side by side

We visited Tuck with a group of 9 recently.  We ate mostly the small plates and enjoyed everything.  We sampled the dates stuffed wtih chorizo, oyster popover sliders, roasted garlic, spinach salad and mac 'n cheese.   All were tasty and nicely presented.  The place it self is cozy and comfortable with more elbow room then other downtown establsihments.  The service was friendly and efficient.  The noise levels allowed for covnersation without straining.  I would definitely go back there to try some entrees or again with a group

We stopped in for breakfast today before shopping the PHoenix Public Market.  Nice breakfast selection and their whole menu is also available.  In our party we have the pancakes which were light and fluffy, the French toast (6 generous slices), a combo with eggs, and a Turnkey wrap.   It has a nice shaded patio in the AM that was very pleasant.  Other plusses  - it is a big place and there in no waiting  - it is close to the light rail - it is 50 yeards from the public market  Will have to go back for a beer and to try the corned beef quesadillas (Irish/Mexican fusion?) - it looks like a great pub!

U.S Egg recently opened in the space where "Blue Plate Brunchery" had been....  Same menu as their other locations.  We had the Veggie Benedict, Breakfast Burrito, Biscuits and gravy, and the fruit platter...  they have just opened but everythign was good and the service was attentive.  Only complaint was that teh potatoes were undercooked, but I am not a big fan so it was no biggie...

Visited today for lunch - I like vietnamese food but it is hard to find on this side of town.  I had the standard vermicelli bowl with beef/pork.  I found it tasty and agree their spicing is a bit under stated.  Nice array of condiments provided so one can dial in the exact taste they desire.  Service was prompt and courteous - an overall postivie experience.  One plus - they know how to make tea!  served loose in the pot, a nice house blend with some aromatics.  The menu is a bit impenetrable and the pictures somewhat random - some better descriptors would be good

Had another great visit to Royal Coffee...  Makes a great stop while shopping the Phoenix Public Market.  Hayes has great coffee and serves it up quickly, even when it's busy.  I like the location and the area... Royal Coffee makes a perfect base to explore the market and beyond.

Worked with Sonoran studios on a professional profile video.  There are extremely professional, respectful of your time, and, most importantly, produce a great product.  They provided the video in several formats for use in a variety of outputs. I would use them again for my professional video needs.

Liked this place when it was Bombero's and like the  reincarnation even better.  The outside area is one on the better al fresco spots on the North side of town.  I have been twice recently and had great food both times - First itme, everyone ordered their own thing and the second we just noshed on flatbread, pizza, spinach dip etc.  Nice happy hour from until 6 $5 vino and some discounted apps.  Service has been fine both times, on of the visits they had 4 or five large parties but stayed on top of things with only minor delays.

Had an unsatisfactory experience here.  Stopped by about 5pm for drinks and a bite before a show.  Waited for about 5 minutes but the two servers were unable to get to our table.   Ordered drinks at the bar.   After awhile, an indifferent server did ask if we needed anything.   We ordered some food and it arrived shortly after that.  As she set down the food, the server informed us there was a private event starting in 15 minutes and we had to vacate by then.  Would have been great to have so e signage or forwarning prior to ordering.  we go to scarf our dinner as furniture was being moved all around us.  asked to see a manager, it took "Zack"  10 minutes to arrive.  From his behavior, it is easy to see where the I different service style comes from.  He indicated the "they" had neglected to put signage out for the event but offered nothing beyond that than an apology.  Food was OK, nothing special.  Views are nice, but I would not go back.  Hard to believe this is a Kempton property.

Visited for first time during their happy hour.  Tried some stuff on happy hour and off.  I like my sushi and avoid most rolls.  The Nigiri was good.  Tuna was a little pbland but the salmon, yellow tail and snapper made up for it.  Great deals on their happy hour (4p-7p every day) -  a Big Beer and Big  Hot sakes are $6.    Service was prompt and friendly.  Love the reusable Sushi Menus!  My asks - close Monday and open Sunday.  Put some cold sake on Happy Hour.  Will be back

Had a nice lunch there.  Even on a warm day the restaurant is very comfortable and airy with the front open.   We ate the shrimp tacos, excellent, the calamari sandwich, good, and the teriyaki chicken.  My only negative is the hot spice that is put on the pineapple that goes on the chicken....  Not mentioned on the menu and an unpleasant surprise for the guest eating it!  Other than that, great venue, attentive service, good drinks, we will be back

We had a fun dinner here... Mix of us shared four broths... A little chaotic but fun.  It is easy to mix and match ingredients to your liking, accommodate those who like spicy and those who do not.   Veggies, meats, seafood, shellfish....  Attentive staff, good bar from the next door Red Thai....  We will be back
