How disappointing!   2 1/2 hrs for lunch really? Poor service and waitress dropped the whole tray of sake and beer on the floor beside us. Then proceeded to clean it up while we sat another 10 mins without drinks.. No manager came by to check on us or bothered to say anything at all. I will be checking this place off my list

LOVE LOVE  One of my favorites!! Best Chicken Pita I have ever had!! The Greek salad is very delish as well! And i dont really even like fries and they have some of the best fries ever!! I always get a side of pita bread because its that good and fresh.. Highly recommend!! Love the owners as well very nice!

Hate to say it, but this was definitely a disappointment!  This is a southern style restaurant? First if you are called Okra maybe you should serve okra, Not just regular plain okra.. FRIED Okra isn't that what they eat in the south? They don't even have regular iced tea!!! Some people don't like green tea...( thats all they serve is green tea).  The four of us tried a lot of the items on the menu and everything was just plain greasy and not good. The chicken skins, I can't believe they serve these this is a heart attack on a plate. We will not be returning, their are other spots in the valley to get good southern style food.

Expectations to high! We really wanted to like this place.   The Location is great and the court yard area is wonderful but with that said you have to have great food and staff to back it!  The service was so slow,  the dishes were dirty, and they never came to clear the plates when we were finished.  It seemed like they just were not well trained. The pizza we ordered was just ok our burger came out well done when we ordered it Medium  and the ceaser salad was the blandest worst salad I have ever tasted..   Very over priced for what it is and the options you have to choose from, Maybe this will just be a drinking happy hour place..   - MNSS Review team
