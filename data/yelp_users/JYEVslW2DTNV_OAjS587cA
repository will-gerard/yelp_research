Started off promising....we had a big party (8 adults and 3 small children). Took our drink orders and was able to get that done. Was going around and taking food order, but one person in our party wasn't ready and she said she would come back to her. She finished taking the rest of our orders and then forgot to take hers. Someone had to go and tell her that she had forgotten. People make mistakes so that was understandable. Then our food came out after about 35+ minutes. Not cool when you have three little kids. Our food came out fine and my son needed a refill, the server actually noticed it and asked if she could get him another and I said yes. 5 minutes later he still didn't have his drink and he was asking for it. We had asked for ranch and pickles when we ordered and they were not brought out with the food either. Two people in the party had soup/salad and had finished their salad completely before they had to remind the server about the soup. Then when they reminded her she came back with one soup and said sorry they have to make more. So she waited another 10 min for her soup which came out so hot she couldn't even eat it right away anyway. The rest of us were finished eating by then. She made a mistake with one person's bill ( which was the same person she forgot to come back for her order) which made her have to wait even longer...again.

Our server Cassy went out of her way to accommodate my kids and family.  She was very helpful and friendly.  I had a 3 year old and a 10 month old and she was very patient with both of them. She made us feel comfortable and brought out crackers and oranges for my kids. Food was tasty and bread was delicious as usual. A favorite place for my kids and my grandmother to come and enjoy a yummy lunch. When we were leaving the kids were looking at the lobsters and the host, Robert was very nice and friendly with my grandma (who is 82) and my kiddos also. He even took a lobster out of the water for my 3 year old to see it up closer. It was a very great experience and I love this red lobster location best of all!

Went here other night for my birthday! Love that they have reservation options and they had the table ready when we were there. Our server was amazingly nice, funny and personable. We had 7 in our party. They went out of their way to make sure we were having fun and made my birthday a great one!

Used to love this place...went here tonight and they are horribly understaffed. I know it's not the employees fault but it took about 10 min just to have someone come to the front to take our order. Out of 6 orders they messed up on 2. The employees were very friendly and apologetic,  but that doesn't make up for it. A lady at another table took her burger back up to the front because it was served raw. We have been here at least 5 times and unless things drastically change back to the way they used to be, we will not be returning. Buns were soggy...fries were over salty...and everything just seemed sloppy :(

Was not happy with this location/most of the employees that I dealt with the past few experiences I've had here. I work in the area and on occasion stop by on my break for my dinner. I order my food to go always. I don't like how the new set up (order at the front/ pay) and then just wait around for the employees to stop talking with eachother and actually get around to getting to work and having your food ready. I think the old set up gave the employees behind the counter an opportunity to stay busy and give customers  the experience they deserve. The last few times I've been to this location in the evening, I've noticed only a few people actually being productive and the rest of the employees treating their job as a social event where they laugh, talk, and flirt more than anything else. I am still young enough to understand working and having friends, but when someone is being blocked physically from bringing me my food and he tries to walk around the other side of the counter (island) area and the girl runs over to the other side to block him again...All while I'm watching and waiting for my soup. She was treating it like a playground and  he seemed annoyed that she wouldn't give him space to do his job and he saw that I was waiting.  I saw a group of probably 5 people standing around in a circle chatting by where they make sandwiches, while only one/two employees was making food and one/two was at the register and there was a line of people waiting to order. There was also 2 employees standing by the drinking fountain.  I tried getting the tea I like and it was empty so I went to another type instead.  One of the two of them, then walked over and started looking in the tea containers, but didn't say anything to me or offer to go get more of the type I wanted. I honestly love the food (especially the soup), but  will try to go to other places instead just because of the immaturity of the employees, the lack of management presence (unless they were there and allowed that), and the overall lack in customer service in general. This makes me sad because it used to be one of my favorite places to go. The specific incidents from my latest experience was on Tuesday, October 14th in the evening.
