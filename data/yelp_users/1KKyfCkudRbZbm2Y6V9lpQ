Delicious fresh bakery. Everything is made fresh every morning! It's fantastically delicious and not overly sweet. Cake is moist and has really good cream. Try to get here early since they go fast! :)  He also make wonderful macaroons!!

I'm not a vegetarian but I really like their lunch buffet. It's all so delicious and I like that they don't always have the same thing.   The food has good taste and spices and it's hot but in a enjoyable way! I very much have enjoyed their soups and usually use a carrot stick to cool off my mouth.

Food is ok nothing really special. Went on a weekend night and it smelled really weird in there. They had line dancing which was cool but I think the average age in there was 50.   We only stayed about an hour but we got 2 drink and they were both pretty gross. Way to strong and not good alcohol. Most likely will not revisit.

Good breakfast. We just went shopping and decried to eat here. A lot of really good sounding options. Their hash brows are really delicious and it's not very expensive.   They also have a lot of breakfast alcoholic drinks which was interesting.
