Tuesday morning I scheduled an appointment for them to come out Friday 12-2.  2 comes around and no show no call so I called the office and was told they were running a bit behind which was fine I asked for the new estimate and was told 3. At 5 when I had still heard nothing I called the office again and was told I would be put on the urgent list since I had an appointment and it was already well past the 12-2 time slot.  At 8:40  I called again to check and see what was going on and got the voicemail.  I recieved a call at 9:15  that they were on their way and the plumber  was here by 9:30 he was excellent, professional and courteous  and was able to fix our issue before 10. Honestly if we had been called and told about delays or had been helped with in our quoted time frame I would have given them a 5.
