Came here on Easter based on the recommendations of friends for their Fish & Chips (for my mumsie).  I had been here a few times before, but only had appetizers and drinks.    Mom liked the fish & chips, said it tasted like a tempura batter, I don't like fish so I didn't try them to know.  The chips here are awesome...they're cut like a really thick potato chip which I ordered as an appetizer, but wouldn't have had I known those were the same type of "chips" coming with my mom's meal.  The tartar sauce, I'm sure is made in -house so it does have dill in it, which it looked like the fish batter did also.  I didn't care for the tartar sauce but mums didn't oppose it.    Also I was asked if I wanted the appetizer chips to come out first, which I did because we were starving, but everything came out at the same time.  So for $6, it's a good appetizer, but not when you're already getting it with your meal.  The lunch sized portion was just right with 2 good sized pieces of fish, a side of cole slaw, and the chips for $9 (served before 4:00pm).  The chips also come with this delicious sauce which I would kind of describe as a fancier version of 1000 island.  Delicious!  I ordered the Shepherd's Pie, which I was somewhat apprehensive about after reading the reviews, but I thought it was pretty good.  It lacked salt, but I'd rather something lack salt and be able to add more than vice versa.  The presentation was absolutely marvelous, and the potatoes on top were to die for.  It was served with a side salad, also a lunch special for $9. I could have substituted "chips" for the salad if I wanted, which, again, I would have done had realized what I was doing.    Service was fairly quick, which it should have been as we were one of about 3 tables in the whole place, and our server was very friendly.  The Guiness brownie looked tempting, but I had a Snake-bite with lunch and that always makes me too full to even finish my meal.    All in all, a decent meal and I would definitely return again, but based on the fish and chips alone, Mums and I decided we're going to try another place next time.

This is one of my favorite breakfast/brunch places and has been since I was a little girl. Been coming here since I was about 5 or so and rarely is there a day that Tom, the owner, isn't there to greet us. The menu hasn't changed much but it hasn't needed to. There is something to please every palate here from pancakes the size of your head to omlettes to Benedicts, from waffles to frittatas. I've only had lunch items once or twice and the homemade potato salad is just amazing (but they don't have it every day, so call ahead).  The homemade jellys are a staple and they order all local products and ingredients.  My favorite is and always will be the Eggington Omlette which has chicken, mushrooms, broccoli, cream cheese and is topped with hollandaise sauce and I'm not even an Omlette person.  Substitute the English muffin with a pancake for an extra treat but be prepared to take some home.  If you go on weekends be prepared for a wait if you're there anytime after 9, but trust me, it's well worth the wait!!

I have been a patron of Eggingtons for over 20 years. I have nothing bad to say about the food itself, it's amazing and wonderful and I'll still come back despite this review. However, that being said, a patron who has been coming for 20+ years should have been treated in a much more professional manner.   I made a reservation 2 MONTHS in advance of the Saturday before mother's day to have a Bridal Shower Bruncheon for my Sister-in-law. Yes, it was a large party, yes it was the Saturday BEFORE Mother's Day...all of which was irrelevant because if this was going to be a problem, you should NOT have taken the reservation for me in the first place. Most restaurants I go to that I've made reservations for usually have the table ready for me when I get there, which I assumed would be the case as I had requested it be ready a few moments ahead of 11:30 so I could set up the cupcakes, games, etc. I arrived at 10:55 to be sure that everything was in place and to drop off the cupcakes so they wouldn't melt. The hostess took the cupcakes and my name and said the table wasn't ready yet, so I went to run a last minute errand and came back at 11:20. To my chagrin, not only was my table STILL not ready, another party was still occupying it, which I was told only after waiting for another 10 minutes with balloons, favors and gifts in the lobby when I finally went up and asked what had happened with the reservation.  The hostess basically had no response other than that it "wasn't quite 11:30 yet" and that the bills were being taken up. I glanced over to where she had just looked and saw that the people were literally still eating. Another party of 15 people were not even close to being done, so it was close to noon before we were seated.  After finally getting settled, there were no further issues, but it just wasn't what I'd had in my mind. I'd wanted everything all set up and pretty for everyone's arrival, and there was no apology for the miscommunication on Eggington's side.  It may not sound like it from this review, but I'm actually a pretty reasonable person. If something like this happens, I get it, it's an accident, but don't make me stand there with a group of 15 people and feel like the dummy when it wasn't my fault either. Bring out some muffins, find another place to move us out of the way, continue to apologize for the mistake and bring me some free whatever-the-bride-to-be's-favorite-drinks are (raspberry mochas) when we're finally seated. It's really a lot easier to alleviate these issues than it seems, unfortunately management doesn't seem to take this approach the majority of the time.

I've been meaning to update this for awhile, just hadn't gotten around to it.  I cannot, in good faith, leave my rating of Eggington's with 1 star.  This is my go-to, staple, home-grown, proud-to-be-a-native-Phoenician breakfast place.  I've never brought anyone here that didn't have wonderful things to say about it, and the food is absolutely wonderful.  The same owners, recipes are constant and haven't changed on the quality of ingredients.  I don't know what I shall do if they ever close...  The Egginton Omlette is probably my favorite, but with a pancake on the side.  Followed by their eggs benedict.  Lunch isn't bad either!  But go for the breakfast.

This is my first time at the Gilbert location, been to the Scottsdale locale many, many times.   Tried the calamari for the first time, and and the chips and queso. Calamari was bombastic. I've had calamari many places, San Fran, New York, Vegas, & the flavors & spices on this are wonderful. The edamame is standard but comes w/a great ginger/soy sauce.  Very attentive service, although the bar could use some more variety in their flavored vodka. I asked about having special flavors ordered if I became a regular (that's what many bars in my area have done for me) and the bartender was pretty snide and said that wasn't usually done here. I should have asked a manager instead.   Still excellent service and great food, will be back!!

Absolutely one of my favorite sushi places in all of the state...the filet wrapped asparagus is amazing, spicy tuna on crispy rice cakes are great, all the sashimi rules, the baked crab roll...unlike anything I've ever had, delicious. They have awesome happy hour specials but beware its a very small inside bar, so get there early.  They have amazing mixologists and always have a nice seasonal drink menu.

The karaoke guy on Friday's is phenomenal, however, we were regulars here, both manager and waitress (who was new) admitted that we were great customers, yet we were charged for 4 drinks we did not order.  The manager displayed very poor customer service skills, we had a massive amount of hair in a burger we ordered, cold fries, hard, dry wings and a very poor experience. After politely explaining the situation for over 15 minutes and respectively arguing the manager refused to void the portion of the bill for the drinks.  So he would rather loose what he admitted were great customers (and it looks like we were some of the few, judging by the other reviews here) over a measly $30.  We will have to find a new karaoke joint, bummer!

Reserved a cabana for a friends bachelorette through VIP Services (highly advertised on their website).  Had been here a few times before, no issues, had a lot of fun.  Once I determined that Spanish Fly would work for us, there were multiple e-mails back and forth between the VIP host and myself about details for the event and I had confidence that everything would be made perfect for our group of 25 girls that night.  I talked it up to many in our group because others had made different suggestions as to other places for the evening, but I really pushed for Spanish Fly because of the way the communication was going with the VIP host and myself.  I truly felt they would make my friend feel special.  Unfortunately, I could not have been more wrong.    When I arrived with the 20+ girls in my group, I discovered that absolutely none of the decorations I hand delivered in 2 separate trips that day (at the offering/suggestion of the host) had been set up in our cabana (which was not even a cabana...just a square couch with a folded down umbrella. Cabanas are reserved only for those getting bottle service).  I was taken to a back office to speak with the hostes and a manager and was told that there were multiple bachelorette parties that evening and there was some confusion as to who's decorations were for which party.  I had clearly labeled my decorations with a very large slip of paper with the bride's name on it (who the reservation for the evening was under) so I'm not quite sure where the confusion came into play, and the other bachelorette party I saw there that evening didn't appear to have any decorations.  I also sent the host an e-mail after I finished dropping off the 2nd set of decorations the day of the party asking if I needed to do anything else to be sure that the decorating was taken care of as I wanted to be certain everything would be set up for us when we arrived.  It was a terrible disappointment that it wasn't.  Not only did I miss out on all of the fun at the hotel pool with the rest of the bridal party so I could drop things off at the club, but the situation made me, as the organizer, look like I was the one who let the ball drop.  To make matters worse, while the host ran around trying to set things up at the last minute, nobody was told to come and take care of us while we waited.  The manager should certainly have been the one to be sure that was happening rather than continuing to sit in the back office.    The host finally showed us to our seat, which wasn't the area where I had originally requested at all, but completely on the opposite side of the club and as far away from the dance floor as possible.  We were finally brought some complimentary shots, and what I thought were complimentary pitchers of drinks to make up for our trouble.  However, at the end of the evening, I was charged for the pitchers as well.  Every other bar we had been to that evening happily to provided our party with complimentary shots, even if it was just in passing.  Had I known the shots were all that the hostess was providing us with for this huge faux pas, I would have asked her to give me my bag of decorations and left.    Awesome service by Jenn, can't say enough good things about her.  DJ and his house music sucked.  When the server has a party who's been seriously pissed off, get over yourself and play the bride-to-be a remix of the song she wants to hear.  Have written a letter to the owner.  If he corrects the situation, I will change my rating.
