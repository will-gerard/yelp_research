This place was awesome me and my friend went for mani/pedi and we waited about 5 mins then we got seats next to each other for pedis. Did a good job. The manis...I had gel and they did a neat job and quick! When we paid I couldn't believe it $39 for pedi plus gel mani! Definitely would go again.

I just happened to be driving past here. Next time I will keep driving. I don't really write reviews but I will for this place. I had a gel manicure  which cost $25. They used the electric file to remove the gel I had on, and didn't remove it all, So my new gel is all uneven. He then went to tidy up my nails and filed them at an angle because he wasnt paying attention so I have slanty nails. Another woman did the gel. She brought the wrong colour to start, didn't dehydrate the nails and just went straight into the clear. She put this on in two strokes, it didnt touch the edges of my nail top or bottom. Then she did two coats of colour which was hard to mess up seems as I had a clear sparkly colour. The colour is not all over my nail. After curing the first coat I notice a huge clump stuck to my thumb nail which she trimed off with a clipper.  Biggest bug bear for me was after curing and anybody who gets gel will have had happen, is that sometimes your skin around the nail is stuck to the gel, easily fixed by filing down the over hang of gel... this was not done so I have left with all my fingers stuck to the gel and gel that is over hanging the nail on eitherside. In my experience it will make the gel lift off the nail a lot quicker if anything can get under the gel. I wouldn't mind if it was cheap but I can get a gel mani for $30 in scottsdale where they actually know what they are doing and it lasts.

Been here 4 times now and love it. They do a good job and its cheap too. Been for gel mani and regular pedicure and both are done well. Tina does my nails and she always takes her time to make sure she does a great job. Only down side is color selection but still i will be making this my regular place. My gel with design was $30 and my mums was $25.

Had an amazing dinner here on a Wednesday night and the place was really busy. We had foie gras starter to share and it was amazing, glad we shared though as we got 4oz of it. For main we had the salmon and the lamb both were beautifully presented and came out quickly and cooked to perfection. To finish we had the expresso creme brulee to share, again a big dessert but a delicious alternative to after dinner coffee. The service was excellent and it was a really pretty setting on the patio. And fun the house of tricks has a resident cat.

Love the food here! First time in and not disappointed. We had the lettuce wraps and the peking duck pancakes and a chicken fried rice. The peking duck was amazing.  I haven't found anywhere in AZ yet that does this and its something I have craved from the uk for so long. Our waiter was really helpful and attentive. I will definitely be making this a regular for chinese food.

I really enjoyed this place, we sat outside which was kind of enclosed and misted so it was pleasant to eat there. Our waiter was really nice and got us some drinks started which were pretty strong, so no complaints there. We had the bacon, blue cheese salad and added steak and it was so good. we also shared the blackened fish sandwich which was also amazing. I had the Israeli couscous as a side and it made the meal. The portions are large but we managed to squeeze in a dessert, who wouldn't in a place called the white chocolate grill?! We had the white chocolate brownie, made for two it was huge and after dinner we didn't finish it but definitely worth a taste. I would recommend it to anyone in the area looking for a casual dinner. The bar area was nice too with tables all facing the tvs if thats your thing.

My over all experience of this restaurant was one that was mediocre. Don't get me wrong they can cook a steak and the restaurant is beautiful. The service brings the experience up but would i go back? No. I worked at this resort and therfore knew what standards to expect when we came for a staycation. The resort, pools and bar were everything you would expect and more and they really did make 'moments into memories'. I know that there are other fantastic restaurants on property that i have repeatedly eaten at and will continue to frequent. Save your time and  money and skip Bourbon steak house.

This place is a hidden gem. It's in the hood but I go because I go to school right by here. I have been here a few times now and every time they do a good job. its never crazy busy and they have plenty if staff. A basic pedicure is $18 and the best thing about here is the masssage your legs forever! I have a gel mani there and they do a really good job. I have had a french there which ben did and its the best I have ever had. It lasted basically until it was so grown out that I couldn't bare it anymore.  They are good at doing designs and if you have a picture they will try anything. They do tend get gel on your skin but nothing a little filing doesn't fix and when a gel with design is only $30 I don't complain when just a regular gel mani in scottsdale is $30 withous designs and never lasts as long.

Love this lady. You can stop by get your eyebrows done and she does any amazing job. I have been threading my eyebrows for years and she makes such  good job. Plus there are always some spots that hurt more than others and she doesn't hurt at all. This is definitely my new regular

This place is the best nail bar I have been too, they are a little bit more expensive but worth it. They are really busy so definitely make an appointment although they do take walk ins. The day we went was prom so they easily had 30 people plus in there. The place had a really nice atmosphere and there are so many colours, the lady told me they have 500+ gel colours ands even more that aren't. Will definitely return!

Me and a friend went for happy hour and dinner here at 5.30 and it was packed! very popular place and for all the right reasons. We asked for a table and they said 15 minutes so we grabbed a drink at the bar. It was crazy busy and we ordered a mule and a miss piggy to drink. Both good but I have had them before here and they didnt garnish them like they did before, probably because they were so busy. We had to go ask for our table 30 minutes later and got sat right away but it took another 10 minutes for a waitress to come, she was very busy but friendly and efficient. We grabbed another round and some appetizers which were delicious on happy hour the deviled eggs and the pate both were really good. For main we ordered the french dip and bacon and eggs. Both were delicious but very filling. We had the lemon bar for dessert and shared which was just right for two people. Also on Fridays they have live music which was really cool too. Definitely would go back just make sure you get there early!

I went with a girlfriend last night to the pressroom to see fever a burlesque show. Its was their opening night last night for the venue and the show. We had a blast. The show was hilarious and sexy, Kelly the host was so much fun. The show had a few technical hitches but kelly and the dancers handled it like pros, things I'm sure they will work out. The dancer were talented and sexy and put on a fantastic show. Fire dancing, aerials and stripteases were all part of it. It was a sold out performance and when we arrived there were no seats together, the management were so helpful and actually gave up their stage side table to us. The show will be every friday and will change themes too. They do dance classes from the dancer themselves too which sound like fun! Definitely would go back again! As a group it would be fun! I would definitely get central seats so you don't miss a moment of the action.

This place is super cool and the talented team live up to   the hype. I went in for dinner and was pleasantly suprised by the open mic night which was happening. The restaurant is really interesting and has a lot more to offer than the facade of the restaurant suggests. They have a beautiful central wine room and a cozy patio area in the back. I sat at the bar with adam the bartender who made me feel very welcome. Ryan the manager suggested a pri fixed menu to me, it sounded fantastic and for the price was an excellent choice. The first cuurse was a frisse and compressed apple salad with bacon lardons and was really tasty, the richness of the lardons and the crunch of the apple was a good combination and was just the right portion size to keep you wanting more. Second course was a foie gras and asain spicy slaw sandwich and again super tasty. Foie gras is one of my favorites and this is by far one of the best I have had in a long time. I have never had it before with spice and it was a really delicious and interesting twist. For the entree was a spicy remen noodle with poached eggs and scallops. The scallops were cooked to perfection and it was served in a cute binto box too. If that wasn't enough ryan suggested I try the nutella creme brulee and I'm so glad I did. I would definitely share this but it was prepared perfectly with hazelnuts to garnish and that satisfying crisp top every brulee should have. I would definitely recommend this place for a function or if you want to break the mold and for any foodie that wants to try some of the inventive and out of the box creations that chef Jeremy delivers.

This place is amazing, just what scottsdale needed. A bar with class and all the talent to match it. Simply the best dining experience I have had in a long time. Highly recommend it for any event and to finish it off the GM is English! so nice to see a fellow lady from the mother land. I would recommend booking, word is out about this place and very popular.

This place is awesome, right across the road from patties in oldtown its perfect to start the night and the open air theme is cool. The service was really interactive and relaxed and our server had lots of knowledge on the vast menu. It was hard to pick there were so many tasty options. Added bonus was happy hour until 7pm saturday and sunday.  I was recommended to try hulas for the drink menu and it didn't disappoint! I had the tiki bastard and it was so good! A twist on the traditional mule. Plus the drinks are all served in fun glassware so you feel like your drinking cocktails on the beach. To eat I had the thai chicken bowl which was huge and judging from some of the portions coming from the kitchen they serve big, but really tasty and nice presentation. My friends had the pork tacos and the cheviche and both were delicious, one of the best ceviche I have had in AZ.  Cool place to hang out and enjoy the atmosphere, I would definitely be back to try more!

I love this place! The food is awesome. Pad thai, panang and the yellow curry are all yummy. My all time favorite is the tom ka soup, delicious. They also do a combo meal so you can get the soup on the side with once of the curries. If you are looking for a caffeine kick the thai tea and coffee hit the spot. They also have a drive through, i would call ahead for big orders although it probably only tool them 20 minutes to get my order ready.

This place is awesome originally pro nail is under new management.  The service here is great they take their time to make sure they get it right. I have been there twice now for a gel mani and both times i was really pleased with the result.  They offer chilled water and they are very friendly and remembered me from the first time i went. The place is clean and modern and focus in giving the best service. I watched one lady get nearly a 30 minute leg massage while having a pedicure, i think i definitely will go back for that as well as my gel. I had designs both times and they were done very well. My first gel didn't chip or peel, infact when i went back today (two weeks later) it was still going strong i just wanted to switch it up. They will be having a grand opening in april and a mothers day special.
