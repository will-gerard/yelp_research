I am very passionate about this place. I've been coming here since I was in grade school. The #19 Bacon egg and cheese breakfast burrito is by far my favorite. Great salsa and chips too. You won't regret eating The Original Burrito Co.

Brought in my shifters to get repaired. They call me two days later and said they are ready. I go to mount them on my bike and they're still broken. Instead of wasting more time by taking the shifters off the bike, I bring in my entire bike and ask them to do the shifters again. The guy charges me again to do the same job he said he completed before. I asked him about it and he told me he did "everything for me" whatever that means. I just wanted my shifters to be done I never asked for anything else. Poor communication and just not a good way of doing business by doing something different than what a customer asks for.

Might be the highest priced auto shop I've ever been to. Get ready to pay BIG. And I had a little coupon to get my oil and tires rotated. Took them 8 hours... On a Wednesday morning/afternoon. To change oil and rotate tires is ridiculous. Should've just did it myself. I recommend Dick's Ace Auto Repair on Central and Southern. You'll save on time, money and bull$hit

Some of the best soul food this side of the Mississippi. Catfish is best in Ahwatukee

This is such a great place for sushi and teppan. Atmosphere is attractive and the food is of the highest quality.   A real gem Rock Lobster

Such good food for such good price. Waitresses are friendly and if they drop your food, you get 15 dollars off! But seriously best ribeye steak I have ever had.
