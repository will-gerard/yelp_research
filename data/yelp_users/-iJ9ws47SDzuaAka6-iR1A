I'm writing this review as my girlfriend and I are waiting for service. It's been 18 mins exactly since we've been seated and no one has even brought us water. Beyond that I have nothing else to say. Step it up guys! We just moved into the neighborhood, and sucks that this was are first impression ~B~

Update! They fixed all the issues I wrote previously, girls are always nice at night and remembered us every time. We have since moved up to north Scottsdale, and will miss out late night splurges.   This place is seriously addicting, they have new flavors everyday which they let you try all of them if you'd like.  Since stumbling upon this place with my girlfriend, we've been going at least 3 times a week.   Only cons I have are the place still looks under construction, I love banana splits and the put them in a huge foam cup and give you a long spoon that just bends and becomes a pain to eat with. Also the hours are strange, went the other day around 3 but they weren't opening til 5pm?!   Minus those little things the custard nonetheless is pretty amazing!  ~B~

Been using Joseph's talents in photography for the past few years, and can't give him enough praise. Always gets great shots, edits and delivers the final product for all our events the next day! Has never disappointed, and always on time. He has also always stepped in last minute to save us when other photographers flake. Would recommend him to anyone ~B~
