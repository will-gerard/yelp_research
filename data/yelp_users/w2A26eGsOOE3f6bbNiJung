Never even got in to eat..party of 2 and waited over 40 minutes.. multiple parties came after and got in before us even after talking to the hostess 2 times as they agreed the messed up. Thought we had it figured out finally  until they cluelessly did it again 2 more times.. gave up and went to uncle bears for a better experience..
