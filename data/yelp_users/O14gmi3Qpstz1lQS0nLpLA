Um...no!  Chips are obviously from bags.  Salsa were runny and definitely not spicy.  (Remember - "made in New York City?!?!?)  I had the carne asada.  It was ok.  I usually devour the entire place but I just couldn't get into it.  The rice was bland.  Overall, it was just disappointing!  I should have just eaten at Qdoba which was nearby.  Service was mediocre.   Moral: just because it is right next to the hotel doesn't mean food is gonna be awesome.

As a Native Texan, I grew up with Jack in the Box.  When I moved to DC 15 years ago, I was dismayed to learn that Jack isn't in the East Coast.    That was...until I came to Charlotte for a conference.  You should have seen my eyes widened when I recognized Jack!  In the midst of the conference, I told my friends, I'm going to Jack in the Box even if I have to walk there.  We all got in the car and drove happily to Jack and ordered ourselves some happiness!  Oh, Jack!  You haven't changed a bit!  Thanks for staying true!

Recently, I came here for a conference.  The hosting organization did a superb job by selecting this awesome hotel!  This hotel is conveniently located in the midst of restaurants, stores, and whatnots.  There's an awesome pond in the back with even more restaurants.  The hotel itself is spacious with ample space for exhibits, registration, and socialization.  The rooms for workshops were impressive, allowing a large number of participants to attend.    The room was nice and decent.  Nothing fancy.  The beds were a little too soft for my liking.  Throughout the night, I just could not sleep.  Tossed and turned.  Folded pillows in half.    The staff were friendly and helpful.    I'll be back next summer as another hosting organization will have a conference there!

Sky Harbor is like a mall and an airport.  Heck, they even have an art gallery in there.  What's even better is that Sky Harbor offers free wi-fi!  Lovely!  One thing that was unusual was that when I needed to reserve a seat with Super Shuttle, there was no office/desk, like those rental car companies.  I must've circled the airport like 3 times before asking for directions.  Oh.  There is no office.  You just go outside and look for a dispatcher.  (Apparently, you're supposed to reserve ahead of time.  BWI & DCA, I heart ya.)    Other than that, nice airport.

You know when you go on vacations...you try to check out the local places and restaurants...right? Well, don't ask me why the other parties on my vacation trip wanted to go safe and dine here. And worse, on New Year's Eve!!!!   And on New Year's Eve, this place was pretty much quiet with few tables occupied.  So, waitservice was friendly and attentive.  Despite my disappointment with hanging here on New Year's Eve, food was surprisingly good.  Hey, anything with Jack Daniel's in the food is bound to make it delicious!  If only TGIF wasn't so dark inside, everything would have been just right.  Turn up the lights a bit.  Not all of us are hideous looking, ya know.

No thanks to Facebook and Twitter where people in the East Coast hear about In-N-Out on a regular basis.  Imagine my surprise that I discovered an In-N-Out in Phoenix when I thought they were only in California.  Man, I have to say that their simple burgers are among the best that I've had!  Freshness does make a whole world of differences.

Had a fabulous time at Charlie's, meeting friends from college and making new friends there!  I did find it odd for a dance lesson to be going on during peak hours.  Must be a Southwest thing.  Over here on the East...dance lessons are Mondays and Wednesdays at 5pm.  Some of the bar areas could use a renovation and expanded instead of looking like it used to be a janitor closet.  With all the dancing going on, it got a bit hot in there.  Nice to have a covered outdoor patio to hang out...if you can handle the cigarette smokes all around.  Overall, I had a good time with friends at Charlie's!

Came here for a professional training/workshop, which the company paid for my stay at this hotel.  I have to say that I was impressed with this place.  My own room with a gorgeous view of the Old Town and the swimming pool below.  Hilton Garden is within walking distance to several restaurants, bars and shops.  And if you wanted to explore further, just hop on the free trolley.  The pool is a decent size, bigger than most hotels that I've stayed before.  The lounge areas are outfitted with mist sprays overhead.  The lobby is inviting, which you could chill out with friends.  Also, if you're thirsty, you can get complimentary (plastic) cups of water or lemonade.  Plus, there is a 24-hour snack shop, filled with alcoholic beverages, sodas, juice, chips, candies, frozen food, medicines and toiletries.  Dood!  Along with a restaurant and a bar, you could never leave this hotel.  Best of all...complimentary wi-fi!!!

Came here based on a recommendation from a colleague.  Eh.  Honey, I've had better Mexican food in DC.  Yeah, that says a lot.  (The extra star is for the wonderful service.)  I had the combo platter, since I wasn't sure what to have.  The pork tamales was too thick and dried.  I make better tamales myself.  The cheese enchilada was a joke.  They were skimpy on the cheese both inside and outside the enchilda.  No taste/flavor at all.  The beef taco was a surprise.  I found myself savoring every bite of it.  The rice...so-so.  The waiters were attentive.  They did their best handing 20 of us.  Not an easy job but they made it!  So, they alone deserve a star.  Nonetheless, I wouldn't recommend this place to friends.

This is one friggin' huge airport!  If I'm not mistaken, this one's bigger than the one in Dallas.  This airport can be a good thing or a bad thing.  You see, once you land, you'll immediately see slots, which you can start your taste of Vegas.  (I guess that's a good thing...to get the party started!)  But, flying back home, you just might be tempted to spend your last $20 dollar bill on a slot machine...praying for that jackpot.  (That's bad, right?)  Other than that, this is a godzilla of an airport.  You gotta take the monorail to get to anywhere.  The baggage claim area...goodness, you could get lost.  Just get your bags and get the hell outta there and start partying on the Strip!

Totally forgot to Yelp about the Star Trek Experience during my recent trip to Las Vegas.    My friend and I, both Trek fans, decided to spend the day here.  We get there and made our entrance.  I do have to say that it was impressive.  You could spend hours reading everything in this cool museum filled with all these Star Trek artifacts.  Me, I was snapping pictures on anything related to Star Trek: Voyager.  (The best of them all!  Na-na na-na boo-boo!)  So, if everything was great, why the 2 stars?  Well!  The rides were just not Deaf-friendly.  Most shows have scripts ready for Deaf people or at least, provide interpreters.  And those that don't provide any kind of accommodations, we'd either get a discount or get our money back.  My friend and I suffered through one of the shows (the Borg show), missing out on everything.  Although, the 3-D (or rather 4-D) stimulations were interesting.  After the show and a look-through the gift shop, we headed back up the front to get our money back, even if it was partial.  Oh no, they wouldn't even dare think about refunding our money.  They were dead set on the non-refundable policy, regardless of what may come.  Even the manager wouldn't even consider our request.  So, that just left a bitter taste in our mouths of how these people at the Star Trek Experience were not understanding or even willing to listen to our experience.  Blah!  For fun, I suggest you check out the Cirque de Soliel shows...

My partner said something like The Riviera is perfect for those people who like those "not-quite-up-to-par" Holiday Inns and the like.    The only reason we stayed at the Riviera because it was one of those few hotels in Las Vegas that allowed us to stay for just one night during New Years Eve.  The other hotels had a 2- or 3-night minimum.    We ended up with a smoking room, which wasn't too bad.  My complaint about the room was that there were cobwebs and dust on the ceiling.    The Riviera could benefit from a facelift.  Their gaming area is...ok.  I was more interested to play at other casinos than at the Riviera.

I loved my stay at the Treasure Island.  Heck, with the mall next to TI, you basically do not have to leave the hotel.  TI has everything for you...restaurants, stores, bars, casinos, theatre (Mystere), Starbucks and many more.  TI is somewhere in the middle of the Strip, so everything is within a reasonable distance.  (The last time I was at Vegas, I stayed at the Stratosphere, which was at the end of the Strip.)  Anyways, had a great room on the 24th floor.  The bathroom was big.  My only complaints are that it was hot in the room even when the thermostat was on cool.  Also, the maids didn't restock sufficient supplies in the bathroom.   Also, TI doesn't offer free wi-fi.  You have to pay $13/day.    Other than that, I had a great time at TI with everything available.

Isla has been rated as being the best Mexican food in Las Vegas.  I was in the mood for Mexican and it was just perfect that Isla was located inside Treasure Island, the hotel that I was staying at.  So, I treated my partner and friends out.  I had the Enchiladas which had chipotle tomato sauce and oaxoca (sp?) cheese.  My partner and friends enjoyed their dishes as well.    I had ordered a margarita.  It came in a small glass and was charged $9 bucks.  At first, I thought...what a joke!  Holy moly!  I was like not even 1/4 done with it and I was already sporting a buzz.  They make strong shit yet delicious!    The restaurant is pretty with enough decorum for you to look and comment with your friends.  The wait service is satisfactory.  Food is wonderful.  Just be prepared to shell out a good wad of money.

Ugh!  First, a lack of creativity/originality on the name of the place.  Puh-leeze!  Then, I wasn't sure what to order because none of my colleagues had been here before.  So, I thought I'd go safe and order chicken alfredo topped with feta cheese and accompanied with slices of garlic bread.  Stupid me, I should have stopped the minute I had my first bite.  It tasted odd.  I thought it must've been because of the feta cheese.  I just had my first taste of (flamed) feta cheese minutes before that a friend ordered as an appetizer.  Immediately after I had my fill of dinner, my stomach cramped.  blank! blank! blank!  As a result, I was up that following morning at 5am, throwing up...for 12 hours!  Yep, food poisoning!  To be sick in a strange city is not comforting!  Ugh!  I should have trusted my instinct and dined elsewhere.  Like I said...ugh!

I've never had a bad experience with Super Shuttle.  They're relatively reliable.  You just have to be prepared for riding in a sparse or packed van.  However, I was surprised that Super Shuttle at Sky Harbor Phoenix Airport didn't have a reservation booth(s) for customers to reserve seatings as can be done in other airports.  Instead, you have to go outside and spot a dispatcher for a ride.  (It is highly recommended that you reserve in advance.)  And depending where you're going (zones), you may have to wait a little while.  I was suprised how cheap it was...$16 dollars, from the airport to Scottsdale.  It cost almost twice as much for riding Super Shuttle from the Baltimore airport.

My roomie's father has this timeshare thingy and selected this place and invited us to fly out here.  Wow!  The Marriott Canyon Villas is one of the nicest places that I've stayed at.  We basically stayed at a huge suite with an adjoining room.  Big kitchen.  Large living room.  Furnished balconies.  Big bathroom.  Washer and dryer included.  You're bound to have a grand time here.  Except...the beds.  I found the bed to be a little too soft for my comfort.  After my second night there, I spent the rest of the week tossing and turning.  My roomie found better comfort on the couch.  I should have just slept on the floor.  Everything else was great!  The hot spa was heavenly.  The sauna was relaxing.  The gym is open 24 hours.  There were adequate games available to keep people, especially kids, busy.  There is a mini-convenience store where you can also rent DVDs.    Canyon Villas couldn't have picked a better location than at Desert Ridge.  If you go out for a walk or a run, you can't miss this huge beautiful golf course.  In addition, you're bound to see wild quails running around.  Don't be surprised if you spot a jackrabbit here and there.  Plenty of nature sceneries here.  Friendly staff here.  Awesome place that just need to improve their beds.

A friend of mine was sick and wanted soup for dinner.  He immediately thought of Pho, which was inside Treasure Island, the hotel that I was staying at.  It was alright.  Limited menu selection.  Our waiter didn't refill our drinks as often as I would have liked.    I had curry chicken.  This was the first time, of any Asian dishes, that my chicken was not boneless.  So...more work for me.  Uh, Pho, bone-in chicken in a soupy dish...not a good combination...especially with a pair of chopsticks.

Palazzo is niiiice!  It's one of those upscale hotels like Mandalay Bay, Caesar's Palace, The Venetian and Wynn.  You gotta have money in order to shop at Palazzo, especially in the mall sharing with The Venetian.  It does take forever to get a damn drink.  The bartenders are too busy making drinks for waitresses or talking with each other.  My friend and I had to flag down 3 bartenders before we were finally given attention.  So sorry that I don't look like Trump before getting fast service.  (Not that I want to look like Trump.)

Sandbar was just an overall disappointing dining experience.  I usually don't complain about the long wait.  In this case, 45 minutes.  However, it was the reason for the long wait.  You see, in my party, we have someone in a wheelchair.  Apparently, all the "handicapped-friendly" tables were in the back where it was occupied for a private party.  You mean, you rather have all the handicapped people in the back...hidden away?!?!?!  A wise manager would have had those tables scattered throughout the restaurant.  And the manager did feel bad.  Offered us a nearby corner table with steps to get there.  Oh Lord!  Do people not think?!?!?!  Like those people who offer menus in Braille to Deaf people.  Hell-o!  Finally, we get there!  Awesome...an interactive table!  You could check out the menus, play games, and even check Facebook on there.  Except...it didn't work.  What's the point?!?!?!  Chips and salsa were bland.  It was "$2 a Taco Night".  Uhm...sometimes simple is best.  These tacos tried to overwhelm you with so many different ingridents and they just turn out to be a mess.  Stick with simplicity, honey.  The only cool thing about this place was this huge overhang light that was covered with Dos Equus bottles.
