VERY DISAPPOINTING!!! I don't know what kind of mexican food the yelpers are having....but I got food I could have gotten @ filiberto's for 4 times the price!!! Rice was dry, the flautas weren't flautas but taquitos.....WON'T be back!!!

LOVED IT!!!!! I have been coming to this sushi joint for 10 years, the name has changed, but the food has remained AWESOME!!!! Sean & Chris really know how to throw down the SUSHI!!!! I absolutely love their HH and the DRAGON salad is SUBLIME!!! When I think sushi, this is the first place I think of!!!!
