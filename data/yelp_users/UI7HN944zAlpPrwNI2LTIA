Nothing special here. Food isn't bad but nothing to get excited about. Especially for the price. Service is just ok. Went there with some friends and probably won't go back.

I was really disappointed. I have been to several Brazilian stake houses and this one doesn't even compare. Salad bar is weak, they are so stingy on the sides such at the cheese breads and friends bananas. And they are more expensive than the other brazilian steak houses. The service was fair. Nothing special. I am sure I won't go back to this place. The one in Scottsdale is worth the drive .

I have known Attorney Yasser Sanchez at Yasser Sanchez law for about 10 years now.  He has helped me with my immigrations questions. I have sent different friends to him for their immigration  needs. Everyone of them has been very impressed with the honestly and efficiency of the attorneys, even saying attorney Attorney Sanchez is "very cool" If Attorney Sanchez (Yasser)  can't help you with your case, he will let you know so you won't waste your time or money. He will be honest and forward with you about your case.  I would recommend Sanchez law to anyone I know looking for an excellent  attorney.

The service was great! Horchata was awesome and the tacos were also great!  We got some quesadillas and some enchiladas ( different than az mex food) It's not your typical American Mexican food you would find at Manuel's or macayos, it's actually real Mexican food from Mexico City.    I really liked. The tortas are huge here!!   I don't know is they brought me out 2 tacos by accident or not, but they said I could just have then as a "regalo ".  The restaurant is kept super clean and the service was awesome.   As we were leaving one of the waiters gave is a discount coupon to come back! I will be back here again!!

Joe's has the best italian ice with real fruit in most of the flavors! my favorite is the Joe Latti.  Custard ice cream mixed with the italian ice. The workers are great and friendly and do a great job explaining all the different flavors and giving out samples of the different ice flavors. The new building is a great place to hang out.

The food was excellent. I will be going back. The staff was very friendly and the waiter was actually Italian too. Small place just like a trattoria would be in Italy. Good portions are not huge but it makes you wanting more. It's about the quality.
