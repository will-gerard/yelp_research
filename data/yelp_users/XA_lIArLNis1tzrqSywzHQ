First I would like to say to everyone that complains about the service is to please stop bitching about it. Yea most of you are stuck in American ways and things should be set in a certain way everywhere. This is a AUTHENTIC Chinese food restaurant, it's not they are being rude or don't want to come back every 2 mins to make sure you are ok it's because there is literally 2-3 waitress's working at a time. I've been here probably 50-60 times since its my fiancé favorite Chinese place in phx, and shes from china and hates Americanized Chinese food, but every time I've been here when it's slow or packed I only see 2-3 waitress's and sometimes a helper here and there. So just be patient.   The food is worth the wait if you order correctly. I've had a few americanized dishes and they were ok and my fiancé was like you need to order for, the authentic menu and wow I was surprised how Chinese food was suppose to taste like. Alot of the dishes have this weird tingly numbing feeling which is weird at first but you get used to it.   A few things I can remember you should get that we always order, I don't know the Chinese names but I'll try to explain the best I can.   1. Husband and wife dish. It's a app and seved cold. About 7 bucks 2. Boiled fish in spicy sauce.  3. Spicy chicken wings but these are cut in half deep fried then cooked in peppers and spices. My favorite  4. Cucumber dish served cold and has tingly stuff on it. Like 4-5 bucks 5. Pork intestines cooked like the chicken wings above. I know that sounds gross but they taste really good. 6. Beef chow fun, yea this is a americanized dish but it's the best beef chow fun I've had anywhere.   There is a few more but I'm drawing a blank. Anyways this is authentic Sichuan food so explore different dishes because they are GOOD!

All I gotta say is their thin crust pizza is so bomb. The sauce they use has so much flavor it makes me want to buy it but then I know I'm too lazy to go home and make a mediocre pizza and waste their awesome sauce on it so I just come in here and eat it :).    Also their garlic bread is bomb also, a must order with pizza and anything really. Haha. Dining in or Togo its awesome. One of my face pizza places next to al forno on Glendale and 57th ave.

This place ok but clearly We need to come back when its busier cause the chicken was very dry, like its been siting for a while. The flavor was nice but the chicken killed it. Maybe if I got a full chicken it would be better but that was just too much chicken for one person.   I got the 1/4 portion which is enough for 1 person and they give, rice, beans, tortillas, lettuce, tomatoes, pickled onions and hot sauce.   When you put everything together it tasted alright but it was just dry chicken.

This place has AWESOME kimchi Chigae, kalbi is ok but kinda overpriced. The service is hit or miss here.   But probably one of the best korean places on the east side.

This place is great and very affordable.   Pho tastes great. Bun Bo hue tastes even better.  You get 4 huge eggrolls here as 3 huge spring rolls. Basically the portions here for the price are awesome.   I usually get a pork plate and a over easy egg on top. I believe it's only $5.99 also.   Bring cash and your appetite.

I come here regularly and I can say I've had almost everything on their menu and it's all delicious. Just recently I found they had Thai tea and it's DELICIOUS! I recommend getting it.   If you want something sweet as well you need to get their macarons and their macaron ice cream sandwiches. As like everything else in this family owned establishment, the macarons are made by one of the sisters named Binh. She's a wizard at baked goods and she takes orders for parties or anything you want. She can custom make the macarons as well. It's pretty awesome.   Only place I go to eat pho, period.   Egg rolls are awesome, they have springs rolls 2 ways which I like the bbq pork version but they have the traditional ones as well.   If you have never tried it or wondered what it is you gotta try the Bánh xèo which looks like a crepe but it's dericious. Yes I said DERICIOUS!   Bun bo hue is flavorful and on point.   Pork, chicken rice plates are awesome as well, I always get 2 eggs cause #ilovegg  Basically try something new when you come nothing has disappointed me once. This place is affordable and offers free parking as well .

There sure is a lot of complainers here talking about cash only. Do none of you carry $10 bucks with you? Actually even less then that? Anyways ranking an establishment because they don't take debit or credit is just a joke. Focus on the food people.   Came here and met up with some friends and I'm a huge fan of BLTs and saw they had it on the menu. I ordered it on wheat bread and they also added avocados.  Let me tell you this, they sure don't skimp on the bacon. The sandwich alone will fill you up and it was delicious. Lettuce was fresh and crispy, tomatoes were great and the avocados gave it that extra kick.  I would recommend getting the BLT   They have the normal steak type fries, not sure what they are called, but they are the bigger cut fries and they tasted good as well just like most places. Can't really mess up on fries.  My buddy got the chicken wings and they were pretty good. They were crispy and juicy inside.   Free refills like any other joint, has the old school look inside but was clean when I was there.   I would come back again.

Last time I was here about 4 months ago everything was fine and decent. You really can't go wrong with fried shrimp.   Girlfriend got the lobster tail which was ok but seemed alittle over cooked but with more butter it wasnt as bad. But as the dinner was about to end I found the most grossest pubic look hair under a popcorn shrimp. I almost threw up. The waiter was very helpful and he removed my item from the bill and the manager apologized which I didn't ask for.   So customer was good there. 1 star for that and another for the yummy biscuits. I also still tipped what the original amount would have been because the server was pretty awesome.   But I have to say this is my last time to red lobster. Not cuz of the hair but because of the mediocre food.

I'm not a huge Greek fan, probably because I don't like lamb gyros or pitas or whatever they want to call it.   But today I went in just get a chicken pita. I thought it would be like any other chicken pita but i was wrong. The chicken was very moist and the flavor was damn good. There sauce actually had good flavor to it since other places I've had we're very bland.   My friend got the chicken kabob plate, which for 8.99 was HUGE. He got a salad then a huge thing of rice, huge chunks of chicken and some toasted pita bread. Well worth it, this thing could probably feed 2 people.   The rice they have is great and the pitas were not over cooked/toasted.   The only draw back is during lunch it can get cramped in there and the Pepsi seemed alittle sweeter than it should be. But those are very small problems.   I would come back again when I'm in the area.

When I first got my dog Kogi (My many default pics btw =D) I wasn't sure where to take him since he was my first puppy. So I did a google search and Glenn animal care was very close to me and Petsmart banfields hospital was some ridiculous prices.  Not saying I want to cheap out on health cuz I would go for the ends of the world for Kogi, but at the same time I rather go to a private practice that makes you feel more at home.   Dr. Umstead is very nice and its professional there, been going for 3 years now for both of my pups. They do cheap vaccine days too for the people on the budget twice a month.

This place is great. You pick the protein and any amount of fresh veggies you want so they can stir fry it together. Its healthy and taste great. They also have a Burrito like meal which they call MuShu which is AWESOME!!.. You can't go wrong, and be for the look out for the older asian lady, she is nice, so you should tip her =D

This place is Da BOMB!!! I've been to many Viet places around Arizona and this is one of my top 3 I enjoy very much. The eggrolls and spring rolls are awesome. I would suggest either one for an appetizer. The pho is scrumpdidleyumptous.  And the rice plates are off the chain. They can get busy but they are worth the wait.

I've been here waaaay too much, first of all if you've never had Viet food I suggest getting an order of spring rolls or egg rolls for appetizers and a bowl of beef pho with meatballs for entree. Or if you feel like a rice plate, pick the pork chop and butterfly shrimp. You can never go wrong with what I just listed.

Came here again they added 20% grat since we did 3 separate checks with only 5 people. Or order wasn't even big and checks were hand written so it's not like there was extra work.

They got everything a Korean needs here. What more can you ask for? Nothing from me it's great   Too all the people that bitch about the smallest things, get a life and worry about bigger issues.   Remember this is not a huge chain of grocery stores like Frys. So if they want to charge 50 cents for using your card for under 10 bucks then so be it. You don't need to shop there. Fees add up and I understand and we live in a world that people will by a pack of gun using their debit card. Ok my rant is over.

For all you walmart haters, the neighborhood stores are clean small and has everything  you want from a supermarket. It's close to my house and cheap to shop. So it's a win win. Also it's never busy so I never have to wait in line.

Most ghetto Walgreens I've ever been too. People outside begging for money. Exit is blocked off by the register so you have to walk around even if you go to the liquor side. Employees look like they hate their jobs. Other than that this place is great.

My favorite place to get boba in az. Been coming here for years. Prob the only place i know that will let you write, draw, paint etc all over the walls. Kinda gives you a street feel inside hence the name ^__^.  I wish they would paint the walls so we could start over.   As far for boba I'm a huge fan of Honey Dew Slush with extra boba. They have have great diamond ice.

Not sure what the big deal is about their wings. They aren't that good and most of them are sorta dry.   I think they cook them too long or something. I've tried this place 3 times and still very inconsistent with all the wings when you eat them   Cool that you can get all these different flavors but wish the meat would be more moist.   Service wasn't bad at all so atleast they have that.   Also they have the UFC fight be they charge a admission which is kind of stupid IMO. And you have to spend a certain amount during the fight. Wtf is that, this place is cheap as hell  I won't be back and I go to a real bar to watch the fights without having to pay.

Granted this is the first time I've been to a barber but the experience was great. I've always went to the same type of stylist and never got what i wanted or though i wanted but lived with the cuts for all these years. Then one day my buddy told me i should try a barber and he suggest this place.   it was weird at first when you walked in, they had like punk rock playing and a nice older lady at the counter telling me to check in. I waited about 45 minutes since they were busy, since they didn't do appts back then but they do now. But it was worth the wait, Tim aka TIMMAY on his haircut card is awesome and a chill guy. I showed him a picture of what i kind of wanted and he went at it.  Told him not to fade too much on the sides and back since I've never had a fade and it felt so weird with short hair all around but it came out clean and they also shave the back of your neck to I guess clean it up.   I've been there about 5-6 times now and will never go to any other haircut place, as long as Tim is cutting my hair I'll will go to him each time.

First I gotta say I always made fun of Filipino food cause it all looks the same and kept calling it Mud. I have a lot of Filipino friends and they live by this food/mud so I decided to have an open mind when I came here to try it out.   Let me tell you the tastes looks better than it looks. But of course not everything looks like mud. I found out they have awesome sizzling hot plates of stuff called sisig which has an egg. Also simple plates dishes with the red looking meat called Tocino. It's so flavorful and perfect with the veggies rice and eggs.   Everything is perfect for either breakfast lunch or dinner so when you come here you can eat whatever you like.   I also enjoy how this place is family owned and run so you get that homey feeling, and they have a bunch of tvs. If you're Filipino they play Filipino shows during the day but I've also seen them showing sports.   Now if you're a drinker they also have a bar, now you would think they would have basic liquor they don't they got everything from well vodka to like 25 year old glenlivets. All Johnny walkers all types of premium vodka and the lists goes on. Oh don't forget the beer, thy got the basics as well but they have a lot of other unique beer like red horse which tastes great if you haven't had one try it.   Now they have some awesome baked goods which are baked fresh everyday. And you must try HALO HALO which they are known for, it's a Filipino dessert filled with deliciousness.

This place SUCKSSSSSSSS. Drinks are expensive and they charge a cover sometimes. A cover!?!? Idk if they still but last time I was there they did and I was like wtf. Only paid it cuz a few friends were inside already but never again.   Service is horrible and then they allow people to dance on the bars which was gross and almost knocked over my drink. Skip this place.

Gotta be the worse gas station ever. First 2 pumps didn't work and top it all off they charge more if you use a damn credit card. I filled up only a half gallon and went to a quik trip. I used a credit card at Qt and it was still 40 cents cheaper a gallon. Wtf are they thinking here charging more to use credit and even debit. What a joke!!!

One of my favorite sub shops around. Truly they perfected the toasted sub. Forget Quiznos and subway you need to come here.   My favorite Is the Kind. Don't ask what it is just order it and get extra pickles, oh yes they are real pickles! They are crisp spear cuts not like those old sliced ones from a jar like everywhere else.   Oh and the cookies are awesome!!!!

Federico's is probably the best fast food Mexican place I've been too. Actually is better than some of the sit down restaurants I've been to. Their burritos are great and taco salad is awesome. They have lunch specials everyday so make sure you check the menus for that.

I was looking for a quick bite to eat and saw the dreaded mcdonalds drive thru, so I thought ok whatever. But then I saw this Mexican place so I decided to try it. And I'm glad I did, I got a ham breakfast buritto and it was seriously the beat one I've ever ate. It just tasted so fresh and authentic. The green sauce they have is great also. I've been back here a few more times and had the Carne Asada Nachos and Wow they were delicious. The 2 ladies I see here are very nice and the place isn't that expensive. I recommend trying this place. I've only had the breakfast burritos and nachos. But I'm sure everything they have will taste great.

Came here to just get a cookie, which I did :). But my friends all get something different and I gotta say yum.   The ice cream sandwich with the cookies was awesome!!!  The yogurt or ice cream was great too. I had a chocolate chip cookie and a glass of milk. Milk was milk but the cookie was great.   Ill def be back to try other things and they also have a lot of old school cans y unused to eat when I was younger. I never really see them at stores anymore.   Also the place is clean and the bathrooms are nice. Nice place to sit in the back by all the hipster bikes.   Valet is free which is nice but I wish we could just park ourselves. That's why they lost a star with me.

Honestly all these yogurt places are the same to me. As long as the yogurt tastes good and they go mochi I'm happy.   This place was good and has a lot of fresh toppings.   What more do you need from a trendy yogurt shop.

Hey Rudy L. Take you snobby sushi eating attitude somewhere else. So what it used to be a l&l and has no bar doesn't mean the food isn't good. FYI you need to reread your review before you actually save it.   I've been to literally 20-30 sushi places around the valley some gross and some awesome and this place is close to awesome. Yes it's family owned and the daughter with a huge bun on top of her head is the waitress and the son and father make the sushi. But most of the time mom and pop shops are the best but in this case the son is the owner.   My favorite things to order are Tuna Karai, Arizona roll and surf and turf. the tuna Karai is a tuna salad with octopus and it's spicy but sooooo damn good. Sometimes I'll order 2 orders with some rice and make that as my meal.   I've had a lot of other rolls to with friends and they are great. The big thing for me is presentation and the sushi looks great. Doesn't look sloppy, no big and small pieces, rice is tight and intact. The fish taste and smells very fresh.   They also have Korean tea. Which is basically barley tea it's very good, ask for it cold.   Anytime I'm in the area I try to stop by and get my tuna Karai fix. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because they don't serve alcohol yet.   Keyword is "yet" I talk to the owner Steve a lot when I'm there and he's already in the process of getting his liquor license which should be approved by may. Nothing like have some sushi and washing it down with some saki bombers.

This is a long review but worth the read, this is a span of close to 2.5-3 hours this took place.  If I could give this place zero stars I would. First got there at 1:45pm to have 2 new tires mounted on the front. I asked him if needed to use the rebuild kits for the tpms sensors and he said "No you don't have too" which was also told to me over the phone a week prior when I called around. Since they said we can mount and un-mount around the sensor without breaking it.   So after that we went back inside so he can take my info and I asked about alignments, and the original cost was 69.99 but told me if i was to do it today he will do it for 49.99 and said ok sounds good. Then I asked him how long will this take and his exact words were "As you can see both bays are open, as in the tire and alignment so it won't take long about 30-45 mins" I agreed and had a friend pick me up to take me back home.  It was now 2:55pm and had no call so I called them back for an update and they told me we haven't mounted the tires yet cause we are waiting for the TPMS rebuild kits. Which I was confused because the other guy said I didn't need it. Then the "Manager" told me about the laws and how they can't do that and such, and I said "Ok but the other guy didn't say I needed it and it was fine" Manager "Well it doesn't matter what he says cause we have to do it this way" Me "well yes it does cause I shouldn't have to pay for it if this was never told to me" Then the manager told me the new total and it was about 7-8 bucks higher then what it was so I was like ok. Then I asked the manager, so was the alignment atleast done and he said "Yes that is done, just waiting for the rebuild kits from our vendor they usually take 20-30 minutes to drop things off but today they are taking alittle longer"  So I decided to give them 40 more minutes and had a friend pick me up and drop me off at 3:40pm, I saw they finally got to one tire. The front desk guy that I first spoke to told me they lost one of the TPMS sensors so had to get another, I'm like wtf ok. But don't worry I'll find it. 5 mins goes by and he said I found the kit and they will start the 2nd wheel.   But after 10 mins passes no one was working on the 2nd wheel, I can see the wheel sitting there on the mount machine, but what happened was he lied to me saying he found it but really they were waiting for their vendor to drop off another set, cause I saw him with my own eyes. I'm like dude, you guys didn't even find it your vendor had to drop another set off.   Why would you lie about something so small to buy yourself time.   I then asked "How did the alignment go" he said "We haven't done it yet" WTFFFFF your manager told me you guys did it already. But that was another lie and then he says "Oh don't worry we will get you out of here in 15 mins" Me "You guys can mount a tire and do a alignment in 15mins!!?!?"   They obviously think anyone that comes in there is not mechanically inclined, you can't mount a tire and do a alignment correctly in 15 mins. But at this point I just wanted to get my car out of there and cancelled the alignment. Cause they clearly don't know how to estimate time properly, which I noticed since 2 other guys waiting were complaining as well.   Now the so called "Manager" brought me out to my car and said the tire your brought in isn't truly round and you can see the wobble so when you leave you will have some bad shakes, at this point, really the new tire I brought in. First I was driving it before and there wasn't any wobbles and when you look at the tire rotate on the balancing machine it was the rim that was moving so it looked like the wheel was properly secured on the balancing machine.   Manager then went off saying "I've owned a lot of high end cars so I know what I am doing" why does that have anything to do on this situation, I don't care if you owned high end cars or a damn moped, that has nothing to do with this situation. So stop trying to brag or lie and finish my car. That was suppose to be done 2 hours ago.  I then just go inside and wait another 5-10 mins for my damn car. Front desk guy says your car is ready. But before he gives me the bill, the so called manager comes inside and starts typing all these notes on my account. Too basically protect their own ass if anything would have happened.  But then I get the bill and I saw that they billed me for 2 tpms kits, so I said "So you guys are going to charge me for the kits" Manager "yea we are cause you needed them and we have to legally do it" Me "Even though this guy right here said I didn't need it" Manager "Doesn't matter what he said" Me "actually it does cause you can't have 2 people saying 2 different things" Then the front desk guy chimes in "Well I mentioned it" Me "You didn't say I HAD TOO, and you said we can do without them, all your doing is trying to save your own ass as well"  **Review** Continued on follow up

They lie about time frame. They lie when they can and can't do. They then go back on what they say right in front of our face when a manager is there trying to save there own ass. They then over charged me for a rebuilt tpms kit they was told I didn't need then I needed then told one price in person then changed the price.   Worst customer service ever, then had he nerve and asked me what I did as my job, like that matters. I don't care if you supposedly had high end cars, I don't care you supposedly know how to mount a tire. I just know what I saw and what I was told and alllllll the people there just BS.   Not only that I saw them teaching someone how to mount a god damn tire on my car, I was staring right at them outside and I can hear clearly how he was showing how it use a balancing machine. Wtf don't learn on a customers car learn on loose tires and wheels.   My previous review was longer but I guess I'll keep this shorter.   JUST DONT COME HERE.

After my not so good meal next door *cough* Da Vang *cough* I decided to walk in the Vape Shop to see what this new craze is with all the kids puffing fake smoke. Shop was very clean and organized. Dan greeted me and asked if I needed any help, and of course I didn't know anything about these vape pens so he was nice enough to inform about what it is and how people use it to quit smoking.   So after about 5-10 minutes of Dan telling me all about it, I was like "wow this would be great for my step-dad" he smokes like a chimney. He's been smoking for like 40 years of his life. SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO LONGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!! Been trying to get him to quit so I was thinking this might work for him.   Dan showed me a few options, I told him I wanted something simple and easy for him to use since he Anti Technology. I opted for a complete kit with a Juice he threw in for free to see if he would like it first and then I can bring him back in so he can taste other flavors and different nicotine levels. Dan was very helpful and would recommend to ask for him if you need any help.

Ok this place seems to be a new place since there is only one barber (Carlos) and it seems empty when I was there. I was a little skeptical since I hate hate hate going to a new place to get a hair cut cause I can never explain myself right and I look like an idiot but after a few cuts the barber remembers me.   So currently I got to another barber for almost 2 years, which I love. But I won't name who or where so it doesn't take anything away from Carlos.   So I gave Carlos a chance and let me tell you he cuts hair fast, I was first worried but he was very detailed and went back at the same spot over and over again and he did a few techniques that my current barber doesn't do and it seemed a little cleaner. Not much but still if I can get a great haircut a little better I'm down for that.   I have some weird hair too and he was able to get it the way I like it and evened everything out as well. The great thing now is I have a barber I can go to on the east side and now here with Carlos.   Don't let the low reviews and new shop scare you, Carlos will give you a good cut and you won't wait long and for $15 bucks for a cut, that's a steal.
