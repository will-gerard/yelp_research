Eaten here on two occasions, about ten years apart 2006&2016. Now I remember why I hadn't gone back.   A friend of mine said the tortillas were fresh and homemade (tortillas weren't bad) but I ordered a chorizo/egg burrito and idk wth I got? Some sort of random beef that was bland in taste and left me looking for a toilet immediately after.   Will not be returning. Visit Adrians #2 in Mesa for good eats& great prices.

Hidden gem! This place looks abandoned right next to the old abandoned bank, but inside, you can't go wrong.   "Mandy's special" is their everyday special and goes for around $7.   In my opinion better than Pete's fish and chips.

I use to visit takamatsu for their all you can eat sushi. The previous owner has left a few years ago and is under new ownership.   Decided to give Ninja sushi a try today. Opened at 11:30am, first one in here. The sushi chef Dominic was great. Helpful and made the portions a good size.   Will definitely return. All you can eat sushi !

Beat the lines, no need to arrive early for seats as you're able to book them online. On top of that, your seat is a Cush recliner. Enjoy!

Good place. Try it yourself. Tried it for the first time this morning. Had chorizo potato and egg burrito.  For the price and size you can't beat it.

Nasty. Food is horrible and takes forever to get drinks. Parking lot smells like a cess pool as well

I've eaten here a few times now and you can not go wrong with the #15 pho.   Only regret I have is not ordering another meal as I left still hungry !!    I have yet to try an entree here but I'm sure I will not be disappointed.

I've been here several times for their breakfast burros which are pretty good.  Today, I decided to do some shopping and wasn't disappointed with either their selection or prices.  This is the only location I know of in the east valley. Would be nice if some more opened up.

Typical filib's food which is decent. What I don't understand is the wait. By the time I order and then get food I could've sat down at an actual restaurant. It took over a half hour to get a burrito and there's not even a drive thru at this location.

Avoid the crowds at Costco and go to SAMs club. Costco is notorious for discontinuing products that you fall in love-with.   The only thing I do not like/appreciate is the guy near the tv's that try to sell me directv packages etc.  or the lady at the checkout line trying to upgrade my membership.   Besides that, it's one stop shopping and bulk quantities.

Stay away from these clowns. Especially Chris Berg and Jason Spears. Let me start of by saying Chris handed me a list of documents needed to complete a refi of my home. He said he'd like the docs returned within 72 hours. I returned them within 24 hours.  After that, I received two emails stating my file had been sent to underwriting and my loan/refinancing should be complete within a few days.  I paid $300 for a home appraisal also out of pocket. Needless to say I never heard back from that scumbag Chris as to why my loan/refi went thru. I had equity in my home, a credit score well over 700.   My review....stay the hell away from ACADEMY MORTGAGE!!!

Not interested Jason, I reached out to you numerous times as well as Chris Berg and you both failed to get back to me or rectify the situation.

$3 for a sandwich. A fresh sandwich fresh ingredients, bread. Not nasty like subway or any other sandwich shop! I frequent Mekong several times a week, getting the #5 chicken sandwich (personal favorite).  Highly recommended

Always fresh. That's why I'm here multiple times a week. Highly recommend the #5 grilled chicken Gà Nuóng.

If you want your pizza smelling like vape or cigarette smoke (not certain which one he was smoking) then by all means order delivery. Some employee driving the white beat to hell Toyota Camry with the shocker sticker was puffing his smoke all over his deliveries. NASTY F'N NASTY!!!!

This place replaced pho 68 which was awesome.   Nam pho , not so much. Ordered the fried egg rolls and a beef pho. Did not even come close to Pho 68.   On top of that the staff/owner was not helpful or friendly. Brought me water& nothing else was offered. Didn't even come back once to check if anything was needed or how the food was.   Also, the front door was open and about 10 flies decided to come inside. I spent most of my time swatting at them.   I will not be coming back.
