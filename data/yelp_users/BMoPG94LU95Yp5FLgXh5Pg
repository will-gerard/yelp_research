Love this place!  With more advertising during Spring training, this place could be an AZ Murphy's.  Go there before a 1pm game and have their great b-fast then take the free shuttle to and back from the game!

After all the hype, went for a girl's night out.  Food was OK, not what I thought of as outstanding.  They only had plastic forks and knives and I couldn't cut my fried chile relleno with it.    Food was OK, but my friend's dish was too spicey.  I  have had better food elsewhere, didn't think the Chinese/Mexican combo was all that noticeable.  I also think if they invested in some nice furniture (instead of plastic chairs) and silverware it might be more appealing.

Great food, has potential, happy hour advertising, maybe a ladie's night would really boost business!

Excellent food, sweet potato fries are awesome, my husband loves the fried egg hamburger!  Great guys that own this place, service is outstanding, great casual drink out night spot for those of us too "old and annoyed" by the Sandbar across the freeway!

After seeing mixed reviews, I deceided to try it.  My husband and I ordered a 14" original crust, sausage w/ 1/2 pepperoni, 1/2 mushroom.  I thought it was very good.  The wheat dough is very yummy and I was even more excited to find out it was only 4 pts for 4 slices on my WW diet.  Very friendly service.  It's not your typical greasy, cheesy pizza which I love as well.  But if you are trying to be health conscious, this is for you.

I have gone to Carie for 5 years since we met when she worked at another salon.  She is amazing, I have had several Brazilian Blowouts and cuts and colors regularly over the years.  She has become a great friend too.  I appreciate that her prices are reasonable and I would recommend her to anyone looking for a great stylist.  Love that she works Sundays too!
