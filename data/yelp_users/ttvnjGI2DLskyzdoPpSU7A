My fiance and I have been coming to German Auto for a couple of years now.  We both drive VW's and these guys know their stuff.  Everyone has been very friendly and helpful each time we have to take our cars in.  Earlier this year they performed a complete checkup of my 2004 Jetta and let me know all the things that I could do to keep this baby running for (hopefully!) another 100,000 miles.  I currently have it in their shop working on it bit by bit as money allows and they have been great about working with me in getting things done over time.  GREAT service with honest people...I will never go back to a dealership.

Unfortunately, this is the 3rd time I've had to use Scottsdale Auto Glass...darn you road rocks!  Today's service was just as great as the other 2 times.  I called Seth at 7:30am with a fresh crack in my windshield, Dennis was here to repair it by 9am and when it couldn't be repaired Greg showed up with a VW windshield at 11:30am and had it installed and the tint strip put on by 12:15.  Seth also called my insurance and had us on 3 way calling so that was quick and easy.  Great, great service!  I hope I never have to use them again...but if the occasion occurs...I would use no one else.

I went to iPic with a girl friend who was here from out of town back when it first opened and we had a blast! Since then, I've been trying to get my fiance to go with me but he thinks it's too expensive.  However, last week was his birthday and he mentioned that he'd like to go see Elysium at iPic.  I was thrilled!  I got online and purchased 2 of the premium seats ($54).  Upon arriving we were happy with our seats and we got settled in for the movie after ordering cocktails and food.  Our server brought us our stuff and we didn't see him again for over 45 minutes.  My fiance was out of beer but still had half of his flatbread left.  I FINALLY was able to wave down another server and asked her if she could please get us another round.  15 minutes later our original server showed up and asked us if we needed anything (uh...yeah...an hour ago!).  We ordered our round from him, as the other server never showed up with our drinks.  And, again, we didn't see our server until he brought us the bill.  Sad to say, I did something that I NEVER do...I tipped him $1 on a $67 check.  That's $67 on top of the $54 I paid for the tickets.  I'm sorry, but if I'm going to pay top dollar for a "premium" experience, I expect premium service.  Maybe iPic should at least install call buttons on their chairs like my preferred theater AMC Esplanade.  Save your money and skip iPic and choose AMC Esplanade.

Great service at this location!!!  Sadly, I forget the name of the girl who spent a solid two hours helping me pick my dress (shame on me)...but she was GREAT!  More recently I worked with Autumn for my alterations and she was a sweetheart.  Autumn gave me great advice on jewelry as well.  I would definitely recommend this location of David's Bridal.

I stopped into the Montauk just for a quick drink with a girlfriend before heading elsewhere for dinner.  I wish I had stayed here for dinner!  Especially with the server that we had, Morgan.  He was SO nice and SO very attentive.  When I do go back...and I will...I will definitely ask to sit his section.  Great beer and wine selection and, honestly, the food menu is calling my name!  Thanks Morgan!  See you soon!
