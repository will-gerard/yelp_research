I go to this subway probably twice a week since it's so close to my work. The staff are always so friendly. I always get the veggie sandwich and it never disappoints me. Love subway!

If there was a option to give 0 stars I would. If I have no choice and have to go to this walmart I have to mentally prepare myself. Every single time I come to this walmart I leave aggravated and empty handed. The employees no nothing about their store, where things are, and don't know English or I can barely understand  them. If they have to ask a manager they walk me across the entire store and to find out the manager doesn't even know if they carry it or where it might be. If I do end up buying something I go to the check out counters and they have 4 operating and they are backed up with customers buying loads and loads of crap and I have one thing. I will never go to this walmart unless I absolutely have to.

Phone cracked last night and needed it repaired ASAP. Recently moved to Vegas and all my friends recommended this place. Walked in and got it fixed within 45 mins. Gave my a screen protector as well. Highly recommend this place! Charged me 76 for iPhone 5 screen replacement. Thanks!

I'm visiting Vegas and my girlfriends and I wanted a solid breakfast. This place is awesome. I got the Sunday morning and added bacon. It was more than enough and left me feeling great. Everyone who works here is very friendly and seems like a family owned place. I will def come here again.

This place is great and pretty much everyone loves it. BUT I go here so much and I think it's healthy and I am sure it is but can you guys please come out with the nutritional facts??? I like to know what I'm eating and what I'm paying for.

This place was disgusting. Came here at the Arizona mills location. I had the chicken chipotle panini. It sounded good. Once I got it and ate half of the sandwich I felt extremely weird and felt like I ate a ton of hormones. Probably in the chicken. Not going there again.
