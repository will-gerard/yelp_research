All I gotta say is....  To-go Salad a la carte 4 buck and some change...get a container that's seriously big enough for enough salad to last me lunch and dinner. Good salad toppings and what not. I stick to the breadsticks...the rest of the breads a little dry.

I go here at least once a week...mostly for wine and beer. They have pretty good deals and carry some brands that even total wine or bevmo don't have.  They also have little chocolates and foods from around the world.  The layout is organized and clean. The stuff they carry will defiantly add a little somethin' somethin' to any house. I'm all for knick knacks, too. I've bought coffee cups, salad bowls and utensils, my big budda for good luck who've i've named kingston, some artwork, curtains, and more bar glasses then I need. My Bf hated me when i came home with a world market bag. Then I would pull out a a beer sampler for him and a bottle of wine for me, all smiles!

44th street office...I've been to a couple clubs and I think the girls are the nicest out of the bunch. Wide variety, little bit of everything. Short, tall, fake, real...Watch out for the couch when you first walk in, it takes a little time for your eyes to adjust. DJs are pretty awesome, rock and hip hop mostly but they do take requests.  SUNDAY NIGHT IS INDUSTRY NIGHT FOR ALL THOSE IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY, ha get it tried to make a funny?   LAST SATURDAY OF EVERY MONTH THEY HAVE A BIG 2-4-1 PARTY WITH TONS OF DRINK SPECIALS, PRIZES, AND A SHITLOAD OF BOOBS :) FREE PORN TOO WITH TITLES LIKE WIDE GAPING BUTTHOLES HOW CAN YOU RESIST?!?! HAHA.

i donno if i just didn't go in on a good day, but eh. We had ordered sichuan beef and general chicken...it tasted exactly the same. Salty and not spicy at all. Fried wontons I couldn't even chew.  The Lettuce wraps were ok...little bland. Only good thing that we ate all of was the hot and sour soup. Everything else we sadly threw away.

I pretty much go every Wednesday for ladies' night. No cover and quarter drinks 6 to 10. By ten, I'm usually a little sloshed anyways. Gives me four hours to sober up. Always packed with the most diverse crowd. Helllooooo a country bar that plays hip hop and what not. I've been retarded and done a contest or two. Only on the nights I run into someone that recognizes me from the club I work at. Booze and a lot of persuasion is a no no. It's a fun bar with some amazing dancers. No need to dress like your going out on the town, its pretty casual. YeeHawww, yo.

Had so much fun tonight!!! Went with a couple girlfriends around 9. Drank and then danced those yummy empty calories away! Went with a lovely co-worker that convinced me to join in on the jersey contest...and I WON! Hundred dollars in my pocket...semi-finals are Dec. 16th if anyone in the area wants to come and support my retardedness. Diverse crowd yet again...anyone fits in here. I love it. Girls are actually nice here....it's hard to find places like that. Tempe or scottsdale...dirrrty looks all around. I don't get it. SPREAD THE LOVE PEOPLE!!!  UPDATE!!!!! I went to the semi-finals....and WON. I went to the finals...and WON!!! I got the cash instead of the PROBOWL Tickets because it didn't include the plane and hotel. O well...it was christmas money and boy it was perfect timing! I love this bar!

I was introduced to Joe's grotto when my friend wanted to go see itis play...and this place is a diamond in the rough. Joe is super nice, and the atmosphere is very laid back. It reminded me of all those underground concerts I went to when I lived over by sunset. Well it ends up the DJ at my work plays in a band with joe called drunk otis. So now I go see them play and watch them get wasted...I was with bad company the first time. Not bad, but trouble for me. Way too much to drink...and a guy friend who kept pulling up my dress to show my ass to the world. Camera guy had a field day. I only wear jeans now...that was my one an only debut. None the less Joe's grotto YoU RoCk.

I'm part Italian...so as much as I love it I am really picky. Maccaronni Grill is Blah, Olive Garden is ok, but Carrabbas is MMM MMm GooD! I went with my friend Matt for the first time and he introduced me to some of the best Italian around my area. I got a glass of Cab. We ordered the Sampler, everything was good, but mostly I ate the calamari. I am mostly into Calamari steaks strips or rings...i don't like the tentacles. Their's I made an exception. The bread they bring out is also very fresh, right out of the oven hot. Salad came with the means and I got the Italian. I forgot to ask for the dressing on the side, but it was really light. Most places put too much dressing. Then we got our meals...CHicken Marsala was amazing. I was already full before the main course came out. If I ate anymore I was going to have to unbutton my jeans. I got a to-go container. Matt orders tiramisu, took one bite and died and went to heaven. Wish I could have ate it, but again I would have had to unbutton my pants. Caution: eating here can lead to happiness and extreme feelings of fullness. I recommend just taking the main course home and going strait to dessert :)  Oh btw only open for dinner.

YUMMY...went here for dinner. It was packed, but what do you expect on a Saturday? I sat down, and no one greeted me for a drink order till the rest of the family arrived. So for a good 15 minutes I sat  with my ID in my hand and some major puppy eyes. I really needed a drink BAD. Long day at work and I showed up early just so that I can order it before everyone got there. For some reason I just can't order booze in front of my grandma. Luckily my dad ordered sake so I was brave enough to order my large sapporo. It was really busy so service was slow, I didn't get my water till after we had already got our food. Boy, did we get a lot of food. My grandma is a garbage disposal, she is a true champ. What did we get.......calamari salad, veg. tempura, heart attack roll, lady special roll, salmon skin roll, edamame, 2 orders spicy tuna roll, eel roll, salmon roll, and himachi kama. I think that's it? I only had some of the heart attack roll which was FABOLOUS!!! Spicy tuna roll is always good and some veggie tempura which was good except the zuccinni it was really mushy and gooey. End of it all, the check was a bill...but it was a ton of food and OOOOO so good. I'd give it 5 stars, but California has way better sushi bars.

I LOVE SWEET TOMATOES...nom nom nom nom NOM! Oh they have a theme that they change monthly and my month of weakness is when they have their tomato soup and grilled cheese bready goodness. I would be embarrased to say that during that month I ate here as much as possible, but I'm going to blame it on the prego hormones. I would drag anyone and everyone here just to stuff my face with its goodness! That month is over, I still go once or twice a month. My stomach can't hold as much food as it used to since the space is currently occupied. My family and friends got sick of it, too, so its harder for me to find people to go with me haha.

I HATE JACK IN THE CRACK...the only time I can eat here is if I've been drinking and everyone in the car is craving it. Not like I got a say I never drink and drive :) so when we all pull up my drunken ass orders something.   THIS PARTICULAR jack just is horrible!!!! The past 3 times!!! Drinks get mixed up...fries are missing...tomatos are there when they shouldn't...foods cold...forget my sauce for the eggrolls :( ya don't judge i tried the eggrolls and they were horrible and dry. And it's really hard to make eggrolls taste bad ,but jack in the box sure was able to do it.

I LOVE SONIC...ok first off I hate fast food. You will rarely find me at McDonalds, Taco Bell, or Carl's Jr. The only time you'd find me at Jack in the Crack is after a night of major partying. Funny how good their tacos taste after you upchuck all those jager and so co shots. I know......ewwwwww grosssss. Anyways my mind's wandering from the point of this all. SONIC I will eat. Helloooo dollar slushies. I could have a limeaid everyday. I usually get the grilled chicken sandwich thingy....i know it's not good for me but it doesn't taste like fast food so it's ok.

Unfortunatly there aren't a lot of craft stores near me, so this is one of my spots for scrapbooking and diy projects. Its always been kind of messy when I go, but I guess with a bunch of little things and a bunch of roaming hands it is easy for things to get all over the place. Scrapbooking stuff they have is nothing special, just your basic stuff. They do have some good sales occasionally.

Used to come out here all the way from Goodyear to meet up with friends. I've had a lot of drunken nights here...so much I took a little break from it all :) It's your typical sports bar. Tons of TVs, $5 Large Drafts, Pool Tables and what not.   Friday/Saturday night don't expect the huge party scene...It mellow just how i like it. No nasty guys grabbing my ass or a line across the room just to use the loo. The very reason why Ii went there for my birthday.  I took one star off just because it took a little long to get orders in for drinks and food, but not gonna b*^ch about it. PS suicide wings are delish...and so are the fried zuccinni.

I feel so bad...I usually order PONG PONG but I thought I would try something new. I cheated. And it was like each has good qualities and bad ones. And now I am in a love triangle...blah.  I really like the veggies!!!! and the chicken quality is better.  but the fried rice and the egg drop was on the salty side.  the Mushus were even....they tasted equally good.  MMMM the cashew chicken and MaPoTOFU soooooooo good :)  My opinion is mostly based on veggies and rice quality so It is a tie. I will just have to alternate between the two till i decide? Oh look at me being naughty lol

Saw this a while back on the show DDD and saw the reviews on yelp so finally took the plunge and went on my first yelp trip. First off...the area is a little scary. I'm not one of "those" girls. I lived in downtown LA right next to the garment district...took the subway to work in hollywood in the middle of the night. Anyways maybe I just went at a bad time where a bunch of ppl hung out outside. I go inside and grab the order form. The people there were really nice and helped me fill it out and was patient enough to help my man over my cell phone. He is such a baby doesn't like to try new things. I swear its all burgers and chicken strips. Anyways I got the bbq pork 'dilla and emerald chicken with black beans and chicken FR. He got the jerk chicken burrito and chicken diablo with jerk FR and black  beans. Everything was good, even got him to try mine which is a miracle itself. The cookies were to die for...diamond in the rough for sure. Next time though, he is going to go pick it up.

ugHHhhhhh just had the spinach enchiladas and some really good maragaritas and I'm so satisfied. If you don't like spinach, their flautas are pretty O worthy. Anyways I could walk to this place, but being on the broke side a little can't afford to eat here too much SOOOOO THANK GOD FOR THEIR BUY ONE GET ONE 1/2 OFF....I went through like a ton of new times and ripped out some of them lol.   Was there last thursday for my birthday. My friend and I drank all day at work and rolled in around 8 and sat at the bar...filled up on chips and salsa(which are yummy) had peach margaritas and ordered food to-go for a little later when we'd be craving it. Bartender was way cool, bought us some shots for my birthday. Had a thing called a DOgma which I regret because I felt it bad the next day. OOOO how i regret it :)

I used to go to Forever 21 at Arrowhead before they expanded and it'd take me a hour at least to go through the whole store. Now that it's like supersized, I'm oddly overwhelmed. I'm just the type to dig and look at everything, sometimes twice ugh life of a fashion design dropout. I go through changes clothes-wise on a monthly basis. SOmedays I'm really girly in a sundress and flats and other days I'm edgy in faux leather short shorts and a cut out rock tee. Forever 21 keeps me from going broke. The clothes here isn't going to last you forever, probaly not even a year. The clothes are  cheaper for a reason, but its cute stuff and looks more expensive then what you paid for while it lasts. The purses and jewelry are my favorite things to get here. They are expanding more and more with their men's line, plus size, and contemporary line now in store. Rumor has it they will be expanding into knick knacks and furniture. However I'm most likely not to buy anything major like a table or a couch if they do...i don't care if the clothes i buy there are done for in a year but that uh i don't need falling apart. NO REFUNDS and limited return policy so TRY EVERYTHING ON...for some reason S, M, L are different for everything there. I'm mostly small but a couple things there I've had to get large. Also I recommend staying away from anything with chains or a lot of beading those tend to be done for after a couple wears.

I love heidi's...it is a little more expensive, but I think it's worth it! When I worked down 83rd...everyone would tell me about this place and finally I went. The people there are really nice and gave me a couple extra coupons to hand out when I got back to work. I love love love their tuna salad...you can get all the fixings but I just like it with lettuce. The sandwich is huge...thats why you have the option of half a sandwich. The bread is delicious, wish I could remember what type it is. It's only open for lunch and it can get pretty busy in here around noon so be warned. There were a couple times I came in on a lunch break took a look at the line and had to bone out and just go hungry for the day *tear* It's bad because you know when you crave something and nothing else sounds good. You get a pickle and a side with your meal..I get the slaw.

This is my go to place for groceries and toiletries. I'll check Safeway to see if they got any WOW SALES but usually Safeway is just riDICulous. I walk into Fry's and every aisle I walk down I have an employee asking how I am doing and If i need help. Sometimes the customers get a little to friendly too...yesterday some dude thought he knew me from some rehab center. I congratulated him and went on my way.  Not something you wanna hear while your looking through Rib-eyes in a crowded supermarket. The Sushi chefs are unappreciated, a lot of people cringe when i tell them i eat fry's sushi. They are really nice, I always buy sushi when they are there because they make my special order of Inari and spicy tuna rolls. Plus the speedy checkout is a plus.

I checked this place out during yelp week. I went and got a hair cut with the beautiful emily b. I felt horrible because I was a little late, but she didn't make a big deal and got started right away. It began  with a deep conditioning treatment and I was amazed...my hair is so thick and crazy and the comb went right through. That is like impossible...give my enough humidity and this little asian is totally sporting a fro. She cut some amazing layers into my hair...I was so scared about cutting length, but it was fine. She was really nice and made conversation! By the time she way done, my hair was run your fingers through it soft and full of bounce and body. My hair is still ridiculously soft and easy to manage. The only problem is my honey won't stop touching my hair...he's touching my head as I type actually. GRRRR.

I Heart UO!!! I wish there was one closer to me though, but I will make the drive. I always get gift card from friends and family because they all know I'm obsessed! This is my go to place for basic tees because they have a longer looser fit and they are incredibly soft and has that worn in feel. I practically live in their burnout raglan...I still regret not getting more because I can't seem to find them anymore. They have a lot of graphic tees that you can't find anywhere else. They have good quality purses and jewelry. It doesn't end there. They got a funny assortment of home goods and books. They sell lomo cameras, which are incredible by the way. Come Christmas time you'll find me here grabbing a bag full of ornaments and stocking stuffers :) The sale section in back is InSane...the prices are a steal. The staff always looks cute...makes me wish I could work there. Me and the retail industry just don't work. Been there, done that.

SuperTaget LOVE  OK so compare uh a  frosty PBR to um lets say a 50 year old bottle of Glenfiddich (I'm a whiskey girl!) That is how I would compare walmart to SUPERTARGET. I do go to walmart and I go in proudly, but its just not as super. MY ONLY PROBLEM IS WHEN I GO I WANT TO BUY EVERYTHING!!! It's an illness, I can't help it. Even if I don't find something....which is rare...I usually end up grabbing a bunch of stuff from those darn dollar bins. The home goods and kitchen stuff are aHHmaZiZIng. My apartment is eventually going to look like it could be in a target ad, which is just sad. They have pretty cute clothes too and I love the fact they have big time designers making brands for target. I don't buy to much food there...I usually just get my veggie chips and soy milk and occasionally check out the Fruit and Seafood selection.  The store as a whole is impeccable with it's cleanliness and the Customer service is wonderful.

I'm like a kid in a candy store, and can put a serious dent in my wallet here. They have a great variety of brands in make-up, perfume, and skincare. The staff for the most part are well-informed and helpful. The best thing with lotions and skincare is you can ask for a sample to take home and try before you make a purchase...because really isn't it a b*&$h when you spend 50 bucks on something that ends up giving you a face only your mother could love.

I'm a little biased because I used to work here a while back. But think of it as an insiders report I suppose. The chefs in back are amazing and they all work extremely hard. They are really great with working with allergies and making sure your food is up to par. I don't know about you but I don't know to may places that offer good gluten free, vegetarian, and meat eater options. The servers are awesome...I met some really great people during my time there. There's a lot more oomph service wise here than other places I've worked. Extensive training on menu items, cocktails, and wines. Just the meal as a whole. Foods good too...and working there i had a lot of experience to kno...a little too much. salt and pepper calamari, chicken noodle soup, spicy eggplant, and chang's spicy chicken were my favs. Ashley( cute momma with short black hair usually with a flower or bow) and Jamie(cute little blond girl) are two of the sweetest girls I know...oooo almost forgot save room for dessert banana spring rolls are ammaaazzing.

There is a personal connection here because when I was younger I got kicked out of my parents house and didn't always have a place to crash. My friend who worked at a walmart said legally I was allowed to sleep in their parking lot because they are always open. I don't know if thats true, but I never had an issue the nights I did have to sleep there. Anyways that was only a couple months, but I have a major love for walmart now...I'm sorry anyone who says they hate walmart is a Liar because I used to be one of those ppl before I gave in. How many places are open 24 hours...not to many. Being a busy girl I NEED THAT OPTION. Ya I'm the weirdo that goes at like 2 am because I work that late and usually don't have the time to go in the morning. This place saved my ass when I needed to pick up baby shower presents and gift cards before waking up 4 hours later to drive out to the party. THANK YOU WALMART.

The closest froyo place by me...and I just discovered it lol which goes to show how much I get out! Anyways I've been a fan of fro-yo since my aunt took me to yogurtland in HI. JuJu Berri is cute and always friendly. The texture varies once in a while, which was odd. I always get my green tea with mochi and blackberries MmMMMM. But I am sad to say I found a yogurtberry on my way to my parents house out in goodyear soooo I might not be going as often :(

I went here for the first time last night. They are promoting an industry night I guess and my Manager grabbed the Bombshells SUV and picked up all us girls so we could party safely. Smack dab in the lovely City North, the bar defiantly has the north scottsdale feel. I walk in and they take us into this roped off VIP area...customer service was incredible. Free Bottle service, Free Appetizers, Free Shots...our waitress had a heavy hand. Think 3/4 booze with a splash of tonic. They had a live band, but it eventually switched off to a dj or something. The crowd was a mix of mid-20 year old all the way to your early 50s. There was one dude totally getting down by himself, he had some short white shorts and a sweatband on his head...can I just say ENTERTAINING! The patio and bar is beautiful. You can smoke on the patio. Nicest bathroom I've ever seen...and the way drinks were coming I saw a lot of it haha.

This cute little place is on my way home from work, so finally I stopped in. Hidden behind the blockbuster, almost didn't find this place. Family owned, customer service was impeccable. I always appreciated family owned places and prefer them to corporate owned places. It's like college football compared to NFL...college has more heart imo. Anyways me and my analogies.  My step-grandmother is Filipino so I was all over the lumpia and adobo. I got a little crazy and had the chicken adobo in a burrito! It was sooo much food, but oooooo so good. I joined them on twitter so I can see the specials. I won't be going in when they got the roasted pig, makes me sad. I got a pet potbelly pig named goose back home. aww he's the love of my life. I need to take someone with me so I can share  dessert...it looked tempting.

Drove down from Goodyear with my parents because Babies R Us didn't have a whole lot of strollers...this store is organized beautifully. It is owned by the same company as Bed, Bath, and Beyond. You can tell. They not only have a much bigger selection, but they have higher quality brands as well. My dad got a little too excited, he was running around looking at more stuff then I was. First-time grandpa moment :) I didn't notice if the pricing is more, less, or about the same as babies r us. It was well worth the drive though and I wish I registered here instead of Babies R Us.

I was really excited to go here after checking out the one in vegas, but I was rather disappointed. I am so glad my mom only got me a 25 dollar giftcard here. I couldn't even find enough to spend that! I did like the men's clothes and the kid's close. For myself, though, eh? the fit was off for me for the few things that I did like, and I'm familiar with euro sizing so that wasn't the problem. I ended up just stocking up on bracelets. oh wells, I will only go to the vegas location.

I'm surprised no one has reviewed this yet. I've been searching for a ob-gyn for like forever. Well ten years at least. I went to see Dr. Sorkin-Wells. My mother goes to her and she is now officially my regular doctor. She is by far the nicest and most caring doctor I have ever had. I've had the worst luck with doctors...weird and creepy. As if it wasn't uncomfortable enough. Anyways my mom went to her because she is one of the best in AZ and has won many awards and titles like best doc in 2003. She is 5+ stars all the way.  I took off one star because on 2 occasions I had problems with billing. But I got it squared away and they took care of it.
