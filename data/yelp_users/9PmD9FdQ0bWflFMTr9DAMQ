I went to this pizza joint based on a word-of-mouth review from a fellow co-worker (who used to frequent the place years ago). He said that their meatball subs were good and he described it as a "nice little spot" that he remembered enjoying.  Looking online for their web site before-hand, I discovered a simple godaddy placeholder page with their logo and address along with a "coming soon" notice. Every business out there needs a web site, and it's especially important to put your restaurant menu online, so this should have immediately been a warning sign for what was to come.  When my friends and I arrived at the Manhattan Pizzeria, we were surprised to discover a total absence of sausage or pepperoni options. Apparently, the restaurant has recently been "koshered" and now only serves vegetarian options and fish-based meats. This came as quite a surprise, because the name of the restaurant was still the same, and we didn't have any fore-warning from their web site.  We decided to roll with it anyways and give it a chance, ordering a couple of slices of pizza with various vegetarian toppings. One of my friends ordered a sub sandwich that had salmon on it.  As we sat waiting at our table, ten minutes went by, then twenty. Right as we were really starting to get antsy (after waiting for almost a full 30 minutes), they brought our pizza slices and the sandwich out to our table. This struck all of us as a bit of an excessive wait. The place wasn't busy with other customers, and the food we ordered was pretty basic. Any decent pizza joint should have been able to toss the various toppings on their pre-made cheese pizza stock slices, pop them into the oven, and deliver them nice and hot to our table within 15 minutes (at the most). The idea of having to wait a full 30 minutes for this really put a damper on the overall lunch experience.  To top it off, the pizza was mediocre at best, and the salmon sub sandwich was a bit bland.  In summary, if vegetarian (or Kosher) pizza, pasta, and sub sandwiches are what you're after (and the idea of fish meatballs sounds good to you), then this is the place for you! Don't go unless you're willing to wait, though.  Also, I *really* think that the new restaurant owners should have completely renamed the place if they were going to take over and completely change the menu the way that they apparently did. Phoenix is a big place with a lot of people who have no doubt gone to the Manhattan Pizzeria over the years, and if you keep the same name, they are going to expect the same experience and the same types of food that they had in the past. Completely changing the name would have avoided the disappointment of un-met expectations.

My car died while I was driving to work, and a search for nearby auto repair places turned up this shop. It had good reviews so I decided to give them a shot.  I had my car towed to their shop using my GEICO roadside assistance, and the guys at 25th Street Automotive had it up and running again within the same day (I had a busted alternator). Their free shuttle took me back to my home for the afternoon, and then they came and picked me up later on when everything was ready to go.  When I came to pick up my car, they took the time to point out the fact that they had noticed that my radiator hoses were almost completely worn out (which I could see to be true), but they didn't insist on fixing it right then or there. They took the time to educate me about the issue and the potential costs, but they left the decision entirely up to me.  One other thing I noticed was that as part of the alternator repair, they had completely cleaned up my battery terminals and painted them with an anti-corrosion treatment. This was an unexpected attention to detail which I really appreciated.  Summary: Top notch, prompt service from friendly, knowledgeable, and skilled mechanics. At no point did I feel like I was being scammed or upsold things I didn't need, and the price I paid for this level of service seemed fair to me. I'll definitely be coming back!

I've lived just down the street from Mamma Mia's for almost 3 years now, and it's been my favorite pizza place ever since I discovered it. The prices are just right (two slices and a drink is enough to fill anyone up, and it's only around $5). The owner (Frank) is friendly and always remembers my name when I come in, even when they're crazy busy!   Added bonus: Immediately next door is a small alcohol store where you can grab some beer (if you're getting your pizza to go). And what goes better with pizza than beer?  The only downside I've noticed is that their full-size pizzas tend to be somewhat limp in the middle. I always get slices (which are cooked by themselves), so that's never really an issue for me.

I'm a huge fan of Padre's! What food I've tried (I mainly just order tacos or their pork sliders usually) is delicious, the bartenders are awesome, and the owners are always friendly!  One of my favorite things to do: Order two tacos and half a bowl of guacamole with chips and salsa.

Tried coming here for lunch today and at noon, it was totally dead. Only saw one employee in the whole place, who promptly disappeared after instructing us to sit wherever we wanted. Not a single other customer was there, and there was no sushi chef behind the bar or anything. They also didn't have any lunch specials. Everything was full price. Maybe that's why no customers were there?  While waiting for someone to show up and take our order, we noticed that the paper menu on our table was wrinkled and filthy. Upon further inspection of our table, we realized that the platters and soy sauce bowls in front of all three of us were dirty. I picked up the bowl in front of me and scraped off various different bits of dried on food, and so did my companions.  We got up and walked out. A place that serves raw fish should have very high standards of cleanliness, and Moira appeared to be woefully lacking in that regard. Very disappointing.

I went here with my younger brother around 1:30 PM on a Wednesday afternoon (basically right when one would expect the lunch rush to be slowing down). At first glance, I was like, "Wow! This place is huge!", however, I quickly realized that the illusion of being a huge buffet was produced by full size mirrors on the walls next to the buffet bars and that in reality, they actually only have 4 or 5 buffet bars.  As for the food, it was mediocre at best. I couldn't even cut the orange chicken with my fork (it was so tough), and their sushi bar was a complete joke. I could hardly find any actual raw fish anywhere in the sushi rolls (it was all just imitation crab meat ), and the actual rolls were very gummy and rubbery when eaten. I didn't get a chance to try the Mongolian BBQ station, which might be why my opinion is so low, but I've never been much of a fan of Mongolian BBQ anyways.  The Good: Their Lo Mein noodles were delicious, and I thoroughly enjoyed their egg rolls (which were actually more like spring rolls). A number of the other food options I sampled (such as the cream cheese wantons and the stuffed mushrooms) were rather enjoyable.  Summary: For a $6.49 lunch, this place is not bad. If you like Mongolian BBQ, and want to eat a ton of food, I'm willing to bet that you will thoroughly enjoy this place. If you are wanting sushi from a buffet, however, I would strongly recommend you go elsewhere.

The DawgFather Grill is just around the corner from my office, so it was only a matter of time until I decided to go check it out.  When I first went there, the woman behind the corner surprisingly didn't seem all that enthused about the hot dogs, so I took her advice and got the philly cheesesteak sandwich. It was ok, but I didn't really think it was all that great. As such, I resolved to actually try a hot dog the next time I came.  When I next visited, I ordered one of their big dawgs (1/4 lb angus beef) with all the toppings (ketchup, mustard, onions, relish, and shredded cheese). I also ordered a normal-sized version of one of their Jersey dawgs, which is deep fried and has only mustard on it.  Summary: The Big Dawg was simply delicious, and perfectly matched my definition of a good hot dog. The Jersey Dawg was ok, but the normal-sized hotdog just seemed ridiculously thin in comparison to the Big Dawg... so do yourself a favor and only ever order the Big Dawg size.  One downside: If you are traveling south on Central, this place can be a bit of a pain to get to since you have to do a u-turn at the next intersection (just to get over the light rail). If you're going north on Central, however, it's super-easy to drop in real quick, grab a hotdog, and head on your merry way.
