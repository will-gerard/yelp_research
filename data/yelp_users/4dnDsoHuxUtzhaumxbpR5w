I grew up eating Chico's Tacos (I'm not old, lol), and it's definitely one of my favorite quick Mexican food joints. The salsa bar is fantastic. I suggest the beans (no lard!), shredded beef tacos, the Achiote Chicken Salad (yum!), the cheese enchiladas....  I need to add though, Management changed last year and they sadly adopted flashy, in-your-face menu boards and jacked their prices a bit. No bueno. I haven't been much since it changed but it's still good.

This is one of my all-time favorite places to grab a quick (and casual) bite downtown. The service is consistently excellent, and the owners are extremely friendly. They are flexible with their menu, too - they do their best to get you exactly what you want.   I recommend the stuffed avocado salad. It's a special, and boy is it amazing. The fruit here is also superb - always so fresh! My friends and I swear they have someone designated to just cut fruit all day, it's so fresh. The hummus is the best hummus in town. Get it with extra veggies!  The only downfall Athenian has is it's hours. Monday thru Friday til 5, closed on the weekends. No fun for those of us who live in the area. But other than the short hours, this is one of my favorite places in the area - I would recommend it to anyone.

I lived in Coronado for several years and my family and I frequented this place a lot. The owners know my dad pretty well, and they are always super friendly to my brother and I. They have a pretty decent wine selection now, since the neighborhood began to show interest in it. They carry all the norms as far as snacks go, but then they have their selection of foods you might need but don't want to go all the way to the grocery store to get. They also have hot pickles that I crave on a regular basis.   I don't live in the neighborhood anymore so I don't come here as often, but for the locals it's a must. Or even if you're in the area.....

Oh my jesus is this place fantastic. I experienced Ranch Market for the first time last summer. I'm not familiar with the holiday, but it's the one where they bake tons of cakes with little babies in them..? Someone help me here. Back to the point, it was EXTREMELY festive, and I don't know if it was the heat, or that I was tired, or that the place was just so decked out in colors and people and decorations, but I got sick. Sick to where I had to wait outside by the car for my company. Hilarious. Needless to say I was a little frightened, so it took a little while for the curiosity to pique again.   Second time was yesterday evening. Perhaps it was because instead of being a busy Saturday it was a slower (still busy, though) Tuesday that I was able to survive this visit. The boy decided to use it for a school project so I tagged along to see if I could help. The second we walked in the door however, all hope in my helping him was lost. My mind was in a frenzy as I decided where to stop first. The Jugeria for some Horchata? Or the restaurant for some asada? Or maybe the bakery for something sweet...?   Found out the Horchata is way too sweet (but delicious) to drink alone so I shared with the boy. Grabbed some kind of sweet roll from the bakery that we practically fought over...and oh my! It was Taco Tuesday at the restaurant! I ordered 4 asada tacos for $2.99 and thanked the lord my boy is a vegetarian. Best carne asada ever!   And the atmosphere in here is great. Oh! And they're open late. 6a-11p. The employees are friendly and the customers (mainly families) are just so full of life and happiness (or maybe it was the Spanish music blaring on the loudspeaker?). All in all, this is a new fave. I will most definitely be looking into more of the daily specials and sweet rolls.

I'm not sorry that I love this zoo. I have many fond memories here.  Yes, it's a smaller zoo, and yes, they are somewhat lacking in good animal watching..but come on people, six months out of the year it's blazing hot outside. They can only do so much.   I recommend coming here on a beautiful spring day. If it's hot outside, you'll hate it. Bring your bike, too. I used to bring my bike and just ride around all day.

This place is awesome. They have the best selection of independent and foreign films. The staff is always so helpful and knowledgable. It's overflowing with that laid-back, downtown homegrown vibe. It's fabulous!  I will warn you though - this place is difficult to get to right now with all of the lightrail construction on Central. Don't let this stop you - you'll be missing out if you do!

One of my double jogger stroller tires went flat a few months ago so naturally I just avoided the situation and stopped using it altogether. Because that's the sensible thing to do, right? Child, desperate for some outside time, a healthy dose of Vitamin D, and a little neighborhood exploration: "Mom, let's go for a really long walk today! Let's find some treasures! It's so nice out!" Me, worst mom ever: "We can't! The stroller's broken! I don't know what to do!" Finally, I'd had enough with my laziness. The perfect weather, my children's cries of despair were getting the best of me. That fucking stroller tire wasn't going to ruin my life! I broke down. I put on my best mom-face  and pulled that beast of a stroller out of storage, awkwardly heaved it's huge, heavy ass into the tiny trunk of my car, and desperately rolled it into Sun Cyclery. "Please help me!" I begged. "My children are being deprived the beautiful outdoors, this Arizona sunshine, endless treasure hunting... their childhoods!" The wonderful gentlemen at Sun Cyclery assured me all would be well and gingerly wheeled my jerk of a stroller to their back room for repair. Five minutes passes, ten minutes, then fifteen...as we're coming up on twenty I start biting my nails, pacing the showroom, worrying, "what if they can't fix it? What will this mean for my children? My children, who are perfectly capable of walking on their own but can't walk more than a few blocks at a time? What will this do to their adventurous spirits, always longing for more? Further, Mom! Furtherrrrr!!!" I CAN'T EVEN HANDLE.   Turns out, that little sucker of a tire was loads more difficult to remove than the professionals of Sun Cyclery ever imagined. More difficult than some of their bikes, they say! And to think, I originally thought my only two options were a) never use that bastard again or b) make your husband do it and probably ruin your marriage over what would've been the Biggest Pain in the Ass Tire Repair of All Time. And you know what the repair cost at Sun Cyclery? A mere $25. TWENTY. FIVE. DOLLARS. Worth every freaking penny, I tell you. Twenty-five dollars and I was basically buying back my kids' childhoods.  So, in conclusion, I'd first like to thank that tiny part of my sleep-deprived brain that refused to believe options A and B were even options at all. Bravo, brain! Thanks for pushing through. Secondly, and most importantly, I'd like to thank the heroes at Sun Cyclery for saving my sanity. My children's juvenescence. And probably my marriage. You know, basically my life.

What ever happened to Buffalo being "vintage" and "affordable"? The stuff here is usually crap, but if you have enough time to dig through the racks and racks and racks of stuff you may be able to find yourself a decent item or two. But wait! I can almost guarantee that that decent item will be over-priced and/or low in quality. Or something you can purchase NEW at an actual store for the same price.   I have to admit though I have sold lots of old stuff here. I used to take the credit and hunt for something worthy, but it never seemed to work out so I ended up just taking the cash.   Oh and another thing -if you're looking for designer jeans this isn't a bad place to look. You can usually find them anywhere from $60 to $85 a pair. Better than fighting at Last Chance!

I've been selling at Buffalo for several years now, and while sometimes I walk away with a pocket of cash and others not so much, I've learned how to judge pretty well what they're looking for (seasonal items, condition, etc).   After a good closet cleaning, I decided to bring a couple of bags of what I thought worthy down to BE. Let's see, after scrutinizing most pieces for a good 2 minutes, asking other sales associates to look things over, etc, I was able to sell five items - three with tags still attached. Guess how much "cash" they offered me? TEN DOLLARS. Ten dollars for FIVE items. Ten dollars for 2 dresses, 2 new tops, and 1 new belt. Are you freaking kidding me? What a rip! That means, if ten dollars is 35% of the trade, all five items will retail for a total combined cost of what, less than $35? What a total scam. Silly me was so shocked I just took my joke of a trade and left, but now I'm kicking myself for not demanding an itemized receipt to see what my items will "really" retail (cause they sure as hell won't only cost a combined $35).  Also, I brought in this gorgeous yellow 100% silk dress purchased at Anthro for over $100, and they said that if I dry cleaned it and brought it back (to remove 2 TINY spots on the bottom hem of the dress) they would purchase it from me - for SEVEN DOLLARS. So I'll spend $8 to dry clean it and then sell it for $7? Silly me but that just doesn't seem to add up.   Seriously, Buffalo, stop ripping people off. You just look like a jerk.   People, if you're not worried so much about the money aspect and are just looking for a change in wardrobe, organize a Frock Swap with a huge group of friends. You're bound to find way cooler items for no cost at all, and it's super fun to boot. Or, if you are worried about money, consign with other shops (for example, My Sister's Closet), but sure as hell don't do business here.

This Michaels is awful. Really, really terribly. If it weren't the ONLY craft supply store in the Central Phoenix area I would never, ever come here. I'm drawn here when I need that one damn thing to finish a craft/sewing project and I don't feel like driving the 25 minutes to JoAnn's at Desert Ridge.   The place is always a mess and they're constantly out of so many items. Also, they're sticklers about taking coupons which makes it that much more annoying. (JoAnn's will take like, a bazillion coupons, including competitors' coupons, in one transaction.)

Texaz is the absolute best place in this city to get a delicious, affordable steak. Sure, it's not fancy schmansy, and the service isn't outstanding, but  it's damn good food. Mashed potatoes smothered in white gravy with a medium filet that's grilled to perfection (not to mention wading in it's own pool of grease), is what I call home-cookin'. The chicken fried steak is also marvelous.   It's usually pretty busy at night, and they only have a couple of tables for larger parties. Not sure if they take reservations. The feel in here is great. Extremely laid back. The perfect place to go if you're looking to get some greasy, messy grubbin' on.

Oh, Luke's. How dangerously delicious you are. I have to agree with other Yelper's on Luke's...great Italian sausage and beef. I usually don't order any sides with anything, considering the sandwich itself is a heart attack. The chili dog is also great, but it's more than messy so I warn you - eat it with a fork and knife as best you can.   Service is usually just alright. Sometimes I feel like more of a pain than a customer, but hey, whatever. I also agree with Kevin H. that their to-go packing sucks. The two times I've taken to go I get home and find my entire lunch jumbled around the bag. No bueno.  But, if you're looking for a great hot dog, sausage, beef, whatever you want to call it - Luke's will definitely help you out.

I love love love Arriba. Their happy hour is the best. They're margaritas are magnificent. On the rocks, extra salt, please!  I'm also slightly obsessed with the White Sands Chimichanga. Delish!  Service however is slightly disappointing. The servers are either not there or too in your face. There needs to be a balance, people!

I love love love this place. If I could afford it, I would eat here more often. The sandwiches are fabulous. Best ingredients out there and amazing breads. You can also pretty much add/exclude anything you want to any sandwich. The soups are always delicious, as well as their side salads and pastas.   I love the feeling and atmosphere of the place. Very homey and welcoming. They also have several different patios around the restaurant, which is nice. Not to mention a glorious cheese selection, wine/beer bar, and espresso.   It's a bit pricey, and if you go during the lunch hour any day of the week (including weekends), especially during the nice season, expect to wait more than just a few minutes for your food. Otherwise, though, this place is a hidden (it's tucked away in the plaza) wonder.

Best sushi I've ever had in town, hands down. Zen 32, Ra, and all those other places do not even compare. There is never a wait at the sushi bar and the service is awesome. Same servers/chefs have been there forever and give the place a great vibe. They also have a great happy hour. I recommend the Senorita Roll, it's half off!   Have only dined in the "restaurant" once, and it was so long ago I don't quite remember. Stick with the sushi.

This store is too busy. Don't get me wrong, I love my Mac more than anything but the service at this store is god-awful. Luckily before purchasing my Mac I researched until I knew exactly what I wanted. I seemed to know more than the associate that helped me! Purchasing it was more of an awkward affair - I couldn't wait to get out of there.   Also, it's always almost impossible to get into the Genius Bar. My iPod malfunctioned sometime earlier this year and after waiting in the store for 45 minutes to be seen, I was only informed that the damages were more in depth than they thought and I would need to schedule an appointment. It's just an iPod, people! The experience itself was more than frustrating. I stick with Amazon on this one.

The Hubbs took me here for Valentine's dinner. At first glance the place is a little strange - nice table settings...plastic chairs?? Really pricey...plastic chairs?   Anyhow, the service was great and the food wasn't too shabby either. We ordered the black bean fritters for an appetizer (OMG YUM!!!!) and a couple of drinks. The drinks were strong, but good. Hey more for your money, right? I ordered the Cuban pot roast and the Hubbs ordered the Chayote Curry Squash. Honestly, I could have just eaten 23782 orders of Black Bean fritters and been okay. My pot roast had a good flavor, but the meat was so completely overdone I almost contemplated sending it back (we were late for a show). The Hubbs' dish was good, a little on the sweet side, but I guess that's Cuban food for ya. Oh - we found the squash sticker in the rice...the manager was nice about it, but didn't say sorry or offer anything (not that we expected it, it's not like it was a fingernail).   Dessert on the other hand was heavenly. Absolutely heavenly. I had the bread pudding (OMG OMG OMG) and the Hubbs ordered the papaya pastry. SO GOOD. Next time I think I'll skip the entrees altogether and just go for drinks, apps, and dessert.   I'll be back, either way.

Tortillas. Enchiladas.   OAXACA SPECIAL.  Don't go during lunchtime. Lines are outrageous and if it's during the summer the heat is unbearable (no a/c). Go in with an open mind.

Now I haven't had much experience with Thai Food, other than several random Pad Thai dishes at several random places (which through this place I found aren't even close to being authentic, lol). Anywho, I've been here twice and both times had the Satay appetizer, Tom Kom (?) soup, red curry bowl and the Coconut Princess dish. Holy moses, is the soup delish. I crave it on a regular basis. They have this unique spice "meter" which ranges from 1-5 and the soup on a 2 is fantastic. Not too spicy, not too mild.  The Satay is great. I would recommend it to people who aren't too familiar with Thai food and want to start out easy. The red curry with beef is fantastic and the Coconut Princess...ooooh, the Coconut Princess. The Princess is like an extended version of the soup except you get lots of veggies, some meat, and rice. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Maybe I'll drag the boy and venture the nearly 30 miles this evening...  ****UPDATE: So rather than venturing for dinner last night, my cousin and I did the lunch bit this afternoon. I was extremely excited about it and couldn't wait to get my hands on some soup and that red curry. So the two of us are seated, we order our food, enjoy our soup, and receive our entrees. This is where it begins.  My cousin ordered the garlic tofu. Having much experience with Thai food, she could instantly tell the tofu was completely over cooked. No biggie, we thought, just explain you didn't like it and would like something else instead. So we catch one of the bussers and ask if we may have something else. She takes the dish and is gone for a couple minutes. Our server then brings the dish back, drops it on the table, and demands to know why she didn't like it. She explains the tofu is overdone and she would just like to try something else. The server stands there saying nothing, she looks at her for some kind of explanation. Not knowing what to say (we've never had this happen before), I speak up and say, "She would like something else, can you please just exchange it?". The server rolls her eyes, picks up the dish and walks to the back to ask "the owner" if that will be okay.   Meanwhile, my cousin and I sit there, completely shocked by her reaction. So after a few minutes the server comes back, sets the plate of cold tofu down once AGAIN in front of her, shoves a menu in her hands and says, "What do you want now?". Feeling accosted and uncomfortable, she flips through the menu with the server standing over her. She says she would not like anything else and asks that she send it back and just take it off of our bill.   I swear to god at this point I thought the servers eyes were going to melt our faces off, she was so livid. She rolls her eyes, throws her hand onto her hip and goes off on some tangent about how Thai food "is different than other food" and is "more expensive", and that they don't take items off the bill no matter what the complaint. Unfortunately, at this point she was causing such a scene that our neighboring tables were turning their heads and staring. I looked at her and said, "we have never had this problem in any restaurant before, we are not eating this and we are not paying for it". She replies with, "Oh, so you return food all the time at restaurants then??" and laughs. She walks away, comes back almost immediately with our check, opens it, throws it down on the table (literally, she threw it) and says "HERE! We took the dish off!". She turns around and starts talking shit about us five feet away with another server.   At this point we were completely livid and feeling rather harassed, so we left a $20 (no tip, I might add) and our food, got up and left.   The whole experience mad me so sad, I was really looking forward to it and loved their food. Sadly, I will never eat here again.

I LOVE this venue! I had been dying to see something here for years, and finally we saw Regina Spektor last fall. The tickets were a little pricey but they were more than worth it.   All I can honestly say is that her performance changed my life. I don't know if it was the beautiful venue, her powerful voice, or the perfect ambiance, but something left an impression on me. You know, like the feeling you get after watching a really deep movie.   I highly recommend seeing anything here.

I totally love Hamburger Works. They have the best wings in town. Beware of the Hot, though, they'll kick your butt. Order them crispy and enjoy. The burgers are so-so, not the greatest, but still good. They have a small salad bar, so you can either get a salad, or load your burger up with whatever goodness you want. They have a rather large menu, mostly burgers and sandwiches, accompanied by the typical fried appetizer type foods - think mozzarella sticks, fried zucchini and mushrooms, chili cheese fries, the whole bit.   Service is a little slow, but nice because you know you're not exactly eating "fast food". There are plenty of tables for parties of different sizes, and there's a bar, too. I have to admit, it's a little pricey for how dive-y it is, but it's worth it.

I've had several piercings done here - the service has been great every time. Yes, I can agree with other Yelpers that sometimes the staff can be slighty condescending with their words of advice, but seriously? Get over it, they're just doing their job.   Jewelry selection is fabulous and the prices are reasonable. I recently ordered a nose ring and after waiting several weeks for it to arrive, I get it home to find that it is way too big! I figured because all jewelry is a final sale an exchange would be hopeless, but I called and explained (and I think they were leniant due mostly to the fact that they recommended the size, but still) and they exchanged it for me no problem.

The boy and I had dinner here last Wednesday night. I had only ever had take out from here, but have heard rave reviews so we decided to check it out. It's easy to miss, being located in a seedy strip mall next to a poker/strip club type bar?? We were the only ones in the restaurant, the entire hour or so we were there. So I am going to assume it's quiet on the weeknights?   Anyhow,  I had the wonton soup which was fabulous!! I ordered the small and was surprised at how much it filled me up. Both the boy and I ordered fried rice, he Veggie and I the House. They were both very good. However the House rice came with baby shrimp and majority of them were still "veined" I guess you could say. I ended up picking those out....   Now the service.... AMAZING! Judging by other Yelpers' reviews it was the owner (she served us) and she was the sweetest little old lady I have ever met. She called me by my first name when handing back my credit card. Who does that?! Fabulous.

Forever 21 is the absolute best place to find affordable, trendy clothes and jewelry/accessories. While their products are not of the best quality, they have the largest selection and the clothes are extremely low priced! It's a great place to go if you are just looking to buy a few things to spruce up your wardrobe without empyting your bank account. And their jewelry is amazing - they have the funnest items for mostly $10 and under. I love love love this store.

We've been to more than several shows here and I can honestly say I've never been disappointed. The sloped floor is nice, as well as the random chairs. The big bar up front is convenient if you know how to fight for a drink. The patio isn't too bad if you don't mind cigarette smoke.   Parking is pricey. If you live in the area, ride your bike or walk!

My fiance and his brother are both veggie boys. The brother being a vegan. So naturally, they love this place. Me, however, being the hungry carnivore that I am, can't get so much into the food. I've had a couple of their tofu-meat-imitation dishes (burger, chicken wings) and I just couldn't do it. If I'm going to eat something that looks like meat, it's going to be meat! Same with cheese, the vegan cheese here is a little funky. But hey,  that's just me. Like I said, the boy and his brother love it.   The decor is cute and inviting. The staff is laid back and they're all really nice. The one thing I come here for though, (besides tagging along with the boys) are the vegan tsoynamis. SO GOOD. I recommend every flavor. Now, I CAN get into soy ice cream. These things are what make Green worth it to me. Yum yum yum.

Oh Urban, how I used to love you.   I don't know if it was the discovery of Forever 21, or that magnificent Nordy's card, but Urban has lost much of it's appeal. This location in particular is overly crowded with boring, over-priced clothes, and enough platinumblondei'mtryingsohardtobeindie ASU students to make me want to gag myself with a spoon.

Feeling like I needed a color change, I scheduled an appointment here with Shaya (through reference of a friend).   I had never been to Altered Ego before today and I must say, it is absolutely adorable. The salon is decorated to have a very home-y, rustic feel, and the employees are all super friendly.   I didn't know what exact color I was looking for, so Shaya was extremely helpful in explaining my different options. I decided on a rich, dark copper brown...it turned out beautifully. I will most definitely be visiting Shaya again.   The price was extremely affordable and the service was beyond excellent. I recommend it to everyone!

I love Kiss the Cook. I don't know if it's the sweet childhood memories of Sunday breakfast with my grandparents after church, its country chic charm, or its old school location near Downtown Glendale, but I just love it.   I've been here countless times and it's always a pleasure. The food is good for what it is, and cheap to boot. I think the last time we had breakfast here our tab was a whopping $13 (excluding tip). And we ordered a ton of food (the hubs had to order a million sides to get what he wanted). The biscuits and gravy is always delicious and served piping hot (the only way to eat it). Everything else is pretty standard breakfast fare, and the basket of mini muffins is always a delight. Lunch is good, too.   If you're in the area, or looking for a unique experience, definitely visit Kiss the Cook. Then head over to Downtown Glendale for some antique and boutique shopping and old town sightseeing.

I have had much Last Chance experience over the last couple of years. I hate it, but I am addicted nonetheless. I'll admit, it's always a terrible experience, but leaving with that Betsey Johnson leather handbag that retails for over $400, that you purchased for $80, is pretty damn exciting. Same goes for designer jeans, Sevens for $30, Joe's for $20, True Religions for $60, Rock and Republic for $30....I think you get the point. Shoes, too. There are tons of shoes. I once found an immaculate pair of Jimmy Choo's for $100. Seriously?? Seriously.   I'm not so up-to-date with the Men's section, although I do know it is harder to find good stuff. Shoes are a biggie.   The best advice I can give to a Last Chance newbie: arrive EARLY. The open at 9?? I believe, perhaps 9:30, Monday thru Friday. Arrive an hour early or so and find yourself a spot at the front of the gate. Before opening, the place fills up with so many people that if you aren't up front there isn't much hope of getting anything. Also, set yourself on heading straight to one department. Do not go in thinking you're going to find a pair of jeans, amazing pair of shoes, and that cocktail dress you've been wanting, cause it's not going to happen. If you are looking for shoes, get yourself into that shoe department first and look fast. Once you are done with the shoes, mosey on over to the jeans...and then the dresses. Just know that you can't do it all at once so it's good to focus on one department at a time. You also need to expect to be here a while..it takes time finding all those bargains.   Make sure to inspect all of your merchandise before purchasing it. Like, really inspect it, make sure it's perfect (or repairable), they have a NO return/exchange policy...so you better like what you're buying.   My last note: they put merchandise out all throughout the day. Maybe you missed those jeans in the morning cause you were caught up in the shoes...don't worry, they have designated times (they won't tell you, though) where those jeans will come again..take the day off and just hang out.

The attitude here is a little too elite for my taste.   However, I love that it is open late and they also happen to have the best damn sweet potato fries in town (think aioli!). The burgers are the only way to go here, I've had the tuna sandwich and the fish was horribly dry. As well as the veggie wrap. The salads are mediocre for their price.   Def stick with the burgers.

Yeah, 2go doesn't quite hit the spot with me. The food is too expensive and underdone to take out - you may as well eat at Delux or go get the sushi at Zen (by the way, don't, it's terrible). The deli sandwiches are nothing more than what you'd find at Safeway, for a few bucks more. The cupcakes are extremely tiny for the $3 asking price, and not so good. I'd rather hit up Tammie Coe. However, I do like their wide selection of bottled beverages.   The service here is usually horrendous. Sarcasm and bad attitude every time. Sorry that I asked for extra aioli and you forgot the first time, so I had to ask again... It's obvious the girls working this place hate their jobs - I imagine they feel a little left out of next door's happenin's.   Delux2go was a great concept, but it seems someone veered a little off course during the construction. The selection is too vast and it ends up looking sloppy. If you're going to do Delux, you're better off eating at the actual restaurant, where the atmosphere and service (not to mention you get to eat your food right off the grill) is 100% better.

The food here is worth all of the negatives- the wait, the service, the atmosphere. Sometimes you just need that hearty breakfast to start your day, and Palatte just won't succeed.  I recommend everything here. Seriously, everything. Especially the Daily Specials.

Tammie Coe is nothing but pure, sugary sin. Blissfulness!! I've had several of her cakes (birthdays), and my god, they are truly amazing. They are small and pricey, yes, but they are so rich that a little goes more than a long way.   I suggest anything and everything here. The croissants are heavenly. As well as the Berry Tarts. The Ooey Gooeys are a little heavy on the frosting but the cake is amazing. Try the Betters cookie. Or the Blueberry Banana Bread. Or their sandwiches! The Portobello..or the Uncle Louie. All of it is fabulous.   I'm getting married in September, and we have already decided the only worthy baker is Tammie Coe. Check our their wedding cakes online!  Yum yum yum...oh how we love you Tammie Coe!

Awesome festival. Crazy costumes, fun performances, lots of souvenirs, bonsai trees, crazy anime kids, and lots of food. The boy and I went Sunday and it was outrageously busy. We walked around for a while, picked up some steam buns and kaluei (?) ice, and did some people watching. It was a good time.

I like IKEA for many reasons. I won't list them because fellow Yelper's have already done so.   I must warn you though, don't travel here on a weekend. It is PACKED. Like, you can't push your cart anywhere and you have to walk a mile through the parking lot to get into the place. And also, stay away from their self-checkout stands. I had a huge issue with them a few months ago where I was double-charged and IKEA was extremely fussy and difficult in returning my money.

Piestewa (formerly known as Squaw) Peak is an amazing workout. I'll admit it, it kicks my butt a little. But that I like to blame on asthma and the terrible pollution in this city. But seriously, it's a great way to get your tush movin'.  It's crazy-out-of-control busy on weekends when the weather is nice. Parking is an absolute nightmare. Expect to park a ways away, unless of course you're like me and stalk people with your car......   Also, if the sun is up, expect to fry like an egg on hot pavement. Wear sunblock!! As well as hats and/or sunglasses. I've made the mistake of not wearing sunblock and yeah...not good!! But I guess if you live in Phoenix that's a must anyway. Just remember!  If you're not up for the summit, there are tons of back trails to hike throughout the park. They're easier and usually less crowded. Bring your kids, too, I saw more than several little ones practically running to the top no problem. If only I could do that....

The hubby and I stayed here on our wedding night. We didn't arrive until midnight or so (we partied late :)) and the service was still impeccable. After our car was valeted and we were golf-carted down to our casita, we were left to enjoy our night of solitude. The room itself was beautiful; king sized bed, fireplace, patio overlooking the golf course, vanity, ipod dock, jetted tub, separate shower, and plush robes and slippers.   We ordered room service probably close to 1 am and it arrived promptly. The boy ordered the veggie wrap (he said it was delish) and I ordered the tossed greens salad with balsamic. For $13 the salad was a total miss. Just a few mediocre lettuce leaves, tomatoes, onions, and cucumbers thrown on a plate. I was hungry though, so it worked.  The next morning we slept in as late as we could. I woke up with the worst heartburn (thanks, balsamic!) so I called the front desk for some Tums. No problem, they arrived pronto. We packed up and called for a ride, and although they said they were busy, they arrived shortly after.   I would love to come back here and stay a little longer. The service was great, the place was beautiful, and for the one night we were there it was damn perfect.

Quick n Clean is the perfect car wash because 1) you get to vacuum and clean the inside of your car yourself. I am especially grateful for this because I am always disappointed with the interior when someone else does it...I usually have to go over it again myself, which makes no sense if I just paid someone so I wouldn't have to. So naturally, I love that option. 2) It's FAST. Granted, you don't have someone washing your car by hand, but who cares, the drive-thru probably does a better job anyway. And comparing this system and it's cleanliness to other gas station type places, this drive-thru definitely takes the cake. And 3) It's cheap! However, it's not as cheap as it used to be. I went today for the first time in months and whaddyaknow it's a whopping six bucks! It used to be three, then five, and now six I suppose. But whatev, it's still less than going to some ghetto do-it-all-yourself place and spending who knows how much in quarters. Plus it's a lot less work.   They offer several different wash options, as well as detailing. I have only ever purchased the $6 (cheapest) "Express Wash", but the upgrade washes are usually pretty hoppin' too. There seems to be a ton of employees working, which can be somewhat obnoxious when they start pitching you windshield repairs and sales, but then again, they run a smooth operation so I'm thankful for their presence.

I dined at this location a couple times while it was Cafe del Sol (delish!), but recently decided to meet a friend here for lunch and give Fuego a whirl.    The place was almost empty, maybe 2 or 3 parties of two. Our server was nice, a little slow, but nice. I ordered the fish tacos and mi amiga ordered the empanada.   The food was great. The tacos were marvelous. Flavorful and succulent. Mmm. Unfortunately, I ate everything on my plate and didn't feel completely satisfied. For a $10 lunch plate I was a little bummed. Oh well.   Have yet to try dinner, but the husband and I have a couple of VIP cards for entrees so we'll have to hit it up soon.

Can't stand Cricket. It's overpriced, overcrowded, and overheated. For some reason the good shows only travel through here during the unbearable summer months, which means if you can only afford a lawn ticket you're totally screwed.

I can't stand the way everyone hyped this place up when it first opened. It's way too overpriced for the cheap, lifeless ingredients they use. The food they serve here is similar to something you can buy ready-to-eat in a bag from a grocery store. Like the salad for example, they give you this huge mound of iceberg mix. Okay, I could have purchased this at the store, thrown it on a plate, and for half the price! Trendy decor isn't the only thing you need these days to run a restaurant, people!

I freaking love Sprouts. The produce is here is so obnoxiously cheap and fresh. And with the boy being an herbivore and all, it helps keep the bills down. Seriously though, 3 bulbs of garlic for 98 cents, 3 red bell peppers for $1, 4 for $5 strawberries....fantastic.   I love the selection of organic brands they have as well, many of which are usually on some good sales. I also love that you're able to scoop your own rices, beans, trail mixes, candy, etc. Along with the spices. They also have a huge stock of organic cosmetic/hygiene products.   Like Trader Joe's though, you're not guaranteed to find everything you need/want here. We usually do two lists, the Sprouts list, and the Safeway list - for eggs, the occasional Ben & Jerry's, string cheese, deli meats, etc.

Mmm..I LOVE me some In-N-Out! Yes, the menu is small, but the burgers are huge and the prices are a steal. I can walk out with a double-double cheeseburger, animal, protein style (don't judge, I'm pregnant!) for less than $3.50...and I won't even finish it.   I'm stoked they changed their 'cash only' policy...as that was always a pain in the ass. They also use fresh ingredients, never frozen beef, and they cut their own fries.   I don't eat fast food, and I would highly disagree that In-N-Out be classified as typical "fast food". Do you see Burger King or McD's using only the freshest ingredients and cooking everything to order?

I don't shop at Banana Republic. I never have, and I probably never will. HOWEVER, I did decide to purchase my bridesmaids gowns from Banana Republic and I have to say I have never experienced better retail customer service.   To make a very, very long story short:   The dresses I wanted were almost impossible to find. I ended up purchasing two from two separate locations and having one shipped from California. The associate at this store, Vicki, personally called and had it shipped for me. She was extremely patient and very helpful. I was absolutely shocked (and gracious!) at the outstanding customer service I received at this store.   Thank you!!!

My new hubby and I had the pleasure of working with Bruce for our recent wedding. We held our wedding in the backyard of a family member's home, and had about 150 guests attend.   We decided to do only heavy h'or deurves, so Bruce came up with a menu that consisted of shrimp pesto pizzas, spanakopita, amazing grilled vegetables, a delicious spinach dip, assorted fruits and cheeses, and a carving station with the most delicious roast beef and rolls. The food was beautifully displayed and all of it tasted fantastic. We also had two open bars in separate areas of the yard and, of course, they were a big hit.   His staff was extremely professional and attentive. Not once did an empty plate sit too long on a table, or a serving tray remain empty.   I have to recommend Bruce and his team to anybody looking for spectacular catering. Bruce will work with you and get you exactly what you want, and assure you he will take care of everything. Not to worry, Bruce lived up to and exceeded his standards. It truly shows that he takes great pride in his excellent service. We couldn't have been happier.

I had never had boba tea up until a month or so ago, when a coworker brought me a cup one night for work. I'll admit, I was skeptic at first, and rather nervous. The thought of those little black tapioca balls floating around in my tea made me cringe. However, after judging the tea on the cute little cup and fun extra wide straw, I decided I would give it a try.   I drank most of the tea first, which is delish! Not too sweet and not too milky. I was still scared of possibly sucking up a ball by surprise, so I was extra careful not to. Finally though (through much annoyance of my friend), I slowly sucked up a boba ( I say slowly as to not choke on it, hilariously, there is a warning for this on the cup).  They are very chewy and a little slimy, so the texture threw me off at first, but eventually I got over it. And once I got over it, let me tell you, that boba was doomed.   I've made the 30 mile or so drive a couple of times to get this stuff, it's so good. I really wished there was one closer to my house! (Although I think they sell them at the Cultural Center - I'll have to check it out).

Oh summer of 2007, what would you have been without Z Pizza? I don't eat here nearly as much as I used to, but during those warm spring months there was nothing I wanted more than a late night bike ride with my bestest for a couple of slices.   It's a little pricey for pizza, but when you order it fresh, it's worth it. The daily slice specials are awesome, but if you don't get it straight out of the oven it can be slightly disappointing. I recommend any of the specialty pizzas (my favorite is the classic American) or the calzones.  This place just has a fun, laid back atmosphere. I love that it's downtown and just a short, smooth ride away....

Eba cafe is amazing. The boba tea here is some of the best I've had, and it's so reasonably priced. I also love that they take cards! It seems every other little asian tea house takes cash only, and who the hell carries cash on them? They have a large menu of food, as well as tons of different drink options. They also sell gelato, lots of little random knickknack items, and Eba clothing. Oh - another great plus, they have punch cards! The perfect way to reward all of us boba addicts.   Anyhow, this place is great. It's laid back, they have better hours (then that "other" boba place ;) ), and the owner (?) is super friendly. Not to mention it's even CLOSER to my place than that "other" boba place. Yay!  *If you are unaware of the "other" boba place, feel free to check out my Lollicup review(s). Support Eba!!!

I'm more of a cakey, gooey, crispy brownie-type girl. Fairytale Brownies are dense, grainy, and fudge-like. The flavors aren't spectacular, but more artificial tasting. Also, I don't like how each is individually wrapped and frozen then defrosted before selling. If I'm paying over $3 for a brownie, I expect it to be fresh.

I absolutely love this store. MAC has such an amazing line of cosmetics, so many colors, so many different types of makeup.   This location is by far my favorite. The Scottsdale locations (Fashion Square) are a little too in your face and crowded, unlike this one. The staff here are very knowledgeable and so helpful. And I love how they keep your product on file - just incase you forget that beautiful shadow you used every last bit of.

Alex, the owner, started cutting my hair two or so years ago. She is absolutely brilliant. She's given me the best haircuts/styles I have ever had..the compliments are endless. She's amazing when it comes to listening to your ideas and working with you on them. I have never been disappointed with any of her work..I've referred several friends and I'm sure they would say the same. She just opened up her new place (a.bloom) and it's great. Check it out, I SWEAR you will love her and her work!

I absolutely love Mamma Mia's. The pizza here is awesome and the service is always friendly and speedy. We usually get several different slices to go and a salad for under ten bucks! This evening I went alone, and the guys let me exit through the back of the store so I didn't have to walk around to the back of the creepy dark building by myself (the parking lot is behind the building). How nice!

I hate this location. So much. So so so much. Every single time I have come here (it's been more than a few, trust me), they manage to royally screw up my order. It's not that hard people, you slice the bagel, you toast it, you give me my cream cheese on the side. I don't know how many times they give me the wrong cream cheese, don't toast the bagel, or put the cream cheese on it. Wrong! Wrong wrong wrong!   Also, the employees here are either ignoring you or are clueless. As well as slightly unpleasant. Oh! And it's dirty - check out their "espresso bar".

Let me share some of the amazing deals I've scored at Hissyfits (and if you know anything about children's merch, you know these are total steals):  - an awesome pink Rody horse: $20  - a like-new MacLaren bouncer: $25  - some sweet like-new neon green Adidas kicks: $12  - a like new Bilibo: $12  - countless nearly new Gap, crewcuts, etc clothing items: less than $10 a piece (usually less than $7)  - awesome toys: usually in the $5-10 range  - the coolest wayfarer-style shades for my 2 year old: less than $10  ....AND my HF punch card is full, giving me a 20% discount on my next total purchase. Um, amazing much?   They also update their FB page constantly with newly acquired merchandise, usually their bigger ticket items: strollers, furniture, bigger toys, etc. I don't know how many things I've purchased over the phone because they do this (genius!). Also, if you're in the market for something specific: ie a double jogger, you can request to be put on their Wish List, and they'll call you when they receive one.   To the people complaining it's crowded and smells (really, smells? Have you ever been to the Wal-Mart at Christown?): you're discount shopping for Christ's sake! It doesn't smell and crowded means they're doing well and they have more goods for you to purchase. Explain to me again why you're complaining.   I hear they're expanding soon, too... the bargain shopper in me is giddier than ever. Hissyfits is, in my book, hands down the best children's consignment store out there. They consign what people want, not just whatever is brought in...which gives it a huge advantage over surrounding consignment stores: you don't have to filter through tons and tons of junk to find the awesome stuff.

Eeeehhhhhh.....I really hesitated writing this review, because I think HIssyfits was (is) really great. It's just the last few times (over the last 6 months or so) I've been in, I haven't found a single item I'd buy for either of my daughters. I've also brought clothing here on several occasions to consign, usually new or very gently used big-box brands, and they deny most of it. I don't take it personally; mostly I just wonder why a brand new summer outfit from Target / BabyGap / Carter's wouldn't be worth selling?   Last summer I dropped a small fortune on denim shorts and rompers, dresses, and t-shirts (BabyGap, Target, Junk Food, Crewcuts, Tea, Imoga, etc) for my then two year old....and my run a couple of weeks ago, hoping to do the same (for my now three year old), left me empty handed and majorly disappointed. I feel Hissyfits' aesthetic has changed so much over the last few months that they now carry clothing I would never be interested in buying (super frilly "designer items" that are way too colorful and over the top). And whereas last summer most items I filtered through were very gently used or seemingly brand new, most of what I've seen recently looked old and clearly used. I've also noticed that the items they post on Facebook haven't been as great as they have been in the past. (Yes, I realize this is a consignment shop and merchandise is always rotating.)   I don't think it's just me, because I have several friends with great taste in children's clothing who've tried consigning recently, and HF wouldn't take more than an item or two. They have also complained of the lack of good inventory. (I've suggested just buying from each other from now on.)

Really? The Art of Soup has 4.5 out of 5 stars?   I visited here the other day for lunch with my father and husband. The place was super cute. Just a few tables that gives you the coziness that accompanies soup. The menu was a little difficult to read though, as it was scribbled in a grey-ish chalk that blended with the erase marks from previous days.   After deciphering the menu we decided that everything sounded delicious. We asked to try the Roasted Butternut Squash before ordering it, and were less than thrilled. There was absolutely no flavor to it. I love making butternut squash at home and dressing it up with spices, so I guess I expected a little more. It was bland and grainy. Pass.  The hubby decided he wasn't hungry so just my father and I ordered soup. I decided on a cup of Cannelini with Kale and my father went with a bowl of Chicken Rice. From here, let's just say the only nice thing about the meal was that it was served hot and fast - go figure, it's a soup restaurant. Both of the soups were, again, bland and absolutely flavorless. The kale was chewy and the broth left a god-awful aftertaste in my mouth. My father's soup was a little better, but still horribly bland. We had to salt and pepper it, which just made it taste like, well, salt and pepper. Both soups were served with small slices of bread and cold butter that was impossible to spread. I enjoyed the bread more than the soup, sadly.   We ate what we could quickly and asked for the check. $20 for one cup and bowl of soup, with tip included. Bummer.   I appreciate the attempt at an all organic soup cafe, but I think the soup should be more than stellar if that's all you're marketing. Sadly, I can make much better soups at home. Next time I'll pass on The Art of Soup.

Okay, so here's the deal. I bought this gorgeous sweetheart strapless, ruched, fitted, curvy dress for my wedding thinking I would be wearing it in October. Receiving this dress in February, I thought I would have plenty of time to tone up that little bit for my wedding come fall. However, come April, the hubby-to-be and I were unexpectedly given the little gift of life. Baaaackup! What about the perfect dress I found?? What if we get married in October? What if I'm huge and the dress doesn't fit?!  Obviously, changes had to be made. We moved the date closer (way closer, June), we 100% changed all of our pre-made plans to accommodate for our super-fast upcoming nuptials. The one thing I couldn't budge on was the dress.   I took the dress to Valentina's through recommendation of a friend. I wanted super last minute changes made just in case my body decided to spontaneously pop out overnight. I took the dress in 2 weeks before the big day, and picked it up 2 days before. The alterations done were absolutely perfect, and this amazing dress, that fit me like a glove when I first bought it, did once again (with the small exception of a baby bump). I couldn't have been happier with her work.   Her prices were extremely decent and affordable compared to most "exclusively" bridal tailors, and she had no problem making my last minute alterations for me (at no extra charge).

My parents were in town this weekend and my grandmother insisted we have Ronnie's for breakfast (it's near their house). The place was hoppin' for a Sunday morning at 10, and we had to wait 10 or so minutes for our table for seven.   The place is independently owned, and reminded me of Mike and Ronda's The Place, with a little more flair. Still, I felt as if I was in a hole in the wall in some small hickville.   The menu items all looked tasty (or I was just really hungry). Pretty much your average country breakfast dive fare - think steak and eggs, corned beef and hash, skillets, omelets, and pancakes. I wanted a mix of random foods and ended up with a half order of biscuits and gravy, 2 eggs, fruit, and a slice of ham. The food was decent, nothing to write home about. The gravy was served piping hot (always a plus) and was very good. The ham was a little rubbery, the eggs were average, and the fruit was some sad pineapple from a can mixed with overripe cantaloupe and a few red grapes. My mother ordered a pancake on the side of her Florentine omelet (which was good), and it was huge. We passed it around the table and still could not finish it. It was probably one of the better items I tasted, as well - light and fluffy, lots of butter, with just a little crisp on the edges, perfect with a touch of syrup.   Anyhow, the service was alright. Our server lost our ticket so she ended up putting in our large order from memory, which resulted in one missed dish and a slew of wrong sides. She was apologetic and fixed everything pronto, though.  For a casual Sunday breakfast with the fam, it wasn't too bad. Will I drive the 20 miles from my house to eat here? Not likely.

Twisted Cultures is a new self-serve yogurt bar in the North Phoenix/Anthem area. The concept is this: grab a cup, fill it with however many of the 15+ yogurt flavors you want, load it up with your choice from 50+ toppings, pay .40 an oz, and dig in.  It seems so simple, yet it is so so so good. I'm a sucker and a half for cake batter with sprinkles and gummy bears. A fellow customer once put it best, "it brings out the inner kid in you".   It really is an addiction - we've been probably 12 times in the last three weeks and I don't see the trend slowing now that the weather is starting to warm up. It also doesn't help that we live less than a mile away.  If you're in the area or driving by, definitely make a stop for some yogurt and spoil your inner kid.

We hadn't been to Twisted Cultures in probably a good year, and after our visit last week I have to say it just isn't good. Not compared to the usual places we frequent in Central Phoenix. The yogurt isn't as frozen as it should be, and comes out of the machine too soft - yuck. None of the flavors really stood out either, and they all had an "off" taste. Toppings are run of the mill.   I can see why it's popular being that it's the only yogurt place in the area. But if you're headed in to town you're better off waiting.

We've been to Zoolikins several times now to buy our diaper detergent (we cloth diaper), and I love it more each time we visit. The women working are always friendly, and will go above and beyond to answer any questions I have. Even though we're usually only popping in for a minute or two, I always enjoy it.   They have a wonderful selection of naturally-geared baby stuff; slings, cloth diapers, teething remedies, feeding solutions, clothing, toys, etc. It's a wonderful place for picking up gifts, or heading to if you have any questions about anything baby-accessory related.   It's a little far from us, and the parking can be atrocious as it's in Old Town, but it's definitely worth the stop if you're in the area.

MMMMMM tsoynamis!   Long story short, we used to drive alllll the way to Scottsdale to enjoy one of these delectable vegan soft serve concoctions.   Now, it's a cool ten minute ride from our place!   (Not good news for my ass.)  They're kind of pricey, but they're huge and should be split. Go for the almond joy or good ol' peanut butter and chocolate (extra pb!) You won't be sorry.

We attended the grand opening of Sit...Stay last night. Mostly because my toddler's new obsession is hot dogs and how could we not indulge her on National Hot Dog. Plus, we're big fans of Short Leash!  I could write a novel about our experience (a good one!), but I'll try keep it short and to the point.   Positive:  - While service was on the slower side (totally understandable, it was packed!), the servers and owner were incredibly friendly, accommodating, and so gracious. They thanked us multiple times for coming out to support them and apologized beforehand for any bumps we may experience.  - The menu! It took me a few minutes to realize they have a completely new additional menu available. While we stuck to the regular dog offerings this time, we'll be back to try some of the new items.   - The food, of course. Normally I go for the Igby, but gave the Devil Dog a try instead. It was awesome!   - They split our table's check no problem. We ordered four dogs, a kids dog, and a polkadot casserole (?) and our check was $51. Not bad. Obviously pricier than the truck, but we don't mind paying a little extra for the sides, ambiance (a/c!), full service, and bigger selection.   - Design and location. It's super cute inside. You can tell they spent a lot of work making it reflect the Short Leash brand.    Now I totally understand it was opening night and there would be a few wrinkles needing smoothing out. Here are a few of the minor bumps we experienced:   - I asked for mushrooms to be subbed in place of the red peppers on my Devil Dog, but didn't receive either. They were swamped and I didn't want to be "that" person, plus the dog was pretty killer anyway so I let it go. No biggie! Next time I'll speak up if needed.  - They forgot the chips with one of our kids dogs, but the owner had them out pronto when we asked about them. Again, nothing big! Though they were very apologetic, and we appreciated that.    - The macaroni and cheese was....different. The penne was really large and the cheese sauce was very....gummy? Processed? I'm not sure the word I'm looking for. It left a funky film on our teeth, and my daughter didn't eat more than a bite (when she normally loves homemade mac and cheese). Would love to see this improved!  - The salad vinaigrette. The green salad that comes with the dogs was really underwhelming. The dressing was light but also pretty flavorless, which made my salad taste pretty "green". Nothing wrong with that, but I think a simple green salad should have a pretty flavorful dressing paired with it.   All in all, it's been pretty awesome to witness Short Leash grow as it has over the last few years. The owners and staff have always been so great when working the trucks...they truly deserve this. Everyone was so excited to be there, and we were excited to be a part of it! We'll definitely be back soon.
