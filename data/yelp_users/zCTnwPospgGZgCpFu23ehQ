After having an accident in July I was referred to by my insurance company.  They stated they were on some type of preferred list.  Well it turns out the list means they can literally treat you worse cause your on the guaranteed money list, so they basically screw you over on all your values and get away with it.  All they wanted to do was total out my car, so they did not have to deal with it making up things like soil-age on the seats.  The seats are black and leather how could they possibly soil?  Everything simply wipes off with 409 and a rag.  My insurance company really let these guys run the show which was really sad, because not only were they screwing me over they were taking advantage of the insurance company as well.  They are blinded by the fact that they rather total out a car than fix it.  Well instead of taking it to them I decided to fix it myself.  After about 1500 dollars and some sweat equity it was back to normal.   They stated that the job would have cost over 9k to fix the car.   Just be warned, you've already read several bad reviews, and here's yet another one.  Not only will they take you and your car for a ride, they will damage your insurance company in the process.  Stay away from these guys they do not understand how business works.  Allen is the guy that is the worst stand clear when you see him coming.   Their decision is final and the insurance company simply listen and move on.  It might be time for a new insurance company.  Pretty sad after 23 years of loyal service only filing one claim with these guys now its time to shop for new insurance that does not associate with Gerber Auto Body.

I had used the J&J consignment store in the past and sold over 5k worth of furniture in about 2 weeks and a check in the mail within a few days.  Now that J&B took over I took an item in for only $300 and it sold immediately back in June. I called they said they would pay at the end of July. Now we are at the end of August and still no payment.  New management is good about selling, but not so good about paying up when the money comes.  Now you know what you can expect prior to dropping off you furniture for consignment at J&B. Very sad.
