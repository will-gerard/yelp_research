Being delayed is never pleasant but a well appointed airport could help.  Things like dining options, free wifi, charging outlets and seating areas.  All things that this airport lacks.  The boarding areas are small and run into each other.  If everything is running smoothly, it's a tight fit but one small hiccup and BAAMM!  It's survival of the fittest.  Try balancing on your "22 inch suitcase while hovering over a prized outlet while you feel the heat of staring eyes who want your tiny spot.  Geesh.    Must pack spare battery.

Hello Lo-Lo!  Oddly off the Main street but that's cool.    Our server was cute, attentive, and welcoming.  They were playing gospel music in the background.  It's all about the food baby!  It's simple down home fare and they do it well.  If you're looking for something different and you're near the airport.  Try it.

I watched an episode of Diner, Dives and Drive In's and saw and episode where they featured a pizzeria in San Antonio, TX that had an oven shipped back piece by piece and where they make their own cheese, had been trying to get out to that part of Texas for months.  I never made it to that pizzeria but Pomo deserves a spot or at least high accolades.  They have an oven that was shipped from Naples, a section on their menu that's reserved for E.U. certified ingredients.  We tried 2 different pizzas, the Principe and the Toto Sopore and wow, when it comes out of the oven it's just heaven in my mouth!  Excellent crust, light sauce and not at all greasy.  When we finished, we had to try the cannoli after hearing so much about it on yelp but found it the almond/cream filling a bit bland.  We felt like we were visiting a friend's house by eating here.  Just as we were done.  The owner sent more desserts over!  Shots of Limoncello, Panettone, and thinly fried pizza dough spindled with powered sugar.  Very nice ends to our meal. We left full and happy!
