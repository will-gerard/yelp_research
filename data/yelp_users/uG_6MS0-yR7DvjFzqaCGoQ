I have always gone here when I had my poodle, and when I moved back from Flagstaff with my cat, Claire, we have been going here ever since for veterinary care and services.  As my cat is aging, there are additional health concerns coming and this past week Dr. Wiblin spent almost a good half hour on the phone reviewing all of Claire's test results, blood work, etc. and all of my possible options.  It made us feel like "valued customers" that the actual veterinarian spent that much time and was concerned and empathetic regarding her kidney issues. I would highly recommend this facility to anyone looking for an office that cares.

Server was helpful with choosing wine and honored a coupon for us, even though we were a few hours too early to use it (truly appreciated).  We always enjoy the meat and cheese platter, although our "crusty bread bowl" for our salad, was a little less warm and too crusty than it usually is. This is an overall good hang-out place where we can spend hours enjoying wine and food, especially the interestingly shaped "Rustica" pizzas.

I just wanted to give a kudos to the 5th & Wine crew for making our Easter brunch an awesome experience.  I had visited them the night before and even though they were busy, they still managed to squeeze us in their outside seating, even if we had to share a general table area.  I knew that getting in for Easter would probably be tricky, but since our Easter had been postponed for a week due to family illness, I was looking to make quick plans.  I put our name on the reservation list and hoped for the best with the craziness of a holiday.  As in typical fashion, our group was running behind and we let them know.  Upon arrival, they remembered our having to share a table the night before and worked to get us an awesome table in the shade patio style to enjoy the outdoor weather.  We did the bottomless mimosas and bellinis and our server was attentive and never let our glass dip very far.  Overall it was an amazing experience of great personalized service and this has become one of my new favorite places to go.

Over the weekend I had been told about this great new, slightly trendy brewery called OHSO,so when my friend was looking for somewhere to go for St. Patrick's Day that would not be as crazy as the traditional Irish pubs, I suggested we try here.  The friend that referred me to OHSO did let me know that he had encountered some difficulty with their texting system for seating people, so to be aware of some technical difficulties, but that the food, beer, service, etc. made up for it. As I was a few minutes away, my friend texted me that parking was difficult, but that there was valet and that helped.  I arrived about 10 minutes after her and sat in front of the valet station (where I was almost backed into by someone in a handicap spot right next to the valet who didn't notice a car 1 foot behind his/her bumper and required me to hold my horn down to prevent a t-boning incident in the parking lot).  I sat at the valet station for ~ 5 minutes waiting to be acknowledged while I watched the valets run back and forth to help other people.  At first I thought I was being punished for honking my horn (& keep in mind that since I couldn't move my car, neither could the person trapped in the handicap spot, even though I had scooted as far forward as possible to still be by valet and try to let the car out).  Finally a valet approached my car and told me that they had closed valet service (keeping in mind it was 7:30 p.m.) and that I could go to the back and try to find something myself.   I'm glad someone finally told me, but to close so early, what??? So, I drove to the back to fight for parking, which was restricted, annoying, and now had made me late to dinner because of my wait time, etc. But, all of that aside, I decided to go in and enjoy my meal.  I wasn't sure if it would be crowded due to the holiday and there appeared to be an event (meet-up type?) outside with people in green & name tags, but my friend had already been seated and the restaurant itself did not look that crowded. I ordered a soda, a drink, and a meal.  For some reason, any type of beverage appeared to be something my server could not remember, as my soda was thrown down as an afterthought and I had to remind him about my drink, which came about mid-meal.  So much for ordering additional beverages throughout the night! I should have probably ordered a burger, but thought I would order the chicken salad sandwich to balance out my fries (it made logical calorie sense in my head, I swear).  The fries were passable, but the sandwich was probably something I could have done at home. My friends swear that I need to give this place another chance and despite our service, the valet drama, and the semi-o.k. food, I'm not sure if this will be on the top of  my list for a while until I decide to maybe return and try a burger??

We recently purchased two dozen Cupcakes for our wine night.  Both Cindy and Lindi worked with us and were excellent with communication.  The Cupcakes were ready as promised and were pretty and "pretty tasty".  We were pleased that these Cupcakes were "more economical" than we have found from other places in the past, but they were also worth every penny.  The best way I can describe it:  two dozen Cupcakes between 5 girls - only 6 Cupcakes left at the end of the tasting experience.  What does this tell you?   For full details of our experience, see below:  http://azcupcakegirls.blogspot.com/2015/10/ugly-cakes-bakery-45-out-of-5-cupcake.html

Why I'm done with Crepe Bar:  Coming here in general, I expect a wait.  A wait for tables, a wait to order, and at least an hour wait for my food.  Which should say, either how popular this place is, or how unprepared they are to handle demand.  Prior to today, I would have said the former (which is why we've waited outside for them to open before just to get faster service, etc.).  After today's experience, I am going with the latter.    I understand that a crepe is not a quick prepare meal.  And we were briefly warned that they were running "a bit behind today".  And finally, in their defense, we came in an hour before they close.  So, I shouldn't have been upset that they were out of basic items like mushrooms.  But, it was disappointing.  After waiting the standard hour for food, I did start becoming a bit antsy.  And the blood sugar started dropping as we watched table after table receive their food, including a couple that came in after us (this despite the fact that we had been assured our food was next).  So, finally, our crepes started seeping in, one to two at a time.  I had ordered a turkey with gouda and vegetables.  That's what the waiter said he had, so I took my crepe, announced to my friends that selfishly I would be eating because I did have somewhere to be afterwards and would need to take off shortly.  As I was eating, I noticed that it was actually a crepe of eggs and ham.  Nothing at all like I had ordered, but it was the order of one of the other girls.  I drew the server's attention to the mislabel and that I had already eaten 1/4 of it.  Ironically he was serving the table with a ham and egg crepe, which was her order again.  So, we received 2 of her orders, but none of my.  I told him that I was in a hurry and needed mine to go because of the EXCESSIVE wait.  And we were still missing one girl's food.    He told me that he was embarrassed and that the wait was excessive, mostly due to a lack of preparedness in the kitchen area and that they would get my meal to go. Finally, the last girl received her food, that was, SHOCKINGLY, missing some of the ingredients, especially guacamole, that it was supposed to have. Another mis-made crepe from our order, that would have to be a correction after she had was almost done with her meal.  As my To-Go crepe was arriving (which I have to give some credit for the speed that they showed crepes COULD come out, although apparently no one offered to refund anyone for slow speed, mis-orders, or general poor service, or to bring us a granola sample like we've had in the past) they were bringing little "brownie bites" that at this point, felt like a small bribe for the awful service, prolonged wait, and mis-made crepes.    I took my To-Go bag and as I was driving away, I noticed, that although all meals come with the standard salad, mine did not have this in the bag, just a crepe to go, so, once again, I was "jipped' on my meal.   And as I finish eating it while I type my complaints, it was a turkey with vegetable crepe, but without gouda, the third ingredient I asked for.  Once again, a mis-done crepe from a HORRIBLE experience.  Let's hope Crepe Bar remembers what made them this popular (from food truck to restaurant) and can channel this again.  But, I , for one, will be finding my crepes in a less stressful, more efficient environment (and one that actually makes the food I paid for).

I was very impressed not only by the selection, but also the speed, and taste of the salad and pizza options here.  I visited this place twice within a week, once for salad, and the next time for pizza and both times I was very happy with my selections.  The pizza wait time was so quick!  They even have wine here, which makes everything better.  I like the build your own options and I appreciated the customer service and quality control.   Highly recommend this restaurant.  I will definitely be returning because there are a lot of pizzas I still need to try!

When my friend suggested meeting at this hidden gem in Chandler I wasn't sure what to expect.  Fortunately I had gotten lost earlier in the week looking for Gangplank and found The Perch in my circling of the neighborhood, so that spared me the drama of finding it and knowing where to park when we went there.  My friend had managed to arrive early and secure a table, which probably helped with the experience of being able to walk in and be seated.   I loved the environment and the birds and the wine, and my food.  And it would have been an "awesome" experience had our service been up to par (and also, had the next party not felt that their night out should take over our space both physically and verbally, crowding in on my friend & I for most of the evening).  Our server started out with high expectations - he was attentive, took our drink and food orders, and the food came out in a timely manner.  Then, it just felt like he "disappeared", barely checking on us afterwards, etc.  Finally I was able to place an order for Coca Cola (my favorite beverage aside from wine) & this is where it all went awry.  When the Coke came, I tried drinking it, but alas, it was Diet Coke.  I am a straight up, regular Coke drinker who hates the aftertaste of diet soda.  I tried taking a few polite sips, but just couldn't do it.  I had to finally flag the server down to ask for a replacement, upon which he became very defensive, as if I was accusing him of messing up everything and wanted to blame someone else for my soda issues.  He did not return for a while, so I asked the busboy if he could bring me a regular Coke.  Finally, both of them returned to inform me that someone had switched the lines for the diet and regular Coca Cola and if I wanted to wait, they could try to get me a regular soda.  As I sat waiting and chatting with my friend, the server returned to ask if I really wanted to actually wait for the soda, which felt a bit rude, as if he didn't really want to help me.  Now I was stuck with bad soda aftertaste and nothing to wash it down with.  Finally, after waiting almost 10 minutes, both of them returned with a new "replacement Coke", which still tasted of diet in both glasses, so I asked to have all removed and not put on my bill.  From this point forward, the server (beyond asking if he could drop off the bill and split the check), no longer spoke to us.  He dropped off the bill, took our cards, returned the cards, and took the signed copies without a word.  Not a "thank you for coming", "sorry about the Coke", NOTHING.  As if he no longer wanted to have anything to do with us.  Even the busboy apologized to me on our way out for the mix-up.  He almost felt like a more attentive server than the one we had, although it made me sad because the original server had started out so well.  All of that aside, I'd like to have more time to explore this place and see if the service (& soda lines) improve upon repeat??

When my friend recommended Prowess Pole Fitness I was looking for a challenge.  Something to force me a little out of my comfort zone.  And that's exactly what I found. At first it can seem intimidating with all of these people doing these AMAZING things on the pole, on the lyra hoop, with the ribbons (even just on the ground flexibility!).   But it is also inspiring because now I know what I want to shoot for, and even if each week I can see my skills grow a little more towards my goal, mission accomplished.  What I really appreciate is that they recognize that the average person walking in off the street is probably not going to have all of the strength and flexibility to do the tricks right away, and that is why stretching and strength training/conditioning is included with each class. Flexibility and strengthening/conditioning are also offered as other classes to help grow your pole skills, and I definitely need to get into these classes more often . .  Everyone is super encouraging and enthusiastic, and despite the fact that sometimes you are trying things that can seem scary with a fear of falling, I always feels very safe and know that I am extremely well spotted by the teachers.    I wish my schedule was not as crazy so that I could attend more often because although I am complaining the whole time, I feel much better and stronger when I am done with each class.    Each week is a new challenge of skills and I feel that this is a place where I could never truly learn everything there is to learn so I will definitely have to keep coming back.

I would recommend Jenae to anyone - she works with your schedule and is very accomodating.  The facial room is beautiful and relaxing and she takes the time to get to know her clients and their needs/requests.   The building is easy to find, and if you have trouble finding the suite, look for the grouping of suites and it is inside next to the massage rooms.  I've been with Jenae for over a year now setting up monthly facials and will continue to do so!
