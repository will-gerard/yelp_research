Currently umom shelters 146 families that are out of work and in need of help. The Shelter is made up of some old hotels.  Read to me is a weekly program hosted here that helps improve literacy for the children  that stay in the shelters.  If you are looking to do something good for the community this is a rewarding experience.

I've been here a few times. Very cute atmosphere. I definitely recommend it. I came with a very big group today, everyone around me loved their food. I had to send the soup back because if was luke-warm. However, they were very quick to make up for the mishap, and the service was excellent. My friends were all thrilled with their meals. The tortillas before the meal are excellent as well.

Anna's is closing!! So, if you are in the market for some bedding or drapery I suggest you go now because the entire store is on sale. Overall, I like Anna's. I do wish they had a larger selection. The staff could stand to be a bit more friendly. Sad to hear they are going out of business.

My experience here was easy breezy. I had to send a fed ex envelope and the representative was able to help me immediately. He gave me my receipt and showed me my tracking number and I was all set. I'd say I was in and out of there in 5 minutes.

The best hidden gem in Phoenix.  This little italian retaurant is one of my favorite places to dine when there is a special occassion. The location is fairly inconspicuous. I only found out about it because of a deal online that they had.   Why its so great: The retaurant is small and quaint. Perfect for a romantic date. I also brought family here as well. The service has been absolutely wonderful every time I've gone. The very best part by far is the dinner I get there every time I go. I usually like to change things up but I get the same dinner here every time.  This restaurant offers the best dinner I've had in all of my 7 years I've lived in Phoenix - and this is no joke.   Best tasting dinner ever: The Cannelloni. The combination of crepes, veal, and sauce are melt in your mouth delicious. I always leave completely satisfied and always look forward to coming back.

I kind of hate quick trip - only because my boyfriend loves it so darn much. He drags me there regularly.  No normal human being should ever need to go to the gas station as often as he does. That being said,  this gas station does not deserve a bad rating because my boyfriend is obsessed with them.  Truthfully, it is a nice gas station.  It's clean.  The service is always quick,  and the gas prices are usually reasonable compared to the competition.

Well, our server started out with a strong introduction, but ended up being awful by the time the appetizers came. I honestly think that she might have been on something. I'm typically more forgiving of servers since I used to be a waitress myself and understand how chaotic a busy evening can be. We asked for things 3-4 times (bread, drink refills), she'd walk away then come back to the table empty handed. She had a lot of personality, but..It was really odd. The 4 stars is for the food. It was fantastic. Luckily, the kitchen staff was most definitely sober that night. The ribs were incredible, and the prime rib was cooked perfectly. Kudos to the kitchen.

What a nice experience!  This office offers free WiFi for your short wait time.  I went for a routine skin check and had the pleasure of meeting dermatologist Dr S. Sasha Jazayeri. He was wonderful.  Very friendly,  easy to talk to,  and addressed all my questions. Doctors with great bedside manner are hard to find. I wish I could find more doctors like him. Based on my experience,  I highly recommend this place.

This is a pretty organized airport. I never seem to have difficulty finding my terminal. Once you understand the general layout of the airport its easy to get around. They have cell phone lots that announce when an airplane has landed which makes it so much easier when you are waiting to pick someone up.

Really like Dr. Greigo. She is personable, and I feel like she cared about me as an individual.  This is my 2nd visit to her, and both times I've walked away from my appointment better educated about my dry eye issues. I recommend her.

Went here to celebrate my big 3-0. Our server I think was named Michelle.  She was excellent. I went big.  I got the Bahama mama (my fav! ) as always it tasted delicious.  No other restaurant makes them as tasty. For dinner I ordered the ultimate feast. The food was beyond delicious.  The timing of the orders was perfect.  All in all it was one of the best meals I've had in the last year.

This is my favorite Walmart in the Valley.   They have always been pretty speedy in checking me out. I absolutely hate waiting in line. I'm elated about the new self checkout lines they just installed.   The store is clean, and always well stocked. Partking is pretty reasonable too. A great place to pick up something quick, or putz around for an hour.

I'm a repeat customer, and they are my go-to place for car maintenance. Every experience I've had has been fantastic. They are personable (I usually speak with Alex or Chandler), helpful, and just decent honest people. I never feel pressured to do unnecessary maintenance like some auto shops. If you live or work locally the offer complimentary pick up/drop offs while your car is being worked on.

Love it! Don't let the little shopping plaza its hidden in fool you. Once you enter the door you'll immediately be welcomed into a lovely restaurant with a great atmosphere, friendly staff and wonderful food. Almost everyone at our table ordered the poco pollo. I substituted beef instead of chicken. Incredible. The group I was with have quite a few picky eaters, and no one had a complaint.

I was lucky to find decent parking during the holiday season.  The mall was quite busy as expected.  As soon as I walked into the mall I was greeted with a map to help me find footlocker which I was grateful to see.  I'm not a regular at this mall and don't know my way around. I noticed the food court had an Orange Julius and a Chipotle which I thought was nice.  I stopped in at Brookstone and found out that it's a temporary location they only set up during the holiday season. It looked as though they had been raided.  Very low inventory. Overall it was a fairly standard mall.

I really enjoyed my meal at Cheesecake factory. I suggest getting the chicken littles. They are tasty. 3 of us ordered them, and we all were very happy with our meal. We also ordered the fried cheese. It was smaller than we had expected. The server was very friendly and attentive. The bread was burned, but she quickly exchanged it out for us. I'll definitely be back.

Southwest will always be my number one airline. They are not perfect, and I've definitely had a couple frustrations as I fly often, but overall the majority of my experiences are great. I love that they have the rapid rewards visa card. I love that they have a low fare calendar online. I'm ecstatic that they just started flying internationally. I'm very loyal to this airline and recommend them above all others. Southwest - I have one major ask of you. I have an android phone and I want the BING app in the worst way. Please make BING notifications for android too!

I just posted this to Southwest's facebook wall.  Their refusal to rectify this simple issue is absolutely souring my opinion of their airline.  Southwest, I have been a loyal customer of yours for over a decade, and am very upset about the customer service I am receiving from Southwest. I was thrilled to fly the new international service from Phoenix to Aruba. Since the flights don't originate out of Phoenix I bought 2 roudtrip flights to get there.   On 8/10/14 I noticed that both of my fights dropped in price. I tried to rebook my flights on the website but was getting an error message. I called customer service I spoke to a representative who re-booked the flights for me. After she made the adjustments, I received one email confirmation referencing only one of the 2 flights. I asked her about it, and she stated it was because she was on the international line. She assured me that both flights would be credited, and all I'd have to do is reference my confirmation number and fly by 6/6/15.   Well, it turns out that the credit for one of those two flights is not being recognized when I provide my confirmation number as the rep instructed. When I called customer service they said there is nothing they can do. This is literally $35.80 - not a large amount. Out of principal, however, I believe Southwest should take ownership and correct this error. As a customer, I should not be penalized for a mistake made by a Southwest representative.

This place gets a 5 star rating for the atmosphere. The food is also good, but the atmosphere is phenominal and what really makes this restaurant stand out in my opinion.   This retaurant is a bit of a drive for me, but it is one of my go-to retaurants I bring guests from out of town to so that they can get a taste of the Southwest.

Loved the pizza! If you like thin crust this is the place to stop. I haven't had pizza like this in years.  Loved it.  Ate outside. It was a nice little place to take a break and grab a bite to eat.  Pizza is sold by the slice.  Slices are very large but also very thin crust.

I just had a great experience with the Phoenix police. Officer Glidwell (badge 8684) and Officer Zintak (badge 8934) were tremendous today. My fiance's car got hit last night in a hit and run in front of my house. This morning my neighbor spotted the car in someone's garage only a few streets away.   These two officers arrived in a matter of minutes from the moment we called to report it. They set very clear expectations for us. They were polite, friendly, and efficient. They were able to obtain a confession from the suspect. I'm very very appreciative of them today.

I really enjoy this restaurant. My go-to tasty delight here is the Fundido. I get it every time. The atmosphere is nice. I've been here quite a few times, and always look forward to going back. Service is typically good. The one incident I did have was when glasses were served to us with someone else's lipstick on them. That one kind of grossed me out!

I walked in with full intentions of upgrading my internet and ended up canceling my service completely by the time I walked out.  They placed a $250 charge on my account because an unauthorized person borrowed a cable box in my name.  I knew that person and got the cable box returned to them.  They were unable to give me my money back and could only credit my account.  Screw that!  I canceled my service.  Now the check will come to me in the mail.

I usually like home depot. I feel like the prices seem high for what you get though. I usually am able to find what I'm looking for. I'd say someone offers to help me about 40% of the time I go there. Their best feature is the fact that they email you a copy of your receipt. I wish so badly more stores did this. It's a huge bonus.   I've gone to get paint in the evenings on three different occasions in the last 6 months.  They only staff one person at 8:30pm. I'm not sure if I'm just unlucky but every single time there seems to be a line and I have to wait roughly 20 minutes for help.  I wish the workers in this department would call for backup help when they get swamped. I'm upgrading my review right now because they just got downgraded a star.  I waited in line for paint for 30 minutes without being helped. I called the store after to report the issue because it bothered me so much.  The customer service lady basically blew me off and said no one can help me and that she'll tell management.  I feel like if she at least apologized I'd feel better about the experience.  They just lost my business.  Time to head to Lowes.

I'm still not sold on whether or not buying a Costco membership is really worth it for me.  The store does offer a lot of great items at reasonable prices, but are the prices really that low? I personally don't think I get my moneys worth being single. If you have a large family I think it may be different. If anything, I will break even at the end of the year.   I still enjoy going to Costco, I love the warehouse style shopping, and the samples are always delightful. I do wish that they offered self check out. I am not a crazy fan of waiting in the long lines they usually have.

I was famished when I arrived at this restaurant.  I ordered an appetizer to get food in my stomach as soon as humanly possible.  It ended up coming out after my dinner.  I wouldn't have ordered an appetizer if I had known that would happen. The waitress was prompt, friendly, and helpful.  The food was really good,  and the pricing was very reasonable.

I was thrilled to come here for my first time to celebrate a milestone in my life. The atmosphere was lovely, the servers were nice, the food was good...I was with a large party, and we ended up sitting at the table for a VERY long time after dinner waiting for our bill. We had enjoyed some drinks and had plans to continue on to another location. Sitting at the table for upwards of 20 minutes for our bill really killed the mood. If it wasn't for the wait, I would have given them a much higher rating. Given the amount we spent as a group, I expected to have better service.

Shockingly delicious. I got the rainbow roll. Mmm. I was with 2 other people. We cleaned our plates. The prices are affordable. This restaurant isn't the most beautiful place I've ever laid eyes on, its just okay looking inside and out. The food though, is fantastic. The only reason I took a star away is because one of us received our order about 5 minutes after the other two. If it wasn't for that, they would  have had a 5 star rating.

I used to live in this apartment complex in 2009, and my boyfriend does now.  The quality of the apartments have been pretty consistent. The nice thing is that the cost is reasonable. The place can look cute if you dress it up.  They are basic apartments though,  (cupboards made with particle board,  laminate counters, etc) and you should expect that given the price.   The walls are VERY thin so is better to live upstairs if you are noise sensitive.

As a first-time customer to the establishment, I was looking forward to celebrating my boyfriend's birthday by taking him to watch the UFC fight, which they were featuring on pay per view.  My boyfriend and his buddy arrived early (about an hour before I did), just so he could be sure that we would have good seats (the ONLY thing he wanted for his birthday was to see this fight).  I made sure to let the server know that we were celebrating his birthday (discreetly, I wanted him to be surprised).  We ordered a round of drinks and appetizers; shortly thereafter two more friends joined us at our table.  After finishing our appetizers and a second round of drinks, we were approached by a different female server (or hostess), who asked us if we were staying to watch the fight and if so, we would have to pay $9 each.  We were startled because we were not informed of this (none of us, even though we arrived separately), but we obliged and asked that it be added to our checks.  About 5 minutes later, another staff member approached us and asked us if  we had paid to watch the fight (we told her yes and showed her our wristbands).  5 minutes later, yet a third staff member interrupted to ask if we had paid to watch.  At this point, we were beginning to get a bit ruffled because their tone was almost accusatory and we were paying customers.  The real kicker occurred when a security guard approached the table immediately after to inform us that our table had been reserved and that unfortunately we would have to move.  We were completely taken aback (we had ordered 2 rounds of drinks at this point, 2 appetizers, and were deciding on entrees--we were essentially mid-meal).  There were no "Reserved" signs on our table when we were seated (in fact, the table the security guy moved us to had the Reserved sign posted on it).  I found it ironic that they requested us to pay for our tickets multiple times AND THEN made sure to inform us that we would have to then move.  In all fairness, the table they moved us to wasn't in a terrible spot, but the one we had initially claimed was much better for viewing purposes (no craning our necks) and it was a roomier booth for the 4 of us.  That and the fact that I was trying to make it special for my boyfriend's birthday and thus far, the customer service had been less than stellar (no issues on the food side, however, the food was fantastic!).  It was more the lack of consideration/communication that detracted from what would have been an otherwise enjoyable experience.  We changed tables; at which point the servers cleared our waters (and two of the gals' soft drinks), after which we had to request more (when, in an ideal world, they should have been replenished immediately--I never did receive my water until after we had ordered our entrees and completely finished them (maybe I should have spoken up and said something sooner, but it's merely an observation, since I had already ordered a water to accompany my rounds of beer).  Same with the silverware and napkins--the staff cleared ours and when they made us change tables, then proceeded to serve us our meals with no utensils or napkins ( my boyfriend asked the runner, "May we please have some silverware?"  and she literally grabbed one set, placed it next to him and took off before he could explain that we all needed silverware).  Our female server was very sweet and asked us multiple times if there was anything else we needed, but my point is that due to the inconvenience of changing tables, we should not have to request the basic necessities for a second time when they were already on our table the first time around--it really took away from the experience.  At the end of the night, the tab for just my boyfriend and I totaled over $100 (there were 4 in our party, and the others spent a good deal on drinks and entrees as well).  The bottom line is that although this restaurant has excellent American-style food, we did not feel that our business was appreciated here and we would rather spend our time and money elsewhere.  As a side note,  they apparently don't do anything for birthdays as most establishments do--or they forgot--because it was never acknowledged by the staff, not even a "Happy Birthday!"  :-(

This yogurt was good. It's hard to not enjoy frozen yogurt.  I had the banana flavor, of course it was delicious.  I personally prefer self serve yogurt better since you can control the servings. We went here because there was a groupon deal,  and the location was right.  I would definitely go again.

I wouldn't have pulled in if I knew that I'd be charged more than the advertised price. If you use a credit card, don't get gas here. The advertised gas pricing on the street sign is lower than what you pay at the pump if you pay with your credit card.. I was in a rush and hadn't noticed the fine print near the pump until after I started pumping. I paid 10 cents more per gallon. I was even more bothered after I left. I drove less than a mile down the street to find a gas station offering 20 cents less per gallon than what I paid. In their defense, they likely charge more for quality gas with techron - but - I won't be returning.

I was a walk in. I was greeted promply, told to expect a twenty minute wait, and only needed to wait 5 minutes.  The prices were reasonable and I'm thrilled with how the pink and white acrylic with the gel overlay came out.  Was glad I took the advice of one of the girls as this is my nails for my wedding.  I'd definitely go again.

Yogurtini I cannot thank you enough for making my engagement so special last night!!!! I met my fiance at Yogurtini 11/11/2011. Last night, in an elaborate rouse, he surprised me by dropping to his knee at the place we met. The Yogurtini staff really stepped it up to make my day special. They brought out wine glasses with Perrier water (looked line a wine bottle), and chocolate cookies with heart shapes so we could cheer the occassion. Angela - THANK YOU. The rest of the staff whose names I did not get- THANK YOU. I will always remember this special day, and always remember how Yogurtini went above and beyond for us. I will always remain a loyal client, and recommend your store to anyone looking for a sweet treat.   Speaking of - Their yogurt is fantastic. I got a little but of the "Mint to Be" flavor on the engagement day because I'm cheesy and the name seemed fitting for the moment. My favorite is usually classic peanut butter. Second to that is their new flavor fruity taffy -- soo delicious. I've been here many times, and I've never had a bad experience.

This place makes fantastic coffee - when your order is right. I go here frequently. Unfortunately my order is wrong about 1 out of every 10 times I'm here. My typical order usually just a flavored coffee and nothing terribly complicated. I'm also a bit bummed they started charging if you want a extra syrup in flavored cofee. Oh well. I guess that change is reasonable.  For those of you that like sweeter coffees: I HIGHLY recommend the Pumpkin Spice coffee flavoring that is available in the fall time. Its so good!

Today's experience was great.  If you are looking for a great Christmas flavor I've fallen in love with the sugar cookie latte. Also,  if you have not already done so I highly suggest downloading the dunkin donuts app. You'll have access to coupons there.  Right now they are doing a promo where you get a free coffee on Mondays if the Cardinals win.  Can't beat that!

Expect to wait a minimum of 15 minutes before your order is taken. The lines are always very long.  I suppose that means they are doing well.  I go here fairly often and I notice that the staff seems to turn over a lot.  Perhaps this is just typical of a fast food joint.   The food is delicious every time.  It's really really flavorful so I hope you like spice!  The food is quality and taste is always consistent and the staff is always nice.    One thing that bothers me is the inconsistency among my orders.  I usually get the kids taco meal. Sometimes they give me 2 tacos and sometimes they give me one.  Sometimes the meat is on the side sometimes not.  I honestly don't know which one is right so I never correct them.  It just seems odd to me that there is so much confusion on how to prepare one of very few menu options.

Local healthy food, with dishes based on Dr. Weil's anti inflamamtory diet. I personally have an inflammatory condition, so when I eat here I really feel like I am treating my body properly. I always get the cashew/tofu lettuce wrap appetizer. Its so tasty! (And I'm not vegan). I know others said they felt the food here was bland, I tend to disagree. I felt like the lettuce wraps had just enough flavoring. Any extra would be too much.

For being second hand, I find that many of the clothes and items can be bought at Ross or TJ Max new for the same price. Goodwill always has that strange smell in the store. I wish they knew how to get rid of that.  However, I must say, they do have regular deals (these are posted on their website online) that make going here worth it. Saturdays is 50% off all items, and Thursdays is $1 for select items (Based off of the color of the tag - usually items that have not turned over). Although it can be annoying to sift through quite a bit of useless junk, many a times I have found a gem worth buying.   If you like thrift store shopping in general, you'll be happy with this Goodwill.

Well, if you want a good workout, this is a good place for you. I like that you wear a device so you can see where your heart rate is while you are working out. I was unlucky, and my device battery kept timing out throughout my workout. It had to be replaced twice, and finally we gave up on it. Because of this, I sadly didn't get to see my post workout results like the rest of the group. If it had worked, this would have been a 5 star rating. To be honest, I think I was grateful for the couple breaks I was given to change it out because I was tiiiirrred. I felt really good after the workout, and I have to admit I was pushed harder than I would have pushed myself if I went to the gym by myself.

I had the parfait. Very big serving. I can't say I was a huge fan of the parfait, but that was my fault not theirs. I didn't realize greek yogurt is supposed to be sour. The fresh squeezed orange juice is worth paying for. I absolutely love fresh squeezed juice. Service was good, and we enjoyed ourselves.

I will not do business with them again. I bought a living social deal, and they decided to cancel the deal without notifying me. I got  a text message that my appointment had been cancelled. When I tried to re-schedule it I was unable to get through to anyone. Their website allows you to book appointments, but no matter what day I selected, it was unavailable. Not sure what the deal is with this company, I'm wondering if they are gong out of business or something because they are quite disorganized, and make it impossible to reach someone. Luckily, living social refunded me. I felt like they totally wasted my time.

This restaurant was shockingly busy for a Wednesday night. because of this, it did take us a while to get our food. the food was good, and I had a nice time. it was nice to try a new restaurant in this area. I would definitely go again. If you go I highly suggest a blueberry soda!

This was only my second experience ever with yoga. I tried hot yoga here. They made me feel comfortable as a beginner and told me it was OKAY to just sit and breathe and that my goal today is to stay in the classroom. It was a unique experience. I can't say that I'm crazy enough to make hot yoga a regular thing for myself, but if you are interested in trying it this is a good place to try it out.  I really appreciate the way they close out the class. They pass out small wet cooled towels that have been dipped in a lavendar/tea tree fragrance. Very nice touch!

I got the curry coconut soup. It was different, but good. Worth trying if you are interested in trying a more exotic soup flavor.  We tried the appetizer trio with the roasted bell pepper hummus, cilantro jalapeno hummus, and the plain hummus. They pita chips are seasoned and flavorful on their own. The combination of the pita chips + any one of the hummus flavors is really fantastic.   The service was alright, a bit slow. Granted, I came with a large party.

Really nice to find a bar with people country dancing in old town. I went on a Wednesday night and it was surprisingly busy. They played country music 95% of the time, and they had entertaining dancing contests that kept me entertained. My friends all had a nice time.

So far so good with uber! Every experience has been convenient and awesome.  The one thing that can be very inconvenient is if you do not have cash on hand and need a ride you cannot tip on the app. I really hope to see uber do something about this.  Other than that,  I love the service. Every driver I've had had been great.  I love that you can see where they are on the app add they are driving to you.

I got dysport done here.  The lady who did it was very careful/cautious. I could tell she took her time, more than others I've done it with. She was thoughtful and thorough. This place is very cute.  Prices are great. Also, I love that they have free wifi for guests.

I very rarely rave about restaurants after eating at them. This one is an exception. I absolutely love the concept of fresh local "fast food." I felt no guilt as I tried the avacado hummus (yum!) and the sesame sweet potatos. The service was excellent, and I keep telling every health consious person I know that this is a must-try restaurant in the Valley.

This place has nice outdoor seating, and a good atmosphere. The brisket, and it was very good, although the bottom bun was a little soggy. I tried multiple samples of beers they brewed, all very nice!  A good place for friends to catch up. It was a Friday night and fairly busy, so there was a 30 minute wait and the server was slow to take our order. Additionally, I was sad that they did not offer soup like the Arcadia O.H.S.O. does. Overall, a nice place, and I'd reccommend it.

Who doesn't love chocolate? This is a small mom and pop store. The owners started their first shop in Flagstaff and now opened their second in Phoenix.  I personally loved the Gelato.  If you enjoy the taste of malt, I recommend the malt flavor since it's so unique and different.

Very frustrating experience.  They had a redkin sale for November where you buy a certain amount of products and get some free products.  They didn't honor the promotion in their advertisement because the store wasnt carrying the promotional products. Instead of offering to make it up to me by providing a different product they told me that other stores across town had the products if I wanted to go there.  Employee was nice but the experience really left a bad taste in my mouth.  I was spending a good amount of money there.  I really think they could have done more to fix the issue.

For the price, I feel like these rooms look reasonable. They have kerug coffee machines in the rooms, and the rooms seem fairly spacious. The room did have a wire that shorted out, and was annoying because the light flickered off every once in awhile. I went here to visit a friend that was staying in town. He said the staff had been quite nice and let them use their pool area after 11pm each night (the time the pool area should be closed by). The pool is lit with a blue light and looks nice in the evening. Overall, I think this is a nice hotel.

I went to a pool party here for my sister.  The cababa we were put in had a broken fan, which was really unfortunate.  The service was excellent.  The atmosphere was overall quite enjoyable.  Would definitely go again. Loved how the lobby looks too!

Frys you really need to stop the homeless people from approaching people as they unload their groceries.  Happened again today.

Very very slow service.  I'm in the self check out as I write this.. waiting on an attendant. I pressed the button to call the attendant.   At 9:20pm on a Wednesday there should be no reason to need to wait over 10 minutes.  Associate wasn't in the vicinity at all.  This is getting ridiculous.  Another customer just tried to help me out by alerting the associate that I've been waiting. The attendant responded rudely that she's with someone.  The thing is. . I've been waiting longer than the other customer.  Another 5 minutes have passed since I started this review and I'm still waiting.  Considering just walking out of the store empty handed.  If the self check out thing let me bypass the attendant notification I'd definitely not be waiting.  Tip to clients. . Don't call the attendant when in self check out.  She s here now.
