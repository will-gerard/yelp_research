After being sick for a few days, my boyfriend and I decided to order out. Using Yelp, I found Lucky Kitchen. After reading some of the reviews I decided to give it a try. The ordering process went smoothly, the gentleman on the phone was extremely helpful and told me it would be forty five minutes or less. I was a little put off by this, but less than twenty minutes later the delivery guy was at my door. I ordered the Sweet and Sour Pork and my boyfriend got the Szechwan Chicken, and both were really good. We also had the crab puffs, and I wish they had more filling, but dear lord they were good. I recommend this place.

My fiancé and I were starving. Neither of us had eaten anything all day. So when he gave me the I don't feel like cooking let's order something look after getting home one night, I knew we were in trouble due to the fact that all there was to order near us was pizza. So, I opened yelp and stumbled on this gem. Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced. My fiancé had the three enchiladas plate and I had a bean rice and cheese burrito. He ate his so fast that I know it was good, although all he could manage to say was "Spicy." My bean rice and cheese burrito was excellent. Especially when I added a little bit of their Pico. The only thing Los Burritos can work on is their delivery time. I felt that waiting forty five minutes was a little long.  I give these guys four stars.

I came in to Ultimate Consignment earlier this week and purchased two dressers for my sons. Aaron, one of the employees there, helped me pick out the perfect pair. He was so attentive and knew exactly what I was looking for. Excellent customer service from this young man.

My fiancé and I ordered delivery from this place once. Once was all it took. The woman on the phone was lacking in customer service, and seemed almost rude to me for no reason. I had to spell out the street name that I live on four times before she understood. She took my order and told me it would be about forty five minutes. An hour later she called back and hung up on me. I called back and she told me she called to verify my address, yet again, but the delivery driver "knew where it was". Twenty minutes after, I called back and asked where my delivery was. I was informed it was "on it's way", and hung up on. The delivery showed up almost an hour and a half after I placed my order. Surprisingly, the chicken was still warm, and tasted good, but the biscuits were lackluster at best, and relatively stale. I was very upset with the absolute lack of customer service and will never order from this place again.
