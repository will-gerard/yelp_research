High prices, poor selection, and awful customer service. These are the reasons I chose not to register at Babies R Us in the first place. When l received BRU products at my shower and had no use for them I tried returning to the store. I did not have a gift receipt nor a gift registry so I was told they couldn't do anything for me. I was stuck with products I didn't need. Really? Is this how you treat your customers? The cashier admitted that each item was currently on the shelves but she had no way of "matching them up" against a receipt or registry. She even suggested that I try returning them to Walmart because their return policy is very lax. I was disgusted and offended. I was doing the right thing by taking the products back to the store from which they came. Even Target allows you to return things without a receipt. I'll never buy anything at BRU.

Sheree, Matt, and everyone else at Ford/RBA are awesome! I've been signed with them since May 2006 and I've been so happy. They are professional, supportive, friendly, and uber knowledgeable.

This is my absolute favorite spot for all things beauty! I go to Matthew for my color and he's fantastic. Danielle is the best with spray tans and body waxing. She's is so professional and really puts you at ease. The ambiance is comfortable, relaxing, and everyone is so welcoming. I've recommended lots of friends to this salon and I'll continue to visit Altered Ego for years to come.

The renovations were completed a couple months ago and this is by far one of the nicest LA Fitness locations in the Valley. They've taken over empty businesses next door and expanded by at least double if not triple the size of the previous space. The locker rooms are clean as a whistle and they've even added a separate spin room so there is more space in the fitness class room without having the spin bikes in the back. All the machines are new and each cardio machine even has its own personal TV and Nike + iPod system to track your workouts. The staff is very friendly and the fitness classes are great!

I'm pregnant with my first baby so I haven't had the opportunity to consign items here but boy, do I love the shopping! Great selection on kids and maternity clothing as well as baby gear, toys, and furniture. Customer service is great and I love that they'll put you on a waiting list for specific items.

Love this place! The sandwiches are amazing and the bruschetta at dinner time is so yummy. The Nutella Mocha is my favorite drink and the staff is always super friendly. Their outdoor patio is so comfortable and I love that they're dog-friendly!

You'll never see the same show twice! These players are uber funny, talented, and goofy all at the same time. You'll be rolling on the floor laughing! The shows are family friendly so your kids will love it just as much as grandma and you don't have to worry about offensive, inappropriate, or R-rated content.   They have a snack bar with candy, soda, coffee, and popcorn. The theater seats are so comfy--and you get your very own drink holder!   Bring a group of friends for a night out and be prepared to give audience suggestions. The more involved you are the more fun you'll have!!

I absolutely love Hissyfits! I've been able to find the cutest clothes for my son (due next month). The quality is always fabulous and I love the selection.

I wish I could rate this company's service but they never showed up. My husband purchased a Daily Deal for house cleaning and we scheduled them to come a couple weeks ago at 9am. When 10:30 rolled around and no one came I called my husband who called the office without an answer. He got a call back stating that they had us in their schedule for 12pm. Great, now I have to wait around the rest of the day. Well, no one showed up at noon either. My husband called twice, left messages, and we never called back. Good thing we're able to get a refund through Daily Deal.
