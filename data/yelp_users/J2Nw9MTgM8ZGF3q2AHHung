DO NOT use the cat-housing services if you're going out of town. A Nightmare experience. I adopted a special needs cat from Scaredy Cats a few years ago and have been happy with her veterinary care here for ~3 years. I did, however have a heartbreaking experience using their cat accommodation service while overseas for 2 weeks. It was an emergency trip, so I had no time to research for the best cattery in Phoenix/Scottsdale. When I dropped off my cat, her room was filthy with fur from previous cats. She was hissing and growling from the first moment. I should have walked out right there, but she was also needing daily subcutaneous fluid injections from a fluid drip bag (perscribed by scardey cats a week earlier). I paid extra to ensure the techs would give her the daily fluids. I left food for double the time i'd be away, and her favorite toys for comfort. Upon return, my cat was skinny, filthy with dull dirty coat (had not groomed herself once), and when I got her home and unpacked her bag, her fluid drip was still there untouched (!!!!), and all the extra food was gone. None of the toys had been taken out of the bag either. She must have freaked out for the whole 2 weeks. But that was not the worst of the horror. Upon pickup, the tech said my cat's 'previous owner' happened to visit Scardey Cats while I was away. This, the woman who dropped her off because she was sick and chose not to care for her health problems.  Without my consent, they let this woman into my cat's room to sit and spend a bunch of time with her!! The very same woman that was ok with her being put down 3 years earlier. How confused is my sick kitty now?? Seriously? I am still furious. It took a while, but I've nursed my cat back to health. She's still a little thin, but getting better with lots of love and care. Do NOT use their cat sitting / housing services.

Smashed iPhone front screen? I know how you feel :/. I took mine to MacMasters on a recommendation, with a yelp coupon. $99 and 1 hour later, I walked out with a perfect Phone.  Super happy with their professional service.  They work with speed and precision, and are a very knowledgeable IT-savvy team.  You cant go wrong taking your apple products here. They have a bunch of cool accessories to check out in store too.

Used the services of Pampered Pets and Plants Jan 2013 for 3.5 weeks to take care of my cat (daily 30 min home service visit). Everything they state on their website met my expectations 100%. Price was $22 per day, and there were no extra hidden costs.  My assigned carer was Jill Freedman.  She is very experienced and made me feel very at ease at first interview (in home).  I also spoke with the Owner on the phone, and she was very professional and caring about my specific needs.  Jill left daily summary notes about my cat's health (eating, bathroom, social activity). She emailed me once or twice a week to let me know my cat was happy, and that everything as fine with the apartment. I had such peace of mind on my trip thanks to Jill.  She even emptied coffee grinds from my machine that I'd forgotten to do the day I left (got smelly after 10 days or so), and emailed me when a notice was attached to my door from the apartment rental office.  Apt was immaculate upon return with a freshly changed litter box, all trash removed, and nothing out of place.  Very professional and friendly service.   I highly recommend this team!
