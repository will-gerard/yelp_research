Prepare to wait. Every time I come here I wait at least an hour for an oil change. The car wash is usually sub par and they are usually pretty pushy with sales. Gave this place another shot today and I regret it.

the food wasn't very good, and the organ player didn't seem to know any of the songs we requested.

I was frantic when my engagement ring broke 1 week before my wedding. I had no idea what to do and who wants to get married with a broken ring? I called Fast Fix and they repaired, rhodium dipped and cleaned my ring for me in no time! The price was very reasonable and the customer service was excellent. I was so impressed and relieved! I won't go anywhere else for my jewelry now.

the wood fired pizza is excellent! I can't wait to eat here again. I also tried to grilled bread pudding for breakfast and it was excellent, the portions are large and you feel the need to eat it ALL because it is so delicious.

Awful!! Don't desk staff has no idea what they are doing. They overcharged me and couldn't help me with my insurance. I'm also pretty sure the Dr got my prescription wrong. Terrible experience.

Hot links are a must! The brisket can be a little dry but you can always cover it in delicious sauce.

My family and I go to to gecko grill all the time. They have great food with unique flavors and excellent service!

Pizza is very tasty. Crust is nice and thin and they are not stingy with toppings. I would suggest take out on the weekends though to avoid a long wait.

The ladies at Strut are wonderful. We worked with Stephanie and had an excellent experience picking our bridesmaids dresses. It s hard to choose because every dress in the store is beautiful!

I will say that the service is not the best in town! However, you really don't go there for the service. The food is wonderful and quick. I would suggest the Spicy beef fried noodles and pan fried dumplings.

I was so happy that Strut Bridal referred me here for my wedding lingerie. I was sized add soon as I got there and found I had been wearing a bra 3 cup sizes too small... Life changer. My wedding corset was really pretty and much less expensive than I expected. Very happy with my experience here, well be back for sure.

I had a wonderful experience working with Natalie and the ladies at Wedding Belles! My dress was more than I ever hope for. It came in earlier than promised and they made alterations really easy.

Lauren Bremner is a hair angel sent to me from heaven. She has remarkable skill with cut, style and color and is also very personable. I will be back!

I just got home from my makeup trial with Michelle. She did such a wonderful job. I am totally reassured that I made the right choice of salon for my wedding day!

Updated: Got married last Friday 4/4. My experience with Michelle for makeup and Becca for hair was wonderful. They were both very professional but still made the morning fun and relaxing. They are very good at what they do and I'm so happy that I chose The Edge for my wedding day!
