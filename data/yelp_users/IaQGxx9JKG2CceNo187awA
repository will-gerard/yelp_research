Although I have only eaten at Patsy Grimaldi's one time and it was good, my review is about the bartender and their overall service.  I came in to the restaurant on Saturday afternoon after spending most of the day at the Culinary Festival.  For some reason, we had a craving for pizza after eating a slice from Spinatti's at the festival.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.  When we came in to Grimaldi's, we were informed of a 20 minute wait for a table and instead decided to grab the four available seats at the bar.  We were in a good mood and definately had a few drinks during the festival and were enjoying the time with some friends.  The bartender seemed to be in a sour mood (maybe from people before us) and immediately said "I am not serving you any drinks" before we even asked for anything.  He then proceeded to accuse us of being obnoxious and loud and walked away without even asking for our order.  I found this one of the worst experiences of my entire life in a restaurant and will never step foot into Grimaldi's again.  We filed a complaint with the manager and went on our way to Malee's where they were happy to serve us food and drinks and had a much better time.  Patsy Grimaldi's should do a much better job in training their staff in courtesy and customer service.

DO NOT STAY HERE!  The pictures posted online were not close to how the hotel or rooms looked.   I will break it down:  Staff: not helpful and not friendly. They were more concerned about having you take a tour of their time shares than actually making sure you have a pleasant stay. The hotel lists online they have a "courtesy shuttle" and in reality it is just the public Las Vegas free bus that stops by.   Room: At same level or below a Motel 6. At least in a motel you get a real bed. My room was advertised as a queen bed but in fact it was a Murphy bed that folds down. Basically a pull out couch. Horribly uncomfortable. The cleaning only happened every 3rd day. I was there for 6 nites. They won't even refill the coffee bags in the room to make your own and force you to buy more. The 1 bag was good for 2 days of coffee of my 6 day staff.   Overall a terrible experience. I would never stay there and hope that no one does. AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE!  Other than all that... It was ok. Lol

This is my first ever YELP so be patient.  I was just thinking that I am sick and tired of using "starbucks" as my office away from office and I wanted to find a new place that has access to a patio or some kind of fresh air, internet, and a nice environment to work in.   Well...By George I think I found it!  Luci's is a mix of a vegan/organic market along with a coffee shop.  It has a giant garage door (think Postino) that is open today due to the nice weather and a full selection of coffee and other type quick bites and pastries.  I settled into a nice couch space by a window and am working away on the FREE WiFi sipping one of the best tasting coffee drinks in town and muching on a organic food bar.  Overall, the place feels good and is comfortable enough top come for a casual coffe and read the paper or hit the office work in a better environment.  Plenty of light to do work and also not too crowded so you can have a conversation on the phone or in person.  The only thing left to be desired is the "barista" wasn't the fastest man on the planet...but this is Phoenix and its more about quality than fast service here.

I don't frequent Chandler much but I did want to mention that I was at the grand opening of this new Sandbar and know the NEW owner of this specific location.  He told me he was revamping the current menu and that I would be very impressed.  Well...he was right!  Being a lover of Taco's but not a lover of eating a lot of carb loaded tortillas, this new Sandbar has the best option I have ever seen to be able to keep the pleasure of eating a taco with your hands and not just picking at the inside of it with a fork.  They have managed to transform the tortilla into a soft jiacama wrap.  Its delicios and goes very well with their mahi mahi or ahi taco's.  Add in some black beans and guacamole and you have the perfect light and nutritious meal.  I also recommend the pork adovado and basically every other item on the menu has been revamped and has a fresh twist on what was pretty average mexican fare...

Is there a way to have negative stars?  One of the worst companies I have worked with.  I flip homes and installed high end doors on each of them and one on my new house.  My door is a $5000 glass garage door and Paul purposely (I found out now) installed a cheap opener that blew out within a year because the door is so heavy and requires a larger opener.  Of course they won't come and fix the problem.  I wish I read the reviews before I used these guys.  I need a new opener now for $800 or more and Paul is gone from the company.  I guess it could be worse and my entire garage door could fall and break.  Seems like they did the door install correct just used a cheap opener.  Never use them.

Easy to make a appointment and really takes the time to get to know your issues and work on a solution that will get you back on your feet and not just coming back to him for more.  I trust him in and his knowledge.
