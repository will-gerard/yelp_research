I have been going to name brand for about 5 years. I find good work clothes for cheap. No more! It has consistently gone down hill. The staff there always have a "better than" attitude toward me. Maybe it's just me I don't know. And they always seem understaffed and super slow. I was in line today for 45 min, then just left. People were there waiting over an hour for trade/ buys. I would rather just donate to goodwill then to get $4 store/ $2.50 cash for a bunch of good clothes.   Tips to owner: get quicker staff who don't seem half baked and train your staff on customer service. Also there is no reason you should have to wait for trade/ buys, then go have to wait in line to get cashed out. This makes no sense.

I just walked out after waiting too long. Waited at the counter for 10 minutes to order. Multiple staff looked at me and walked by. I was in a hurry and couldn't wait 20 minutes for a smoothie. I love Jamba but get more staff people! It was at lunch time so i gave a pity star

Found shop on yelp and wanted to get a quote on 14 inch ape hanger handlebar install on my harley. Super rad shop and super nice people. The complimentary energy/ soda drink is nice. They have a good selection of helmets and other gear too. They gave me a very fair quote and a few days later I brought my bike in. They were nice enough to give me a ride home when I dropped my bike off.   I just picked it up and...man!...They did a bad ass job. My bike looks amazing...Internal wiring and all. They even ran into some trouble (parts problem) and didn't charge me for the extra labor. I'll be going here from now on for services and upgrades. I got my 30,000 mile service coming up. Thanks Head Kace.
