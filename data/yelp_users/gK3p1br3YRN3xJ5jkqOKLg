I was completely blown away by the customer service and knowledge of the ladies here at Rose Tuxedo.  I absolutely H-A-T-E clothes shopping.  I'm 6'4" and long... nothing ever fits, and I always have to try on item after item.  However after a few quick measurements, everything I was given to try on was a perfect fit.  In and out in under 30 minutes, tuxedo pants and 2 LS button-down shirts for $70.  My kind of shopping!  Cheers, ladies!!  -The voice of the Midwest  :D

My second time here.  The service is professional and stream lined, and most important when working with repair, the quotes are accurate and work is completed in the time frame promised if not before!  Highly recommended!!

In my 20 years of bar going, I have NEVER been  gouged before...... before tonight.  I'm not going to drone on and on.  Plain and simple. I had 4 beers and was charged for 6.  When it was brought up, they very gladly removed 2...  but, this was also on Monday (supposedly $5 Smirnoff martini night).   I ordered 2 Lemon Drop martinis at different times, and was charged $12 for Ketel 1 Martinis??  Ummm, either A) tell me you're going to pour Ketel, or honor your Monday night special.  Very disappointed.  I  guess be specific or get taken advantage of... shame on me for trusting.  http://blissonfourth.com/specials/

I absolutely love everything about Ali Baba... the food is amazing and the service is so personable.  The falafel is the best I have ever had, and I've worked at Greek and Lebanese restaurants.  The prices can NOT be beat for this quality of food.  Had a long talk with "Mom" when she happened to be there on one of my visits... she has so much pride in her recipes and it comes through with every bite!  Oh... save room for the baklava (made in house) and Turkish coffee!  Holy hell Batman!!
