This is a great airport. Easy to navigate and plenty of bars.

This place is where Asian fusion food goes to die a miserable lonely death of un-deliciousness.  Everything that made PF Changs a go to Chinese food spot 15 years ago has completely disappeared.  The food is sub par to say the least and I am positive the business survives on its ever aging senior regulars and young couples with coupons.    I did not make it past my appetizer when I completely gave up on this place.  The "handmade" steamed shrimp dumplings tasted soggy and frozen.  I couldn't even taste the little micro bits of shrimp in the soggy wonton wraps because the dumplings arrived coated in a cold oily black peppercorn sauce.   So.... Ummm ... Mister or miss chef ... What happens when you eat two tablespoons of whole black peppercorns in a sauce???????? I'll tell you, you can't taste anything to else for the next ten hours!!! Extraordinarily poor composition of sauce and plating.    In addition to worst food I've tasted in years, the bar service was even worse.  The bartender made it fairly clear she was "opening"'tomorrow and made cleaning and preparing the bar for the next day her priority over serving guests.  Hopefully she ll be a better server tomorrow.   If you have taste buds and care about your waistline, avoid this travesty.

I am writing this entire review about Teakwood's new horseradish pickles.  They are officially my new favorite thing in the world.  Sweet spicy delicious in one glorious bite. They need to be featured as an appetizer in my opinion.  The menu was recently revamped, lots of new tasty dishes.  And of course the nightly specials are still fresh and yummy.    Come hungry and thirsty ... This place will definitely meet your expectations!

I love love love the steamed clams.  In fact I love everything I have ever tasted here.  The bar is a perfect date spot.  Candle lit and quiet, with great appetizers and stiff drinks.  I highly recommend the Salt Cellar for its outstanding seafood and excellent customer service.

What happened?!?!? This use to be my favorite Mexican spot near campus, but apparently it's heading downhill fast.  Went in for a quick bite around 8, the restaurant was almost empty, but the three servers still seemed way to busy to be bothered with my order.  Ten minutes to take an order is ridiculous.  Once my food finally hit the table, it was another 12 mins before I found the bus boy to track down my server because my order was wrong.  The food is consistently average, but the service is just awful right now.

Love love love the Shrimp Adriatico.  I have been eating at Cafe Boa since it was a tiny little restaurant on the other side of Mill Ave. the location has changed, the menu has gotten bigger and the cocktails are far more interesting... But the food is consistently delicious! The Voodoo Penne Pasta is a must try.  Great place for a date night or just a casual glass of wine.

I dont understand a restaurant that always runs out of food before lunch time.  If you want to try a flavores croissant dont bother showing up after 10am.  The sandwiches are average.  The one upside is the service.  Staff is always friendly... Even when they are telling you they dont have any food to serve you.

First and foremost service in this restaurant is amazing.  I opted to sit at the bar and the bartender, Matt, was excellent.  He provided a really good run down of the menu and zeroed in on great recommendations given my appetite.    I chose the weekday prix fixe ... Which was a ton of food for a really good price.  For the price of any entree you get a three course meal.  The shrimp dumpling appetizer was okay, not great but tasty.  The alternative "surf n turf" with prawns and pork loin was bleeping deliciousness in my mouth.  The plate was beautiful and everything (absent the cold tomato side) had a purpose on the plate.  I would come back again and again just for that dish.    I was so full I had to grab the dessert to go... It made a spectacular breakfast ;)

This mall is a great addition to Chandler.  Way way back in the day the nearest mall was Fiesta, I can't even imagine how we survived.  Nordstorm and Macy's are the big anchors.  All the typical mall stores are present and there is a wide selection of fare in the food court.  My favorite thing is all the surrounding restaurants to grab a bite at after a long day of getting cute.  Happy shopping!

First time trying this place and it was overall pretty decent.  It is a mid-level steakhouse with typical American fare.  The bar area was very bright (to many bright lights in my opinion) and busy.    The BLT salad was terrible.  It was like that Costco mixed green salad that the cafeteria served in elementary school.  The salad showed up before the server even sat down my silverware and was completely drenched in salad dressing.  Tip: Ask for all dressing and sauces on the side.  The only thing worse that the salad was the service... One bartender was slinging drinks like a champ, the guy working with her completely left her hanging! Nevertheless, the meal continued :/   The worst thing in the world that could ever happen happened ... (Dramatic Pause) I actually had to send food back to the kitchen (glug, knife through my heart) I absolutely pride myself on not sending good back to anyone's kitchen but my medium rare steak came out with hoofs on still breathing, so rare.  The server didn't even attempt to argue, and rushed the plate back to the kitchen.  The refired steak was slightly better than the first but still not really delicious. I want to like this place ... I feel like it has potential.... So one star for the lady bartender and one for hope.

I love Arizona State University.  It is one of my favorite places on earth.  You should love it too.  Sun Devil Stadium is glorious.  They are remodeling it so that it is even more spectacular.    I can't wait until we win the PAC 12 championship.  We deserve it.    The basketball arena is also cool.  The curtain of distraction is a brilliant piece of ASU pride.    A-S-U A-S-U!

Ugh... I love Pappadeaux, but I will never understand why the service is so bad in the AZ location.  We asked to move tables and after arguing with me for a few minutes the waiter finally agreed to let us switch to a more suitable table (one with slightly less flies) ... He promptly stood back and watched me carry all of our drinks and plates to the next table.  Another server was kind enough to come from his section to help my grandmother from her seat.  Food is typically delicious, but the continued poor service leaves an awful taste in my mouth.

The crossiants are my favorite!! This is a great little neighborhood spot my fam has been frequenting for years.  They are amazing at accommodating special occasions.  I threw my dad's 68th birthday here and everything was perfect ... And surprisingly affordable! I highly recommend the pork chops and prime rib.  Great place for a cute date night or romantic dinner.

Awesome food, excellent service, and the open kitchen makes for an informative dining experience.... But make sure to make reservations!

This place is popular, be prepared for a wait at dinner time.  I snagged a seat in the bar area.  If the wait is too long for you, try to grab a table in the bar area, they serve the full menu.  The clams were so delicious... I could have picked up the bowl and drank the broth... Yum! I was super disappointed that the restaurant did not have a lot of low calorie or gluten free options.  They don't even have a salad section on the menu.    I ordered the chicken with lemon, artichoke and capers with out the breading.  Of course it came out with breading.  The cutlet was chewy and lacked flavor.... Actually i'm not sure about the flavor considering the sauce was overwhelmed by the watery marinara sauce that came on my side dish of spaghetti.  Overall the meal was disappointing.  So bummed!   One star for great service, and one star for the clams!

Bartender was super rude ... Apparently the guy thought he was behind the hottest bar in vegas.  The Death by Mocha drink was nothing but super sweet chocolate milk.  Again the bartender wanted to do anything but help us.... I mean anything ... Including having a 5 min conversation with the buser about "like how cool he is." He actually sent me to the other restaurant when I asked for a coffee.  The other bar Tanzy was actually much better.  Much much better service and a more relaxed environment.  One bad apple ...

Most painless wax I have ever had! Great location and excellent service. I highly recommend this place for all types of body waxing.  My unruly brows are finally managable.  Prices are super affordable.

It's so very very rare, but this airport bar/restaurant actually has decent food and good service.  The menu is limited of course but I have never ordered anything I didn't like.   It is pricey compared to most of the other food options in the terminal. However! Did you know that all the restaurants in most US airports are all owned by the same company, it allows it to fix the market and keep all the prices high once you pass through TSA.  An absolute crime in my opinion.  This place also has a nice grab and go menu if you're in a rush.  Safe travels!!

Worst bar concept ever.  No matter what drink you order be prepared for it to come in a plastic red cup. The gimmick is wasteful and pointless.  The bar doesn't provide for recycling even though the hundreds of plastic cups it throws out everyday are marked for recycling.  This place needs to get over the "red cup" trend and get into the now.  Very disappointed in the cliche.  Thankfully there are a couple other more respectable bars just a five minute walk away.

I dont eat fish tacos.... But I ate 4 of them here.  Torilla Fish's full taco will change anyone's opinion, even your taste buds! Everything is cooked to order so the fish comes out perfectly crispy and delicious.  All of the toppings are on the side, which was almost my favorite part.  The avocado sauce was my favorite.  The customer service was absolutely perfect.  This place definitely earned the title of best fish tacos in the Phoenix area.

Blah... That is the first word that came to mind when I sat down at this place.  The record covers for the menu is completely lame and I don't quite understand the concept of letting customers write on the chairs. This is a poor, broke man's disneyland version of a touristy New Orleans wanna be juke joint.    And the food! How dare they not have bone-in chicken breast and decent hot sauce.  It should be against the law to serve fried chicken and not have crystal hot sauce!!   The service was absolutely terrible, took over 10 minutes just to get drinks.  The mimosa was just a fancy glass of orange juice.  The food took another 25 minutes, and some how managed to come out cold.  The only thing I liked about this place was the small portions.  You definitely will not over eat... Unless you order two entrees.  All of the food tasted pretty average, the chorizo and salsa appeared to be store bought.  The chicken was not very meaty and over fried.   So again ... Blah

I love Flo's! I'm so happy this restaurant has finally made its way to Tempe... So delicious.  And a really really..... REALLY good happy hour menu.  Half off all drinks and great appetizer specials.  The food is just as amazing as the other locations.  My favorite is the Mongolian Beef, but the bartender introduced me to the salt and pepper wings which might be my new obsession.  This place is brand new so expect some slight hiccups, but he final product is always is delicious!!!   I  heart Flo's!!!
