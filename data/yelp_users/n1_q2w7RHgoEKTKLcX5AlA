Professionalism. That is what makes you remember a company; that is what brings you back. In this case, that is what drove me away. I initially went in because of an issue regarding pulsing when I was braking. Having been there before for an oil change, I decided to go back again. Pulling into the parking lot I was greeted by Jesus who led me into the lobby. That was the only positive experience I had. From there I presented a coupon for a brake service that was 50% which dropped the price to $89.99.  As I sit, Jesus (the manager in white) gets a call, in which he begins to swear, describing how it is ridiculous that he has to send an employee to another location.  After some awkwardness, I am led into the garage where I am shown the various issues with my car, bad cabin filter etc.  but unlike the brakes, (which were worn) the outstanding issue was struts and wheel cylinders which they said were shot and leaking, respectively;  a safety issue. I go back into the lobby to work out the details and price. The new total to fix struts, brakes and wheel cylinders $2400. I was stunned, I tell him I don't have that much money. He says don't worry I can set you up with a credit card and payments. I decline and from there I start trying to figure what I can delay since I don't have the funds. He pushes hard for the wheel cylinders and at one point, as I am going through the list of issues I ask "What would you say is most important?" His response, "What's your definition of important? I think crash, burn and die." And again he pushes for the wheel cylinders. At that point I make a phone call outside and try to discuss funds but my wife is a stern "no." There are just no funds for something like that, likewise I tell him the same. At that point, we are getting nowhere, no negotiation on price period. So I decide to have them put the car back together and head out, before they do they make me sign the invoice next to a statement where he puts "needs a tow truck, because he believed it was that bad." For 20 minutes, I sit there as they use tactic after tactic. He brings in his mechanic Geno, who sits next to me and not talking to me directly talks across the room to Jesus at the counter about my situation in 3rd person. Jesus even offers to call my wife for me on speakerphone which was a definite no. So, after that he looks down at his paper and as he is writing says out loud "will not call wife." In a rush to put my car back, they never put my air cabin filter back with the holder which I now have to buy, and the check engine light was now on.  Disappointing. If you take anything from this, consider the inconsistency of their services and the professionalism.

Shortly after I posted this, I received a call from the director of marketing in the Arizona area to my surprise. He apologized and suggested I go back to another location where they would treat me better. "Fool me once..." so no. I did suggest a reimbursement on my filter holder which he said with a firm yes just fax the receipt and you will get a check in 30 business days......still no money. Even if I would have received the money, they might have helped with damage control but certainly not with restoring my confidence.

Having getting my tires replaced, was recommended by the staff. As a referral the price was cheaper and they did not disappoint.   Service: Was promptly greeted by my name. When they were finished they gave me a thorough rundown of the alignment specs and a printout to take.  Atmosphere: Clean and vintage car feel Alignment: Car drives smooth and straight

Went there for my birthday. I had the short ribs, while the rest of my party of 5 had sea bass, dumplings, the chicken and the salmon. They were all cooked well and delicious. The server was awesome and accommodated all our needs even when we brought our own cake. Would definitely consider going there again.

I am reviewing the dinner not the lunch. As a Hong Kong Chinese, I believe that they probably have the best Hong Kong style Chinese food in the East Valley. All this "moo goo guy pan" stuff isn't real Chinese food so if you expect that, then go to Panda Express but if you know what to order then I think you will enjoy. Yes, there ambiance/customer service sucks but if you went to HK then I think you would be holed in your hotel ordering in because they do the same thing. A better judgment call is to look at all the Asians in there, if you see that then that's probably a better indication; we don't care about anything other than the food. A stronger indication why most Asians don't go to PF Changs etc unless you have a gift card/coupon.   One word of caution, know your Chinese holidays!! If you go during the Mid Autumn festival or Chinese New Year, you will wait for like an hour just to be seated, so arrive early same applies for take-out as well.

Came in as part of a big group. I had the chicken cultlet which was juicy and breaded just right and the sushi was up to par to other places we have been at a reasonable price. Will definitely put this on the list of places to check out when we are in Scottsdale again.
