This has been the best Starbucks I have been to in the Valley. They're nice, consistent, QUICK, and have never been hesitant to do the right thing.

Not a good experience.... I stayed at the end of June for two nights while I was visiting for a job interview. The night before my interview the AC in my room was working very poorly and I woke up a midnight because of the heat. Imagine being stuck ina hotel with no AC in Phoenix! I called the front desk and they offered to move me to a room but I was already in bed and had all of my dress clothes laid out. As if I wanted to have to pick up everything a move!   They offered to cut my rate in half, let me drink the water from the mini fridge, and gave me a fan (an extremely loud one). The next morning my statement didn't reflect the rate change so I checked my credit card statement later and I was still charged the full amount.  I had to dispute the charge through Wells Fargo and even then I had to actually call the hotel finance department. Still no resolution! Not good customer service and not a good experience.

This is a prime example of a business that doesn't take responsibility for doing a poor job. They aren't detail oriented, they operate like a machine, and they damaged my car. When I spoke to a "manager" about it, they claimed it was already damaged when it came in which is a funny thing for someone to say when they just looked at my car for the first time. And then it's another to refuse to look at any security camera recordings for me to show that it wasn't the case. Life moves on and now my business goes elsewhere.  I've had issues with the overall quality of the wash at two Danny's car wash locations now and I won't be back. Be warned!

BEST wine cafe in Phoenix! No exaggeration. Their 11am-5pm happy hour everyday is unbeatable. Their wine selection is great and if you don't like something, they take it back and help try and suggest something that might be better. The Bruschetta is damn good too. Jenny is the server I always try to get because she is so damn sweet! There is no place like Postino Central.

The employees are rude and dismissive, you're happiness is not their concern. Being that they are located next to ASU and have new customers every year, it seems that they are NOT INTERESTED in maintaining customers. They will only do what they want and they don't care whether or not you walk out happy. I have been highly satisfied with the Bicycle Cellar at the Tempe Transportation Center. They are kind and they offer solutions based on what you say you need or want. Spend your money where it will be appreciated.

West 6th was the worst apartment and most expensive complex I lived in during my time as a student at ASU. The building was a bankrupt project that used to be known as Centerpoint. It was eventually completed and opened as West 6th and it has a long list of problems. Elevators are one consistent issue in this building and that's a BIG problem when you only have 3 elevators serving over 20 floors per tower and 4 levels of underground parking. There were multiple instances where the building was down to one elevator, including the day I had to move out!  The biggest disaster during the two years I lived at W6 was when a pipe broke a caused massive flood damage from the 8th floor down. This all occurred the week of my college graduation and I was displaced for 6 days. Even when I was able to move back in, the effects of the water damage only augmented the mechanical issues that this building has that never seem to be resolved.   When you go to management for answers or with an issue they simply brush it off, they never offer any good will to their residents. To them, it's not a place that you call home, it's a business and they do not care.   It's loud, full of mechanical issues, you're helpless when you're dissatisfied, and it's expensive. I highly recommend looking elsewhere.

I was so impressed with the bartender that I had here that I had to yelp about it... These bartenders are craftsmen! Delicious drinks and a very cool atmosphere. It's a very hip and relaxing spot to get a way and have a drink.
