Very affordable place to eat.  What seems to bring people here is the daily lunch specials at 5.95 and you do get a decent portion for that price along with a small complimentary bowl of egg drop soup.  Service not the best but you really can't beat the price here at all.

Not impressed with this place at all.  The prices may be great but not the food quality.  I asked for Mongolian beef to eat on site and they gave it to me in a Styrofoam container. I had a hard time eating out of it. .don't they have bowls and plates here? ??... They forgot my water too...and the beef. ..was it really beef??...hmmmm....sorry but I won't be coming back here EVER!!!!! : (

Just because bill Clinton ate at this restaurant doesn't make it any more of a hole in the wall then it already is. . Nothing special here, I've got to admit there salsa is the bomb as in real good but the food was nothing special, very bland, service was ok. .. if you're ever on the south side of town and you need a bite to eat on your way home hit this place up prices are reasonable here. .oh!  And """Bill Clinton ate here""" as everyone likes to mention . .I guess it's a great selling point for this hole in the wall restaurant. You'll see pictures of him on the wall. .yay! !!

Very affordable. I came here for breakfast and found many of their choices to be under 10.00..they also have healthy alternative dishes as well. ..kind of feels like Dennys in here but cheaper. .the quality of food was good and service was awesome. ..I'll be back. .

We ordered the lamb gyros. The service was excellent, very friendly staff and our food was made quickly,  however I can't lie we were not impressed with their food. The lamb was dry and they don't put lettuce in with the gyros sandwiches like most Greek restaurants.  The overall quality of the food was not good and I hope they can improve on this as I'd like to come back again some day.

My first time dining here and the food is exceptionally good. I'm very happy with the quality here plus you get good sized portions for a reasonable price.  I paid 8.95 for chicken curry and it was the bomb and I do mean good. ..I'll be back for sure. ..

I'm sorry this is probably a great sports bar it seems like but the service could have been better.  First we had to flag down a waitress and she didn't even provide us with menus so we got to play guessing games here.  Pitchers are now only domestic and no microbrews....if your big into sports sure you'll enjoy the hundreds of TV screens broadcasting your favorite team but I wouldn't come here for casual dining. ..

I was immediately turned off when I pulled up in the parking lot which is located behind this restaurant. .it looks like they haven't sprayed down the sidewalk since the day they opened. The Sidewalk is dirty and all black and you can smell the garbage dumpster just around the corner. .so I went inside anyways and couldn't believe how expensive their dishes are.  I settled for a LA cart bean and cheese burrito.  It was disappointing.  They didn't heat up my burrito all the way. .the beans inside were barely warm.  Food overall was mediocre.  Free chips and salsa nothing to brag about.  Service was good. I definitely won't be coming back here.  They haven't justified their high prices to me especially with the nasty appearance on the outside of this place. This is an embarrassment to Scottsdale.

Third time back here service was horrible. .waitresses never checked if everything was ok they acted like they would rather be somewhere else.  Food is horrible again the only good thing about this place is the vacation type atmosphere

You don't know burgers til you've eaten fat burgers...they are up there with in-out burgers but even better in my opinion,,, definitely upscale in fast food...

Went here reluctantly with some relatives and I don't plan on returning either.  13.99 per person all u can eat and the food is very bland. Place was packed. People running around everywhere with screaming kids.  Nothing here impressed me at all.

Service was ok but not impressed with the food. I've had better breakfast at dennys. The side of fruit had old mushy strawberries and the hash browns were way over cooked.  Nice bear theme but they need to serve fresh food this is the second time.

Well that was an interesting set up.  I walked in and sat down at around 12 noon and 2 waitresses passed me by several times never said a word to me. The bartender finally saved the day when he walked over and handed me a menu.  I don't know if he was supposed to play the role of bartender AND waiter  but he did a better job with customer service than the two waitresses did.  The food was good I'll give them that, but I'm really turned off by the over all customer service except for the bartender.

Worst customer service ever.  I went in there to buy a gps system there were so many employees there i couldn't believe not one of them asked me if i needed help. After ten minutes i had to finally ask...the sales associate seemed knowledgeable with product i was looking for so I'll give her that but the over all customer service sucks..

Just your basic burger joint set up as a 50s style diner. Prices are reasonable, service was great, food is decent.  I'll definitely come back here again.

They say this is a tough hike and that's true if you are not in shape or inexperienced at hiking. For me it wasn't hard at all because I hike a lot. Beware that there is a lot of boulder hopping and climbing involved with this trail, but it is so well worth it once you reach the top of Flat Iron... the views are spectacular to say the least.  Make sure you are in good shape if you are considering this challenging hike.

If your looking for pepperoni pizza then don't come here.mellow mushroom offers toppings that you would only dream of putting on pizzas....almost any type of topping you can think of they will likely have

Waaaay to crowded.  I was squished in between two people and had no elbow room at all and forget about using the restroom once your seated,  you'll be asking 20 people to move their chairs so you can get by. ..they tried charging us 8.50 for a coke but beer was only 6.50...RIDICULOUS! !!

Food here is great and I love the location close to all the night clubs and shopping centers. I ordered the Mediterranean tuna pita sandwich and it came with a side dish.  Not bad for under $10.00. Girl that took my order didn't seem like she wanted to be here and asking for a fork seemed like an inconvenience, but I'll still come back here because their food is the bomb and all with reasonable prices.

Almost everything about this place is perfect. .location staff service...but the music. ..every now and then they'll blast that crazy loud punk rock music which is fine in the right setting but I see nearby business people come here and students studying for exams and by the look on their faces they are annoyed with the loud music. This includes me. ...I wish they would tone it down with their selection of music to something more neutral and tolerable for most people

Great place for food and family.  This restaurant is located in the heart of West gate plaza where you get to shop and let your kids play in the kiddie fountain. ...the Greek food here is real good.  I was pleased with the over all service as well..there's even an outdoor patio with mist sprayers to keep u cool in the summer time. I'll be back for sure

Absolutely fabulous! !!! I love this place.  My first time here on taco Tuesday and free appetizers at the bar.  Frozen Margarita only 4.00 happy hour price.  Place is very clean and upscale.  I really like the service here.  They treated me well and checked up on me. ...this is a great place to enjoy happy hour with friends. Highly recommended! !!!

Not all pho restaurants are created equal and this place is no exception.  I can't complain though.  The servings are big and very filing. Atmosphere is kind of dark with black and orange painted walls but i can't rate them on the color of their walls everyone has different taste.  All in all this place is good I will be returning..oh!  And about pho soup being great for colds and hangovers. .this is so very true.
