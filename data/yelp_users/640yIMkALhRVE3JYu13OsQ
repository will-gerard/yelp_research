This was another location that was on the list of places to try while in town. I did, and enjoyed the food very much. Being from South Jersey and now living in MD there are cookie cutter Mexican and Southwest places throughout the area. So that being said even an OK Mexican Southwest joint is going to be fantastic for me. There are a few staples that make places stand out for four stars and this place had them. There are a few things in addition to the food that makes this place great.   "The Good" -  The staff is very attentive and polite. The fresh chips (which were awesome) arrived before I could crack open the menu. The Dr. Pepper stayed filled the entire meal and the food came out fast and was delicious;. I ordered a combination platter to try some different things that I like taco, tamale, etc... all were very good and delicious, the plate was packed but did not have that ..."Oh here are the sides with a few small bits of the main. It was a good balance and tasted even better. - The Salsa is also homemade, tastes great and is a great start to the meal.  "The Meh" - When you are told to lock your doors while inside ... take the advice. - In a strange out of left field observation ... not a lot of windows.  "The Bad" - Nothing really bad to comment on.

I visited this location on a tour with eight other folks and this was one of events I was looking forward too. The experience started with a young attendant behind the counter that was 95% attitude and sadly that left a bad taste in my mouth as that was my first impression of this business... The instructor was strict and knowledgeable, but you want that in someone that is teaching you what to do and how to do it and I hope he recognized the uphill climb he had to make was due to the poor customer service that met us at the door.   "The Good" - The experience was enjoyable, just marred a bit by someone that had an attitude that rubbed off on the rest of the staff. - Protective gear provided if you do not have your own or are traveling.   "The Meh" - There is a list that could go here or bad. I am all for giving a place a second chance and may... as the manager taught the rookies well and was knowledgeable as I said but came off very defensive due to the fact that I do not think they were prepared for eight people showing up at one time and did not have the space to put us.   "The Bad" - I suspect that there was a lack of communication on the manager/rangemaster side letting people know that a group of eight was showing up. I say this because it seemed like a surprise to the gentlemen that we spoke with and the person that the arrangments with was not there that day. - The initial attitude when we walked in did not go away the entire visit and took away from the whole experience. Even though the glass between the range and the showroom is bulletproof you can still see people getting pissed off and glaring though at you. Also, the "What?" when you went to the counter was not that inviting either... how about a "Hello can I help you?" or a "What can I help you with"  - There was a point when an older staff member went to the lane on the far right and fired off a succession of shots in a row to test the younger manager to see if he would do anything. When the younger guy came rushing in from the retail space thinking that one of the folks in our group was being a jerk the older staff member was in the corner timing him... Since we all figured out what the older staff member was doing it made our interactions with everyone else even more tense. - With everything from above customer service is still just that.... sadly, this place lacks it.

I would just like to thank Jennifer from the Hotel for telling me about Arizona's take on Chicago style deep dish... This place was very good and I left full and thinking I should not have this pizza memory when it is so hot out... ;) It's 32 degrees in Chicago not a balmy 78.... Ehhh Whatever the pizza still rocked.   "The Good" - The staff... our waiter played to the table and was able to feel comfortable and crack a few jokes and recommend a few beers... all of which were great calls. The best was when the meat laden pizza arrived and was introduced as the veggie pizza... our side of the table immediately object and told him it was the guys at the other end but when it landed on the table it was a beautiful sight :). - Great beers on draft including a few local favorites that escape me at the moment... ask the wait staff, they know which ones move. -Service was great for a busy Saturday night speed-wise as well. We were not waiting that long and the pizza arrived in two beers time. - The pizza... Its really good. The kind of good that as I am writing this my mouth is watering remembering how delicious it was. I'm a fan...   "The Meh" - Nothing really meh to comment on...   "The Bad" - The fact I did not get a chance to try the Italian Beef ... but man did that look good as well.

This was the second stop for the Carolinas this week and was in the middle of a circle that was filled with Hotels and restaurants near Concord Mills Mall.   I just realized that I never mentioned the internet connectivity on any of the Hampton Inn reviews. Well, unless something bad happens, let just agree that the fancy code they give you on your key cover works just fine and there were no problems.   "The Good" - The staff was great, very helpful aside from the screen starer mentioned below, I am not sure she knows that anyone even checked in that day. - The gentlemen that checked me in offered me a water... this little thing is one of the reasons they are at four stars. Its the little things that people remember and they need to know that something as little as that is working... so nice job management. - Decent location to a variety of spots to eat, including chains and non chains. Sadly, a lot of driving did not allow any food explorations this go around. - The room was clean and it was a new set up where you could see the TV from all sitting areas in the room, including the desk. - This room also had a fridge, which was nice.   "The Meh" - I do not know if it was the location, or operating procedure, but sometimes when you call to make a reservation you speak to the person, other times, they put you through to the 1-800 line and you make your reservation that way. I was transferred to the 1-800 line when I called and wondered how busy they were. When I was checking in it was kinda dead with about 10 cars in the parking lot. When I approached the desk the first person to make eye contact is usually the one that is going to help you. The gentlemen behind the counter broke first and said good afternoon. so to the right side of the desk I went... The young lady at the desk was involved looking at a computer screen. As I was checking in the phone rang and without blinking she answered the phone and greeted the customer then immediately transferred them to the 1-800 line... there must have been some really important stuff on that screen.   "The Bad" - There was no paper in the morning. Yes, I actually read the thing too, I am not just finding random things to file here. It's nice to take a few minutes some time throughout the day and just relax for a few.

I have my own opinions about our friends at US Airways especially since I used one of their main hubs in Philadelphia for a few years and have some memories. But, with all that as your history lesson for the morning... here are my thoughts on the flight that left BWI and arrived in Phoenix TWO HOURS early. Now rather than be "that guy" like the dude that was on his cell complaining that he arrived early and would have to reschedule his rental car etc... I give you the following:   "The Good" - Arrived safe and sound. - TWO HOURS EARLY ARRIVAL... I do not know how it happened, I do not even want to know how it happened. But, I know it did. Thank you El Nino and La Nina for providing the winds to allow the plane to move a little bit faster. - The flight attendants were polite and very attentive and also used common sense when they had the opportunity to wake me up when I was trying to grab some shut eye.   "The Meh" - Just curious why there are no smoking lights on planes anymore... No where else to start the discussion so I figured here would be a good place.   "The Bad" - The $25.00 additional bag fee. - The fact that there the seats are not comfortable and they are looking for as many sardine impersonators they can fit into the plane. - Zone boarding.... Why in God's name do the people that sit in the front board first and then the folks that are in the back need to wait until the goofballs clear the aisle?!? People and companies paid a lot of money for some consulting company to tell them that this is efficient... well a few things here. 1. It is not. and 2. Really?!?!

A layover in Charlotte means that I occasionally get thirsty. Especially when I fly with US Airways. This called for a beer, not a five course meal or a snack that would be hit or miss, I did not want to take a chance. All I wanted was a beer. Nothing more, nothing less...   "The Good" - The staff was polite, both the server and the bartender were in great moods and it passed along to the travelers. - The beer arrived very fast and was cold... All was well with the world. :)   "The Meh" - Nothing meh to comment on.   "The Bad" - Nothing bad to comment on either.

This was a destination for lunch that turned into another visit before we left for a few beers and relaxing after a very long day... Lunch was cool, the place was fairly crowded with a good mix of young old and families. The second visit was on karaoke night. Although the staff was polite, there are people who protect their Karaoke very seriously even by a table full of people that are just looking for a beer.   "The Good" - The girls are cute dressed in Kilts and smile on occasion.  - The service was good. The sodas for lunch and the beers for the hang out night arrived at the table fast and we were checked on so we never needed anything... Pretty cool. - Lunch was decent. The kitchen was not slammed and the food arrived fast and just as we ordered it. There were just a few appetizers that were split around the table and arrived with no delay. - (By Default an observation on the Karaoke crowd) There were some great singers and some folks that were having a blast. The guy running it had some pipes and I even heard a guy sing "on a Boat" ... I had a blast. - TVs are everywhere. - Decent selection of Draft Beer. -Advertisements for UFC showings for the PPVs.   "The Meh" - There was nothing really meh to comment on.   "The Bad" - The outside area turned into the smoking area. Sadly, if you do not smoke you cannot enjoy the fresh air... irony people. - (By Default an observation on the Karaoke crowd)  There were some evil eyebrows from the local crew when someone sang Johnny Cash, and they were not from AZ. Still had a blast though ; )

I visited the Battlefoam Corporate Headquarters while I was in AZ for a convention and had a blast. The building is in an industrial park and holds their retail store as well as about six tables that you can game on if you bring your miniatures.   "The Good" - The staff. Kyle was manning the register the night we were at the store and he is a great guy that can hold a conversation down with pretty much anyone. Also, Romeo was there and it falls back to the old grade school attitude of you give people you respect a hard time because you feel like you already know them. There were other folks running in and out making last minute arrangements on tables and product for the next day and each one gave a smile or a "Hey" as they walked past. - The selection of product is great. Not only do they obviously have the full selection of Battlefoam, there is a large selection of 40K and WFB. The latest kick is Infinity and the full range is stocked. - The scenery used on the tables is top notch and you can tell made with the intention of being played on...  - Display cases filled with beautifully painted miniatures. - Gaming area is well lit. - There are stools for you to rest on when you wait for your opponent to make their moves.   "The Meh" - Once people get over the fact it is in an industrial park you will settle in. Since this is a fairly new trend and one that is growing... it will be more commonplace.   "The Bad" - The fact I live in MD and this place is in AZ...
