This review is for their croissants! I LOVE THE WAY THEY TASTE!!!  The food is just OK nothing special.  Another great thing about this place is their free desert that they give you at the end of your meal!

I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!! We had gone for our wedding anniversary, and I had booked the room through one of those travel websites, and if you do that regularly you now that your room is going to be just a room nothing special.  So as we are checking in to the hotel, the front desk clerk informs us that our room isn't ready, and that we had been upgraded to casita. I knew from our last stay here those rooms aren't cheap, but when he said that I was jumping for joy inside!  The room was sooooo wonderful we didn't want to leave the next day!

What a great place! They even upgraded us to a two bedroom!  The place just felt like home!  Free dinner and free breakfast!  We only stayed one night, but I wish we stayed longer!  In the morning I used the gym they had on the premise, it was a little small, but that's what you expect from places like this.  Either way if The opportunity ever presents itself I would love to stay here again!

I wasn't to keen on this place as soon as we pulled up.  There was construction in the main court yard.  There was a smell of pesticide in the air, and it didn't go away for a long time.  As the night progressed we had a pleasant time.    When it came time to head back to our hotel room, the night started out ok, but by 2am I heard christmas music. I thought it was the neighbors room, but by 5am it was still blasting.   Woke up to find that the court yard below us had their speakers blasting.  So I called the hotels from desk and they within 5 minutes the music was off.  Long story short, the hotel ended up taking care of our resort fee.  So financially we made out like bandits, but still I didn't get a good night sleep.

I LOVE THIS RESORT!  They are so friendly and are always willing to help you at any chance they get!  The best thing to do here is is the spend the day ENTIRE day at their pools!  Try and get a Cabana if you can its worth it, food is included.    Rooms are clean and neat, and the view from the lobby is wonderful!  if you are ever there on a weekend try afternoon tea. The sandwiches are to delicious!

We had the best Tika Masala Chicken last night! I'm still in heaven.  My mouth was doing some kind of dance that I had to continually eat for about 20 min. non stop. And those who know me know I love to talk and eat, but this time around it was all about eating and nothing else.  I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for good Indian food =)

I hadn't been here in a few years, but I LOVE that they re did the place it looks more like an upscale boutique than the local thrift store.  I had brought my mother and sister who live in California here to show them what Arizona has to offer.  We all came away with good deals.  I got shoes and a name brand blazer for under 40 bucks.  What a steal!  We were surprised to hear that they finally opened a store in California so we are going to have to visit it, next time we are there.

SOOOO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can I even say that?  I can't believe they have places like this to eat anymore.  I had ordered the corn beef has and eggs, and it came with the BEST home fries I have ever tasted in my life!    This place is not for you to eat at if you are on a diet.  Our waitress was so polite and the entire staff for that matter.  But she did something that has never happened me to before at restaurant. I LOVE zucchini sticks, and on their menu they claim they have the best one in town.  I was joking with her if they could just make one stick for me to try since I was so full from my breakfast, and with in 2 minutes she came out with one fried sick WHAAAAAAT?  I LOVED IT!  If they had a place like this in Tucson I would be eating there everyday!

I'm only giving it four stars because I found uggs that were worth $150 for $29 bucks!  Other than that they place is CRAZY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! People fight and we witnessed a lady being kicked out by the security guard because she was talking about him behind his back.  Be on your best behavior when you go there I hear they don't mess around there!

BEST FRENCH TOAST BREAKFAST!!!  I don't know what they put in the toast, but its sooo good to last bite!  This place is a bar in heart of Phoenix, and its an unlikely breakfast place, but it is and it sooo GOOD! oops I said that already.  YOU MUST GO!

This is my favorite place to eat in Scottsdale whenever I go to Fashion Square. I think it is way better than eating in the food court inside the mall. It's a fun and great atmosphere to have lunch or even dinner and to go for drinks.  I really enjoy the Fox restaurants.

What great place to come for a quick breakfast!  I must admit when we pulled up I saw few people waiting outside and thought and told my husband that I didn't want to go in cause there looks like a line.  But he convinced me that we should just go in.    We walked in and the hostess told us it would be 5-10 minutes I surprised how fast they seated us.  There was soo much to choose from on the menu, but I am such a simple girl I just wanted to egg, bacon, and potatoes, and that's what I got! And the Decaf wasn't too bad either!  The real reason why I chose to eat here was because I read Gabi M's review who is the community manager of Scottsdale/PHX area.  The funniest thing is that just as we got our coffee a guy walked by and I noticed that it was Gabi's husband, then who should be walking behind him GABI!!! Loved that! always great to see you Gabi!!! Thanks for your review!  Great place!

I wish I could eat here every weekend....Kinda.  They are on the pricey side, but you can never go wrong if you can have rice for every meal.  Sorry that's the asian girl in me.    The staff was great, and we ordered the Chocolate souffl√© its a must!

They were rude and I felt all they did was talk to each other and trash talk all the clients that came in.  They could be more customer friendly! Maybe then I would return, but for now two stars is it!

During our three day stay in Scottsdale we visited this CVS twice.  I was happy to find it wasn't too far from our hotel, and it had everything we needed even when we ran out of sunscreen!  The night supervisor was pretty cool he was telling me how great it is to see people use their CVS card.  That's nice to know people care so much about what their company has to offer.

My favorite cupcakes EVER!  Well just the red Velvet!  I love when they put the saguaro's on them I love that, it makes me feel like we they made is especially for me!  Everyone should go and grab a cupcake when they are in the area!  Now all they need is the ATM cupcake machine like that they have in LA.

I think this place was more style of substance.  My husband and I could not find what we were looking for, and the menu was no where near what you would expect from a sushi restaurant , very limited selection with the rolls. And I would have expected better food than what we paid for.  One other thing the hostess greeted us and told us that it would be a 15 min. wait to be seated in the restaurant, and that we should grab a drink at the bar.  As soon as we walked over to the bar I see a group leave some table, and tell my husband lets go there and sit and wait.  While waiting the waitress Victoria comes up and says that we could order dinner here too.  So that it what we did which was fine.  The only things is the hostess never came back to check up on us to see where we were.  I really think that's poor hostessing skills.

THIS IS THE BEST PLACE FOR BREAKFAST!  We had been going to dicks for awhile now and one day we walked in and they said that it was full that morning,  and the waitress told us that Richardson's was up the road.  We never knew this was there.    We usually order the french toast which is AMAZING both Dicks and Richardson's serve the same breakfast.    Service is great and the coffee is even better!

The Tapas was good...I would have given this place more stars, BUT as we were leaving I saw the waiter took one of our water glasses and poured some of our left over water on the table, and used one of our USED napkins to clean the table.  The whole time he was doing the he had a look on his face hoping he wouldn't get caught doing what he was doing..........UNCLEAN!

Whenever we are up in Scottsdale we try to find new places to eat.  Apparently this place is another Fox restaurant.  I am always impressed with the decor of his restaurants.   The food is great we had a flat bread pizza and a spinach salad.  Everything was fresh and tasty!    Again though there were more staff than customers, now a days I don't see why that is.

IF you want a waitress that puts you down for complaining that the mac and cheese is cold EAT HERE!  "Personally I would't eat it, it's too hot for my taste." As she sets it down after they re heated the mac.  UMMM....Yeah I LOVE eating cold mac and cheese. ( THE NEXT DAY! as left overs!) My husband ordered the steak salad and  he asked for it to be cooked medium, but it came out raw.  My flat bread was burnt almost black, and crispy, not the way I would or anyone with food sense would eat it.   The only thing good about this is place that the one star gets is the lemonade mango juice.
