Not great really.  Portion size was small.  Food had some flavor, but overall not something worth waiting for.  We called ahead and still had to wait 30+ minutes.  I had the lamb shanks and there was little to no sauce and the menu said it had mash potatoes.   There was probably two tablespoons.  Atmosphere is cool, but not even close to one of the best restaurants in Peoria.

Much better the second time around.  Food was better.  Got the macadamia nut crusted chicken with rice, tropical salsa, and wasabi sauce.  Service was good cuz I showed up around 5, so the place was pretty empty.  I'll go back.  Not first choice, but a good choice.

So I have been craving Falafel...haven't had good falafel in at least a year.  MMM - that cucmber yogurt with romaine in a delish pita.    I saw this place and saw they had falafel, so was stoked.  Order a large meal.  Well, not sure how they truly do it in Greece, but this place put's some lettuce, tomatoes, falafel, and ranch.  Very americanized if you ask me.    Won't be back.  The search will continue for good falafel.

This place is very good.  I am a native of AZ and know good Mexican.  Great atmosphere, great food, and not too pricey.  Last time there I tried the El Monterrey.  AWESOME!  Tons of food.  4 enchiladas, a chile relleno, a taco, and rice and beans.  If you want a real treat try the dulce de leche cheesecake.  They have down-sized it a bit since they opened, but it is mondo tasty.

Overall pretty good.  Pizza is not over the top amazing, but good.  I like the Sonoran Chicken with the peperoncini sauce...mmmm.   A little spicy, which I like, but not mouth burning.  Also, the wings are good.  I have had both the honey bbq and the hot wings, both are exceptional.

Seriously!?  So I ordered from them twice last week.  Delivery.  They messed up my order just a little (wrong bread) on one of them, eh, no big deal.  The delivery time was OK, but not fast...about 20 minutes.  Well today, I need to leave my house for a job interview at 12:45, so I order at 12:15.  I wait till 12:50, then leave.  My wife is still home... apparently they showed up around 1.  Sorry, but that is not freaky fast, at all!  Then they have the nerve to say I am out of their delivery area.  Then what are you doing?  Did they tell me this and say it make take longer than usual, NO.  Did they decline my order for delivery, NO.   Not to mention why they heck am I out of your delivery range...I live at 87th & Bell - 1 mile from your shop.  I canceled my order and they gave me my money back, but the whole situation is very frustrating!  I love the food and when I have ordered from other locations it is truly freaky fast.  Very disappointed in how this location carries the JJs name.
