This place was awesome!! It took maybe 15 minutes for an oil change and they cleaned the windows. Very efficient. I will definitely be going back.

I've tried this place 3 times because it's so close to my house. Unfortunately, I've been disappointed with their shamefully sloppy gel manicures each time. They always rush through the gel and either put the polish on way to thick or they don't give it enough time to dry between coats. Plus all the employees are rude and hateful.   Like I said, I wish they were better because it's so close to home. Unfortunately, I'm much better off driving an extra 5 minutes to a place that does a decent job.

This is my favorite restaurant of all time. Healthy, fresh and fabulously low key. Love it!

This is the best bridal store in the Valley. I bought my wedding dress, my bridesmaids' dresses, the MOB and MOG dresses AND my jewelry here. I cant say enough about how wonderful this shop is. I had the most amazing experience with Uptown Bridal! I would absolutely recommend this store!

This is our neighborhood go-to and favorite place because it's dog-friendly. We bring our 4 year old vizsla here at least three times a month. The food is great but the setup is really why we come here. Can't beat it if you want to dine with your pooch.

Love this new place! Radish is my favorite. Will definitely have happy hour here one day too. The community dining & bar area is great. Cool industrial design. Will be back for sure.

We had the best time at Sleuth Box last night. We would definitely recommend this to others. It was very challenging but that's what made it so fun! We escaped in 73 min with several hints along the way. Best advice to newbies: don't discount anyone's ideas - they may just be the key to your escape!
