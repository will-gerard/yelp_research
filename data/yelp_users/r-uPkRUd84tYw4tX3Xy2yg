Not good. Server was awful. Wished I sat at the bar - she knew what she was doing. Watch out if you sit on ground floor - dbags on 2nd level susceptible to dropping beer. Security does nothing. Not going back...

I've been a member for a few months and believe the concept for the cost is 5-star or as Yelp states "As good as it gets".  The biggest positives are (i) cleanliness, (ii) lack of classes which limits membership, and (iii) friendly staff.  The 1 star reviews can largely be summarized by clients that couldn't grasp the concept of the gym (which clearly discloses the lack of basketball, swimming, yoga, etc.), couldn't read their contract, or didn't look at the understandable policies (bring your own towel - not a big deal to me).  Similar to LA Fitness, they disclose the price and how to cancel memberships in the fine print.  Spread this cost (as well as the start-up) over 12- or 24-months and the true cost of membership is ~$14-15/month - hard to beat.
