I love Caffe Boa! Great drinks and delicious food, just one thing: what is UP with the size of the beet salad? A little skimpy, don't ya think? :)

It had been years since I'd been to this location, and I will not be going back! Called in the order to be a quick pick up, ended up waiting at the window for 15 minutes for the staff trying to figure out how to split the check on two debit cards! Was treated very rudely by staff member Michelle & "manager" Sara, and upon getting home, the food was made incorrectly! Veggie burrito was just a bean and cheese. Thanks for the memories Someburros but your rude staff and inability to get the food right means it will be another 10 years before I give you my business!

A few weeks ago, I went in for a lunch to use a Village Voice Deal $15 for $30 I purchased. I ordered the Grilled Burrito with no dairy, topped with red sauce, with a side of guaccamus. The server suggested grilled vegetables inside, so I agreed. When my order came out, I reminded the server for the side of guaccamus, and she told me the cook put it inside on accident. I said it was fine, and proceeded to cut into the burrito. Inside I discovered no rice, a few beans; basically a grilled vegetable runny guaccamus mess. She came by so I apologized for being difficult but pointed out this is not what I ordered and wasn't what I wanted it. She apologized and told me the cook had made it wrong the first time, so this was his second try, and she took it back. Once my food came out, the burrito has shrunk half to its original size, but it was 2:30, so I thanked her and ate it anyway. She took my burrito off the check; so once again, I had the Village Voice deal to use.  Yesterday, I called and told the woman on the phone I had the coupon and I wanted to place a to-go order. I ordered the to-go guaccamus, which is on the menu under A La Carte. I've ordered it before, so I know it comes in a large container. I also ordered chicken lettuce wraps; the woman on the phone said I could get the lunch order for cheaper and half the size. Since I was only ordering for myself but looking to spend $30 on the coupon, I agreed with her suggestion. So as a second thought, I told her I would take the Taco Salad as well, no dairy, dressing on the side. She asked if I wanted chicken, and I calculated that this would put me over $30 so I could run a tip on my debit card, so once again I agreed with her suggestion.  When I got to the restaurant, I presented the girl at the bar with my coupon and as she was giving me a receipt for $27, I was bombarded by a flustered, rude older man in a dress shirt practically shouting at me it was dine-in only. I explained to him that I had been there before to try and use it but my order was wrong, so is there anyway I could be made an exception? He grabbed my receipt and went to the register, and brought me back a receipt for $2, saying the order went over the total. I felt bad so I tipped her $7. He walked away and I reminded her I told her about it on the phone: she took the blame and apologized. I was really uncomfortable so I went back to my car. Before I left, checked my order.  The first box had the half order of chicken lettuce wraps: check. The second was the taco salad, which appeared to me to be iceberg lettuce and grilled chicken on top, with no much else. No dressing. Then I opened the third container, which had one side of guaccamus and a million fried wonton chips. So I went back inside because the one thing I really wanted, the to-go guaccamus, was wrong. Once again I was bombarded by this older man, yelling at the server across the bar she would have to ring me up separately, while she told me that I ordered the guaccamus a la carte, and so that is what I ordered. My receipt was still on the bar, so I opened it up and looked at the bill. I had been rung up for a full order of chicken lettuce wraps, the taco salad plus chicken, and one side of guaccamus, which obviously is not what I ordered. At this point I was starting to get angry so I just grabbed my food and left. It was once I got back to my office that I realized I had paid $9, on top of the $15 I already paid for my Village Voice Deal, for a side of guacamole, some wontons I didn't want, three small lettuce wraps and the worst salad I'd ever seen.  Never. Again.

The best nail salon in Tempe! They get very busy on Saturdays so best to make an appointment but that's because they are so good. There are endless gel polishes to choose from, the staff are courteous and skilled and I get compliments on my nails every time. I send everyone who asks me to AZ Tip and Toes.

The food is just not that great. I've ordered it three times now because they deliver and tried several dishes but all have lacked any flavor or spice, two things you look for specifically in Thai food. If you like bland noodles and chicken, then you can bet this is a place to eat. One redeeming dish was the wonton soup, I thought it wasn't bad. But you can get good wonton soup anywhere. With all the Thai options in Tempe and Phoenix, Papaya Thai just doesn't stand up to the competition.

We went to Rehab for a late lunch today and while it started out with good intentions, in the end we were extremely disappointed. On the bright side, I loved the decor. It's very well done with the surfer vibe and the sweet potato tots are some of the best I've had.   The real issues were coming out of the kitchen. As I was people watching, I noticed tables coming in. I also noticed table by table, food was coming out for them before ours. Shortly after we ordered our second round of drinks smoke did fill the small restaurant and we made jokes about our food being on fire, so we chalked it up to our order actually being the cause of the smoke. It was a late lunch so by this time it was past well past 1 p.m. Our server cruised by and said we were waiting on the wings one of us ordered.  Finally the food arrived and it couldn't have been the wings, since they were cold. Both burgers had burned pretzel buns, and one side of tots was half a serving of cold tots. The server said he would bring more, then never returned. The restaurant was quite busy, so we took matter in our own hands and asked someone to bring the tots and fill our drinks, but the burgers weren't great. We ate them anyway because at this point we were just so hungry!  Finally we were waiting for our check to be split and who I assumed is the manager came by our table and asked how it was. We were honest and told him it wasn't great. He arrogantly replied "Not great? But you ate all your food" I looked at him and said "Yeah because I waited a long time for my food while all these tables who came in after us were served their meals" It was ridiculous, I watched many of those tables leave as well while we were dealing with our tab.   He pressed the issue, even though we didn't want to get into it because a) it seemed petty and b) we just wanted to leave, but he insisted . We told him our issues with the meal and 10 min later he returned with the food removed off the menu. The weirdest thing was his delivery. He pinned the checks on the table facing us so we could read it, and goes, "How are we doing this" holding our cards in his hand. I  pointed to my check and said "I'm the blue card, so that's mine" He just stared at me. I repeated, "I'm the blue card" and reached over to pull the card out of his grip, and he goes, "Okay, so the $2 on the blue card and the $6 on the red card"   It was sooo rude. His demeanor was that we were being ungrateful, when we honestly just wanted to leave. When he returned he was full of excuses, (we're a new restaurant, we are very busy, etc.) which is FINE. I eat out all the time, and new restaurants all the time, and I expect growing pains, so I told him I liked the place, I would be back to watch a game, grab a drink. He replied, "Well we are not a bar with good food. We are a restaurant with good drinks."   What the hell? First of all, I wasn't even drinking, so I was just trying to be NICE. Thanks for not taking our constructive criticism YOU ASKED FOR then making us feel BAD about the discount you gave us that we weren't looking for. It was such a turn off, we talked about it the whole ride home and all day I've been telling people what a nightmare it was when they asked me about it due to me checking in on social media  So I lied to the manager... I won't be back. There are plenty of other mediocre burger shops around town that I can give my business to, and if I do end up there again, I'll be ordering the wings and tots. Their burgers are average. For a place with BURGER in the name, there is just absolutely nothing special about their signature menu item. Shoulda gone to In N Out.

I work in downtown Tempe, so among all the places to eat within walking distance, this is by far one of the best in the Mill Ave District. It's a comparable price point to the other healthier locations but I appreciate the creativity put into the daily rotating menu and the quaint courtyard to eat in, away from the street. If you need it to go, you've got it within 5 minutes. My kind of place!

We love Nighttime Nosh! Everything you could need they bring right to your door, and the delivery men I've had are polite and easy to work with. People don't believe me when I say you can have wine delivered to your door, but hello, you can have wine delivered to your door. One of the best services around, one of many reasons I enjoy living in Tempe!
