Always fresh, fat, and delicious. Never stingy with the sauce either. Good dudes, good burritos.

2016 EDIT: since selling the property again, getting rid of all the veteran employees and downgrading availability and service, I have to drop this rating significantly. How are you going to run a large complex, through the summer, with nothing but new hires and with 3 less people than before? Gimmie a break. I had to crawl under the propane grills and reconnect the tanks to cook out at the freezing ass cold pool because apparently everyone here is sleeping on that. Don't plan on renewing this lease. Late 2015: Great property all around! Love the layout, grounds, staffing, maintenance, etc. Prime location right off the 101, still in Tempe without the hectic traffic and college noise. Would definitely recommend.

Clean business. Absolutely no customer service unless you only want to speak Spanish. Unless Luis is going to cut your hair and you're willing to wait, you might as well go to great clips for the same shit but with someone with actual people skills and customer service. The customer shouldn't have to walk themselves to the chair, greet the stylist, then proceed to tell them everything they want. Half of this experience is the customer service and 90% of customer service is being able to greet customers and hold a conversation. As for the actual hair cut, she spent 15 minutes lining up the hair around my ears and beard and hardly took anything off anywhere else. Apparently a 2 guard here is a different size than any other barbershop. Take the day off of work, drive to Tempe and go to Brigade on Mill.
