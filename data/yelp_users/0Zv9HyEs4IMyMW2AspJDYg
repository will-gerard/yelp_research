An exceedingly rare example of a mechanic you can put your 100% trust in. Jack will go out of his way to do it right with the least money coming out of pocket. I had my older Porsche as a daily driver for 5 years, and he's helped me out with rides, tows, etc.   You'll never have to worry about add-on maintenance as an upsell or questionable practices. All the mechanics are great too!

I've been searching for my dream car for 2 years. When I found it a Chapman Chevy, I made an appointment that same day. I test drove it and loved it. They offered to hold the vehicle for me for a $500 deposit, and I accepted. They charged my credit card, and I set an appointment the next day to handle the sale.  I was on my way to the dealership the morning of the sale when I received a phone call. Someone had offered to wire transfer the money, and they sold the car that I had placed the deposit on. The sales guy mentioned that another party had put a deposit in before I did and claimed no one recorded it. However, the sales manager, Howard, mentioned that deposits only hold deals that are offered, not vehicles. However, this was not the case as there were several witnesses when this was explained to me (in employees in the finance department). 2 different stories, and one or both are lies.  Unfortunately after making a couple phone calls to managers, they don't care. Unethical and possible illegal- STAY AWAY FROM CHAPMAN CHEVY.

My favorite hotel in Scottsdale. Style, flair, and a location you can't beat. It's completely unique to anything you would stay in- definitely worth a visit. Great rates to boot.

Awesome massages here, and they have some of the most polite and inviting staff that I have seen in Arizona.  This place makes makes regular massage and chriopractic work affordable- there is no reason why you can't come here on a regular basis.

The food is awesome, but the service here is great. I asked about options for my girlfriend since she cant have bread, and they not only prepared a lettuce wrap but offered to sanitize the counter since bread was prepared on it. It wasnt necessary, but it was great for him to offer!
