I love this place.  The pizzas are great, but their salads are my favorite.  I love the antipasto salad with their house made dressing.  I have eaten here more times than I can count and will keep coming back for more.

Longest wait & worst service.  Even with an appointment I waited an hour in the waiting room and then another 40 minutes in the patient room.    Additionally, I left a phone message for the doctor (Verdejo) and was never called back.     Choose a different PCP if you can.  It's not worth it.

We love Urban Cookies.  Whenever we're on that side of town, we always stop in and get a treat.  We love the ice cream cookies they have in the summer.  They're so big we have to share.  All the cupcakes are so delicious.  Yummy!

A restaurant with "fish" as part of it's name should know how to cook fish perfectly.  I ate there twice because I wanted to give them a second chance...mistake.  The fish was overcooked and dry (both times) and the lobster was rubbery.  It was such a let down.  The lobster bisque that Costco sells is far better than the bland version at Kings.  They did have a decent California roll though.  I was disappointed and will avoid this place in the future.

I eat lunch here a couple times a week. I've had a couple different curries & they're great. Thai tea is good too.
