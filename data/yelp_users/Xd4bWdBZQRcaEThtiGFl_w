Took a random light rail train from Osborn for lunch and ended up going South. A quick YELP search on my BB and I found Blue Fin right off the McDowell stop.  I had their "healthy chicken bowl" with some nice pieces of chicken, a TON of veggies (cabbage, broccoli, carrots, etc) and BROWN rice. This, with a big glass of iced green tea only set me back $8.60 and was wonderful. I sat on their patio, watched the trains and traffic go by and had a nice, relaxed lunch. I'll definitely go back.

Total dive bar - which is my kind of place. I bought the Amazon Local deal (punch card with 3 $10 credits) and came today to try it out for the first time.  Took a seat at the bar and got instant greets from bartender and the cook (score). Bottled beer came ice cold (score) with menu. Ordered Wineburger and fries $6 lunch. Condiment and napkin service appeared instantly (score). Watched some TV (no hassle about swapping over to golf) and burger came in decent time. PERFECT taste and doneness! Second beer delivered timely and no chasing someone down to pay and get back to work. Lunch experience awesome so don't be scared by other reviews if you work nearby and want good,  cheap grub, with friendly prompt service.

Normally I love this place but today management failed. They were understaffed to a criminal degree which is bad for employees and patrons. Its not like the Derby came as a surprise.  Never coming back for a special event here. I did go to the 7th St and Union Hills location for Preakness and had a MUCH better experience. Get your act together on 16th St and I could be persuaded to try again.

Great place for breakfast or anything. French Toast w/ sausage LINKS is the best, except for the steak and eggs. Burgers and wings both great; just generally good food!

I'd give it 5 stars if they had sports audio instead of the earl 90s pop music. Sheryl Crow does not belong playing in a sports bar.  Food is excellent; service at the bar is awesome. I've never sat at a table, so no clue on general seating service. It does tend to collect a rough crowd, but generally well behaved and friendly. OTB can be fun way to lose $40

Great food and awesome staff. Brigett runs a great neighborhood sports bar. Steak and eggs special on weekends that go great with a bloody mary.

Change of ownership brought this formerly 5 star dive bar to negative rating. The place caters to thugs and drunks who they over serve. If you ask the bartender to take control of her patrons, you get called terms which can't be typed on Yelp, because the drunk patron is also an employee. Stay away from this place if you want to have a good, safe experience.

Coldest beers around - the taps are chilled and mugs frozen. Great place to grab a beer and a bite before or after the movies. Comes with a great people watching patio too.

5 stars are hard to get...  Kona Grill Scottsdale Fashion square is a tasty place to reboot during a marathon shopping day. The mall has a lot of tasty food choices, but the Grill's mix of chique plus sports on TV is perfect for any shopping couple.   Food is ALWAYS excellent and even better on happy hour (3-7, Mon-Fri, 11-2 Sat, and ALL DAY Sun). I'm a big fan of the chicken satay.  Drinks are fresh, though I'd skip the red sangria next time. Full bar w/ $4 well drinks at HH.  On the patio you can people watch all the Fashionista as the arrive at the valet parking are for the mall OR catch up on the games on any of their dozen or so flat screens hung around the bar. Just look up and you get your sports fix.  Kona is the must stop whenever you shop Scottsdale Fashion Square.

The Gap at Scottsdale Fashion Square always has a great inventory of sale items. I always come away with at least one item for my closet.

Food and service are excellent. Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is price...expect to spend a couple more dollars per dish than other sports bar menus.

Awesome new owners for last 3 years and I didn't know it! We came here today cuz they were open on Easter Sunday. Mystic is a great lady and running an excellent joint. We split the ribeye sandwich and fresh cut fries... Simply to die for! We'll be back!

Awesome sushi with reasonable prices. We sat at the bar and ordered some rolls and sushi. Everything came out in good time and was well formed and tasty. Saki bombers were perfect. Great local spot for dinner. They open for dinner at 5 so plan to come after.

The best neighborhood sushi spot. The service, food and set up are perfect. Not the plastic sushi you get is Scottsdale, but the family-run small business version that makes America great. When we talk about having sushi, we know we're talking going to Hana.

I dropped off my first order yesterday after growing tired of my old dry cleaner's ways. I found the $6 off coupon online (go to their website) so decided to give Billy's a try. While there, I watched the Saturday morning attendant work a couple other customers ahead of me. She was FAST, EFFICIENT, FRIENDLY and KNOWLEDGEABLE (All the things my fly-by-night place was missing). When it was my turn, I mentioned the ad and that I was trying them out the first time. She smiled and quickly went about sorting my stuff, asking questions about how I like things, etc. Then - the most amazing thing happened. Another client who'd overheard me say I was new chimed in and said I'd grow to LOVE Billy's. She'd been going there for 10+ years and found the staff SUPER FRIENDLY. I'm looking forward to my Monday pickup.  Quick NOTE: you don't pay up front, but on pick up - that says a lot about the kind of business this is.

Great food except for the pasta...make sure to check appetizers closely, cuz their are some gems there like the stuffed mushrooms.  Perfect place for March Madness, watching fall football, or just hanging out with friends. Live music on Fri/Sat and UFC fights make it a full-service entertainment spot.

This place is getting over a couple years of being the worst option in the area. If you were here in the past 18 months and swore you'd never go back, think again. The staff is updated with the best for Big Guy's and Catch looks to be a place to go again.

Awesome staff. Sat at the counter and watched tons of great looking food go by. I went for the "Lil ol Country Girl" which is an egg, bacon, sausage, and biscuit and gravy. The kitchen claims proudly "I come from a family where gravy is considered a beverage." And they delivered the best gravy I've ever passed by my lips. We will definitely be back.

Love this place! I live 20 minutes away, but my girlfriend and I go there at least twice a month.  Hula's has a great patio/bar atmosphere. They serve 4 different fish (and tofu) cooked 5 different ways. Tonight I had the Mahi with the Macadamia Nut crust preparation, which comes with a spicy mango salsa, sticky rice and coleslaw (which has something in it that makes you ask yourself how they make it!).  The restaurant is right off the Light Rail line and perfect for casual dinner with friends. Oh - and you have to try the sweet potato fries... yum!

Stopped in to try Pho for the first time and will be back soon for seconds. The place smells AMAZING as you walk in. Only complaint is it was on the warm side so I was glad to not be staying but just picking up a to go order. The dish was so delicious and more than enough for two huge helpings. The herbs, jalape√±o, sprouts and limes were all fresh and gorgeous even after the 15 minute ride home and sit before I got down to eating. The noodles were perfect and finished up cooking in the hot broth as I did the assembly. I also picked up spring rolls but those will be lunch tomorrow. They look gorgeous and I expect will taste great too.

Awesome pizza and a great way to support local merchants. Just got done scarfing some meatball and mushroom (yes, they're fresh, not canned!). They have a great, thin crust with toppings covering edge-to-edge. The one thing to get used to is its shape - the larger pizzas come oval, not round.  If you're looking for a pizza that's delicious and made with love, go to Rochelli's!

Great dinner Friday night! This place is the only spot for pizza in the North-Central valley. We had meatball, mushroom, and onion; mushrooms were fresh (not canned) and meat just spicy enough. Rochelli's has the perfect crust and sauce. We had a couple beers while waiting for our pie, and watched some football on the new televisions.

Last night, it was late and I was searching my fridge - and there was the wonderful, savory snack - leftover Rochelli's pizza. Any pizza can be good or even great hot out of the oven. But an excellent leftover is hard to find.  Order a large on your next visit and breakfast doesn't have to be a bowl of cold Wheaties.

I buy the fresh today whole bean coffee every few weeks for home. only thing I would change is the opening hours. The place just doesn't open up early enough for me to get breakfast and get to work on time.

Great Saturday hang out to watch the game. Staff is very friendly and attentive; patrons are all nice people. Had the bbq pork today and it was amazing! Rich, spicy sauce and pulled pork that melted in my mouth. Pair with sweet potato fries and I'll be in a good comma soon.

Killer bbq. Had the 3 meat platter with brisket, chicken and sausage. All good. Best part is they serve it plain and you add your sauce. This allows you to taste the meat. Try the collard greens for a down home treat! Cowboy beans were best I've had since last trip to Pinnacle Peak Patio.

Awesome food at the Tilted Kilt. Yes, the waitresses have the little outfits, but they do a great job too. Plenty of tvs to watch the games and unlike other sports bars, this place turns the audio on.

Don't come in for a beer cuz they don't have any... Chips and salsa not as good as Chuys was and the menu was a) inaccessible (I don't want to read a novel, I just want some tacos) and b) EXPENSIVE!!!  The staff seemed entirely disinterested in working or engaging the customers. Yes, there were TVs - half were tuned to infomercials. Most striking was the deafening silence -no music, no TV audio, no nothing. I won't be going back.

Staff - awesome, attentive, and unselfish. I was greeted before I could fully cross the threshold and had random folks refill my water and ask if I needed anything. Matt, by bartender, upgraded my pint to a pitcher (same price in HH) but served in my pint glass two perfect Porters  Pizza was awesome! Even passed the leftover for breakfast test next morning.

Amazing! I gorged on the blueberry pancakes and wanted more though I was over filled. All of the staff was attentive and cheerful. As a customer you instantly feel at home. Ever since leaving I've dreamt of going back. Make sure you get the fresh Orange juice.

Best pizza, calzones and sandwiches in town. My favorite is a sausage (housemade), mushrooms (fresh not canned crap), and onion pizza. And you must NOT miss the onion rings. Casual place to pick up and take home, or hang out and have a slice. Skip the mass-produced plastic crap and come here to get real pizza.
