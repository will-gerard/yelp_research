Worst company ever... the internet is horrendous, might as well have dial up.  Customer service is just as bad... please go elsewhere, they don't care about their customers one bit.

Just moved to Tempe from Gilbert and walked into this place a month or so ago because I needed a quick haircut.  There was a heavy wait but I was ok with it as I knew it was a last minute thing at 7pm.  I was finally called upon and Laura introduced Herself and she was great from the get go, not only was she the best at conversing, but the hair cut was darn good too.  I left extremely happy and I am glad I waited.  I found myself a month later (today) needing a haircut and decided to go back and low and behold the lovely girl who cut my hair last time was at the front to greet me.  I asked for her again and she got me in fairly quick, I was impressed she remembered just about everything we talked about the first time and the conversation was just as good if not better, Laura makes the haircut enjoyable and I highly recommend her and this place, everyone there is super friendly.
