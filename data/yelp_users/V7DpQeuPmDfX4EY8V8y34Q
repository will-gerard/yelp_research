Not a huge fan. This is very authentic Chinese just so you know. I have to watch my sodium and after eating here my ankles and feet swelled. If your looking for frog this is your place. Most menu is in Chinese language and wait staff are hard to understand.

Thank you goes to two of my co-workers for recommending this hidden gem. I had Jake the snake with Dutch crunch roll bread. Amazingly good!! I can't wait to come back so many choices. I look forward to Ike's sandwiches- by far the best sandwich shop.

One of the only times I've been let down by yelpers. I have no idea how this pizza joint has 4 stars. We got take out. There pizza was doubled thin crust pizza which I am not a fan of and the garlic strips were like wood. I like Chicago style pizza.
