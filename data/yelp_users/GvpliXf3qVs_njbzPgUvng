I've been going to Lulu's since I was probably 5 years old, my dad used to take me when all I cared about were bean burritos. 18 years later I can still say Lulu's is one of the best Mexican food places I've ever been.  I agree with a lot of what has already been said: chips and salsa are not free which is a total bust, some of the stuff is WAY overpriced, and... can we talk about the price of refills?? $0.79 no matter what size soda you bought? I definitely got screwed on that one by buying a small soda thinking I would get free refills...  It IS a hole in the wall. It's a great summer lunch place or an early dinner after a long day at the pool. Everything I've had: carne asada, bean burro, the salsa, they are all good. Just pricey. How did I pay $9 for a drink, a bean burrito, a street taco and some chips?? I will never know. Yelp is wrong, I feel like $10 and under should not be considered cheap per person, but that's what I have to put since all the entrees are about $10. But it was really, really good. I would rather pay like $7.50 but I don't eat there every day and I understand there must be some underlying cost we aren't aware of.  Oh, and they have CRUSHED ICE!! (The good kind like at Sonic) So I'm sold.  Thanks Lulu!

I always have a great experience with Enterprise, and this occasion was no exception. Zack was professional, kind, and courteous from start to finish-- from the early morning pickup on Friday to the processing of my return on Tuesday evening. The size car I reserved was available, and the choice I made between two, the Chevy Sonic, was perfect: clean inside and out, plenty of cup holders, great on gas, superb technology (Bluetooth integration, OnStar, AND, though I couldn't figure it out, 4G wifi!) and I got a great deal using some points I have accumulated over the last couple of years. They will really do everything in their power to make your rental an excellent one.  Also, pro-tip: the refill on gas at their rate is often the better deal compared to local prices. Note the current local price and take their offer!  Thanks Zack, and everyone at the West Tempe location. I will definitely be back!

Best manicure I've ever had! Kevin was very professional and patient when I couldn't decide what color I wanted. Everyone in the salon is friendly, and I didn't feel like an intruder or like I was interrupting like I do in some places I've had my nails done. The quality of the manicure and the time Kevin took to ensure there were no missed details like stray polish or missed edges.  HUGE variety of colors and quality brands: Color Club, ORLY, OPI, and Essie to name a few! I am going to recommend this place to my mom who loves a good pedicure. I know she will love it! :)

I really liked Coffee Rush when I first started going. I used to meet here with a church group and it was the perfect location for low volume discussion. Good atmosphere, tasty drinks. Plus the prices of drinks can't be beat.  I am disappointed however with my first solo experience there at Coffee Rush, and have not gone back since and probably never will. I needed to work several hours on a long paper for my grad school class, and to begin my session I grabbed a tasty looking peach tea. I was then informed that I would need to spend at least 3.99 to use my debit card. I thought it was odd because most businesses do not have stipulations like that, especially when they are as frequented as Coffee Rush. I didn't mind so much, and purchased a bottle of water to drink later.  I sat down to open my computer and get online to access my... ONLINE... class materials. Found out I had to have a code to access wi-fi. I thought that was fair, we don't need anyone stealing internet I suppose. So I got the code and spent the next three hours chugging away at my paper.  At the end of three hours, the internet access apparently ended. There was a time limit, so I had to go back up to the counter to ask for another code. It was clear I was working, clear that I had purchased two drinks to have during my visit, and was informed that I could not receive an additional code unless I purchased another drink. I wasn't thirsty at all, I had two drinks already, and asked the man behind the counter if my bottled water counted as the second drink....  "No, it has to be something I make for you here behind the counter. So maybe a frappucino, a latte, a chai..." I thanked him and gathered my belongings to leave. I understand needing to pay for the wi-fi many are using for free, but i wasn't going to spend another $4 to have internet that I could be using at home.  I would like Yelp to consider changing the Wi-Fi information for this location. If I have to pay more money to use a service, that would not qualify as free... Avoid Coffee Rush and head to It's A Grind if you have a lot of work to do and intend on long hours...

One of the reasons I love It's A Grind is because they are very VERY comparative to Starbucks. I do love me some S-Bux but the pricing and the lack of free wi-fi have prompted me to look elsewhere for a coffee house experience.  I would definitely give It's A Grind another star if they were open later and their specialty drinks weren't extremely overpriced.  A half coffee/half milk blended drink (small size) is $5?! Well, with that said... this is a MUCH better alternative to Coffee Rush because, well, I'll write about them in their review section...  Staff is very friendly, atmosphere is comfortable, and usually I can focus well when I need to study or write a paper. Drinks are GREAT and they even offer a regular black tea: my favorite since I'm not a real avid coffee drinker! Plus it's close to the shopping center and they offer great little snacks to go with your drink. I can't recommend it enough. Go now!
