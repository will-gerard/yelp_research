Love love love this place! Their hot wings are my fav. and also the meatball sub is so good too. My husband loves the calzones and the pizza is always a great go to. If you are looking for something healthier- go for the Strawberry spinach and apple walnut are so so yummy! We have craving nights for this place.

This place was okay, but once was enough. The meat was good quality and the concept is fun however I strongly believe that if you are going to advertise something you better make it good and I have had better chili out of can! The chili they put on my dog lacked meat and flavor. In fact it tasted more like glorified ketchup. It might sound petty but that's how I feel. I can make a better chili dog at home and I will not be back.

I love Pita Jungle! The gyro is my favorite with hummus. The cauliflower is awesome too and any of the hummus on there own is great! They also have really nice and healthy choices for kids too, which is great. All too often healthy restauranta don't always appeal to kids. So great place lunch, dinner or take out! Yummy!

Great people! I was a new Nanny looking for a great fit and they found me a wonderful family. I watch two little girls (6 &7) sweet kids and the parents are super nice too. They have also been amazing about finding me families to babysit for also! Jen is fantastic, very caring, organized and all about what and who is going to be a Perfect Fit for both nanny and family!

I really like this place. Its tasty, healthy but its still a bit expensive. Still, the do a great job if you're looking for healthy and fast. I usually create my own bowl, which is nice, because I get what I want, and I love that they give you a good amount of the protein (specifically shrimp, in my case). I also really enjoy the agave bbq yogurt-delicious! And the smoothies are yummy too.My personal favorite is the Oxidation Elimination- lots of fruits-love it! I usually go to lunch here on Fridays, kind of a nice way to end the week and a healthy way to start to weekend.

This place is so fun! Definitely try the cauliflower and the oyster shooters! The burger place was great too. I really enjoy having a bunch of options and the atmosphere is very unique.
