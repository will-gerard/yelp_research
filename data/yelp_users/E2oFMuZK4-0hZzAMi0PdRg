Very good Thai. Had the spicy chicken cashew, and it was really, really good. Great flavor...just thought the portion was a little bit too small, as I was definitely wanting more!  Also had the "Siamese Twins" of Chicken & Seafood, along with bamboo shoots & green beans in green curry, and would definitely recommend this dish.   Server/staff was humorous and amusing throughout the meal, and added to the peculiar ambiance of this restaurant  Great restaurant

Old Town staple for breakfast...always busy, always a short wait (but with bar stools at the counter often), but well worth it. Large plates with decent-sized portions, potatoes O'brien are great addition to each item, and the fresh fruit is a refereshing change from standard breakfast fruit portions, large and full of watermelon, canteloupe, and pineapple. My personal favorite is the The Bird Omelette. Great food, service is normally decent, but not great, but always left Breakfast Club satisfied.

Great little place off the side of Hayden road that everyone seems to have seen the sign for...but well worth the stop. Going downstairs into this little basement takes you away from the external heat and desert setting and into a small restaurant with candles and wood interior. Great little atmosphere.  The bread was out quickly before dinner and our server was excellent and quick to refill water or bring another glass of wine. I had the crispy grouper and that was very solid...fairly light, good-sized portion. We also had the scallops and they were good. But the highlight of the meal was without a doubt the Shrimp San Remo...large shrimp in olive oil, garlic, sundried tomatoes...bread to dip into the delicious concoction...simply amazing.  One thing to note, Salt Cellar is not cheap...average plate is roughly $30-40...so not a cheap nite out. But for good food, and a great atmosphere (anniversary, date nite, birthday, etc), this is a good call.

If looking for a standard Vegas casino hotel to party at, this isn't it. But if you're looking for a quiet, clean, comfortable place and to do your partying on the Strip, this is idea. I was here for work, and was pleasantly surprised at the hotel.  It's a quiet, clean hotel with no gambling, but decent little hotel bar, a breakfast/deli/snack bar,  well-appointed rooms, and an excellent workout facility. The property is right across from the convention center, and a few blocks off the Strip. Taxis are easy enough to catch to the strip, and about $10 to the closer casinos. The pool is slightly disappointing, as it's deep in the middle of a courtyard that barely receives any sunlight, so sun time is limited to just a couple hours a day. However, the pool is open 24 hours, and there were always people down there, day and night, drinks in hand. Parking is free too.

This little hidden gem of a Thai restaurant on the southeast corner of Mcdowell & Hayden roads (next to the Subway) is simply fantastic Thai food (some of the best I've had in the States, and I've spent considerable time in Thailand), and the we go every two weeks or so. I've never had anything that has been anything other than fantastic.  To start with, the salads are excellent...Larb salad (odd name, I know) is good, the silver noodle salad (the clear noodles really add to the salad), and shrimp salad is our favorite, very simple, but excellent dressing and the shrimp are flavored/grilled to perfection. The pad thai, the most standard Thai dish, was excellent as expected, but the Rad Nar is my favorite noodle dish from La's. For curry, the red is what I see other people ordering the most when there, but my favorite curry is the sweet masaman, and La's makes a good masaman. The pineapple curry is good too, and if it's the available, the seasonal pumpkin curry is unique and delicious.  As to the other dishes, they're all good... but without a doubt, the highlight of the rest of the menu is the spicy salmon dish...spicy salmon, NOT breaded, with vegetables in a dark, spicy sauce is simply amazing...not enough words to describe this. The salmon is crispy, and holds the flavor of the dish. The vegetables fantastic.  To wash it down, the Thai tea is a great deal...$2...where other places it's $3 or $4.  Lastly, the service is good...just a standard little unpretentious Thai spot, with a couple of very sweet little Thai ladies working there... they're friendly and the food is out quick, whether for dine in or takeout.  Great spot!

Went to Enso for a pair of business dinners...and was mildly surprised. First of all, the restaurant is definitely larger than it appears, with a fairly large lounge to the right of the entry way. The restaurant is nicely decorated, modern and well designed. The sushi menu had a decent variety of rolls, plenty of rolls with lots of fresh fish on top. Sushi was good (Bobcat & Toro Crunch rolls stood out), sashimi was decent. The drinks were not cheap, and also weren't very strong.  The highlight of both meals we had was definitely the seabass. Absolutely fantastic...large portion, cooked to perfection. Simply delicious, and I would highly recommend to anyone eating here.  For dessert, the server brought us a "green tea ice cream roll"...kind of gimicky...but absolutely delicious and a great touch to end a meal. Additionally, their kitchen is open late for sushi in Charlotte, and that was very convenient. The only downside to the restaurant was the service. Both times the servers were very friendly...but also very absent. One of our servers forgot to put in our order until we reminded her. One was very knowledgeable, the other knew little more about the menu than we, the patrons, did. The commonality between the two was that it took 10-20 minutes each time after we'd finished eating for our servers to even appear, much less get the bill. A shame, because it was cast such a negative shadow on an otherwise good dinner.

Just tried this place on Friday night for the 1st time...and loved it. Very much like the little noodle restaurants hidden on little side streets all over Hong Kong. Just a small dive eatery, basic tables and minimal decor, chopsticks and spoons sitting in holders on the table for patrons to get themselves. The clientele was heavily Asian when we were there...as every table looked to have at least one Asian person, lending a degree of authenticity to the place. The menu is minimal, maybe 40 items in total, including soups and appetizers, and split in to four primary sections: appetizers, "special" noodle dishes, soup noodles, and fried noodles. The noodles are made fresh for each dish, and after you order, you can watch the noodle guy making your noodles through a big window that separates the kitchen from the dining room. He pulls and stretches the dough, and 5 minutes later you're eating those noodles. Great noodles too! For soup, we had the fish ball soup, which is roundish, white balls of fish stuffed with a ground pork mix, and cooked in soup. Very good.  The first dish that came out was the shrimp with corn noodles in curry, and that was great. We simply devoured that dish. We also had the seafood noodle soup, and that was good. Not as full of flavor as the curry dish, but a nice, standard Asian soup. A nice feature was the amount of squid included in the soup, and the cuttlefish ball. Finally, we had #34 on the menu, the spicy beef with the XO sauce (though we actually substituted chicken for the beef), and it definitely has a little bit of chili powder and kick. Not extremely hot, but just enough spice to mix with the flavor to produce a great dish. The only thing I'd change is that they were pretty heavy on the amount of onions in the dish, but overrall great dish. Service was quick, efficient, tables are turned quickly, and food came out quickly. On top of that, the place is CHEAP! Most of the dishes are $5.95, at best, and several are under $5.

Driven by this restaurant and figured I had to give it a try...and was absolutely disappointed. The owners have done a great job of decorating the interior, and the touches are modern (cucumber slices in the water, service bar, etc)...but for good authentic Thai food, this is not the place. The service staff was two Asian ladies that were very friendly...but with the open kitchen in the back, I could clearly see that the cooks were two Mexican guys. Mexican guys making "authentic" Thai food? Hoping for the best, I ordered the Basil Chicken with vegetables (along with Pad Thai, this is probably the most basic, common Thai dish). However, this was disappointing, as the food lacked Thai flavor, the chicken was overcooked, and instead of having good Asian flavor...was simply spicy. Very disappointed. The Pad See-iew was ok, but acceptable at best.  Prices are generally $12-18 for dinner menu, so not the cheapest of Thai restaurants. Lunch specials were $8 or so. Looking at the menu, definitely an interesting menu of salads and soups that sounds good...so if you're someone that thinks Pei Wei is authentic Asian food, this is your spot. Good service, cute decor, great spot for a work lunch. But if you're about the authenticity and quality of the food, try the nearby Thai Lahna or La's Thai.

Went to this restaurant for the first time this past Saturday, seeing the $2 margaritas All Day sign out front. The restaurant itself is very clean, very modern, TV outside (the NCAA basketball game was on), and very friendly hostess and staff.  For starters, we ordered several of the margaritas, fully expecting sampler margaritas in small glasses...I mean, what restaurant has full-size margaritas for $2 on a Saturday afternoon??? Well, apparently this one does! Full-size house margaritas for $2. And they were good! Absolutely best Saturday afternoon deal in the Valley! For food, the fried camarones appetizer was good, and came out hot. The Tricolor chicken enchiladas were DELICIOUS, and presentation was excellent. (After seeing mine, a patron at another table ordered the same, and thanked me for the idea afterwards, as she enjoyed the dish too) My friend ordered the Shrimp Empanada, and was a big fan of that dish too. Again, the presentation on it was excellent.  Everything about this restaurant was fantastic, and I'll definitely be returning.   One thing to note is that it IS a little difficult to reach if you're going WEST on Baseline...it's wedged almost against the I10, so you'll basically have to flip a U-turn at some point to start heading back EAST. (if you're heading EAST to begin with, no problems). Next to the Waffle House.

Hands down the best bike shop in town. An old-school bike shop run by a guy that really loves bikes. French is as good of a mechanic as it gets...he's a walking encyclopedia on any and every bike going back 30 years. His work is always fairly priced, no unnecessary repairs ordered, and he'll even tell you what you can do yourself to some $$$. If his repairs or overhaul aren't complete, he makes it right. Refreshing to find a mechanic you can truly trust
