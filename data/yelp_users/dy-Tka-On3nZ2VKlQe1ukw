While the food is always good at any Pizza Hut, my main beef with this location is their delivery drivers. The past two times I put in an order online, I mentioned what code they needed to enter to get past the gate. But they called me anyway to have me head down to get the pizza from them. I'm most likely gonna have my pizza delivered from elsewhere.

This is my new favorite breakfast spot! The food is great, the atmosphere is fun, and the more mimosas are delicious. I'll definitely come back here for more!
