Sure it's a bit scuzzy, but they have a wall of freakin' Slurpee machines filled with booze.    It's really the antithesis of everything a good cocktail should be.  And I should hate it.  But I don't.  Part of the problem comes from growing up in Miami.    The national drink of the Florida Keys is the Rum Runner.  It's a cocktail that is pretty much impossible to find north of Miami.  But Fat Tuesday's has it.  Well, all Fat Tuesday's besides this one.  WTF.    I was surprised to see that they have a drink made with Pyrat rum.  And it was fine.  But it wasn't the Fat Tuesday's experience of my youth that I was hoping for.   Where did the Rum Runner go?  Well, the bartender explained that they had to take out a few machines to make room for additional bottles of booze.  Apparently someone had the bright idea that Fat Tuesdays should actually mix cocktails besides just pour frozen boozy slushies into plastic cups.    Whoever had that idea should be fired.  Boozy slushies in plastic cups is what this place is about.  And in the heat of a Tempe summer a Rum Runner would be just about perfect.  But they are gone because apparently some fool thought it would be a good idea to sell cosmos too.

You have to be crazy to stand over a mesquite fire in the Arizona heat flipping burgers.    But that craziness pays off in a remarkably charred patty, that has been licked with smoke and fire, after it has been cooked on a well seasoned grate.  It is one of those thin patties that one might expect to be brown all the way through.  But not here.  Not even after the patty has shrunk to over half of it's original size.    For what it's worth, this place reminds me of a dirtier desert version of Clown Alley in San Francisco.  Fries are crisp.  We got the chicken strips for the little one, and they were well seasoned, and came out literally still sizzling with oil.  I would certainly consider eating some of their other fried foods.  My only nit is that I do wish they had rings of raw onion, instead of the large chunks of onion pieces.  I LOVE raw onion on my burgers, and these were just an unfortunate shape.  Either smaller or larger would have done the trick.    On the plus side, I have to admit, I love a place that is so committed to cheap beer that the best things on tap are Budweiser and Michelob.  It was cold.  It was cheap.  It went great with my burger.  And naturally they sell it by the pitcher.

This place is strange in all the right ways.  It's strange how it's located on the ground floor of what looks like a Motel 6. It's strange that you can get an incredible and beautiful cappuccino in the middle of the desert. It's strange that they don't make flavored coffee and don't have an ounce of caramel on hand. It's strange they source all of their own green beans, roast them in house, and never in the French style. It's strange how the seem to actually have a lab a few doors down in the "motel". It's strange that even though I've only been once, I love this place and everything about it.  I am so happy that I made this one of my first stops during my visit to Tempe.  Now I can go every morning and try the rest of their offerings.  And that is strange.  Because in one visit they have won me over to the point where I am not even interested in trying the other coffee places in town.  If that doesn't deserve 5* I don't know what does.

Oh.  My.  God.  Yes.  You want lean meat?  F*ck you.  Don't clog up the line.    You want your meat nice and buttery with tender melting fat, that has been smoked and seasoned, sliced by hand, and delivered to you on a platter with a stack of rye bread?  Come.  Come fast.  Come often.  I was here twice in a three day trip to Montreal.  Get the large platter.  Get it half medium, half fatty.  Do it.  Live a little.  Get yourself a pickle and some cole slaw, the vinegar helps to cut the fat.  Get a black cherry soda, the bubbles and sugar help cut the fat and salt.    Just watch your waiters.  Mine was rude and terrible.  I was told by a Canadian friend, that I just received an authentic montreal experience.  But my waiter got everything wrong.  He brought me lean meat, and I wanted to stab him with a fork.  Luckily, he came back promptly with fatty meat.    But you can't fault a place with such an incredible product like Schwartz's Smoked Meat on the basis of bad service.  You can't even fault them for being in Canada.  You can be resentful we don't have them in NY.  But we have good things in NY too.  Just sadly no Schwartz's  N.B. Skip the cream soda... the house Canadian brand tastes like ass.  Really, it tastes more like bubble gum, but either way... it's just wrong.

Food should be eaten when it's fresh. That means most pizza's should be enjoyed at the shop, take out Chinese should be the exception rather than the rule, and restaurant meals should be completed at the table whenever possible.  Banh mi actually travel quite well, especially when packed properly. This place separates the vegetables from the meat, so that when you reheat the sandwich in the oven (350 F - for 10 to 15 minutes) they don't wilt.  The thing is that I live hundreds of miles away, so when my delivery of sandwiches came, they needed a bit of TLC to be brought back to life. If the decision is between fresh banh mi from upstate New York, or a slightly aged sandwich from Marche Hung Phat, I'm going with the imported sandwich every time.  What a delicious treat. I had the number one with ham, cha lua, and pate. But this has everything going on. Let me see if I can capture it. Crispy crust, tender crumb, meaty ham, funky pate, creamy dressing, crunchy cucumber, sweet pickles, hot pepper, warm bread, cool veggies, and all of it was in a gloriously harmonious balance.   To really get a true sense of the place, I have to get up to Montreal and try several of their freshly made sandwiches. But I'm such a fan, that I could not resist the chance to weigh in on their banh mi excellence.   Thanks to all of you who bring me delicious things from all over the world. I'm very lucky indeed.

I've never liked Montreal bagels.  I've always thought they tasted more like pretzels than bagels.    But, I was in Montreal, and my friend from the area, said this was the place to go.  So, I trekked out here.  In the rain.  Pushing a stroller.  With an overtired child in the seat.  First, I got here, and was disappointed there was no place to sit and enjoy the bagels I was going to buy.  The shop itself was great.  And watching the process was amazing.  But the place was small.  And not quite what I expected.    I bought a few bagels, took a bite out of one before leaving the store.  I was woefully unimpressed.    Then a local cabbie comes in.  He has left his cab double parked outside.  He asks for "two of whatever is hot".  Pays his money and is on his way.  I go back to the counter.  And I now ask for "two of whatever is hot".  And I have a bagel that changes my mind about what a bagel can be.  Holy sh*t those were good bagels.    Cabbies.  Say what you will about them... they know how to eat.    So screw the fancy flavors.  Seriously.  Get what just came out of the oven.  Eat it on the spot.  Then repeat.  Until you can't shove any more white flour down your gullet.  Are they the better bagel?  Honestly, I am still partial to the NY bagel on the whole.  But Fairmont has encouraged me to keep an open mind.

Cartel Coffee Lab is amazing. That should be capital A, Amazing!  I fell in love with this Phoenix coffee roaster and brewer years ago when visiting Tempe. But one of the things that made me fall in love with Cartel was its unflinching stance on the cappuccino. At their Tempe location, there was a sign that indicated no cappuccino could be ordered "to go".  And that stance makes total sense.   A cappuccino is a small drink. And it's all about texture. And it's all about immediacy. It wilts. It fades. You shouldn't wait to drink a cappuccino. And if you've crafted a mighty fine version of this drink, you don't want it to sit around for a moment before it's enjoyed, lest all that textured milk deflate, the volatile aromatics dissipate, and the sum of your efforts fall apart as time takes its inevitable toll.  Of course, it makes total sense that at an airport especially, people might be in a hurry and want to take their drinks in a paper cup to drink on the way to their gate.   I can't blame Cartel for not holding the line.  But I can ding them a star.   With love. Nothing but love.  For I feel it's an indictment against humanity that this Amazing coffee shop wasn't half as busy as Starbucks when we were passing through the Phoenix airport. It was nothing short of a gift from heaven that Cartel opened up an outpost in the airport, and I'm eternally grateful that I had another chance to have a drink from this great establishment.  Now I need to be on the lookout for flights with layovers in Phoenix. Because if I'm there again, I may just drop off a new sign demanding that no cappuccino will be made "to go".
