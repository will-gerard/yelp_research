Best seafood in Arizona hands down. I love this place just wish it was closer to home. The fish tacos are amazing.

Decent sushi for the price. Awesome happy hour, but I would only go when it is happier. Full price is very expensive.

Awesome place for dys. Amazing prices and the best customer service I have ever received. I go there quite often on my way home from work and have gotten to know the staff quite well. If you buy something that is broken they are very helpful and willing to help you fix it and find replacement parts.

Worst place ever spent almost $1000 on a dishwasher in January it's broken twice we have had 4 tech scheduled to come out and they've only showed up twice. We were told to come pick out a new dishwasher and they would deliver it and pick up the new one. So we did now they refuse to pick up or deliver. We've used this Samsung dishwasher maybe 5 times and I currently sits full of stagnant water because it won't drain and is coming up with errors.

Just an update dishwasher was replaced with a new one after much hassle and a complaint to the BBB. The replacement dishwasher is just has bad as the last one. The dishwasher was installed improperly with no ground. We have had a tech out twice now for the new dishwasher and we are scheduled for a third appointment. It has not worked since it was replaced.

Bought a couch and love seat from and was promised delivery between 4 and 6 pm. Called at 6:30 and was told the delivery was from between 10 and midnight (who has furniture delivered at midnight). Asked customer service to speak with a supervisor and was denied our request. We were told that the delivery personnel would call us before they arrive, because we made it clear we would have a sleeping young child. No phone call was received they knocked and rang the doorbell waking up our small child. At least they ended up giving us free delivery. I wasn't happy, but sadly to say it was still a better experience than we have had with Ashley Furniture.
