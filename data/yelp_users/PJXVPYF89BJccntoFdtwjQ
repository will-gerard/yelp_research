My friends and I visited Krua Thai for dinner after being told how great it is. I've been eating quite a bit of Thai lately, but that would never stop me from trying out a new place!  It's a small place, so you may have to wait a bit during peak hours. It also leads to the staff needing to flip tables a little quicker once you've finished eating, but I didn't have a problem with that. I ordered my usual, Shrimp Pad Thai, but this time went with the "Thai Spicy" level of heat. The waiter laughed and said, "Oh we had some hot spices this year, I almost died"...coming from a thai guy I was pretty nervous. It came out hot and spicy as expected. The thai spicy level is sneaky hot, meaning it's not hot right off the bat with the first bite but gradually goes from stinging your lips to "what the heck are you feeding me" over the course of the dish. By the time I was done, I had a nice sweat on my cheeks and on my forehead. Our waiter joked again and said, "oh you aren't sweating enough, here's some chili sauce for you". Funny guy!  Overall, very enjoyable food, great selection and good price. All of us were happy with the food we ordered. The only down side was it was a little small, and got a bit loud from all the people in the restaurant. This would not deter me from going back, and I'm sure we'll be there again soon. I'd recommend Krua Thai to anyone looking for great Thai food with a small party.

This place is seriously a hidden gem. If you haven't eaten here, you need to go there, like now. It's been in business for over 30 years from what I've been told.   The staff is incredibly friendly and they WILL remember you the next time you eat there. They treat my wife and I very well every time we are there. It's probably because we had our wedding rehearsal dinner there. That's how much we enjoy this place.   The food is always hot and very tasty. They give you hot tea, and fried wontons every time you eat there and are always very quick with their service. My recommendations are: Mongolian Beef, Sizzling Rice Soup (if you're in the mood for soup), Honey Walnut Shrimp, Happy Family, Shrimp Fried rice...I could go on and on, but they have so many good options.   If you're in the mood for Chinese and want a friendly and quiet place to eat, go to Dragon Palace!

Today was a day that I will long remember, and doubt I will ever experience again. This will be the day that I had the pleasure of using the greatest shopping cart in my history of retail shopping.   When I first wrapped my hands around the cart handles, I knew it was something special. Just the feeling of the plastic in my hands was superior to anything I had used before. Little did I know what more was in store for me.  The feeling of the wheels on the concrete was simply sublime. They rolled with ease as if they were touched by Jesus himself. The movement of the cart was just effortless and it felt as if I was pushing a cloud through the building materials aisle. I placed a large, heavy bucket of premixed thinset into it's carriage, and I could barely tell the difference. It was like I placed a bundle of balloons in the cart, not a heavy bucket.   This cart was perfectly balanced. It did not veer to the left or to the right like many-a lesser cart may trend. It only went exactly where it needed to go as if my satisfaction was it's guarantee.  After I checked out, I made my way to the cart corral and a small tear formed in the corner of my eye. I considered taking the cart home so that I my hand it down as an heirloom to my children, but I did not want to rob the world of the greatest cart ever fashioned from plastic and steel.   The 3 words that come to mind when thinking about this cart are: perfect, perfection, well-oiled, great and greatest of all time

A group of us went to Thai House for lunch on Sunday, and really enjoyed it. The restaurant was small, and quiet which is ok with me. Typically, when I go to a new Thai place I always order the same thing, Shrimp Pad Thai, extra spicy. Thai House gives you an option for how spicy you'd like your meal, which is pretty standard for Thai places. They give you an option of 0-5 for spiciness (Translation: Wimp - I was born in Thailand!). It was also reasonably priced, with most choices somewhere between $8 - $11.   I ordered the Pad Thai at a 4 spiciness this time, mainly because you never really know what constitutes a 5 until you've eaten there at least once. The food was tasty and had a decent amount of spice to it. I can usually handle pretty spicy food, and this was slightly less spicy then I was expecting. Next time I visit their, I'll go all in with the 5. Wish me luck! The only thing I didn't like is that they leave the tails on the shrimp. This seems to be a standard practice at most places so I'm guessing their is a reason for it, maybe someone can explain it to me? I just hate have to pick the tails off before eating, or removing them as I'm chewing.   Overall, it was a very nice dining experience. Good food and a great variety for others who don't like food as spicy as I do. My friend is on the wimp scale and they really enjoyed their meal, so don't be afraid to try it if you're a wimp too!

Visited Texas BBQ House for lunch after hearing reviews that it rivaled one of my favorite BBQ joints in Phoenix, so I wanted to check it out. Anything with Texas in the name has my intrigue when it comes to BBQ  First of all, you get $3 off for checking in to Yelp which is a huge plus in my book. Great move by the owner. The parking is a little sparse, but we managed to get a good spot with minimal line. They have a great selection of BBQ from both fatty and lean brisket, to their signature sandwich the Texas Po Boy. The prices were consistent with other BBQ joints.  I ordered the Texas Po Boy because it covered the main types of food you're looking for: brisket, pulled pork and sausage. This sandwich is huge and comes with plenty of meat. I'd suggest it if you're coming hungry and ready to eat. It was quite tasty for every bite. The down side for me was that the sausage tended to overpower the other meats, which makes sense due to the strength of sausage flavor as a whole. I also wish they had their own BBQ sauce selection for customers. I was not a fan of the BBQ sauce they put on the sandwich for you. I would have liked to add my own, and had options like you do at other places. If you're getting brisket, I would recommend getting the lean. My friend had the "moist" brisket and it had a little too much fat on it. That was coming from a guy who loves fatty brisket.  All in all, it was a good BBQ experience and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for good BBQ and not in the mood to stand in line for a long time. I would definitely return when in the area.

They need to rename this place Jasmine GOATyo....because it's definitely the greatest Asian buffet of all time in the Scottsdale area. If you want to eat yourself silly, this is your place. Also, it's in an old Claim Jumper building, and they basically kept the decor identical. It's amazing. If you dock it for that then you need to stop taking yourself so seriously.   I've been probably 10 times and I'm literally never disappointed. All you can eat sushi, prime rib, crab, shrimp, ribs, and other asian dishes like honey walnut shrimp, teriyaki chicken, etc. All for a pretty decent price ($23 for dinner at the time of this writing). Anyone rating it poorly needs to understand "IT'S A BUFFET PEOPLE", Emeril isn't back there bamming up pots and pans. It's a buffet, not Maestro's make your expectations accordingly.   You want to spend $40 on sushi, go for it. Or you can go here, pay less, and get the same kinds of sushi with all the other aforementioned items. Throw in that they always have coupons that you can use, and you have a 5 star rating from me!

I've been to this location several times, but our latest experience was very poor.   First of all, I'm baffled how people can desire to come to such a place. Mediterranean food needs to stay overseas where it belongs. However, everyone has the freedom to choose what they want, so I'd never stand in your way. But this is rabbit food IMO!  With that out of the way, I appreciate the healthy options that Pita jungle offers people (the only reason I gave it 2 stars). There is obviously a market for this type of place and they've managed to handle it pretty well. Enough carrying on. We went there for our friends birthday, had a party of 12 (they were not busy by any stretch of the word). Once we were seated it took about 10 minutes to get our order in, and then we waited an hour+ for the food to come out, and several of the dishes were missing items. I get that we had a larger than standard party, but kitchens HAVE to be able to handle it especially while not being busy. The waitress did what she could, but the overall experience was pretty poor, hence the 2 stars.   If I'm forced to eat at a Pita Jungle again, I hope it'll be at a different location.

I mean, does this place need another 5 star review? I don't care, I'm doing it anyways.  If you want Texas Style BBQ, this is one of the ONLY places you're going to find it in Phoenix. The brisket is award winning (literally), and all the other items are incredible. I smoke my own BBQ at home, so I know the effort it takes to get to such a high quality. This is the first place that I can say outdoes what I can do at home. Their customer service is outstanding. They are very friendly, and give a quick sample before you order. The pit master will walk the line and talk to people, especially regulars. He's super friendly, and so is his dad who directs traffic out in the parking lot. The only drawback is the line you have to wait in. But, how can you dock a place for having a long line because of how damn good it is? You can't, I'll wait in the line 2 hours if I have to, it's worth it to me. I really hope they decide to expand, but I know they don't have aspirations to become a huge restaurant, which I respect.  Go get in line for Little Miss, you won't be sorry you did.

Came here for lunch with a friend yesterday. This was my second time eating at Paquime. It's a great little spot to get a good Mexican lunch for a very reasonable price.  I ordered their Paquime torta with pork sirloin, avocado, and jalepeno. It was a decent sandwich, but was kind of small. But it was $6, which is very hard to beat elsewhere. The staff was friendly and helpful with our questions.  The best part for me was the massive sugar cookie they have. It's huge and delicious and to top it off, it was $0.59 (I think). Get outta here! I'll take 12 please!   This is a once every few months kind of place for me. But I enjoy it every time.

I've visited Banh Mi on several occasions with my co-workers, and I'm never disappointed. The food usually comes out quickly, and is fresh. I like that I can leave feeling full but I don't feel like I'll be going into a food coma later in the day. It's a great spot to grab lunch in the middle of the work day.   I have gotten 2 of the sandwiches and have been getting the salad noodle bowl lately. Both choices are very good. I would recommend anyone who has an open mind to visit Banh Mi. Most of their dishes have a lot of vegetables, and other ingredients in them. If you don't like food that is non-traditional, you probably shouldn't be eating at any vietnamese place anyway. I only wish they served Pho here. Which they make clear with the No Pho sign at the register.   All in all, good food, good service, fairly well priced.

I'll start by listing the good things. The head chef was very friendly and made sure to walk around and greet customers. I very much appreciate his effort doing this, customer service is always important. It wasn't very busy so we were able to get right in, ordered, and seated. That's unfortunately where the good ends.   Unfortunately, the food was just mediocre and it was priced too high for the quality of food. The brisket was dry, tough and lacked the good smokey flavor that you expect at a place called a "smokehouse". The food cooled very quickly and dried out once it was on the plate . I had to add BBQ sauce to the brisket which is a total no-no, and makes me cry. I spent $16 and really regretted it. I'm not sure what they're process is but it seems like they cook it into "the stall" and then take it out of the oven. It didn't seem like they pushed it to the right internal temperature for it to come out tender. Good BBQ takes time, and this brisket tasted and felt rushed.  All in all, if you have to add BBQ sauce and use a knife to cut brisket, it's wrong. But the guy running it was friendly, so it gets 2 stars.
