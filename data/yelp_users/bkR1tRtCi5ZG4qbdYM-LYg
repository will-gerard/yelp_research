Costco, I love you.  My family and I have been going to this Costco since it was "Price Club" --- whoa, that's a long time. At least 15 years.   The service here is consistently wonderful-- and what is even more amazing is that there are employees who are still there after all of this time. That tells you something.  Costco is the best pharmacy around. So much cheaper than other pharmacies. They get my vote every time.  But today, I am giving a specific shout out to the two wireless kiosk phone guys. I had a couple of questions about my contract, which they answered. My phone had started to die while I talkd to them, and I asked if they had an extra charger that I could borrow while we spoke. Sure enough, they plugged it in, answered my questions and gave me some extra information. A+ for customer service on that one. My phone lasted just long enough to get me home. When I need an upgrade for my phone, I will DEFINITELY be coming back to visit them.  PS: The Kirkland brand cranberry and macadamia nut cereal is delightful.

Aloha Kitchen has yet to disappoint. My coworker introduced this to me for lunch, and oh my gosh, I couldn't be happier.   The serving sizes are GIGANTIC! He and I often split the Mix #3 (I think) with teriyaki and katsu chicken. This is accompanied by two huge scoops of rice, and your choice of side (I always go with macaroni salad). To top it off, you get a slice of fruit. Definitely some bang for your buck happening here.  The other day, we tasted the pink guava cake, and it was quite tasty. There is a gelatin-type layer on the top, which is tricky, as I expected it to be more like marzipan. However, this is not a bad thing, Definitely a fun treat (and bonus, it's pretty).  Thanks Aloha for helping me break out of the Subway/Jimmy John's lunch rut I had been stuck in! I'll be back soon.

Crackers & Co quickly became my boyfriend and I's go to Saturday morning/afternoon breakfast/brunch spot. We have been there at least six, if not seven times, and they have yet to disappoint.   Yelp won't let me type all of the wonderful things that I feel about Crackers, so I am going to make a quick reference list:  1. The California Eggs Benedict (without tomato) will change your life. I have gotten this every time I have been to Crackers. 2. The blintzes that you eat at Crackers will be the best you have ever tasted. I always want to order 15 to go. 3. I have never had to wait for longer than 5 minutes at Crackers. Even though they get super busy, they are incredibly efficient and make sure you don't have to wait forever. 4. The food comes out fast and hot every time we have ordered it. Don't know how they do it, but they do. 5. I have also tasted the steak eggs benedict (yummo), the New Princess (yummo), the apple pie french toast (not my favorite, but still yummo), and the mexican skillet (HOLY YUMMO).  Seriously. The boyfriend and I adore this place and are continuously pleased when we go there. Love supporting this local chain.  The only "bad" thing I could say about them is that they have such an extensive menu! I don't know if I will ever be able to try one of everything! Heeheehee! :)

I have been to a great many Ross store-- and I can safely say that this one is my favorite. Even when it is busy, it is still manageable, unlike some of the others.   I am also consistently pleased with their selection. Now, I often go in there without much of a purpose, just to see what's there-- but I recently found ALL, that's right, all of my Christmas gifts. Perhaps I went in on a lucky day, but I can't think of a time when I didn't walk out of there with at least something.  I was sorry to read the previous review, because I have had such a consistently good time at this store. As for the store having a security guard, the one who works most of the time is a kick in the pants. He'll chat with you if given the opportunity. Also, every Ross has at least one, if not two, security guards working while the store is open.   I hope more of you are encouraged to visit now that you know what a great time I have had there. It's one of the smaller Ross stores that I have been in, but it certainly packs a punch. Happy bargaining!

Over the past two months, I have seen Dr. Heiland twice and I am SO glad that I did.  Back Story: I had been insanely ill for two weeks with what I thought was a cold. After realizing that my throat was oddly swollen on one side, I went to the Walgreens clinic and was diagnosed with a "mystery infection". 10 days of antibiotics later, the infection hadn't gone away. I was recommended to Valley ENT by a friend and the first time I called, I spoke with Lauren.  Lauren was incredibly pleasant and encouraging during this first call. My insurance had lapsed after I was laid off, and I was stuck needing a doctor with no insurance. Lauren encouraged me to have COBRA reinstate my insurance, but told me that in the mean time, the first office visit would be $250 (which covered all procedures done in office). Of course, that sounded steep, so I said I would think about it.  That night, my fever spiked to 102-- the next day, I called Lauren back, begging for an appointment. The doctor who I was originally referred to (whose name I can't remember) was unavailable, but Lauren said she could get me in THAT DAY with Dr. Heiland. I happily took the appointment.  First Appointment: Sept 4th  My boyfriend drove me to the Valley ENT office for my 3 o'clock appointment. We ended up waiting for a full hour before I was seen. Of course, I was unhappy (and sick) about this, but I often expect to wait in doctor's offices. During our wait, we checked out the massive fish tank. The office staff offered us bottles of water and magazines and apologized for the wait.  I was called back and the medical assistant (I think) escorted me into the exam room. She was nice, took my temperature and got some details from me. Dr. Heiland came in shortly thereafter and all I can say is wow.   Let me list out the reasons I was so impressed: 1. Dr. Heiland sat down, away from the computer, with a pen and pad of paper. He said that he had read over my chart, but wanted me to describe to him what had been going on. I'm a SUPER detailed person, so I rattled off the whole story. Dr. Heiland scrawled notes the whole time, asked me more detailed questions, and even included my boyfriend in the conversation. His full attention given to me the whole time. Awesome. He even had a sense of humor, which is always welcome. 1a. When Dr. Heiland had to examine me, he informed me that I had nice ears and teeth and that my nasal cavity curved to the left. This entire exchange was really fun/funny-- and totally nerdy. Two thumbs up. 2. Dr. Heiland was really knowledgeable about all things ear-nose-and throat (and it was clear). He explained that I had an infected lymph node, why it was making me feel the way it was, what we would do if it got better, and what we would do if it didn't. 3. At no point during our encounter was I lost in "doctor jargon". If anything was unclear, and either my boyfriend or myself asked, Dr. Heiland would explain more in detail. Not at all condescending, but completely helpful. 4. When giving me another 3 week dose of antibiotics, Dr. Heiland recommended a brand of probiotic pills and Activia yogurt to help my system. He even prescribed an anti-fungal in advance, in case it became an issue. This made me feel like he was really considering my whole body/looking at the big picture. 5. I got all of this great service DESPITE my not having insurance. He also encouraged me to get COBRA, as if we needed to remove the lymph node, it would be expensive-- but he didn't make me feel bad about not having insurance. Kind and supportive all around.  Our appointment lasted at least an hour, if not more. The entire staff stayed after the office had closed, because we were the last patients to leave. They didn't rush us out, everyone was so nice. We were blown away.  Initially, I deducted 1 star from my review for the hour wait, but when I realized how much time and attention Dr. Heiland dedicated to each patient, I added the star back, because no one likes being rushed, and it is important to really HEAR your patients.  Second Appointment: October 4th @ 2. My infection had resolved itself, thank goodness! I went in for a follow up appointment just to verify. My appointment was at 2, but again, we didn't see Dr. Heiland until later (shrug). Once we did, Dr. Heiland was really nice and funny, as usual. The visit/exam was only about 10 minutes. He did explain precautions/what to do in the future, but it was an in and out kind of office experience.  Perhaps the best part was that when my boyfriend and I left the exam room, the two medical assistants AND the office staff stood up and shouted "Yay!" and clapped for my lack of infection. It was seriously adorable.   I maintain 5 stars for this entire situation, despite the tardiness. I really valued being listened to and being treated like a whole person. I think it's great that Dr Heiland's whole office team are so nice. I like EVEN MORE that he treated my infection and it went away. Thanks Valley ENT!

I'm giving this Walgreen's 5 stars for customer service. I went in, hoping to buy some laundry soap which on the Walgreens website was buy 1, get 2 free (ridiculously good deal!)  One of the associates informed me that it wasn't on sale in the store and that the website/store sales are often different. Discouraged, I was about to leave when the employee encouraged me to speak with her manager. I certainly didn't think that this was necessary, but the employee buzzed her manager over anyway.  The manager was really understanding and offered to honor the website sale for me. Oh my gosh, I was so pleasantly stunned. I had planned on buying like 6 bottles of laundry soap, but only bought 3 since the manager was so kind.  Thanks for going above and beyond, ladies. I will definitely return to this Walgreen's!

My boyfriend and I have become regulars at this place because of how fun it is. It's casual, small, and the food is really tasty. I suggest the shrimp torta or the chicken tacos with rice and beans. Mmm-mmm. I'm considering going there now that I am writing this review!  It is a small place, so it may be ideal for groups of 4 or 5 or less.   Don't be intimidated by the neighborhood/what it looks like outside, I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun at Los Picos! Happy eating!

I am going to start calling this "Disney Walgreens". It's huge, well lit, has a mini grocery section, and is always clean.   I went into the Take Care Health Care Clinic this morning-- no appointment, and had to wait for about a half an hour, which was fine, considering that I was able to sign in and then meander around the gigantic store for the majority of the time that I spent there.  Barbara (Barb) was the RN who helped me with what I thought was an ear infection. She did the normal doctor thing, and then wrote me a prescription. She was very nice and funny. She was also especially interested in the swelling that I had in my throat because it wasn't any of the "usuals". She recommended that I take an antibiotic for 72 hours, and if the swelling had not gone down, to go to an Urgent Care or the ER. I really appreciated that she took the time to thoroughly check me out and that she didn't make up a fake diagnosis, and came right out and said that she wasn't exactly sure what it was. Really appreciate the honesty.  Let's cross our fingers and hope it is just some obscure infection and that penicillin will get it gone.  Overall, very pleasant experience. Also, took my Aetna insurance. Woo!

This review is specifically for the Walgreen's website/photo department.  As part of a Christmas gift, I needed to print 6 photos. Initially, I had planned on going to CVS because I needed to go there anyway. After experiencing their website,I quickly changed my mind. First strike: the CVS website was clunky and awkward to use. Second strike: my six photos wouldn't be ready for three to four hours. Third strike: CVS was going to charge me and extra $1.50 because my order was under $5. Say whaaaaa?  I quickly opted to check out Walgreen's, and holy cow, am I glad! The website was flawless. The photos were ready in less than an hour. For six photos, it was going to cost me less than $1.50. But, I searched and found a promo code for 40% off-- and do you know what Yelp? IT WORKED! I paid a grand total of 78 cents today. It was magical.  I am now trying to figure out what other photos I can print. Yay Walgreens!

Attention Golden Corral AND the two GC employees that we dealt with at this location -- the one star that I am forced to leave for my experience here is too good for you. I would leave you a -10 stars if it were possible I am down-right horrified by the events that have taken place in the past two hours. Forcing myself to avoid vulgar language in this review is almost too much.  To get right to the point, tonight my boyfriend and I went to this location for dinner (just past 7:00). We paid about $30 for the meal (yikes) and then did the whole select-your-food-buffet thing. Within about 10 minutes of sitting down with our first plates of food, we discovered that the piece of chicken on our plate was raw inside. My boyfriend had eaten a bite and when it didn't taste right, he went in for a closer look. Indeed, despite how it looked on the outside, it was still pink and gooshy on the inside. Ewwwwwwww.  We immediately stopped eating and brought this to the attention of our waitress (Kim). The response that we got? "Eh, that happens sometimes. I'll pass it along" Literally, this was the response.  Uh....I'm sorry, what?  We thought maybe she was having a rough evening/ didn't understand the severity of the situation, so we spoke with the manager (Cathy), who said "Eh, we'll have them pull that pan." When we waited for more of a response, she simply smiled at us and then walked away. ZERO concern shown for the fact that we had already CONSUMED some of this raw chicken. Absolutely infuriated, we couldn't bring ourselves to eat much more and we left.  Halfway home, both of our stomachs did flip flops, and upon returning to the house, what should happen? You guessed it. Violently sick to our stomachs. So, now, I feel awful AND had to pay for it? Not acceptable.  About a half an hour ago, I made the mistake of calling Golden Corral to address this issue. I asked to speak with the manager, and, Lucky me, Cathy again. When I told her what was going on and asked for a refund she cut me off and rudely snapped "Well, you know we can't do that." I responded that this was unacceptable (in an effort to give her a second chance). Nope. Cathy then says that no refund is possible, and they "take classes on this sort of thing, and it is impossible to get a food-borne illness within an hour." She then recommended that they only thing that they can do is encourage us to go to a doctor if we're not feeling well.   I couldn't help myself Yelpers, I laughed. This is one of the most ABSURDLY HORRIBLE customer service interactions I have ever had. And...it gets worse... Cathy then goes on to tell me that she recalls dealing with my boyfriend at I, and that our complaint had nothing to do with the food, it had to do with a dirty spoon.  Nope. Wrong again. That complaint was two tables over from us. We definitely had an issue with the raw chicken, not the spoon. When I tried to explain this, Cathy interrupted me again. I finally said that I would call their corporate office, and she snottily got off the phone.   Yelpers, I am absolutely sickened by this entire situation. Run, don't walk, as far away as you can from this place. If not for the potential food poisoning, then from the genuinely rude customer service and sub-par dining experience.  Hopefully, my concerns will be more appropriately addressed this week when I reach out to the corporate office.

Within the past two weeks, my boyfriend and I have been to this Petsmart nearly every day and have interacted with almost all of the employees (as we have been in at all times of the day).  Honestly, we didn't go into Petsmart with particularly high hopes. To be clear, the lack of expectations is not a reflection on this store or on Petsmart as a general whole, but Petsmart isn't a place that I go looking to be pampered.  That being said, I have to give a shout out to this store's group of employees (especially the two girls in the fish department) who have been overwhelmingly helpful on each of our visits. The two fish tank specialists have started to recognize us, and always greet us by saying "You're back!"  Here is a list of other things that have pleasantly surprised me about this Petsmart (and you know how I love lists): 1. These Petsmart employees always make themselves available. Unlike other pet stores, where the majority of your time is spent milling around looking for someone to help you, in this Petsmart enough employees work each shift so that if you need attention, you will get it. 2. This particular Petsmart is very, very clean. I have yet to see a mess of any sort. They also have a nice cleaning regiment for their fish tanks, which always look nice anyway. 3. When we decided to invest in a 10 gallon tank starter kit, I misplaced the original receipt. I was able to go back into the store, and because i had used my Petsmart Perks card (or whatever they call it), the store manager was able to print out a duplicate receipt, even though the transaction was from three to four days prior. Thumbs up! 4. We bought two african dwarf frogs and a ghost shrimp from Petsmart, who are  happy and healthy since we brought them home and set up the tank. 5. The prices here on MOST of the items we were looking for were better than the competition.  Overall, I have been very, very pleased with the selection at Petsmart, and will be returning today for a few more things. I'm rating 4 out of 5 stars because some of the items can be found cheaper at Petco (which is the same distance from my home as Petsmart) and that the "pet guarantee" for fish is only 14 days at Petsmart. It is a whopping 30 days at Petco.   Please note, that both of these "gripes" have nothing to do with the employees, who are a delight.

My boyfriend and I came here on a Sunday afternoon (around 3), hoping for a quiet lunch/dinner and were not disappointed! There was hardly anyone else in the restaurant, so we got to sit with a great view of the aquarium.   Our server was really nice, on top of things, and new when to give us space/when to check on us. I was really impressed.  The loaf of bread that they bring you before you order is INCREDIBLE! Would have ordered a wheelbarrow full to take home! It's freshly baked and dusted with sugar. Delicious. One loaf? Not enough! :)  The food didn't blow me away, but it was still tasty. We were pleasantly surprised by the alligator appetizer. It was kind of salty, but whatever the sauce was on top (green, and a little sweet/tangy) I wouldn't have minded taking a bucket of it home.   I had the coconut shrimp and was happy with the taste/size of the shrimp. I wasn't as impressed with the sauce that accompanied them, so I just happily ate the shrimp without it.   My boyfriend ordered the fish and chips and I was AMAZED at the size of the cod strips, gigantic. He chowed down but still had to take a lot of it home (he later told me that it made a great sandwich the next day).   4 stars because I would definitely consider myself a fan of the experience and will be back!

Let me just say: WOW!!! How have I only just now been to this place? If you love Greek food, look no further.  We stopped in today for a quick bite to eat and were not disappointed. You know how I love lists, so here is a list of the things that we loved about this place: 1. Easily the best gyro meat we have ever had. Flavorful. Tender. The ideal texture. Just. Muah! *kissing motion* 2. The fries/salad were also awesome. Taaaaasty sides. 3. Generous portions. Holy cow, the gyros were gyro-normous! I almost had to use a fork! 4. The tzaztiki (I am butchering the spelling of that word) is out of this world. It, like the meat, has incredible flavor and texture-- not too much dill flavor/very creamy/not too thin. I'll take a bucket to-go, please. 5. There are  red and green bell peppers on the Gyro Supreme. YUM!  6. Cheap. Cheap. Cheap. The prices at the place are ridiculous (in a good way), considering the caliber of the food you receive. We paid less than $20 for two of us. Can't go wrong with prices like that. 7. Family owned/local business. We were able to meet the owner (George). Loved that! 8. The decor. This tiny little hole in the wall place has really adorable styling inside.  9. Free drink when you check in on Yelp. 10. Only 5 minutes from the house.  All in all, this discovery was a complete win. While we were there, Rob (the boyfriend) actually used the word "out-%$@king-standing!". Seriously. That good.  We will be back ASAP! Thank you, George!

Went here this evening and had the crispy shrimp tacos, and all I can say is OM NOM NOM! Also, the beans are delicious, but the rice is so out of this world, that next time, I may double up on the rice. Also, do yourself a favor and order the guacamole to start with (though they do top it with tomatoes, which makes me sad, but is totally a personal thing).   Another couple we went with got the carnitas burrito and loved it as well.  To top it all off, our waitress (though now I have forgotten her name, of course) was absolutely delightful.   The sinks in the bathroom are also really cool, if any of you are into that :)

Ah, House Doctor Exterminating-- thank you for solving my pest control woes. After a lengthy search for an exterminator with a good attitude, I found House Doctor Exterminating and couldn't be more pleased.   Here is my situation: I live in a town home and learned that our next door neighbors have bed bugs (nooooooooooo!!!!). We share a wall with these neighbors, so naturally, my boyfriend and I tore our place apart looking for any evidence of bed bugs. Good news! We don't have them, so we wanted to call a professional to spray to prevent any infestation issue (even though I had already spread diatomaceous earth around our baseboards, in our electrical outlets, and behind our light switches).  My experience with House Doctors started with a very pleasant phone call with Josh, whose ability to directly answer my questions and reassure me about the bed bug issue really sold me on this business. I spoke with Josh on Friday, and they were booked until Monday. I was looking for someone sooner than that, but after a series of discouraging calls with other pest control businesses-- I happily called House Doctors back for a Monday appointment.  When I asked Josh what the price range would be, he asked me about the size of my home and a yard, and happily gave me a "ball park" idea of what the price would be, explaining that the price (of course) specifically depends on the size of my home/what they find in the home/ how much chemical and how much time was required to complete the job. And...guess what else, Yelpers? No contracts or commitments or monthly services. Only want one spray? Then, one spray you will get!  I mentioned in our conversation that I appreciated Josh's willingness to discuss cost with me, because I had been laid off and was concerned about money. Josh went the EXTRA MILE and asked me what price I could afford. I told him and he said he could make it happen-- and you know what? He did! I was completely taken off guard by this and couldn't have been more pleased. I genuinely wanted to cry with joy.  I set up an appointment for Monday (which was today). I asked Josh if House Doctors did email confirmations so I could let my landlord know. He explained that they didn't usually, but took my email address down, and not five minutes after we got off the phone, I had an email confirming the appointment.   I got a call this morning from Josh, alerting me that the technician would be late, and he apologized. Fortunately, the change in schedule actually worked better for us, as it gave us a chance to finish vacuuming and pulling furniture away from the walls. I mostly really appreciated the advanced notice.   Tony was the technician who serviced our home today. When he arrived, he was incredibly apologetic for being late. We explained that it wasn't an issue and toured him around our place for the inspection and spray. AWESOME NEWS, Yelp! Tony confirmed that we do not have bed bugs!!! Tony was very reassuring about the issue and both my boyfriend and I appreciated his laid back sense of humor. We couldn't have been more pleased with him. Tony was happy to spray any of the places that I pointed out on our tour. He was also very thorough and efficient. I was expecting this to take at least an hour, and it was nowhere near that! Fast and friendly service?! What could be better?  From beginning to end, my interaction with House Doctor Exterminating was an awesome experience. 5 stars for being efficient and to the point, both on the phone and in my home. I will be calling them next month for another preventative spray and would highly recommend them to anyone who is in the market.  Thanks, House Doctors!!!

Well, The Turf certainly was a fun, little pub. I had never heard of it, but my boyfriend's band played there last Friday, so I stopped by.  It has a nice atmosphere, with a variety of seating areas. I really appreciated that I was able to grab a table just as I walked in.  You can see the stage from almost every seat in the place, and the sound carries quite well. I think I can speak for myself and for the guys in the band when I say that we look forward to returning to The Turf!  Oh! And the prices were quite reasonable too-- I ordered a drink and an appetizer, and I think my bill was only about $12! And-- I discovered that they have a breakfast menu. Gonna see if I can get them to make me a waffle next time I am there drinking! ;-) (Just kidding!.... or am I?!)

If it was financially possible for me to eat at Thai Basil four times a week, I would, without a doubt.  I will admit that I am not very well versed in Thai food, so I can't comment on whether or not this is authentic. What I can comment on, however, is that it is FREAKIN' DELICIOUS.   I have been to three of the Thai Basil Locations: The one on University (next to Tops Liquor), this one (next to McDonald's on Rural), and the one on Baseline (on the south side of the street). The food has been consistently delicious at all three. The employees are always, always, always friendly. I haven't received anything less than excellent service.  Most recently, we tried the cheese/shrimp egg roll appetizer things (I honestly can't tell you what it was called) -- but holy tastiness, Batman! My boyfriend and I were both really glad that we ordered this.  The Chai Green tea is excellent too. Really refreshing, unsweetened, lots of flavor. Mmm mm mm.  But for me, this place is ALL ABOUT the curry. If you try the red curry (mild for me) or the massman (aka: "sweet nut" -- also mild) curry, you will not be disappointed. The red curry comes with your choice of meat/tofu (we always spring for the mixed seafood: scallops, shrimp, calamari) and has a variety of veggies in it too. Yummo.  The massman curry comes with meat/tofu, carrots, potato, and onion slices. The flavor is downright incredible. I don't think I could choose a favorite between the red curry and the massaman curry, but I think I crave the massman curry more (if that makes any sense).  The lunch portions are a nice size, maybe on the small size for some people, but they are perfect for me. At dinner, I always have to get a to go box.  I do recommend ordering dinner for pick up from Thai Basil. The curry comes in this GIGANTIC plastic container, and you get a nice side of rice. And, bonus, the curry container is reusable and can be heated in the microwave. I am beginning to have a stockpile of them.  All in all, Thai Basil is a win. I highly recommend it and cannot wait to go back.

I went to Wash N Wear Laundromat for the first time three months ago, and have been meaning to leave a review since. My mom and I were on a mission for a nice, cheap laundromat, and Ginny's Wash House wasn't going to cut it.  Based on the reviews of this place, we stopped in, and were really impressed. We were immediately greeted by the staff, and when we spoke with the owner (I am almost positive his name is Jason...but maybe it is James. Shoot, I'm not sure. I'm sorry!), he was insanely helpful. We had a several blankets/comforters to wash, and Jason helped us pick the best sized washers for the each of them.  Wash N Wear has several different sized washing machines, and a huge number of dryers, so I was glad to have been a recipient of the tour. I may have been overwhelmed, otherwise.  The landromat seemed very clean, even though the owner apologized for it being "dirty" since they were doing some renovations. Not sure what dirt he was talking about, because we were pleased.   The temperature was pleasantly surprising, as well. I hadn't considered it until my mom pointed it out-- what with so many machines, you'd think this place would have been stuffy. Not the case at all, there was nice air movement, and it was not too hot/cold. It pleased the Goldie Locks in me. (ha!)  When all was said and done, we spent just over $8.00 at Wash N Wear. And holy cow, what a deal! If we had taken the comforters to the dry cleaners, it would easily have been over $60.  No issues here, from beginning to end. A+ for convenience, cleanliness, friendly staff, and nice temperature.   Next time I need a laundromat, this will definitely be the one I go to.  Thanks Wash N Wear!

This place is consistently delicious and the owner and his employees are incredibly nice. When the weather is nice, you can find Skogun (spelling?), the owner's dog, outside, waiting to greet you.  Highly recommended based on taste and atmosphere, and love even more that it is a locally owned business.

Still the best yogurt place I have been to EVER. Delicious and curious flavors, fun environment and music, and this place is always spotless.   Do yourself a favor and try the Nutella and/or Blood Orange flavors. Oh my gosh, to die for.  Also bonus points that Aloha Yogurt has a recycle receptacle for the bowls and spoons. Bravo!

We've been going to this Petco for the past couple of years, because it's closest to our house. A constant and ongoing gripe with this location, while this seems to be an average pet store, in terms of stock and available products, is that it's nearly impossible to locate an employee, even when you're trying to check out. Every visit to this place ultimately leads us to milling around, trying to find an someone to help with whatever we need. The ones that we do find are averagely helpful, nothing to write home about, but none have been rude.   However, and this part of the review may not apply to most of you, but ATTENTION FISH LOVERS: confirmed case of camallanus worms in a fish that we just bought from this location. Due to the highly contagious nature of this parasite, I wanted to report on this immediately. Avoid this fish section, or be prepared to do a preventative deworming and quarantine of any new fish for 6 to 12 weeks.   Devastating. Will not return to this location to purchase any fish, for fear of infecting the rest of our tank.

After speaking with Jason, I can safely say that if I ever have an issue with scorpions, I will be giving him a call.  I called Jason hoping that he would be able to help me prevent a bed bug infestation (my neighbors have them and we share a wall, eeeek!). He informed me that he doesn't treat bed bugs, but still listened to my problem and offered me some valuable information.  Thanks for taking the time to speak with me, Jason! A+ for customer service!

Bosa has become my new guilty pleasure. I have to make it stop before someone hast to crane me out of my apartment.  The glazed buttermilk donuts are easily my favorite. They look like tiny loaves of bread. They're really dense, and sweet on the outside, with a more tame, cakelike interior. Yummy.  And, c'mon, 24 hour drive though? That's dangerous. You can also get a bag of day old donuts inside for some insanely discounted price. I have yet to try this for fear that I will eat all of the donuts in one sitting.  The employees at this place are always friendly too. On more than one occasion, we will find that they have given us a free donut or two. Yummy!

I was quite pleased when I visited Quick N Clean today. I opted for the $6 wash-- though now I can't quite remember what was included in said wash. I felt like it could have been a little bit more thorough in the rinse/dry section, as there was a trail of dirt coming off the back of my car.  HOWEVER-- be not dissuaded by the dirt on my bumper (as I wiped it off, and the rest of the car looked great) because the vacuums at this place? OH MY GOSH! I have never been to this kind of car wash and experienced such suction. They were also an ideal shape for getting into the tight spaces underneath my seats.   Word to the wise: when you go to remove the hoses from their little canisters, pull with force. I stood there for a couple of moments as I attempted to gingerly remove it, and thought the hose was stuck. I soon realized that I looked like an idiot, and just gave the vacuum a tug, and it came right out.   Overall, I definitely say thumbs up. I had been hoping for a little rag to wipe out the interior, but am not sure if the rag was part of one of the other packages, so I will investigate again, and let you know.

Alright Wash Wizards,   Gotta give you 5 Stars. Didn't realize that you closed at 7 when I spontaneously decided to get a car wash, so when I was "that person" who showed up at 7 on the dot, you could have turned me away. But you didn't for myself, or the car behind me. THANK YOU!   I was thinking this was one of those 3 dollar drive thru, drive away type situations, but, fellow Yelpers--it's not that simple. There are PEOPLE (not crazy brushes and rollers) that wipe down your car while it's in neutral, rolling through the wash area. SAY WHAT?! So, my initial lack of enthusiasm with $8 as the cheapest wash was instantly quashed when I saw the wizards work their magic.   Drove through, had my car wiped down while it was sprayed with water, then drove out, where they hand toweled my car. ALSO! They recycle all of their water-- so as if I wasn't sold already.  Obviously, as it was basically dark when I left, I haven't been able to fully appreciate it in the sunlight, but boy was it shiny when I left.  ALL FOR $8??!?!?! All I have to say is "What sorcery is this?!" my boyfriend and I were both so impressed that he's planning on bringing his truck back later in the week. New favorite car wash? Methinks yes.  Thanks again, wizards. I was really impressed with this entire experience.

Over the past two months, I have seen Dr. Heiland twice and I am SO glad that I did.  Back Story: I had been insanely ill for two weeks with what I thought was a cold. After realizing that my throat was oddly swollen on one side, I went to the Walgreens clinic and was diagnosed with a "mystery infection". 10 days of antibiotics later, the infection hadn't gone away. I was recommended to Valley ENT by a friend and the first time I called, I spoke with Lauren.  Lauren was incredibly pleasant and encouraging during this first call. My insurance had lapsed after I was laid off, and I was stuck needing a doctor with no insurance. Lauren encouraged me to have COBRA reinstate my insurance, but told me that in the mean time, the first office visit would be $250 (which covered all procedures done in office). Of course, that sounded steep, so I said I would think about it.  That night, my fever spiked to 102-- the next day, I called Lauren back, begging for an appointment. The doctor who I was originally referred to (whose name I can't remember) was unavailable, but Lauren said she could get me in THAT DAY with Dr. Heiland. I happily took the appointment.  First Appointment: Sept 4th  My boyfriend drove me to the office for my 3 o'clock appointment. We ended up waiting for a full hour before I was seen. Of course, I was unhappy (and sick) about this, but I often expect to wait in doctor's offices. During our wait, we checked out the massive fish tank. The office staff offered us bottles of water and magazines and apologized for the wait.  I was called back and the medical assistant (I think) escorted me into the exam room. She was nice, took my temperature and got some details from me. Dr. Heiland came in shortly thereafter and all I can say is wow.   Let me list out the reasons I was so impressed: 1. Dr. Heiland sat down, away from the computer, with a pen and pad of paper. He said that he had read over my chart, but wanted me to describe to him what had been going on. I'm a SUPER detailed person, so I rattled off the whole story. Dr. Heiland scrawled notes the whole time, asked me more detailed questions, and even included my boyfriend in the conversation. His full attention given to me the whole time. Awesome. He even had a sense of humor, which is always welcome. 1a. When Dr. Heiland had to examine me, he informed me that I had nice ears and teeth and that my nasal cavity curved to the left. This entire exchange was really fun/funny-- and totally nerdy. Two thumbs up. 2. Dr. Heiland was really knowledgeable about all things ear-nose-and throat (and it was clear). He explained that I had an infected lymph node, why it was making me feel the way it was, what we would do if it got better, and what we would do if it didn't. 3. At no point during our encounter was I lost in "doctor jargon". If anything was unclear, and either my boyfriend or myself asked, Dr. Heiland would explain more in detail. Not at all condescending, but completely helpful. 4. When giving me another 3 week dose of antibiotics, Dr. Heiland recommended a brand of probiotic pills and Activia yogurt to help my system. He even prescribed an anti-fungal in advance, in case it became an issue. This made me feel like he was really considering my whole body/looking at the big picture. 5. I got all of this great service DESPITE my not having insurance. He also encouraged me to get COBRA, as if we needed to remove the lymph node, it would be expensive-- but he didn't make me feel bad about not having insurance. Kind and supportive all around.  Our appointment lasted at least an hour, if not more. The entire staff stayed after the office had closed, because we were the last patients to leave. They didn't rush us out, everyone was so nice. We were blown away.  Initially, I deducted 1 star from my review for the hour wait, but when I realized how much time and attention Dr. Heiland dedicated to each patient, I added the star back, because no one likes being rushed, and it is important to really HEAR your patients.  Second Appointment: October 4th @ 2. My infection had resolved itself, thank goodness! I went in for a follow up appointment just to verify. My appointment was at 2, but again, we didn't see Dr. Heiland until later (shrug). Once we did, Dr. Heiland was really nice and funny, as usual. The visit/exam was only about 10 minutes. He did explain precautions/what to do in the future, but it was an in and out kind of office experience.  Perhaps the best part was that when my boyfriend and I left the exam room, the two medical assistants AND the office staff stood up and shouted "Yay!" and clapped for my lack of infection. It was seriously adorable.   I maintain 5 stars for this entire situation, despite the tardiness. I really valued being listened to and being treated like a whole person. I think it's great that Dr Heiland's whole office team are so nice. I like EVEN MORE that he treated my infection and it went away. Thank you!!

Brace yourself Yelpers, here comes a novel:  Here is my situation: I live in a townhome and found out that my next door neighbors have a bed bug infestation (eeeek!). We share a wall, so I am terrified. I have searched my entire home and can't find any evidence of bed bugs, so I want a preventative service, just in case!  On paper, APS was exactly what I wanted: - Positive reviews on Yelp - A- review from the BBB (I even read the reviews on the BBB website and took the complaints with a grain of salt) - A Yelp voucher! $45 for $100, which worked for my budget.  HOWEVER, it all went downhill with my FIRST call to APS:  Strike 1: When my first call kicked over to voicemail, a generic greeting informed me that the mailbox was full and I was unable to leave a message. Without a personalized APS greeting on the voicemail, I wasn't even sure that I had called the right number.   An APS employee, named Arman, called me back. I explained my situation and warned Arman that I was/am completely stressed and didn't even know what questions to ask... if these guys had told me that they treated bed bugs with the bone marrow of a baby t-rex and needed two weeks to do so, I may have believed them. Despite my Class A pest control idiocy, Arman still took the time to speak with me. He told me APS is locally operated, flexible with time, and close to my house.  We were disconnected once, but, in total, the conversation lasted for about twenty-five minutes (Arman did most of the talking). The conversation was pleasant enough so I told Arman I needed to speak with my boyfriend and he offered to call me back in a couple of hours. The boyfriend came home and we discussed the call, during which time I realized that I didn't know any of the following information: 1. The ballpark price of an APS service. 2. What the APS process is.  3. Approximately how long the process will take. 4. What the service will entail.  Strike 2: Despite the twenty-five conversation, I didn't have any of the information that I actually NEEDED to know.   Arman didn't return my call, and I didn't return his. Cut to yesterday morning. I called APS back, hoping to clear up some of the fuzzy details. A man named David answered the phone. Since this wasn't Arman I said "Hi David, my name is Rachel, I'm calling about bed bugs."  David said "Yeah, I remember you, I spoke with you yesterday for like thirty minutes, how can I help you?" At that moment, I was taken aback for two reasons. 1. I am certain I didn't speak with a  David. 2. David immediately sounded annoyed when he greeted me. When I explained to David that I needed more information from him, he made no attempt to disguise his annoyance. He even gave me the impression that my call was an inconvenience.    When I dare to re-ask about price, David barked, at warp speed, that APS can't do an evaluation over the phone, that other companies would charge me $2500 for a fumigation and that APS would charge less than that, and then said "how's that?". I said "Well, since I don't need a fumigation, are you saying that a spray for my place is going to cost me around $1000?"  His response: "Why won't you just let us come over and do an evaluation?! Why won't you just let us come over?"  Evaluation? Whatever did he mean?! This is news to me!. I attempted to explain, but he cut me off yet again. Finally, I curtly say "Sir, no offense intended, but if you would let me finish my thought, perhaps you would understand my situation better...". To which he says "No, no, I have been listening..."  which was laughable, if nothing else.  Strike 3: LISTEN. Don't assume that you know your customer's problem and then talk over them.  Before I could respond, I heard a click, and I was suddenly talking to someone named Arman (but still not the original). Arman 2.0 said that "David needed to step out". That's right Yelpers, in the middle of our phone call.  Strike 4: Unless you have just cut off a limb, are going to crap your pants, or the building is on fire, you don't to "step out" with no explanation.  Arman 2.0 gives me more snarky attitude until I forcefully RE-EXPLAINED my situation, which resulted in a useless attempt to salvage the call.  I am completely stunned that these two people are allowed to handle calls from potential or existing clients. I am even more STUNNED about the rating they've earned here on Yelp. Over 4 stars! Who are the APS people that Yelp reviewers dealt with and where can I find them?   Instead, I spoke with two of the most unhelpful and condescending people I have ever experienced in "customer service" industry. Thanks for showing your true colors before I gave you any money, APS! What a huge relief.

David Marshall, the "President and CEO" of Arizona Pest Squad, promptly took the time to write a response to my initial Yelp review. His response perfectly illustrates why I sought out another company for my pest control needs. One of my main concerns with APS was their inability and unwillingness to listen when I called them.  Mr. Marshall's response details his interactions with another client (who he must have me confused with). I can only assume that this confusion is a direct reflection of APS's listening skills.   The details of my actual pest control needs are available in my initial review. However, I can safely say that the response from APS's CEO has only solidified my decision to look elsewhere.  Cheers.

I'm writing this review on behalf of myself and Rob, my boyfriend, since I carry the Yelp torch in our relationship. We discovered Tortilla Fish during one of our late night trips to Walmart. We totally drooled over the idea of a little taco shop (Rob especially, as he loves tacos from San Felipe). We promised that we would go back during business hours.  Yesterday, we were in the area and decided to stop at Tortilla Fish. Not sure what to expect, we walked in to Tortilla Fish's TOTALLY ADORABLE little restaurant. The walls are blue with some fun subway tile, with lots of beautiful photos. Clean and cozy are two of the words that come to my mind. I got so excited when I later noticed the sea shells in the subway tile. So cute and original.  The employees were really friendly, especially when we told them it was our first time in. They gave us recommendations, told us about their best sellers, and even gave us some sauce combinations to try. Supremo customer service at this place.  I ordered two shrimp tacos and a cup of water. Rob got the full taco, a fish taco, and a soda. I think the total came to $15.22, which I thought was quite reasonable for two people. The tacos were $2.99-ish each, so I could easily see spending more than $15 if you came in HUNGRY.  Our order came up after only a few minutes, and OH BOY! The shrimp in my tacos were HUGE and there were plenty of them. Two thumbs up for emphasis on the SHRIMP in shrimp tacos. The fish in Rob's taco was stacked so high, he grabbed a fork (but didn't end up using it except to clean out the dish when we had finished).  I used the avocado and cilantro sauces on my tacos, with cabbage and onion and fresh cilantro, and all I can say is YUM YUM YUM. And the corn tortillas? Brilliant. Very soft and tasty-- though a word to the wise, if you plan to overload your taco with accessories, the tortilla may break (which, for most of us, is no problem. Give me a fork or I'll eat it with my fingers. Tastes good all the same). Lastly, I really appreciated that the contents of the salad bar are clearly fresh; they looked pretty and tasted great too.   Rob LOVED the full taco and the fish taco (to quote him, "all that was missing was a beach with no surf"). He used a combination of pico de gallo, cilantro sauce, and (I think) the extra spicy salsa. We were definitely a fan of this little place, so I think we will be returning soon.  Rob and I  say four out of five stars and would definitely recommend if you are in the mood for some clean, tasty tacos.  PS: Don't forget your phone in the car, because you get 15% off your order with your first Yelp check in. No worries, I will save it for our next visit!  -------------Update!--------------- After writing this review today, and then reading it over with Rob, we decided to go back to Tortilla Fish for lunch. That's right, less than 24 hours from our initial visit, we returned. And AGAIN, the food was delicious.  The employees remembered us, said "Welcome back!" and thanked us. A+ guys. Thank YOU!  I tried the fish taco today and WHOA. I think it is my new favorite. The fish was so moist and delicious it melted in my mouth. Topped with cilantro and avocado sauce and fresh cabbage, onion, and cilantro again, definitely a win.  Also...do yourself a favor and get the french fries. No, seriously. When one of the  employees said "We have the best fries I have ever tasted" I was skeptical, but I think he's onto something.  These fries were EASILY some of the best I've ever had, if not the best. They're a nice size and density, and are even a little flakey on the outside. Serious and overwhelming yum for these fries. Oh, and for a tasty treat, drip them in the chipotle sauce. Really flavorful and smokey. Thumbs up, all around.  Rob had two full tacos this time and was just as pleased today as he was yesterday. Bumping up to a 5 star from my original 4. Tortilla fish, we'll DEFINITELY be back.

Loooooooove this place, but just found a "Store Closing" sign on their door. Limited hours, 2-6. Get there while you can!   So sad to see you go,  UC... You were one of our FAVORITES!

To the other Yelpers who reviewed this place, THANK YOU!   Gilbert and company were a pleasure to work with: the price was right ($29.99 for an oil change my Prius) , the entire shop is spotless (inside the lobby and in the work area), and my car was done in a flash. I could not be more impressed. This has become my new oil change place. No problem.    Happy to leave these guys 5 stars. See you soon!

This was my first time at ChopHouse and I will definitely be going back. It has a darling, modern, cozy vibe about it. The patio is my favorite part-- complete with globe lights, chairs, umbrellas, a fireplace, and giant chess! The inside is decorated just as well; think urban country, or shabby hipster chic. And, get this ladies and gentleman: each table has a PURSE HANGER on the side of it. Why yes, that was an incredibly nice touch, indeed. Though, I'm glad my purse wasn't particularly heavy, for fear that it would have taken the table down.  Each of the three employees we spoke with were very friendly and accommodating. One even gave me some recommendations about the menu since I hadn't been in before. Also, the men's denim shirts are a rad choice as a uniform. *thumbs up for all around styling*  Initially I ordered a small Green Glory juice-- which had kale, apple, kiwi, ginger...and something else. It was seriously so delicious that after I finished the first, I ordered a large juice to go. Of course, $10 for a 32 oz. cup of juice seemed steep, but it really was so fresh and tasty that it ended up feeling more like a meal than a beverage. So, perhaps I won't be able to come to ChopHouse everyday, but $10 for something healthy and delicious was infinitely better than the $6 I would spend on a venti sugary whatever from Starbucks. ChopHouse, you win!  I also ordered the Cheat Day Burrito (I think that was what it was called?). Eggs and avocado, with bacon and turkey with brown rice, in a wheat wrap. No tomato. YUM! The salsa that comes on the side is very flavorful too. Of course, I couldn't finish said burrito (what with all of the juice I had consumed) so I brought the leftovers home for my boyfriend, who was equally as pleased by the burrito. The juice didn't make it home.  After reading some reviews about the rushes that ChopHouse gets, I was worried that we would have to wait a long time for our food. Not the case. We arrived at the perfect time this morning, since we were the only customers inside the restaurant. Eventually, we migrated to the patio, which was also a great choice. Hello October in Arizona, right?  I can't wait to return to ChopHouse. It's inspired me to attempt juicing for myself (which may fail miserably). Thanks ChopHouse!

Boom! First time to Copper Blues Tempe? Epic Success!  We has the pretzel appetizer with beer cheese. Let men just tell you, if beer cheese is up your alley, you won't be let down. The mini baguette shaped pretzel and a generous dish of cheesy magic is DELISH.   Now, if you brought your appetite, get the chicken nachos. There's enough for four. No exaggeration. Instead of a flat nacho tray, Copper Blues serves this dish in a mountain of crispy chips, black beans, cheese, chicken, Pico de Gallo, and a cream based spice sauce for a bit if heat. Oh my gosh. YUMMMM.   Becca was our server, and she was a blast. Totally on top of our drinks and food, and had us cracking up. She also knew how to check in on us without interrupting the a conversation. A+++ girl!   And, BONUS, the band that was playing tonight was excellent. Apparently, they play on Wednesday nights (they're called Chad Gregory and the Truth, or the Chad Gregory band... I think). Gritty rock n roll vocals and exceptional rhythm section. Seriously talented fellows. Can't wait to see them again.   If you're looking for a fun, casual place to hang out, with great decor, fabulous food, and stellar entertainment (and a Wednesday, no less. Who else does that?!), look nice further.   Copper Blues, tonight was a pleasure. Thank you!
