I was in a bind. I needed paint markers for a sign I was producing and couldn't find them anywhere in the area. I was driving around frantically looking for office supply stores and happened to see this Michaels. I went in and the manager and the staff were very busy helping customers but they found time to help me find exactly what I needed. They knew just what I would need to get the task done. I paid and left and procedeed to go paint my sign. Half way through I realized I needed another kind of paint to finish it up and frantically rushed back to Michaels. The manager called over the PA and got a painter to come help me find exactly what I needed. Thanks a bunch!

I wish I could give this store 0/5 but it won't let me so it gets one star. I went in here a few times after work and got stuck in line for seriously 15 minutes plus! While talking to another customer in line about sports, movies, the neighborhood and work we eventually touched off on how this store used to be in the past. Apparently there used to be self-checkout stands but they removed them. Removed them? Why on earth? Anyways, having one cashier on the clock and no self-checkout stands is a recipe for disaster and poor customer service.

I have been eating here for about two years now maybe twice a month and after some late night activities. What really stands out to me is their carne asada fries and how they got rid of a new years hangover. They offer quick service, a salsa/condiment bar, huge menu and excellent meat. This is not your neighborhood Filibertos. The only reason I give it 4/5 stars and not 5/5 is we need a drive through!!

I brought my car in just to see what preventive maintenance could be done on the transmission. It had 140,000 miles and no previous transmission work. The staff at this Aamco took my car for a test drive and inspected it for free and even told me the best option for service instead of trying to upsell me on some huge expensive maintenance or replacement program. I ended up not choosing to do any work and they gave me the inpection for free and even explained a breakdown of the mechanics diagnosis to me. Thanks for the help, if I do ever need work on my vehicle I will bring it here!
