Everyone is so friendly at this location. My husband and I come here only when there is a movie in theaters that we are looking to see but the bartenders always remember us and our order. We feel like regulars even though we are only here about once a quarter.

ER Doctor was great! He was very reassuring. The wait was not long at all and the staff was all very friendly. Although the ER is never a fun place to be the friendliness and thoroughness of the staff was awesome and made for a quick and nearly painless visit.

Kona has the best happy hour/ reverse happy hour around. The food and drink specials are amazing! I would highly recommend checking it out. The only down fall is that you can't (or at least I couldn't) find the happy hour menu online to show my group of friends when we were planning out where to go.

My experience was fabulous! I went in with 7 other girls for a bachelorette party not knowing how large and accommodating this place would be. When we got there they had a banquet room open and ready, and ice bucket for our wine (you can bring your own wine, awesome right?) and a bottle opener for the wine (thank goodness because we had forgotten one). We had each were going to purchase a travel zoo voucher for an hour massage and 35 minute facial but they said we could just pay as we came in rather than hoping there were enough vouchers available. That was super convenient for everyone. Even with some of us extending our services we were out of there in 4 hours. I wasn't aware that they had such a large staff! It was a wonderful experience. My massage was fabulous and the therapist took the time to let me know some stretches I can do that will prevent my back from getting tight. The facial was amazing too! The only thing I can complain about is that when we went to check out the gratuity was automatically 20% of the original cost of the services (not the travelzoo rate) so everyone's bill ended up being twice as much as they were expecting to pay. I just wish they would have been upfront with us when scheduling the appointment or when we arrived so that we didn't end such a relaxing session with the shock of an unexpected cost. That part was probably on the voucher but because we hadn't purchased one I wasn't aware. Either way it was a fabulous deal and my bridesmaid were so impressed with the whole day and intend on setting up follow up appointments with the massage therapist for themselves and their husbands.

This place has a very low key feel to it.  The bar is outside (which I loved) and the food is indoors. The only complaint I have is that we sat outside with menus in our hands for 15 minutes waiting for someone to take our order only to learn that you order inside and they will deliver the food to your bar stool. It would have been nice to get those instructions when we were handed the menus. Either way the atmosphere was excellent and the food was good.

I booked this hotel through Priceline for my one year wedding anniversary and was really happy to have gotten a "4 star hotel" for $100 a night. Unfortunately, after researching reviews on this hotel I found that google reviews, yelp and trip advisor had this hotel listed as a 3 star hotel with many recent reviews mentioning bugs in the hotel. I immediately had a small panic attack and tried to cancel or move my hotel stay to another hotel. I am terrified of bugs and did not want this incorrectly rated hotel to ruin my special day. I contacted priceline who placed me on hold and when they came back on the line said they called the hotel to verify they did not have bugs. Basically I was stuck with this reservation.  Anyway, I stayed at the hotel and paid an additional $50 when we checked in to upgrade to the suite in hopes that the room would be nicer (ie bug free). When we checked in the room was a little dated and there was a flying insect in the room but all in all it seemed decent - not 4 stars - but doable since we weren't going to be in the room much anyway and didn't want to just be out the $150 we ended up paying to stay there. My husband and I went out and had an awesome anniversary - came back and went to sleep with no issues.   However, the next morning while we were getting ready for brunch I was leaning in close to the mirror to do my make up a spider crawled right by my face and into the closet where I assume it lives along with the other insects we ended up seeing that morning. I immediately rethought everything I had done that morning. Did anything crawl into my clothes I laid out to wear that day? Had anything gotten into my purse that had sat open? I immediately broke into hives and was itchy at the thought and almost left everything I had brought behind.   So although this hotel did not ruin my anniversary night - it did ruin my anniversary brunch and the rest of my weekend. Unpacking my suitcase and even just reaching into my purse the following days was horrifying. I wish priceline would have understood my very real fear of insects and at least tried to work with me. Lesson learned - priceline does not care about its customers and always check yelp reviews before you book your hotel .  Dont stay here if you are also terrified of bugs

Great food! Great happy hour! Unique place. I will definitely be returning for many happy hours to come :) I had the shrimp toast, the escargot and the clam chowder. Yum, yum and yummmm. The clam chowder reminded me of fresh clam chowder from the pier in SF.

I have been attempting to enroll at this school for the last several weeks without any luck. As soon as I submitted my request for admission they requested a copy of my ID and my high school diploma - which I would like to say is a reasonable request. The problem, however, lies in how they would like this information transmitted. When I called into the school the first person I spoke with said to (only) email a copy of my id to the PROP 300 email address - which I did. After a few days and no update I called financial aid who said they do not accept emailed ID's that I would have to fax it- which I did. After a few days I called in to check the progress and was told that they, in fact, do not accept faxes only emails and I needed to attach a declaration form to have it cleared.  I then sent in an email with the declaration and my id only to receive an email that said they do not accept black and white scanned copies of ID's and they also do not accept cell phone pictures of ids. '  It had been 10 days and I had had enough of this back and forth. I just wanted to ensure that I would be enrolled on time.   I decided to go down to the school to handle this matter in person. When I arrived I sat in a waiting room for student services where there were 8 empty windows and only one person helping students. After a half an hour wait to speak with someone I finally was told that the matter should be cleared immediately but to keep an eye on it because if it doesn't clear then I could be dropped from class and have to start the process over.   *I would also like to mention that when the rep took a copy of my id it was in black and white (cue over dramatic eye roll)   It has been three days since I went down to the school and nothing has cleared. When I called down to the school the representative said it would still be a couple of days. When I told her that is what I have been told for the last several days the representative said 'what are you so worried about?' -- UMMMM what am I worried about? My education! I only need these two extra classes to graduate in January and I'm trying to get it handled but I keep getting the run around. How can this school possibly be staying in business if it refuses to enroll students? If I didn't need these 2 classes I would've given up by now. This has been the worst customer service experience I have ever had.   Rio Salado get your act together.

Awe, I hate that out of all of the people that shop at this cvs the only people that reviewed were negative. I have lived in this neighborhood for 3 years and have frequently shopped at this cvs and have had a wonderful experience every time. The staff is so friendly and welcoming. A really sweet woman on the day shift remembers me from when she developed my wedding photos. The man on the night shift is so awesome! Him and I talk about the weather 'back home' in the Midwest every time I'm in the store. I love that they remember me here. I get the warm and fuzzy a every time I shop here. The employees are just good people.

I love this place here's why:   I ordered flowers through one of those 1800 or pro flower companies online and when they arrived they looked horrible. It was really embarrassing for me and the person I bought them for. I found Gloria's online and explained the problem I had with the other company. The person I spoke with made sure the new flowers were delivered right away! My friend even said the delivery person was super nice and felt really bad that she had received such awful flowers from the previous company- (they were horrible-dead- droopy flowers- NEVER use those generic online sites).   Anyway, because they were so awesome I have decided to use them for my Wedding :) and when my wedding changed to a quick and cheap elopement ceremony they were kind enough to work with me on the price of my bouquet.   This place will always have my business. Thank you :)

This was my first time trying Gandolfo's and I loved it!   I ordered the Urban Cowboy: Chicken breast, turkey, bacon, pepper jack, cream cheese, lettuce, tomato, bbq sauce and mayo   It was so delicious. I can definitely see myself craving this sandwich and having to come back in the next couple of weeks.   It was pretty pricey but there is a groupon for it right now so check it out!

My husband and I came to order takeout at about 9:30 and the place was practically empty (not a good sign). I had been here before several years ago and loved it and have been waiting to get my husband out here to try it. We ordered 6 sliders and shoe string fries to go and didn't like any of it. The fries had barely been cooked and were flaccid. The burgers were cold and tough like they had been sitting out for a while. It was a huge let down.

I have been here a few times and love this place! The brunch is fabulous! I get the mimosa with their heffe and the breakfast pizza. Yum! I recently brought my dad here who is very difficult when it comes to trying new things. (he didn't like four peaks! Who doesn't like four peaks??). He loved the very chill atmosphere of the downtown chandler area and loved the beers and the service at San Tan. This is the perfect place for brunch or even a low key night out.

I have gone to tropical smoothie for the last 4 years because it is near my work and the company I work for had set up a business agreement that offers us a percentage off our order. I have always had a great experience there but the last two times I have ordered from them I have had the worst customer service experience from the same cashier. Last time the cashier was really rude to me off the bat but I brushed it off assuming she had just had a bad day. I had asked for my company discount and she said she wasn't familiar with it so they must not offer it. When I asked her to check she said she had been there for a couple of months so she would know. It wasn't worth making a big deal about so I paid full price and left. Today I went in and the same cashier was at the front so I didn't even bother asking for the discount but the cashier was still really rude. I placed my order and went back to work only to find my order was made COMPLETELY wrong. When I called in the same cashier answered and I asked to speak with the manager this is how the conversation went.   Me 'Hello I would like to speak to the manager, is she available?'  Her 'no she's not here'  Me 'ok... Do you know when she will be back?'   Her ' ummm I don't know. Ummm Maybe Sunday (giggle)...'  Me ' maybe Sunday? Ok, can I have her name please'  Her 'Ummmmm...'   Me 'your managers name, please?'  Her 'Kim?'  Me 'And what is your name?'  Her 'Clarissa?'   I clearly wasn't going to get any help from this girl so I ended the conversation at that point

My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton on a whim after a concert downtown. The rooms were nice and there is a bar down stairs.The only downfall I would say is that the gift shop is operated by a third party and closes early and there are no stores close by. We ended up having to take a cab to go get me face wash and medicine. I would have given this hotel 5 starts if they had the convenience of an all night gift shop like the Hyatt and Westin.

I had to call twice to place a to go order because they weren't answering the phone. When I got there I could see my order behind the bar but wasn't addressed for 15 minutes and the place wasn't even busy. The food was just alright. I'd much rather eat at Saigon or #1 pho.

We tried Public House Garage the Saturday before the Superbowl on a whim and absolutely LOVED IT. We couldn't understand why the place was so dead. They had all draft beers at 3$ for happy hour which included the normally pricey IPA my husband loves. The Green Chile Burger was outstanding and the fries were cooked perfectly. We got the carne asada queso too and the chips were a little too greasy for my taste but my husband loved them. We will definitely be back!

On a scale of 5 I wish I could give this restaurant a 93! This was the best breakfast I've ever had. My fiancé and I split the Cinnamon Roll to start and it was to die for!  We eat got our own breakfast and couldn't finish the generous portions even though the food was so delicious. I will recommend this place to anyone and everyone I know! It's definitely more expensive than most breakfast places but well worth it! I wouldn't have tried it if I didn't have a restaurant.com certificate but now I'm hooked!   We Split - Freshly Baked Cinnamon Roll:  pecans, dulce de leche cream cheese frosting  I had - Pulled Pork Hash: potatoes, peppers, spinach, poached egg, ancho hollandaise   He Had: Breakfast Tacos: potato chorizo hash, scrambled eggs, salsa roja, avocado  We loved - IT ALL :)   Tip: Try the white sangria

Also, the Teriyaki sauce here is delicious! My husband usually gets the Hot Teriyaki  but its waaaay too spicy for me (and I like spicy foods). They have huge portions! I get the chicken Teriyaki  bowl with half veggies and half rice YUMMMMMMMMM

My order was completely wrong. I have no idea how I order a build your own breakfast crepe, list all of the items I want in my breakfast and end up with the breakfast burrito? The waitress was writing for a while when I ordered and I thought she just wasn't short-hand writing my order which is unusual.. I have no idea what she was writing because when my order came out wrong she showed me the order she had written down (like that solved anything) and all that was written was 'burro'. I had to ask 'so when I said I would like to build my crepe and listed off mushrooms, spinach, ham and onions you heard burrito?' (which obviously has none of those ingredients) her response was 'well, that's what everyone orders'. Are you kidding me????   Anyway, I ate the burrito because I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for my food. it was actually really good I can see why other people order it but I was really craving mushrooms.  #dayruiner

This place is amazing. I was kind of concerned because my husband is Mexican and typically very critical of Mexican food but this place rocked our socks off! My husband got the tacos and I got the enchiladas - both we're amazing! Thankfully we did our research and checked yelp and google before we went so we knew what we were in for.   I'd say this place is busy- know what you want as you walk in. Check out the gadzooks website and write out your order before you go. It will take 2 minutes but it will prevent the deer in headlights look as you struggle to create your meal  I had enchiladas -with half and half tortillas- 1 chicken 1 pork - Christmas style (half green half red) - with jack cheese- green sauce- crema and cotija. (Yep! 2 types of cheese! Boom)   My husband had 2 tacos - half and half tortillas - 1 chicken 1 pork with chihuahua cheese (cheddar) the habanero salsa and slaw  This place is 30 minutes from our place but definitely worth it. We will be back for sure.

Hashtag YUMMMM!   My husband and I tried this place on a whim because he refused to eat at my favorite restaurant for the 5th time in 3 weeks (go figure). We were looking specifically for burgers and beer so the name definitely caught our eye. We came during march madness and the place was packed but had great energy! We sat at the bar and had a couple of beers in doors but near the open patio on a gorgeous day. They have an excellent beer selection! We also did the build your own burger and build your own macaroni and cheese!  Although after all of the additions to our meals it was pretty pricey it was totally worth the cost!  The burger we built was- Angus beef Pretzel bun Bacon Red onion  Mayo Golden mustard (which was kind of sweet) Jalapeños   The macaroni we built was perfect! I definitely recommend this combination. We added- Gruyere  Garlic Red pepper  Grilled chicken   We used the 5$ off your tab yelp coupon which was around 10% of our bill after 4 beers, a burger w fries and macaroni. What an awesome deal! We drive all the way from chandler to try this place and will definitely make it back soon!

The first time we came here the place was packed and there was a 30 minute wait (with no waiting area) so we left. We decided to come back the minute the place opened on a Friday to make sure we got a seat and we were not the only people waiting in the parking lot. We shared a delicious burger and the best wings I have ever had. I recommend trying this place! It will not disappoint. There is a reason why it is always so busy.

I really like the atmosphere at this place but wish there was more seating. The few times I have been it has been overly crowded with barely enough room to stand and it has been really difficult to get the attention of the bartenders. When you are standing on a patio bar during the summer in AZ you don't want to have to wait 15 minutes just to be acknowledged by a server. You're thirsty!

This place is awesome! There's so much to do! We went during the wrong time of year though. Unfortunately, even at noon on a Friday the place is packed with holiday parties so there's no available pool tables or bowling lanes. I'm sure it will be a blast after the new year. This is basically a shiny new version of Dave and Busters.

This place is great! I've been looking for a Vietnamese place near my work and today I found it! The spring rolls were delicious! The pho was awesome and the service was fabulous! I would definitely recommend trying this place.   The only thing I would mention is that the noodles are different than what I am used to. I'm not a pho expert by any means and the noodles aren't bad just a little bit thicker.

Handy is the best! It's super convenient and very tech savvy. You can see when your home cleaner is on his way (like uber and Postmates) which I love! You can leave a tip on the app and make specific requests like 'this time focus on the baseboards and stairs' or 'please focus on the kitchen it needs a lot of work'. My cleaner, Robert, was awesome! He did an amazing job. I was really skeptical to go with a cleaner I knew nothing about and to trust a third party to vet someone that's going to be in my home alone but three of my coworkers use it and highly recommend it so I tried it out and I'm glad I did. The prices are super reasonable and it's really easy to schedule out your next appointments. I would definitely recommend trying this out at least once if you are looking for a one time or regularly scheduled cleaning.

I loved this place! I was on this side of town for my anniversary and convinced my husband to eat here during the first half of the cardinals game because they had the game on. This was definitely my kind of place! Great open atmosphere, live relaxing band, amazing food and bottomless mimosas!  The only issue was that we sat at a high top for 10 minutes without being acknowledged then ended up moving to the bar where the service was not as good as we were hoping.   My husband had the mexican omelette and loved it!   I had the mexican pho and thought it was good but heavier than I was expecting   We took the bacon guac to go and absolutely love it!   I will definitely be back :)

This place is 0 for 3 so far. The first time I ate here was the day after it opened so the place was packed but we had heard so many good things that we decided to wait out the line but order our food to go. When we finally made our way up to where you order they asked us the initial order questions but then continued to ask us what we wanted on our burritos even though the line hadn't moved. To accurately paint the picture for you- I am 5 foot tall standing behind 5 1/2 foot sneeze guard glass as the person making my food yells from the other end of the very loud and very crowded restaurant what else I want on my burrito. Unfortunately at this point the person making our order decides to guess what we want and completely screwed up our nacho order and was visibly frustrated when we finally made our way to our food and explained that is not what we ordered. The only reason we came back the second time is because our parents really enjoyed the San Tan location and wanted to try this location. Again, as we made our way down the line they would add items to our food before we even had the chance to say that we didn't want that. My mother in law is lactose intolerant and didn't even get a chance to say no cheese before they added a heaping handful into her burrito and then received an exaggerated sigh when she told them no cheese and they had to start over. Today my family decided to meet at this location again and even though they were not busy they still could not get it right. My husband ordered no tortilla in his salad but even though the person taking his order nodded that they understood still started the salad with a tortilla at the bottom. My husband didn't mention it because it wasn't that big of a deal but again as my mother in law ordered her burrito with no cheese they still had to remake it. To clarify: my mother in law said I would like a chicken burrito with out cheese then watched him start the burrito knowing he would probably still add cheese hoping she could catch him reaching for it but he moved through her order so quickly that even though she was ready for it she couldn't catch him. How does this place stay in business if they keeping having to remake orders?   Pros: I love fast casual concept restaurants and the food here is good.  Cons: they rush through your order and do not pay attention to what you actually want - or do not want-  in your food.

OMG - LOVE! I'm so glad I came here despite the reviews. My husband and I got a few beers and the wing lunch special. He loved the boss sauce with a side of buffalo extra hot and kettle chips. I got the garlic lemon rosemary (lacking a bit in the rosemary flavor) and dry rub Cajun seasoning with a side of garlic ginger sauce and a Cesar salad. I absolutely loved the garlic ginger sauce! The place has a really cool margaritaville atmosphere that's really chill. We will definitely be back for the all day happy hour on Thursdays!

My husband and I both ordered food and drinks. The drinks took forever to get to the table and both of our meals were wrong when they got to us. I ordered a build your own macaroni which could have been an input error but he ordered straight off the menu and it came wrong. Also when I let the waitress know my order was wrong she said she would be sending a replacement order soon but it never came and I sat eating my husbands tatter tots hoping it would eventually arrive. At one point we asked for the check and a replacement in a Togo box but after we waited and waited it never showed.I know this place is new and we love the location in Scottsdale but this experience was really bad.

My husband and I tried this location again and it was a blast this time! We went during Thursday night trivia which was a so much fun and margaritas were the special (YUM!) ! The food was perfect! the service was on point! There wasn't a wait but if there had been this location is on the No Wait app which is a really convenient way to save your spot in advance. I'm glad we gave this location another chance. We are going to make this our regular Thursday night spot.

Why CB&CB? Why do you constantly disappoint? I love your Scottsdale location and your food is so good! The Chandler location always has the worst service. I live right next door to this location and they are 1 for 5 so far. Today my husband and I sat at the bar for 15 minutes and left after being passed up by the bartenders multiple times. We sit at the bar because generally you receive faster when right infront of the bartender - this is the exception. If you would like to be completely ignored - have a seat at the bar. Want your order wrong? Sit at a table. Want a good experience? Don't come here. Visit the Scottsdale location.
