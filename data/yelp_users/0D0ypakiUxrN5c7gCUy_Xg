I usually don't go to restaurants that are inside a strip mall because I'm a very visual person and the building needs to be appealing to me. I was craving pasta so I decided to google italian places close to me. Found this place so I went there and placed a to go order. The waitress was very nice and she offered me a free house salad with their bread and butter so I can try it since it was my first time there. I ordered the linguine with pink sauce and imitation crab, very good! Great service and great food.

I work near by and decided to check it out.  This mall is horrible. Sorry I will stick to my Kierland and Biltmore!

I love this place for one reason, the prices. Hopefully in 5 years I won't have to shop in this dump because I will be able to afford the regular prices!   The minute I get there I automatically get annoyed, you people there act like animals, it's embarrassing.   One more thing, the strollers and your kids, the damn strollers don't belong in here! It's crowded as it is!

Still finding the best deals. I only go during the week when they first open. In and out in 25 min.. however,  Why are you people still bringing in strollers? So annoying, get a sitter.

LOVE LOVE LOVE the ambience outside! Love the fact the restaurant is in a old style bungalow and the patio is lit with string lights.  I went there for the first time last night 15min before close and I dont know if they usually have music or not..but if they don't, they need it.   Food was great but nothing to die for.

They need to fire their staff and hire new ones.. they are extremely rude and not friendly at all.  Stuff is way over priced too.

I reached out to this company due to all the great reviews. However, no one ever called Me to give me an estimate.

I used to love this place. However, me and my gf came here on a sat at 4pm. Parking lot was empty. We told valet we didn't have any cash and asked if we can park our own car. Seemed like a good deal for me since he didn't have to do his job for free. He declined and told us to park across the street. I thought valet was setup to be a convenience.. However it was an inconvenience for us to run through traffic with heels on. You lost business today.

My place I visit usually was booked up completely. I decided to come here based on the reviews and was able to schedule my appt last minute.  I have no complaints about the service and the treatment I received. The girls were very friendly and attentive. My issue is the tan..I was surprised they didnt spray a layer of barrier cream on my hands and feet. Looks like they only have you apply a regular hand lotion.  My hands and feet look terrible, I have to wear closed toe shoes, been scrubbing my hands non stop after a gf of mine made a comment about my orange hands at lunch- how embarrassing! Won't be returning.

I tried the free week 6 months ago and only went once and wasnt feeling it but i was also not feeling physically well.  After hitting a plateau at the gym and being too lazy to drive to my Zumba Classes. I decided to give this place another try, I am so glad i did! Ive been going every day for the last 2 weeks and this place makes me sweat. The gym or zumba never made me sweat the way this place does. The trainers are great, friendly and push you to your limits. I am also glad that this place is a block from my house no excuses!!

Unfortunately I have to give this place a 1 star- I didnt even make it inside. I was with a group of 7 girls (Bachelorette Party) and they wouldnt let us in unless we bought a table. Meanwhile, while i was waiting for the doorman to find out if we can go in he was letting all his"homies" in and girls that well.. i dont know what kind of favors they did to get in. Anyway, I asked him politely to not waste my time and just let me know if we will be able to get in or not. If not, thats fine we will go somewhere else but dont let me stand there like a fool and watch while you let other people. Very rude.

I'm a big fan of Sam Fox's restaurant so i decded to give this place a try. Super cute decor, super fast service, but a bit overpriced.   I ordered the grass fed steak protein plate with the Red Chili Glazed Sweet Potato. The potato's were AMAZING. So delish! My steak was cold.. however since the potatos were that good i didnt care about my steak being a bit cold. Definitely planning on going back to have some more potatoes!

I love this restaurant. The decor, the ambience and the asian-mex fusion food is incredible! I want to try everything on the Menu. Also, they have Patron on tap! I want to be a regular here.

One star for the shopping. This place needs a new owner and a new staff. Incredibly rude and not customer friendly. I'm sorry did I interrupt your social hour?

The salon is beautifully decorated and complimentary wine is served. I went to go see Jillian after I couldn't stand to look at my hair anymore, it was damaged beyond repair. I was wrong! Jillian made me look beautiful again! Definitely recommend!

I really like this place. Ambience is nice, drinks are great and the service was on point. I ordered various appetizers to share with a friend. It was all good except the gluten free chips that come with the crab dip would need to be changed. They crumble and break! Overall, good spot.. will return.

I love Chicago, the city , the nightlife and the pizza! I was so thrilled when I heard Lou's is coming to PHX. Went to the opening last night and it was everything I hoped for. Service was excellent and so was the pizza. I'm glad they had about 25 of their employees relocate from Chicago to run this shop- keeps it authentic!

I used to come here for years with the original crew. I was out of commission for a while and decided to come back. The lady at the front wouldn't honor both of my passes that I paid for.  You just lost a loyal customer!
