I worked down the block from this joint for years and kept forgetting to stop by the place until I briefly spoke with Uwe at another beer event and was inspired by his jolly nature to get my ass in there and try his beer.  My expectations weren't high for the place overall, and BOY did I feel like a jerk when I found it to be such a nice place with good beer (and plenty varieties of it) and food that was truly delicious.  I figured it would be limited to standard bar food, but they have home style meals as well.  My date got wings, which were good, and I got a chicken plate with mashed potatoes that was just about a perfect portion size for being satisfying, yet leaving room for beers.  The vanilla porter was delicious!

I was happy at first that they could always get me in and serviced in a reasonable amount of time, but then started getting irritated about how whenever I would have something fixed on my vehicle, something else would go wrong. This could very well be coincidence, but it has happened far to often for me to not mention it. I hope everyone else's luck with this place is better than mine!

I don't care what any of you say, this place is the shizzle!  I've been to a LOT of sushi joints in the valley and none of them really have FANTASTIC sushi, merely different price points and presentation, neither of which make these places any more appealing to me.    First off, I tend to favor little hole in the wall joints rather than big fancy pants chains that are trying to be cooler than they really are.  Second, it's the best sushi you can get a a reasonable price.  Third,  if the service is good, that means I WILL be back.  Chance was our server this time, and was so witty and on the ball that it sealed the deal for our return.  We actually discovered Mido by mistake and couldn't have had a more fortunate accident!  My group ordered a number of the, um,  strangely named rolls, some of which were pretty damn delicious, others may not have suited my taste but were interesting nonetheless.  The first experience proved to be comical and appealing for reasons beyond the food;  the Ha Ha (HOT) roll being "a little warm" as an understatement, the sudden fear that the place may turn into a karaoke bar later in the night, and the look of pure raging hatred on the face of a hip Japanese teen when his birthday ice cream was brought to him with a candle and a song.   Fortunately no one ended up a burn victim,  nor is Mido a were-karaoke bar and the kid was not successful in his efforts to use his mind powers to induce cranial explosions in both his mother and father.  Since then, we tend to go there at least once a week (or more) and make it a point to go there anytime someone is celebrating a birthday!  Keep in mind that I live in central Phoenix and drive all the way to Chandler to go munch at this joint.  Since Zen32 closed, there isn't anywhere closer that I enjoy nearly as much.  Can't beat the price for all you can eat sushi, either.  Not even crappy sushi buffets can touch the $20 deal, which includes appetizers, dessert and a plate of sashimi that would run $40 anywhere else.  The three sushi chefs are unique on their own.  Pancho heads up the pack with a friendly attitude and good humor.  Definitely makes you feel welcome and can entertain you in a great deal of different languages.    On a final note, If it's your birthday, be sure to opt in for the free ice cream and let them know it's your birthday!

First off, I will state that, despite the somewhat negative review, I will still visit this place from time to time.  I have only been to Teharu a handful of times and it has never really been horrible, but isn't exactly great, either.   The prices are really low- two people can get stuffed for less than $30.   The problem is that the food isn't always particularly fresh.  It is made, divvied up and placed onto the conveyor belt where it circulates for up to three hours (supposedly).  This last time I ate there, the food was obviously NOT fresh.  I consulted with my server and she very politely explained the three hour thing, then mentioned that earlier in the day they mark the items with a time, but within three hours of closing they stop doing this.  She then took away the items we had issues with, without us even asking.  Didn't even make me feel like a jerk!  One can order from a menu and the items will be made fresh, but it still isn't the best quality.  I have to admit, I am kind of addicted to those Haru poppers, though.  Probably the least healthy thing on the menu, but they are extremely tasty with soy sauce and wasabi.  Now for what really killed it for me-  The Amaebi.  Ama Ebi is sweet shrimp and they way it is usually served is the tail is made into nigiri and the head (and feet) are fried.  It is a delicious dish and I love the fried shrimp heads because they are delicious and crispy. Well, this wasn't the case at Teharu.  It was prepared as above, but the heads were really disgusting;  mushy on the inside and not very crispy otherwise.  Flavor would have been alright had the rest of it been on par.   Have you ever eaten the pan fried shrimp at a Chinese buffet only to find it is mushy and gross?   Same deal here.  I rarely spit out food.  Usually I take it like an adult and chew and swallow, but there were two different things that I spat this time, which is not a good sign.  People talk about the bad service there:  once upon a time it was proper etiquette for someone dining to give a polite wave to a server to indicate that they need something.  Somehow, servers started feeling inconvenienced by this, so nobody seems to do it anymore.   Get the fuck over it.   The servers here have, and they are very response if you politely get their attention.  I have not experienced anyone there that wasn't really nice and helpful (so far).  Even one lady who appeared to be somewhat grumpy and short was nice once I got her attention.    Sure the don't come around often, but my glass of water was never empty for very long and anything else I needed was tended to almost immediately upon getting a server's attention.  Since there are the nifty conveyor belts, servers aren't needed much anyway, plus if you get seated quickly there is the possibility of your meal being really, really quick.  I am guilty of getting grab happy and filling up with a quickness.   Anyway, for the price, it is awesome if one is careful of what one chooses.  I will go back again, but will eat selectively.  Also, I suggest going on busier days since the food, in theory, will be more fresh.  You might have to wait for a seat, but at least you won't be waiting for the toilet at home.  Otherwise, if you only have one bathroom in your place of residence and multiple people are eating there, you might consider sitting on laps;  if you stack up, you can all have diarrhea at the same time.

Updating my review after having visited a few more times:  For what the place is, it's good.  It's a very cheap sushi restaurant where I can gorge myself for around $15 or less.  As long as it is busy, the food stays fresh.  Some of the concoctions are not very tasty, but perhaps someone other than myself would find it delicious.     I can't give it 5 stars since I've had not so good experiences there in the past AND they never give enough wasabi, but the place is cheap and fast, so 4 stars it is.

Well I'm a chile relleno eatin' motherf***r, motherf***r!   And let me tell you, I've eaten a LOT of 'em at a LOT of different places and have had some that were a bit lack luster  (i.e. Chino Bandido's Cheez-Its crusted awkward chile relleno) and a lot that were as delicious as I thought (at the time) they could come.   Tonight I had Chef Brian's chile relleno "TV Dinner" at Angels Trumpet that officially takes the cake as the BEST chile relleno I've ever had.  No joke.  So good, in fact, that once I'm finished, I should pay my cheque, walk straight into the kitchen and shoot the cook.  Why?  Because this chile relleno was so good that I fear it is upsetting the balance of the universe and that's what I do; I restore balance to this universe.  Although it was Mexican to eat, I was in the mood for a Belgian and after a long process of consideration, ended up taking my server, Brendan's, suggestion and ordered the Affligem Brouwerij, a Belgian Tripel.  This ended up being a PERFECT suggestion for both my beer mood and pairing with the delicious food.    I have never been disappointed with Angels Trumpet and will continue to go there until my level of satisfaction is severly compromised.  I assume that will be approximately never.
