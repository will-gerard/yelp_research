I LOVE this place! After the drive thru car wash, they have people who make sure your car is completely dry, so you leave without any speckles. They also offer damp towels to clean the inside of your car as your strolling through the wash and air freshers.  Just make sure you tip them a few bucks!   They also have a dog wash. The dog wash has a ramp to get the dog up to your level, yayyyy for no backaches! The water is warm for the dogs, they have shampoos and conditioners of different kinds and a blow dryer. My dog has a love hate relationship with the dog wash. He loves it because it's warm water, hates it because... Well... He hates being wet and smelling good!

While the food is great, the music was OBNOXIOUSLY LOUD tonight when all we wanted was to converse at dinner. I usually love this place, but regretted going tonight. If I wanted to go to a club, I would have gone to Scottsdale.

This place is HORRIBLE!!! WORST SERVICE, EVER! We waited 55 minutes for our delivery, which was supposed to only take 30 minutes. We live 7 minutes down the road. We called to find out where our delivery was, they said they were "on the way"... No apologies, no "let me find out where the driver is and I will call you back,"....Well, when they FINALLY delivered our italian beef sandwich it had the au jus spilt all over the bag. The other au jus didn't even have a lid and was also spilt, there was about 1/4 of it left. The sandwich was disgustingly soggy. They completely forgot our salad. When we called, we spoke to the manager who said they would give us $1.00 back for the salad, and would send us another sandwich, but refused to refund us. We didn't want another sandwich, we wanted our money back by this point. We even said we wanted our money back because this was disgusting and there was no way we wanted to eat a soggy sandwich!! WHYYY would we want to wait ANY LONGER for another order?? We wanted our money back so we could get the sandwich we wanted from someplace we know has good service. NEVER will I EVER go here, ever again!

My finace found Addison Taylor Fine Jewelry and Scott Berger. Scott is the owner and treats you like family! He is so kind, easy to talk to and full of ideas to get a ring for YOU that NOBODY else has!   When you are getting engaged, it is so much more special to have a ring that was designed for you, that nobody else has - one that just fits your personality and the love you share with your significant other. Andrew (my fiance) and Scott came up with the most beautiful engagement ring and band for me! We also came up with Andrew's ring that looks incredible (and that's an understatement!). We are getting married September 13th, and I will share pictures of both of our rings when we get them.  I highly recommend Addison Taylor Fine Jewelry for ALL of your jewelry needs. You should see his office - he can make ANYTHING! If you are in to watches, this is just the place to go! We are so grateful to have found Addison Taylor and to have done business with them. We are beyond happy with our rings, they seriously are so perfect!

I'm so happy Zipps has finally opened. It's been a long wait. This Zipps is huge! Well equipt with several HDTV's and the usual Zipps shuffleboard. I was there for the two games US played in the world cup and the vibe was something else! Everyone was chanting, celebrating US goals and it was such a great time!  Glendale really needed this out here. While it may be packed on game days and parking may be slim to none, Zipps is super fun and their zipparitas and special wings are GREAT! They limit you to 3 zipparitas, as they should because they are incredibly strong.  Cheers to having a Zipps in Glendale! Hooray!
