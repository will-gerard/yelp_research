Pros : I can honestly say that's the best noodle I've ever had.  Food was dynamite and on par with the bet Chinese food I've ever had.  We tried literally half the menu between our party of 10.  Nothing bad came out of the kitchen.  Cons : They were ill equipped to serve a party of 10 and seemed very disorganized.  We had to flag people down for everything.  Lunch took nearly 2 hours.  Some peoples food came out almost immediately and some didn't get theirs until everyone was completely done.  Service was not atrocious, but it was real close...  I will come back on my own to eat there again, but I certainly wouldn't take a group there.

Everything on paper looks perfect.  We waited 45 minutes for a table that never came.  Called before I got there to make sure it wasn't too bad.  I was told to expect a 20 minute wait.  No biggie.  After a 45 minute wait, I was told another 30 were required.  Had tickets to Tosh so I had to leave.  Thank goodness for the magic speed the brothers from Los Dos Molinos put on their chile rellenos.  It was like they were crossing the Rio Grande all over again.  Screw SB1070,  I need mexican food anyways!  Food may be good, but I'll never know now.

Wish I could give zero stars.  Never have I seen more irate customers.  Everyone was extremely angry.  I had to request a refund and left after waiting for over 30 minutes for a gyro and a salad.   I saw people come 10 to 15 minutes after me and get their food.  When I asked where my food was, I was told the original gyro takes a while....   Soooo precooked, chopped and formed meat, reheated on a griddle takes 30 minutes???   Very unorganized.  They had no idea who ordered what.  Would ask every table if the orders coming out of the kitchen were theirs.  No one knew if it was their order since they came out 2 plates at a time and some people had 5 or 6 people.  Never again!  Just horrible.

By far my favorite sushi in all of Phoenix.  High quality fish, mixed with a good atmosphere.  The proper mix of rice, veggies, and protein in the rolls.   They get very inventive with the specialty rolls and will accommodate anything you ask.   My wife doesn't always love sushi, so they have an "I hate sushi menu" that anyone can order off of.  Good happy hour deals and a staff that's been very long standing.   Anybody looking for great sushi should search out this little hidden gem.

I love this place.  My wife got the Mac Daddy, daughter got the Bear, and I got the bratwurst Stuffed Pretzel.  Crazy cool flavor combinations and a foodies dream.  Bring your hipster friends too.  They'll dig the atmosphere.

My favorite Italian/Tuscan food in town.  I think it's far better than Allesia's in Mesa.  The lobster bisque is the best soup I've ever had in my life.  Not expensive, but reasonable priced based on the food quality.  Good wine menu and something for everybody.  Take the fam or make it a special night out with the wife.  This place will accommodate any occasion.
