Not to shabby.  Went on a Saturday night.  They had a half rack rib special with 2 sides for 12.99.  This was totally worth it.  I ate every bite.  Ribs fell off the bone.  The sauce is where it's at.  Nuff said.

I think it's hilarious that the only person who gave this place 1 star is some schmuck who was upset that the chicken livers weren't organic.  What do you expect?  Unlike lady Alaska, I am thankful that all of Scott's product comes directly from Brooklyn.  I really think that is the story behind this Deli's 21 years of success.    Why have I never heard of this deli in the years I have lived here.  We went in on Good Friday and there wasn't a soul in the store.  We ate a full meal and still no one came in.  The wait staff and owner seemed relieved.  I think this place does amazing business during the day.  Not to mention, the lovely waitress told us stories of how she took 3 parties the other night.  The food here is amazing.  My wife and I shared the smoked fish platter (which is $10 less than chompies and almost twice the size) My dad had the liver and onions which to him is food for the soul.  I tried his and it was really good.  I can't wait to go back there again this week.  The prices are right, the portions are amazing and the quality is above standard for a Phoenix deli.  This place blows Chompies out of the water.  I am so thankful we get a slice of New York right here in Phoenix.  I wasn't a big fan of the mish mosh soup.  I'd stay away from it.  But everything else makes up for it.

One of the few places in the area that will deliver.  I thought I would give it a shot.  I ordered a #2 12inch and a large coke.  With a 10% off coupon I had, the total was around $13.50 with tip everything came out to $16.00.  I begin thinking to myself, "With a Subway and Dilly's Deli next to this place, they better step it up."  They said it would take 45 minutes... no problem.  The sandwich came early... great!  The hot sandwich I ordered was cold and the bottom bread was totally soggy.  My biggest peeve in this world is soggy bread.  The quality of ham is disgusting.  It's slimy and tastes like ham flavoring.  I am not a ham snob by any means, but this is not edible.   For a sandwich that costs this much, they need to use better product.  I was starving when I ordered it.  I ate a few bites and now it's going in the trash.    I predict that this place won't make it through the summer.  In the summer this place will have to rely on all the local business employees.  People like me who would order food everyday from the same place (if it's good) are the people they will have to rely on.  I know people in my office will never call this place again because they were grossed out by my sandwich and baffled by how much I spent on it.    I get a limited time to eat lunch...I don't have time to call and complain, have them remake it and try to eat it again.  I'll pretend I just drank a $16.00 soda.

I love when I have to retract a review I wrote.  Especially when it goes from 1 star to 5 stars.  I've ordered a few more times in the last year and it's been right on every time.  The spicy chicken bowl is wonderful... the salads are great.  I haven't made the jump to reordering a sandwich after my last bad experience but I'll get there.  Delivery is fast and friendly.

This place is the only place I will go in the valley to get a oil change.  I live 25 minutes away and I don't mind supporting this locally owned lube shop.  The prices are fair and competitive.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  Here is the most important part of this place..... you ready?  drumroll.......  This place is honest.  They will not try to sell you a service you do not need.  They will not charge you a arm and a leg for a part.  You need an air filter?  You are going to get the air filter almost the same price you would pay at Checkers.  Feel free to spark up a conversation with the owner Gene while you wait, he has lots of stories and will make the time go quicker.

Ugh, I just made my first Yelp retraction.  I wrote a review of Buono's right before they switched over to new management.  When I got the text from a friend, a twice a week customer to Buono's that they switched owners and the food is now garbage... it was like a family member died.  We had our daughters birthday here, our son and I used to go to lunch here every Saturday.... This was our family establishment.    Sure enough my family had to try the food with the new ownership.  The pizza was garbage.  It was cheapened up... how could it be?  I was in denial.  Maybe it was an off night.  That's allowed right?  So we tried it again, this time I didn't even want to eat pizza.  I tried the meatball parm sammy (which was always my go to meal) it was horrible.  Soggy bread with tasteless meatballs... what struck me the most was this was a Friday night... it was a ghost town!  Two tables sitting at 6:30 and a 20 minute wait for the pizza.  Back in the day on a Friday night, the place was packed and an hour wait for the pizza.    Well, it looks like I am back to square one.  I need to find a pizza place.  I am so  bummed that a place I gave 2 five star reviews now get's 1 star.  Gone are the days....

To be honest, I don't know exactly what to think about this place.  Our old instructor Mr Brian was awesome.  Then he left Saturday's (the only day we could go) and he was replaced by someone who didn't really know how to teach or talk to children for that matter.  They also made my sons class the "misc" class.  What was a class full of kids who were in the same level as him turned into a class mainly of kids who were afraid of water.  So my son got no attention or guidance of things he used to be working on.  He was back to learning how to blow "bubbles"  He eventually just stopped caring and really stopped paying attention.  The new teacher had no idea how to control him and just ignored him.    We went here for 1 1/2 years and I just feel like management doesn't care about the paying customer.  I had legitimate complaints and no one seemed to care.  No one called and asked if we wanted a new class.  Not to mention, I was only told that all classes in his level were full on Saturday's but I could call daily and see if that changed.   If these courses cost a couple bucks a class, I wouldn't care either but I was paying about $20 for a 30 minute class.  Towards the end when Mr. Brian was transitioning his replacement to take over, my son was not taught anything.  I really felt like I was throwing away money and no one bothered to have an answer.  Mr. Brian was really the only person who cared but just told me his hands were tied and there was nothing he could do except enroll my son in one of his classes during the week.  The reason why this place get's two stars is Mr. Brian.  He really is amazing with kids.  If you do decide to go here, only go to Mr. Brian.  He's wonderful at getting kids to listen and explaining what he's doing with the kids.  I now take my son to Chandler Public Swim classes and he loves it.  They are actually teaching him to swim and the cost for classes is 2/3 the price.   For the last 1 1/2 years, my son has learned what to do if he falls into a pool.  While I think it's a incredibly important lesson for a kid to learn, Swimkids focuses on it waaaaaay too long.  If my son still went to swimkids, it would be another year before they actually taught him how to swim.    Bottom line, if you have a two year old and you don't want him to be afraid of water, call and see if Mr Brian has availability.  If not hang up and try later.  Take classes until your kids is comfortable with water and can float on his back for 10 seconds.  After that, quit.  Trust me, that's all they're going to teach your kid until he's 5.

I don't get this place.  They have multiple buildings and multiple doctors in each building but it is damn near impossible to get an appointment unless you call them 7:30am SHARP!  My 6 month old daughter was sick quite often in the first few months of her life and we had to bring her in quite often.  I had better chances of getting tickets to a sold out concert than an appointment at this practice.   When you do get an appointment, doctors constantly contradict each other and put each others diagnosis down often.  I have heard the words, "Don't listen to that doctor, I know what I am talking about."    As a parent of two small children, that is not all to reassuring.  Honestly, I prefer the staff at Conerstone Urgent Care a lot better that this staff.  So you might ask, why do we still go?  The reason, we've had doctors in the valley ten times worse than these people.  They are organized,  they are clean and I like how all their computers are networked through all their offices.  This place is a lessor of other evils.... I personally think they see waaaay too many patients to have a relationship with the family.  When we go, I feel like a number and a price tag to them.

This has gone to the point of absurd.  We have been told we owe a balance of $307 for no insurance.  We have insurance, we have always had insurance.  In the past when our baby has been sick, they have refused to see us because of this past due bill.  My wife has spoken to the billing manager twice who has told us she will run it through our insurance.  My wife has called our insurance company multiple times and has been told that they have NEVER attempted to run this bill through our insurance.  My wife has talked to her human resources department at her work and they have verified that our daughter is on our insurance and always has been.  The bottom line, our end is taken care of.  There is proof that Mesa Pediatrics has made zero attempt to run this through our insurance though everyone in the billing department says they'll "do it".  The lack of effort from their billing department has just made every experience with trying to see a Doctor a difficult one.  I am sure if we had a 0 balance in their system we would be treated differently but the front desk people who have access to letting us see doctors do not care what our excuses are, they will not make an appointment for our sick kids because their system shows a balance.  Even when we tell them this is an issue with their billing department, they don't care.  They have been trained to not make appointments for people with past due accounts.  The only person who can take care of this is the billing manager who twice now has said they'll take care of this and has not.  This is all according to our health care.  It really sucks to have a kid who's sick a lot and cannot see her doctor.  It's come to the point that urgent care has become her primary place.

Don't get me wrong, I looooove Sunflower.  Love it.  I always felt it was missing something.  I couldn't put my finger on it.  Was it the lack of meat and seafood?  Yes it was.  Lee Lee's is everything I have been looking for in a supermarket.  A produce, meat and seafood section that goes beyond my wildest dreams.  I could have spent a few hours in the store but I was on a time schedule.    You know how the back of a market usually covers liquor, meat, seafood and dairy?  Not this place.  It covers meat and seafood and that's it.  it's huge!  They had live tanks with cheap lobster, talipa, catfish, crabs and some fish I have never seen.  Then there is a fish station with every fish I've ever heard of and maybe 20 others.  They'll chop it up for you or fry it free of charge.  The meat section has any cut of meat you could imagine.  Bellies, feet and legs included.  I didn't even know you could buy pork blood by the pound.  The produce is out of this world.  Veggies I have never seen.  Peaches the size of my head.... and every kind of choy you can think of.  Best part, all of it was the same price of Sunflower, if not cheaper.    The aisles are incredible as well.  A whole aisle dedicated to noodles!!  An African aisle!?!!?   Two Korean aisles.  I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  They also had a wonderful imported beer lane but I don't think it compares to the prices at Topps liquor.    I was so overwhelmed on what to buy so I kept it to a minimum.  I bought the produce I normally buy and I saved a good amount of money.  I bought a fish I've never heard of and now I have to figure out how to cook it.  I saved a lot of money buying it.  4 pounds for $7.    Without a doubt, next time I go I am going to have some recipes in mind.  I am so glad my wife likes trying new things because we're going to be having Thai, Korean, African, Chinese food for quite some time.

Man did this place suck.  Sunday night, dead as dead can be.  The only time we saw our waitress was to take our order and pick up my credit card.  We had to flag someone down in the middle of our meal to get some waters (which we never got)  Food was sub par.  Avocado egg rolls were just deep fried guacamole.  It felt like I ate 2 avocados as an appetizer.  One minute after my first bite, we got our salads (now I'm feeling rushed) My wedge salad should have been called "Sliver Salad" or "Molehill Salad"  Not good.  Wife and I shared a pizza which was decent but nothing like the picture in the menu looked like.  Truthfully, I would have returned all my dishes but there was no one to talk to.  I felt horrible for the table next to us.  They had triplets who couldn't have been older than 3.  They waited at least 15 minutes for the server to come up to them and another 15 minutes to get their drinks.  My wife went to the bathroom and saw our waitress in there on the phone complaining to her friend about rent money.  She'd make that money if she focused on her tables.  We left her 10%.  I walked in planning on leaving her 50%.  We'll never go back again.  What a shitty corporate establishment.  My amber ale was good.

Ahhhh the place a Jew can go and get his food :-)  Being Jewish, sometimes I get the urge for Kreplach soup or chopped liver.  This place takes care of all my urges.    From bagels and lox to corned beef, chopped liver and coleslaw sandwich.  I LOVE THIS PLACE.  They would get another star out of me if they lowered their prices.  It drives me batty to see what they charge for their food.  If I were them, I would add another inch to the sandwich to make up for the price.  Defiantly check out this place if you want a mile high sandwich.  If you are from NYC here on vacation, avoid this place at all costs.

We walked out.  Never got to eat.  The waiter was to busy hitting on the 15 year old girls sitting behind us then come up and take our order.  We waited a good 15 minutes and no love.    Not to mention, the food looked over priced for what is was.

I really don't get this place.  I am a buffet freak.  I'll go to a buffet in a dark alley with no lights if they promised all you can eat crab legs.  Sweet Tomatoes is more like a senior hangout.  Well more like a place that has a lot of promises but no follow up.  1 - They guarantee fresh.  HA!  Most of the veggies looked like they were past ripe time and sitting out all day.  The tuna salad tasted like funky chicken (if you know what I mean)  2 - Variety.  I disagree.  You start out with a huge salad bar and some of the veggies are on there twice (sorry but beets shredded and diced is not variety)  Then you have soups, nasty pizza and jello.  3 - Reasonable price.  No way!  $13 per person (with drink) is not reasonable.  I think Golden Coral has twice as much variety and half the price at lunch.  Bottom line, don't go here.  Even if grandma wants to go and she's paying, just say NO.  The only reason this place got 2 stars is because of the friendly service.  They were even willing to refill your drinks for you.  But that's no reason to go there again.

This place, you can't go wrong.  HUGE menu, GREAT service.  You have to wait a little bit to get in (they do not take reservations)   This place is worth your time and money.

Best Philly Cheese Steak in town.  A large will feed 2 people.  The honey hot wings are really good too.  Overall, this is a wonderful "cheap eats" they always have a food specials and drink specials.  They know the economy isn't doing so well and they price the food out accordingly.

This Fry's makes me feel like I am at the Ritz Carlton's of grocery stores.  I feel this place is nicer than AJ's Fine Foods.  It's the same stuff and the same prices as other Fry's just in "palace" mode.    Really clean, lots of variety.  Great deli, bakery, meat, seafood sections.  They even make their own sushi.  A rainbow roll is only $7 which is nice.  The wine selection is phenomenal.  They even have someone to help you.  The employees are friendly and helpful which I find hard to come by these days.  I have 5 markets in a 2 mile radius and I've decided to drive 10 miles out of my way to come here.  Kudos!

I need to set this up a little bit.  My wife and I have lived in Scottsdale for a year.  We've gone out to eat quite a bit.  I have to say I have not been impressed at all.  Don't get me wrong, we have our haunts that we like to go to quite a bit.  When it comes to new places I am a little scared.  We went to Chart House on Mothers Day, busiest day in the restaurant land.  My mother wanted to go.  My 70 year old father likes the "salad bar" at the Chart House.  I figured we were going to a "senior" joint and fortunately we were not going to spend a lot of money.  I was wrong on both ends.  The location is wonderful.  It's on a man made lake/pond thing which gives the customer a wonderful view.  For a moment I felt I was out of the dessert.  The decor was nice.  on to food.  THEY WERE OUT OF EVERYTHING.  I wanted prime rib, no prime rib.  I wanted ono, they were out of ono.  I got the Asian Seared Tuna with a wasabi cream sauce.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It was a wonderful cut of tuna, no fat on it.  The sauce was INCREDIBLE.  It had a kick, if you like don't spicy, this is not for you.  I can't remember what my wife and mom ordered.  I know my dad had a steak and it looked and tasted good but I would never order it here.  You can get a better steak somewhere else.  This is more of a seafood joint.  The salad bar was unique and very up class.  They make ceaser salads fresh for you.  Anchovies are available.  You can build your own salad which has many unique toppings to choose from.  The icing on the cake was the caviar.  Lots and lots of caviar.  My dad and I had maybe 3 plates of caviar.    Overall the value is good for a $$$$ dinner.  It was nice to take my parents there on a special day.  If I were to go back, I would just get the salad bar.  It's not cheap on it's own, but cheaper than the entrees.  The selection is top notch.

I am writing this as i sit and wait for my car stereo to be installed.  I am on my second hour waiting as i was originally told it would be 45 minutes.  This place is pretty much a joke.  I can imagine they thrive on people who know nothing about their car and have lots of money to spend.  As i wait for my overpriced stereo to be installed, i decided to price check lots of products that they sell.  Speakers that sell for 200 are priced on amazon for $69.  Stereos that sell for $600 are $200 on crutchfield.  The only reason this place got 2 stars is they price matched the stereo i bought with crutchfield's price.  I also complained about their prices on all the additional things needed to install the stereo.  Bottom line, i paid 40 bucks more than crutchfield charges for everything needed. That includes the GMOS and antenna adapter.  I would have paid a friend 50 to install it so i feel i came out on top here.  Will i ever come back here again.... Hell no!  I would buy the product from crutchfield and get someone to install it for me next time.

What can I say?  This is my favorite place in the world to eat or drink.  I don't know where to begin.  At both locations whether it's busy as all hell or dead, we are always seated pretty promptly.    The beer is top notch.  Kiltlifter is my #1 favorite beer of all time.  I've tried them all and they are all very competitive but Kiltlifter takes the cake.  Onto the foodies.  Without a doubt, any burger on the menu is going to be monstrous and delightful.  Mushroom and Swiss is my backup but I've recently fallen in love with the Jalapeno burger.  It's cream cheese, roasted jalapenos (not spicy) and onion straws.  For $9 you can't beat it.  I really haven't strayed away from my favorites (I tend to stick with what I love) but anything anyone has ordered on the menu, there has never been a complaint.  Without a doubt, if you are just visiting for a day or two in Tempe or Scottsdale, this is the place you want to go for lunch or dinner.  It will save you on the pocketbook and you'll leave with a smile on your face.  They also play wonderful music and have lots and lots of television.  I have also never had to wait longer than 5 minutes to sit at a table.

What can I say?  I am happy this place has two 5 star reviews.  I came in here last minute to get an alignment.  Not only was the price GREAT for an alignment, there was no bullshit that went along with it.  They quoted me an hour and sure enough, it was an hour.  I asked them a few questions about my car (like what's that sound) rather than them seeing that as an opportunity to rip me off and make some money, they  were honest.  All I want in a car company is honesty.  I got it here.  I will be going back here again and I will make this the only place I ever take my car again.

I think they are referring to the buses that pick you up and take you to the river.  If that's the case, they are wonderful.  They grab your tube for you, give you tubing pointers and get's the energy up for your long day in the sun.  Good people.

BEWARE THIS PLACE WILL RIP YOU OFF!!!  MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THE TOTAL OF YOUR ORDER WITH THEIR MENU PRICES!  My wife and co workers ordered food last night.  They asked to pay separate for their orders.  The restaurant said it wasn't a problem.  They noticed after the fact that all 7 people were charged a $3 delivery fee.  THAT'S $21 ON TOP OF THEIR TIP THEY ALREADY GAVE THE DRIVER!!!  No one bothered to tell them they were getting hit up 7 times for a delivery fee, including the driver.  They also asked if there were any specials or coupons going on at the moment.  The person on the phone said no.  They received a menu with their order and sure enough there were coupons.    On to the food, my wife's portion to the feast was salad.  For $14 she received 2 salads that fit in two small containers.  She said that a 99 cent salad at Wendy's had more going on than her $14 salads.    That's the last time anyone in this family orders from Rosatti's.     The bottom line is this area is CRAWLING with amazing Italian food.  IMHO, there is no room for ripping off your customers, there are so many other options in this area to choose from.  Judging by the low reviews and lack of effort this company is making to make things right, I can't see them being in business much longer.

I've been to better Outbacks in the ghetto's of Detroit.  Went once, ordered prime rib...ordered it med rare, it came out gray.  Server NEVER came back.  Wife finished meal, went to hostess stand and asked for manager.  Manager apologized, didn't take plate away.  Server came back and I asked her to get this plate out of my site.  She told me not to be angry, she had other tables.    My food was comped, got a $25 gift card, left hungry.  Gave card to a friend.  I'll never go to a chain steak place again.    I was also told by a former Outback manager that Downtown Scottsdale Outback is one of the lowest rated Outback's in the country.  Go figure.

I guess this place closed down (just like everything else on that corner)  but I am crossing my fingers that it re opens again soon.  That is why I decided to write this review.  My wife and I go here for brunch.  We love it.  Ingredients are fresh and the menu is constantly changing.  The bloody mary is the best in the valley.    One thing I don't agree with is their fried chicken is not that good.  It's their special Sunday thing and it's only available for a few hours.  It's so so.  Other than that, everything on the brunch menu I can vouch for.  This place is a little break from everything else in Snottsdale.  The portions are not overwhelming, but you eat everything on your plate and you are full  This place would get a solid 5 stars if it was cheaper and they hired better servers.  The server Pamela is the only good server there.

This is a review for the Birthing and Family Suites.  My wife and I just had our first baby.  We stayed there for 4 days and 4 nights.  This place is great.  The care and attention they gave my son and wife was top notch.  The staff is incredible.  From the nurses to cleaning staff..... everyone was so FRIENDLY.    Though the Shea suites are known to be nicer, I hear the personnel is not as personal.    I strongly urge you to have your child here.

Compared to the other Walmarts in the area, this place should be torn down to the ground.  It looks old and outdated.  This isn't a Super Walmart.  It's dirty and filthy.  Stained walls and floors, the racks look like they haven't been cleaned in years.  Ugh!  I don't understand why people still go here.  I guess it's close but the products on the shelves are nothing compared to other Walmarts.  I only go here is I need shampoo or kitty litter.

It doesn't get any better than this if you are buying produce.  Their fruits and veggies are cheap and fresh.  The meat selection is decent.  The sausage is wonderful.  It's homemade and a lot of different ones to choose from.  I don't suggest going here to buy a gallon of milk or butter, all of that is overpriced.  But if you need glueton and fat free organic salad dressing at a reasonable price, come on in.    I did not know there was a difference between firm and extra firm tofu until I started shopping here.  Another nice bonus is they will feature herbal specialists and nutritionists speakers from time to time.  I've learned a thing of 2 from them.   I've been to Sprouts and I am more impressed with Sunflower.

I don't know what it is about this place.  I've been going to Los Betos for years.  For some reason it only agrees with me late at night.  Anytime I get it between the hours of 9am-11pm, it's disgusting.  I love their beef burritos and Super Natchos.  Super Natchos weigh at least 3 pounds.

I am so blessed to have this place near my house.  It's the first thing we ate while we were moving in and it's going to be in our lives for a long time to come.  First off, it's pretty expensive for pizza but it's worth it.  A large pie is huge and for a big guy like me, 2 slices is all I can eat.  A combo pizza will run you $20.  The sandwiches are cheap and delicious.  The wings are decent, but not great.  Maybe they taste better when you eat inside.  We always get delivery.  I love alot of things about NYC.  The 2 most important things (besides my sister) are pizza and bagels.  I am happy Joe's NY covers the pizza side.  Oh and they deliver LAAAAATE Thurs-Sun.

I was a huge fan of their Desert Ridge location.  I am so sad to see it's not around anymore.  My first time at the Snottsdale location and I was pleased.  I ordered a mango martini and it was fresh and yummy.  My wife and I did the biggest "no no" you could do at a first time establishment.  I am not talking about sex in the bathroom.  I am talking about ordering the same thing at a family style place.  We both got the Pad Thai, it was out of this world.    I looked around at other things people were getting and I was amazed.  The presentation of the dishes and smiles on their faces made me realize it's all good here.  We'll be going back again sooner than later.

This place is our safe place.  So far they haven't gotten our order wrong, everyone has been incredibly nice and there is always a game on.  The wings are pretty good.  I prefer the golden wings over the hot wings but you can still spice those puppies up.    The best thing about happy hour is the zipperita.  For 3 bucks for a frozen 2 1/2 shots of tequila goodness.  One thing I do not understand about this place is they will not serve you a shot unless you have half a beer left.  They think it controls alcohol intake but what it really does is force me to drink faster.  Big fan!  Please check this place out.

Local bar does good to Scottsdale man.  Cheap drinks, GREAT CHEAP FOOD.  AMAZING SERVICE!!!  Let me repeat.... AMAZING SERVICE.  I feel like I am at home when I go here.  The waitress and bartender know me by name (maybe I shouldn't brag about that)  I go here some Mondays and alot of Thursday's to play a round of free Texas Hold 'em Poker hosted by Pioneer Poker.  It's a great way to meet people and play some cards without being under the pressure of gambling.  Try it out sometime.  Also the stage is pretty good.  They have a good blues man who plays traditional blues on Thursday nights.  I saw a comedy show here once too and it was decent.  At least is was something new.

Where do I begin on this crap fest?  I read some of the other reviews to this place and it's about the same poop, but a different day.  My wife comes from a large Italian family.  We know our Italian.  This my friend is NOT Italian.  The decor was nice, but almost every Italian joint has nice decor.  The menu looked great.  We were so excited.  My wife and I were STARVING when we got in.  We were happy we got seated right away.  They brought out fresh rolls right away and they were delicious.  It's the only reason this place is getting their 1 star. We got our appetizer of calamari and it was disgusting.  I took a bite and couldn't eat anymore.  My wife was so hungry, she ate it all.  She didn't care.  She thought it was gross too.  The breading was finely grated and seemed like it was cooked in very old oil.  It smelled and tasted like yesterday's oil.  It made me pretty sick.  I got Salmon and my wife got breaded chicken.  My salmon was smelly (very fishy) and overcooked.  Like a hockey puck.  The sauce on the pasta was exactly the sauce that came with the calamari, though our server insisted it was different.  My wife's chicken was topped with melted butter.  I am not sure what the sauce was supposed to be, but it was breaded chicken with melted butter.  Needless to say, we took one bite, sent it back and got our bill.  The interesting thing was our server was not suprised in the least bit.  We ordered what we ordered because our server suggested it.  He didn't ask why we were sending it back.  It was almost like this has already happened a few times so far this evening.    Overall, AVOID AT ALL COST.  The place is not cheap and you are not getting your money's worth.

This place is the pits.  I  would imagine NYC pizza would taste like their pizza if it was mailed to them via ground shipping then microwaved. In other words, their pizza is horrible.  I also had wings.  They were red in the middle.  I asked the server what what was about and he said they were not raw, they are pre cooked and flash fried.  He also said the quality of the meat is also the reason it's red.  I wish he just told me they were raw.  I should have known this place sucked when Oreganos next door has a hour wait and this crap hole has no one in it on a Saturday night.

Best chinese food I have tried in Scottsdale.  My parent go here all the time.  The owners are very friendly and stop by our table at least twice a visit.  They always hook us up with a pretty unique deserts.  Their Chilean Sea bass is OUT OF THIS WORLD.  Do yourself a favor and try it.  The cocktails are also really good.  The bartender pours a strong drink and always has a story to tell.  He seems to be there everytime we go.    TRY THIS PLACE OUT.

This place used to be amazing.  My favorite memories of past years is going to this seafood place with my parents.  It's not the same anymore.  We went for my wife's 30th birthday.  My dad decided to join us.  My wife ordered steak and shrimp, my dad ordered steak, I ordered a crab stuffed lobster.  I have had the crab stuffed lobster many times before.  I was craving it.  We got our appetizer's.  Dad got snails, wife and I shared steamers.  My dad was happy with the snails.  But then again, how can you go wrong with snails doused in garlic and butter?  The steamers were steamed little neck clams in a garlic broth.  It was not long neck clams like the rest of the world calls steamers.  I wasn't about to argue with the server that these are the wrong clams.  The food came and for the first time in my life I was asking the server to take back my meal before I even tried it.  It looked dry and over cooked.  I told the server I've had this dish many times before and this is not the way it's supposed to be.  He told me this is what it's supposed to look like and begged me to try it.  I took one bite and I couldn't even swallow it because it was so dry.  Of course the server was gone by this point and didn't come back for 10 minutes to ask me how it was.  While I was waiting for the server to return, I told my family I was just going to get the steak.  They just shook their head and told me not to.  I took one bite of my dad's steak and spat it out.  How do you screw up steak this bad?  It tasted like beef jerky and butter.  My dad and wife would have complained too, but it's my wife's birthday and I am already stealing her thunder.  I swapped my meal out for a steamed lobster.  How do you screw up a steamed 1 1/2 lobster?  Fortunately, that came out fine.  So we left hungry and $300 poorer.  I used to not mind paying the money they charged but now, it is not worth it.  I am really hoping people stop coming here so they can just close down.

So this is what fatherhood has come to.  I haven't been out to eat since my son was born.  Craving an opportunity to write another review on Yelp, I'm stuck reviewing my last oil change.  I went in, the place was dead.  The guy told me there was a 90 minute wait (not to mention it's a first come first serve establishment)  He said it would be best if I come back.  Go back 90 minutes.  No one around.  The guy says it's going to be a 30 minute wait till they can look at my car.  I say I'll wait.  40 minutes later and my car is still sitting where I parked it.  I get frustrated and leave.    Two days later, I arrive right when they open.  This time NO people and NO cars.  It still takes them 45 minutes to do a basic oil change.    I may be Jewish and the phrase "get the car serviced" is a childhood slogan in my family, but even I can change the oil quicker with no tools than these putz's!  Even though I had a $10 off coupon the hours I spent waiting for them to do the job is not worth it.  Don't bother.

The only reason I will go back is if a band comes to town that I cannot miss.  I'll start with the good.  Security is so friendly.  My friend proposed to his girlfriend and they were so helpful into making it happen.  If they kick you out, you deserve it!!  Parking sucks.  It costs money to park and they don't have many spaces.  You have to get early to park and it's really the only good parking around the venue.  Sound is meh.  I've heard better, not often do I hear worse.  DRINKS ARE A RIP OFF!!!!  Either don't drink, come there drunk or sneak booze in (I don't support sneaking it in.  They do pat you down as you enter)  So what we have here is a rip off establishment that is one of the only places in town to see national touring acts.  Fuck it.

Okay, I'm done with this place.  Since my original review, I've been to a few other shows here.  The place just get's worse and worse.   If there is a band that I CAN'T miss, I'll drive to Flagstaff or Tucson to go see them.  I wish I could take it back when I said that security is friendly.  They're really not.  One of my friends has been kicked out more times than he's stayed through an entire show.  We're not talking about someone who picks fights with people.  If anything he's tipsy and having a good time.  They always find a way to kick him out.  Drinks and fees cost too much money.  Like I said before, I rather use it towards gas money to go to Flagstaff and drink for cheap at the Orpheium Theater.  The patdown to get in is a JOKE.  I actually wore PJ bottoms last night so I wouldn't get hassled.  The guy still opened my pack of cigarettes to smell and see if it smelled like pot.  REALLY?!  Come on!  I'm not 16 and I'm not stupid.    Sadly, there is another show tonight that I really want to go to.  I have decided to skip it to stop supporting this place. I have certain standards in order for me to spend x amount of money on a fun night out.  This place does not deliver.   Until this place is under new management, they have lost my business.

So after getting a flier on my door for this place.... loaded with large print coupons for enormous amounts of food for next to nothing prices, I had to try it.  I ordered a 18inch 2 topping pizza and 20 wings for $13.  Sounds great right?  Came out to $15 with tax.  I thought to myself, swell deal, better than any pizza place I've ordered from.  When the guy came to the door he said it was $24.  I figured he got my order wrong.  Nope, I was wrong... THERE WAS A $8 DELIVERY FEE!!!!!  What!  I called the place back and told them no one told me this and the flier left on my door step made no mention of this.  The manager told me he meant to call me back to tell me and I should just pay for it.  I told him he was crazy.  I gave the delivery guy a $5 tip and told him I'll never be calling back.  The pizza was horrible.  Tasteless!  The wings were disgusting.    I'll never order again.  I think my point is clear.  DO NOT ORDER FOOD FROM HERE!!!! STAY FAR FAR AWAY!!!!

You know this is a great place when everybody that has reviewed the joint look familiar.    I consider this place my second home.  I know everyone who works there on a personal level.  It's the same people for many many years.  What other place do you know that would close down, reopen years later and have the same staff working?  It doesn't matter what night you go, you are going to get ALOT of good music.  LOTS.  Since they've re-open, the sound system is stellar.  Sound man Ken (who in my opinion is one of the main reasons to go) Ken really puts his heart and soul into sound.  He get's it perfect.    They have a inside and outside stage.  The outside stage has misters which is key in the August nights.  The drinks are as cheap as you are going to get.  The cover to get in depends on the bands.  But I do feel if they are charging $10, you are going to get your money's worth.  Even when it's $5, you are getting your money's worth.  Overall, this is my favorite place in Arizona.  If you love music and good vibes, this is where people go.  In the 9 years I've been coming here, I've never seen a fight break out.  I've never seen someone screw up my drink and I've never met a mean person.  I love this place more than words can tell.

Nestled between the Polazzo and the TI, Casio Royale is a breathe of fresh air when goofing around at the strip.  The drinks are dirt cheap, the slots are loose and cocktail waitresses actually pay attention to you.  Wife and I are not huge gamblers, we'll gamble $100 and make it last a very long time.  This place really earned our $100 .  The cocktail waitresses came around so frequently that at one point I was triple fisting Long Island Ice Teas.    The craps tables seemed to be where the fun was.  Lots of people huddled around screaming and shouting.  I was playing a game called Blackjack Switch which I enjoyed quite a bit.    The one grips I had, before 1am most of the games were $5.  Then they jacked the price to $10 tables.  I am not a fan of $10 tables.  If you don't have a lot of money and you want to have fun, step into this place for a little while, you won't regret it.

ATTENTION ALL BUFFET PEOPLE!!!!  I SPENT HOURS LOOKING FOR THE PERFECT BUFFET FOR MY ONE NICE BUFFET IN VEGAS.  WE HAVE A WINNER!!!  I have tried all the ones that are priced over 35 bucks.  I am not sure when i will be back in vegas and i only had one shot to get this right.  THEY HAVE SNOW CRAB AND KING CRAB.  THEY HAVE PRIME RIB, TURKEY, RACK OF LAMB, KOBE TENDERLOIN and some other various meats that didn't catch my eyes.  This place is HUGE.  This place on saturday night at 6:30 is PACKED.  Plan accordingly.  The line wrapped along outside the casino passed the bathroom.  I asked an attendant how long is the wait.  He said an hour.  I then found one of the coolest things ever.  If you are less than a party of 4 and over 21, they will seat you immeadiatly at the bar.  When we were done (90 minutes later) people who were in front of us in the massive line were still far away from getting in.  I only used caps in this review because a good buffet is judged by its crab legs and carving station.    I did do something new at a buffet. ,  one of my plates consisted of new food i have never tried. I cant remember what they were but i was impressed.  Bottom line, if you only get one expensive buffet in vegas and you want your moneys worth... This is your jackpot!!!  I am glad i can put the vegas buffet debate to rest. This is the only review you will have to read.

This is as good as it gets.  After I got married we spent part of our honeymoon in Vegas.  I did my research to find the best steakhouse in Vegas.  All signs pointed to here.    Wife and I dressed up nice and took a cab to the Wynn.  The atmosphere is out of this world.  We had a seat right along the waterfall and was treated to some of the trippiest artistic visuals I've ever experience (and I've visualized quite a bit if you know what I mean)    I got the ribeye and wife got the filet with bleu cheese.  We both made grunts and groans with every bite.  I was so impressed.  This was the best steak I have ever had.    Our meal cost a lot of money, but we knew that going in.  This was probably one of the most memorable dining experiences I have ever had.  I hope one day I can go back.

I feel bad giving this place such a low rating when one of my good friends fiance used to work here.  We went for my birthday and it was subpar.  The cut of steak was nice, the ambiance was nice,  the server was nice, but the food did not meet my standards.  When I am paying $40 for a steak, I want a $40 steak.   I have had better for $5.99 steak in Las Vegas.   I will not be dining here again because I am not getting my money's worth.   On a side note, the bartender Tatum was a joke.  No personality, no help what so ever.  When we asked for a recommendation on a glass of wine, she said "I don't know"  She took a while to greet us at the bar and it was not crowded.  I guess polishing glasses is more important.  Isn't the bar where the customer get's their first impression?

I love this place.  It's in the middle of nowhere and beautiful.  Great place to have a beer or burger.  Even better place to go at night with friends, build a fire and listen to some music.  Everyone in the valley has to go here at least once.

Holy cow this place rocks!  I have been eating my share of mexican food in arizona for quite some time.  It always tastes the same.  I came here and now I feel like I know what a carne asada burrito should taste like.  I was amazed.  I would like to continue to come here and try some other things.  The staff is also incredibly friendly.

Ten years ago, this place was the best.  Wife and I went here for Saturday brunch last month.  We arrived about 11am.  Paid $60 for unlimited mimosa and brunch.  All I wanted was bagels and lox, ham and an omelette.    The buffet was at the halfway mark meaning it wasn't going to close for another 4 hours.  They were out of bagels.  One of the stockers went to look for more bagels and she said they were out for the day.  I said to her "You mean there are no bagels in this entire casino and hotel?"  She said yes.  Went to the meat station, they were out of ham.  No more ham for the rest of the day.  Got an omelette and it was over cooked.    Bottom line, I would have asked for my $60 bucks back but we were so hungry.  The only reason this place got 2 stars is the mimosa service.  The guy who brings out mimosa ended up bringing us two pint glasses of champagne.  I even saw him fill up a pitcher full of champagne for a guy.  Now that's classy!    Bottom line, we won't be going there again when we go to Vegas.

I debated between giving this place either 3 stars or 4 stars.    I think if they needed to make 1 major improvement it would be a better system of getting cars into the establishment.  On a Saturday night, you will be waiting in line for 20 minutes.    The screens are fine.  I don't think it's going to get any better.  For $6 you get 2 movies.  You can bring your own food and drink.  The best part about it all, the snack bar is DIRT CHEAP.  You can get a jumbo sized popcorn for $5.  It doesn't get any better than that.  I wouldn't see a big budget action movie like Transformers here but a comedy or a popcorn flick, this is the best way to go.

I too get the monthly notifications that I have "exceeded my data" and I should upgrade.  I've done research... just IGNORE the email.  Not only are they just a gimmick to get you to fear them and hope you upgrade, NO ONE HAS A CAP ON THEIR SERVICE.  No one has ever been dropped as a customer just because they use their internet.  Like I said, I get these emails monthly.... If I look at the emails from a year ago, my data cap was higher.  It cracks me up that Cox implies an imaginary data cap that seems to decrease over the years, not increase.  Yet I've been paying the same price since I signed up.  Another funny thing, the number of gigs they say I use, is not accurate at all.  I installed a program that tracks how much data is sent around in the house and it doesn't come close to what they say we use.  One month we had a flood in our house and we were in a hotel for 3 weeks.  No one entered the house in those three weeks, let alone use the internet.  We still got an email notification stated we've gone over on our data... They claimed I used 350GB, according to the program I use to track my data, 5GB were transferred that month. What a scam!  The days cannot go fast enough to have google fiber come here.  That will put my headache to rest.

This place is G-H-E-T-T-O.  Ug,  I hate when my wife needs something late at night and this Fry's is my only resort.    Not to speculate, but I once saw a police van confiscating boxes of meat on a Saturday afternoon.  Maybe they were having a function, maybe the meat was bad.  I am not sure.   I do know however, their meat sucks!  No butcher here so I am not sure where it's packaged.  Also alot of their prepared food looks horrible and terribly un fresh.    I have nothing against Fry's but this one needs to shut down and soon.

Finally, a good place for Italian in this city.  The Firm has the BEST anti pasta salad I have ever had.  Never in my wildest dreams did I think about creating a salad like this.  Not much lettuce (not needed) roasted red peppers and rolls and rolls of yummy meat and cheese.  Not to mention, loaded with other goodies.  The dressing was fantastic.  Do yourself a favor and get this salad.  I am not a brushetta fan but this is phenomenal.  it's like a little pizza with cheese and balsamic vinaigrette.  It's not your traditional brushetta.    Wife had the chicken parm and I had the salmon picatta.  I was so impressed.  The portions were huge and the pasta complimented each dish.    Overall, you can taste the freshness.  Let me repeat that, YOU CAN TASTE THE FRESHNESS.  From the fresh pasta to the fresh tomatoes, it makes a difference.  It seems like everyone working there was family.  I talked to the owner and let him know what I think.  He was really interested in what I had to say and even asked me questions about my cooking I do at home.  This will be the place I bring out of town visitors.  The prices are more than reasonable and open for lunch and dinner.

This place turned to crap.  I remember when it first opened I loved this place.  I thought it was the best Chinese Food in town.  Flo took so much pride into her recipes.  I am not sure what went wrong.  I can't speak for all the servers there, but ours was terrible.  No personality just a freaking robot.  She came up to the table to greet us by saying "Are you ready to order"  How about some drinks lady?  I can get by with horrible service if the food is good, but the food was lousy.  We ordered chicken lettuce cups, 2 different types of soup and 2 entrees.  They tried to bring the soup out first but I asked them if we could get our app first.  The chicken that came with the lettuce cups was just the fatty pieces of the chicken they don't used with the entree, but all minced up.  The texture was gross and the flavor was bland.  The soups were the only reason this review got 2 stars.  Pretty good.  Wife had wonton soup and I had seafood shelfish soup.    The entrees sucked.  We shared Crispy Spicy Chicken which was more like Soggy Salty Chicken and the Orange Beef which was decent but soggy which made it not as good.  The server never came by again therefore I went the whole meal without anything to drink.  For sure we will not be coming back anytime soon.  I am not sure why this place stays busy, it's not worth my time.  If I wasn't so hungry, I would have returned the entrees and app.

I am so sick and tired of writing sub par reviews, I totally forgot I haven't Yelped Von Hanson's yet.  I've been here three times.  I am proud to say I live so close to it.  The meat here is amazing.  The butchers are friendlier than Disney World employees.    So far I've had the Ribeye's twice and filet's once.  What's great about this place is they don't pre cut a bunch of filets and sell them.  They ask how big you want it and go in the back and cut it.  The sausage selection is out of this world but I haven't had the time to make them.  They come frozen.  I've tried the bacon wrapped jalapenos stuffed with cream cheese and I was impressed.  What was strange about them was out of the 6 I bought, 1 ended up being one of the hottest things I have ever eaten.  In fact, I had to wait about 20 minutes before I could eat my dinner in order to enjoy it.  If you love cooking meat and have some extra money to spend, come out to Von's.  It's amazing.

This is my favorite place to see a movie.  It's clean and has lots of employees on hand at the snack bar.  I try to see movies in the Cine Capri but all the theaters in the building are state of the art.  Wonderful theater.

I love Chompies.  I really do.  Just stay far far away from this place on Sunday morning / afternoon.  The place is incredibly understaffed.  Table for 3 with a baby.  Told us it would take 15 minutes to sit.  It took more like 30.  We sit down.  We wait 5 minutes, no waitress.  A table next to us get's seated.  They get greeted, get their drinks then get their food order taken.  Then the same waitress comes over and takes our order.  So now we've waited 30 minutes to be sat and 15 minutes to have a waitress come to our table.  I ask for 1 scrambled egg to come for the baby as soon as it's ready.  10 minutes later a manager comes to the table with our egg.  It's undercooked and cold.  Very mushy.  You would think being the manager, he's qualified to take a look at a scrambled egg and know this is undercooked.  It was quite obvious.  I send it back.  20 minutes later our food comes out.  Still no egg.  I ask the food runner.  She comes back with an egg that cooked fine but freezing cold on a very hot plate (a very tell sign that these eggs have been sitting under a heat lamp for 15 minutes)  If the egg was for me, I would have sent it back.  But it's for a baby and I would have cooled it down before I fed him.    The food was great but never saw our waitress again after she took our food order.  If we wanted water or extra napkins, I got up and got it myself.    This isn't my first rodeo.  My wife had her baby shower here on a Sunday and we got the same crappy service.  I need to remind myself to stop coming here on Sundays.

I am not one to go to a super market and drink the day and night away.  However, some people enjoy pretending that this super market is a bar.    I love beer.  This place has a wonderful beer selection.  Now you can get beer in a growler.  I think that's the greatest gift to mankind besides world peace.  HOWEVER, when the bartender who's really a supermarket employee is a arrogant prick, I just have to take my business elsewhere.  I went in one night to get ingredients to make my wife a fantastic dinner.  I had two growlers in my cart and I was looking forward to filling them up.  I do not remember the jerk's name but he was overweight and had a tag that said something along the lines of "bar manager"  I asked him if I could sample a particular beer.  He said, "No" and walked away.  I asked why.  He said, 'This keg is to expensive, I don't give out samples."  Well that intrigued me more and told him I don't care how much it costs for a growler, I am willing to pay.  He said no again.  Let me add to the fact, he was not suggesting any other beers... just saying no.  Then I asked him about another beer, he said he doesn't pour that in growlers either.. I asked him why.  He sighed and began to ramble about particles and foam density and how it's a waste of his time and my time to try to fill it.  I brought up the "expensive" beer again.  He caved in and decided to give me a taste.  He then pointed at me and in a STERN manner told me, "He doesn't do pours of this beer for anyone, I am an exception."  Ooooh lucky me, a supermarket employee is allowing me to try something... it's in his job description.   Maybe he'll let me sample a grape in produce afterwards.   Bottom line, this supermarket employee/bar manager didn't want to help fill my growler.  He made me feel stupid and insignificant.  I threw a $5 dollar bill on his bar and thanked him for his time.  I proceeded to leave and drive 15 miles out of my way and went to Tops Liquor where they are happy to let you sample anything you ask them and answer any questions you may have about any of their products.    I am shocked how the tiniest bit of power a supermarket employee can feel with a nametag.  If I go to Wholefoods, I know I am going to spend more money than Fry's.  I am smarter than that.  I don't need a supermarket employee to try to make me feel stupid.  Someone needs to put that guy in his place.

This place is everything it's promised to be.  Greasy giant burgers.  How can some of these people give it 1 star because of it's grease?   It's the Heart Attack Grill!  If you don't like grease, stay away from it!  This was an amazing burgers and I really liked the fries.  Amazing cheese / meat ratio on a triple burger.  I finished it all but I didn't feel good afterwards.  ALSO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T OVERCHARGE YOU!  Waitress tried to charge me $10 more than what the total should be.  They count the total up in their head.

I would like the welcome this place as my new favorite hangout.  They have good wine and beer at unbeatable prices.  They also offer beer to go.  Normally restaurants that offer beer to go jack up the price, they do not.  Some beers are cheaper here than liquor stores.  The food is OUT OF THIS WORLD.  I think the most expensive item on the menu is $8.  They only have pizza and sandwiches.  Their french dip is the best I have ever had.  I ordered it with onions and peppers.  The dip was amazing.  I've also had the chicken sandwich twice and it's to die for.  This place is worth your time for either lunch or dinner.

$5 for a gyro is a good price.  I've had $10 gyro's taste worse than this.  That's why this place get's 2 stars.  It was nothing to write home about.  I will have to find the perfect gyro in Phoenix somewhere else.

This is the only place in Arizona to get genuine NYC bagels.  Their lox are also reasonably priced.  We bought 13 bagels and a half a pound of lox.  It came out under $20.  Their sandwiches looked great but I haven't tried one.  They were cheap.  Also, their Boars Head deli meat is cheaper here than the grocery store.  I will be driving out of my way to go here.  I only wish they had a better location, it's hidden and you can't see it from Tatum Blvd.

This place was not impressive.  Went in on a Monday night.  It was deader than disco.  With that being said, it took 15 minutes and twice to ask the hostess "where is our server"  After that, the service was great and they even offered us a free dessert.    I ordered the mahi mahi tacos which were good but RIDICULOUSLY overpriced.  There couldn't be more than 3 oz's of fish on the plate.  For $17 I expect more than 2 bites of fish.  My sister ordered the fajitas which she said weren't great.    Overall, I'd never go back there again.  I rather travel 2 miles more down the road and get Rubio's.  I know my Mexican food and this place is a giant N Scottsdale RIPOFF!

I finally got to try this place out.  After years of knowing about it and not doing anything about that I got my day.  Meat!  Lots and lots of delicious meat!    The salad bar was great, but I knew that I didn't come here for that.  I tried my best to be brief at the bar, but I couldn't resist.  Wonderful selection of veggies and cheeses.  Smoked salmon as well.  The hearts of palm were crunchy, the artichoke hearts were wonderful.  I was in love, but I was ready for meat.  First they clear your plate and throw down some side dishes.  Truthfully none of the sides looked tempting.  It was a small portion, but I bet if we wanted more, we'd get it.    The second you flip that button to allow meat, they come running over.  Skewers upon skewers of meat.  All of them were wonderful but some were better than others.  Stay away from the bacon wrapped filet and Parmesan crusted pork.  Both were not that good.  I also noticed that I prefer the meat when it's straight out of the flame.  If it sits around more than 15 minutes, it's not as good.  What I really liked about the place was the service.  Top notch.  They let us know right away that they work as a team.  So if we didn't see the server that first waited on us, we could ask anyone.  That was true.  There were about 6 people helping us at all times.  What I didn't like about the place was I felt a little rushed.  The rest of my party was done eating and I was still trucking.  Not only did they clear the table while I was still eating, the waiter even presented the desserts.  Dessert was the last thing on my mind while they were still bringing me meat.    However the dessert (if you can make it) were spectacular.  We had the creme brule and the molten chocolate cake.  Both were fabulous.  Overall, I'd come back here again and again and again.  It was wonderful

This place is awesome.  What's even better, I live walking distance from it.  If you've never had a pasty, do yourself a favor and try one.  These things are huge.  Lots of ingredients wrapped into a pastry shell and baked.  My God!  Drink selection is good here.  Bloody Mary bar on Sundays.  Check it out

Yup, the mothership has landed in Scottsdale.  Lo Lo's is incredible!  Wife and I went there at 4:30pm.  There were not many people there.  I had a wing and a breast and a waffle.  Wife had a breast and waffle and we shared a mac n cheese and a corn bread.  OMG!  This food is fantastic.    I never thought I would have the best fried chicken, corn bread, mac n cheese and waffles in my life all in one sitting.  The waffles were delicious.  I think they throw in a good amount of cinnamon for flavor.    The chicken pieces are huge and the breading is where it's at.  I for one will never be going back to KFC or Churches again.  This is the only place for chicken as far as I'm concerned.     They also have unlimited kool aid in mason jars.  I sucked down 2.

I guess before I moved here this was the place for live music.  Every time I talked to friends in Arizona, they were talking about their night at the Goat.  I finally moved out here and got to experience it first hand.  I was not impressed.    First off, the stage and sound is horrible.  It's small and the way the speakers and stage is crafted you don't hear everything.  If you want to hear a particular instrument, you have to move around.  The owner of the bar is a staple in live music in Tempe.  He's been around for a long time.  I feel that this place changed him.  The drinks are overpriced and the food is terrible.  I went once with my obvious pregnant wife and she ordered a coke.  It was small, loaded with ice and $2.50.  She drank it in one sip.  She went up to get a refill and it was another $2.50.  How can you charge $2.50 per sip of coke and charge $10 at the door?    One night I made the mistake of putting my tab on my credit card.  There was $30 worth of drinks on there that I didn't order.  I tried arguing with them and they didn't care.  I was floored.    The only time I will show up at this venue / restaurant again is if there is a band playing that I HAVE to see.  Thank God the Sail Inn is open again.  They treat their customers right, and they are grateful we show up.

I've used this place a few times.  Each time the price is good and the owner is a nice guy.    The last time I used this place the owner accused me of having a dog in the car.  I don't have a dog and if I did have a dog in the car, I would tell him.  There was hair in the back seat but I was never in the back seat nor did I bother to check the back seat.  My wife and I used the car for a weekend trip to Vegas.    Rather than "the customer is always right" routine, the owner decided to dig deeper into me and continue to accuse me.  He got me boiled to the point where I started yelling.  That's how bad it got.    After this incident, I don't think I can justify to go back here again.  It was obvious the owner was in a bad mood but to accuse me of having a dog in the car, that's just insane.

Let me start this review out by saying I am an audio snob.  I think a music venue will make it or break it by their sound system.  You can tell The Compound really invested a good amount of time and money into their sound system.  Watching the sound man run around the place with a digital equalizer shows that The Compound knows what they are doing.  With that being said....  I walked into The Compound not knowing what to expect and not hearing any reviews.  I just know that they were about to bring some of my favorite national acts to Scottsdale.  I wanted this place to be great but being in N Scottsdale, I had my doubts.  I was wrong.  First impression was a nice one.  Lots of parking, clean outdoor area and someone to open the door for me.  I paid for my ticket (ticket prices are not bad if you are to compare this place to the Marquee) I immediately hit up the bar and I had to do a double take.  Were these prices correct?  I am in N Scottsdale and I am about to pay $3 or a beer?  My wife is about to get a margarita for only $3?  To good to be true.    The drink selection is all over the place and CHEAP.  That is a major bonus that The Compound cannot change if they want to stay in business.  There is nothing worse than paying an arm and a leg for a concert ticket only to get raped by drink prices.  KUDOS.  If drinks were expensive here, I would rationalize going to some of these upcoming shows.   The place was packed for a Garaj Mahal show (awesome jazz band) I was not a fan of the way the tables were set up.  Nice size stage in a room filled with tables.  Not much room to dance.  It didn't look encouraged.  I was told later that at more "dance" shows, they clear a good amount of tables.  Luckily a party left leaving a table open in the front row right in the corner.  PERFECT!  I asked the hostess if we could sit there and she immediately went over and cleared the table for us.  I was impressed!  After reading some other Yelp reviews, the main drag seems like the service.  I can't agree but I can't disagree.  Our waiter was on us like white on rice which got really annoying but by the end of the show, we could never find him.  I heard other friends from other tables complaining about the service as well.  If I had my way, I'd sit at the table and go to the bar to order drinks, but I am not that guy who's going to steal a waiters table.  For four people, we ordered 5 apps and 1 sandwich.  All of the dishes were different from other restaurants we frequent and quite impressive.  The Napa Crisp stood out the most.  A crispy wheat pita topped with apricot, brie, jalapenos (not spicy) and a fantastic lime honey jelly.  Another winner was the fried green tomatoes.  I'd stay away from the crap empanada.  We also got the Kung Fu Girl with Ahi Tuna (amazing blend on veggies and unique dressing) and the Cuban Sandwich (not a traditional Cuban but a decent soft, tender sandwich)   Overall, four people who were drinking, 3 apps, 1 salad and 1 sandwich came to $75.  That was $75 less than what we thought the final tab was going to be.    The Compound would have gotten 5 stars if the service was better, but overall I was impressed.  I am so relieved there is a place in the valley that is a great place to see live music.  I only hope the best for this place.  If they keep getting in the acts that they are getting in March, (Karl Denson, Emmit Nershi Band and Martin Sexton) then I will continue to keep coming.

Let me start off by saying, I walked in to this establishment wanting to give this place 5 stars.  I want it to succeed.  I wanted a damn good burger.  I've eaten Five Guys before on the east coast.  I am no stranger to their wonderful concept.  Fresh products and amazing taste at a reasonable price.  I've eaten some amazing burgers at other Five Guys places.  Every burger you order is a double.  It says on the menu "cheeseburger" but it's a double cheeseburger.  Also a large fry will feed 2 (I'll get to that later)  Also all the toppings are included in the price.  Their toppings are about as generous as Subways toppings.  Plenty of variety.  Both the wife and I had a bacon cheeseburger with grilled onions and mushroom, lettuce and mayo and ketchup.  It's about a 10 minute wait for your food.  They have peanuts to keep you entertained while you wait.    As I rip into this greasy bag of goodness, I notice that my burger looks terrible.  I mean worse that any burger I have ever had at an greasy fast food joint.  The bottom bun is ripped to shreds, the toppings are falling everywhere including the meat and cheese.  Did the cook miss and not bother to fix his mistake?  At first I thought they served me a single burger but then under all the cheese I see another patty the size of a silver dollar.  I was so hungry and with my family, I was not in the mood to complain (oh and I can complain) I ate that burger in pieces because it was impossible to pick up.  I was so sad.  My wifes burger was fine.  She loved it but has had better.  The fries are the only reason Five Guys got 2 stars.  They are fresh cut and cooked to perfection.  Best part about them, they fill up the container then add an additional scoop in the bottom of the bag.  Overall, I am going to give this place one more shot.  One more opportunity to show me why this place is Zagat rated.  If it doesn't you better believe this time I am going to get my money back.  Let me know how your experience went here.  I hope it was an isolated incident.

When you have the corner restaurant on Mill and University, you better bring it.  With that being said, I think this place has a long way to go and I think it's going to close down before that time comes.  It's a great concept.  I can imagine it being a decent place for a night life.  I wasn't there for that.  I was there at noon on a Monday.  Bad idea?  My wife, mom and I ordered the cheese burger.  How can you go wrong?  My wife went to order it medium rare and got a disclaimer from the nice but incredibly forgetful waitress (I'll get to that later) that medium rare is very rare here.  She talked her into ordering it medium.  I still stuck with medium rare.  My burger came out like a hockey puck while my mom and wife's came out medium well.  I sent mine back.  My dad ordered biscuits and gravy, they looked good but my dad felt like the gravy came out of a can.  The waitress was a nice girl.  I can imagine working there she might get a lot of stuck up and rude clientele.  What I don't understand is she would suggest something, we'd get it and then she'd forget it.  Eg: side salad for my wife, order of fries for my dad, swiss on my moms burger.  All were forgotten and brought out when reminded.  There were maybe 2 other tables there and 2 waitresses on duty.  She wrote everything down.  I guess she had a long weekend.  Good thing her personality kept her from getting a full tip.  Bottom line, this food is terrible.  The service is terrible.  This place has nothing going on for itself.  From reading Daniel R's review, I can see that this place may redeem itself in a nightlife situation but I'll never find out for myself.

Went in 15 minutes before closing time.  All the lights were on and the sign that said "open" was still on.  Was told by a snotty employee that they were closed.  I asked why the lights and sign were still lit.  She turned them off when I said that.  I asked her what her manager would think if she knew they were closing early.  She said she wouldn't care.   I walked out and now said my peace about this place.

I honestly think this place got some negative attention before the current owner came into place.  The owner of the shop Rob was incredibly informative, attentive and sincere about my visit.  I was surprised the second time I came in, both Rob and his associate Droo knew who I was.  This place is awesome.  They have an amazing selection and competitive prices.  I researched the product they sold me and it was cheaper than some bigger online stores.    Overall, I will be loyal to Up in Smoke.

I am long overdue for a review of Goddard.  I really wish I knew about Yelp when I was looking for a daycare.  We went through two other schools before we found Goddard two years ago.  My son graduated their pre school class and my daughter has been coming here since she was a baby.  The staff lead by their fearless leader Mr Todd is beyond top notch.  How he knows every child's name and parents name is beyond me.  However, every morning when we walk through the door we are greeted with a smile and a joke or two.    The care they give my two year old daughter is amazing.  The system they use to connect with the parents is great.  Throughout the day we will get a picture or two and a full report via email at the end of the day.  They do not provide breakfast or lunch but I prefer that.  I like to know where my child's food comes from.  They do provide healthy snacks a few times a day.  I am 99.9% certain nothing comes out of a can.  I challenge any parent to find another 5 star review of a day care program in this area.  All local schools have some sort of mention of staff drama or high turnover of staff.  As far as I know, Mr Todd and Ms Darlene are the ONLY ones to run this school.  I highly suggest any parent who is looking for a safe and caring environment for their child try Goddard.  As far as I am concerned, they were a God-sent to us.  Thanks Goddard.  On a side note, if any parent wants more confirmation this review is legit, please feel free to mention my name and I will leave work to come to Goddard to introduce you to my happy daughter.

JACKPOT!  This is what I love about the Chandler / Tempe area.  I have yet to have bad Italian.  Thursday night at 6pm, THIS PLACE IS PACKED.  I think we were the last table to be seated before they went on a wait.  The service was excellent.    The food was OUTSTANDING!  I was starving when I came in, I left stuffed!    Shrimp and Shells and Veal Picatta and Calamari.  All of it was FANTASTIC.  This will be the place I bring people when they come to visit.

Mothers day brunch was okay but not amazing.  If they charged less than $55 a head, it would have got an extra star.  1 Star for movement and organization of the staff.  It was a very long line but we made it up front in about 30 minutes.  Bussers and servers worked very well as a team to get plates cleared, get people out and people in.    1 Star - The desserts.  I am not a dessert man at buffets.  I do not have a sweet tooth, but this place rocked the desserts.  I was impressed with the selection and care the dessert makers had with their dessert.  Negative star for the layout of the buffet.  Omelette station in the middle of the dessert bar?  I totally missed it and I really wanted some eggs.  No butter by the crablegs and lobster?  It was on the other side of the bar and not labeled.    Negative star for putting shitty lobster on the menu.  It was practically unedible.  I have no idea how to describe it.  It was like overcooked then flash frozen then reheated in a microwave then chilled.  Definitely the lowest point that was our biggest selling point for going.  Bottom line, Mothers Day 2016?  No way Jose.  Random Friday night if I am gambling and have an extra $60 to spend on dinner?  Sure!

It's due time I write a review for this place.  I come here and pick up food twice a week.  Like others say about it, I crave it hours after I am done eating.  I always get the same thing because I love it.  The sliced beef soup.  I am not sure why.  I am not one to eat the same things all the time, however... this is my favorite meal of the past 6 months.  My wife loves the chicken stir fry.  Yesterday we tried the dumplings and they were splendid as well.   This place also always has a crowd.  It's not like Jong Wah where you're lucky to find one person dining in.  The family that runs the place is very friendly and accommodating.  They remember me and my son when we go in there.  Some conversation is struck up with the owner, he is a very nice man.  My son loves watching them make the noodles, they always smile and wave to him.  He also LOVES the smoothies.  SLICED BEEF TIP OF THE DAY Word of advice with the slice beef soup for take out... take all the noodles and put them in a bowl.  Spoon out all the veggies and beef (I also add a marinated egg every time) now you have a cup of broth.  Add one packet of soy sauce, a tsp of sirachi and half a ramekin of the homemade chili oil they give you.  Stir it up and pour over the noodles.  It will have a tiny kick but will not be over bearing.  Do not try this if you don't like spice.

I think this place was pretty good.  I'm an east coaster.  I usually cook my own shellfish when I get a craving for it but this time I felt like getting some in public.  The patio is smoking which for us smokers is a rare treat.  They had poker going on that night.  They basically took up the entire patio but they seemed like wonderful people (I love to play free Texas Hold Em but the wife was with me) they were polite and having fun.  The service was EXCELLENT.  Two bartenders on that night.  They seemed incredibly busy with the poker people but they always came and checked on us.  Never once did we feel ignored.  To be honest, it was the best service I've had in quite some time.  Extra bonus points seeing they running around for the poker people.  The food was outstanding.  I had crab cakes and they were AMAZING.  My wife had the talipa and it was tasty.    Overall, this is my kind of place and I would come here again.  If time allows it, I'd love to come back to play poker.

I love how one review of this place was deducted stars cause people were smoking outside.  Duh!  It's a bar in Tempe.  People have a tendency to smoke while drinking at a concert.  Get over it!  I love this place.  I've been twice on Thursday night to see this amazing Grateful Dead cover band called Xtra Ticket.  They play there every Thursday night at 9:10pm.    What's great is before 9:10pm drinks are two for one.  Usually we stock up.  The sound is AMAZING here.  AMAZING.  The staff has always been more than nice.  Typically going out of their way to be friendly.    Drinks are cheap.  Good beer for cheap = winner!

I've moved around quite a bit.  Finding the right barber by your home is very important.  I am so happy for this place.  Family owned and operated.. Quality of products and cleanliness are above average.  They do an amazing job on me and my sons head.    Even if they doubled their prices and I moved 30 miles away, I'd still come here.  They are the best in the state.

The manager of the resturant gave me a call after reading my review of this place.  That blew my mind.  In the years I've writing reviews for Yelp, I never had an actual establishment call me to personally apologize for the terrible service.  He said next time I am in town I should try them again.   That I will definitely do.

This place is great.  I am not sure if this place reads Yelp reviews or what... but anything negative that was said about this place is not the case today.  The place was spotless.  very very clean.  The people behind the counter were incredibly friendly and attentive of the customers that came through the door.  I was immediately greeted upon entering (even when he was helping another customer) and after ordering, my food was promptly made.    The bagels were great.  Nice size.  Crispy on the outside, doughy in the middle.  Significantly larger than other bagel stores.  The lox were fresh.  The cream cheese you can tell is homemade.   Overall, this will be the place I get bagels from now on.  This east coast Jew has found a winner.  Thank you bagel man.

I only write reviews on Yelp to help people save their money.  Ten bucks for a small sandwich and a drink.  "The Bobbie" which is supposed to be their signature sandwich is cold shredded turkey (maybe a 2 oz portion at most) cold stove top stuffing and cold cranberry sauce smushed in a rubbery piece of bread.  No sides!  If my co worker wasn't the one who picked this up and I was eating it inside the restaurant, I would march up to the counter and ask for a refund.    My toddler could make this better in his sleep.    Of all the years working in Scottsdale, this is hands down, the biggest ripoff for lunch.  How they are still in business after a year is beyond me.  GARBAGE.

I danced between 2 stars and 3 stars with this review.  I'll get to why I only gave it 2 in a minute.  My dad was REALLY excited to try this place out.  Asian buffets are his thing.  I like them too but I prefer upscale ones.  This one is upscale.  If you have read any of my other reviews you'll know I am a buffet junkie.  I love them and I will honor and cherish them as long as they take care of me.  First off, this is the cleanest buffet in Arizona.  Hands down!  It's nice, spread out with seating and incredibly nice decor.  The layout of the food is great.    With that being said, the dishes are your standard Asain fare with a twist.  You can tell the cooks take pride in the preparation and ingredients.  THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS EVERYTHING IS COLD ONCE YOU GET IT TO YOUR TABLE.  All the food was incredibly luke warm.  If it was hot, it would have tasted better.  My dad went up to the manager and told them this.... Their response.....  IT'S THE A/C in the building.  That has to be the biggest crock of shit I have ever heard in my entire life.  I've been to plenty of buffets in the Valley and not once was the food cold.  They ran the A/C too. All the dishes were pretty cold, a health inspector would have a field day with this place.   Now that I got that out of the way... The sushi layout was OUTSTANDING.  The fish was really fresh and they had almost any roll I could imagine.  I would have liked to have tried the crab legs but there were maybe 10 of them sitting in a bath of luke warm water.  It was like that the entire hour I was there.  The oysters were great..  Please keep in mind... I NEVER EAT OYSTERS AT A BUFFET.  It's the one thing I won't trust.  These were cold and fresh and delicious.  If you can eat $20 worth of sushi on one plate, this is the place for you.. You will get your money's worth.  The bottom line is this place is worth trying once.  After that, I don't think you can justify paying $20 for lukewarm food.  Judging by the managers response, this is an issue that will not go away anytime soon.  Also, our server was a real ass.  I am not sure if he just hates his life or was having a bad day, but he was pissed about something.  He slammed my drink down each time I asked for a refill and he was pissed that he had to bus his own tables.  If I did decide to go back here, I would ask for another waiter.  Also this place was dead on a Sunday at 6:30pm.  I don't think this place is going to make it.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE HAVE A WINNER.  I saw this place while driving a friend home.  I hooked a sharp right to get into the parking lot not even thinking I might hit a car.  I am a wing man.  I love wings.  I will eat the shit out of wings.  I haven't really found a place that have the whole package... until now.  I ordered for me and my family, 15 wings (garlic pepper and honey habenero) a 3 piece catfish dinner (which was enough for 4 people) fried mac n cheese kids meal and honey biscuits.  Where do I start?  First off we didn't eat there.  I brought it home.  I thought it would loose flavor and quality by the time I got it home.  IT DIDN'T.  They did an AMAZING job packaging it.  Everything was packaged separate so no food touched another food.  That included the fries that came with it.  Even the fries lived!  The honey biscuits are OUT OF THIS WORLD.  AMAZING GOOEY GOODNESS.  I will order a bunch of those for thanksgiving if I have to.    The garlic pepper wings were some of the best wings I have ever had in my entire life.  The seasoning was a dry rub.  They tasted nothing like I've ever tasted before.  The honey habenero were not as hot as I would have imagined but the flavor was top notch.  My wives catfish was AMAZING.  The breading and seasoning was perfect.    I think I know why everything tasted so good....  The cooks behind the counter knew that preparing the food was NOT A RACE.  They took their time and made sure everything came out at the same time and went the extra mile to make sure they did it right.  Everyone who worked behind the counter were so polite and informative.  They let my know how my order was coming almost every minute.. "I dropped the catfish, it will take 2 minutes to cook, then I'll sauce the wings"  Meanwhile someone was bagging up all the condiments and sides so they were ready to go before the food was ready.  I could tell by all the metal bowls and sauce containers with handwritten labels, everything is made in house and from scratch.  Nothing looked like it was ordered from a supplier.  They took ingredients and made it from scratch.  The price was reasonable and the portions were amazing.  My wife took the other half of her catfish to work with her.  Bottomline, I will return.  I will support this company.  I will tell my friends about it.  Please go here and enjoy it!

This place is spectacular.  It's as family owned and operated as you get.  They take pride in their food and they love compliments.  To me, this is comfort food.  The sweet potatoes and collard greens are worth a try.  The cakes are addicting... the chicken... well, don't get me started on the chicken, just look at the stars I rated them.

This place is great.  Amazing deals.  Half off Teppanyakki.  The drinks and food were great.  What I didn't care for was the timing.  I understand that they want to fill a table before they have someone come out and cook the food.  We have two very small children.  We know weekend children dining etiquette (get your ass in the restaurant early and get the hell out before it get's busy) The problem was they kept us waiting for so long in between apps, salads and soups hoping someone would come in before it's time to teppan.  About 20 minutes after ordering our food and getting our salad and soup a party of three came in and sat next to us.  Now we have to wait for them to order their drinks, eat their apps etc before we can get our main course!  40 minutes into dinner, no entrees and our kids are getting cranky.  All of this was quashed once our Teppan guy showed up.  He was entertaining and energetic.  Great with the kids.  The bill came and it was next to nothing.  Hands down, cheapest dinner in a long time.  We will return.

I was just refused service because I had my two kids with me at 5pm.  First they wanted us to wait until a reservation came.  We said we prefer not to because we have two kids with us.  The last time we waited for a reservation to show up, it was a two hour dinner.  They sat us.  Minutes later the reservation came and we were asked to sit with them.  We said we prefer not to because we're sitting and the "reservation" obviously wants a kid free evening.  We were essentially told we had to move because they didn't want to clean two tables.    I've been to this place 4 times now.  Past experiences have shown that when we wait for their "reservation" we are sitting at the table for two+ hours and our kids go nuts.  It ruins my families evening and the other parties evening.  My family takes over half the table.  Its not like we're killing them.  There was NO ONE in the restaurant.    So we were told to leave because we didn't want to move.  This place obviously cares more about the numbers than the customers experience.    I am floored.  My family loved this place.  How do you explain to your son that we were kicked out of his favorite restaurant because mommy and daddy didn't want to spoil another party of fours evening?

This place is long overdue for a review from me.  NB Tae Kwon Do is an amazing place.  It is run by two brothers and their mother.  The vibe here is community.    I am not an expert at Tae Kwon Do but I am a master parent.  My son was 4 1/2 when he started and had a horrible temper and enjoyed hitting his sister.  My son has been coming here close to six months now and he doesn't hit his sister and is a much better student at school.  What more could I say?  If I read my testimony I would ask, "Where do I sign?"  The walls and counters are filled with trophies and childrens report cards, letter from teachers etc.  i am not sure how the adult classes are but most of the adult students are incredibly active here in the childrens classes.  They also appear to be capable to kicking my butt.  Children arrive early to class with smiles on their faces and leave late to play with the other children.  The parents have been so welcoming of me and are incredibly friendly to talk to.  The classes have set times but the instructors do not end class until they are confident the kids got what they came to learn.  I like that.  Overall, this is the spot if you are interested in getting your kids in martial arts.  In a way, I owe them my sanity.  I was unable to control my sons negative attitude.  Having him come 2-3 times a week for class has taught him so much more than I could.  Kudos to NB!  We will be lifetime members.

My fellow Michiganders, Run, don't walk.  This place nailed it on the head.  It was a simple formula that no other Coney in this state was able to do.  Take everything that people want from a Michigan Coney Island and mirror it here in the desert.  The coney dog and baby greek were spot on.  If I closed my eyes, I would think I was back in Michigan.  Kudos Detroit Coney.  This place makes me homesick.

I've been here at least 10 times now.  I try to bring someone new every time.  CONSISTENTLY, this food is excellent.  What blows my mind more than anything else about Detroit Coney is the staff.  From the big chief to the crew that cooks the food.  Everyone is wonderful and treats you like family.  I've never felt that an employee feels like an "employee" I think they feel like they are part of something bigger.  As a business owner myself, I try to make my employees feel the same way.  They are bigger than just one of my employees, they are part of this business.......    The man in charge treats everyone like he's known them for years.  Whether he genuinely remembers me and my family when we walk in those doors, he sure makes us feel like we're a long distant family member that he hasn't seen in years.  It feels good to walk into an establishment and get that kind of attention.  He's upfront, honest and OPEN to any and all suggestions.  He wants nothing more than the spirit of Michigan to creep into this desert town.  As for naysayers who may bitch that this establishment isn't the real deal, that it doesn't serve breakfast, that the prices are higher here than in Michigan.... use some common sense!  It's a small place.  All roads that lead to Phoenix have signs that say "steep grades"  To a truck driver, that means higher price of delivery.  To a business owner, that means, cost of goods go up.  Ever wonder why huge bands NEVER play Arizona?  This restaurant is practically importing 50% of it's menu to give his customers the food they are unable to get ANYWHERE else in this state.  It's going to cost more.  As a business owner, I wrap my brain around their price on goods and salary vs profit.    Detroit Coney Grill I would imagine is just a stepping stone to a bigger picture.  Something tells me one day Arizona will get the full blown Coney it deserves and it's all thanks to Detroit Coney Grill.  If I was a millionaire, I'd beg DCG to let me invest.

I decided to give this place a review after my second visit.  New Years day, no one except employees were there and they still screwed it up.  I order the black and bleu burger for my second time.  This time they forgot to season the burger so it was pretty bland.  The bun appeared to be stale and cold as it was crumbling apart at the bottom making the burger messy to eat.  The guy at the counter who kept sneezing in his hand and wiping it on his jeans rung my daughters order up wrong so it had to be remade.  I didn't bother telling them about my burger because I knew the kids could not sit still much longer.    What irked me the most (besides the sneezing counter guy) was when I was ordering the food for the kids, I was offered fruit, applesauce, fries or sweet potato fries as their side options.  I picked sweet potato fries for both.  I was not informed that there was an up charge.  I didn't realize it until I checked my receipt.  That ticks me off to no end.  Bottom line, if you have a empty restaurant (and I mean empty) and a fully stocked up staff, nothing should go wrong.  This place is in a good area and the prices are high.  I probably won't return because I spent a good amount of money and got very little satisfaction.
