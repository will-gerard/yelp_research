Oh my, I just have to say that this place is a knock your socks kind of meal.  I had the Big Jim, the flavor and and taste is insane..... This reminds me of one of those spots you run into in California.  Trust me, you will not be disappointed....

I am going to give the Arizona Mills store a 1 star for their lack of customer service and willingness to even try and work with you as a customer (just look at yourself as a sell) .  I had a product that was still under warranty and I had no luck dealing with them at the store level even after showing them the receipt that proved that the item was purchased at their store...   Thank God that they have a strong Corporate backing that handled the problem within days..  I will give their product 6 stars and I will give their Corporate management team 6 stars..   If you would like to purchase a lovesac item, I would personally go to the Scottsdale location and completely avoid the Arizona Mills location at least until they have a more competent staff, Manager and Asst Manager included...  Thank you kindly!!!!!

Ok ok ok ok, I am 46 years old, I have had quite a few pies in my life, but that Apple Pie with the crumbles on top is something like I have never had before in my life.  The flavor that you get after that first bite is ridiculous.  When I need sweets in my life, this is where I will go.  So, from now on at all pot lucks, parties and all get togethers I will have your pie in hand!  Thank you, now I'll be over here eating more pie!!!!

This review is for the central location not the Scottsdale location.  I have been to this establishment several times and have not had a good experience yet, but I kept giving them the benefit of the doubt, but last night was the final straw...  One time I went to the establishment to have some of their Red Velvet Cake, before ordering the cake I asked the rude waitress if they had some cake before I even ordered dinner, she replied yes, and guess what after dinner I ordered some Red Velvet Cake for the table and she informed me that they were out and she was sorry, Really!!!!!!   Last night i dropped by and was going to get some Cake for the house and now I guess that they do not do orders to go, just 1 slice of cake really, they are to busy to box up 1 slice of cake.  If you want to have chicken and waffles just go and take the trip to Scottsdale/Thomas southeast corner, no rude waiters and waitress' and the best of customer service.......

AVOID, terrible customer service, took the family through the drive thru and when we got home had the complete wrong order.  I know, I should have checked the order but we were the only people there, LOL, which makes it that much worse!!!!!

Negativo,  I guess that they are good if you like hard, stale donut with no flavor, If you want  a good donut just make the trip to BOSA on Glendale....

This place is something else, I spent about 40minutes in the store and not 1 person even said hello to me, so with that being said there are so many other shops in the valley, don't even waste your time with this one....

Wow, let me start by saying thank you for understanding customer service.....  If you are in the market for a pool table or any other fun things for your man cave, make sure that you come here first.  Their prices are the very best that I have found in the valley, bar none.  If you have any questions they will walk you through the whole process and they have a ton of knowledge.  I could not be more thrilled about my new pool table....  Whats next on my list, I think it may be that really nice shuffle board!!!!!!

Walked into this store just pricing some furniture out. They offered the best deal the valley could offer. I would suggest that anyone looking for a lazyboy recliner go to this store and they will personally fit you into the piece that's for you. I gave them my price range and they walked me to the piece of furniture that I had been looking for.  If you go to this location look for Tiffany Santini.

The Bobbi, nothing special, just a little underwhelming for a cold sandwich.  The meatball sandwich, just a flavorless sandwich.  If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!!

I have seen Arauna 3 times, and he has totally outdone himself each time I have gone to him..  I started off with a original Tautau and he made me so comfortable that I decided to get a half sleeve.  If you want compliments on your tatoo everywhere you go, don't look any further!!!!!!!

Food was a 4, but the service from Teasha was a little bit sideways (literally) she did not walk past the corner of the table.  I don't think she smiled once.  We were sbout to leave based on her bad attitude.  The gentleman that brought our food was more attentive than Teasha was.  So a bit of advice, if she comes to your table, leave or ask to be seated in another servers section, trust me..
