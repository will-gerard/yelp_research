It was okay. We ended up here, instead of burgatory. Ordered fried pickles, expecting the smaller sliced pickles fried, like every other place in the world. Came out as fried pickle spears..., batter pieces fell off immediately after one bite and all that is left is a warm pickle. Bun on burger looks delicious, but wasn't. Kind of boring and so was the burger.

My husband and I had brunch here. So awesome! He ordered the chicken and waffles and he LOVED it. I ordered the Oscar Benedict. Delish. The service was phenomenal.

It's been tough since most of the Krispy Kreme donut shops were closed in Arizona. There were no donut shops in Laveen until this one opened up. It's amazing!! My favorite donut place now. Wide variety, always fresh and soft. I am a huge fan on creme filled (not custard) and they have a delicious one. Also, they have a maple bacon donut. Enough said!!
