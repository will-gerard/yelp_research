Really good food! Pad thai - hot, egg soup, and red curry. Server was very nice. She even brought our take home to our car when we forgot to take it with us on the way out.

My first time here and not at all impressed. My wife and a couple of friends told me to try it so we did. A few notes for anybody wanting to try  PRO Portions are good  Servers are nice  CON: Food does not really have any taste. I had to put a whole lot of salt and pepper on everything.  Clean up service kept on taking our plates while we are still eating from them. This older shorter fellow with hat and glasses kept circling around our table every two minutes to take our stuff. It got so bad that while my wife was boxing the items and leaving some food for my daughter that we had to yell at him to stop as we are not done.  Please do yourselves a favor learn to be patient with your customers. We were about to leave anyway it was just a matter of waiting one more minute for us to  completely finish and leave with a positive outlook on this place rather than trying to clean up early and create a negative experience for us.

Best seafood place in AZ. Trifecta 1! Sauce is great mix of their sauces. A definite must try for any seafood lover.   Preprare to get your hands dirty but it will be worth it.
