I enjoyed Tom's Tavern.  They sat our large group in a busy walk way and that is the reason for 3 not 4 stars...If there are larger groups don't put them in the path of all the employees.  I had the BLT and it was good ...  Not the best but for the price and the location good. I'd add more meat but that is just me :)  It is a busy atmosphere and a popular place during the day ... It is not your typical tavern so don't let the name fool you ... it is not dark, smelly and full of the "regulars".  It is good dinning at a fair price. I will return.  2-14-2013 Received email from their customer service team and I added a star for their oustanding customer care and follow-up!

My wife and I were craving some Korean BBQ to celebrate my birthday dinner.  We received a hot tip about Takamatsu and decided to give it a try.  It is a fairly casual environment and the number of regulars encouraged me.  We also saw a few big groups maybe a family event or a bday party.  Another good sign!    Food:  We ordered a couple of Korean BBQ classics and grilled them up at our seat.  We also tried some of the sushi, the Salmon very buttery and fresh.    Environment: It appears that this restaurant has been there for a while and is in need of a "makeover."  Although it needs some updates it adds the traditional feel and experience.  Service: Great service! We were greeted right away seated and ordered drinks.  Our server knew when to swing by to see if we needed anything but did not hover or ask us 50 million times if we are OK.  I like that in services ... there but not there.  I would recommend this for date night, special occasion or just a fun night out with some very good food and great service!  We will repeat!   -AEC

Average everyday critic   This is an awesome venue!  You can enjoy lunch, dinner or just happy hour!  A couple of co-works and I had lunch here yesterday.  And it was hmmm good!  Food:  The food is awesome here!  I have eaten here numerous times and I not been disappointed with any of my meals.  Yesterday, I had the fish and chips and the outside breading was crisp with a nice crunch.  The fish was moist and not "fishy" at all.   And their tarter sauce, rich, think and very flavorful.  I am not sure what they do to their fry's but they are some of the best I have ever had!  Environment: This is a fun place!  Loud enough to be fun but not too loud where you can't think and conduct a business meeting.  It is a bit dark, but what do you expect from a brewpub.  I would not say this is a kid's joint but if you are outside it is more accommodating for a family.  Service:  Our server was awesome!  She was on the ball with our order and getting our food out in a very timely manner!  Knew when we need a beverage refill but did not "bug" us.  All in all, I would recommend Four Peaks to anyone!  Even if you don't drink beer it is a great venue and AWESOME food.  -AEC

Today I had a lunch meeting at Olive and Ivy. The atmosphere is fun and open. It was not too crowded but busy which is always a good sign.  We sat up at the bar to enjoy the taller seats and watch the world go by.  Our server / bar tender did an excellent job and I would return just to set in her section again.  I had the flat bread!  I would recommend this to anyone as it was loaded with flavor. Their opener of fresh bread and pesto is to die for ... I had a lot of carbs but it was all in the name of good food and of course business.  I look forward to my next visit.  This is another one of the Fox Restaurant Concepts and they are always a fine place to eat!

This review is with a heavy heart as it would be my first extremely negative review.    While sitting at the drive though I could hear music playing on the other end as the person on the other side was attempting to take my order.  I pulled up to the first window and the music is still blasting off the individuals phone.  I could also hear a lot of "rowdy" noise from behind the window as his co-workers were singing and play around with each other.  I paid and proceeded to the next window.  The worker started to hand me the drinks.  As he passed over one of the drinks the lid was filled with overflow soda and as he handed it to me tips the cup so it spills all over my shirt sleeve.  He looked right at me then turned and walked away.  I requested some napkins to clean up the spill. This seemed to put him off and he tossed me a couple of napkins with no apology nor eye contact.  We received our order. I Iooked in the bag, there was no straws, napkins nor sauce for the chicken nuggets.  I asked to speak with the manager.  Some young 18-19 year old man came to the window with an attitude and said "what do you want?"  I walked him though my experience and he said, " there is nothing i can do."  I asked for his managers number.  He said he is the General Manager and that he can't give me the owners name or any other number to call.  I said this is unacceptable and I needed someone to address the spilled soda and the pure lack of customer service.  He said i could call his HR department and that he would have to take the food back and give me a refund before he would provide me with the number ...  Really!!!  I said no, I am keeping the food with three hungry kids in the back.  He then said, "we make enough money that losing you as a customer is ok with me." WOW!  I drove away and vow to never ever return to this McDonald's and maybe the entire brand!  This will bum my kids out but In and Out is closer to our house and they know how to treat a person.  Just because it is fast food does not mean that the service can treat customer this way.  To the owner, who makes enough money, maybe this be the wake up call you need to inspect your business and who is representing you! ...  My guess is the culture of this franchise is a direct reflection of the owner.  Culver's, In and Out, Wendy's, Jack in the Box, Burger King ...  Here we come!

Wanted Sushi and this is literally the only sushi place in downtown Phoenix ... It was a great atmosphere and quiet enough for a working business lunch with a colleague.  Highly recommend this establishment!  Mattie was our server and he did a great job and recommended outstanding dishes!  He accommodated our need to stay passed their normal lunch hour!  I look forward to my next sushi craving!

This is a great restaurant!  Part of the fox restaurant concepts which are all good places for food and beverage. Busy atmosphere but still accommodates a business lunch!  Great place for happy hour and it is close to the stadiums and walking distance from my place of work.  Tiffany is a great server friendly and always on her game.  The food was outstanding and I recommend their Italian sandwich!  I look forward to me next business lunch or happy hour at the "butcher"

This place has gone down hill ... Pizza a solid OK and the customer service and polite employees a 0!   There is better pizza pie out there... don't waste time and money.

I can not express my satisfaction with Shane and his team of professionals.  My RV blew the radiator the morning I was going to take it camping.  I searched in a panic for someone to help me...  Shane and his team stepped up to the plate, came and got my RV, repaired it, and had it back in my driveway the same day!  Not to mention in time to meet up with my caravan of friends.  He's work was excellent, his team was polite and professional and I recommended him with out reservation.  I hope not to have this sort of issue again and need such a quick repair, but will think of him and his team first when I need anything done to my RV or other automibles!
