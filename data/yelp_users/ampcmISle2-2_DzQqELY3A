I had the pleasure of servicing a referral from Nate's office....An amazing experience for the out of town client....he coached and prepared them so that we were the successful bidder in a multiple offer situation...I highly recommend Nate and his Team.....

62 Floor Penthouse room was amazing...food awesome....getting my wife's pocketbook stolen with your license put a damper...when we found out that 3 cell phones were stolen from Eye Candy lounge had been reported in the last 7 days we wondered WHY?  It is so dark in there..that is why...  While leaving a guy screamed at me "Someone just stole 5k from me in"  Needless to say be careful...Professional thieves stalk these areas knowing conventions and easy going folks frequent these high end hotels...overall enjoyed the experience and staff.....

Over the years I loved flying SW..however, after a security flaw caused by them not checking the plane from the overnight return on the west coast to Boston....we  missed connecting flights and a day of learning from the CyberStar convention I was headed to that day....the frustration was the fact that they did not offer anything ... not that you are looking for it but it was not weather related, maintenance etc...it was there lack of systems that finally caught the mishap while we were on the runway....Yes..airlines are under much scrutiny and I am happy to be safe than sorry; however, the fair trade and expectation was broken...  I will give them another chance but this seems to be the rule not the exception.....my 3 cents with inflation...
