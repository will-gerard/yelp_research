This is my favorite restaurant in all of Vegas. The food is very good and the drink list/menu are untouchable for anywhere in town. This is a little off the beaten path, so if you are a tourist visiting, not only is it difficult to find, but a little tough to allow for the time away from the strip and everything else Vegas has to offer. Came here during NADA this year and was pleasantly surprised that my group of 8 was able to walk in, without reservations and enjoy a fantastic meal. We all ended up sharing things from steak to pasta to chicken. I also introduced a coworker to absinthe. They make it traditionally, so you get a show with the cocktail as well. Everything is so well done here, from the food to the drinks to the meticulously decorated interior. I absolutely love Herbs & Rye!

This place is absolutely amazing! Prices are super reasonable, if not super cheap. They have an amazing happy hour, which lasts forever. Not really, but, you get my drift. I had a salad and a couple of drinks and was treated like a normal human being, which was a first while I was in Arizona. They have fantastic specials on PBR as well, and from what it looked like, stumbling distance from the dorms. We came the morning before a Spring Training game and  it wasn't super slammed either. It was about a 6 minute drive to the Cubs ballpark as well, so, I couldn't find a single bad thing to say about the place. Definitely coming back next year for Spring Training.

I think I died and went to country heaven!!! Came here during spring training. We actually grabbed drinks DURING a Giants game, and the place was pleasantly comfortable, with great music playing. Drinks were relatively inexpensive, and apparently, when you have a ticket from a Giants game, you get your first beer free-ish. There was a DJ playing and by the looks of it, it gets a little rowdy. Only way I would want to add to this place would be some corn hole to generate some competition and conversation. They have digital beer taps at tables sitting around the center bar, which of course, has a dance floor ABOVE it. Super fun bar, I will be back for sure very soon. It may even be the location of my bachelor party. I will definitely be back when I am in Scottsdale again, and quite possibly another trip just to swing by again.

This place is AMAZING!!! I met Fergie Jenkins and I had the opportunity to get my name on the wrigley replica board. Beers are pretty pricey, so you may want to bring in a plastic flask. They also ran out of hot dogs, so that was a little bit of a bummer, but the Cubs won, so it was a great afternoon. I am looking forward to spending many more spring trainings here in the future.

Hi, my name is Adam and I used to be in the service industry as well.  Now that we are familiar with each other, this place is AWFUL. What do you get when your restaurant has received good press and you have an awful staff who thinks you're putting them out by dining at their establishment? Answer: Ocotillo. Upon entering the restaurant through the (very cute and comfortable) foyer, we were greeted by quite possibly the rudest hostess on the face of the planet. Mind you, we had reservations for Sunday brunch, had shown up right on time, if not, early and only required a table for four. Once the hostess got around to having us seated (yes, she couldn't be bothered to grab menus and take us there herself), we were left unattended for 17 minutes. 17!!!!!! We weren't very far from the airport and realized going anywhere else would've just wasted an entire day, so, 17 minutes is better than 45. Once we ordered our drinks, we waited yet another 10 or so to get them delivered. These weren't four Ramos Fizzes, or anything, just two glasses of wine and two beers. Once we received our drinks, we ordered. The food took a while, but we did have a medium burger, so, I won't complain about that. Our food came and OH. MY. GOD. The chimichanga ALMOST made up for the horrific service. Listen, if you can tough through the torture that is the awful service and pretentiousness that are the employees, you should come here for brunch. The food is delightful, but the service absolutely destroyed my rating of this place.
