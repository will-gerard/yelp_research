Weve been owners with Diamond Resorts for over 11 years.  It's definitley a love / hate relationship for us.  Disappointed with our lastest week stay at the Links...see pics for some ideas.  Bed was hard, place was run down, our housekeeping services sucked, ceiling fan was broken,  faucet was loose, carpet was stained, furniture out dated...just an all around disappointment.  Did like that we had a 3 bedroom room...and love having a kitchen and flat screen tv's in all the rooms.  They also blocked off the parking spaces closest to our unit to stage new mattresses.  When we left no one asked how our stay was, but my wife volunteered an answer...they just dont care once you have fallen for the con of ownership.

They just made my 5 star list.  Today Home Depot hosted a birthday party for my 7 year old.  They let us use the conference room, and provided some building sets, tools and paint for the kids to build projects.  The kids had a blast, and it was perhaps one of the best kids parties I have been to in a while.  Thank you Home Depot for making my kids day special.

Haven't been here in a while, but have to say returning was like finding an old friend.  Great deal with a coupon, but kind of pricey otherwise(that is for people like me on a budget).  Had the Pullano's Special (about $25) and some wings (40 for around $23).  Also had the large cheese pizzas ($12.99 w/ coupon)  Great food, energetic atmosphere, definitely a great place to grab a slice and watch a game.  We were in a party of 7 and I almost double tipped.  Didn't see that added 18% gratuity until after signing the receipt, so if you've had a few BEWARE.

Went to buy some tortillas yesterday, nothing like warm, fresh tortillas.  Had a red chili burrito to go and it was sooo good.  You might not expect to find something like this in a bakery, but it is a little hidden jewel.  So if you are in the mood for somehting yummy, or you want some baked goods stop by, and give the burritios a try.  I have also had the green chili (long time ago) and it was nice and spicy, but they were out this time.

Woke up Thursday morning to a flat tire.  Hit up this location and 20 minutes later I was on the road again.  Gotta love it.

I was a little nervous after reading the other Yelper's comments, but we purchased a tent trailer on consignment and I have no complaints.  They set it up as soon as I expressed interested and verified everything worked.  We worked with Ed and he was very helpful and did a great job.  Only one area of improvement would be to speed up the paperwork process, but even that wasn't a big deal.

Shoe string French fries, need I say more?  Thin, crunchy little delights.  oh, and the burger isn't bad either.  Stop by on a Friday evening, and there are usually some old cars to check out in the parking lot.

Place lacks quality control.  Ordered the machaca combo, and it was completely void of flavor.  Please add salt...even the salsa was bland.  Come on, get it together.

First time coming today after reading their reviews.  I had the Philly Cheese Steak Burger, and it did not disappoint.  Decent sized patty covered with thin slices of steak, peppers, onions, and a gooey slice of cheese melted on top and all inside a toasty bun...DELISH!!  Also ordered a side of fried zucchini, which I thought was really good, but a little on the greasy side.  If you like a good greasy burger, then this may be your place.  The decor isn't very fancy, but they have a huge soda selection, and several different burger choices.

Yummy is all I can really say about the wedge burger and sweet potato smash fries.  Crisp fresh wedge of lettuce with tomato, red onion, blue cheese and bacon...it was really great.  Don't forget to ask for some chipotle mayo dipping sauce to go with the fries.  Kind of pricey, but one of my favorites.

Not sure whats happened to the place, but its really gone downhill.  Staff is ill prepqred and on the brude side, asked to speak with a manager and was told he was busy in his office...really?  Its been over 20 minutes and still no sign of him.  Tables arent bussed, had to ask to get a clean table so we could eat.  Not able to rate the food, i was too frustrated to enjoy it.  Asked for water cups, only one was clean so they gave us a childs paper cup.  Brought out part of our order, didnt know where the rest of it was and it took 3 tries to get a side of chipotle mayo right.  Sorry, will be contacting corporate on this one.  Now 30 minutes and still no manager...checked the front and here is no line either.  Ordered a shake, got it in a paper cup, not the steel cup that gives a little extra...as the customer next to us received his...in a timely manner.  Did I mention my wife had go get her shake...took over 20 minutes for that taken care of.  Up to 35 minutes and still no manager....wow!  UPDATE: We did finally get to speak to a manager, I believe his name was Chris.  Came to find out one of the cooks quit that day, and he had been in the kitchen preparing our meal.  Have to give him a little slack and will update by 1 star.  He was great, firendly, professional, an asset to the company.  Also heard back from Corporate, and they really seem to care about their service.  Will give it another try based on these experiences.

Holy salt lick Batman...had lunch here today with my mother and kids.  For a restaurant that I generally enjoy, this was by far the worst meal I have EVER had.  Ordered the Red Devil Pork Sandwich, hoping for a little spice with my BBQ.  Instead I got a mouth full of over salted meat that made my mom gag when she tried it.  I have never sent a meal back, but this was absolutely inedible. The restaurant was kind enough to comp us the $.40 (yes forty cents) difference to replace the sandwich I could not eat.  It was so bad I couldn't even eat anything else and had to get my food to go.  Not my usual experience with this place, however its was the first time eating at this location.  I guess the bill for the aquarium really makes it hard for them to swallow the cost of an overpriced sandwich.  Update:  Had the take home replacement order today.  The pulled pork sandwich was good, however I would have preferred to have my potato salad without the black hair.  Really????? You would think they would be a little careful.

Visited for the first time on Sunday.  They have a 3 sub Sunday special which was more than enough for my family of four.  Bread was ok, not perfect, but everything else was good. They have daily specials, and a 5.50 foot long selection.  We'll be back for sure.  Staff was very friendly,  can't beat good customer service.

Stopped in today after church, clean, upbeat environment.   First time here, so we asked about their most popular sandwiches.  Definitely gave a great recommendation - I went with the #9 Italian Night Club w/ hot peppers.  Good amount of meat, and other condiments.  Peppers gave it a nice little kick, even picked up a bag of their Jalapeno Potato Chips.  My only complaint is I wish the sandwich was a little bigger, it was gone, but I wanted to keep eating because it was so good.     Fed a family of 4 for about $20, which isn't too bad.   Music was playing, but I didn't think it was too loud.  Sandwiches were finished about the same time we paid, so not a lot of waiting required.  Sorry Mr. Goodcents, but I may have just found a new sub shop.

I'm not a sushi pro, but an occasional indulger.  Stopped here last night on a whim, and it did not disappoint.   We arrived around 5:30, and were all alone.  Small establishment, seats about 30.  Ordered a spicy tuna roll, lava roll, shrimp roll and the fried California roll...they threw in a tootsie roll which was surprising.   I know rolls arent't  real "sushi", but it was still yummy.  They started the meal with a crab and cucumber salad which was delicious.  We will definitely be back, and the prices were awesome.  All this for only $20.

Not sure if it was luck or the norm, but if you're hungry and want it fast, then this is the place to eat.  Hot, fresh and tasty sums it up pretty well.  Even my kid ate all his food, and that rarely happens.  The place is clean and modern looking, with a throw back to the past with their candy section.  The only thing that wasn't to my preference was the salsa, the heat was there but a little too tangy for me.   Had the red chili open face Navajo taco, and it was the bomb diggity!  Finished off the meal with their sopapilla, covered it with powdered sugar and honey, and it hit the spot.  We will be back for sure, might be the place to go on a Sunday after church.  It wasn't too busy on a Friday evening, which was good for us, but not for them.  They do have other things on the menu, so if you're not a fan of fry bread fan, try something else.  Give it a try, I think you'll enjoy!

Looking for good street tacos, then this is your place.  I don't know what it is, but the carne asada taco's are GRRRREAT.  Meat is cooked just right, onion, guacamole and cilantro.  Reminds me of those late nights heading home from Tijuana.  The salsa has a good amount of heat, which just ties the whole thing together.  I was introduced by a friend from Mexico who was struggling to find something good close to GCC.  Nothing fancy about the atmosphere, just a few tables and chairs.  If you attend the college and bring your ID, they will give you 10% off. Definitely worth stopping by.

We have been here on three occasions so far, and I really like the food. The quesa poblano (Quesadilla with poblano chili's and oaxaca cheeese) is awesome.  I have only had the carne asada and al pastor street tacos, with beans and rice, and have no complaints.  Perhaps my favorite thing is the salsa bar, I am really partial to the Seven Chili's and the Salsa Mexicana, but there are so many great choices.  My only complaint is that on 2 of the three occasions we have been there, they have been understaffed on the front end.  Food comes out quickly, but not always the best service.  We never had our water refilled, and it took three requests to get a beer brought to the table.  Can't blame the server, they have been busy, but management may want to reconsider how they staff.   Overall, this is becoming on of my favorite go-to spots for tacos.  If the service improves, I would bump it up to 5 stars.

They now have recliners in some of the theaters.  I hope they don't change the prices, because this is now my favorite place to stop and catch a flick.

I have to say that one advantage to doing business with a small business is they know how to do customer service right.  After a small hiccup beyond his control, AJ made things right.  I really appreciate all your help in getting my trailer back up and running.  If you need it fixed, give AJ a call.

Mmmm good I guarantee!   Had the shrimp bag with corn, sausage and potatoes.   Trifacta medium heat it was delicious.   Would skip the corn next time.  Even ate just the garlic in the bag...felt guilty about it.  For a Louisiana restaurant,  they need sweet tea, not the same with just sugar.  Will be back for sure.
