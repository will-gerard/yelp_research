They do a great job! My only mechanic in the valley! I've had my rear brakes done, I've at my cv joint and front axel replaced.  Every job is A+

This place is a gem. Too restaurant in DC Ranch. 100 wines by the glass? Two stars just for that. Free bread. One more star. Sitting and watching the service well bartenders supply this restaurant with wine, martinis and lemon drops is amazing. These guys are class acts and work extremely hard.  Lighting is very dim. Place could use a lil face lift.  Yet this is an all CLASSIC American steakhouse.   Came in to get seated. The place was booked solid. The staff was very courteous and found my party seats as soon as something cleared.  I would done here every night if my wallet would allow.   The bone in ribeye iron crusted with truffle poached lobster and caviar might just be my last meal if asked.  Two very big thumbs up! Service and ambiance were great although it was crazy busy.

If you are looking for Gyros, this is the place. Compares to any top Gyro in the planet. The restaurant is clean and small. It takes a lil time to get your Gyro, so its best to call and order it 10 minutes ahead of time. One of my top places for a quick lunch with friends on the go!

Come here on the regular. Almost like a home away from home. Brent, Auburn, Mart√≠n, Brendan, kaitlyn and Jennifer are amongst the best when it comes to service and hospitality. They want you to walk away happy! Don't come here with your snobsdale attitude or any where for that matter.  Oh and what places in grayhawk stay open until 2 every night? Juans Does  I'll be back tonight.  Happy Cinco de Mayo In regards Jose

Everything was great. Just a small sorbet and ice cream shop with amazing variety.   The pear and cucumber sorbet is delightful.  Price is a steal.  And they are open until midnight.

TV management is ran by cavemen. I dont want to rip this place apart. But after today I will never be back. Or recommend. Changed a game with two minutes left and refused to put it back on. Just 1 of 5 reasons. Mind blown
