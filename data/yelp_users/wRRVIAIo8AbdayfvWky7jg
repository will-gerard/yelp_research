My words in this review will most likely not convey my disappointment with this establishment.  However, I will try my best.  I dropped off a prescription Tuesday evening.  I pulled up to the drive-thru and waited at the window for over 5 minutes without being acknowledged.  Not a "hi, we'll be right with you" Nothing.  I wasn't in a hurry and understand that these places can get crazy busy so I waited this time without pressing the "Call for service" button and when I finally did, waited another several minutes before I was rudely greeted by a younger girl who looked like she would rather be doing anything at that moment besides helping me.  I then gave her the prescription and it took her another several minutes to tell me that they would have to order it and it wouldn't be available for me to pick up until that Friday!  I was a little upset that I needed my medication and would not be able to obtain it until then, but I figured what can I do, and agreed to be there Friday to pick it up.  Upon arriving Friday after work, I was in a hurry to get home and figured they had plenty of time to get it good and ready for me by Friday afternoon and assumed it wouldn't take more than a couple minutes.  First off, they only had one of what I had been expecting three of, THEN they wanted to charge me over 80 dollars for something that has always cost me 10.  I said that there must be some mistake and the "kid" behind the counter said he didn't know what to tell me except this is what they are supposed to charge according to my insurance company.  So I left, extremely upset, without my medication.  Then I called my Insurance company and I was told that CVS was wrong and I was only supposed to pay the 10 dollars as usual.  When I went back, I was prepared to sit and wait as long as it took in order to get my medication at the price I was supposed to be charged.  I ended up spending over an hour in the CVS this time until they finally figured out they were wrong.  I ended up leaving that day with my medication which I paid the amount expected from the beginning and left with a smile on my face and at no time was rude to the "less than educated" workers behind the counter because while I waited for them to fix their mix up, there were several customers who were presented with similar situations, all of which were not nice to the staff.  This however is no excuse for them to be little punks and not give a crap about people, this is our health we're talking about and it should not be dealt with by a bunch of dumb dumbs...  I will most likely be going elsewhere next time I need a prescription filled.

I have never really put too much thought into places like this, there really isn't THAT much that goes into a stop at Jamba juice... However, on one particular morning, I visited Jamba to get oatmeal and a carrot juice and couldn't have been more impressed with how fantastic the staff was!  I had a nice, comfortable conversation with the girl who worked the register, I believe her name was Maggie, it probably helped that they weren't busy but it was a very nice experience that pretty much paved the way for an awesome day.  And I really can't complain about the smoothies there, I think they're good, but the oatmeal was incredible!  Yummy yummy yummy!!!

I've been going to this place for years, sometimes for special occasions, and sometimes it can be a weekly get together with family.  No matter when it is, the sushi is hands down the best I've ever had.  I am a sushi connoisseur and in all of the places I've been and had sushi, NY, CA, IL, WA, FL, Mexico... nothing compares to the quality!  The price is very reasonable as well.  The only thing that is a tad disappointing is that the wait staff there seems to have a high turnover rate, I sometimes see a couple of the sushi chefs who I can remember from as far back as six years, but other than that, as much as my family and friends and I go there, we never get recognized as "regulars" because there's always someone new working there!  I'd say that's their only downfall.... Other than that, this would be by far my favorite place to eat in Arizona ;)

If I could give a half star, I would have.  Though I should have known when I drove up to the place and there were only 3 other cars in the parking lot that it was going to be a bust.  After a traitorous hiking experience, my bf and I were in desperate need of some deslish Mexican food, but unfortunately we were disappointed with yucky Mexican food. I got the chicken soft tacos which were WAY overpriced for two little flour tortillas that contained about 6 cubes of chicken each and that's it, no cheese, no nothin'. His chicken mole enchiladas were even worse! The (dark meat) chicken was so dry and tough he couldn't even finish it and that's not usual coming from someone who always cleans their plate n then finishes mine.  We ended up spending 50 bucks on a lunch that was really (for lack of a better term) gross.   Sorry, but you're not our Amigo and we won't be returning.

Went to dinner here last night.  I loved the Quartino option for the wine for only a few dollars more!  The Lobster ravioli wasn't the best, but the dish my bf got was awesome, I just don't remember what it was called, but it was also a ravioli of some sort.  The bread was yummy, hot and soft, just how I like it!  And the waiter was prompt and polite.  I can't say one bad thing about this place except for the rude customers at the bar who were raising hell over not being able to split the cost of a SOUP between two checks.  The fact that they were being so loud, we knew every detail about their situation was a little annoying considering we had to put our own conversation on hold because of the disturbance.   But that's neither here nor there... and has no reflection on my opinion of the restaraunt.  And I'm definitely a Fan. ;)

It's ALWAYS a good night at Carrabba's!  The staff is awesome, and I found my new favorite dish, the Pollo Rosa Maria.  All I can say is DELISH!  The wine is a little pricey, but it's worth it to sip with dinner, I just love this place...

This place is amazing and I'm going back this coming weekend. They are known for their delicious wings and I have to admit, they are the best wings I've ever had!  The staff was extremely nice and the service was fast which was surprising considering how packed they were.  I only wish there was a location closer to my house!  People of Teakwoods, if you're reading this, please bring a location to East Mesa!!  ;)

I've always been a fan of the Dilly Bird, it's just a delicious sandwich... I can't speak for all locations but the one in Mesa off of Southern was a real disappointment the other night.  I waited almost 30 minutes for a cold turkey sandwich!  After working all day and sitting in traffic for an hour the last thing I want to do is sit in a fast food joint for that long, especially when all the "kids" behind the counter are messing around talking about their homework and girlfriends or boyfriends and not working.  I have been going to this location for a dilly bird for longer than I can remember, but unfortunately I will not be returning any time soon unless someone can guarantee I wont have to sit and listen to teenagers for a half hour while I wait for a cold sandwich.

Wings are good, Pizza's good, beer is cheap...and good, and the waitors/waitresses are fun and helpful and very nice.  PLUS football season is my fav. and it's the best place to be for it.  LOVE this place.

This sneaky little establishment might be good for some, but I have nothing good to say about it.  I had the Free Range Chicken and I suppose by keeping the bones in it they are able to give the "organic" feel, but I feel, if I'm spending that much for chicken, that the bones should be removed before I eat it to prevent having to remove them from my mouth after I've taken a bite.  And my boyfriend had the Italian Buffalo Mozzarella which consisted of three small meatballs for almost 20 dollars.  The place was a rip off as far as I'm concerned.  Oh and I can't forget to mention the lovely lady walking around with her camera offering to take pictures of our party, which I thought was nice, until she charged us $75 dollars a picture!  Vegas can be on the expensive side, but this was just outrageous.

Now THIS is my kinda place!!!  We loved it so much we were back twice within the 3 days we spent in Vegas.  The food is delicious and the entertainment at night is awesome as well.  I had the wings the first night we were there and my boyfriend had a cheeseburger, two foods that sounds extremely ordinary but were so much more than that!  We had a great time there and I just know we'll be going back every time we visit!

Being as my friends and I frequent this spot on a weekly basis, I'd say it's one of my favorite places to be in Arizona.  With the outdoor sand volleyball courts, ping pong tables, horseshoes, bags, live music, and grill where you can cook your own food, it's a great place for friends to gather and have a great time.  Plus the beer is cheep and they have a good selection.  ;)

From their unique organic teas and fruit juice selections, to their fresh fully stocked salad bar, this place has me SOLD! I'm not usually in the Scottsdale area, so it was a nice surprise to stumble upon this wonderful market and grab a healthy.  I was surprised at how inexpensive it was, and still so fresh! I will definitely be back many a nights before class to indulge on the (did I mention fresh?) Salad bar ;-)

This place really surprised me, from the outside it looks very boutique-y and overpriced... but when I went inside I found that every thing was very reasonably priced and I didn't see one thing I didn't like!  I ended up getting one of the cutest unique dresses I've ever seen and I'm really excited about it!  The employees were helpful and nice (always a plus) and I will definitely be back... I can't wait in fact!

Happy hour at this Applebee's is like snow bird central.  There's always a line out the door, a long wait, and the dozens of grandparents who occupy it seem to be there e.v.e.r.y.d.a.y... However! We LOVE it! The specials are great (best on our side of town actually) and we get a seat at the bar almost every time regardless how crowded it is.  The 2 regular bartenders Chance and (blonde dude, can't remember his name but he's cool too) are always very nice,fast, and make awesome drinks. We come here almost every week, and it never disappoints! 5 stars! :)

I could get into trouble here...  I absolutely LOVE Italian soda's and this place's got em!  I don't know of any other place near my work that has these delightful drinks, but now that I've found em, I'm drawn to it!  I really enjoy coming here to, the people working there are always really nice and welcoming.  They have lots of other neat healthy foods also but I haven't had the pleasure of trying them yet.  As long as I'm working right up the street, this will be a place I frequent as much as possible!

update; their food effing sucks... so far i've tried the chicken salad with pita bread and the grilled chicken salad, both were pre-made sitting in a cooler... the chicken salad had about as much flavor as my vitamins i take everyday and the grilled chicken on my salad was tough and unpleasant... i will not get another 9 dollar peice of crap meal here ever again.

Meatballz has become a daily stop for me lately.  It's the only place around I can get a reasonably priced lunch salad that's fresh and delicious!  The Italian dishes look and smell amazing but I've been sticking to salads lately so that's all I've had, but I'm sure I will try other things eventually.  Their tuna salad is probably one of the best I've ever had.

No specials, poor service, is how I would sum this place up 90 percent of the time. My bf and I are here now and being treated pretty well because we are wearing Cowboys gear and Cowboys fans get a complimentary schnapps shot and 2 hot wings. However, it took more than 10 minutes to get a waitress to acknowledge us when we sat down at the dirty table we had to ask to have cleaned...this place has the potential to be great, nice TVs, good wings, nice waitresses (while the waitresses are really hot, they don't seem to be too concerned with the quality of their service), but it NEEDS good drink and food specials BAD.  It's our corner bar, we want it to be good!
