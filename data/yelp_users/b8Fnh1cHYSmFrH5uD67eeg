I am going to give 4 stars for our first time there. The servers were really nice and the food was surprisingly good for a bar. They have the standard burgers and appetizers, but they also had wraps, soups, salads, pasta and deserts. I was shocked with the choices they had.   We went as a large group so food was a little slow coming out, but worth the wait. I will absolutely go back there.

What a great group of people. They are friendly and they explain all the options so you can make an informed decision. I have used their services twice in the past two years for window chips and recommend them.

Saturday is always a busy night to go out, so we knew there would be a wait, and 20 minutes isn't bad. So after about 20 minutes I witnessed a couple get seated that came in after us....huh?! Then another, and another....what?! So my husband went up to talk to them (I think to shut me up) and oh the little hand held buzzer thing they gave us wasn't working. I was so angry (and hungry) I could have screamed. Although the evening started out crummy, the manager was really great and brought us out an appetizer platter on the house.  The food was good and the bread sticks hit the spot.

Wow this is a really nice place. I've never visited this cinema before, but I was surprised. The restrooms are clean and modern, the theatre is a great size and they have a great selection at the snack bar. I will go back to this theatre for sure.

They were great. We had a large group in for lunch. The servers were super nice. The food was standard Chills fare. For the price I think we all got more food than we could eat.

This location didn't have exactly what I was looking for, but the staff was very nice and helped me with alternatives. I ended up not getting what I was looking for, but still left with some supplies for my office.

The people are nice, but they always seem to be in a rush and there is not usually a line. It's a little expensive, but they do an okay job. It's pretty close to the house so there is a convenience factor built in there.

I was super excited to have my windows tinted finally. It's way too hot in Arizona without tint on your car. The guys at A Better Tint were great. They were clean, quick and reasonably priced....best of all Lifetime Guarantee! They went over the options and showed me what would look best. I'm very happy I chose to use this company for my vehicle tint. I would absolutely use their services again!

YUM! We ate at Barro's tonight. The pizza was good, staff was great and the restaurant was empty.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because it was so dang cold in there.

They had a good selection and prices were okay. Not much to say...they are out of business now.

This is a cute little country bar & grill. I pass this place all the time and didn't know it was there. The food was good, the drinks were cold and the music was very country.   They have a nice size dance floor, but not knowing any of the country dances I didn't attempt too much. The band they had the night I was there was okay, but the place was packed. We had a great time and I'm sure we will go back.

I've been a Pure Fitness member for a few years....so what can I say. The price is great, people are friendly, the facility is very clean and they have a decent class schedule (Love Zumba, yoga and kickboxing!). My only complaint about them is the pushy personal trainers trying to get you to buy training sessions, supplements and meal replacement bars/drinks. Once you get past that, you are golden!

I am not usually a fan of places like this, but I went with my husband. I was pleasantly surprised how good it was. I had a burger and chocolate shake. The food was good and the service was wonderful. I would absolutely go again.

I have used Sharko's catering services at several company functions such as BBQ, awards dinners, holiday parties, etc. They are a full service catering company, specializing in AWESOME! The people are super nice, the food is amazing, and the service is top notch. They have party rentals too, so it's a one stop shop. I can't say enough good things about this company. They have been an amazing addition to my event planning arsenal.

Love this little place. The coffee is always fresh and they have some yummy salads, sandwiches and sweet treats. I'm here about once or twice a month and always something good to enjoy.

We ate here because of convenience and location. We were at the lake, hungry, and not ready to go home yet. They have an okay menu selection, but I would never go out of my way to go back.

My husband and I enjoyed our 3rd anniversary here. Growing up in a big (loud) Italian family Bucca made me feel right at home. I love waling through the kitchen to get to your table, the family style dining, the music, and the artwork. Thank you for making our evening so special!

YUM! This place is awesome! I stopped by here Friday night with my girlfriends and LOVED IT! The place was clean, the people behind the counter were very helpful, and they had lots of flavors to choose from (I went with mango for my choice). They also have sugar-free options, so I was impressed. I will absolutely be back.

I have been a client of Jayson's for five years. He really took the time to explain what my coverage meant and saved me money on my car and renters insurance. At my age, I didn't think I needed life insurance, but after discussing it with Jayson I decided now was a great time to get it while I am young and insurable.   I never knew how bad my old car insurance was until we reviewed it. Now Jayson does a review for me every year to see if there are new discounts that can save me more money. For example when I moved from Mesa to Gilbert I saved more money.

What exactly they put in their food that makes me love this place so much, I will never understand. It's simple, it's quick, it's yummy, and it's the same at every one of their locations. The people are nice, the place is clean and they have lots of locations. The portions are not giant, but more than you need at one meal. Prices are reasonable and everything is fresh.

I really like this outdoor mall! Tempe Marketplace has some nice stores, good restaurants and a Harkins. My only issue with this mall is parking..it's always packed, but I don't see that many people walking around.

I went to Tempe Paintball a while back with a group and was extremely unimpressed with the lack of safety rules. We've done paintball before at other places and "fingers on the triggers" in other places is a giant no-no when you are outside of the game area. This place has no rules on it or does not enforce it. Kids need to be taught right away to always be safe. The staff didn't seem to care about it, which made my group feel very unsafe. I did like the facility but when this happened we decided to never go back. We love paintball, but we will find another place to go from now on.

Well I've been to D'Arcy McGee's now for a third time (trying to give it the benefit of the doubt). The staff is always nice, the bathrooms are clean, and the place looks nice. With all that being said, I've found that each time we are there the food is only okay and the beer isn't cold enough. Yesterday was exactly the same as the times before. It's an easy place to visit after a movie or shopping, but I don't think I'll be back if I don't have to.

I really enjoyed the food. They provide a nice selection and the price is great. The atmosphere was a little lacking, but the staff was very nice. My husband didn't care for it, but he's not a big fan of Indian food. I will absolutely be back for the garlic naan...yum!

La Fitness just took over Pure Fitness...yea more locations for me to choose from! Well maybe not this one. I went into this location because it is on my way home from work, just to check it out. The people behind the desk were kind of rude. I asked for a tour and they told me to just take a look around. They didn't really want to be bothered with me. Is this all the LA Fitness locations or just this one? I'll check out the location in south Scottsdale and see if they are a little nicer.

Okay I was so excited to have ladies night here and have never been more disappointed. We purchased packages of pedicure, paraffin dip and glass of wine...perfect right? No! Sure the place is beautiful but the pedicure was not. The foot and leg massage was weak, the paint job they did was sloppy and oh they forgot to mention they don't have a liquor license so the police shut them down from serving. Um, ok? Thanks for nothing. We will never be back.

Not a fan. The service was crap and the food was only okay. There was a big group of us, so that may have thrown them off, but it's not like the place was packed. I don't think I'll ever be back.

Laguna Rocks! I had laser hair removal done with Ilen. She is wonderful, kind, and patient. I always feel comfortable. The center is clean and equipment is top notch. I think their prices are very reasonable. I couldn't be happier, my legs are always smooth and beautiful.

I have been a client of Faith's for five years now. She is a very talented stylists and super sweet. As an educator for Eufora, Faith knows the importance of using quality hair products in and out of the salon. She can help you achieve your healthiest hair and scalp, to look your knock-your-socks-off best! I recommend Faith to anyone looking for an exceptional stylist. As a licensed hair professional, that says a lot.

So, I love this Place. We had a little mix up tonight and I somehow got someone else's bowl. The manager was so wonderful about it. He let me make another bowl and didn't charge me for dinner. I will be back again and again..
