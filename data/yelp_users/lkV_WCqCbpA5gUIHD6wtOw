So my husband has accused me of the store having my photograph up...warning the staff that a whirlwind is coming to buy up all the merchandise. He probably isn't wrong. When my Mom and I come in it is like "Watch out girls' here we come!"  I love this place...This is perfect for a woman, not a size negative zero sorry girls' if you don't eat this isn't the place for you go down the street and BEBE will help you out. This place is reserved for women with a figure.   The clothes come in great colors, designs and they work for all sizes. They go from a size 0-3 which is basically a size 4-16. They have everything from Casual to Moderately Dressy but generally work for the Casual and also for casual work. You won't find your Ann Taylor suits here. They have great prices on their sale racks (which I love) however they can run up in price for a shirt $68 and up.  Join their frequent buyer program, you will get their catalogue which will get you a coupon every month and a 5% discount on everything you buy.   I wear 90% chico's and always get complimented, their stuff doesn't go out of fashion and they have great accessories to match!

I absolutely refuse to spend a fortune to clean my clothes I mean cmon...I already spend a fortune buying them RIGHT?  This is a place to bring your everyday stuff though. I wouldn't bring my husband's $300 slacks I just wouldn't risk it...I'm sure they would be OK but...  We take all his Tommy Bahama wear there and my stuff that can't be washed at home, they do a great job and it is a $1.99 or if you have a coupon which I usually do it is only $1.75 as Gabi K said you do have to pay up front which is OK and to avoid the debit fee remember to bring a check (remember those things...) they take them here hassle free they don't even require your blood type.  I personally do NOT care for the way men's shirts are done here (laundry) with or without starch they never come out right...I have yet to find a great place I'm still on the hunt until then it's Hubby and I taking turns with the iron because if I can't find someone to do it right we will do it ourselves...

My daughter has been attending here since she was 4 years old.  She loves her teachers and all the diversity in the programs she is offered. She is now in the 4th Grade and I can't imagine her leaving to go anywhere else.  We have had our ups and downs as any family would but we have always been met by the Administration openly and honestly. I've heard from those that have never been to Rancho how hard it is, and how strict it is...For those don't knock it till you try it. My daughter definitely has to work hard, but that is why I send her...She is going there for a First Class Education and I believe that is what we are giving her...She has her sights set on Pepperdine University and I see nothing getting in her way!!!

Anyhow I have to write this review (Cindy you run an awesome business love it love it love it)  So Kylie has had her birthday here twice.  Once on the go, and once at Glam Central. She has had a great time and the kids have enjoyed it too the max.  This review however is for our visit on 10/15 so my daughter talks my Mother into visiting this lovely boutique all decked out for girls. She explains to her that she NEEDS a robe! We had just been to Justice where they have some super cute robes in the $30-$40 range fleece very sweet and she doesn't mention it. She goes onto say that she freezes in the house every night that she might get sick and that it is just terrible for her. My Mother looks at me like I'm Worst Mother of the Year (Don't you love that...) Anyway they go off looking for robes. I personally know the price of the robes I've been here five millions times and Kylie goes to School with the owner's daughter. SO Kylie comes frolicking out with the robe she MUST have. My Mother is beaming as well they have made their decision. I go back to my blackberry where i'm texting my husband about this whole thing as my Mom hasn't seen the price (She doesn't look at these things). Kylie then sees a stuffed dog and starts about that and luckily Mom puts her foot down. So they go to the register and ring the robe up and GASP $85 with tax...My Mom looks at me as if to say REALLY??? I smile and say WHAT you wanted to take her here. I was happy to get her one at Justice LOL   So what do you think does she have her Girly Girlz robe...Of Course! Is it beautiful...Of Course it is to die for...Swankky Blanket pink chenille with satin lining I can't deny way better than anything...Girly Girlz does have beautiful stuff for our little girls...and I wonder why she has such taste :)

My daughter has attended PCDS for the past four years and she will continue on until she graduates.  We have been very happy with the Middle School and so far the High School.  One of the best features aside from the gorgeous campus is that they offer Mandarin. I am hoping this doesn't change and that the language is continually supported as it sets the school apart from others. The classes are small and there is plenty of personal attention my daughters graduating class is 75 which is one of the bigger classes. Our sports facility will be incredible and Science is HUGE. Freshman English is a little scary but she is getting by and in the long run will help her with her testing.  All in all an amazing school we love it.

OK so don't shoot the messenger...This is the place I absolutely LOVE. My friend CASI works here and she cuts my hair and it is to die for. You get treated like a Queen...and why shouldn't I? Really, I mean kids, family and all the rest of the things life throws at you to melt away for an hour to get my hair done AAAHHH...  Casi cuts my hair and she is fantastic...Other treatments are awesome too, the LeStone is to die for and in my opinion really any of the massages I don't love the hydro massage I don't need that much water personally. I have had a facial, but I'm not a fan...Not because of the Princess just not a fan of facials. The facility is great and you get to use it all day if you book a treatment. If you are a Fairmont President Member you get 10% off Spa Treatments.   Last Year while I was getting my hair done I saw Miley Cyrus waiting for a treatment...My daughter was so excited when I came home with her autograph although when she thought about it she was miffed I didn't take her with me and she could have met her. She did see her the night before in concert and touch her hand what more could a child want sheesh...

Well yelper's you are right it is a fabulous place to get pizza...I am of course biased. My brother is the one in the photo.  His name is Tony and he is the "Tony" in Tony's Mamma Mia's the second location.  My kids beg constantly to go and have pizza at Uncle Tony's place...It's such a drive though. When we do make that drive it never disappoints, there isn't a pizza like it anywhere...well that isn't true I would have to use an awful lot of frequent flier points to fly us all back East so Mamma Mia's takes care of us here on the West Coast where pizza just isn't usually done right.   Their pasta's and subs are great too and the kids love to get some ice cream for dessert.  This is A+ all the way...Thanks guys for keeping Tony alive in our hearts and our tummy's :)

Not my first time...Definitely not my last :) This is one of my faves...and any excuse to stuff myself with Italian food well what can I say. We went last night for dinner with the kiddos and my parents. The food was great, I had my favorite Rigatoni D I just can't order anything else...I know there is tons of other great stuff I just love this. I ordered the extra pig size hehe so I could have dinner tonight!  The service was OK but it is never exceptional! The waiter was knowledgeable but was pushing the dinner special with SO much food it would feed a small country. Other than that though it was awesome... My biggest criticism though every time I go there we get stuck in a seating area where we are attached to a pole...I mean why is that? I end up talking to the big brown square tower it is so annoying! Oh well sometimes that makes for better conversation than my husband :)

Decided to celebrate my husbands birthday with family and friends. We love good food and great drinks. We were hoping for both.  We were a party of 12 and the atmosphere was fun and loud and that was perfect for our celebration.  My drink arrived in a chipped glass (the drink was awesome) so the waiter brought me a new drink and a new glass however the drink he brought back was awful. So that was bummer. We all ordered something different and got tons of sides for the table.  I thought I was safe getting the steak and it was over cooked which was a bummer. Everyone that got fish was disappointed in its flavor and appearance. Desserts were nice the starters were good and the creamed corn didn't disappoint. It's our last visit I'm afraid. We've been there a dozen times and the last two times just weren't good. So sad to see a once great place not so great.

The pharmacy has always been great to us! I have a son who has to take an array of medications and if ever there is an issue they always make sure he doesn't run out. They go the extra mile to make phone calls and fax. It sometimes takes an extra day but who is to say that is the Dr or the Pharmacy. If he has run out they will give him an emergency supply which has been a lifesaver at times. This is one pharmacy I can't live without. Now a question...What is it with Walgreen's I can't leave the store without buying $50 worth of junk...I swear the kids come in and I leave with a bunch of stuff I don't need. WEIRD???

Busy right after school which is to be expected...Wasn't very clean which is disappointing, especially for an ice cream parlor. We stopped in to try the new soft serve ice cream with sprinkles that turn the ice cream a new color. Don't know if the boy behind the counter was stingy or what, but the kids got only a couple of sprinkles that didn't even cover the ice cream which was disappointing considering they charge for them. All in all wouldn't visit this location again. We prefer the one closer to home :)

This is great Mexican food...With a lot of places to choose from I am definitely a fan...The owners can be a bit standoffish and times but hey whatever...  What we really care about is the food. SO what can I honestly say is great...Well the Sweet Corn Tamale is by far the most amazing thing I've ever tasted (OK not really but the best thing I've tasted at jalapeno's). They have great Fajita's, and some great combo meals.   Margarita's are yummy and they have a great specials such as Taco Tuesday's (All you can eat Taco's). Margarita Monday's jump on their website to see them. Definitely worth the drive up to North Scottsdale.  As for the chips and salsa hold the phone...They have corn and flour chips mixed with the yummiest salsa! Now they just need a guacamole made table side (or one that tastes good)   Overall the food is great, the service is mediocre never outstanding but the food makes up for it...  Enjoy...

Not my first time here, but my first time for Breakfast.  It was great. I had the Bacon and Egg with cheese Sandwich I asked for NO lettuce and Tomato as that seemed awfully lunchy to me, and it was YUM...I called first to see if I could bring my dog with me if we ate outside and I was surprised to hear that we could...  So YAY I found another place to bring Higgins to. They brought him some water and found us a shady spot on the patio. He loves to go out to eat (He is a terrier so he isn't a large dog) and he behaved nicely thank you for asking :)...We went with my daughter who was on Fall Break and she had the Hot Chocolate and doughnuts they looked sinful.  The waitress was quite daffy and messed up our order a few times and kept forgetting things, but with the weather being so perfect and the company being excellent it was hard to notice. My Mom went inside and had a muffin and before I left I had to buy some of their sweet potato chips to bring home...those things are like another part of heaven. I hide them in my home office I know it's wrong, but what can I say I love them :)

OK so I just found out that you should join a Fitness Club to work out...Wow who knew??? Weird...  We have been members for a while now and although I've worked out here only a handful of times I love the facility. As I mentioned in an earlier review I get my haircut at the Princess well for GREAT hair color Amanda is your girl...She works at Lifetime Fitness. She travels all over the place mostly to New York to work with Models doing hair and make up before photo shoots. She does AWESOME COLOR, she worked at the Princess before Lifetime. Anyhow she is a hidden treasure TRUST ME!  Other than that my son who is 12 has a great trainer "Chris Miller" other than being uber cute he has done wonders for my son and is great to work with. He is always on time, and has SO much patience.   I'm not a huge fan of the pool in the summer it is like Santa Monica Beach in the summer "You try and find a place to sit down???" but the kids like the slides and I'd prefer Lifetime then the public pool...It is clean, has lifeguards and comfy lounge chairs.  I'm all about the fitness can't you tell???

What a great restaurant this is... I've eaten here twice. Once on New Years Eve and Once for my Birthday and both time they get a WOOHOO!!! Can they even make a bad meal? I think not! The new deal for summer was INCREDIBLE $39.95 for 5 courses and NO skimping on this! 1 app, 1 salad, 1 main course, 1dessert and coffee awesome eh The app and salad are a little smaller but who would want a giant size anyhow. This is a place I would send anyone to, especially someone I liked :) I for sure give my thumbs up ALL THE WAY!!!

We went into Lorenzo's not knowing it was under new ownership.  The food was fantastic...The service wasn't great however to be fair they were short staffed. We totally enjoyed our food. I had a Calzone, and my husband and the kids shared a 16" pizza. Enough for everyone. We had a BLAST. The owner was so cool and they DELIVER YEAH!!! I'm so excited to have a new option for N. Scottsdale that will deliver and be SUPER YUMMY :)

So I've been saying for a year now that I do NOT need glasses to anyone that will listen. I mean really I am only 37...So begrudgingly I made the appointment. I found them through my insurance company plus I had seen the shop in the FRY'S shopping center.   They are a cute little place with a wide variety of killer glasses so I figured if nothing else maybe I would pick myself up another pair of shades...  Well no such luck I had the appointment and wouldn't you know it I need glasses not only for distance but for close up as well. Darn it...My husband was right and I'm NEVER going to live this one down.  The optomistrist is awesome super friendly and thorough and has a great bedside (chairside) manner.   Brad her business partner and the guy who runs everything up front is a hoot and knows everything there is to know about fashion and insurance so what more could one want. He helped me pick out two great pairs of glasses and worked within a fair budget since I had to get two pairs. He also was able to take my Chanel Sunglasses and put new prescription lenses in them.  This was awesome I was thrilled. Today is Tuesday and everything will be back for me on Friday ready for me to wear...As mad as I am that I need to wear glasses I'm thrilled that I'll be able to see and that I'll look fabulous...Thanks Brad and I can't wait to tell everyone how great a find this place is...

If I had to write a review for EVERYTIME I come here well...anyway. I drive thru pretty much every morning however if the line is too long (Which often times it is depending on who is running it) I will pop in for my Venti no foam latte with 3 sugars in the raw. For those of you who tell me there is no foam in a latte Just zip it there is and Starbucks puts a ton of it in unless you tell them not to OK! Anyhow they are always SO nice there, never a problem...if they make a mistake they always fix it. One day they found out I was buying some coffee for the teacher and so they gave me a bunch of brand new drinks they had made wrong (All hot) and said here give them to the teachers they deserve it! How nice is that?  Ya don't get service like that very often. I found a home for every one of them. I had like 6 coffees plus the two I bought...Anyway very convenient and always friendly!

Very clean, casino isn't very smoky they have a great duct system.  The beds OMG to die for...I swear I had the best sleep in ages. The room is ultra modern everything is handled from the remote control. The spa was OK not wonderful. I had to hear about the massage therapists dead dogs I wasn't thrilled with that especially when I was there to relax but otherwise it was great :)

I've eaten here numerous times and offered my opinion. The last two times sealed it for me I can't put myself through another meal. The food orders are often made wrong the service is terrible and even if it is a local business it's just plain not good.

A great moving company and one I would recommend to everyone. Creative Moving and Packing was so helpful and had great communication. They were efficient, personable and were all full time employees that obviously knew each other well as they worked so well as a team. A moving company I would always recommend.

Here is a place that we love to go with the family...We tend to remortgage the house ever time we visit but hey with the current economic crisis who doesn't???  It was a place we went all the time but lately not as often, not because the food isn't excellent but because it is quite pricey.   The service is great, Hudson the manager is great, very friendly and always comes to say hello. He knows us by name and enjoys our friendly banter.  The pizza is VERY fresh, the place is always immaculate and I've never had a problem with the food. If you are looking for great pizza this is the place, if you are looking for cheap well I'm afraid it isn't.   They do have a frequent stamp program and using that will save you a few bucks in the long run.

Went for dinner had reservations asked on the phone if this was like a benihana japanese steak house the lady said yes just like it. The food was really good however the ambiance was stiff and not fun. It was VERY pricey 4oz steak was $66 a la carte. We asked if it was appropriate for a child they said sure it was NOT...The server didn't know about sake, any of the wines or even what kind of drinks they had. The chef was meticulous to a point where it was painful to watch it took so long to get anything. Three hours later we JUST made it to our show...Wouldn't go there again.

Amazeballs seriously  I'm a carnivore granted the burgers OMG so good. Fresh with just the right amount of saltiness and grease yes in a good way. For you PMS'ers out there it's a must have. Fries are great and according to my daughter the salted caramel milkshake was beyond good.  So five stars is only fair...

I found Helena on YELP and her reviews were amazing. My daughter needed a prom dress fitted quickly as we had bought her 3 online and none of them fit her. Helena has her try them on and helped her pick the right one that would flatter her figure the best. My daughter isn't like most teenagers she's a curvy girl and Helena made her feel so good and so comfy and the end result is a beautiful dress that fits great and a 16 year old with a big smile on her face. She was super quick and extremely professional. Love Her!

With the word Kale in the name I was nervous I'd be served a piece of lettuce and a lemon wedge. Boy was I wrong. We had a wonderful lunch and a great wrap I was pleasantly surprised. Glad I went in and experienced the place instead of dismissing it as TOO healthy. Great spot

Great breakfast spot if you have a couple of hours. It's a very small space and everyone and their brother is trying to get in. With summer coming it will only get worse as the inside is quite small. It's very telling however because the food is yummy. Great spot once we were seated and got our food. Very strong coffee. Ask for some extra cream.
