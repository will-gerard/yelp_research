Such an easy experience here renting a car.  I am a Blue Chip member and I make my reservations online so my car is always ready and waiting for me.  The shuttle drivers are super friendly and ready and willing to give advice on the best way to get back to the rental car place, etc.  Their cars are always clean and in good condition and you never have to wait long for the shuttle to pick you up or drop you back off at the airport!

I really enjoyed this hotel.  I had a king one bedroom suite so the living room was seperate from the bedroom with a full kitchen as well.  (I am only docking one star as the walls were a little thin and I could hear my neighbors.)  I also had a generous-sized private patio area.  It was nice to be able to leave the door open and enjoy some fresh air for once in a hotel room.  However, I did spy a little field mouse outside so if you are on the bottom level you might want to monitor how long you leave to door open!  I will be back for work in a couple of months and I plan to stay here again!

eh, not really impressed.  my room featured the movie, "toys" starring Robin Williams.  Really?  the shower was terrible, the pipes woke me up in the middle of night with a horrible screeching noise.  also, the layout of this hotel is weird and i got terribly lost trying to find the check-in.  not a fav!

Wasn't overly impressed by the service here.  Ordered a house margarita which tasted more like margarita mix than anything.  Not sure if the better margaritas would be much different.    Also ordered the chicken burrito bowl.  It had queso on top that tasted like cheese whiz.  Took 20 minutes to get a tiny order of chips and salsa.  They were somewhat on the busy side but there were plenty of tables open so I am sure this restaurant has been busier before.  Plenty of servers, I had at least four different people at my table.  I just couldn't get anyones attention when I needed them.  Oh and everything is served in styrofoam, yuck.
