Made the trek over to That's a Wrap from my Tempe office for lunch today.  Even though it honestly doesn't take that long it was well worth it.   I went with a buddy who has actually had them cater a luncheon for a client which also went very well. Today I ordered the "Birds the Word". The chicken was moist, flavorful and fresh. In addition since it wasn't filled with rice it was the right amount of food. Compliment that with a fresh side of fruit, I had a winner!   My buddy got the Cypress salad. Not only was the salad the size of my head but it looked very fresh and he mentioned it had good flavor.  In total for both of us it was around $20 including drinks. A great go to spot in the valley!

When I was in college down at U of A some fraternity brothers and I stumbled across an old fashioned barber who finished off a good cut with a straight edge razor shave and hot towel. Ever since then any other haircut doesn't compare.   So I move up to Scottsdale and get turned onto V's Barbershop by my new boss. He had been going there forever so the day he took me it was like a right of passage, the good ole' boys you know the Italian Mafia....well here it is the Russian Mafia.   I got recommended to Rony he runs the second chair as you walk in, that was three years ago and I haven't got a haircut from anyone since. Rony is a great barber. He remembers your cut, style, and birthday and has one of the largest client portfolios I have ever heard of. If your in a rush and dire need of a cut Rony will fit you in staying late or coming in early. The guys in there are great, the customer service is excellent and you get that old school feel.   Yes it is located next to a busy restaurant with Arcadia Tavern but they do help you out with free valet. If you are looking for a good haircut go to V's on Indian School and ask for Rony.

I hate those automatic car washes. They are $20 bucks scratch up your car and most of the time don't get all the dirt off. I have driven by Arcadia Car Wash a bunch of times but never stopped. I am glad   finally did.   This is a true hand car wash for only $17 bucks! You pull into a shaded area and they go to work. Then they start the drying process with an air compression hose and finish up with an interior detail. They left my car looking great!   The only warning is make sure you have some time to kill. They do a great job but only have spots two wash to cars at a time. For me its worth the wait!

Stopped in here with the boss lady, I am talking about my real boss not the girlfriend, the other day for lunch. We were in the middle of Mesa and overcome by corporate restaurants so I turned to Yelp as my foodie Northern Star to lead us safely!   All the reviews raved about this place and I would agree. Now I have to admit I am kind of a Scottsdale snob, the only reason I go below the 202 is for work. So I already had a pessimistic attitude about finding a good place to eat in Mesa/Gilbert that wasn't Joe's. I am glad to say I was  wrong.   We got there right at noon and the crowd wasn't that bad. The first thing that hits you is the cool hipster vibe they have going in there. Great layout clean and very inviting. Next step you grab a menu decide what you want pay then find your own seats.  I went with the Turkey Sandwich with blue cheese caramelized pecans onions on sourdough. It was pretty good. The turkey was moist and the toppings all worked well with each other. But it could have used MORE turkey and the bread was a little dry. I think next time I would go with the burger or chicken sandwich everyone raves about on here.   Overall a great diner that I would go back to and drive somewhat out of the way for!

So I have been to Roaring Fork twice and the second time saved it in my opinion. I went last year for my birthday with a group of 10 and didn't get the best service. However much like Gabi M. the Sunday night Happy Hour has won me over.   After a day by the pool my buddy and I were driving around trying to think of somewhere different in Old Town to eat. Now we are wearing board shorts and not dressed for your typical night at RF but we gave it a shot anyway.   We walked in and sat right at the bar. We were greeted by bartender Ryan who was awesome. He offered us the great happy hour menu which included some of the better Green Chile Stew I have had $5 glasses of wine that you can't beat. We had 6 glasses total and an entree each and our bill was $35, you can't beat that. If you are looking for a well priced meal with a good server head to RF and ask for Ryan behind the bar you won't be disappointed.

So I was sitting at home the other day flipping through the TV channels and landed on the food network..weird. It was a Bobby Flay throwdown for Pad Thai. After watching the full episode it got me craving the classic dish. I fought off the temptation for two hours (I mean pool season is rapidly approaching ) but finally gave in. So I turned over to my trusty Yelp app and Tottie's came up as the overall favorite, I can now see why.  So I went for pick up and was greeted straight away. They took my Chicken Pad Thai order (no egg...I know a staple to the dish but I can't stand them) and had it ready within 10 minutes. I went 20 mph over the speed limit the whole way home because the smell was killing me. Finally I dug in and it was everything i was looking for. I went with medium spicy and it was perfect. Just enough spice compared to sweet. A large portion size for the price and the noodles were perfectly cooked. Sorry Pei Wei you just lost a Pad Thai customer.

Zipps is a local favorite and honestly has the best wings I have ever had. Between their 32 ounce beers, medium golden honey wings and happy hour specials this is the place to be for sports events.   It does get packed quickly and the TV selection is a little iffy at the Camelback location but the food and atmosphere make up for it!

You should go to Defalco's if any of the following apply to you:  1. You have been to Italy before and you want to relive that Italian food adventure but not leaving the confines of South Scottsdale 2. You want to have some of the best Italian Beef or Philly Cheesteaks sandwiches you have ever had.  3. You are in no rush for your meal  I have been to Defalco's over 15 times while leaving in Phoenix. Their food is superb, the staff is friendly and the experience is always consistent. The only glaring problem, which they address with a sign on their front door, is it takes FOREVER.   This is the closest you are going to get to an Authentic Italian Delicatessen in Phoenix.  The food while eating there is delicious but I would also suggest having them set you up with a Pizza Kit so you can make authentic Italian pizza at home. It is delicious easy and very affordable.   However if you are a cheesesteak lover and you go to Defalco's and don't order it is a sin. It is a huge hot messy mouth watering I can't believe I finally found such a delicious sandwich.   The portions are huge so keep that in mind and it's not the cheapest or quickest place. But it is the BEST Italian Deli I have been to in PHX.

So I hate breakfast let me start there. I consider myself a foodie but there are so many things I won't eat..bananas, avocados...but most importantly eggs and breakfast.   Now since you have got past my first section you must still be relatively interested on how I can give Harlow's 5 Stars when its a breakfast spot. First off the tradition. Harlow's has been a staple in Tempe for years. It looks something you would find in the woods and is super welcoming. Also for the guys out there not only is the food great but a majority of the support staff is also excellent.   Now this place does get slammed so be prepared for a potential wait. I have only gone during the week with clients and at the most its been 5-10 minutes. Since I don't like most breakfast food I also go with the corned beef hash or the green chile burrito. They are both amazing and you leave not only feeling full but prepared for an afternoon nap.   All in all you NEED to try Harlows you won't regret it.

I had no lunch plans and was looking for a new spot. Now I must admit that this was before I had been turned onto Yelp so I was still relying on colleague recommendations.   Having grown up on Middle Eastern food any opportunity I get to take down an authentic Gyro I won't pass up. So my buddy Dan and I go to one of his old local favorites Haji-Baba.   I order the Gyro and fries and was blown away. The price was cheap; the meat was well seasoned and thinly sliced. I hate it when they slice it too thick.  All in all I had a great time the only reason why it didn't get five stars is it took a while because it was slammed during lunch. But if you work anywhere near ASU in Tempe and are craving a good Gyro don't think twice...Haji Baba.

Went to lunch at Los Dos Molinos today and was impressed once again. I always like to ask the server what their favorite thing on the menu is and hate it when I get the most expensive response, today I didn't! I was recommended to the Chicken Enchilada plate. I am normally not an enchilada type of guy, not enough substance for me and usually too much tortilla. However these proved me wrong.  The enchiladas were piled high with moist shredded chicken and covered in Green Chile(not for the faint if heart). Then it was all brought together by melted cheese which was crisped to perfection. Another great experience at Los Dos however if this is your first time there is a reason why each table gets its own pitcher of water!

So I don't even eat Sushi. I know I know people are now swearing at me and saying not nice things under their breath about how can I even review a Sushi spot when I don't eat Sushi?!  Well I am not the only one out there that doesn't eat Sushi its an epidemic and us not Sushi eating Homosapiens feel like outcasts at times cause we are "those people" Well "those people" Blue Wasabi is your answer!   They have a great happy hour where a bunch of the small plates are at a great price. But the thing that I loved was they had "Sushi" with cooked food in it like the chicken roll! So when the whole table ordered Sushi I no longer was that guy!   The food has great taste, the names of the rolls are awesome and the atmosphere is trendy. Outside of happy hour the prices can get a little pricey around 10-12 a roll but worth it

MAN BUZZ! The breakfast buzz is the ultimate meat head drink. I mean espresso protein and smoothie all in one? Can't beat it!   I have had many things on the menu here and all good. The bowls are awesome the breakfast club is out of this world and the veggie wrap add chicken(come on gotta do it!) is also awesome. Great drink selection, if you like Arnold Palmers ask for the Tiger Woods the next time you go in. E  Atmosphere is super laid back with a great stay. This is the only thing to warn you about it can take some time if you don't call ahead but its worth it!

So I had the grandparents (From England) and my mom in Town for the weekend. It was the last night before they left so I was looking for a good go to spot with moderate prices. When in doubt, I Yelped it out!   I came across St. Francis on Top 50 hottest restaurants in Phoenix. I looked over the reviews and was won over. The menu looked great, it was different from the standard OId Town Scottsdale scene we had done for the past three nights so I was sold.   As we arrived I was impressed right off the bat by the building. It has a unique modern look with a very open feel.  It is a two storied restaurant that probably fits around 75 people on each floor.   When we arrived I went with a fellow Yelper recommendation with the Meyers Lemonade. It was somewhat refreshing but the Honey was a little over powering for my taste.   For apps we order the Corn Chowder and the Goat Cheese to share. I always back and forth on Goat Cheese it's kind of like when you go on a date and it only goes ok you could live without seeing them again or you could see them again (kind of a stretch analogy I apologize) Regardless this Goat Cheese was out of this world. It was perfect melted temperature accented with basil and various with ingredients. The Corn Chowder was also very good. It was very light and not very filling which made it great as an app.   The table pretty much covered all the entrees ordering the Pot Roast, Cioppino, Roasted Chicken, Salmon Salad and finally I ordered the Hangar Steak. Everyone was very pleased with their meal. The Cioppino had a little Bobby Flay type spice to it so just a heads up. My Hangar Steak was awesome cooked perfectly and a good size.   Finally to top off the fat kid meal dessert. Now I am like many fellow yelpers and never order dessert....that's a lie I look at the dessert menu more than the entree menu. Now with my Grandparents are from England so they thought they would give their expert opinion on the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Much to my surprise they have it the thumbs up. It we a perfect temp, size, taste and the accent of the vanilla ice cream was perfect.   Now after writing a novel why did this only get four stars from me? Unfortunately the service wasn't the best. Our server acted like this was his first serving job. He just forgot a number of the basics we constantly needed to ask for i.e. spoons for soup, water and steak knives with dinner.   In the end I will come back to St. Francis without question!

The best Mediterranean food in the valley and the best owner. I got turned onto the Flaming Kabob from a work colleague who used them for catering and suggested I give them a shot.   Now I cater lunches for work daily and kind of expect to be let down when you order a mass of food...not here!   I always order the chicken kabobs, rice salad and hummus and it is amazing everytime! Khalil the owner is one of the nicest most accommodating people I have met. He makes his orders on time and is fair priced. Plus the food is delicious!   If you are looking to support a local business and are in the mood for Mediterranean make sure you even go out of your way to go to the Flaming Kabob!

A buddy and I went Lemongrass for lunch today. Now I have to admit I have drove by this place for the past 2 years since my office is right down the street. As I pulled up I figured this only has two options being great or making me feel like I need to take the afternoon off....  I don't know why I was surprised, other yelpers have said the same thing and I agree. This place is good. This is one of the better hole in the wall places I have been to in a while. I had the salad with Lemongrass Basil Chicken as my entrée and was very pleased. Now I did go with the spicy level 2 out of 3 but this isn't a true Thai scale in my mind. Next time I think I will go with the level 3. If you are looking for a fresh, filling and authentic Thai meal for a reasonable price in Tempe make your way over to Lemongrass.

OK I love sandwiches. I was the kid who had the same Turkey Sandwich everyday for lunch growing up by choice because I love sandwiches. Now with that being said I live near Old Town which is lacking a good sandwich spot in my opinion. So when my girlfriend and I stumbled upon this place thanks to Yelp! we were excited.   First of the place looks really cool. It looks like sharp and somewhere you would want to eat. It was a Sunday afternoon and we walked in around 2pm, the place was relatively empty. After we looked through the cold case and the menu we walked up to the counter and waited.....and waited....and waited. There were 5 employees standing right in front of us really enjoying themselves until one finally realized we had been waiting to order. We ordered panini style turkey sandwiches paid and sat at the counter top bar.   The food also took a while to come out. As we sat there we just watched the employees play on their phones, make fun of each other, hangout in the back and overall very unprofessional. When our $9 sandwiches finally arrived they were only OK. Nothing we couldn't have made at home with a $10 panini press from target some deli meat and bread.   It gets two stars because of the restaurant decor and OK food. The staff kills this place they are loud, unkept and unprofessional. I'll spend a few more dollars and go to many of the other great restaurants in Kierland.

So it's Saturday night. The girlfriend and I are watching our colleges play some top notch basketball while having a few adult beverages. After one school wins, mine U of A, we decide it's time for dinner. Well what  goes better with basketball and beers than pizza? We were proven very wrong......   So we ordered Crust because her sister had a great pizza a week earlier  and it was close. We decided the classic Hawaiian pizza would hit the spot for us tonight. We called in and they said it would take around 20 minutes which was perfect.  We arrived just in time and bought our $25 pizza as it was coming out of the oven. We got home and opened up the anticipated box too see our classical favorite....needless to saw we were shocked.  Crust's take on a Hawaiian pizza is the biggest miss I have ever seen in a classic pizza. Don't get me wrong I appreciate a new twist on an old classic but this was sheer laziness. First off it's a square not round pizza this in my mind was a plus due to the thickness and crispiness. However that was the only plus to the whole pizza.   For those of you that went to public elementary school do you remember pizza day? Its was a square greasy piece of pizza with cubed pepperoni. Well the Hawaiian pizza at Crust isn't far off.  The pizza came out with 8 large slices and a medium thick crust. The cheese and meat looked like deli slices you would pick up at safeway laid on top not even covering the pizza. The final touch was canned cubed pineapple on top of the deli meat and cheese.  If you are looking for a $25 pizza your toddler can make but want to call it a Scottsdale fusion then I suggest you run to Crust. If not then I  would suggest Papa Johns....they deliver....

So I decided that this Friday night I was skipping the classic rotation of Drift, Junkie and Philly Cheese steaks for dinner with a good friend. Originally we were heading to Blanco (which I was not stoked about). I got Blanco at 7:45 and there was an hour wait for 2 people. My friend was running late so I launched my handy Iphone Yelp app and looked up the J. Alexander's reviews. Five minutes later my friend showed up and we were walking into J. Alexanders.   From the start I did feel the comparison to Bandera and Houston's however I felt like J.A was much more open. The hostess was very friendly and sat us right away.   Here is what sealed the 5 star rating, the service. Our server was named Ryan and he was on point. He was quick to the table to ask us for our drink order of which he recommended a medium bodied Pinot Noir. He then took our whole food order. I was a little nervous about that but he timed the food perfectly which allowed for a mainly uninterrupted dinner. The only time he bothered us was to refill our glass (which never bothers me) and clean our table.   I had the filet medium with mashed potatoes. The steak was great and cooked to perfection. My friend Kate had the prime rib, rare. Now I think it was cooked well...actually not sure here it came out so bloody I thought it was still mooing but she enjoyed it. We finished the meal with one of the best pieces of carrot cake I have ever had, I don't even like carrot cake. It isn't your typical carrot cake it comes out warm with melted icing which tastes similar to the icing found on a Cinna-Bun Cinnamon Roll.   All in all I would highly recommend JA. The service, food and atmosphere were great!

A colleague and I went to ATS yesterday for lunch and again were very pleased with the meal. Now I am not a small appetite and it may be because the food is super good but the only downfall is the size of the tacos. However we both got the Taco Tuesday deal which you can't beat. The Carne was well marinated and cooked to perfection. The place is small so if you happen to go there on a hot summer day during a lunch rush you may not have the best experience however we sat outside on the patio and enjoyed a great lunch. This is one of my top go to spots for Carne Asada in Phoenix.  My colleague had been there before and got the Torta and said it was awesome as well!

The Family came in town this past weekend but before they booked they were looking for a good recommendation. It was going to be my brother who is lower 20's my mom and my grandparents. So I was thinking middle of summer grandparents who aren't going to hike camelback by any means where would be a good spot? Montelucia it is!   First off they got a great deal which added to the value. In regards to their stay they couldn't have been happier. The amenities were top notch. The happening pool was just the right amount of craziness that didn't turn off my grandparents but kept my younger brother happy. On Friday nights they have a live band which was great. All in all a somewhat great experience.   So like I said earlier they got a great deal through Expedia. This is where the Montelucia loses a star. When my family was checking out they hit them with a number of "resort fees" which in the end totaled up to another $100 or so dollars. It was a crazy amount but still the principle that they weren't expecting that.   However with that being said I would recommend the Montelucia due to their service, amenities and dedication to being the top resort in PHX.

Ok I am a Scottsdale Snob I will admit it. I do think the Scottsdale scene is more fun the other areas in Phoenix. However with that being said even the best scenes need a break. The Lodge is a perfect spot for that break.   The Lodge is what I would call a high class dive bar. Now many people are probably thinking "Andrew D. that's an oxymoron isn't it?" My answer to that is as follows: 1. The Lodge is a place where you can go in the morning in your clothes from the night before and you will fit in.  2. The Lodge is a place where if you are all dialed up in your Scottsdale Fashion you can hit as a cheap pre-game spot and not feel out of place.  3. The Lodge is the place that has some of the best bar food I have eaten  4. Do you have an itch to play an old fashioned game of darts with your buddies while surrounded by the beautiful crowd of Scottsdale's Finest. The Lodge is your answer  So if you are looking for that mountainous getaway but are afraid to drive higher that Cave Creek. Stop at the Lodge for great food, spiked hot chocolate and the beauty of Scottsdale.

People always say that some of the best things they have experienced are run by people who have a passion for their product. That is what sets the Daily Dose apart from other Old Town food spots. Both the restaurant manager and head chef are there all day everyday making sure every meal is great.   Now the Daily Dose as a number of things going for it: 1. They are one of the only breakfast spots in Old Town. The breakfast is always good and creative...I mean they have breakfast nachos!  2. They have great food other than breakfast. Typically when you have a restaurant that does breakfast their other food suffers. Not at the Daily Dose! Their Turkey Burger on the pretzel bun is incredible. Also if you have always wanted to try a veggie burger but just don't think you will like it don't hesitate at  DD. Their Veggie Burger is great!  3. Maybe the biggest selling point Happy Hour 7 days a week!   One quick tip if you are heading there on a weekend for breakfast make sure you are ready to wait at least 30 minutes. The Daily Dose is and will continue to be a go to spot for breakfast, lunch and dinner for me!

I have given this place 3 chances and it still disappoints me. The food is subpar, the ambiance is terrible and the servers are rude.   I was there a few weeks back and my friends and I after a night out were reminiscing and our waitress was the biggest snob listening into our conversation and giving her opinion.  She was rude enough to the point we almost walked out before our food, after a 45 minute wait, was even served.   This place won't last long in old town. With mediocre food at best, slow service and rude employees there are too many other great spots in old town people will venture to.

So I was turned onto Gallo Blanco by colleague and fellow Yelper Marcus D. and was very impressed.   I went there last Friday for lunch with a colleague of mine. Now when I first arrived I was a little skeptical because it is located inside a remodeled apartment complex turned hotel. Now when we got inside I was surprised how packed it was. We were forced to sit at the bar which actually turned out better because we got to chat with the staff and get the low down on the menu.   Ok so now to the food. Before I get to that I need to paint you a picture. So my colleague and I are not fat kids by any means but we are also not 110 Emo skater kids who don't eat. So when we asked our server how many tacos he usually eats and he recommended four we were shocked so we went with three....well we should have gone with 8 each. The tacos are served street style, hence why they are only two bucks each.   The thing is we probably could have eaten 8 each not only because of the size but because of how good these tacos were. I had the pork and carna asada tacos. Both were amazing. The salsas they give you to add were also fantastic. The only thing we tried that I wouldn't recommend is the fried cheese crisp as an app. It is basically fried cheese they give you in a cool presentation with a queso dip. It was just too much cheese, next time I would pass.   All in all I would highly recommend this place. Don't let the outside fool you, this is not only a great restaurant but a pretty cool pool area at the hotel as well. If you are craving good tacos make it to Gallo Blanco.

The only thing that could make this place better is if Betty White walked into this former beauty parlor looking for a perm and staying for a beer.   I mean there is over 400 reviews what more can I add? The food is awesome. We went with the corn pizza add bacon add chicken....ya we did it and it was amazing!  The service is great ,the atmosphere is cool and the pizza rivals the overrated Mr. Bianco. The only down side is everyone knows how good this is so make sure you plan ahead you could be faced with a well worth it wait.

So is it awkward that I may have fallen in love with a 50 year old hispanic lady named Selena?  You wouldn't think so if you met her and tasted her food at Mesquite Grill. I went there for lunch today after seeing it on Yelp's hottest restaurants and was very impressed.   When I arrived it was empty so that is never a good sign. But Selena put my worries behind me. She recommended the combo platter which consisted of a carne asada taco, chicken taco, beans and rice. The tacos were out of this world. They weren't your typical street style tacos; they are so big they are almost like mini burritos. The rice and beans were good but nothing out of this world.   Selena makes all the food fresh in the back and you can tell. If you are deciding between the Chipotle just across the parking lot or Sonora Mesquite...there is no question go say hi to Selena.

So you know when you drive by a bad car accident you don't want to slow down and look but you always do? Or maybe that feeling of how embarrassed you are about the fact  that you do stay up late at night watching a random Steven Segal movie on AMC when it's on? Well that's my same feeling towards Cactus I hate it but am now addicted!   If you are new to Crossfit the first month is probably the biggest challenge. Every studio has its own tweak on the Crossfit foundation philosophies. Every studio has its own personality and Cactus is no different.   I was turned onto Cactus after winning a 6 month Express package at a 20/30 Silent Auction event. Now to give you some background on me I had only done Crossfit  at another studio once before and was turned off by it but I thought I would give this another shot.   The best  part about the studio is the community they have created and how  welcoming they are to new Crossfitters. You start hearing words that sound painful like MRAP(which depending on the workout will hurt for a few days) double unders, thrusters ( I thought I was working out not doing the mattress mambo?!) etc....But the best part is everyone in that room started with the same awkward confusing thoughts you are having during your introduction.   The second best part is the owner Kevin Cherrick. He is just like every client in his gym but you can feel the passion, excitement and support through the workouts. He wont make you do anything that will physically hurt you and will guide you make sure you are using the right form and technique.Once you find that weight that works for your workout he is going to push you.   I would recommend Cactus to anyone interested in Crossfit. This welcoming studio with a great location, reasonable prices and accommodating class times makes it a no brainer!

So I have started to come to the realization that I am getting older. What is it that made me start to accept this fact? The two day hangover.  The two day hangover is very similar to the one day hangover including the cravings for some of the greasiest, not good for the pool body, food you can find, that's where Lobby's comes into play.  After another long but epic weekend in old town I found myself reminiscing about the blurry weekend with my coworker on Monday morning. The next thing you know lunch had arrived. With that two day hangover still lingering for both of us we agreed grease is the answer.  Thanks to fellow yelpers I came across Lobby's on the top ten hottest restaurants. Now I work in Tempe and the food selection in my opinion is far from stellar so I when I saw Lobby's only a few blocks from the office I was sold.  Now I am a California guy grew up in Nor Cal so no true passion for Midwest food other than the fact that every time I have had it I was happy with the results. This is no exception.  We walk in and are greeted by the owner. I look at the simple yet delicious looking menu and just stare. He can tell I am having some trouble so to ease my pain he suggest a full  Spicy Italian Beef  sandwich full dip with fries and a drink. Without hesitation I agree.  This by far one of the best Italian beef sandwiches I have had. The beef was tender; the bread was great and the spicy peppers gave it the kick it needed. I know the full dip is the classical way to go but I would probably go California style next time and get the au jus on the side got a little to soggy for my taste. Honestly if I could make up cool phrases like Guy Fieri does on Triple D I would use everyone I had here. This is a must hit in the East Valley. Sorry Luke's the competition has arrived.....

Other than the fact that I should have brushed up on my Rosetta Stone Spanish Edition before trying to find La Condessa I can honestly say I haven't had better tacos in PHX.  The place is a little hard to find if it's your first time so after multiple turn arounds and a stop at the Panaderia to ask for directions my colleague and I arrived at taco bliss.   The meal starts off with an endless bowl of fresh tortilla chips and a salsa bar that would make Bobby Flay  jealous. They had some of the best homemade salsas with a large variety. From your classic Pico De Gallo to a Creamy Cilantro salsa.   I ordered the two taco platter with a tinga taco and a carne asada Taco. These were both great. The carne asada was a little dry for my taste but with the assist of the homemade salsa's it was a perfect combo. The tinga taco was a perfect combination of slowly cooked shredded chicken and seasoning. My colleague got a carne asada burrito and a tinga taco and was satisfied by both.   In short if I am looking for a great taco for a good price I am going back to La Condesa.

Urban 7 I really want to like you but I cant. Went there for a mid week happy hour. The crowd was non-existent the service was good but awkward. May give it one more shot to redeem but for now 2 stars.

Looking for a great Mexican restaurant downtown? Look no further than Verde.   Verde has something that other restaurants don't, the relaxed atmosphere of casual dining with high end service. There are no pesky waiters to deal with or over crowded tables.    This was my first time at Verde and naturally as I walked in I asked the Owner , who was working the counter, what he would recommend. Hands down he mentioned the Green Chile was the most popular. Luckily I had a fellow foodie with me who doesn't miss an opportunity to try as many things as he can on a menu so I got to experience all of it.   I got the green chili and couldn't have been happier. The meat was tender, the portions were generous and it had just the right amount of heat. In addition to that the homemade tortilla and Mexican cola to wash it down sealed the deal for me. This green chile is a winner!   My colleague ordered the green chile, red chile and the chili lime rotisserie chicken.  The red chile was ok but a little over spiced I would go with the green over the red any day. The chicken on the other hand was an awesome rotisserie chicken but lacked the spice or flavor I was looking for to give it that Mexican flavor.   All  in all I would go back to Verde in a second. I know they are working on completing the full experience with adding adult beverages....so you can't drink beer there now but when you can you will drink Dos Equis!....

So Scottsdale needs a good sports bar....so I REALLLY wanted to like Blue 32.  But in the end I am not very impressed.   Let's start with the first thing that sets the tone for your dining experience, the hostess and wait staff. This was my third time there and we arrived during Saturday College Football. It was me and three buddies. The hostess had no idea what was going on and she was walking us to a table in the bar when two other people took it from right in front of us. Instead of her telling them to get up she made us wait. We waited for close to an hour.   Finally we get a seat at the bar. Now the TV situation at Blue 32 ss great...if you have an in with the guy managing the TV Remote. We were there for the GAME OF THE WEEK and they insisted the ASU vs NO ONE CARES game was more important. I don't think the bar manager got the memo that 85% of the US who watches college sports was watching the game of the week.   Now to the food. Decent not great. I have had their tacos, wings and burgers all of which were nothing but mediocre at best.   If I could fuse the set up of Blue 32 with the food from Zipps or Goldies then we would have a real Scottsdale Sports Bar. For now we are stuck with this....

After an event at the Montelucia my girlfriend and I headed to old town with another couple looking for a good dinner spot. We ended up at the Citizen House on their one month anniversary.  The first thing was the service was great. As soon as we walked in we were greeted and sat. Within minutes we had a server taking our drink orders and asking for apps. The only negative is the kitchen still may be learning because our food took a while.  We ordered the fondue and popcorn for apps and they were both great. The only thing is they don't give you enough dipping food for the fondue but bring you extra for more money. The popcorn was unreal I mean bacon flavored popcorn who could ask for more?  For entrees our table ordered the scallops, chicken and chopped salad. All received great reviews. For dessert we order the bread pudding which was good not great. The bread pudding was a little bland but the makers mark ice cream was great.   I will be making the Citizen House a regular stop in my old town dinner rotation.

So everyone in Old Town has been waiting for a good sports bar forever. When everyone heard Thunder Dan was coming to town the excitement starting buzzing. Well this time Thunder Dan didn't hit this buzzer beater.  First off it does get two stars for a reason so lets start there. The atmosphere is great. The venue is super cool and there is tons of tvs.   Thats pretty much where it stops. The food isn't great and is relatively slow. I have had a burger, wings, the chicken quesadilla and a couple of other things which didn't impress me. Plus the service was super slow...  This kind of reminds me of the Suns-Bulls series super exciting but just misses the mark of greatness. I am sticking with my old faithful two blocks away Zipps.

Barneys has a unique set up. I guess for the older folk of Scottsdale this used to be the old dos gringos but I can tell you it was a good call by moving to their new location!   Barneys is 3 floors of confusion honestly. The service sucks, the food is terrible and the atmosphere is  weird.   Barneys Boathouse is gonna sink faster than the Titanic.

So its the third week of January and I like many of you have a new years resolution of getting into better shape. We can all go to the gym drink all the water we need and eat healthy when we plan, but what if that plan goes right out of the window due to your hectic daily life? I know what I do I tend to try and eat something fast that is "healthy" Well much to my surprise most fast "healthy " options are as about as healthy as a snickers bar.   But My Fit Foods is different. It is a great concept with pre-made, pre-portioned and delicious meals ready for you on the spot. They also have a very knowledgeable and approachable staff. Their staff doesn't try and corner you into buying a bunch of stuff that will be the answer to all of your problems.   I stopped in for a quick bite in between meetings  and was greeted immediately. I was recommend to the turkey meatloaf with sweet potato walnut mash. I was very happy with it and the price!   This place has a lot to offer that I haven't even had a chance to look at yet like their 21 day challenge, nutrition coaching and I am sure of a lot more. If you are looking for a well priced truly healthy meal for your on the go life style then My Fit Foods is your answer.

THE GERMANS ARE HERE THE GERMANS ARE HERE!!!(please read aloud in a German accent).  The Germans have arrived to Old Town Scottsdale and have brought their wieners with them. The Brathaus recently opened in the ever so familiar yet always at least hour wait location Oregano's used to be in.   First thing first I have to give kudos to whoever had the idea o get ride of those 4 parking spots Oregano's had and turned it into an open beer garden. Genius!   The Brathaus set up very similar to how Oregano's used to be expect now the building on the right is filled with 20+ craft international beers on tap. And if you want the true experience upgrade that craft beer to a DAS BOOT!  Now on to the food. A relatively simple menu and its exactly what you think brats, burgers and boxed water? Ya they have boxed water apparently its the best water in the world....for $10 a case it better be the drinking fountain of youth.   The bottom line is you get  a choice of brat from spicy, beer, sweet...the list goes on. Then you get a choice of traditional toppings 3 are included each one after that is .75cents a piece. For your side I would recommend sharing a large fries and make sure to ask for the dipping sauces they are awesome!   My brat was good I got a beer brat with sauerkraut relish and spicy pickles. It was cooked well, toppings were good and plentiful. If I had to critique I would say the bun was a little dry but that's if I had to say something.   Now we went on day 5 of them being open so talking about the service isn't totally fair so I'll be nice. The service was pretty lets say overwhelmed. We waited in front of the bar for close to 30 minutes before the bartender even noticed us. Then the food took a while but everything did come out right the first time. However I will say  our server was working his tail off to make sure everything was right so his effort offset the delays.   I will be going back to the BratHaus and hope this one of a kind spot in Scottsdale stays around for a while. I mean you can't beat a good beer and a brat.

Scottsdale has so many fufu fancy fusion style twisty no look resaturants. It is a breath of fresh  air to get a NEW restaurant that stays true to its classical Mexican roots.   ATS hit a homerun not only with the food and service but also the location. The Carne Asada burritos as well as the Pollo Asada are phenomal. I also go XL on the food trust me you won't regret it. The food leaves you full and not bloated like many other Mexican restaurants around Old Town.   The back patio as a cool ambiance and is a great place to get out of the Old Town scence for a second. The chips and salsa are delicious and they also have a good quesadilla. I would recommend this place when your looking for a good go to Mexican meal.
