Dr. Patel is a great Doctor... one of the most thorough that I have ever been to. He's also very convenient and practical with his scheduling, diagnoses, and treatments.

Southwest Airlines used to be the ONLY airline I would fly.... But over the years they have become a total joke. My flight is delayed legitimately 50% of the time.   Additionally, figure out your boarding system.   Update your entire fleet.   Use your brain and not your policies when dealing with passengers.   It's been real... It's been fun.... Hasn't been real fun. See ya later, you circus of an airline!

I've been shopping here since I was literally a small child. Staff is great. Environment is great. Merchandise is great- for the most part.... Then there's the produce.... WHAT in the the H - E DOUBLE HOCKEY STICKS?! Every time I buy avocados or kiwis they are like genetic mutants with no flavor and an awful texture... It's been MANY times over multiple years. Now the asparagus and Brussels sprouts are the same. I'm NEVER going to purchase produce here again because Costco is clearly working with some sub par supplies that are likely genetically modifying crops to yield better harvests and meet their mass demand for quantity. This is real bad. Come on Costco.... Besides that I love your store ; )

This company is a JOKE... avoid it if at all possible. Simply put, they're overpriced "leaches" who do a horrible job "managing" any community they touch.

Formally Dannys family car wash, now jacksons... This place marches to the beat of their own drum. I've seen paint dry faster than my car after what was supposed to be a quick wash. They let three other cars pass me in the line... There was over spray of Nasty armorall oil all over my seats doors and dash... I pointed it out to them, they made a half hearted attempt to wipe it down... Ultimately I don't have time for this crap so I left. They simply don't have any attention to detail and could care less about working quickly.

Just a quick update - southwest is still a joke. Still on another old piece of garbage plane with no wifi - still held up with delays.

I've been coming here at least once a week for over 5 years  (no lie). I LOVE the concept. But truth be told, the only reason I come back now is out of convenience.   The only thing consistent with the store is the 25% markup on everything they sell and a complete lack of any produce or other fresh goods that you would expect from a "Farmers market".   You guys are on the right track and I will continue to support you as a convenience store. But C'maaan, pour some passion into your offerings.   Figure it out - capitalize by increasing your inventory of unique fresh/organic produce and focus on seasonal consistency. BE A PURVEYOR!  *Side note, If your aim is to stay a convenience store - Start selling alcohol too!

Consistently the WORST banking experience I've ever had... They somehow find a way to get worse every single time I visit.   No parking, no customer service, nobody around to help.   Most recently, while waiting for a business banker I was past up intentionally three times. They only have one banker and nobody appears to be knowledgeable on anything.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this bank at all costs.
