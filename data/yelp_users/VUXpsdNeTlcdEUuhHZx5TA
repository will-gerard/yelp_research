I ordered two ribeye steaks, med-rare, baked potatoes.  The steaks were not rare, they were raw. The potatoes were not even cooked, hard as a rock. One potato was the size of a lemon, the other was a huge baker. The manager was not apologetic and flip, and advised we were free to drive back down to the restaurant to have it re-cooked. We had ordered it to go, so driving back to the restaurant I've miles at eight pm, didn't sound like a great plan.  The attitude from Jason the manager just added insult to injury.  The dessert and salad were great.

Food is very good, and portions are large.  Staff is wonderful! The baked manicotti, pizza and the steamed clams are all awesome.

I couldn't decide whether to leave three or four stars. I think the food is primarily decent, although the appetizers could certainly use some work. The waitstaff is always phenomenal, and very charming. The last time we were there, we sat on the patio near the fireplace and all staff was very accommodating ensuring that we had a fire, and keeping it going throughout the night.  That being said, for those who have been here, the kitchen is set up in the middle of the dining area which is wonderful for the patrons who would like to watch their meal prepared.   However, we instead had the pleasure of watching the head chef flirting with a very young waitress for several hours, and not tending to the kitchen or staff as one would expect. It had gone on so long, I couldn't believe that he was even working in the kitchen, let alone the head chef.   I actually asked around, and learned that this is par for the course, and complaints have been made yet have gone ignored regarding his behavior.  I understand the chef is young but he could certainly take a tip from chefs such as Christopher fromChristopher's at the Biltmore. Patrons generally like a chef to make the rounds asking how their  meal was and checking on quality, rather than attempting to hit on young waitstaff in view of the entire restaurant.  Just a thought. One that apparently has been raised several times and gone ignored.  As for the food, I have had all the steaks, the baked chicken, and the asparagus-all fantastic.  The wild mushrooms, every time I ordered them have tasted unwashed. I want to love them so much, I can't figure out what the issue is.  I think there's some minor tweaks needed, but I still feel like this is one of the best places on the west side.

I ordered sushi last night, I got horrendous food poisoning.  I have eaten sushi for 15 years and this is the first time I became violently ill.  I became horribly sick within the hour. The cramps were excruciating. The other food is ok, but the sushi is so sub-standard even in taste, I am amazed they can keep their doors open.

Three words: Are you joking?! So, so good. Menu is decent, staff is professional, knowledgable and very friendly.  The food was delectable. I am very picky and almost always send food back. I tasted everything and it was all on point.  Only suggestion is to turn the music down and switch up the play list.  Drinks were fresh and yummy.

The pastries and chocolate are synonymous to art. Stunning yet delectable. I stopped in on a whim, and ended up buying $68 worth of product. I was hopeful that I had not made a mistake by purchasing so much without having tasted the pastries, cupcakes etc. Every single item that I had purchased was without a doubt probably the best I have had, anywhere.

The seafood cocktails are plentiful, and tasty. The micheladas are ridiculously on point. The garlic shrimp is consistently delish. The staff is very friendly and courteous. The seafood platter was a good deal and a lot of food!

Mitch's BBQ is absolutely delicious.  And I can BBQ & smoke my own- but why would I?  Everything is amazing. Turkey, chicken, pulled pork, ribs-all decadent. The beans and other sides too, simply perfect.  I ate the leftovers for a week, no joke.

I came in at 8 and was there two hours. There were three patients ahead of us.  The front office staff was incredibly rude, unprofessional and seemingly just an unhappy person. She violated HIPPA laws by yelling at another patient clear across the lobby. I felt she deliberately kept me waiting longer as it was evident I was upset by her treatment of me.   I was told by the (Nurse Practitioner-to be clear there were no doctors at this location) she had been there a long time and it was not the first time someone reported her rudeness.  Other patients left while I was there rather than wait although it was dead by then. The medical assistant and front office staff were outside smoking cigarettes as I left.  My brother-in-law previously came here with an injured foot and was told it was NOT broken. It was broken in four places and he was off work for four months.  The Nurse Practitioner today was fine, meant well, although he suggested that my children were faking to get out of school.  I assured him this was not the case.  I will NOT BE RETURNING.

I couldn't decide what to order so I ordered several items, and I have to say that all of them were fantastic. I had tacos, salad, pear flatbread, and other items, all of which were superb.  Staff was very friendly and accommodating.

Food is decent, service is hit or miss. It's been amazing at times and it's been less than stellar.  They are always friendly but just forgetful at times.  The food is inexpensive and they have a kids eat free night.

We called Mike and he indicated he would be able to arrive within 30 minutes which was great. When he showed up later in the day as we did not have an exact time of arrival, our office manager had stepped out to get lunch one minute down the street. According to my staff, he was verbally abusive and began demanding to know "how much his time was worth in comparison to hers." He then left and returned at which time I advised my staff has to pay him for the trip out there. Did not use his services and will not be using his services in the future. As a business owner I certainly understand the frustration and how important and valuable our time is, however becoming verbally aggressive and demanding is not professional nor appropriate.

The food is very, very good. However, be prepared to wait, and wait for quite a long time. I ordered two large pepperoni pizzas, a Stromboli, stuffed mushrooms and wings. With tax and delivery not including tip I spent $87. That being said, the food is definitely worth it. The pizza was thin, flavorful and delicious. The garlic rolls and accompanying sauce, (although a little watery) were absolutely fantastic. The stuffed mushrooms were very good and you can tell that they are using all fresh ingredients. The wings were good, I will ask for them to be crispy next time. As a small business owner myself, I know how difficult it is to run a well oiled machine. They've got the amazing food down, now just to speed up the process a bit. By the way I would've given five stars had it not been for the almost 2 hour wait.

I had friends over for the holiday weekend. Rather than drive after a long day, we ordered a large amount for pick-up.  The king crab and shrimp were a tad overcooked however the flavor made up for that. The corn and potatoes were perfectly cooked and again alive with flavor.  The alligator was good, would be better sautéed.  The frog legs were just so-so and again would be better sautéed. I don't think they were eaten.  The husband and kids loved the fish and chips as well as the chicken tenders kids meals.  The hush puppies were full of flavor and crisp. They were full of jalapeño flavor. Wow.  The shrimp were huge and the heads were intact. Fantastic.  Medium was hot enough that my chin burned an hour after eating. Perfect. Not too much. Mind you, I like spicy so tread carefully. Medium is HOT.  Our order was ready promptly and no mistakes made by staff.  The employee who took the order was friendly and accurately relayed the very long, detailed and intricate order with precision and a great attitude.  We will be back!
