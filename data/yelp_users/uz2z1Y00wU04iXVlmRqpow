We moved here from California and began searching for a pediatric office that would respect of views on raising our children. We asked several friends and this place kept coming up. We made an appointment and headed in. We saw Dr. McClend (I may have spelled that wrong). First the office was incredibly quick to get us in for a well check. Secondly the staff was super friendly. The nurse who too us back was very thorough, very nice. When we got to see the dr she was equally as friendly. She respected our views and never made us feel bad or lecture us about our choices. She addressed our concerns and spoke about a few she had. Our some was a premie, he only gained 8oz in a month so she insisted on formula supplements after nursing. She then have us a formula sample and coupons! Overall we were impressed! We will be bringing our other children to this office as well. The only thing we we're unsure of  is they have a sick and well entrance but they're just across from each other separated by a half wall and fish tank. But it's not a huge deal.

Besides being my husbands favorite place, this place is downright delicious! Great prices, great atmosphere, and great service. Even during a rush they manage to make diners feel like it's empty and you have their undivided attention. We look forward to date nights as it's our usual spot!

My husband and I decided to venture out and try this place for breakfast. It's small and quaint, like I could high five the person next to us cozy. Our server was super nice. We ordered food and before we knew it it was on our table. It was super good. It had a bed and breakfast feel to it. We were happy and will be back for sure.

I'm not sure where all these negative reviews are coming from but we had a date night here tonight and it was awesome!   We checked in to get tickets super quick and was able to pull them up on my phone.   Concession line wasn't long but the workers aren't the best at multitasking. That's to be expected thought with multiple orders. It wasn't designed for high traffic.  Reclining seats were awesome. More so picking exactly where we wanted to sit was cool. We were running a little behind and at a traditional theater that means break your neck up close seats.  Ticket prices for 3D and 2 adults were around $34. We don't see that many movies so I'm not sure if its comparable or not.  We will definitely be back!

Fast delivery and great food. BBQ pork fried rice was delicious. Chicken chow mien was a hit as well! I will be ordering again for sure!

We moved  here a few weeks ago from out of state. We love it here! The office staff are amazingly pleasant and not just during the move in process. The prices are great for what you're getting. Obviously there are things here and there that are not 100% satisfactory in terms of the unit itself. The stove is older, the fridge is on the smaller side, the washer and dryer don't match, if we're going to be nit picky. But the lake is beautiful, were so thankful we have a washer and drier in our apartment, we have 3 bedrooms all good size, the counter tops have been remodeled, our daughters school is 3 minutes away an overall and most important we feel safe. Not to mention we are centralized enough that we are close to pretty much anything we need! We're looking forward to this year!

This review is one from my husband. He went the other night for a beer. Said he walked in and there were only a couple people in there, so we decided to sit at the bar. He ordered his drink and began chatting with the bartender. Before he knew it he was having a discussion with the owner. He was impressed with how nice all the employees were and that they do happy hour all day. We're having a date night next week with our other family friends and this is where well be going! So excited to be so close to such a great place. Good job with the basics guys. Some places forget about the customer seevice!

I showed up with a swollen face! My right side was about the size of a golf ball. I called the office and said I think it's an absess, the lady on the phone was incredibly rude, asking if I was a oral professional. I said no I'm just assuming since I've had one before. So I made my appointment, and went in. I have dental insurance, I'm dual covered. The receptionist said she couldn't find anything and in irder to be seen I had to pay 29.99. I didn't feel like arguing so I just paid it. I have poor teeth this I know and I'm very very subconscious about it. The lady who took my X-rays was incredibly insensitive to my embarrassment, she made this clear when she said wow you need a lot of work done. The dentist came in and was kind, he just really pushed for extra services. He was in and out within 5 minutes. I would only go back in a pinch other than that I'll find somewhere else.

I was instructed to take my 7 week old son here when my pediatrician was unable to see him. My son had been throwing up and refusing to eat. I grabbed my id and insurance card, the baby and car keys and out the door I went.   When I arrived the receptionist was reading a book, didn't look up yet managed to mutter has he been seen before? I said no an was instructed to sign in and take a form (there was a slew of clipboards with new patient paperwork on the counter). We filled out the paper work and was told there was a copay. We don't have a copay... She insisted it was 20. After telling her I don't have my card she set her book down and very annoyed told me to take my son to the er than because they weren't going to see him.   I should he known that an urgent care in a strip wall was a bad idea. Next time I'll make sure to go to an actual urgent care where they care about my newborn.

They always do a great job on my nails. The first time I went in- I'm a nail biter- and asked to get a full set I was a little embarrassed when the male called over someone else and began starring at my hands and allying in a different language. He round aboutly was saying that they'll break and look bad. I said do it anyways.   I tried making small talk but he was rushing so fast that he wasn't having it..  Of course I went back and a time after that and he was so much nicer. I'm not sure if he was having a bad day or if my tattoos were off putting to him but it was night and day.   They do a good job and are pretty quick. For that reason I gave them a second chance. I'm glad I did. The prices are fair. Like any place you'll find there are charges for extras. My fills are $17! That's not bad at all.

I love this place- better yet my kids love this place. With my son having allergies it's nice to have a gluten free option. The oriental wrap is incredible! One of my favorites. It does get busy during lunch time but that's to be expected just about anywhere. I guess it just shows how well people like this place. But you can always call in ahead of time to cut down on the wait. With it being right off Elliot it makes it super easy to get in and zip right out.

First off, I'm going to address the customer service. It's incredible. Simply put. They remember my name, always smiling, and more so they make me feel welcome. I'm not good at small talk and they can engage a conversation in seconds flat. I can't believe there are reviews where people are upset they're getting an experience plus coffee. Society.   Secondly, the drinks. They make them incredibly quick and so far I've loved every drink I've ordered.   Lastly the wait. Yes, you do have to wait. You know like at a register at target... Only at Dutch they talk to you and it moves effortlessly. There's a line for a reason and it's not because they're messing around taking their time. They are fast moving and engaging.   Keep it up! I will continue to visit often!

I wanted to be so happy because they were so nice but they did such a terrible job! The next day my nails were chipping and the corners were so sharp I was scratching everything. The gel peeled off and I ended up spending $55 on nothing!! I just had my nails done today and it's been 3 days!!!!!!!! Never again will I be back

Here's a few tips and reason you'd actually come here...  1. You want lack luster frozen to deep fryer foods.   2. You want to be seated and then left alone.   3. You want to feel like you're single handedly ruining and interrupting the server/bar tenders social hour.   We had the worst service ever here. We went to celebrate my friends birthday and we saw our waitress twice. She didn't even bring us the check. We went to the bar to close out. It was also incredibly slow, strange for a Friday night.  We've been in there once before when the owners were there. Thankfully they don't care about their patrons, it'd be a shame if their pocketbooks weren't heavily lined. It's sad to see such disrespect from owners who forget why their in business in the first place. Almost makes me understand why their staff is so awful.

My husband and I drove by this place and finally decided to stop for lunch. I ordered the Alfredo pasta and he ordered the grilled cheese cheeseburger. Mine came out and was a huge portion with garlic bread. But it was terrible! To the point I couldn't even eat it. The chicken was clearly cooked then frozen, it was so rubbery it would have bounced if I threw it on the ground. Even my husband, who's like a garbage disposal said how terrible it was. His burger though was awesome. He offered to trade me but I was already our off so I didn't. It's one of those places we won't go back to unless were meeting someone who's already there, just wasn't impressed with it. Great atmosphere though and our server was ok. Just not worth the money spent

I LOVE this place!!!! There are so many options, combinations and the staff are the friendliest ever! The only con is how busy they get on Friday nights. But even then it makes me happy knowing kids chose this place over any other activities

Friday we took Madison to a trial. Her teacher was nice and Madison had a blast! The lady at the office was so helpful and made her feel so welcome. Of course we signed her up! We are looking forward to all that's to come.   The facility itself is immaculate. For as many children they had in there it was spotless.   There's an area to buy leotards, tshirts and such and a nice little snack area.   The class schedules are just the right amount of time. The cool thing is they aren't in the same spot for an extended period of time. It's always moving and they get a lot of variety.

I love this place. Is it pricey..yes. But is it worth every penny... YES! Our burgers were huge and cooked perfectly. The wings were crispy and flavorful. Our drinks were never empty and the staff was so welcoming. It's the top of our date night list every time.
