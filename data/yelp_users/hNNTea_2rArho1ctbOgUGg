So I take my dog in because he was getting his teeth taken care of and tell them he needs his backside expressed and to do the nails if necessary. They tell me if he needs pain meds they recommend those. Ok. When making the appointment I requested a specific Doctor and when I got there it wasn't the same Doctor.  So I get my dog back, nails are done and they didn't touch his backside, yet nobody will explain to me why he is scooting on the carpet. Ok. On to the pain meds, my dog is in absolutely no pain other than the fact that his breakfast is coming up down and out onto my carpet without warning. I want to note that everyone has been nothing but nice, particularly the male nurse, he is a really great employee from what I've observed.

I am a very loyal chase customer. I made an appointment, was ten minutes early, and then waited another ten minutes after only to be told it would be another five. This is awful customer service, if I make an appointment I expect to be taken to that appointment in a timely manner. If this branch was preparing for my appointment, being ten minutes early I should have been brought back to the banker far sooner than I was. An appointment is made so a customer can walk in and be helped promptly and this is not the case for this branch. I am a highly disappointed chase customer.
