Only good barber there is Yolanda..everyone else sucks..also I don't think anyone should have to spend 3 hours there on a slow day. And respect the order rule.when the barbers friends come in they don't wait. I was bumped 3 times today. That is BS. Definitely never going back

Was waiting there ten min and not even a hello from the employees..every customer was getting thier order and I'm there just waiting.i wouldn't of minded but it wasn't busy at all. At one point two employees just standing around just look at me and go back to doing nothing. Only good thing about this place is the location cause I just left and went to smash burger. Thanks Smash Burger!!

This is my favorite gym to go workout at.The lockers, shower and sauna are always clean. The staff is great and all the Taylor's at the front desk are very friendly and helpful :). I recently had issues with my account and Warren (the GM) was very quick to help and fixed my problem within the minute. Definitely recommend this gym :)
