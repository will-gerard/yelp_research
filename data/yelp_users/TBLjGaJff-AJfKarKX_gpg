This place is always the go to when you're feeling for some wraps. I always get the lamb, steak or chicken... Mostly chicken shawarma pita! Full of flavor and meat is hardly over or undercooked, it's perfectly juicy. We used to live around the area but we still drive out from 20 minutes away to get the gyros here because it's totally worth the drive!   We've also tried their home made pita bread, it is 50 cents or so more than the regular pita but it's really good. Definitely worth the try for a few cents more.

Love this place. I always get a pedi, mani, & wax here. For eyebrows, I usually ask for Katie & if you really want good cleaning in a pedi, ask for Anna. Someone I know usually prefers good cut and cleaning because she has pain with her nails and is close to getting ingrown on the big toe. She always requests for Anna. They're great here. For my eye brows I like them clean, not too thin, and more of a natural shape. Katie makes it super clean. Usually by eyebrows are sometimes hard to work with since the direction in which they go naturally is downwards.. Good quality in painting and worth the price. This is my favorite go to for especially for a pedicure. Not only, there's a starbucks right next to the salon! Gotta love this place. Check it out.

Studying for an exam & decided to go for a pedi here to relieve stress. I was looking for a cheap place and I was willing to check this place out. Usually I don't go for cheap places because of not just the quality but the actual pampering. I have been to nail places with cheap prices but cheap pamper, or not much pampering at all. HERE at Top Design Nails, the price is great, very fair & the pamper is worth more than its cost compared to other places I've been. I loved it & the ladies were nice. There are massage chairs & everything. They have lots of nail design options behind the door. The service and outcome was worth my pay. With the experience I had from this place, I would definitely come back. I got white tips on my toes btw. The white tips on my toes were not too thick just as I liked it, and if they weren't looking how you wanted I would just tell them to make it thinner or thicker or to however you'd want it. Anyway, I'd recommend this place if you're in the area! :)

Food quality is great, tasty, and always leaves me full! I can always count on it being tasty consistently. The sauces they give are great and not watery. I go to other Hawaiin BBQ eating spots and their sauces aren't always great and their food. I could always count on Leo's to hit the spot! I'm a regular since grand opening and I hope to see this place grow. Love it!

I've never written a bad review or get lengthy as I always usually use yelp mainly to check in, explore, post pictures and add tips. I only say this because it's happen to me & my family 3 times already.  As they are now open 24 hours, we came late last night at around 11. Even though it's late, the time didn't matter because it's happened already before during mid-day, & even when the place isn't crowded. It always happens or maybe I'm just exaggerating because I've seen it happen to others as well but here's the problem: they give smoothies we've ordered to another customer who actually ordered not right after us but a good five to ten minutes after us. This is quite irritable because, yes I understand everyone wants their smoothies, but that includes me and I'm sure anyone wouldn't like this to happen to them constantly. It's not just that, the time is lengthy for a "fast" service as everyone had said. Expect to wait for 10-15 minutes for a smoothie or two. If it happens once, it's okay. Twice, I give grace. But three times? They need a follow up with the way they manage things. It happened that last night, the other customer decided to raise his hand claiming that the smoothies coming out were theirs without the worker not asking who they are or making sure it's theirs. As soon as he brought out a pair of smoothies, they quickly assumed it's theirs. They take our names after placing the order, but I noticed they are never consistent with actually calling it which I assume is the intention of asking for the name of the person who makes the order in the first place. In fact, I'm even more disappointed that they don't seem to make sure ever that they are giving orders to the right people/party. Well, as the customers who got our order started drinking it, not even long but 2 minutes after, the same worker comes out calling out that customers name. I had been watching this happen of course, and from the beginning that he got drinks before us even though we ordered far long before him, I felt I am in no place to go to their table and to have to voice my belief that those are supposed to be mines. I did not choose to stare as I had already looked at them and felt that they realized it was our drinks when his actually drinks came out. I overheard them saying "I feel bad for whosever drinks those were". Not sure if they ordered the same drinks or what but the worker went back to the kitchen. They other customers left right after, probably in guilt, embarrassment or awkwardness because everyone that was there may have heard or that it was ours. Not sure which drinks, whether it was his (if he ordered the same we did) or if it were mines that he already drank that might have went back to the kitchen but it came out a minute after the worker went back in. As I finally received it, it was given to us quickly and the worker had not said anything but just politely as he could, he placed the smoothies we ordered in front of us. I took it, and left home because I felt our wait was long past my expectation. We were given the correct drinks and it felt that that was all that mattered at the moment. I did not feel in the beginning that I needed a receipt, so I didn't have that but I realized when I put in my straw when I was on the way home, the drink was quite melted and the amount that was given may have seemed like it was actually the ones the other people had had (someone already drank some of it). This is what I believe, and I wish I had watched everything to see if they which smoothies, the ones they drank or the second ones that were brought to him. It honestly just seemed like within the minute after he went back to the kitchen, he may have switched to new caps? They always take long, so I assumed I really did get the guys' order (the second ones that came out) or we got ours which they already drank. It's either or but I would probably not be surprised if I was correct. If we got the new ones, I feel he would have not needed to go back to the kitchen.  But because our orders have been given to other customers the past 3 times, this is not any customer's fault even if they believe it's their food/drinks that are coming out but it is the responsibility of the team at TSC. I really hope the management changes & I don't believe that this should make anyone that it's happened to or that it might happen to, to feel unlucky.   They need to simply fix this by making sure they know who they are giving it to, use the names they ask when it's ordered and call it when the order is ready and make sure it's really whose it is. THIS NEEDS TO FIXED. I've been here since a few years ago and hate to start disliking it and I would hate to have to give honest recommendation to  others to not come to this location.

My first time going here to see what all the hype is about on the House Special. I went with a few friends and my boyfriend. This was my first and only visit so far and I just tried their House Special. You can sit in the store or outside. It's not that big and I could compare it similar size to a Yogurtland. As everyone told me, the wait sometimes is too long and to my experience, I say it true. It took about 5-7 minutes and I was fine with that because I am a pretty reasonable and patient person. There was only 1 person working... Back to the drink, I enjoyed it very much. The House Special drink is very good & definitely worth a try. I am filipino and the way I could describe this drink is that it is like a cold taho. I gulped it down because it was too good!! I still need to try more drinks but I have a strong feeling that I will just come back for the House Special.

The way you order is similar to Chipotle but the taste is not similar to chipotle. This place is just so good. I recommend a try. I always go for the fire grilled chicken salad with black beans and no rice with everything else on it. I love that this meal is cilantro and lime flavored. Their cilantro ranch is basically what makes the flavor. I order it this way because the entree is quite a lot. I would always share with my boyfriend because of how much it is and how full I'd get. Place is so worth a try. There's other options of meat and different ways you can have your food prepared.
