MB Motors is a family run establishment that only services Mercedes-Benz automobiles and if you have a Mercedes-Benz, this is the place to take your car for service.  I was referred here by someone a couple years ago and every experience I've had with MB Motors has been outstanding.  They will take the time to tell you, and show you, what needs repaired; they will complete the repair quickly; and their pricing can't be beat.  In fact, I often feel like I should be paying them more than they charge, given the amount of time they often spend with me and my car.  They won't sell you a service you don't need, and they take the time needed to correctly identify a problem.  Take your car here - you won't be disappointed.

I love Sun Up.  If I had my druthers, I would eat here every week.  I think they have excellent beer.  All of their cask conditioned ales are awesome.  The food is above average bar food and everything seems to have a little zip (spice) to it, which I like.  My favorite item by far is the wings.  I have always found the staff to be friendly.  The environment is relaxing and quiet enough to easily carry a conversation.    If you like good beer, try Sun Up - you won't be disappointed.

Avoid the service department here at all costs, unless you like to be spoken to in a condescending manner and overcharged.  Long story short, I bought my JSW TDI new here.  Shortly thereafter, I ran out of gas and had to have the car towed to the dealership.  They basically made fun of me and charged me a couple hundred dollars to get on the road again.  I ran out of gas almost immediately after the fuel light turned on.  After the generally demeaning tone from the service department during this experience, I began taking my VW to VW North Scottsdale.    Some time later, I ran out of gas again, had it towed to VW North Scottsdale where they got me on the road again at no charge.  I continued to have issues with fueling, mainly that I could never get the tank completely full and when the reserve fuel light came on I had to beat a path to the gas station.  It turns out that the fuel tank on my car was defective and as the gas was used, the plastic tank was collapsing in on itself.  VW North Scottsdale, who always listened to my concerns and never talked to me like I was a retarded moron, warrantied the tank (even though I was past 36,000 miles because I had been complaining about this problem since the car was almost new) and put in a new fuel tank at no charge.  I contacted Camelback VW and Volkswagen North America about the exceptionally poor service at Camelback VW, and was basically told to go fly a kite.  Unbelievable.  I guess Camelback VW figured they had already lost my business so why do the right thing.  What a bunch of, well, use your favorite word.    If you need your VW serviced, and you live in Maricopa County, and you prefer exceptionally GOOD service, head to VW North Scottsdale.  I still drive down their from Prescott.  AVOID Camelback VW entirely, unless you like dealing with nasty people and spending money when you don't have to.

Einsteins in general has mediocre bagels at best, and their "schmears" appear to be highly processed.  I've generally given up on Einsteins all together because because their food has really taken a nose dive, as has the service.  I stopped by this location recently because I was driving by and in a hurry, and wanted a bagel (they're supposed be a bagel store after all!).  First, no salt bagels.  Aren't salt bagels one of the standards?  Second, I ordered my bagel with cream cheese (cream cheese being a $1.50 option) to go and that was my real mistake.  Whoever made the bagel didn't even manage to slice all the way through the bagel and put an amount of cream cheese approximately equivalent to a pat of butter on one-half of the bagel.  The other half was basically dry.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, I was pretty annoyed when I got to work and opened up my bagel.  Stick to any of the local bagel joints like Chompies or Kashmans - they have much better bagels, and they will dump a brick of cream cheese on them for you.

I had lunch here with a friend recently.  He ordered a pastrami sandwich, and I had a grilled cheese sandwich.  We each had a fountain drink, and we got a container of hamantashen.  Our total bill was over $30, which I thought was excessive for what we got.  The food was okay, but I've definitely had better.

We use RedSeven for our business and could not ask for more.  We have purchased several computers from them (great pricing) and Nick often comes to our office to quickly solve our technological problems.  They are very knowledgeable, reasonably priced, and provide quick, competent and personal service.

This location was my first experience with the Two Hippies restaurants, and it makes me want to try all of the other Two Hippies establishments.  I can walk there from work and I eat there all the time.  It's not fancy, but the food is really inexpensive and I find it very tasty.  The hot dogs ($3.50-$4) are particularly good - they come on large hoagie buns and are covered with generous amounts of toppings.  My favorite is the #9 hot dog with onions, peppers, tomatoes, cheese and guacamole.  Burgers ($6) are good too - juicy with flavorful toppings.  And, the staff are super friendly which makes a trip there all the more pleasant.

I have only been here for happy hour, but their happy hours is very good.  They have draft beer and there are a variety of appetizers on the happy hour menu for cheap that are all very tasty.  It is a comfortable place to eat - open, high ceilings, nice decor - and the staff has always been very friendly.

I live nearby and figured I should give this place a shot.  I recently went to Zen Zen Yogurt near 44th St. and Indian School and enjoyed it and I figured Zoyo would be similar.  It was not.  We tried 5 different flavors, and they were all memorable in a bad way.  The vanilla was the least offensive, and the strawberry cheesecake and pistachio were the worst.  The topping selection was somewhat limited unless you like things you normally would not want to eat with yogurt like gummy bears.  The decor was contemporary and the place was clean.

I really liked this place.  My wife and I tried it based on the other positive reviews on Yelp, and we were not disappointed.  I had the paradise bacon CHZ burger with cheddar cheese and jalapeno ranch dressing.  The burger came with lettuce, tomato, some variety of onion that was unusual and cucumber too.  The bun was thin, light and toasted - I found it to be a much better bun than your typical dense, soggy burger bun.  The burger consisted of two very thin patties and had a nice grilled taste.  I've eaten a lot of burgers in the valley, and this was a very tasty burger.    My wife got the paradise CHZ burger and subbed in a portobello mushroom for the burger.  She said this is her favorite burger place in the valley and she wants to go back.  I take that as a serious endorsement from someone who generally does not like burgers.    We also each ordered the sweet potato tater tots and those were good too.  For drinks, we both opted for glasses of water, and they offered water with cucumber which was very satisfying, and much better than the typical nasty tap water you find most places.  The staff was super friendly and it was quiet inside so we could carry on a conversation easily.  Our total tab was just under $20.  We will definitely go back and I'm going to try one of their milkshakes next time.    Unpretentious, great food, great value for money, relaxing environment and friendly staff.  Check it out!
