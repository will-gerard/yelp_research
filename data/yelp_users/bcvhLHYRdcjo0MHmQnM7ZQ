BEST SALON EVER. I've been to a lot of places around the Valley and none have ever compared to Salon Estique. I'm super picky, and pretty knowledgable about color and cuts since I've experimented a lot with my hair. I've gotten a cut and partial weave here numerous times with great results.   What's more - the front desk girls are VERY helpful and sweet. Actually, the whole staff pretty much treats customers like they are royalty. They are all really nice and unpretentious - which is a nice change of pace. The salon is on a teamwork system, so they help each other out to make sure they are not holding you up or running late. Also- they seem to have a lot of availability and are easier to get in to than most places I've gone to.  I highly recommend this place. I've never had a nicer experience. Whatever the owners are doing - it's working.

Awful service! Mediocre food... if it was what I ordered. The beer was OK but nothing great compared to other breweries around town. I really wanted to like this place, sadly disappointed. No one helped us when we walked in (they weren't busy) and our server kept forgetting about us to chat with dudes at the bar. When she messed up on our food she wasn't very graceful about it... and we still had to pay full price. It also took almost two hours, and we didn't make it to the plans we had afterward. It wasn't just our servers that was bad, the bartender was rude and so was another server. Won't go back... the owners really need to step in!

Awful.  The selection still consists mostly of t-shirts from the 90s and out of style clothing. Yet, when I bring in my VERY RECENTLY purchased designer clothes to sell to them--- they take nothing. Hmmm... someone needs to take a second look at how they manage their inventory.  Today I went there for the last time. I brought a never-worn Banana Republic cashmere sweater, T-bags dress, JCrew dress, and new CHLOE dress (among other very good, wintery items) that the girl at the counter didn't take. She was about 18 and obviously wasn't trained to recognize good merchandise!! That's just lost money for them... considering they mark up what they buy from you by about FOUR TIMES as much as what they gave you for it.  I suggest My Sister's Closet.

DIRTY CAR EVEN AFTER MOST EXPENSIVE CARWASH.   This has happened to me three times there now. Each time, I get a car wash/oil change with the most expensive wash. Each time they leave my cup-holders, parts of windshield, and inside of doors/dash DIRTY... even though I reminded them that I would like them cleaned. This last time, it really looked like they just vacuumed my car. Also, they are really too expensive for what you get. They also get mad/rude if you don't upgrade to all the things they offer you. The sales guy at the beginning got grouchy with me and literally stopped talking to me as soon as I said, "No thank you" to a filter change.

I have to say, I DO like their food and the service is always pretty good. The atmosphere is great. HOWEVER, making reservations there is a different story.   They only take reservations for 10 or more. I had 7...  My grandparents are in town, and can't really "wait at the bar" until a table is ready. They are old and tired. Hence, I tried to make reservations here, called 24 hours in advance... they told mebthey couldnt do it, but  to come in anyway and 'wait at the bar' for a table. I told them I was going to be with some older people, and asked if there was anyway we could just call in 20 minutes beforehand and put our name on the list, so my grandparents wouldnt have to stand at the bar. They said they didnt do that. Seeing as it THE EXACT SAME THING as coming in to put my name on the list and wait twenty minutes there, I dont see the problem. I asked them politely if they could make an exception considering the situation... they said absolutely not. Where I come from, restaurants will try everything they are capable of to accommodate their guests. This IS NOT what Postino's or the LGO owners do at any of their restaurants. After talking to Postino's, I tried Chelsea's and LGO and got the same answer.  I also tried Chelsea's, which takes reservations for less then 10 but got the same story, they were booked and we could wait. Also asked them about calling in when we were on our way b/c I was with two older people who could not stand long... they said no way.  I own two restaurants, I can tell you-- this is not appropriate customer service. Its also not very moralistic. If a frequent customer explains a situation, seeking a little help, and its not ridiculous, the restaurant shoud be happy to do it.   Seems as if the LGO owners have taken a cue from Houston's... which is the type of place that gives Scottsdale a bad reputation. The type of service that scares out-of-towners away from Arizona because we are too "snooty."

I have been going to this dermatologist's office for years. However, as long as I've gone there, I haven't ever been completely happy with the experience. It just seemed easier not to deal with the hassle of dealing with switching, until today.   I called and asked the woman at the front desk if there were any available appointments in the next couple days. She made the hugest sigh I have ever heard and said, "Well, uh, um, we don't even have any physicians in the office until I don't know when." She said this is a really rude manner like I was bothering her. Then I asked, "Well, I normally just see one of the physician's assitants, can I get in with them?"  She says , "(scoffs again) No. No one is in the office. What is it exactly that you need?"  I said, "I just need an appointment! I need a prescription refilled and somone to look at my skin!" She then RUDELY told me that nothing was available until the end of August. I just said thanks anyway and she hung up. She really made me feel like I was out of line for asking for an appointment at all!  This is only one of my rude encounters with the ladys at the front desk at this place. One time I got yelled at for quietly talking on my phone in the waiting room. Also, I got two moles removed here by physician's assitants, only to later find out later by the doctor that it should never have been allowed. PS~ The moles ended up taking WAY longer than normal to heal, and have awful scars that are way worse than the moles were themselves.   DON'T GO HERE!

Awkward set up that is messy and unorganized. It's one of those places where you are not sure what to do or where to stand or where to get your food and coffee - and they don't care. They are trying so hard to be hipster and cool that they forgot about customer service. They just need to re-think they way they operate, and I think they would rock, since the coffee is very good. The food is just average, however. My biggest complaint is that there is one dark haired short girl that works there that just seems out of it and rude. She does't look at you when you order, and then end up making you repeat yourself several times. Also - she's not very polite. Maybe I just wasn't hipster enough for her.   I think most people go here b/c of the hype and to scope out others... If you don't feel like getting looked up and down while you drink your coffee, don't go here. Lola or Urban Beans are much better.

I used to love this place until this past year. The service and operations has gone downhill. They are always out of nearly all their ingredients for their breakfast menu and recently, they could not make COFFEE because their machines were down. Yes, this can happen, but usually a business scrabbles to get things like this fixed. At Tammie Coe, they don't give a crap. It almost seems as if the owners have neglected the Downtown Phoenix location over the past year or so. The desserts are still good, but the service and the employees are awful. It;s really frustrating to go there and not know what you are going to get -  sometimes it's a 30 min wait for iced coffee (not b/c they are busy), employees that can't seem to get your order right, or a large list of menu items that they are out of. They also stopped doing breakfast on the weekends - which makes no sense. I might be b/c they only had one cook, and when he was gone they would just close the kitchen randomly without any sign on the door or anything not the website.   I'm really bummed, I used to love their food, but after COUNTLESS chances resulting in disappointment this past year, I am done. I think it really sucks that they don't care to keep things stocked and operational for their Downtown patrons.

Slowwwww service. From waiting 30 minutes to be seated (with open tables) to waiting 20 minutes before being able to order and 40 minutes for our food.

Very experienced owners who definitely know what they are doing! The best part bout this place: They seriously give a crap about their customers, unlike a lot of local chains. They will always do their best to accommodate you - whether it be for food allergies/intolerances/special diets, or reservations. The menu offers a ton of variety. A little secret: The owner loves good quality beef, hence, the burger and the carne/steak are AWESOME. Something good for folks who may not be int he mood for traditional mexican food, but are going with a group.

It is hard to find a place that delivers late Downtown. Z Pizza saved my life! I was really sick at home and needed to eat but could not leave my bed. I didn't want just pizza. I noticed Z Pizza had salads, sandwiches, etc. I was able to order online.... adding/removing any ingredients I wanted. They delivered within 30 minutes and the food did NOT taste like take-out. My calzone was fresh and amazing...as was my salad.   I highly recommend dining in or taking out from Z Pizza! They make life easy, and might I add, HEALTHY if you'd like. You can substitute veggie burger crumbles or wheat crust on pretty much anything. Last but not least: the staff was incredibly friendly.

The best Thai food I have had in Phoenix. We read all the bad reviews on here before I went- but was desperate for Thai food later in the evening so we still decided to go.   We were pleasantly surprised! It is better than Thai Elephant and Thai Basil. Definitely more authentic and more flavorful. We are picky and eat out frequently- so it's saying a lot that we loved this place.  We tried the hot and sour soup with beef, the silver noodle soup, and the drunken noodles. The drunken noodles were literally the best either of us had ever had. My soup was probably one of the best I've had (hot and sour) with WAY more flavor than most places. My boyfriend said his silver noodle soup reminded him of an authentic dish his filipino mother used to make.   Also, the staff was super friendly in that we-are-all-family-and-we-welcome-you-with-open-arms kind of way. The lady at the front was also hilarious. She and our waiter checked on us several times and were very good about explaining the dishes.   Last- the Thai iced was great and the place was beautiful.  Yes- the tables are rather large and a bit awkward, but it was no big deal.   Also, the food did take awhile but this is a small shop with authentic recipes that were well worth the wait.   We will be back!

DON'T use this company. I shouldve listened to the reviews I read. Worst experience. Think he might use other people parts he keeps from repairs. Never provided receipt we asked for or warranty for new parts and didn't give us our old parts back. After it took him a week to fix our AC, it's broken again.

Absolutely love this place! Amazing food... heard the chef has quite a cult following.... and we could taste why.   Great place for lunch in North Scottsdale.   The owner actually gave us a little rock history behind some of the collector's rock artwork hanging on the walls. The decor was very funky yet intimate and the menu was the most creative I've seen in a long time. Excellent music on the whole time. A nice change of pace from your typical stuffy winebar.  Actually carried a lot of light-bodied reds which can be hard to find by the glass at restaurants. I feel like at this place... you don't have to choose between good food and good wine. It has both.

Absolutely LOVED this place. Great food (gotta try the French Onion Soup Dumplings), great service, great atmosphere. There are rare rock n roll pieces of art and photography hanging on the walls... and they're for sale. The owner, Terry, knows the historical story behind each photograph of favorites like Grace Slick, Clapton, Hendrix, Lennon, etc. Also, there is excellent music on the whole time and the patio is MASSIVE. They have music there on the weekends... I saw a talented local band called Tramps and Thieves. The food is high-scale but the prices don't reflect it. Both unique culinary pairings and classic items. There are also cool little decorations everywhere. Definitely going back.

We had the best experience with Moving Team Six. They were cheaper than Two Men and a Truck and most of the other main companies, and they didn't nickel and dime us with charges depending on the size/weight/number of boxes, etc. We just told them we had a three story place with two bedrooms and gave them a ballpark of boxes and big items, and they gave us a rate right away. All the other guys wanted up to 48 hours to get back to us, after asking for a complete inventory of our stuff - with measurements, etc.   They showed up right on time, moved very quickly, and were also VERY careful with our stuff. They knew exactly how to wrap the items to protect them. They were also very friendly and moved everything exactly where we needed it. I never plan on using any other moving company!

Love it! Great atmosphere and drink selection. Also, the menu looked amazing but we did not eat. What surprised me the most was how cheap the drinks were!!! Very reasonable. Also, the building is really cool and the atmosphere is really cool... it does not feel like the rest of Downtown Phoenix.

I rarely leave negative reviews.. but this is consistently the worst service out of any Starbucks I've been to - EVER. Unfortunately I go here because it is close to my house and I love starbucks iced coffee... But almost ALL the employees are always completely out of it, slow, not eager to help, and constantly make mistakes because thy aren't listening/don't care. It's so weird - I actually really think Starbucks manager and corporate staff would not be happy. Normally I love starbucks but this is more like an overstaffed-yet-super-slow store pretending to be starbucks. It's not fast or efficient like the brand is known for. It's like everyone hired here are high school dropouts with no desire to do anything. It's bad service EVERYTIME and the drive thru line is always really slow because the chick they always have it makes so many mistakes. Also- they never have the creamer out on the weekend mornings and it's like pulling teeth trying to get their attention to ask for it. All I get is a black iced coffee, and it ALWAYS takes at LEAST 10 minutes.... on the weekends after 10am. Not their busiest time. The line is just long because all the workers are alway so confused.

Been here twice and had horrible service each time. First time, we waited 45 minutes before a server came to our table to get our drink order. We had to get up and flag someone down. Then of course after that, we had multiple servers coming up asking if we had been helped yet... I think it's because they pool tips and don't have table sections... They all are either redundant or no where to be found.  Second time I went it was one of the strangest experiences I've ever had... Ever.  We were asked THREE times by multiple servers if we had a safe way to get home,but instead of them asking it that way, they gave us long dance-around-the-issue schpeels about the community and how they want to keep it safe. We told em we were light railing home and lived down the street.... they were obviously worried about us drinking and driving. Even after that, thy still failed to being us our last round... Without actually telling us they were cutting us off. We each had three drinks and dinner and had been there for three hours. Then we had to get up and ask for the bill TWICE because no one ever came back to our table after three of them had bomboarded us with questions at separate times.

Great food! Also I wanted to leave this review because today, in spite of their CRAZY busy lunch rush, one of their managers went above and beyond to go get creamer for me at the grocery store when they ran out. Totally not necessary but he insisted. Also, I am in the restaurant industry and watched him expedite the line to get food orders up and out like no other! A true professional who has clearly had great training from Fox and enjoys what he does. Didn't go unnoticed. I hope Flower Child/Fox Concepts realizes what a great manager they have there!
