As Heather mentioned below, I had to be coaxed into believing there was life after Dr. Heather. However, I recently developed an allergy to my contact lens solution. Dr. Mastores diagnosed me accurately and then prescribed a course of treatment (corticosteroid drops, lubricant drops, patadine drops, and daily contact lenses) that had my eyes feeling better in short order. She is very personable and seems to know her stuff.

I was traveling to San Francisco on business and left my toiletry bag at home, daily contact lenses included. I called Central Phoenix Eye Care as soon as I landed, and Kimberly consulted Dr. Mastores and confirmed that the lenses I had in would not last me for the duration of my 3-day stay.   I expected to be given my prescription and then find a optometrist in the city on my own, but Kimberly asked me for the address where I was staying, then called around and found an optometrist nearby willing to give me a sample pack at no charge. Many thanks to her for going out of her way to make sure I was taken care of in a stressful situation. This place has an amazing staff!

4-stars for the food and wine. The ambiance is nice, but as with most Upward Projects ventures, I feel like they're trying too hard. Let the food speak for itself. All the trendy decor is just a magnet for hipster douches. Nothing ruins my bruschetta and merlot like some horn-rimmed square talking loudly about his latest inde rock band 'find' or his 'sweet pieces of vinyl' at the proximal table. Dude...SHUT UP!

Pretty damn good. Haven't gotten around to trying their calzones yet, but their pizza has a good thin but chewy crust. Wings aren't going to blow your skirt up (I was wearing a skirt when I tried them, so I would know) but they won't blow your skirt down either (this, again, is based on my own research).  The other thing that I love, having spent some time on the east coast, is just how Jersey these guys are. They're surly as hell, yet somehow endearing. Embrace it.

I had a hungry family of 12 visiting from out of town and decided to try this place based on their Yep (Yelp Rep). They delivered big time. The pizzas arrived at my door on time and hot. We ordered 'da greek' and it got rave reviews from everybody. I will definitely order from them again!

The food was passable. The dining room was nearly empty at 7 pm on a weeknight. Not that I crave a crowded and noisy dining experience, but it would've been nice to think we'd made the right choice eating there by seeing other diners voting with their wallets.  I don't think our waitress spoke any English beyond what was on the menu. She had to go get help from another waitress when I ordered a whiskey on the rocks. Even the more fluent of the two didn't think to ask me what kind of whiskey, so I was served rail that tasted like the ice cubes had come from a moldy dispenser.  The food was ok. Nothing special. I had the kung pao chicken. It lacked spice and came loaded with onions (which I had asked them to leave out).

I goddamn love sky harbor. Serious, were it possible to have intercourse with an airport, I would be humping the Barry Goldwater Terminal like a rabbit on adderall. I've never waited in line for more than 10 minutes...FOR ANYTHING! And I've flown in and out of here at least 30 times.   TSA folks are chipper at their best and nonchalant at their worst. Can't ask for much  more than that. The food choices aren't as good as some other places (Denver or Salt Lake City, for example) but oh well. I'm here to fly, not buy.

Brought my nephews here and it seemed to be good for about 2 hours-worth of diversion for a couple of rambunctious 4 year olds. My biggest grip is their ticketing system. It is kind of a pain to have to buy tickets to all the different parts of the complex...just a personal preference, but I would prefer to just pay a flat rate (like $10) at the door and be done with it.  The Pullman Car exhibit was really cool, so definitely spring the $2 for that if you go.

Very nice indoor gun range. Good selection in the store and they do a good job of being fair about ammo sales during the present paucity of brass.  I also took their 8 hour CCW class and I highly recommend. Tim Forshey is a local lawyer and teaches the afternoon portion of the class dealing with applicable laws. He is very knowledgeable and won't bullshit you or sugar coat anything (he even painted a couple of mental pictures of assailants and assailees shitting themselves during armed encounters). Great place to take a CCW class.  Sometimes they seem a little understaffed, but I've never waited more than 5 minutes for range check in.

The food is great, but Genesis (pronounced heh-neh-sis for you gringos) puts the food to shame. Tonight she is wearing sassy red lipstick that is TO DIE FOR OMG. Best bartender ever. Ask her for a tres amigos y gordo next time you're in. She won't make it for you, but she'll most likely flash you that bajillion watt smile of hers-a worthy consolation prize indeed.

I cannot rave enough about Four Peaks, just not this location. The beer is great, the food is great, but the service is not as good as at the original spot in Tempe.   That being said, the Scottsdale location is also much easier to get in to on a given night. Contrast with the Tempe location, where I've waited 1.5 hours for a table on a Tuesday night. True, it is worth the wait, but after that long swilling Oatmeal Stout one can barely even taste their food. And that is saying something, as the food here inspires ebullience.   5 stars for the food and drink, 4 stars for the service, and I round down (because I'm a bastard).

Very happy with this place. Came in for an initial visit with my Pit and made it out spending under $100 for vaccines and a checkup! The staff was friendly and very gentle with my dog. There was no pressure tactics or up selling going on, and they even informed me that a prescription my dog is on is actually available over the counter. I think we've found our vet!

This could've easily been a 1-star review were it not for the customer service provided by this place.   I came to meet a friend on a Monday night. He was looking to blow off steam due to some lady friend problems, and I'd had a stressful day at work. Add to that that my phone died as I walked in the door and my friend was running late, and you have a semi-grouchy yelper on the premises.  I grabbed a spot at the bar to wait for my friend. Like I said, phone was dead, so I had no idea how long I'd be waiting. Once my friend arrived, we both ordered the chicken strips (juvenile, I know). One of my friend's strips was raw on the inside. The bar tender not only comped my friend's plate, but mine as well (even though mine were thoroughly cooked). After sending the defective strips back to the kitchen, he returned with a plate heaping with perfectly cooked chicken tenders. Props to this place for knowing how to rectify a mistake.  Oh, and the bowling was fun too.

One night a very short fellow kicked a very dear friend of mine in the genitals because he asked the vertically challenged dude and his friends if they were all going to go home after the bar and 69 each other. This was after a friend of the short dude was caught trying to steal valuables from our jackets. In short, this place is awesome and I am shocked...SHOCKED...to not see more 5-star reviews.

If you're concerned about your weight, stay the hell away from here. Unless you're concerned about being underweight, in which case saddle up. I had the calzone and it probably came in at just shy of 3 pounds. I carved about a 1 inch strip off the side and saved it for the next day, Sunday, when I would inevitably be hungover and in need of 287 grams of fat in one sitting. What can I say? It was a glorious Sunday.

I vacillated between 1 and 2 stars for Pete's. In the end I decided on 2, but that is probably only because I was so hungry from a morning of construction work that I would've eaten nearly anything. When I think of real Fish and Chips, I think of what I had in London. This isn't what I had in London. This is what I ate in college during lent--store bought cheap fish patties. The shrimp weren't good either; tasted extremely fishy. The fries were soggy and bland.  I realize this is a fast food place, but I was hoping for something more than that. I'd honestly rather eat at Long John McGreaseball's.

I wish I could give this place a better rating...mostly because of the statue of Willie Nelson sitting on the bar smoking a J. Alas, Harold's, it was not to be.  I've been here a few times with a smaller crowd, but this past Saturday I brought family of 12 visiting from out of town on the way to a day at Bartlett Lake. Nearly everything that could go wrong did.   For starters, it turned out that they were having a Kentucky Derby viewing party that day. At the door, a startled hostess first told they couldn't accommodate a group my size with out a reservation, but they eventually found a place for us in the dining room.   Apparently, outside of their Derby party, everything else was an afterthought. Service wasn't unbearably slow, but we would've liked to see our waitress more often. We would have also liked her to listen more closely, because: I ordered fried chicken-I got chicken fried steak, 1 burger missing cheese, all burgers not cooked to doneness requested, several orders of sweet potato fries missing (even though we were still charged for the upgrade), several of us ordered the BBQ platter, only to be told 10 minutes later that it was too early in the day and they didn't have any cooked yet, we were charged 18% gratuity even on the items that were then removed from the bill (like the chicken fried steak).   The runner that brought my food out also rolled his eyes at me when I informed him that I had not ordered the chicken fried steak. Great service, dude.   Will I ever go here again? Maybe if it's just me and 1-2 friends and we're ordering steaks at the bar. More than likely, though, I'll be heading next door to the buffalo chip.

My family had a disastrous experience at Harold's across the parking lot earlier in the day at lunch. Coming back from Bartlett Lake, we were all pretty famished and wanted some good barbecue. I would say the Buffalo Chip delivered admirably. Service was fast and efficient, and they also had a rock crawling contest through the local Jeep club happening out back. This provided some fun entertainment while we waited for our food.  I would categorize their baby back ribs as good but not great. Some pieces were very tender, others were a little tough. The beans were unremarkable. I washed it all down with a very large mug of PBR at a very attractive price of $3.  The band was just setting up as we were leaving. I would've loved to stay and listen to the haggard old fella that was tuning his pedal steel guitar, but we had to get home and put the little dudes to bed. I'll make sure to come back sometime on a Saturday night to make a total ass of myself on the dance floor.  The biggest negative: This place counts itself as a Packers bar. Gross.

DJ's is bar far my favorite bar in OtoSco (that's short hand for Old Town Scottsdale, squares). It's not pretentious, it's not packed, and the music doesn't drown out conversation.   1 star docked because parking in OtoSco effing sucks (not their fault) and also because there is still a stray douche bag or two that wanders in from time to time (can't you guys start macing them?).

I know it isn't trendy to like chain restaurants, but I have to say Pei Wei almost always delivers. I love the convenience of ordering online for in-store pickup (like most millenials, I would rather shoot myself in the testicles than pick up the phone and talk to a real person). There is great variety and originality in the menu, and they really let you customize the heck out of your meal. Go eat here. Now.

I love this store. Great place to pick up the bare essentials and not break your bank or your belt in the process. Always a great and reasonably priced selection of wine and beer (but stay away from the TJ's cheap-o brand beer). That being said, I wish they had a good selection of liquors from lesser-known distilleries. Oh well.  Oh yeah, and as I mentioned in my tip, there are always a few gorgeous women shopping every time I go in. What? I'm only human...

I've been kicked out of here twice but I keep coming back. I'd say that is a pretty good endorsement. Their fries are phenominal. The rest is pretty much standard bar fare, but with the dearth of nightlife options in this part of the valley, you won't hear me complaining. Service can be hit or miss depending on which bartender/waitress you get.

Expensive for my liking between cover charge and the price of drinks. I'd say it is worth it though for the awesome live music and country girls running all over the place.   I'm docking one star: In the bar's namesake song, Mr. Keith utters the line, "No cover charge." That, sir, is bullshit!

The food? Ok. The drink selection? Ok. But the service at this place, and specifically, that delivered by Tracey the bartender, garner a coveted 5-star rating from this yelper. The bar was busy enough to warrant 2 bartenders, but she really had everything covered. She even had the presence of mind to ask if I wanted her to put another drink order in for me before happy hour ended. Most people are immediately able to sense what a drunk I am, but unlike Tracey, few are willing and able to coddle my addiction so proactively. Great job Tracey, and great job Clancy's!

It was a Sunday afternoon at about 10:30 AM (as I call it, the breakfasting hour...er...half hour). I had 12...TWELVE...hungry family members visiting  me from out of town. Half wanted to cook breakfast at my house. The rest were ambivalent. After whiffing on lunch the previous day (see my scathing review of Harold's Corral), I needed a place to come through.   Enter U.S. Egg.   I'd long been a fan of their Tempe location, but service can vary greatly from one branch to the next. I called and got the owner. He said it was his busiest time of day but once we arrived he could seat us in approximately 10 minutes. He kept his word.   The service was fast and efficient, if not overly friendly (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). My Texan omelette was hearty and satisfying. The rest of my family raved about the protein pancakes, and they were very accommodating to my gluten-free sister. All 12 of us left in a wonderful food coma.   Having failed spectacularly the previous day to find a decent brunch spot, I needed to find a place to deliver me from the harsh judgement of my siblings regarding my ability to pick local restaurants. U.S. Egg saved my ass. Bravo.

Stick to the Pizza maybe?  I had a slice of my nephew's cheese and it seemed pretty good. I ordered the baked ziti and found it lacked flavor. When I saw they used sausage in the dish I was hoping for some spice, some sweetness, some spoiled meat taste, ANYTHING! Instead I got a big plate of bland. The only bite I took that was flavorful incorporated nearly half of the mozzarella topping.  The garlic bread nuggets served as an appetizer were very good. I was just expecting more from the pasta.

Nice little breakfast place. Very small though (I think they do most of their work catering). I had the breakfast burrito and a cinnamon roll with coffee and it satisfied. The service was excellent.

I really liked the ambiance here. I went here for a business dinner and it was a nice, relaxed atmosphere. I'm always happy to find a spot that serves good mole, and this fits the bill. My boss was also raving about their Moscow mules. Nice work, Richardson's.

Came here with the family after a trip to the RR museum across the street. Orders were accurate and everybody seemed to be happy with their food. I enjoyed  my open faced chicken parm, but it could've done better with a little less kale. Also, they don't start serving pasta until 3 PM. As a archetypal Joe Pesci-type character might say: "What the fuck is that shit?"

The good: Get the table side mozzarella. I thought it was very good, and the choice of seasoning salts is a nice touch. I had the braised beef spare ribs and they were delicious: tender, shredded with a fork, and great flavor. The gnocchi were perfect with a light, fluffy texture and were a great compliment to the garlic spinach. The ambiance was also nice, with dim lighting interwoven with firelight.  The bad: My friend's salmon was just ok. For over $20, it should've been much better.  The ugly: Nothing. Overall, a very nice place.

This is one of my least favorite places in all of Phoenix. I'll grant you that I'm more than a little biased against 'clubs' in general (I'd rather relax, talk, and laugh than get bumped around, shout, and pay $15 for a whiskey after waiting in line for 15 minutes).   That being said, this place is the worst of the worst as far as clientele goes. Every Phoenician has heard of the $35K / year Scottsdale millionaire. Well, this is where they all come on Friday and Saturday nights to take on more crushing credit card debt so they can pop some bottles and impress some trashy women.   Are you a male in your twenties that likes cranberry mixers, works in 'finance' (read: entry level teller at Chase), leases a 328i, is not above slipping something in a girl's drink, and pretends to be some kind of pseudo-cowboy hardass at Country Thunder once a year? Then you'll love it here among your friends.  Are you a woman that is attracted to the aforementioned Scottsdale Bro? You'll love it here as well.

I would give this place 4 stars based on the food alone. I had the ribs and their texture was awesome. I'm talking cliche falling off the bone delicious. They also had a nice little subtle spice to them. I'm also a big fan of the poblano mashed potatoes.  The extra star, however, is for the owner. He came out after our meal was finished to see how our food was and spent about 10 minutes having a nice conversation with my party of 6. I'm sure he had other things he could have rushed off and done, but his personal touch really meant a lot. It's not something you see much anymore outside of ultra-high class restaurants.

They take a hunk of their chocolate cake and grind it up into a regular milkshake, thereby creating a chocolate cake shake. Nothing else I could write could really be more of a ringing endorsement than that statement of fact.  If, however, ringing endorsements are your thing, let the following chime out: This place is the perfect remedy for the ravenously hungry. Do it the right way and get your italian beef soaked in the gravy for a few seconds. I like it with the hot peppers and the mozz along with a spicy italian sausage. I'm not fat yet, but I aspire to be.

The music, and only the music, saved this bar from a one star rating. A country bar shouldn't be trendy, it shouldn't have a 15 minute line out the front, it shouldn't be easy to spot idiots in RVCA gear, and it DAMN sure shouldn't cost more than $10 for a Jim Beam on the rocks.   This place sucks. Go somewhere else.

It's like Chipotle/Qdoba/Subway/etc. meets pizza, and the results are not surprisingly delicious. You can't really go wrong--I like to start with one of their prebuilt pizzas and then customize it. I don't really trust myself with the raw power of building one from scratch; I'd abuse the authority. I do, however, allow myself the freedom of throwing some salty, briney, delicious kalamata olives on whatever the hell I'm having them build. As the wise woman once said: "Lay off me, for I am starving!"

I was honestly expecting this to be quite a bit better. Their Stout was bland and my mushroom cheeseburger, while good, lacked something. This place gets a lot of good reviews, and the service was pretty good, so I guess I'll just chalk it up to my personal taste. This is me whining. Wah!

How quintessentially Phoenix: An outstanding restaurant tucked away in an unassuming little spot in an aesthetically sterile strip mall. Good, I say. Let the food speak for itself.  Well, this food won't shut up--and I mean that in a good way. In fact, it pretty much cups you by the jaw and screams in your face: "I AM DELICIOUS. CONSUME AS MUCH OF ME AS YOU CAN!" I had the brisket and it was perfect. Perfect amount of fat. Perfect crust from the dry rub on the outside. Perfect texture. Both the sweet and hot sauces are winners on their own, but I like to go half and half to make a sweet heat concoction. Next time I might just try the dry rub, though.   Their mac 'n cheese is very good, creamy with a little bit of gritty feel that I'm guessing comes from the fact that it's baked and has a little grated parm mixed in. The beans have some spice and an overall pleasing flavor. Cornbread was good, but honestly, it's pretty hard to screw up cornbread.  And, for dessert, a long john doughnut with maple frosting and...eek!...little morsels of bacon sitting nonchalantly on top. That speaks for itself.  Carnivores: Go eat here now! Vegetarians: Sucks to suck!

Really good coffee, but I was hoping for a greater assortment of pastries. Granted, I came in late afternoon.  I was also hoping for more of a Brazilian feel to the place (for instance, empadas instead of empanadas), but at the end of the day, the coffee is king, and this place does a very nice job.

I really have to laugh at all the angry people leaving reviews on here. They're probably the sort that rant and rave about how "amaze-balls" Pizza Hut's trendy new crusts are, or who take shots of Papa John's florescent phosphorescent garlic sauce for breakfast. I see a lot of comparisons to Totino's frozen pizza too, and really, that should tell you all that you need to know. You obviously can't trust the culinary judgement of somebody who has willingly ingested a Totino's frozen pizza.  Like many on here, I grew up in Dubuque (And yes, I will party 'till I puke. Thanks for asking!), and I have many fond memories of birthday parties at that location, all the way up through high school first dates. It's a community fixture in a sleepy Iowa town, and for some people that is enough to sing the praises of the chain. For those of you that feel differently, you should try to calm down, be nice, and not be so quick to defecate on a business in the nascent stages of its existence.  When I go to the location in Dubuque, I'm genuinely looking forward to the pizza--and I don't even go for the taco, the old fashioned garden, or the Canadian bacon and sauerkraut. I just get plain old pepperoni. The nostalgia is on the side, but I can take it or leave it.  No, what keeps me coming back is the sauce. It is a great combination of the perfect amounts of sweet and spicy. I love the crust, which kind of has a slightly bubbly saltine cracker pattern on the bottom that is perfectly crunchy, yet with just the right amount of give near the top. I like how the toppings don't stop, they just kind of fade into the airy, pliable, and slightly chewy end crust. I don't know what blend of cheese they use, but it is unique and delicious, and doled out in perfect proportion to the amount of sauce and the other toppings. Put a Happy Joe's pepperoni pizza in front of me, and my mandible goes on auto pilot. I'll eat the whole thing, or possibly die trying.  So yes, some of us DO love this pizza for what it is. Do you really think if it was as awful as you claim, it would inspire such far-flung brand loyalty? Would we really crave it out here in the desert just because we fondly remember all the crazy detritus on the walls inside the Eastern Iowa location?   Perhaps the rest of you should take a lesson from the Hawkeyes on this board. Calm down. Be nice. Stop pretending to be Yelp's 895,334,234,234,432,434th digital incarnation of Gordon Ramsay. You probably won't be any worse off for abstaining from another anonymous tirade, and as an added benefit, you just might stop yourself from ruining it for the rest of us.
