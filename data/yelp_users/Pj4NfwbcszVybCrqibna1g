If I could give it zero stars I would. Worst service I have ever had at a restaurant in my entire 29 years of life. I was with a large group of 10 people and we ordered some beers and food (coming to an "oyster house" and being told they don't recommend them on the half shell) and when we got our food the waiter got our order completely wrong and when we told her what happened instead of apologizing and offering to make it right she proceeded to tell us that was what we had ordered and that we were the ones who were wrong! I couldn't believe my ears! When I politely told her again that was not what we had ordered she kept arguing with us and then just took the food and left. I was beside myself. I have never been treated so badly in a restaurant before. I then asked to speak to a supervisor and she shot back that there was not a supervisor on that night. Yeah I believe that. So we promptly left and were NEVER not once offered one single apology, instead we were told that we were wrong and then ignored. Will never set foot in this establishment again and I hope to speak with the owner to let him/her know the level of wait staff they have representing their restaurant.

This little joint serves nothing but chicken fingers, waffle fries, and texas toast (among a few other things) and they do it WELL!  The place is decorated with a bunch of old rock n roll memorabilia which I think is really cool and he even has an old jukebox in there!  The chicken fingers are in one word : AMAZING.  They are very lightly breaded and fried in trans fat free oil (I know still not the healthiest thing but they are GOOD) and they are moist and tender and juicy every time.  The waffle fries are the best compliment to the fingers and the selection of homemade sauces can't be beat (special sauce highly recommended)!  Overall this place is where you want to go when you are craving some of those delicious little chicken fingers that everyone loves!  Family owned and operated!  Oh and little tip, try to call to see if they are open, sometimes when business is slow they close early ;-)

If you are looking for a GREAT family owned place to get some excellent Mexican food look no further!  This place is awesome from the authentic selection of meats to fill your tacos and burritos with to the handmade chunky guacamole that is made for EACH person as they order it right in front of you!  The owner Rudy himself is always nice and welcomes you with a smile.  The restaurant is staffed with his family members and they are always quick and very helpful.  The carne asada is some of the best I have ever had!  Not much seating inside and they do have some outside but we usually just get it to go and enjoy it at home.  They have AMAZING tamales but don't always have them in stock so don't forget to ask!  Overall this is one of if not my absolute favorite place to get a burrito and some handmade guac!

I live nearby and was pleasantly surprised when a southern bbq joint opened up nearby. I stopped in one day for lunch and had the beef brisket sandwich and since I took it to go they put the meat in a separate container from the grilled bun. I added a side of waffle fries and they include the drink at no charge. The brisket was meaty and flavorful one of the best I have ever had. Their sauce is nice and subtle without too much vinegar or sugar. The waffle fries were perfectly done and they left the salting to me which I like.  I decided to go back to try the ribs as the very friendly guy (son in law of owner I think) told me he hand dry rubs and smokes them for 14 hours.  When I finally went back and tried the ribs I added macaroni and cheese and ate there. The ribs were absolutely the best I have ever tasted in my life and I LOVE ribs. The meat slides right off the bone and they are dry rubbed to perfection. No need for sauce even but since theirs is good I used a little and they were that much better. Best bbq in the valley hands down I will never eat ribs anywhere else in AZ for sure.
