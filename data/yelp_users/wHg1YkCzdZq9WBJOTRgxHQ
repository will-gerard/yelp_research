I'm not sure someone who is tone deaf has any business reviewing the Phoenix Symphony, but here is my unqualified take on it minus any technical critique.  It's something everyone should go to at least once, even if you think it's not for you.  And don't buy into the tales of these evildoers that wander around Yelp complaining there is no culture in Phoenix.  The musicians are talented, at least in this tone-deaf Yelper's humble opinion.  We've gone to a few performances.  The Mr. prefers the Classical series which is enjoyable even if sometimes I want to take a nap.  I prefer the Pop series.  And mixed in with this are a variety of holiday performances (the Hocus Pocus Halloween performance was really entertaining!)  On the plate for next Spring...an Elvis tribute.  Yep, I'll be there.  Also Simon & Garfunkel and McCartney/Beatles tributes, and music from the 30's & 40's.    Now between all that and the Classical stuff, there really is something for everyone.  Also, I'm on their mailing list and recently got a 48% off if you purchased tickets within 48 hours for Hocus Pocus.  I love a good deal!  One final note.  One of the musicians has an assist dog who is darn cute and had a pumpkin cape on last time.  How can you say no to that?

What the hell happened to beer and wine and free appetizers at Adults' Night Out?!!  Although I didn't always partake, it was nice to know it was there if I needed it.    Adults' Night Out is offered the first Friday night of each month after closing.  It's free to visit the exhibits and attend a lecture.  There's also an IMAX showing or Planetarium presentation that you pay extra for.  And the best part-it's child free!!!!!  This last week was the first time my husband and visited the new Dorrance Planetarium.  It's state-of-the-art and a great show.  Neal was our presenter, and I have to say, he is absolutely hilarious.  Although we did watch a recorded film on black holes, part of the presentation was history and stories related to various constellations.  Neal catered the lecture somewhat to the fact it was Adults' Night, and there was some more adult material.  I felt like I was at a comedy show with special effects.    Now, if only they can do something about the beverage situation.

I can't speak for the food, but this is a wonderful place for an old-fashioned frozen treat...that means no bacon involved.  Well truthfully, they have so many ice cream soda flavors, there might be a bacon one.  But you won't find it in the Thrifty ice cream!  You'll take a step back in time once you walk through the doors.  Floats, shakes, sundaes, malts, sodas, egg creams, and phosphates.  They're all here.  I don't even know what an egg cream is, but I would guess I would like it.  The cherry phosphate was also a first for me.  I'm still not sure what to think of it.  Kind of medicinal at first, but the more you drink, the more you like it.  The vanilla malt was vanilla-ey and malty.  What else can you say?

If you've never been to the Luminarias or haven't been in a few years, THIS IS THE YEAR TO GO!   It's a 2 for 1 deal with the Chihuly exhibit.  The Garden is filled with his glass sculptures perfectly displayed among the natural elements of the Garden.  The lighting of sculptures is stunning.  And, of course, the luminarias are always beautiful.  Meal tickets are available.  There are also cash bars with both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages including hot cider and cocoa.  Wine tasting as well.  There are plenty of entertainers scattered throughout the Garden.  I always enjoy the Handbell Choirs especially.  Adult tickets are $20 members, $25 non-members.  Reduced prices for kids, but I don't really think the young ones would enjoy it.  Expect it to be crowded this year.  We attended a members only night and it seemed to be oversold as parking was hard to come by.  However, if you venture away from the Chihuly exhibits, you can find a moment or two in solitude among the luminarias.  That alone is worth the ticket.

Great place for old school pizza and wings.  Bare bones restaurant in dire need of updating, but good pizza.  While waiting for a table, I ordered a glass of house cab, not good, but I drank it anyway.

If you've been to this zoo once or twice and think you've seen it all, think again.  I had been to this zoo a few times over the years before moving to the Valley and thought it was a relatively nice zoo, but I had the same complaints as others who visit infrequently...namely the animals are not putting on a show.  I have since learned it's not the animals that need to change, it's YOU.  If you find your favorite animal is always asleep in the afternoon, go in the morning.  If you find the animals are hiding out in the August heat, try going in March.  Animals are largely creatures of habit, and the zoo is their home.  They are not there to entertain you.  However, if you vary your schedule, you will see something new nearly every time you visit.  I have seen the tigers in trees, the male lion (who is nearly always asleep) roaring at the crowd, the otters chasing each other and "talking" to the visitors.  This zoo is spread out, so expect to walk a little.  In fact, it's a great place to get some exercise.  If you go in the summer, go EARLY unless you are doing a sleep study on the animals.  Also, you may want to avoid Spring Break weeks if you don't care to be surrounded by thousands of screaming kids running around.  Those days it is truly a zoo.  I highly recommend purchasing a membership.  It pays for itself in only a few trips, and even if you don't go more than that, it's a terrific way to support animal care and conservation.  The zoo is more involved in conservation than you might think.

Thanks to Deb L's plus one, we stopped in a few weeks ago to check out drawer hardware.  It's like a virtual cornucopia of all things HGTV.  If you need handle pulls, door knobs, bath fixtures, anything hardware, this is the place to go.  Just not if you need it in a hurry as most of the product is special order.  Will definitely return when we have a master bath or kitchen remodel.  These two we won't be doing ourselves.  We'd like to save our marriage.

STORE IS CLOSING :( :( :(  I guess there's no point in going into great detail about what a wonderful little gift shop this is.  I stopped in today to see if they still had a garden statue I saw last month (they didn't) and found the owner is "retiring" the store.  Great buys to be had.  All Christmas related is 75% off and everything else is 40% off.  No official date for closing, but expected to be open through February.

My first experience with PCG was at a small, yet fantastic Yelp event.  I've been back twice and have been just as impressed.  The first time was for brunch, and I recommend the griddled corn cakes.  No, I just don't recommend them, I insist you have them.  Even if you are allergic to corn, take the plunge and try these...unless you might die, then stay away as that might be bad PR for PCG.  Topped with smoked ham (that's what I had), chicken, or bacon and served with maple syrup, it was beyond good.  I could eat this dish every day of my life.  The black beans were okay, but I do think the breakfast potatoes are nothing special and could be improved upon.  I was a big fan of a $4 mimosa, however!  Yep, you read that right...4 bucks!  Second visit for dinner, and I ordered the cedar planked salmon.  A generous piece of fish perfectly cooked and served with a delicious lemon aioli.  The accompanying roasted beets were not my thing, and the mashed potatoes were okay (maybe I'm picky about potatoes?)  I also tried a bit of my dining companion's beef tenderloin and it was butter-knife tender (that's what I cut it with).  Served with a stuffed potato and mushrooms, I believe, it will most likely be my next entree.  For dessert, we shared the Jack Daniel's croissant bread pudding.  We actually shared half, and I most generously took the other half to my husband who I left at home.  Although, I generally don't care for bread pudding, this is NOT your typical bread pudding and probably the best bread pudding you can imagine (other than that one recipe that uses a dozen Krispy Kreme doughnuts).  Although PCG is a little bit of a drive for me (outside my usual 5-mile maximum radius), I will happily make that drive and return again.

So it looks like I'm reviewing jewelry stores today.  I came here with my perpetually broke but quite bejeweled friend a few months ago.  I will say that any jeweler with a sales lady who practically begs me to try on a $140,000 diamond ring and gives me a bottle of water is 5-stars in my book!

WOW!!!  That's all I can say.    Well not really.  Fabulous event.  I've been to the Scottsdale location, but not in quite some time, so this was a great reminder of what a fool I am.  I should be dining here every night!  We were treated to a sampling of the offerings on their new Plates menu...mini tenderloin sliders, lobster rolls, and crab sliders, along with roasted red pepper soup, truffle fries, calamari, shrimp...  All were delectable, but gotta go with the tenderloin here.  Unbelievably tender.  I am also shocked to say I was a fan of the coconut cream pie bites.  Let me preface by saying I generally despise coconut cream pie.  No one was more shocked than I to find this was a little bite of heaven.  And the wine was poured freely along with their signature Stoli Doli (pineapple martini) and Bohemians!  But where CG really excels is service.  Everyone working the event was personable and professional...a tough combination it seems.  And the chef was at the top of the list, answering even the dumbest of questions of mine (like why you age beef to begin with).   So a huge round of applause to all the folks at Capital Grille and to Lindsey for another spectacular Elite event.  With January events at both the Pointe and Capital Grille, we're getting spoiled!

My first experience with Cyprus was about 4 years ago.  My husband was living in the neighborhood, but I was still in denial about moving to the Valley.  It was like a little vacation to come to "the city" and stay in our Biltmore apartment.  The novelty wore off quick once I moved here, but I still enjoy Cyprus.  It makes a nice precursor to a movie at AMC.  At Cyprus, my husband and I can both get get pitas, hummus, and drinks...or we can share the water fountain and 7 kernels of popcorn at the movies for the same price.  My favorite part about Cyprus is the pita bread.  It's thick cushy pita, not the flavored cardboard pita they somehow manage to split open to make a pocket.  I'm a little partial to the chicken souvlaki with it's tangy tzatziki sauce, crunchy cucumbers, fresh lettuce and tomato.  The hummus is always tasty, although I seem to remember it being just a little better in the old days.  Not sure if they changed the recipe, or its just me remembering it differently.  The only downside, the last two times I've been in we have been waited on by girls.  What happened to the Greek Gods?  Minus a star for that!

I've never had Cajun food in Louisiana so I can't make a comparison even if I wanted to, which I don't.  It seems a lot of people like to complain about ethnic food being Americanized or regional styles not living up to expectations.  We live in Phoenix people-Phoenix, AZ, USA, not Phoenix, Japan or Phoenix, New York.  I have eaten Mexican food in Kentucky of all places.  Was it the style of food I am used to being a native Arizonan?  No, but I can appreciate that it wasn't bad, just someone else's interpretation.  So, the end result is I like Baby Kay's.  I've eaten here several times and never had a dish I didn't like, nor bad service.  I like that their hushpuppies actually have flavor beyond that of a wad of cornmeal.  I like the gumbo and jambalaya.  I tried the crawfish ettouffe and it was great.  I like that the potato salad is not swimming in some overly sweetened mayo concoction.  So while it may or may not compare to your version of authentic Cajun cooking, it is still a great place for a meal.

I think a clinically retarded person designed the layout of this store.  I stopped in a few days ago and was pleasantly surprised to see the registers were not at the front door anymore.  I hated that my first impression was a line of people.  So no more lines at the front.  Nice.  Now you have open space.  I love that.  Maybe the idiot that did the initial design has moved on.  But wait, I need to pay for my item.  Where are the registers?  They are mysteriously nonexistent.  I had to ask the guy guarding the front door where to pay.  He has to lead me to the back of the store and find an available employee-I guess one who is authorized to handle money??  First, they want to know how I'm planning to pay.  I don't know where I would have been led had I said "cash," a back alley maybe.  But since it was a credit card, I was led to another location where my transaction could be processed from a portable machine.  Okay, that's cool, but how exactly do you cue customers with this system?  If someone is already helping you, great.  But if not, good luck finding someone to take your money.    This is a recipe for chaos, and buying on-line just became that much more attractive.

Although I haven't had the pleasure of dining at Vincent's of Camelback, I became a fan of his little brother, Vincent Market Bistro, after just one visit.  Although I thought there were a few too many tables in this small space, I still found it cozy and intimate.  I had a hard time deciding between trying a pizza (the Four Cheese had my attention with mozzarella, bleu, brie, and goat cheeses with pesto) or a full-blown dinner (particularly the Shrimp Crepe with avocado corn salsa).  But the Prix Fixe won with three courses for a very reasonable price ($25 I think).    They allowed me to substitute lobster bisque for the soup offered, and it was very rich, and buttery, and lobstery.  The halibut/sea bass duo was my preferred entree.  Perfectly cooked, perfectly sized given it was sandwiched between a cream soup and dessert.  The pot de creme was surprisingly and pleasantly, not chocolate.  Although I like chocolate, I prefer it as an element of a dessert, not the main ingredient.  Only "getting too old to remember shit" me can't remember the flavor..I believe it was raspberry.  What I do remember is that it was very good.  Our server was delightful in responding to our 101 questions about the menu.  It was a lovely meal overall.  Note to self:  go back soon.

I loved this car wash..once I figured out how to get into it (easiest to enter from 44th street).  No Cheesecake Factory menu that takes 20 minutes to read and figure out what the difference is between the $4 wash, the $7 wash, the $12 wash...you get the idea.  I took my husband's vehicle in while he was out of town.  I know, I'm nice like that.  $25 for an SUV complete wash.  This is a true hand wash.  No conveyor belts or automated water squirter things.  Guys with hoses who do a really good job.  They use compressed air to dry, and I watched them go over and over the car to make sure nothing was missed.  I was hard-pressed to find any water streaks.  It can be slow, but it's worth it.  The only downside is the waiting area is outside (covered), so I don't anticipate his vehicle's next wash until November.  Luckily, my 10 year old vehicle has no aversions to machine washes.  But then again, It would be lucky to get washed before November anyway.

Put your eatin' britches on.  You know it's going to be good when the parking lot is full at what appears on the outside to be a food-related illness waiting to happen.    I tried the Windy City Slider with cheese.  Comes with chopped onion, pickles, and what I thought was standard ketchup.  Upon further taste investigation, I think it's actually a blend of ketchup and Dijon mustard.  Whatever it was, can't wait to see it again.  The buns are perfect.  I ordered two and was more than satisfied.  Also tried the fries.  A little thick for my taste, but hot, crispy, and perfectly salted.  And last, but certainly not least, a vanilla milkshake.  Oh so good, especially considering it's a hundred fifty freakin' degrees out today.  My only wee little complaint.  The place was a little less than clean, but it was still very busy at what appeared to be the tail end of the lunch rush.  Don't look at the walls or under the tables and you'll be fine.

I should have bought a house in Sunnyslope.  Los Reyes de la Torta and El Bravo in the same neighborhood.  It's like a dream come true.    El Bravo has been on my list for a while now, and I finally made it a few weeks ago.  The typical "not much to look at from the outside" place, but I found the inside to be, dare I say, charming with it's colorful walls and mural.  Seat yourself and the wait is not long for chips and salsa.  The salsa was mild, but tasted fresh.  The hot sauce in the ever so popular in Arizona squirt bottle was a little hotter with good strong oregano flavor.  Yes, they do charge for chips, but it's a buck.  Nothing to get bent about, and the rest of the menu is priced affordably.  To maximize my sampling pleasure, I ordered a 3-way burro so that I could try both the red chile and green chile (both made with beef), beans, and tortillas without ordering too much.  Pretty resourceful, I know.  I also ordered the green corn chicken tamale.  The beans were good, but a little too seasoned for me.  Not overly seasoned, but I'm a minimalist when it comes to beans.  Salt does it for me.  The red chile was made with shredded beef, while the green was made with cubes.  Both were tasty, but I couldn't detect one being hotter than the other, but you know how 3-ways are.  The tortillas were really good!  Maybe a little less "floury" than say a Carolina's tortilla.  Now the tamale was perfection.  I'm usually never impressed by a restaurant tamale's masa.  There's either way too much, or it's too tough or too soft, and it never tastes like home-made, maybe because they're restaurant-made.  El Bravo has it down.  I ordered mine without sauce, and it was served out of the husk, so I'm pretty sure they are made with only one husk.  I like the 2 or 3 husk version so you can peel away the layers....mmm, mmm.    So, it's too late to make a long story short, but El Bravo is now my new favorite table-service Mexican restaurant for good ole Sonoran fare.

More like Whole Paycheck Market.    Looking for a way to lessen the mental anguish I feel when I think about where my burger comes from, but not ready to abandon my hypocrisy and actually become a vegetarian, I've been looking for sources of meat, poultry, and pork that actually have some standards regarding the humane treatment of the animals in our food chain (aside from their eventual slaughter, of course).  I'm also lazy and prefer one-stop shopping.  After reading some positive information on their website (and hoping it's at least partially true), I headed to Whole Foods to check out their offerings.  First off, their seafood selection was really incredible.  Since I wasn't going to be able to cook it in the next few days, I settled on some frozen salmon filets certified by the Marine Stewardship Council.  That means they can charge $7 for an 8-oz filet.  Off to the meat counter.  I purchased flank steak for $15/lb.  First off, I would like to know why flank steak is ever more than free.  It's a crappy cut of meat in my opinion, but works well for slow cooking.  I also purchased stew meat for $9/lb.  Stew meat!  Another crappy cut of meat.  Needless to say, I did not buy steaks at WFM.  What about pork?  Again, ridiculous prices for chops.  Chicken?  I did find prepackaged chicken for $4.99/lb.    I did not bother checking out their organic produce since I'm more than happy to consume pesticides like my forefathers.  And wasn't there a big stink lately about some of the frozen produce at WFM labeled "organic" actually coming from China? A variety of other items also made their way into my cart totaling $188 for very little.  Needless to say, WFM will not be a grocery store I frequent regularly, but with their pretty amazing selection of seafood, prepared foods, cheese, locally made breads, I will be back occasionally.  I'm a fan of the store, just not their prices.  As for beef, I found a ranch in Arizona that makes monthly deliveries to the Valley and charges half of WFM without the middle man.  Sorry little piggies in your crates and chicks in your cages, I'm still looking:(

I had never been to a Ruby Tuesday's outside of Flagstaff Mall and was never impressed with that one.  We ended up here because it appears to be the only actual restaurant inside PV Mall, and it was too hot to walk across the street.  Now, I don't know if the menus vary by restaurants, but this one had a completely different menu than the restaurant in Flag.  Much smaller and much better.  I had an avocado quesadilla.  Now you may think it would be hard to screw that up, but I was prepared for some green crap mildly resembling avocado, but it was actually the real thing.  My husband had the chicken pot pie.  That looked yummy-it was in a bowl of puffed pastry.  He was pleased.  Great salad bar, too.  What stood out was the service.  Excellent.  Would definitely come here again, but probably would still shy away from the chain otherwise.

While I appreciate a good steak occasionally, I don't appreciate $9 baked potatoes.  I'm sorry, but if I'm paying $40 for a piece of meat, is it too much to ask to throw in the potato? This quirk has eliminated a growing number of steakhouses from my list of dining options.  I'm happy to report that Stockyards agrees with me.  Although the area leaves a lot to be desired, I love that this restaurant is rich in Arizona history.  I love the building (check out the bar) and it's Old West charm.  And I love that it's still here after decades of change in the Valley.    The restaurant is quite large with several rooms.  Nice enough to dress up a little, but still comfortable enough for casual attire.  That's "casual," not pajama bottoms and bed head.  This isn't Safeway.  My dining companion and I shared the Chateaubriand for Two (in other words, me and the dude I married ate a big tenderloin).  The steak was really good and perfectly tender.  It was served with the expected Bearnaise (which I didn't care for) and a house steak sauce which was better.  Also included were mashed potatoes, whiskey sweet potato mash, mushrooms, and "seasonal" vegetables, in addition to the salad, corn muffins, and biscuits served at the beginning.  A lot of food for $80!  The mashed potatoes were average (but they weren't $9), and the vegetables were a disappointment, consisting of nothing but julienned carrots and some broccoli.  The sweet potato mash was very tasty, however.  Did you know it's possible to eat sweet potatoes without marshmallows?  Crazy, I know.  While I thought some of the food was closer to 3 stars, I can't help but bump it up to 4 given the overall experience.

At first glance, my Yelp buddies may be thinking "Finally!  She's put the lid on that can of crazy and adopted a new pet!  Too bad it needs a neurologist."  Well, no I haven't. That shows you what my list of unfinished reviews looks like.  So here's my review from my August 2011 visit.  Rest assured, it was so traumatizing I can accurately remember the pertinent details.  After my kitty suffered a severe seizure, losing her eyesight, the emergency clinic recommended a neuro consult as they were unable to pinpoint the cause.    So we loaded up our already deaf, now blind, and extremely pissed off family member into the car and  headed from one hospital to another.  The facility is in an odd industrial area, but it was very clean and the staff friendly.  We were greeted promptly and had a minimal wait.  Suzi was first thoroughly examined by an resident.  She was minimally cooperative, but he was good with her.  He then took her to another room for a second examination by a neurologist, Dr. Evans.  We were not offered the opportunity to accompany Suzi, but we were not exactly at the top of her list anyway.  Following Dr. Evan's exam, he did meet with us to report his findings.  His best guess was a brain tumor, but in absence of an MRI, he could not be certain.  We discussed treatment options; however, as she was already 19, I was not willing to consider surgery or radiation.  He suggested a course of steroids which could reduce any swelling causing the blindness.  The only thing preventing me from a 5-star review was the topic of the MRI.  While I did not feel pressured, I was encouraged to move forward with it for a definitive diagnosis even after I expressed concern over her age and current weakened state following the seizures.  I asked if the MRI were positive what conservative treatment was available.  The answer...a course of steroids, the same thing if it were negative.  I fully understand it was their obligation to communicate all available diagnostics and treatments available, but I also understand that I could have easily been swayed to spend $3000 just for peace of mind in my case.  The steroids did appear to help as Suzi's sight returned and she had 3 more months seizure-free.  Dr. Evans' best guess diagnosis appeared to be accurate, as she did exhibit additional symptoms pointing to a brain tumor just before we euthanized her.  I would not hesitate to trust this facility again should the need arise.

Although I live nowhere near Summers, I happened to notice their produce stand on the way to an event at the Humane Society, so I stopped on my way home.  Lots of produce, of course, and a good selection of pickled and canned items as well.  I found the staff to be so friendly, offering samples of a few different fruits and even going to the trouble to point out that they had less expensive lemons than the locally grown variety I was purchasing.  Both varieties of dates I purchased were excellent, although, why do they have to look like big 'ole cockroaches?  Can't someone engineer a more attractive fruit?  Anyhow, definitely worth a stop if you live in the neighborhood.  Keep in mind their prices are for cash payment.  Using a card will cost you more, but I'm not sure how much.

Technically, Roy's is outside the northern boundary of which I would drive for a meal, but since it was to be a free meal and I wouldn't be doing the driving, how could I say no?  It is a chain, but in Roy's defense, the majority of the menu items are created by the local chefs with only a portion of the menu available at all restaurants.  Roy's is billed as Hawaiian fusion, but my first thought was "oh no, there's sushi on the menu, I won't like this place."  I am happy to say I was wrong.  Don't let my husband read this.  He thinks I'm never wrong.  My husband also always says I'm stuck in the 80's, so I ordered the 1988 cocktail (grapefruit and pomegranate with a grapefruit vodka and lychee liqueur).  Since I was the lone drinker, I stuck with one, but could have easily had 2 or 3 more of these, especially with a little Duran Duran background music.    We started with Roy's Canoe Appetizer for Two, adjusted for three.  It includes lobster potstickers and teppanyaki shrimp, both of which were really good.  Also on the boat were Thai beef satay and spicy tuna roll, neither of which I tried.  My husband vouched for the tuna roll, however.  Next up was the grilled endive, apple, and bleu cheese salad with pomegranate vinaigrette.  If you're a salad lover, you would probably love it.  If you're a salad hater, you would probably love it, too.  For my entree, the pancetta crusted Alaskan halibut with tomatoes and chevre, mushroom ravioli.  This, too, was fantastic, although there was a little too much oil on the plate, maybe from the pancetta??  But the fish was nicely prepared and the ravioli was excellent.  My husband insisted on the chocolate souffle which must be ordered at the start of your meal, but due to a glitch with our pregnant server needing a bathroom break, it didn't get put in early enough.  We waited and were given a starter dessert on the house, and both the server and the gal who forgot to put the order in both profusely apologized.  Hey, I would gladly welcome another screw up if a second dessert was involved.  The souffle was lick your plate good and the blueberry tart (I think that was the name of it) was incredibly good as well.  So good, I may have to break my driving rule and have dessert there again.  Probably 4.5 stars, but I'm feeling stingy today.

I drove through rush-hour traffic to get here.  It better be good, I'm thinking.  My dad was visiting, and by "visiting," I mean he came to trade a vehicle and visit a friend of his in Chandler.  Somehow I fell into the mix because of a pull-out sofa I guess.  Being a fan of Sonoran Mexican food, rather than New Mexican, I was skeptical.  Admittedly I have limited experience with New Mexican food, but usually I find the meat to be over-seasoned and the chili to be too hot for my taste.  However, these good people in Chandler are from the same small town along the border I am,  so I trusted their taste was similar to mine, and I was not disappointed.  Five stars from the top by serving four different dips with the hot, crisp tortilla chips (green, red, bean, and sour-cream based).  All were spicy, but addictive.  Only the first basket is free, but better than nuthin'  (I'm talking to you Mr. Carlsbad Tavern).  I had the flauta dinner after confirming they are made with corn, not flour tortillas.  Both the beef and the chicken were flavorful, but not overly seasoned.  I really liked the beans as well.  My husband had the chicken gorditas.  The chicken was, unfortunately, really dry.    It was a Friday night, and in spite of being extremely busy, we had excellent service as well.  Not even knocking off for the dry chicken.  Especially since I wasn't the one eating it.  Would I drive back to Chandler just to eat here?  Probably.  Just not during rush hour.  And why do they call it "rush-hour."  No one was rushing anywhere on the 101.  I am so glad I work from home.

Because the demographics of Yelp tell me there's a huge market for rockers and curios, I thought I would share my experience.  A little background info.  I like cats (ok, I love cats, more than people).  Therefore, for years, everyone wanted to give me cat-themed gifts.  I finally had to put an end to that.  I have since unloaded most of those items to other insane people.  However, I do have a collection of figurines (old person's word), most of which are either very old or from other countries..(except Germany because they don't know how to make cats).  To pacify my husband that barely tolerates the living cats in the house, I agree to contain them.  Thus, my need for a curio cabinet.  Rocker World supposedly has the largest selection in the Valley.  And they did have quite a few.  But because I was looking for something more contemporary, I had to order.  And because my husband was with me, I ordered quickly...too quickly.  Upon getting home, I found a cabinet I liked better on the internet.  I called the store to confirm they could order from that manufacturer, and Mel graciously obtained the dimensions and changed my order, allowing me to just pay the difference when it arrived.  It did take 6 weeks to get it, but the price was just as good as online and it arrived undamaged.  And all my kitties are happily locked up, staring at me every time I walk by.

I've gone ?? years (I've now reached the point where revealing my age is a bad, bad thing) thinking I didn't like peach pie.  I never had a Schnepf Farms peach pie.  You gotta be kidding me!  That pie was stupid good!  Ranks with the best pie I ever had.  It might be THE best pie I ever had.  Perfect filling without being loaded up with cinnamon, allowing those tree-ripe peaches to be the star.  Perfectly flaky, buttery crust.    As for the farm, we originally were going to go the first day of the peach festival, but after seeing some comments on Facebook about the crowds, we opted to head out early the next day.  And thankfully we did get there early, because by the time we left an hour or so later, it was already packed.  But we were able to make a quick walk to the orchards and pick some oh so sweet and juicy peaches.  I have been forever ruined by a grocery store peach.  You know, the kind where for every 6 peaches you buy, one is great, one is edible, and four are throw-aways.  I will now buy peaches only in the month of May directly from the tree!  We were also able to buy that pie and some already picked peaches of a different variety outside the store and sample some of the peach products.  We opted out of the pancake breakfast and the cinnamon rolls due to the lines, but that was okay with us.  There was a lot of griping about the crowds and Schnepf's ability to handle it, but I don't know that any small business could have done so.  I do think a few improvements could be made, however.  First on the list, upon arriving we thought the big line at the entrance was to get in, but it turned out to be the breakfast line.  Better signage or moving the breakfast line would help.  Also, with the breakfast line winding out the entrance, it was difficult to get in or out of the festival as the area just wasn't large enough.  A separate exit would make a world of difference in the congestion there.  And second, although you could buy pies outside the store, I believe the peach cinnamon rolls were only in the bakery which may have been the reason for the ridiculous line to get in there.  Having those bad boys available outside as well would be nice.  The rest of the problems just came with the crowds.  And we should all remember, this is a family farm first.  Even Disneyland doesn't always excel at crowd control.  Next time, we'll go before or after festival days to get our peaches and baked goodies.  Thank you Schnepf Farms!

The first time I went in, I expected it to be the Wal-Mart of book stores.  But it's actually nice.  No, there isn't a cafe, but I like that.  It's a pet peeve of mine to see people camped out in the store reading a book or magazine they haven't paid for, nor have any intention of buying.  Go to a damn library people.  If I am paying for a new book, I want it to be...I don't know, NEW maybe.  Staff is always friendly.  I called looking for a particular book, and the gal who answered the phone not only checked the stock on their computer, but OFFERED to make sure it was actually on the shelf and held it for me.  They accept Barnes & Noble gift cards and membership cards as well.

If I ever have the urge to spend more money on bedding than the current value of my house, this is the place to do it.  I actually learned of The Linen Tree when they were listed as a retailer of Molton Brown bath products on another website.  My first impression was not the best, however.  When I could not find a product on their website, I asked via on-line chat which was supposedly "open."  No one answered.  No worries, I emailed instead.  Again, I never received a response.  At that point I decided if they could not respond to a shampoo inquiry, I would never buy my next set of $777 bath towels here either.  And so I purchased the shampoo from Saks.  And for all you haters that now think I can only use the finest shampoo, it was not for me.  It was for my husband.  And any time a man is interested in any product related to hygiene, I recommend you ladies support him...no matter the cost.  The opposite extreme is far more costly.  Fast forward 2 weeks and I need drawer sachets as a gift.  So I did the unthinkable and went back to TLT when I struck out elsewhere.  And I am now in love with that store!  Kind of luck my husband.   Didn't care for him at first, but he grew on me.  In a good way, not like a tumor.  Anywho, what I found at TLT was a beautiful selection of all things bed and bath...linens, lovely soaps and bath products, accessories, and my drawer sachets.  There's also a nice selection of china, table linens and pretty decorative items.  As for the staff, they were very polite and helpful.  I'm only knocking a star for the rocky start.  TLT will definitely be on my list for gift items.  Maybe I'll even treat myself occasionally, too!

Fantastic happy hour with 5 wines, 5 cocktails, and 5 apps, each for $6.  My pal and I went with the sweet chile calamari and the mushroom ravioli and were not disappointed with either.  Fleming's is still on my list for dinner, but in the meantime, happy hour will do just fine.

:( A million sad faces for me.  My husband was out of town, so that was an opportunity for me to stop by on a whim.  I was convinced I would love it, and maybe  I would have had Los Favoritos had a working stove, or hell, even a microwave.  Everything was cold, except the beans oddly enough.  Maybe they had a little campfire going to keep those warm.  The taco shell was saturated in enchilada sauce because they failed to employ the necessary lettuce barrier between the two.  And it was chewy, like it had been fried some time ago.  The taco meat was cold.  The cheese enchilada was cold.  It had the consistency of once having been melted, but since re-solidified.  And the rice, well, I don't even remember.  I don't get it.  It was off hours, and there was only one other table in there.  The only thing I can think of was that the food had been made earlier and never served.  Maybe they were waiting for a take-out order to pass it off.  Only giving a second star because...I don't even know why.  I just don't want to relive the disappointment any longer.

My favorite neighborhood place for breakfast when I don't want a 30-minute wait for a table, a 30-minute wait for my food, and a $30 bill.  We had the longest wait ever on a Sunday at noon, and it was still only about 10 minutes.  Usually, your breakfast comes so fast you think Samantha Stephens must be in the kitchen.  Nothing special on the menu-typical diner fare but always hot and tasty.  Lunch and dinner aren't bad either.  Great prices.  I always have Randy's breakfast which is 2 eggs, 2 bacon strips, 2 sausage links, and 2 pancakes for $4.65, I think.  Servers have always been attentive as well.  It is true the place is packed with seniors who are inevitably standing in the middle of the walkways talking to their neighbors about Depends or the stock market or whatever else they talk about.  And Randy's doesn't take plastic-I don't mind since it's so cheap.  They did just put an ATM in the lobby and they also take checks.

Typical fun 50's diner atmosphere but good food nonetheless.  Tried their deep dish apple pie tonight.  Made like a pot pie with puffed pastry!!!!  Sinfully delicious.  Boo to Rhonda J for pointing out they have a website with nutritional info.  I checked it out and ain't nuthin' nutritional about it.  But boo to me for being so foolish as to look--especially AFTER I've eaten.  Makes me wonder...will there be 90's style diners someday.  Maybe internet cafes where kids are amazed we used to have to go places to use the internet and they are horrified at how big serving sizes were "back then."

"You Can Do It, We're No Help" should be their new slogan.  This location sucks.  Difficult to find help in any department.  Someone usually has to be "called" and that person is never in a hurry to get to you.  Selection is poor.  Indoor plants look like they have never seen water.  And the worst part, you are acosted by outside sales people (infomericals, Direct TV, etc) or their "free in-home project consult" people every time you come in.  Yes, I'm very confident they could manage a kitchen remodel when they can't answer a phone.  Yesterday we went through self-check and couldn't get the item to scan.  We notified the clerk working that area who told us we would have to wait--so she could watch the two guys in a full-service line buy plants.  Then she walked over to our kiosk, cleared the screen, and walked off but never scanned the item.  Needless to say, we left.  Unfortunately, we'll probably be back at some point because the Lowe's near our home is almost as bad with service.  In fact, I should review that place as well.  An extra star because I'm in a charitable mood.

I'm going to have to bump up my review of this particular Home Depot thanks to Anne..at least I think that was her name, but let's just call her the Queen of Thrones.  We had a running toilet that my husband tried to fix.  Yep, all that resulted was the need to replace the whole damn thing.  So we spent a lovely evening at HD browsing the commodes.  Picked out a sporty little model, but they don't really let you test drive it.  Enter Anne.  Do you need any help?  Nope, we got this.  Then the barrage of questions.  Do you want round or elongated?  Chair height or standard height?  Single flush or double flush?  Uh, does it matter?  Apparently, it does.  Men prefer elongated you know?  Why?  You could give them a target the size of a swimming pool, and they'll miss.  Men also often prefer chair height?  Why?  It's more comfortable for them, and we all know how much time the average man sits parked on the pot.  I'm pretty sure mine has a Playstation hidden in there somewhere.   Men also NEED the double flush.  Saving water is great, but if you have to flush six times, you really didn't.  She also made sure we got the right seal.  You need the double wax seal, not the standard wax the installer will try to use.  You also need an extra long flexible hosey thing (my words not hers) for the chair height.  So it's all about men.  Thanks to Anne, we flushed our original choice down the toilet (hahahah), and went with the super industrial man model-elongated, chair height, double flush.  I feel like a 2-year old on it, but he's happy.  And this is one sacrifice I'm willing to make.

4.5  Well after hearing a favorite former yelper sing the praises of the hot Italian beef, I finally made it in, cash in hand since no plastic.  I like that the place had not seen a decorator in 34 years.  Actually, I don't think it saw one then.  In a deli, I'm looking for a good sandwich for a good price.  I'm not interested in paying $17.95 for a turkey sandwich so they can recoup the cost of an overpriced interior designer.  And I got just that.  An excellent Italian beef sandwich as well as the biggest pickle I have ever seen.  And in following my new half-star policy, bumping up to 5 stars because the gals at the counter were so welcoming to everyone who came in.  And Mr. Casella himself took the time to say hello while we were waiting.  They also run a buy 2-get 1 free special during the week late afternoons.

As far as salad bar buffets go, I find Sweet Tomatoes to be well above average.  My pet peeve at salad bars is wilted or brown-edged greens.  I've eaten at this location many times and the produce has always been fresh-even in the salads that are already prepared.  I also love the soup selection.  There are 6 or 8 to choose from-some staples, some new ones each time.  I've found every soup to be pretty good.  If you've never been to a Sweet Tomatoes, there is also pasta and pizza, potato bar which includes baked SWEET POTATOES-yum, a variety of breads, and dessert of course.  Sometimes they bring warm cookies to your table.  Table service suffers during busy times, but never too bad.  I think this is a great place to go when it's either too hot to cook, you're not in the mood to cook, or your husband has to eat immediately or he turns into a lunatic without warning.

Thanks to Christina P for introducing me to Chop and Wok.  I would have never found my way in here otherwise, and I love it!  Nice laid back bar for those of you not into the whole typical Scottsdale scene.  You can actually order your food from the bar as well.  There's a large outdoor seating area in between the bar and the restaurant which seems to really be just take-out and delivery unless you enjoy baking in the Arizona heat.  I didn't mind the styrofoam plates or take-out boxes at all since I always need a box anyway.  As far as the food, most entrees run $6.50 for a small (pint) and $10 for a large (quart).  You can adjust the heat in your dishes, but even the ones that were ordered spicy were not that spicy.  The food is really good for what it is.  Keep your expectations in check.  The jalapeno puffs were excellent and a nice take on the crab puff.  This will most likely be a place I end up at the end of a long day.  The bartender/owner? was friendly, and it's just a comfortable place to be.

After reading the thread about holiday giving, I realized I had not reviewed Kidstop!  The only kid I know is my nephew, and I don't see him that often, so I'm always at a loss as to what to buy him.  Since it seems he has everything imaginable, his parents are useless resources.  Hmmm.  That's an interesting contradiction in terms, isn't it?  Kidstop saves the day every time!  They offer a huge selection of both educational and creative toys for kids of all ages.  Lots of the standards like games, trains, planes, and dolls, but they also have more educational things like science kits and erector sets.  I just found some cool stilts and parachute men last time, too!  My husband was sorely disappointed with our last visit, however.  Although they still sell the parts, they took down the Rokenbok display.  Now he has to shop like an adult.  So what did we buy this year?  A radio-controlled airplane that can be used in the house.  That one is for his parents to lament over.  And a magician's set of card tricks.  I'm pretty sure he's a little scheister in the making.

"Honey, can you stop at the grocery store and pick me up a loaf of bread and a sofa."  Seriously.  This store is crazy.  What is with Fry's anyway?  They run the gamut from "I need a surgical mask and gloves to shop here" to "I think I need to put on something nice to buy toilet paper."  This one is really nice.  It's like it's own shopping center with everything from indoor & outdoor furniture and accessories, toys, linens, appliances, and...oh yeah, food.    The grocery store at Marketplace (are all Marketplace's the same?) is so much nicer than at the regular Fry's stores.  Produce looks good, nice liquor selection, great deli with a wide variety of "heat and serve" entrees that are actually good, sushi, etc.  And if you need to pick up a few Christmas gifts after you grab your tampons, you're in luck.  One star off because I actually pulled into a parking space that was reserved for pregnant women.  WTF!  They had sex and now they can't walk?

Scratch my last review.  I'd rather give up the clean restrooms after all.  I was really disappointed at my last visit.  And let me tell you, it's hard to disappoint me if I'm having Mexican food.  But the salsa was blah, the green chile was blah, everything was blah.  I really should have considered the dire Mexican food situation in Scottsdale before moving here.  Now not only is my house worth less than my car, but I'm driving into Phoenix to eat anyway!

I was a customer with Arizona State for many years, but when they moved further north than they already were, it was just too far for me to drive to cope with a staff that seemed to have difficulty processing my lone monthly business check.  So I joined Desert Schools instead.  I'm happy to say the drive is much shorter, but incompetence still prevails.  My first week as a customer, I got a call informing me I need to change my password because a bank employee accidentally wiped it out. What?  A month or two later I was credited with a deposit I didn't make.  A month later, the error was still not caught, so I notified Desert Schools, and was advised where the deposit was made (a branch nowhere near me), and that additional research would come with a fee.  Let's just say I stopped being nice at that point.  I did meet at one point with the assistant branch manager regarding their security measures, or lack thereof it seems.  She happened to mention they had recently changed to a new computer system.  If this is an improvement,  their old one must have involved punch cards.  It takes FOREVER to run a deposit, even a single check.  And keep your eye on your account.  Their account numbers are consecutive (who does that?), so it's easy for an error to be made, and since only a partial number is printed on your receipt, you won't know who has your money until you verify it later.  With lower interest rates, if that's even possible, than my previous credit union and fees for using non-Desert Schools ATMs, I can't say I recommend Desert Schools.  But, it's too much hassle to change everything to a new bank again.

In full disclosure, I have never actually been to the Scottsdale Gun Club.  And after my attempts to contact them, I doubt I ever will.  My husband went with a buddy before Christmas, and talked about a membership.  The memberships are expensive, and I wasn't sure he was serious about it, so I considered purchasing a gift card online.  I wanted to make sure he could use it for range fees, and not just merchandise, but could never speak with anyone there.  Neither emails nor telephone calls were answered.  When I gave up, my mother decided to try her hand at it as well.  She called two different numbers on their website; no answer at either, and the calls were not returned.  So maybe this is a great range.  Maybe they have a great store.  But one thing is certain.  Their customer service is non-existent, and my husband's foolish dream of shooting together (as opposed to at each other) and buying me my very own gun are over if it means I ever have to step foot in this place.

You would think this place is actually in Mexico given how long I had been meaning to try it.  I can only say, I should have gone sooner.  Really good Mexican food-not the touristy crap or the Scottsdaled up version.  I tried the green chile and loved it.   Decor is nothing to write home about, but not a complete dive either.  Service was excellent.  I actually didn't find it all that cheap considering it's basic Mexican food, but I guess it's cheap for Scottsdale.  Dinners run about $12 on average.  Lunch about $7.  They also have breakfast.  On the bad side, they apparently have a lunch buffet.  God only knows how big my ass will get knowing that tidbit of information.  Five dollar a gallon gas may actually be a good thing.

Free airline tickets-check. Discount code for hotel stay-check. Free drink coupons-check. Discount code for show tickets-check. Budget transportation from airport-  Yeah, well my husband was in charge of that, and this is what happens.  But I will say, after the first-class Southwest flight where I had to drink my vodka with a splash of OJ in about 15 seconds, having a car was a nice treat.  Our driver was not only there on time, he actually called as we were on our way to baggage claim to advise which carousel he and our luggage were at.  He was both personable and professional.  And I didn't even have time to register it was hot outside before a glass of champagne was in hand.  I enjoyed the little drunk girls getting into their car asking "how do we get champagne?"  Our driver responded, "ride with our company."  Since our hotel was close, I drank it fast, and stashed the rest of the bottle in my bag.  Classy I know.  Our return driver was on time as well, and both cars were nice and clean.  For roughly $120 round trip, it was a nice little splurge.  Thanks husband for not always being a cheap-ass like your wife.

Great place to go in a stressful situation if you'd like to blow a couple grand and still not get a diagnosis!  I took my then 14-year old cat to this clinic last year on a Sunday with uncontrollable vomiting.  She's an indoor cat with no history of ingesting foreign bodies.  The initial vet I spoke to x-rayed her and performed blood tests which came up negative.  She was admitted for "overnight observation" on a Sunday morning as her vet was not available until Monday.  I was awakened by a 4 am phone call from another vet advising she needed "emergency" surgery that would cost $3500.  Why?  He didn't know, but stated since her vomiting was not responding well to medication, it was best to do the exploratory to look for this mysterious foreign body.  I insisted she at least wait a few hours until she could get an ultrasound at the adjacent clinic when they opened.  The ultrasound showed no indication of a foreign body or any other internal problems.  Later that morning, my own vet examined her and made an instant diagnosis of an allergic reaction to her new thyroid medication.   And yes, I had advised the emergency clinic of the medication, the dosage, and the length of time the cat had taken it, when I arrived.  She made a full recovery once back in the care of her regular doctor.    Had I not trusted my own instincts, I might have been influenced by the "expert" recommending this geriatric cat be operated on with no clinical indications.   However, don't be concerned about unauthorized medical treatment.  You are expected to pay for every test and treatment BEFORE they will do it.  I do give this clinic one star as the cat did manage to survive.

I attended last night's opening of The Lady With All the Answers with Dottsy Z courtesy of Yelp.  I had never been to the Herbeger and was very impressed with the theater.  I loved that it's small (rear to stage) and utilizes several balconies for adequate seating.  I doubt there's a bad seat in the house.  The play itself tells the story of Ann Landers as she struggles with a column.  Not a column giving advice, but a column in which she must reveal a personal dilemma.  She shares reader mail and incorporates her own recollections of significant events in her life through this process by which we learn about her.  The acting was very impressive, but it is a one-woman show.  I found the first half to be a little slow, but the second half was excellent.  I look forward to attending more performances here.

Since EVERYONE knows there's no culture in Arizona, my husband and I decided to waste an afternoon at the Phoenix Art Museum.  And it's really too bad their collections of American, Asian, Contemporary, and European art are non-existent, for example.  All sarcasm aside, not an easy feat for me, I really enjoy this museum.  Not having visited since the Yelp pARTy, I was anxious to come back.  Granted, I did miss the free food and drink, but it was still a great way to spend an afternoon.  I love the newly designed interior and I hope Kusama's "fireflies" exhibit stays forever.  I seriously wish I could camp out here.  I also really enjoyed Klett & Wolfe's "Charting the Canyon," exhibition.  If you are a fan of the Grand Canyon, this is a must see.  The two have layered their images with 19th century drawings and mid-century photos of the same locales.  Crazy inspirational, thought-provoking, creativity here.  With the hot weather ready to pounce, the Phoenix Art Museum is a great way to spend the day.  Just don't bother to look for a fish taco on your way.

Service so unspeakably bad, that I will Yelp about it instead.  Stopped for a drink before the Symphony.  It was a little busy, but nothing out of the ordinary.  There were a few empty tables...though most were dirty.  Waited for at least 10 minutes before a server passed by and said she would be back shortly.  Shortly turned into unacceptably long, so my husband went to the bar to order.  There the bartender walked by him several times, and again would not acknowledge him, much less take his order.  Keep in mind, he was not rushing to make drinks.  He was cleaning up.  I find it hard to believe we're invisible.  Maybe just undesirable?  Regardless, we left and went elsewhere.

Why do I have to love El Norteno so much? Why?  Why can't I find their red chile to be  anything but perfection...spicy red sauce so good I would eat it without meat, hot or cold, with our without a tortilla, with or without a utensil if need be.  If I left a burrito in my car in July and found it a week later, I would likely still eat it, and just suffer the consequences later.  The green chile is a close second, though.  Best to get both.  And a Mexican coke...they carry the big 16 oz bottles.  I did try the machaca, and while it was pretty good, I still wished it were actually dried meat.  But they do put the meat on the grill after cooking to dry it out a bit, so it's closer to the way I like it.  They make a great shredded beef taco, too.  Meat that's not overly seasoned and a freshly fried taco shell.  I guess you could get a soft taco, but really, what's the point?  I also got a plate last time, just to try the beans and rice.  Beans were good, but I could do without.  I do like that they don't put peas & carrots in their rice.  What is the point of that anyway?  It's not like you need to stretch rice because it is so expensive.  And is eating a tablespoon of vegetables going to undo the fact that I just consumed 9,000 calories?  But my biggest question is why does it have to be so damn far away?  Oh, I know.  Because if it was in Scottsdale, they would have to charge $11.99 for a burrito, and it would suck anyway.  I now find myself making a lot more donations to the Humane Society thrift store in Sunnyslope...just a quick drive down 7th Avenue on my way home.  Sort of.

Although I had no plans to eat here, the opportunity presented itself and my husband was getting hungry so I had only minutes before there was a possibility he would launch into d-bag mode.  OHW reminds me of Bun Huggers in Flagstaff both in decor and concept, where you wait in line to order off the overhead menu, burgers are cooked to order, and you help yourself to the topping bar.  Only here, the green chiles are fresh.  + 100 stars for that!  Burger and rings were great, but the fries were nothing special.  Several sized burgers are offered (in addition to chicken and fish) which is great for me because the one thing I can't eat in vast quantities is ground beef, so the small is the perfect size.  The topping bar was reasonably clean, they were busy, but the produce looked fresh.  They even have the coke dispenser with the computer interface, as well as the standard fountain.  While in theory it should shorten the drink lines, not so much when there's a child in front of you or a 40+-year old who needs instruction on how to work it.  Screw you dude behind me waiting impatiently while I read the instructions!

I had been wanting to try Mi Patio for a long time.  But since it's all the way "in the avenues" as my husband says, it's taken awhile.  I have to say I was almost a little disappointed upon arriving to find that it is a fairly nice restaurant, not the hole-in-wall, don't look under the table, in the window sills, and especially the kitchen, kind of place that we all know have the BEST food.  And with a nicer store front usually comes a higher price tag.  Mi Patio is no different.  Combination plates are in the $10 range.  Kind of expensive for Mexican food in my opinion.  Perhaps I'm still living in 1978.  In spite of that, we were seated and introduced to their chips and salsa.  The chips, unfortunately, were cold.  Had they been hot, they would have been the thin and crispy tortilla chips I love.  But the salsa was really really really good.  Because my husband and I have vowed to eat less in 2010, we shared a meal, an appetizer in fact.  Unfortunately, it was the $17 appetizer supreme that would have fed half of Mexico.  A pizza-sized platter filled with mini chimis, flautas, red chile nachos, and gyro slices (I thought that was odd, but my husband loved them).  We had wonderful service with two people making sure our drinks were kept filled.  The sampler had enough variety for me to learn I will happily make the trek back to "the avenues" for Mi Patio again.

The first time I went to Mesa Arts Center was one of the first times I had been to Mesa in many years, and I was skeptical.  As we drove down "Country Club" passing Beer World, The Pawn Man, and a check cashing business on every corner, I didn't expect much.  But as we got to Main Street, things started looking up.  And then we arrived....completely unexpectedly, this gorgeous modern building emerges.    First off, this place is huge.  With several art galleries and beautifully landscaped grounds, Mesa Arts Center hosts performances ranging from music, theater, and dance to comedy and National Geographic Live.  We've since returned for the Nat Geo series several times and never cease to be impressed by the architecture, the acoustics, and the staff.  On one visit, we had vouchers to exchange for "whatever is left" seats and were given seats so good, we try to request them now.  And I love that the parking garage is steps away and only $5!

Awe your non-Arizonan family and friends with this 90-minute tour of Saguaro Lake where they will see there is actually water in the desert, even if we put it there!!  For $20 (adult ticket price), this is a great way to show off our state without a road trip.  Part of the tour is through canyons, part of it is open desert.  You may also catch a glimpse of our local wildlife.  We spotted bald eagles soaring overhead, but bighorn sheep, bobcats, and even mountain lions have also been seen (or so we were told).  Although I've lived in Arizona my entire life (my very short life), I really enjoyed the tour as well.  The Captain provided plenty of information regarding the area and the state, but did not talk non-stop, so there was plenty of time to take in the scenery.  I even learned a thing or two.    The boat has two levels, the bottom being enclosed and air-conditioned.  The top is open, but shaded.  There are bathrooms on board and drinks available for purchase.  It is also available for private  charter, and they are sometimes special events, open to the public, held on board as well.  Get to the dock early if you want your choice of seating, as it is not assigned.  We thought 15 minutes would be plenty of time, but found they let people board early to get out of the 74 degree blistering sun.  And don't forget your camera!

I am going to have to drop my mom from speed dial and make room for Dodge.  These guys have been out 3 times in 2 weeks...not because they did a bad job but because we keep adding work.  We have had problems with power sags and surges for months.  Calls to a few of our neighbors confirmed we were not alone.  Two weeks ago, we had a surge so bad, we lost power in several areas of the house.  Flipping the breakers back on sounded like bacon frying.  Jim came to the rescue on short notice and determined the sizzling was dirt and there was technically nothing wrong with the breakers, and he was not even going to charge us for the call.  When we told him about the problems we had been having, he suggested we change our "mini" breakers out for full-size models.  Done.  Ed came out a few hours later.  Next day we notice the surge had blown out the electrical on the dryer.  Oh, there was the added bonus that whenever our neighbors fired up their jackhammer, our lights dimmed.  We decided to have Dodge put in a whole-house surge protector thanks to SRP.  While Jim was here, he tested the voltage and determined the spikes and drops were ridiculous.  He called SRP himself.  Now when we called, they didn't seem particularly interested, but when Jim called, two SRP trucks show up within 30 minutes.  It took all of 2 minutes for them to determine the neutral was so bad that they immediately cut power and started digging.  Visit 3 was earlier this week.  Our landscaper had noticed there was no power to the irrigation system.  Apparently my husband knew there was a problem with the GFCI outlet but "forgot" about it.  He did try to fix it, but the wiring was such a fiasco he gave up.  And out comes Jim again.  He mentioned he's actually a contractor by trade.  Perhaps, he should build himself a house next door.  I could keep him busy for years.  Good honest, reliable company.  Will be my go-to electrician from now on!

Had I written this review before the remodel, it would have been an easy 4 stars.  Since the remodel, it's been a debacle.    First, the double drive through may be good for traffic control in this shopping center, but having both lines merge to one window is not always easily managed.  I've been to the window and been offered the wrong order, only to be given the right order, which turned out to be the wrong order anyway.  There is a difference between egg McMuffins and sausage McMuffins.  That difference is 70 calories and 10 grams of fat.  If they do that to me 50 times, I will gain an extra pound.  And speaking of food, it's crappy half the time now.  Chicken is dry and chewy...except last time when I was asked to pull around and wait in front.  So much for drive thru.  Had great chicken that day.  Too bad they bagged the fries upon ordering, so they were cold by the time the chicken cooked.  And the fries often have that cold, old grease been sittin' way too long texture.  And the employees?  They must have had 100% staff change upon reopening:  "May I take your order?" "Yes, I would like a 5-piece chicken strip order, a southern style chicken sandwich, a large order of fries, a small Coke, and a large Iced tea." "So that's a large iced tea, and what else?"  Repeat, Every Single Time.

This place has pissed me off for the last time.  Well, probably not the last time, but it should be.  I've not been a regular because the food is so incredibly awesome, it's just okay.  I've been a regular because of the location and the reliably good service.  That seemed to all change once smoking was banned in the bar.    They are now eager to sit you in the bar as much as they can, especially if you come during a slow period.  I don't have a problem with that except the service really sucks in the bar.  We've given them several chances, and it's always the same.  Last night after braving the flood waters, we left before we ever saw drinks as the only server in the area was too busy chatting it up at the bar to ever come over.  But on a positive note, the hostess who seated us thanked us for coming in.  She's an observant one.

I just had some of the best pancakes ever at Orange Table!  The jalapeno pecan pancakes are perfection!  Unfortunately, the service is far from perfection.  In skimming the reviews, there seems to be a common theme with service issues; however, it seems like there are an awful lot of excuses made for the poor service.  Call me crazy, but perhaps if the staff is too hungover to work or too hip to manage a smile, the service industry is not their calling...unless they work here I guess.  When we walked in, there were a couple empty tables, but no one was interested in even acknowledging us.  I finally interrupted the server at the counter to ask if we were to seat ourselves.  Without looking up all we got was "no, there's a wait."  At least another 5 minutes went by before she could be bothered to get our name.  Those who came in after us were met by other servers with the same attitude.    The server who took eventually took our name ended up waiting on us as well.  She became slightly more pleasant, but the wait for everything was ridiculous.   At the point our food arrived, we still had no utensils.  My husband had planned to get coffee before we left, but we got the check abruptly.  The only thing without a wait.  So for those of you who want to hang out a couple hours for breakfast, the Orange Table may be your dream restaurant.  I would just suggest bringing your own drinks...and maybe a fork, so as to not unduly burden the servers.  I, on the other hand, will be making my own jalapeno pecan pancakes.  Thanks for the idea Orange Table!

After hearing Orange Table had gotten their service issues corrected, I had to judge for myself.  It's TRUE!!!!!!!!  Things were a little slow in the beginning, so I was worried.  But once our server did make it to us, things were pretty good.  Food did not take nearly as long as it used to, and wait for this....................................................................................... our server was PLEASANT!  I know, like night and day.  Welcome back to my life OT!

I stumbled across this little shop in Old Town several months ago, and it has now become my favorite stop for gelato.  If you've never had gelato, it's Italian ice cream, with less air whipped into it and less cream than American ice cream.  The less cream part makes for a lower fat product (yeah!!), but you would never know it.  It is actually more dense and creamy than ice cream.  Where too soft ice cream seems to just drip and melt in a puddle, gelato gets a little gooey almost.    The shop is nothing fancy, but has superior gelato.   While there are some of the typical flavors you find in ice cream, there are many more interesting flavors like spumoni, tiramisu, green tea, limoncello and poppyseed, fresh ginger, and creme brulee to name only a few!  The shop also has a great selection of sorbetto (sorbet).  Try the blackberry cabernet for something unique.   There is also a sandwich menu and Italian coffee served, although I've never had reason to buy a sandwich.  I'm there for the gelato baby!  This shop is on the edge of the shopping in Old Town so parking is usually not a problem either.  If you've never had gelato, try it at least once.  I'm pretty sure you'll be back.

Well just when I was about to take off a star or two for being unexpectedly closed what seems like every time I have tried to go lately, they were open today.  Still love their gelato over the other guys, especially the spumoni!

I can't think of anything I would rather do than eat out--sorry husband, I'm an eater, not a lover.  Thus, I was deeply saddened that we made the mistake of choosing to eat here after running an errand at the mall.  We arrived during linner (in between lunch and dinner) so not very busy at all.  Yet, it was still 10 minutes to even get our drink order taken.  Just as we were about to leave, our sorry excuse for a server shows up.  We were very curt, not rude, with her so she must have got the point.  She now overcompensates by trying to be our BFF.  It's clear where she was at during our arrival--running her mouth to anyone who would listen.  My husband ordered a dragon roll (he said it was just okay) and she proceeds to quiz him about why he likes it because she's never tried it, and further explains she has always wanted to ask her customers that but is usually too busy.  Now the dumb ass had admitted she's not busy.  He also orders miso soup as an appetizer.  Less than five minutes into the dragon roll, his entree arrives.  No soup.  The server comes by and asks "did you ever get your soup?"  Yes, he ate it and the empty bowl it was so good.  She generously took the non-existent soup off our bill-no apology.  I had the macadamia nut chicken, and the server made sure to tell me what a good choice I made because that is their signature dish.  For a signature dish, it was just okay.  Chicken done nicely, but could have used a little more of the chutney.  My husband had the seared ahi (which was a little more than seared, slightly overcooked) with a sweet chili sauce that looked like either a blind person plated it or the server tripped because sauce was spilled over one side of the plate.  Server again disappeared in between my husband's plate being removed and my finishing.  I suggested we tip $4.19 so she can buy a gallon of gas to look for a new job, but we opted on a 10% tip as we have had worse.  Unlikely I will return however.

I love Swarovski and their stores.  Everything is so pretty and sparkly!    This store carries a nice selection of jewelry, accessories, and gift items in all price ranges.  I am a little disappointed they don't use any solid gold in their jewelry, only gold plated.  Every sales girl I have dealt with has been friendly and helpful, although the gal I spoke with today did come across as a little pushy.    This store has become one of my go-to places when I'm stuck on a gift.  But word of warning to the men...crystals are no substitute for diamonds!!!

Those of you who know me can appreciate I like to live on the edge (insert sarcasm font).  So when Dottsy Z dared us ladies to join her at Billet, how could I say no.  I dressed in my biker duds of a black top and patent leather boots and dug out my smallest, most inconspicuous Coach bag and headed out.  My husband was clearly worried about this adventure as evidenced by the fact he had disappeared prior to my leaving, never bothering to call.  Well it turned out we were a little short on ladies...and on bikers.  So in in full disclosure, I missed out on the full Billet experience.  But I did find a nice, laid back atmosphere, cheap drinks, and a friendly bartender.  Part of the bar is outside which would have been great had the weather been just a little warmer.  Although Billet does not have a kitchen, they've got menus from RA Sushi Bar and David's Hamburgers.  Not only will they place your order and have it delivered, they'll add the meal to your tab!  A pretty nice place overall!

Am I the only one who has driven by here wondering what in the hell this place is?  And are their date shakes really "world famous."  Well, you'll all be glad to know I finally have the answers.  Rest assured it is not a house of ill-repute, nor a ranch.  And the shakes are world famous...if you live in my world anyway.  In my younger years, I was not a fan of the date, the fruit that is.  Remember the ones that grew in a box?  With the dry skin and squishy inside, you really couldn't tell the difference between it and a cockroach.  Much like prunes, they grow on you as you get older.    So after driving by Sphinx a zillion times to go to Dairy Queen, my husband and I finally made the effort to stop.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Their Medjools (which come from Yuma BTW) are perfect, even better dipped in chocolate.  And they taste nothing like the crappy boxed ones from yesteryear.  The Ranch also has a variety of dried fruits, nuts, jams, candy, honey, etc, selling products from Arizona when possible.  Gift packages are available and they will ship.  I will definitely be making some Christmas purchases here.  And the lady working was sooo nice.  She seemed thrilled to make us a shake.  But then again, she had just gotten off the phone trying to convince her insurance company she was not dead, so maybe she had a new lease on life.  As for the shakes, if you've never had one.  You must try it.  I decided the small looked...well, small.  So I had a medium.  Really I shouldn't have.  It was so rich and sweet, my husband never saw dinner that night.  Although he wasn't complaining with his plethera of goodies we purchased.  Summer hours are Mon-Sat until 3 pm.

I am not a "natural and organic" type of girl, but I love this little market.  They seriously do have "silly prices" as their slogan goes.  I still shop at the supermarkets for household goods, junk food, and other staples.  Where Sunflower has me hooked is their bakery-bread in particular.  I love bread, but have never been a sandwich eater because I'm not a white, wheat, or rye fan.  Sunflower has a huge selection of unique breads (kalamata olive, rosemary and olive oil, asiago cheese, jalapeno & cheddar, my favorite cranberry & walnut, to name only a few!).  They'll even slice it for you if you ask.  They also have a great frozen fruit & veggie section with options not always available in your average supermarket (sweet potato fries, baby asparagus, and mango for example).  Their meat department is great, too, and soooo much cheaper than you pay at a supermarket.  The only complaint I have is that the produce is not always the best in my opinion.  On more than one occasion,  I had to stop at Fry's across the street because what I needed didn't look so good.  I also can't seem to get a decent lime-they're always dry.  Maybe it's just me??

I took my mom and my aunts to afternoon tea service recently.  Served in the lobby tea court, we were seated near the hotel entrance.  I wished I had thought to request a nice window seat when making the reservation, but it was still a lovely setting.  The pianist was a nice touch as well.  For $36 per person, the tea includes a variety of finger sandwiches, scones, and desserts...oh, and tea.  There is also an option for champagne ($45?), but we declined.  And let's face it, an afternoon with relatives is more likely to require bourbon, rather than champagne.  Just kidding mom (she may be trolling my reviews).  There's a nice tea selection, and everyone gets their own pot (of tea that is).  Also, rather than the tiered trays, your server will offer you each course.  First up were the tea sandwiches (chicken salad, egg salad, smoked salmon, English cucumber, and asparagus with garlic herb mousse).  Surprisingly, my favorite was the asparagus.  Not surprisingly my least favorite was the cucumber.  Cucumber + white bread = bland in my book.  BTW, in case you think afternoon tea should be a full, gut-exploding meal, you can have as many as you want.  Second course were scones-plain and cranberry-served with the expected lemon curd, strawberry jam, and cream.  And if that's not sweet enough for you, the final course is a variety of mini desserts.  By then, even I could not manage to sample one of everything, but I tried.  My only criticism is that a few things were not quite as polished as I would have expected.  The server spilled some of the tea as she was setting one of the pots down (certainly understandable and forgivable), and my aunt's teacup was not quite clean (not as excusable) and she had to request another.    But overall, a very nice afternoon.  And since it was my mom's birthday, they brought her an assortment of cookies to take home and the pianist played Happy Birthday (several times in fact, so I'm not quite sure who it was for).

Went for the first time last night to the 10 pm open mic show.  Great time for only $10 plus 2 drinks.  The space is quite small and intimate-a big plus.  I did find the drink service to be dreadfully slow upon arriving, but it picked up once the show started.  Not sure if this is the norm, but there were only two servers for the room.  They did a great job considering.  The guys at the door and assisting with seating were super courteous and professional as well.  No tables for two so bring friends as ALL seats will be filled.  Only real drawback was the line of people waiting for the doors to open since it's first come seating even if prepaid.  The earlier show ran late which added to the wait.  In spite of that, I will definitely return since I live in the area.  Thanks Thomas S!

Consider this review a public service announcement.  I usually don't review fast food restaurants, but this one is a stand out.  And trust me, you should stand outside, far far away.  Don't even think about going in.  Having lived in the area for 3 years and married to a KFÇ cole slaw fanatic, we've had cause to come here a handful of times.  First time, not so good.  Second time, not so good.  Every time since, not so good.    If we're lucky, the only problem is our order is screwed up.  Most likely it's screwed up and bad food.  Chicken strips are like shoe leather, potato wedges are chewy, tender roast should be called dry roast, and original recipe chicken must be mistaken for the original chicken.  All in all, it saddens me a chicken had to die for this.  So I walk away with two lessons learned.  One-this place NEVER gets any better, and two-my husband and I are not good with lessons.

Masterfully created artisan ice creams made in small batches from only the freshest, local ingredients...you won't find that at Sugar Bowl.  If that's what you're looking for, head to Sweet Republic.  Those gals are the masters of ice cream.  But sometimes I want a simple sundae...or a Spectacular Banana Bowl in my case (chocolate ice cream with marshmallow topping, vanilla with strawberry, and cookies & cream with chocolate syrup) made with perfectly good ice cream, and all that for only $7.50.  That's when you'll find me in my own neighborhood at Sugar Bowl.  Stopping in last weekend, their power was out, but since it wasn't too warm outside, we stayed anyway.  And guess what?  The lack of an air conditioner running in the background and no fluorescent lighting was kind of appropriate for this little old school ice cream parlor.  It reminded me of a time when ice cream was just ice cream.  No vegetables or pork products involved.  No liqueurs (unless your dad was drinking a beer while you ate your sundae).  No over analyzing the texture, sweetness, creaminess.  Just ice cream.  Of course there's not a scoop for a dime to be found either, but a scoop for $1.95 is on the menu.  I also found it entertaining while my husband ran across the street to the ATM, that someone finally found the credit card imprinter, and depressing that the cashier did not know what it was or how to use it.  Times have changed.

Decided to go for Round 2 for a light dinner this time.  I found the food and service to be superior to our last experience.  The husband and I shared the mini mushroom pan fry, and I see why it is their signature dish.  It was so good that I will not be sharing next time.  We also had the dungeness crab stack.  This is pricey ($20) for a small plate, but it was fabulous.  We had the cuppa' red hot chocolate to finish.  It was a to-die-for dessert.  A chocolate pot de creme (custard) with chipotle crema and a chocolate chipotle cookie.  Spicy, rich, decadent, all good things.  Our server was excellent from start to finish.  This time I am confident we will return, just maybe not at lunch.

All you chocolate elitists can turn your noses up at See's all you want.  I love it, and I always will.  See's was the "special" candy my family tried to order every Christmas.  Back in those days before the internet (we still had 8-track tape players) at a time when no one really knew anything existed other than what you had seen, there was Russell Stover, Whitman's Samplers (that my cheap ass uncle was fond of giving in lieu of a real present), and See's.  There was no comparison.  See's was it.  I didn't even know they had stores then, much less stores that give out free candy just for coming in.  Kind of like a test drive without the pressure.  And I still prefer See's over it's closest competitor to me, location-wise, Godiva.  Why?  Well, the free candy for one.  Number two, it doesn't cost $60 a pound, more like $16.  Granted, Godiva has prettier packaging and perhaps a better product, but not enough to compromise my loyalty.    I was recently saddened to see the store at Fashion Square close, but luckily, this one is nearby.  Much larger and easier to shop in, but my only complaint is that I had to stand in line with people hand-picking their boxes to pay for my pre-packaged items.  But since my husband was one of the pickers, I wasn't going anywhere until he was done anyway.  And his box was for me:)

When I first moved here, this was the lab I used, until I just couldn't take it anymore.  I could never find a time to go when it wasn't a minimum 45-minute wait...on a good day.  Though the waiting room is large, it's often standing room only.  And waiting outside in July is not exactly a nice alternative.    I tried going first thing in the morning, it was packed with everyone who was fasting (including me).  Tried waiting until late morning.  Same.  Tried going early afternoon.  Same.  Only now I'm really hungry, and really pissed off.  And while you're sitting for that hour waiting, look to your left. This seems to be a preferred lab for all the AHCCCS gals with two in tow and one on the way.  Now look to your right.  See all those elderly folks in wheelchairs carting oxygen tanks.  You'll be lucky to have oxygen when you're their age or a wheelchair for that matter.  Look back to your left.  That's the generation that will be funding my social security someday.  The check-in process seems overly complicated.  I had my labs sent to the wrong doctor once because rather than sending them to the physician that ordered them, they went to the last doctor I saw.  I updated my address, but they sent my bill to my old address anyway.  Now, if you can find a reasonable time to go, the techs are really good here.  Fast, friendly, and they won't miss your vein no matter how small it is.  And I have much compassion for the work they do.  At my last and final visit, the tech told me "don't take this the wrong way, but you smell so good, what are you wearing?"  Soap.  That's how bad this guy's morning was going.  Soap was a refreshing change.

Great office.  Dr. Kessler does a very thorough exam, and I've never had a problem with my prescription.  I always purchase my glasses here, and all the girls are very helpful in finding me a pair that work for my "not made for glasses" head.  However, if you're one who wants to do it on your own, like my husband, they're respectful of that as well.  Frames are more expensive than the big box optical shops, but definitely a higher quality.  Or maybe it's just me that gravitates toward the more expensive ones.  Either way, I highly recommend this office.

I can only review based on the experience of trying to sell a gold watch.  Although they do buy jewelry, it's clear they would prefer to consign it.  My mother was urged by a salesperson several times to go this route even though she was clear the first time that she was not interested in consignment.    Also, instead of making her an offer, the jeweler asked what she wanted for it.  I don't know if it was their intention, but it came across to me as an opportunity to take advantage of a customer that may not know the market value of a piece well enough to ask for a fair price.  My mom did ask for slightly more than the offer she had just received, but the jeweler's response was only "I can't do that."  No counter offer.  If they weren't interested in buying the piece (although the salesperson did remark they had sold a similar watch recently), I would have preferred the jeweler be up front about it rather than wait to see if he could get it for nothing.  In addition to jewelry, I did also notice they have quite a bit of blown glass art in the store as well.

So it's a chain.  I like it.  Who is making up these unwritten rules that we can't dine at, write about, or enjoy a chain restaurant anyway?  I actually come here primarily when my mom is visiting because she likes it.  So do a few of my Flagstaff friends.  I've found the food is always prepared well, the service is always great, and the prices are reasonable including drink prices.  Oh and now they have these cute little dessert minis for $2.00 each.  I didn't indulge since we had a birthday cake at home, but for $2, I can try everything that looks good!

Had our service been anything better than pathetically bad, Buca would be a solid 3 stars.  So here's the deal on the service.  I got a coupon in the mail for a free spaghetti with marinara.  That's what brought us in.  But we also ordered two appetizers and an entree to start with.  I commented that I thought the coupon was a nice idea to bring people in (give away a little spaghetti but sell twice that in other menu items).  His response was "yeah, if people are like you and order other stuff, but if they just order spaghetti and water... (insert monotone robotic voice)."  Well, okay then, he should be grateful we didn't do that.  Everything we ordered was terribly slow to come.  Kitchen's fault?  Maybe, but we notice where the other servers on the patio are coming and going, our server is rarely seen and when he is around, he's dragging his feet appearing to be on his way to the gas chamber.  Other than taking and delivering our order, he did nothing for us.  While not rude, he was not pleasant or overly friendly either.  The other guys on the patio helped us out with drink refills, clearing plates, etc.  After a long wait at the end of the meal, he returned remarking someone else was supposed to be helping.  We ordered dessert to go, another terrible wait, and asked our food be boxed.  Finally, he brings the dessert and realizes he never brought the leftovers.  Off he shuffles.  Upon returning, he says he's sorry about the wait.  Not half as sorry as he would be upon seeing his tip I'm sure.  As for the food, it's good, but nothing outstanding.  Even for family style plates, I think it's slightly overpriced.  When they say a small serves 2-3, that's 2-3 lunch sized portions.  If you're a "healthy" eater, count on 2.  Here's what we ordered:  Small garlic bread.  Really good bread slathered in fresh garlic, but $7.99.  Yes, it's a good sized basket, but it's still just garlic bread.  Perhaps bread should be offered at no charge.    Small mozzarella caprese.  Five nice thick slices of tomato with good quality cheese and whole basil leaves.  $9.99 but worth it.  Small spaghetti with marinara, normally $9.99 but free.  I would say this serves two for a main dish, three as a side.  Marinara was okay, nothing special.  Small chicken parmigiana.  Tasty but overpriced at $17.99 for two breasts IMO.  Remember it does not come with any pasta, just the chicken.  Tiramisu.  Best value at $9.95.  It's the size of a small pie and could easily serve four, but I didn't think it was fantastic.  It's a little too "wet," like you could squeeze the cake and get a cup of coffee out of it.  We wanted to have a after-lunch drink, but the service turned us off to that.  Might come back, might not.

Okay, I could probably live without Asian food.  I like Chinese and Thai on occasion, especially if it's cold out.  The rest of it I wouldn't miss.  Sorry, Mexico is my true love.  But I have to say, I love Tottie's, if for no other reason than the Green Curry.  It is easily one of my favorite dishes right now.  I've tried both the lemon and tangerine chicken (apparently I could not live without citrus), and while good, they cannot compete with the green curry.  Generally I would prefer Chinese to Thai, or so I thought.  I know, it's like comparing apples to oranges.  I also really like the Tottie rolls.  The spring rolls taught me I'm not a fan of rice paper, but I loved the peanut sauce.  Anything dipped in that peanut sauce would be good!  Given its location,  I was pleasantly surprised that Tottie's is actually quite nice inside, although we usually get take-out.  In fact, today is quite chilly.  I think that curry is calling me.

Really good!  Awesome patio and great bar area.  Everything I have ever tried has been hot though, even the chips are spicy.  It's not so bad that your tongue swells and you can't see straight.  You can still taste and enjoy the food.    I always find service to be hit and miss.  Never terribly bad, but usually just average.  Last night, we did have terrific service.  I tried the filet tacos for an appetizer-OMG!  They were sooo good.  Pricey, but well worth it.  Next time, that's my dinner.  My only complaint is the dining room is quite small and not necessarily any quieter than the bar.  If they try to seat you on a busy night near the pick up window, wait for another table.  Also, if you go around happy hour, expect overflow from the bar into the dining room which can make for a less than peaceful experience.  I just try to remember that in my working days there were plenty of times my own loudmouth group of friends were even worse.  I forgot to mention chips are not free-totally lame, yet I buy them every time.

Sat on the patio last night-heat lamp ON of course.  Really lovely, and the waterfalls drown out the sound of traffic on Hayden.  I wanted Sangria but didn't see it on the menu.  Not only did they have it, it is probably some of the best I've had.  If you've never tried Carlsbad, now is the time to enjoy the patio with that glass of Sangria.

My husband and I have been to Carlsbad many times, and I'm always happy.  The spice level is still really inconsistent though.  If I ever order green chile stew again, I will ask for a sample first.  The last time it was so hot, I could not eat it.  Do you realize how hot something has to be for me to waste it?    But we did recently go for Sunday brunch for the first time, and it was good!  I had eggs benedict with jalapeño hollandaise.  The eggs were properly poached and the hollandaise was spicy, but not too much so.  As a side note, whoever was in charge of those potatoes had an accident with the salt shaker.  Waaayyy too salty.  Oh, and most importantly, they have bloody mary's for $3.25.  Yes, $3.25.  Mimosas, too.  I know the current trend is bottomless, but I usually only order one or two anyway, or my whole day is shot because I'm stuck on the sofa in a drunken, overstuffed stupor.  Beautiful patio weather right now, too!

So I was out looking for a Mom's Day gift and wound up here.  They have a really nice selection of diamonds and gemstones.  Overall, it's quite a bit nicer, and more expensive, than the nearby Kay Jewelers but not crazy like Cartier.  Not that I wouldn't love a Cartier piece...Ryan, are you listening, can you hear me?  The service was excellent.  The sales people are personable and knowledgeable, and more than willing to show you as much as you would like without attitude.

Tried this place for the first time on a recommendation.  I had little hope of a pleasant experience as the hostLESS, who looked straight at me as I walked in, was too busy conversing with another employee to even acknowledge our arrival, much less seat us promptly.  However, once her involvement was out of the way, I was very much impressed.  The restaurant is a little on the noisy side, but not enough to be distracting.  The lighting is nice, too.  The service was excellent from the time we sat down until our check was paid.   Both the waiter and his support staff were attentive without being intrusive.  The wine list is more than sufficient.  I was surprised to see a Barbera offered, one of my favorite reds.  The menu is large with numerous pasta, chicken, beef, veal and seafood selections.  We had the steamed mussels and clams as an appetizer (the menu states "mussels or clams" but we asked for a mix) which was excellent.  Plenty large enough for two, if not three.  I had a chicken dish with tomatoes, garlic, and mushrooms in a wine sauce (are you hungry yet?) which was served with both pasta and a vegetable, resulting in a nice lunch the next day.  I'm all about large portions-never was the type to order a salad on the first date.  My husband had baked ziti which he enjoyed as well.  My favorite part..we skipped dessert, also a rarity for me, but still received two small cookies with our check.  How cool is that?  My second stomach reserved for D'Zert was not disappointed after all!

Much as I hated to leave my mechanic in Flagstaff, it's not really prudent to  make the drive if your car is broken and finding a new shop was inevitable.   My husband and I took a shot in the dark and tried Marshall's after noticing their small lot was always crammed with cars.    He had a problem with a water pump that damaged some other stuff, and the bill was pricey like all repair shops, but they didn't try to sell other services (he drives a 1995 SUV, I'm sure they could have come up with something else wrong).  I just took my vehicle in for a 60K check.  The gentleman who helped me was super nice, and called me with a complete list of their findings.  He itemized what their recommendations were in the routine check and the cost.  He then separately went over a couple other possible repairs (master cylinder leak and rear shock leak).  However, he was very up front that these were not safety issues and did not have to be done immediately.  Instead, he advised me what to look for when the repairs were more pressing.  There was a discrepancy between their maintenance schedule and my owner's manual with respect to spark plugs.  When I questioned it, he checked the owner's manual himself and agreed that earlier tune-ups were recommended in "severe" driving conditions, but as the vehicle is running smoothly, I could easily put the tune-up off, and might opt to prioritize the master cylinder repair.  I can't say speak for the quality of their work yet because "it ain't broke," but I do give this garage high marks for not resorting to scare tactics to make a buck (or thousand).

I scheduled my vehicle for shocks.  Somehow I ended up with an oil change instead.  Ted apologized profusely, gave me a lift home, and called back within an hour to say their mechanic would stay late to get the correct repair done tonight so that I could pick up the vehicle first thing in the morning.  He also let me in on the special of "buy shocks, get free oil change."  I'm actually raising my rating by a star in spite of the mistake based on how it was handled.  Too bad they didn't accidentally change the spark plugs.  I could have used that error.

This whole review saddens me.  I was this shop's biggest fan.  My last experience with the front man was disappointing, but what I would discover later warrants a warning to everyone else.  I took the car in because unlike every other vehicle on the planet, my A/C was losing temp while moving, but getting cold again while idling.  I also asked for an oil change and a complete inspection.  Usually, either Patrick or Joe have coordinated with me.  This time it was Matt.  He called pretty quickly and advised my compressor was completely shot, but that did not explain the cooling issues.  As this compressor had only 10,000 miles on it, I explained I really needed to know what else could be causing the problem so I would know what I might be in for. Matt told me he couldn't make a guess and they could not diagnose the problem without replacing the compressor first.  He also advised I needed a new water pump belt and that the oil pan was leaking.  At this point, I opted to discuss it with my father first, my resident car expert.  When I spoke with Matt again, I asked if they had let the A/C run for a period while idling.  I got "I assume so" as an answer.  I also asked if they could just tighten the gaskets on the oil pan.  After a sarcastic response, he said the bottom of the pan was covered in oil, but it could wait.  In the past, I was provided that kind of info from the get go.   I also asked for a new compressor, not a rebuild.  I was discouraged and told a new part would probably only be available from the dealer at a substantial increase in cost.  I got the impression he just didn't want to look for the part, but he did agree to get a quote and speak with the technician.    Later Matt left a message that they had run more tests, and now they can say with certainty the compressor is the only problem.  So now I'm pretty disgusted by the fact that first he tells me they can't know if an $800 repair will fix the problem until I hesitate to get the repair, and now suddenly more tests materialize that allow them to properly diagnose it??  At this point, I still had chalked this up as poor communication from Matt, but I washed my hands of it letting my husband take over.  He opted to pick up the car with nothing but the oil change done.  This is where it goes from bad to worse.  My dad can get parts for less than half of retail, so we opted to have him buy the parts and his guy do the repairs. The new compressor was not difficult to find and did not have to come from the dealer.  Furthermore, my dad looks at everything before taking it in.  First thing he didn't find was an oil pan leak.  The oil on the pan was the oil blowing from the leaky compressor.  The gaskets were clean-not wiped clean, clean as in never been leaking.  His mechanic also confirmed there was no leak.  Second, brake fluid was low so apparently there was no fluid check with the oil change.  Third, oil drain plug was loose-loose enough to be tightened by hand.  Fourth, oil level is low!  It didn't appear to have all leaked out, but rather I was shorted on oil.    I am not certain whether there has been a change in mechanics or what is going on.  But it was really disheartening to be advised to do a $280 repair for a non-existent leak.  That's either dishonesty or an epic fail in diagnostic ability.  Not to mention a simple oil change was not done correctly either...again I don't know if that was intentional because we opted to pick the car up or the work of sloppy technicians.  Regardless, I just don't feel I can trust Marshall's anymore.

Tiny little (I guess that's redundant) bar and grill that seems to have a regular following and serves simple, yet tasty food at a decent price.  Stopped in late one night.  Well maybe it was 9 or so, but that's late for me.  I went with the turkey philly spike style (jalapeño and green chiles) and potato salad.  The potato salad (house-made) was pretty good, and I'm extremely hard to please with that.  The philly was better than I expected considering it was smoked turkey and not ribeye, and the jalapeño and chiles definitely made it better!  I can't remember the name of the guy working that evening, but he was awesome.  Even though he was tasked with both tending bar and waiting tables, actually one table, he was on top of things and made us feel like regulars.  In fact, I'm wondering now why I haven't been back.  Will have to rectify that soon!

Hot waiters they say.  Most of them must be off on Sunday night, although we did see an old dude walking around in a tie-I assume he was the manager-that or  I've got a seriously different definition of hot than the average girl.  This was our first time here, and we were not disappointed.  We had an appetizer of roasted red peppers, tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and prosciutto.  Perfect with the warm rolls they serve.  My husband and I both had pasta dishes-mine was good ole' spaghetti and meatballs, and those balls were big!  We're talking about the food now, not the waiters, so keep up.  My husband had linguine with crab meat.  We both thought our dishes were excellent as well as the tiramisu we shared.  Service was excellent.  I like how they brought a board out with all the specials on it and left it at the table to check out, rather than rattling off the options, most of which you will forget by the time they're done reciting them.  I knock a star off as I thought the pasta dishes were overpriced.  $14 for the spaghetti and $23 for the linguine with crab-it wasn't like there was a pound of crab meat in it!  But overall, a great meal.  We'll definitely come again.

I don't think I can say much about a dry cleaner to keep you glued to this review, but I will say I have had no problems in the 2 years I've used them.  No little tags that say "we tried and tried..but your garment still looks like crap."  The prices are reasonable, and a few of the girls even remember my name even though I'm not in all that often.  Nice touch.

Wow!  I've lived in Old Town for two years and have never come here before now.  What is wrong with me!!  Fantastic pizza.  At first, I didn't think I would like it as they only serve thin crust.  But the crust is not cracker thin.  It has the chewy doughiness I love with a little pinch of saltiness.  Great selection of toppings.  We had sweet red peppers, basil, garlic, ricotta, and pepperoni (did you know it doesn't have to come in paper thin slices that dry all up?).  A small pizza was enough for my husband and I to share.  Tiramisu was excellent.  You can also watch the coal-fired ovens and hope every pizza that goes in or comes out is yours.  The menu consists only of pizza, calzone, salads, and dessert.  It's also on the expensive side when you load up on toppings.  A small pie, small caprese salad, one glass of wine, and one dessert came to $50.00 and WORTH EVERY PENNY!  Soooo good!

I still love Grimaldi's pizza, but some of their staff could definitely use an attitude check.  We last went during off hours, and the restaurant was relatively empty.  We were seated at a small 4-top in the middle of the room.  When we asked if we could sit at one of the empty tables by the window, the hostess told us no since we were a party of 4, and those tables were for 5.  Seriously?  All of the tables are empty.  We're talking one extra chair.  So of course when we ordered two pizzas and an appetizer, there was a space problem for the server.  As we were leaving, the hostess was advising another family they couldn't bring their stroller in because there wasn't enough space.  While that might hold true during busy times, there was plenty of space.  I can only assume this employee was working under management's policies.  Aside from that, I still think they have some of the best pizza around, although, we have gotten a soggy middle a few times since our first visit.

I had several pieces of jewelry that needed repair, and Yelp steered me this way.  I had a new set of earrings, and one had a post that didn't fasten securely.  They fixed that on the spot at no charge.  I was glad I opted against manhandling it with a pair of pliers.  The second piece was a bracelet that had a clasp that kept coming open.  That had to be left, but it was adjusted in-house.  The third piece was an earring with a broken post.  It turned out that had to be sent out for soldering because heat could damage the stones.    When they called to advise the earring would have to be sent out and the cost, I considered not having the work done.  When I dropped the pieces off, the lady who helped me looked at all the pieces and stated this earring was silver.  I had assumed it was white gold, but it was a gift.  I wasn't sure I wanted to spend the extra money to repair it.  When I told her my concerns about fixing the piece, she said she had misspoken, and the earring was actually gold, not silver.  That further slightly affected her estimate, but I decided it was worth it.    They did a beautiful job, and I could not tell which earring had the new post.  The only reason I dropped a star was the misidentification of the metal.  I'm not sure how they can visually tell the difference between the two, unless she was just looking for the 14K mark and missed it.  The jeweler, however, had identified it correctly.  I would not hesitate to have future repairs done.  And my husband is more than welcome to select any of their jewelry for purchase.  Oh, and they're right next door to See's Candies.  I should have given them 5 stars for that alone!

Went back to Grotto for the first time in many years.  I was a fan then, I still am.  The restaurant is loud.  It's crowded.  And the food is good.  We started with mussels portifino (a white wine and garlic broth).  I liked that the dish was available in two sizes, the small being perfect for an app for two.  A little more bread to soak up the broth would have been nice, though.  I also had a special of sea bass over ravioli topped with marinara.  I liked all the components except I never seem to learn I'm not so big on seafood with marinara.  The sea bass was a generous portion, and cooked perfectly, as was the ravioli.  I had a little bit of plate envy over my husband's halibut with a lemon butter sauce.  I had this dish the last time and loved it!  Service was average.  Our waiter was relatively attentive, but not really friendly.  He oddly never made eye contact (not sure if he was always looking at something/someone else or just weird) and he rattled off the specials way too quickly.   Certainly not bad enough to deter me from going again.  But someone remind me not to order seafood in red sauce!

I really like Bandera.  I really LOVE their cornbread.  Best dang cornbread I've ever had.  I dream about it in fact.  Food is always great, service is usually great as well.  Great place to take guests if you're not sure what they like.  My only complaint...Bandera is a fairly casual restaurant, yet last time I was there my father was asked to remove his cap.  No biggie, he willingly obliged, but then I noticed the staff didn't seem to have a problem with the cute little thing wearing hers at the next table.  Come on, be consistent guys.

I have to hand it to my husband.  I'm the Yelper, yet he managed to find a place for my birthday that I did not even have bookmarked.  As we pull into the strip mall, I'm thinking "Oregano's? Really?"  But it was Razz's!  And the Chef's Table (more like a counter) to boot!  Be prepared to get to know those next to you as seating is very tight though.    As many small plates you can handle (I handled 7, thank you) for $10 a pop.  One of my favorites was the seafood beggar's purse with a red chili sauce, but truthfully, I loved all but the last (I really never know when to quit).  Several of the dishes incorporated southwest flavors which is a huge plus for me, too.  And Razz was a delightful host assisting us with wine selections to complement the varied menu.  Would definitely do this again, but maybe with fewer courses.  By the time 7 rolled around, I was rolling around.

What kind of idiot thinks it's a good idea to keep a mountain lion in a central Phoenix apartment?  Well at least that cat was able to go for car rides and walks before being confiscated.  Unlike the tortured 12-pound bobcat that had been used for target practice that was found wandering with five feet of tow chain still around her neck.  Sadly, both of these animals will never live in the wild, but they have found a home with Southwest Wildlife.  This non-profit receives no state or federal funding, but with donations and volunteers, it has been able to take in thousands of wild animals that were either injured, orphaned, or confiscated.  Its primary mission is to provide the medical care necessary to rehabilitate these animals and return them to the wild if possible, and they do just that in the majority of cases.    But since some animals can never be released, SW Wildlife is an accredited sanctuary and can provide these animals with a permanent home.  It is also a holding facility for the Mexican Gray Wolf Recovery Program.  I had the opportunity to tour the facility and was pleased to find it clean and the animals appeared to be well-cared for.  Some are very social with their care-givers and come right up to the fencing for their treat.  But who wouldn't find a fresh mouse appetizing?  Five stars for sure.  Their enclosures certainly cannot compare to the area the animal would naturally inhabit in the wild, but they have a decent amount of space and are given enrichment items as well.  They all seemed relatively content.  We had the opportunity to see mountain lions, a bear, coyotes, bobcats, wolves, peccaries, and deer that day.    Tours are available by appointment and cost only $10.  Also, the address in the Yelp listing is the mailing address.  The physical location is in the McDowell Mountain area, strangely in a rural residential area.  A map is on the website.  Allow ample time to get there.  I allowed 30 minutes from south Scottsdale and was late. Dynamite Rd looks really close to Shea on the map.  Apparently it is not.  Luckily we found a volunteer to connect us with our tour as there is no office open to the public that I could see.  Best $20 spent in a long time, and I didn't even eat!

Still one of my favorite organizations!  I especially love their full moon tours, and hearing the wolves sing together with the coyotes as backup.  Sadly, at a recent donor event I learned that they have a new neighbor that apparently does not appreciate their song.  Although this person moved into the middle of the desert knowing SW Wildlife was nearby, he's apparently complained of the howling to the extent that they now have to close their doors to the public:(  To keep my review focused on SW Wildlife, I will refrain from launching into a colorful spiel about what I think of this person.  SW Wildlife will continue to do rescue and rehabilitation of our wildlife, its primary mission, and provide a sanctuary for those in need of a home.  They will also continue and perhaps expand their educational outreach offsite.  However, beginning in June, there will be no public tours offered any longer.  Special events have to now be permitted.  I don't think this is yet noted on their website, so perhaps they have hope.  They stand to lose 30% of their revenue because of this.  In the meantime, I highly highly recommend seeing this wonderful facility up close by scheduling a tour as soon as possible.  Only then will you appreciate their value to our community.

Dear Mr. Betos:  After finding an unidentifiable object in my guac that tasted suspiciously like a piece of rotting chicken judging from the millisecond it was in my mouth, you've given me a reason to look to your neighbor to the south for my grease fix.  Hello Fiesta Burrito.  We ordered our staples of rolled tacos and a carne asada burrito for comparison to Los Betos.  Both fine establishments have the ever-so-popular styrofoam tip jar taped outside the drive-thru window.  Fiesta Burrito is actually a little bit cheaper for the same items, if you can believe it.  While I would say Betos has better flour tortillas IMO, the food at Fiesta seemed just a little fresher, although equally as artery clogging.  So for now, I'm going to give the edge to Fiesta, and drive the extra 2 miles to try it again.  But don't worry Mr. Betos, I'll be back to see you too.  I have a big heart, and there's room enough for you both.

Never in my many visits to Fiesta Burrito...and there have been a lot of them...have I been disappointed.    Never has the food tasted like it was made a week ago.  Never have I had to spit anything out, hoping it had, at least, originated from the cow.  Never have I had cause, or been afraid to check the restaurant inspections naughty list.  I am a fan.

We came to look at 3 different vehicles.  One being a car my husband announced he would never drive, much less buy.  Okay then, expect a much larger car payment dude.  The second vehicle was out of stock.  So we looked at the third.  Salesman was supposedly a retired Jersey cop...gruff I guess you could say.  Tried to tell me I wouldn't want the vehicle they didn't have...uh, look out front, I'm driving one.  Pulled all the usual stops like asking me what kind of payment I was looking for, etc.  I especially liked that he lit a cigarette in front of us outside.  But my favorite part, worthy of an extra star was this:  Him:  "So what else are you looking at?" Me:  "a Volkswagen" Him:  "Oh God (grabs his face in his hands), why the hell would you want that?  Those people can't even fight a war."

A little outdated, but then again so am I.  After driving by Salt Cellar for 3 years, we finally ventured in or maybe I should say we ventured "under."  It's quite small inside.  Maybe space underground is at a premium?    We had requested a booth after a suggestion in another review, and were accommodated after a short wait in the bar.  Good decision as seating is somewhat tight, but those booths are huge!  Seafood is obviously their specialty, but there are beef and chicken options on the menu as well.  We started with Shrimp San Remo as recommended by our server, and it was definitely recommendation worthy.  I could have skipped the shrimp and just had the bowl of sauce and a basket of bread and been completely happy.  I ordered scallops, sauteed in butter and sherry with fresh mushrooms.  How can you go wrong there?  Only if the scallops are gritty or overcooked, and they were neither.  Perfect.  My husband ordered another recommended dish, baked stuffed lobster.  A whole lobster stuffed with shrimp and crab.  Tell me that isn't an ingenious idea!  But here's one of my favorite things about Salt Cellar.  I like crab, but never order it because it's just too much work to eat it.  Not here.  They do the dirty work for you at the table.  Now that's a reason for me to go back, even if I have to look at gold picture frames!

Thanks to Anthony's review, I was able to cook a halfway decent meal for my Mexican step-mommy.  I would not have attempted such a feat had it not been she was just returning from New York, and I assumed that had not been on their menu the last two weeks.  I could handle the enchiladas pretty well (and got excellent reviews BTW), but I didn't want to mess with the carne asada.  I wished I had more time to peruse the shelves, but I was in a hurry.  The guys at the meat counter didn't seem to speak English, but for all I knew, they spoke perfect English and were enjoying my feeble attempts to order in Spanish.  I managed to get out "dos libras", but then he rattled a question off in Spanish.  Of that, I thought I heard "preparada" and responded "si," praying he was asking if I wanted the meat in the marinade and not if I needed hemorrhoid medication.  The meat was a little fatty, but I'm one of those people that thinks every butcher should trim to my standards, which are quite ridiculous.  But their marinade is fantastic!  I also picked up some flour tortillas.  Okay, better than typical store brands.  I would recommend heating those on the grill, too.  Two pounds of meat and tortillas for under $20.  Yay!

When I moved to the Valley, our first place was a rental in Old Town.  The previous tenant/owner generously left a bunch of take-out menus for nearby restaurants.  Defalco's was one of them.  But not being a fan of the sandwich, it took me four years and a move to actually go in.  What a fool I was.  This place is fantastic!    First off, it's not just a deli, it's an Italian market.  Had I actually read the full name of the place, I might have known that.  It's also got a somewhat extensive selection of wine available for purchase.  So now we've moved from a deli, to a grocer, to a wine shop.  Don't forget the pasta dishes and the pastry, too.    My fave sandwich is the tomato, mozz, and basil on a sub roll with olive oil and balsamic.  Simple, yet perfection.  I'm a huge fan of those sub rolls by the way.  Crusty on the outside, but not so crusty that it makes a big mess every time you take a bite, yet soft and chewy on the inside.  It's always about the bread for me.  Great selection of prepared salads in the deli as well.  One of the best red potato salads I've had in a long time.  It certainly won't take me another four years to go back.  I think I've been there just about every week in the last month!

If you like soda or pop or soda pop or whatever you prefer to call it, now would be a good time to come to my house.  We have 31 bottles...or we did, I've seen my husband with a different drink several times today.  Half the fun is the shopping, the other half the drinking of course.  Don't believe they have every soda imaginable, however.  No Sun Drop (I'm not sure they ever stock it anymore) and no Dublin Dr. Pepper for now.  But, we did manage to find plenty else to try.  I won't name everything we bought--partly because you probably don't care and partly because you need to be surprised when you visit!  And with that, I believe I am a little parched.  I think I hear a Sprecher cool & spicy ginger ale calling.

We just returned from the 4th of July Red, Wright, and Blue event.  Not sure if publicly advertised as we received a card in the mail since we have a membership.  This particular event was $60 a ticket.  That bought a tour, food, 2 drinks, music, and seating for the fireworks.  I'm not quite sure what the tour was supposed to entail as we got quite the thunderstorm, and all the guides were improvising to keep people indoors as much as possible.  I believe it was a modified Insights tour.   Our tour guide actually looked nervous, as if she wasn't sure the roof would not cave in!  The rain offered a very different perspective.  We know the living room leaks:)  It was quite spectacular actually.  Food and entertainment was indoors.  As we understand, this was not the case last year, and it was supposedly pretty dang hot.  The food was a light meal (appetizer, barbecue sliders, and dessert).  The rain cleared in time for the fireworks around the Valley and dropped the temperature considerably making for a beautiful evening.  You can actually watch several shows at once.  Although the fireworks are all at a distance, it is quite amazing to see several shows simultaneously against the city lights, and in our case, intermingled with lightning.  Awesome.  I wish the entertainment had moved outdoors, however, to drown out the loud-mouthed, know-it-all next to us.  Can't have everything I guess.  Every tour we have taken has been informative.  We have enjoyed all of the guides, and each offers little tidbits of info on Wright's work, his life, and his personality that you won't have heard before.  When we purchased a membership, tours were only available May through September, I believe.  Now, they have a wider variety of tours available year-round.  I would HIGHLY recommend tours in the cooler weather as some of the living areas are not cooled, and even the ones that are cooled are still quite warm.  Check out their website www.franklloydwright.org for details, prices, etc.  Great place to take architectural buffs or HGTV fans.

First visit 3 stars, second visit 2 stars unfortunately.  I don't doubt the pasta is still A-OK, but I have to knock them down for their entree-sized salads.    I ordered a Caesar with chicken.  The addition of the chicken bumped the price of this jewel up to $12.95.  While plentiful, the romaine was so drenched in dressing, the crispness of the lettuce was lost.  The chicken was mediocre at best, certainly not worth the 5 bucks to add it.  A shame because the dressing was pretty good.  My husband ordered the Antipasto per Due.  With back olives, artichokes, ham, salami, provolone, and anchovies, it should have been a hit.  But again, drenched in vinaigrette.  Also the meats and cheese were just thin slices, nothing of exceptional quality.  At $14.95, this was a miss.  We also ordered bruschetta, but I had forgotten all their bread is sesame seed "sub rolls."  Better bread is a must.  While I might consider Lo Cascio again, I'll stick with pasta.  If you see me carry a duffel bag inside, I brought my own baguette, too.

I needed a new camera bag and found myself at Tempe Camera.  Wow!  It was like a smorgasbord of all things camera.  Repair, lab, equipment, books and supplies all under one roof.  They also rent equipment for what seems to be quite reasonable prices, including a negative scanner I may check out.  Staff was friendly, and I found a bag I like-small backpack that doesn't weigh 40 lbs empty either.  Although I was not planning to return it,  I came home and priced the same bag on Amazon to see just how much more I had to pay to try out that bag in person.  And Tempe Camera actually had the better price!

It's nice when Plan B turns out better than Plan A would have been had it not failed so miserably.  Thanks to Yelp, we did not leave Cave Creek hungry (then again, we never leave anywhere hungry), but we did leave happy.  I love the homey feeling this little gem offers.  Alberto himself greets his guests, takes orders, and serves us as if we are family.  Well, maybe not my family, but someone else's much warmer and friendlier family.  We quickly devoured the fresh bread and dipping oil, moving on to delicious Caesar salads.  How I love a well-dressed salad.  After seeing one too many episodes of Hell's Kitchen, my husband opted for risotto.  No need to settle on what's offered on the menu, as they will prepare it any way you'd like.  Alberto suggested a seafood risotto with a spicy tomato sauce.  This was perfection with ample shrimp, lobster, scallops and mussels.  The tomato sauce was spicy, but not overpowering.    Alberto does offer one hand-made pasta, fettucini.  I opted for a simple dish of this pasta with fresh tomato and garlic.  The fettucini was perfect, but I found the dish a tad salty and the thickly sliced garlic was not cooked enough IMHO.  I enjoyed the meal, but the risotto was really the star of this show.  For dessert, we shared a tart with fig jam.  Alberto's jams are hand-made as well.  Needless to say it was a mistake to share this dessert.  I wanted my own and will have it next time.  And there will be a next time.

I'm not sure if Durant's is really 5-star worthy, but something about it, I gotta say I like...a lot.  I also don't know what mind boggling insightful information I can provide after 90 plus reviews, but I'll put in my 2 cents (dammit, here we go again with the lack of a cents key on my keyboard--typewriters have them you know!) which will buy you nothing BTW.  Yes, there's red velvet wallpaper and one could argue the interior is more like a "before" shot, but that's part of its charm ("charm"...one of those words you don't like to read in a real estate listing, much like "cozy" or "up & coming neighborhood.")  But I think anyone over the age of 40...I'm not saying I am over 40 mind you...will appreciate the comfortable, recognizable, glimpse into the past it offers you.  I would have never seen the inside of a place like Durant's as a kid since I would have either been left at home or sent to the car (my parents had no problems with sticking you in the car even when it was 110 outside), but I can imagine this is what I missed.  Service did start a little rocky.  Rocky as in at least 10-15 minutes for someone to even consider taking a drink order.  But when I ordered a sloe gin fizz, I did not get a blank stare, however, I'm pretty sure I did not get sloe gin either.  There was a little overkill on the sweet, so hard to tell.    Once we were able to order a drink, service was impeccable...see what a drink in hand can do for you?  We had oysters rockefeller which were seriously delicious, and I had the scallop and filet combination.  Scallops were perfectly seared and the filet was almost fork tender.  Garlic mashed potatoes were not hot enough, nor garlicky enough either.  But I forgot all about that when I saw the size of the strawberry shortcake.  When you're sharing, size does matter.  So I love Durant's in spite of a few shortcomings, and I would happily return.  Maybe in a few years, when my dad is really old, I can send his ass to the car.

This was my first visit to Chase Field.  Unfortunately, we were in the Press Suite over home plate, which has ruined my desire to ever go again as a commoner.  Now I like baseball to an extent.  At one time, I was a die-hard Dodgers fanatic.  In fact, I can still almost name every player circa 1982.  But now, I get a little bored after the first few innings.  That's where the Press Suite comes in.  I can get up, walk around, sit on a couch, mosey up to the buffet, order a drink, choose something from the dessert cart, or watch the game.  My only little complaint is there was a "glass" partition along one side of the viewing area, and it would be nice if they washed it once in a while.  But other than that, 5-star experience!

I don't know what possessed me to eat here.  Maybe I thought if it was good enough for George Dubya, it would be good enough for me.  I expected grease, I expected a lackluster interior, and I expected mediocre food.  I guess it met my expectations.  Because nothing is too good for my husband's wife, he chose the "presidential" table for us, complete with the "hasn't been cleaned since 2004 presidential plaque."  Chips and salsa arrived promptly.  The chips were thin and crispy, but far too greasy.  The salsa was not the greatest either.  I ordered a chimichanga deciding it was going to be my last fat-laden meal for at least a month, or a week, whichever comes first, because I wanted the crispy tortilla.  Unfortunately, only the very ends of it were crispy.  The rest was drenched in sour cream and some pretty seriously bad gray-green guacamole which made the whole thing soggy.  What a sad waste of the deep-frying process.  Inside was green chile, made with beef, rather than my favored pork.  It wasn't too bad, but from what spilled out, I could see there was far too much grease in it.  Not that I was expecting healthy here, but this was ridiculous.  I almost didn't eat it, but I did.  Would I come back?  It's not at the top of my list, but if I say no, I'll end up there next week.  I did see they have pretty good drink specials, and the place was quite busy, so someone must like it more than I do.

Had dinner with friends at Sapporo a few months ago.  Although I'm not a fan of Japanese food (that's probably on the what must be a VERY short list of things my husband would change about me), I loved the teppanyaki grill.  Pricing, dependent on your entree, includes a shrimp starter, soup, salad, fried rice, and veggies.  Plus a little sorbet at the end.  Standouts were the fried rice, which is a complete meal itself, and the sea bass/filet mignon combo ($42).  The sea bass was melt in your mouth and the filet fork tender.  The pineapple martini was also fantastic.  My only complaint is that like most teppan grills, they like to cram in as many seats as possible.  If I wanted to sit in someone's lap, I would prefer to do it in private and away from my spouse.  Also, do not under any circumstances, consider Sapporo for a quiet romantic dinner.  It is crowded and it is loud, but I can see the appeal.

The last time I walked through Mandalay Bay had been 5 years ago, and I remember thinking "it would be nice to stay here sometime."  And it might have been 5 years ago, maybe not so much today.  Certainly not a bad hotel, but I expected more from one of the mega hotels.  On the plus side, the resort as a whole presents well on the surface.  They have several pools and a wave pool with a sandy beach, although the beach-side casino that was to open at 11 had still not opened by 11:15.  Their loss in this case.  There's an aquarium which is pretty cool, but that and the beach make Mandalay Bay more "family friendly" than I would prefer.    Although the resort is on the far end of the strip, there's a tram that runs to Luxor and Excalibur, and it's not far from there to pick up another that runs all the way to Bellagio.  These are free, but they don't run all night, so expect to take a cab if you don't feel like walking through a sea of arms offering you "trading cards."  I highly recommend this experience if you have children, however, and are looking to provide them with the complete Las Vegas experience.   As for the hotel itself, the rooms are spacious, and our strip-view room actually looked down the strip, rather than across the street.  They could use some updating though.  The tub was dingy, and so was the tile of the shower floor.  There's an odd window in the bath that faces the entry to the room.  A nice peep show for room service I guess, except in my case, it would be more like a horror show.  There were double sinks, but only one was usable thanks to the disgusting gurgling and subsequent back-up we experienced on a daily/nightly basis when it wasn't even being used!  Room service was the bright spot of the hotel.  Delivery was prompt and complete, and the server was very courteous.  At check-out, I was charged for a $30 bottle of vodka and a $30 spa tip in error.  While I may have tripped the sensor in the mini-bar, I'm pretty sure I was sober enough to remember I did not drink it.  After undergoing the interrogation about that, I was subjected to further interrogation about the spa tip.  Since I never went to the spa, I'm pretty certain I didn't tip anyone there.  And wouldn't it be odd that only the tip, and not the service, would be charged to the room?  Although Mandalay Bay is far from being the worst hotel I've visited, it won't be on my rotation in Las Vegas.  There are just too many other better places to stay.

Other than the clown element, I really enjoyed O.  Fire, water, and acrobatics all made for an enjoyable performance.  However, if there was a story, I had no idea what it was.  But to be fair, we sat in the VIP suites at the back of the theater.  Private suites that seat four (although we had only two in our party) with a bottle of champagne, chocolate-covered strawberries and truffles.  So I probably spent more time counting how many chocolates my husband was taking over his 50% than paying attention.  The private entrance came in handy when my husband claimed he set an alarm for 6 pm and yet I woke up at 7:10 wondering why I was so well-rested.  After the fastest costume change ever, we literally ran to the theater and arrived just after it started, but did not disturb anyone.  The cocktail server whisked in just behind us to open the champagne.  I was miffed at my husband for missing the chance to get our photo, but a photographer came to our suite before I had a chance to start bitching.    Sadly, the $335 per ticket price did not include a photo, which I looked hideous in, but yet I still felt compelled to buy both for $90 so I could study at my leisure which one was less ghastly.  I am just grateful he told me to pose in such a way to hide the arm fat.  I later got an email that I could buy a digital download which I would have rather done to begin with so I could work my wonders with Photoshop.  So before you buy a photo with the stupid album you might not want anyway, ask if you can just fill out the card with your email address for the download.    I probably wouldn't see O again, but I thought it was a great show and really enjoyed the suite!

If location were the only criteria, Jade Palace would get 10 stars.  Conveniently located next to Sweet Republic, Jade Palace offers the perfect opportunity to suggest Chinese for dinner, knowing you'll end up with heaven for dessert.  Probably 3.5 stars, but feeling generous today.  I'm pretty sure this is why my husband suggested it.  But I had wanted to try it as well, and I'm glad we did.  Nicer inside than your average strip mall restaurant, I was surprised by the space.  Nothing too modern or contemporary here, but white tablecloths and candles on the table make for a nice atmosphere.  Our service was excellent as well.  We started with crab puffs and BBQ ribs.  The crab puffs were a pleasant surprise in that you could actually taste...get ready for this...crab.  In contrast to the typical cream cheese with flecks of pink you usually get, which I confess to love.  The BBQ ribs were way too fatty  with very little meat.    I always go with the safe dishes and ordered lemon chicken.  I was expecting the usual chopped up chicken, dredged in batter, and swimming in sauce.  What I got was the actual chicken breast, sliced, with a delicate lemon sauce spooned over the top.    My husband ordered the crispy roast duck, bone in.  I didn't try it, but I could see that it was, indeed, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  He must have liked it because he ate no rice at all, and he loves rice, usually eats a pile of it.  I'll let some of our Yelper's with more sophisticated palates argue that Jade is Americanized Chinese food.  For me, I'm a fan and will return next time I need a Sweet Republic fix.

Beautiful little shop.  It's all about presentation here-the decor, the cases, the garnishes on the gelato, and the bathroom...let's just say it's most likely cleaner and nicer than your own.  A billion flavors to choose from.  Or at least it seems like a billion when you're under pressure to choose one before everyone else in line gets pissed off at your indecisiveness.  But as for the gelato, it's good but not the best I've had.  I actually prefer Gelato Old Town in Scottsdale which is far less pretentious.  Also, today there were air pockets in my cup.  Yes, air pockets.  When I'm paying $3.50 for a tiny little cup, I expect it to be packed in there.  We are the fattest country in the world-we didn't get that way with air pockets!

3.5 stars  This was actually a difficult visit to rate.  We had 2-star service.  Now before the loyal FEZ following stones me, just remember that only means "I've had better."  Yet the food had 5 star potential.    My husband and I stopped for dinner after the Heard Museum event last night.  Neither of us had been to FEZ,  *hangs head in shame* and we were both excited to finally try it--me because of the food, him...well he loves Fez on That 70's Show.  Maybe that's enough.  So here's the good things we found:  When our table was ready, the host did not scream our name across the room deafening those in immediate earshot.  He actually remembered who we are and approached us.  Our bartender was fast and attentive in spite of it being crazy busy.  I tried the Feztini.  It was $9.50 I think.  Now I'm from Circa 1990 where my favorite club had $3 cover and $1 drink nights.  So $10 bought me a pretty good time, and some other stuff like drunks trying to bum a buck off of you.  So for a $10 drink, I expect a lot.  FEZ delivered.  For a girlie drink, I'm pretty sure more than one would take me out.  While we were waiting for a table, we saw the manager (wait, could it have been our own Thomas S-does he work there?) mixing drinks, delivering food, wiping tables, just doin' what needed doin' (doing' what, not doin' who).    The food was great.  I went with everyone else's faves--hummus, sweet potato fries, and rosemary chicken sandwich.  The hummus was garlicky good and the green olives make it garlicky great.  Everyone raves about the fries, now I know why.  Cinnamon dusted and a maple dipping sauce.  This is like crack for a sweet potato fry junkie.  And the sandwich was the perfect combination of ingredients.  Now the not so good:  My food, including the fries, was just barely warm (thus the 5-star potential).  Luckily it was so good  it wasn't terribly upsetting.  The wait between appetizers and entrees was really long.  But that was understandable given the crowd.  The problem was our server.  Though friendly, he did the minimum.  During the wait, he could have sold my husband another beer twice over.  I don't mind waiting if I feel taken care of.  Making sure we had drinks and an acknowledgment we weren't forgotten, maybe an apology for the wait goes a long way.  And I just saw the Feb special posted.  It would have been nice if our server had offered that information.  It sounds great!  I am looking forward to going back so FEZ can earn the extra half star.  Heck maybe 5!

After pondering whether to give FEZ that 5th star after two entirely different experiences, I took a look at my history.  Only three 5-star restaurant reviews, and two are hole-in-the wall Mexican joints.  Self, why is that?  Well, I love Mexican food, but don't get culinary on me with it.  And my only expectations for 5-stars are great but cheap food, adequate service (if applicable) and not seeing a roach flit by.  Yet, in a nicer place, I expect the whole package.  My husband and I had dinner for the second time at FEZ last night.  Upon walking in, we notice our less than spectacular server from the last visit was working.  I remarked that I supposed we would be unfortunate enough to have him as our server again, and he was.  But wait!  Is this the same guy?  Maybe he had a bad night before, maybe management flogged him after my first review.  Anywhoo, he was attentive, efficient, and friendly from the start of the meal through picking up our check.    Our food was fantastic, and hot this time!  We had to have the hummus and those sweet potato fries again, diet be damned!  We shared the ribeye, and it is definitely enough for two. The ribeye was a wonderful cut and cooked to perfection.  The accompanying summer vegetable succotash was light and crisp, and perfectly complemented the steak.  We also shared the chocolate mousse, though by now I was wishing I had worn elastic.  Mmmmm.    So I'm bumping FEZ up a star for the wonderful evening, and crossing my fingers that this is a more typical experience here.

For those of you in the dark ages, or perhaps new to Yelp or FEZ, FEZ Foodies is not just for Yelpers.  It's actually open to everyone the 2nd and 4th Sundays of each month from 5pm -8pm I believe.  It's a wonderful opportunity to sample new dishes that may or may not make it to the big leagues (the FEZ menu) someday.  If you choose to order one of these new creations, you're asked to critique the dish, make suggestions, etc.  That's right.  Someone actually wants your opinion even if it's to say "well that tasted like crap."  I attended my first Foodies event last night as part of a Yelp event organized by the host with the most, Thomas S, and I am certain it won't be the last.  This is a fantastic concept!  And with the unbearable temps just around the corner, there's no better way to spend a Sunday afternoon than sipping a cocktail and being a backseat chef!  As a side note, if there's no special dessert offered to tempt you, get the almond shortbread.  This FEZ version of strawberry shortcake is seriously the best dessert I can recall having in a LONG time!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE Sierra Bonita Grill after only one visit.  We went during restaurant week, so I could try more things.  And let me tell you, the amount of food we got for the price was ridiculous.  Ridiculous in a good way.  My starter was the chips & guacamole with 3 salsas.  I judge heavily by chips & salsa and theirs passed with flying colors.  My husband had the shrimp ceviche.  I should say "we" had the shrimp ceviche as there was easily enough for two.  It, too, was delicious.  HIs entree was the carne asada.  I did not try, but he commented the steak was seasoned nicely and not overdone for a change.  I had the green chile pork roast which was chucks of perfectly tender pork in a spicy, but not too hot, green chile sauce.  For dessert he had the buttermilk pie, and I can't remember mine, because his was better.  I hate when that happens.  And I almost forgot the best part....the tortillas!!!  While not Carolina's, these are a little thicker and really, really good with the little toasty brown spots from being warmed over an open flame.  It was so good, I purposely saved half to eat with my leftovers.  But our server was so awesome that when he boxed up my food and I asked him to please include my tortilla, he gave me a brand new one, too!  Yeah, he got an extra big tip for that.  If I were closer, SBG would be a weekly destination, but it's definitely on my return list.  And did I tell you I LOVE it?

I really, really, really enjoy Zuzu.  I love the style of the restaurant.  The high-backed booths make a huge difference.  It's bad enough when you have to listen to another table's overly loud conversation, seeing them makes it that much worse for me.  I always enjoy my meal (kicked up comfort food) and have never had bad service either.  And when I mentioned last night we were not staying at the hotel as we live down the street,  I  learned they have a "Zuzu neighbors" discount card (15% off) that's good thru 2009!  That pays for my husband's Bourbon Mac Daddy!  4.5 starts for me!

I have to add a star after having breakfast here thanks to Gabi K's review.  I had the special of eggs florentine--eggs scrambled with mushrooms, spinach, and bacon and topped with swiss cheese and hollandaise.  I skipped the hollandaise for calories sake (yes I probably should have skipped this dish altogether, but you gotta start somewhere).  It was served with their roasted potatoes which were so good thanks to the thinly-sliced onion.  I love that their orange juice is freshly squeezed.     Service was spot on as always.  Never an empty coffee cup or juice glass.  Now what I really wanted to try is the reason I'll be back soon--stuffed french toast made with cranberry walnut bread and cream cheese filling.  How good does that sound? Anyone free tomorrow?

This is a rare instance when I don't always think my meal is 5-star worthy, but I cannot drop a star.  I love ZuZu that much!  I don't go that often, but I'm always reminded why I should.  Actually, I'm reminded whenever I watch It's A Wonderful Life  I am finally learning that for dinner I should stick with the beef stroganoff.  As much as I have enjoyed other meals, I always miss having that sin on a plate.  And where else are you going to find that dish anymore?  My only criticism is sometimes they don't drain the noodles enough, and there's too much water in the bowl.  But even that can't ruin the rich mushroom sauce with the pint of sour cream on top just waiting for me to marry the two.  Enough for two meals!  My 2013 resolution?  Go to ZuZu outside the month of December.

You can gamble and drink 24/7, but try to find a place to eat after 10 pm.  Your options are pretty limited.  We arrived at Raffles about 10:30 pm after an excruciatingly long elevator ride with some drunkard behind us, and were greeted with a 20-minute wait.  Why?  The restaurant was pretty empty.  Service was even slower than the wait to get in, although our server was pleasant.  Finally our food arrives-an order of hummus which was better than I expected, minus the stale pita bread, and the double-decker sliders which arrived closer to well done than the medium we ordered, but were still very good.  Had the wait time been less, I would have given Raffles 3 stars, especially given the fact our wait for a table was enhanced by previously mentioned elevator drunkard arriving shortly after us and promptly vomiting in the planters at the entrance for a good 15 minutes while the hostess who was facing him pretended not to notice.  Finally another patron complained and she called for clean-up, but still never asked him to at least step around corner where there is nothing but employee only exit doors.  The hostess was gracious enough, however, to comply with elevator drunkard's insignificant other's request for a glass of water with no apologies.  I just felt bad for the poor maintenance guy.  Have you ever tried to clean puke off of rocks?  Can't be easy.  I guess my job isn't so bad after all.

Great festival!  Because my husband lived in Japan for several years, we had to go both days this year.  Ate, watched the entertainers, ate again, went through the booths, ate some more.  You get the idea.  If you are planning on a meal, I would suggest going late morning or late afternoon.  The food area was horribly crowded from about 1-3.  My favorite things this year were the drummers, bonsai trees, and getting my name written in Japanese calligraphy on a very pretty paper!  It's over for now, but there's always next year!

Had a lovely anniversary dinner here in September in spite of Restaurant Week.  I say "in spite of" because I'm not really a fan of that week.  My few experiences have been at overcrowded restaurants with mediocre service at best.  But we bit the bullet and made a reservation anyway.  First off, let me highly recommend you try to secure a reservation on an evening when a dust storm is blowing in.  Assuming it clears out, all the residual filth in the air will make for a gorgeous sunset.  And like it or not, you're going to pay for that view.  Luckily, I liked it.  I started with a wine trio.  Honestly, I don't remember which one, but anytime someone puts three glasses of wine in front of me at the same time, we're off to a good start.  Then on to the Southwest Caesar.  I love a good Caesar, but the twist with the ancho caesar dressing and shaved manchego was a nice change.  For my entree, a scallop dish with a chipotle sauce.  I forget the name of the sauce, but it's a very sweet sauce, almost syrup-like.  Unfortunately, the chipotle did not come through to balance the sweetness, but the scallops were cooked perfectly.   I finished with my own dessert (I don't share on special occasions), the peach upside down cake.  I LOVE upside down cake, but this one did not live up to my expectations.  The components were all there, but there was no caramelization to the peaches.  And without the golden brown, crusty, sugary top, what's the point of the upside down?   So food was closer to 3.5 stars, but with the great view and fantastic service, a much deserved bump to 4 stars.

"You smell like smoke."  That's the greeting I received when coming home from a terrific UYE organized by BBQ lovin' Deb L.  And at that point, if my stuffed self didn't already know it, I knew I had just eaten some damn good food.  Upon arriving, I had a deja vu moment of being there before...a long time ago, sipping a virgin strawberry daiquiri (I told you it was a long time ago), and thinking I was all that.  Yes, it was Bobby McGee's at one time!  So flash forward 25 years, and I'm having a strawberry lemonade "adult" beverage, which was quite tasty btw, in the company of 20 fabulous Yelpers!  We were given corn bread pretty quickly, and it was devoured pretty quickly.  A little on the crumbly side, but delicious nonetheless.  Because my husband could not join us, I went with the 2-meat combo (brisket and pulled pork) so there would be some left to take him.  Yeah, that's my story.  I was a happy eater to find I could order my meats sauce free!  The brisket was good, but a little too fatty.  The pork was really good, however; adequately seasoned and smokey.  I tried the spicy sauce on the table, and found it to be just right, just a little kick to it.  For sides, the mac and cheese was creamy and not lacking in sauce.  Yum.  The roasted corn was really really good.  If corn always tasted that good, I would move to Iowa.  Our service was great and they were accommodating for our request for separate checks with a 20% gratuity.  Our service was actually good enough, especially given a party that size, that I tipped extra.  And I did refrain from eating all of my meal, so that I could have a nice lunch the next day when my husband refused my offer of the leftovers.  Only problem was he didn't refuse.  And I went hungry the next day, wishing I had eaten all of my meal when I had the chance.

Alright I never thought of reviewing the IKEA cafeteria before.  But my husband and I ran into Audrey W and HER plus one (yes, kind of pathetic we were both at IKEA on a holiday weekend), and she mentioned the cafeteria has not only been reviewed but gets glowing ratings.  You gotta be kidding me.    Yes, the food isn't bad and some of it is actually pretty good.  But usually if you're eating there, you're fed up and in dire need of being fed, which could taint your perspective just a bit.  But the rest of the experience is tolerable at best, nauseating at its worst.  Today was a typical experience.  Most of the trays were wet or dirty or both.  I had to go through several glasses to find acceptably clean ones...acceptably clean, not necessarily clean.  The line was backed up so we thought paying cash would be good.  Too bad the guy working did not have change to break a $20 when our bill was $18.30.  Most every table was dirty.  There was no ligonberry drink (the one highlight of this experience in general) to be found.  A small child was spotted running around like a lunatic, only stopping long enough to eat food off of a dirty plate she found in the clean up pile.  Parents?  Anywhere?  Hello?  Unfortunately, I was not in the men's room to witness the horror of a man chasing a naked child through the restroom...naked as in completely naked.  Luckily it was the child and not the man.  And luckily it was not my husband doing the chasing.  At least I don't think it was.  So if this is everyone's idea of a 5-star experience, I'm sorry for you or maybe for me for not seeing what everyone else does.  In any case, I've had better, but I'm sure I will be back.

My husband and I were given a collection of Penzey's Spices as a wedding gift years ago, and it was one of the best gifts we received.  Little did I know, we would be moving to Scottsdale a few years later and would find a store in our backyard!  If you like to cook, you will find every spice, seasoning mix, and dried herb imaginable.  If you don't like to cook, you will still find every spice, seasoning mix, and herb imaginable and you will want to start cooking, or at least start a beautiful "collection" of their products.  I love their products are generally available in a smaller "I only need a little" size as well as standard size spice jars, and some in larger bags for refilling.  Empty jars are available, too!  On my last visit, I found hot cocoa mix, and with winter just around the corner...okay the corner has a wide berth.  Maybe frozen hot chocolate is in order!  The only problem with Penzey's is I calculate it's going to cost me about $40,000 to build a suitable kitchen to house their products.  It's worth it.

All I can say is don't think you're going to pop in and out because all you need is an onion.  And don't bother coming unless you just got paid.  Because if you're anything like me, that onion will cost you about $80 by the time you leave.  Because AJ's is so pricey, you won't see my buying paper towels and cat litter here.  But you will find an assortment of cheeses, pastries, or whatever else I can't live without in my basket.  Their meat department is far superior to any supermarket I've been in.  And the produce always looks picture perfect.  The staff is always exceptionally friendly and helpful.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same for many of the snotty patrons you may encounter.  Don't let that deter you from the experience.  And, oh yea, don't forget the onion.

Stopped here before the Bon Jovi concert.  And no, I was not one of the 40-something gals that looked like my dress was manufactured in a scissor factory hobbling around in 6-inch stilettos hoping to attract the attention of the god of 80's rockers.  But I highly recommend attending such a concert, if for nothing else, the people watching.  And not just for the women.  I thoroughly enjoyed the guy in front of me and his air drumming skills.  Anywho, back to Biersch's.  It was packed, but we did find a seat on the patio.  I liked that the bar was open to both the restaurant and the patio, so that you could sit at the bar but still be outside.  I was concerned about being late, but my husband, who is apparently way cooler than me, schooled me in that it's perfectly acceptable to arrive late.  Uh, when it's over $300 for 2 tickets, I want to see EVERYTHING.  In spite of the crowds, our server Michael, was on top of it, as was the bar.  Drinks came really quickly.  The kitchen was a little slower, as was expected, but still reasonable.  We ordered the Brewer's Feast ($17) which included Kobe sliders, garlic fries, southwest egg rolls, and hummus.  The sliders and fries were 4.5-star good IMO, egg rolls 4 stars, and hummus 2.5 stars since the crostini was not very good.  We also ordered one each of the mini dessert tasters...strawberry cheesecake, chocolate cake, brownie mousse, and apple bread pudding.  None were outstanding.  I think the mousse was my favorite.  Not sure a full meal would garner my 4-star rating, but for drinks and appetizers, I'm a fan.  And we were on time!  BTW, when did a t-shirt become 50 bucks?  I'm pretty sure they were not that much in 1986!

So my husband had been traveling on business almost every week for 2 months.  He's finally home, and his company hosts some sort of conference at The Boulders.  He was planning to drive in from Scottsdale each day, but they "forced" him to stay.  So I was also "forced" to stay his last night there.  It was a sacrifice no wife should have to make, but I sucked it up and did so...for him, because I'm that kind of a person.  First of all, this is not just your typical resort.  I was greeted at the guard station by a roadrunner.  How cool is that?  On the drive in from the gate, I was amazed at the size of this property.  It is roughly 1300 acres of beautiful desert with a couple golf courses sprinkled in the mix.   Wildlife galore.  You know the phrase "multiplying like rabbits?"  I get it now.  They are everywhere, as are quail.  I'm sure there are also less desirable residents, like the mouse that ran up to me outside the lobby like an old friend, but it's his home, too!  The casitas are so charming, and I mean that in a good way.  Nice sitting area with a fireplace, incredibly comfortable beds, and huge bathrooms.  The walk-in closet was larger than my closet at home.  There is a nice little vanity area just off the bathroom for the ladies to sit and apply the makeup they claim to not wear.  Our balcony off the back of the casita was completely private.  You could not even see another casita from there!  Since the resort is so large, there are always golf carts available upon request to take you anywhere on grounds or to the neighboring El Pedregal for shopping or dining.  This service is especially beneficial in the summer as many of the casitas are quite far from the lobby or parking.  And speaking of parking, no charge for either self-park or valet.  Complimentary bottled water as well.  And not only is The Boulders pet friendly, they have a pet program with special meals and photo sessions.  Seriously.  If I had a pet, this is where it would want to stay.

My husband and joined a group of Yelpers at Corbin's after the OYE last week.  I had never been there, and was excited to go somewhere new.  Unfortunately, after perhaps one too many at the event, I wasn't at my best for observation of the surroundings.  I do know we had excellent service, however.  Although we began arriving after 9 pm (they close at 10), they were happy to push tables together and keep the kitchen open.  They were willing to do separate checks for our large group as well.  As for the food, I was honestly so hungry, I didn't spend much time analyzing it.  Everything I tried was tasty though, and I would not hesitate to go back.  Disclaimer:  see first paragraph.

Here we go again with ridiculously priced guacamole, but it was so good I forgot about the price.  And the jalapeno shooters?  Genius.  I only wish we had ordered a "double barrel" and not a "six shooter."  We only had appetizers on my one visit to Spotted Donkey, but it was enough that I wouldn't mind the drive up to Carefree a second time with the obligatory stay at The Boulders...just in case we shouldn't drive home.

Stopped by for a quick breakfast last Saturday and was greeted by a tempting display of muffins, bagels, and other delectable goodies, all of which I passed up in favor of something with more sustenance.  There is plenty of seating, both booths and tables, including a large round cocktail table if you just want to relax while you drink your coffee and read a paper.  Might be useful if I was a coffee drinker or a paper reader.    Order at the counter, and they will serve you when it's ready.  I had the ham and egg sandwich (scrambled eggs, Taylor ham, swiss cheese).   Simple, yet delicious.  The ciabatta roll made the sandwich, of course.    There was so much filling, I couldn't finish it, but I ate every last crumb of that roll.  I'm glad Wildflower isn't too far from me, but I'm also glad it's not too close, or I would be in serious trouble here.

A review long, long overdue, but clearly they are not hurting for good reviews.  Fuego had been on my list for a long time, and fellow Yelp pal Christina P generously shared her Groupon with me.  Now while there has seemingly been a lot of complaints lately about restaurants treating their Groupon customers poorly, we experienced no such negativity.  I went with the seafood chile relleno..."scallop,shrimp, and Mahi Mahi stuffed in a jumbo Pasilla pepper with a panko crust and a lobster chile cream sauce."  I will let the description speak for itself other than adding, "yes, it was that damn good."  As was the green chili cornbread and jalapeño creamed corn.  The restaurant is small, but they have a very lovely patio.  Someday in the distant future, it will be usable again.  Until then, I imagine a reservation would be a necessity and deservingly so.

Wow.  Everyone is right-this place really is a dive.  Stained seats, trash on the floor, and is that bird poop on the screen?  Maybe I should have washed my car first.  Seriously, maybe Scottsdale 6 is a dive, but what would make for a "nice" drive-in?  Aren't they all the same?  Then there's the complaints about the sound system.  Are you kidding me?  Compared to the days of hanging a speaker off your window, listening to the movie through your FM radio is like the most advanced sound system in the universe.    I hadn't been to the drive in since the late 70's, as a child of course, and not a lot has changed...except the price.  $6.25 for a double feature, and new movies to boot!  I didn't visit the snack bar as we brought our own freshly popped corn with a touch of sea salt and a little butter..mmm.  I also didn't visit the bathrooms because I still have some degree of bladder control.      My complaints...total train wreck getting in.  Double-sided ticket booths with only one attendant working both sides.  Cash only when it's quicker to swipe a card than make change.  Since the first showing for all movies is 7:45, it might be better to have the lanes correspond to the movie you're seeing with overhead signs identifying the radio station and the screen number.  As it is, the attendants have to go through all that with you as well as directions to your screen.  I would also suggest if you want to check the movies online you don't use the website listed here, it only gives you the times of each movie--not which movies are paired on the same screen.  Instead, use http://www.movietickets.com/house_detail.asp?house_id=3998  I like that I can zone in and out of the movie and ask my husband to explain it to me without disturbing anyone, even if he doesn't.  I like that I can recline my seat, and not have my knees buckle under when I get up after 2 hours of sitting in the same position.  I like that I don't need a payday loan to buy a Coke.  And I like that I could go to the movies with a cough!  This little conversation was a bonus:  Me:  Are you watching HANNAH MONTANA? (on another screen) Him:  No. Me:  You're looking over there. Him:  I was just looking around. Me:  I can't wait to post this in my Yelp review. Him:  You better not, I was just looking around. Me:  Okay, I won't.  I can't wait to go again!

If you are looking for a detailed review of the sushi here, I can't help you.  I am not a sushi eater.  You may tie me to the whipping post now.  My husband, however, LOVES sushi.  He would like nothing better than to live in Japan again.  And I will say he is very impressed with Dozo.  Since our relationship is not all about me, I allow him to take me to dinner here once for every 20 times I make him eat Mexican food.  And I admit, I always enjoy it too.  They have a great menu in addition to sushi.  I always have a combination which is tempura with your choice of entree.  Fantastic tempura every time.  I've tried the katsu chicken, terriyaki salmon, and plum chicken as well.    Service is excellent.  The servers actually seem to appreciate your business and the sushi chef always thanks us as we are leaving even though we're not sitting at the sushi bar.  Relaxed, casual atmosphere.  No need to ho up to come here.  Very enjoyable.

As far as appliances go, this Sears has more on the floor than just about any other Sears or other appliance store I've been to.  Their regular prices are fairly consistent with Best Buy or the home improvement stores.  However, Sears almost always has some kind of promotion to bring the price down.  Where they beat the competition hands down is delivery time.  We purchased a washer/dryer set and two other stores that carry it required 10 and 21 days to get it in.  While Sears' warehouse is in California, we were still able to arrange for delivery in two days, and that was with purchasing it at 9 pm.  My only complaint is they charge for delivery unless there is a promotion, which there wasn't yesterday of course.  Most other places we visited had free delivery, via rebates, on major appliances.  Boo to Sears for getting that extra $65 on top of the $2300 we were already in for.

I've only been to two theaters since moving to the Valley.  Although I live closer to Harkins at Fashion Square, one experience there was enough for me.  I find this theater relatively clean and free of screaming brats.  That's about all I need to be happy.  I've never noticed the gas smell in the parking garage or encountered the broken escalators, but my husband always insists we take the stairs.  As if that's going to counteract the bucket of popcorn and 55-gallon drum of Coke!  Getting out of the garage can test your patience, though.  Beware of the lunatics whipping around the corners oblivious to the concept of driving on the right side.    Best time to go is the 10 am showings on Fridays.  Garages are empty, theaters are empty, and it's only $5.  Now you have just enough money to buy a candy bar with the change from your twenty.

What a great little find!  My first impression was positive when we were asked if we had been in before.  Upon learning we had not been, TSM (the sandwich man) proceeded to welcome us and tell us about their product.  Almost everything is made from scratch.  Salads, soups, desserts, even the condiments are house-made.  They roast their own meats, too!  The only thing I'm not sure of is bread.  I don't think they make that.  They've got a ton of options on the menu, but if you can't find anything to suit you, order whatever you want.  They also do catering.   My husband and I split a "Rubens Place."  Maple turkey, roasted red pepper, cole slaw, and swiss on rye.  Damn that was good, and I only half-way like a ruben to begin with.  Soup that day included some concoction with chicken and poblano chiles.  Damn that was good, too.   Perfect lunch spot or easy dinner.  Might want to consider "to-go" because the place is pretty small, although there's a little outdoor space, too.

When Qwest discontinued Choice TV which I loved, it was the dilemma between DIRECTV and Cox. While DIRECTV would offer me a bundling discount with Qwest (we can't have Cox internet for some reason my  husband understands), I hate the whole 2-year contract deal and their unwillingness and inability to answer a simple question.  Call them and you'll get someone who knows nothing except how to present a sales pitch.  So Cox and their overpriced service won.  First off when I called to inquire about setting up service, I asked about incentives.  I gotta hand it to the guy, he didn't pitch me the merits of Cox.  Instead he told me Cox isn't big on incentives.  At least he's honest.  He offered me a small discount for the first 2 months and agreed to free installation when I asked for it.  However, he couldn't set up the order and put me on hold.  When he came back he told me his supervisor confirmed they could offer the discount or free installation, but not both.  I ended the call and went to their website.  The website had a promotion of a bigger 2-month discount AND free installation, but ALL the promotions listed expired in May or June.  I did the instant live chat and asked why they can't manage to update their website.  They had a web sales person call me and I got the promotion which really hadn't expired.  She did tell me you have to go through web sales to get the specials.  Stupid.  So we needed cable cards which have to be professionally installed.  The guy arrived at 2 pm and left at 8!  After the first couple hours, he called a second guy over.  The two of them together couldn't get them to work.  They called several other people before they had it working.  But as it turns out, the free Variety tier is not on.  So now I have to call again to make sure I don't start getting billed for it 2 months from now.  And I'm also prepared for a bill for the "free" installation with some convoluted explanation.  But I can cancel any time, and that's a plus!

While I've been forced to use a "master bath" with hideous seashell wallpaper for 3 years that can't be removed without popping that can of worms, my husband has been obsessed with getting our roof re coated.  Undoubtedly because we're taking a huge risk of water damage with the torrential rains we get on a regular basis.  I finally gave in and agreed to get it over with.  And by "get it over with", I mean listen to my husband talk about it for another 6 months before he got around to doing something.  We obtained 3 estimates, and I was shocked that the highest was nearly twice the lowest.  Now everybody knows to never pick the lowest, but in this case, it was also the company that came with a recommendation from our neighbor who is anything but cheap.  First off, Rick came by to do the estimate as scheduled.  Middle guy called to tell us he didn't show up when he was supposed to.  I'm pretty sure I already knew that.  Rick gave us a written estimate and advised our foam was in good enough shape, he would offer a 3-year warranty rather than his standard 2-year.  I don't get the whole foam roof concept.  How can "foam" possibly work to protect my house.  When you put styrofoam in a microwave, it melts, and Phoenix gets hotter than a microwave.  Two men came to do the work, and they were done in a few hours.  Rick did stop by near the end of the job to write up the invoice and inspect the job, or I assume he did.  He reminded us to call him once or twice a year for an inspection, and any needed repairs (bird holes?) would be done free of charge.  One of the workers came to the door to collect payment.  Though his English was not great, we didn't have a problem beyond he didn't know if they accept credit cards.  I assumed if he didn't know, he also wouldn't know how to write it up, so I did have to pay by check.  I'm a fan of the price for now, but won't know the full results for 3 years I guess.  Maybe by then I'll have a nicer bath.  In the meantime, you'll find me on the roof admiring the workmanship there.

Attention South Scottsdale:  Fry's Grocery store looking for customers.  Must meet at least one of the following criteria, preferably more than one:  1)  Willard Scott must have wished you a Happy Birthday at least once. 2)  You must prefer to ride around on a motorized cart not because you are disabled, but because you are at a comfortable weight of 350 lbs. 3)  Must be willing to hold up the pharmacy line for an eternity discussing every ailment you and your cousin Ethel have ever had, and have no knowledge of insurance whatsoever. 4)  You must steer your cart as bad as you do your Buick in the parking lot. 5)  Must consider the middle of a shopping aisle a suitable place for social interaction and bingo. 6)  You must be a cheap ass and appreciate Fry's prices are lower than nearby markets.  Sadly, I fall into the latter category.  See you next week Fry's.

Now that my kitties are in their golden years, I am more comfortable utilizing a pet sitter rather than leaving out the "all-you-can-eat" buffet.  I have used Polly's 4 or 5 times now.  Although I believe they have overnight sitters if you choose, I opt for a once per day visit ($22).  They try to ensure you have the same sitter each time if available, not that my cats have any interest whatsoever in bonding with said sitter.  Sitters are screened, bonded and insured of course.  A meeting with your sitter and prepayment are required the first time you use their service.  After that, you can schedule by phone or internet and just leave payment, assuming you leave keys with the sitter.  They require 2 keys, one for the sitter and one for the office just in case.  Visits are 30 minutes I believe.  During that time, you can request mail be brought in, plants watered, pet waste disposal, etc.  The sitters will leave a diary of the time spent with your pets and the duties performed.  They must be honest because the entry is the same every day for me "both cats sleeping, Suzi enjoyed the attention, Jasper appeared thoroughly disgusted and would not purr."  Yep, those are mine.  They actually don't say anything negative.  They find some redeeming quality to compliment your pet on.  I was a little apprehensive at first about having a stranger in my house, but I was put at ease immediately upon meeting my sitter who I find very professional and a true animal lover.  And when you think about it, your own friends and family are probably more likely to snoop through your crap than someone who doesn't know you anyway.

Still the same excellent service, and we've been fortunate to have the same sitter each time.  My Big Sexy had a tumor removed several months ago.  It appeared to be all good until last month when it seemed to resurface.  The plan was for an oncology consult after our vacation.  But Big Sexy is all about making our lives difficult in his old age as we, of course, have made his life miserable for the past 16 years in his opinion.  Yes, I am qualified to speak on his behalf.    You guessed it, the day before our vacation, there's a massive swelling.  Crap.  Infection?  We were frantically trying to get his vet to see him, but what to do about the sitter situation.  We were set up for a daily visit, but unsure if he would need further medical attention in our absence.  The cat already is on a medical regimen that includes pills, oral liquids, and transdermal meds.   So I called Polly's to ask about my options.  Charlie was beyond understanding.  Although our usual sitter only works on a limited basis, he agreed to assist our sitter with additional visits as needed and even wait for our mobile vet if an appointment was required while we were gone.  As it turns out, a daily antibiotic was prescribed and Big Sexy was big and sexy when we returned, just as we left him.  We knew both cats were well taken care of as neither was angry when we returned, nor exceptionally pleased to see us!

If I were my sitter, I would have quit by now.  I've spent the last several months trying to plan two vacations next month as my husband has to take his sabbatical in September or lose it.  But much like Big Sexy did, Miss Suzi (aka Lulu aka The Lu) has other ideas about vacations.  Her blood work earlier this month showed she needed to begin fluid therapy and injections, frequency to be determined and adjusted as we go.    Although I had decided to have a vet tech come to our home on the days treatments are needed (requiring coordination between the tech and the sitter), both Charlie and Jen, our regular sitter, did offer to learn the techniques for sub-Q.  But after Suzi's recent seizure, I've been up in the air about whether to increase the number of daily visits or board her, assuming she recovered.  Again, they have been super understanding about my waiting until the last minute to determine what is best for her.  Well, we're scheduled to leave next week and have decided not to go at all.  I'm not comfortable leaving her home alone and 12 days is too long to board her.  It came down to what's best for Suzi or what's best for my husband.  The cat won...again.  There will be another sabbatical in 4 short years, and hopefully I'll still have a husband.  There won't be another Lu.  But a huge thank you to Charlie and Jen for doing everything possible to accommodate our situation!

As soon as my in-laws announced their plans to visit, my husband started making plans.  Not because he's a planner, but because he didn't want to sit around and "talk" for a week.  Uh, they're his relatives.  Regardless, I got a nice jeep tour out of it.  Wild West provided front door service and a great afternoon!  Our guide was entertaining and knowledgeable.  I even learned a few things about Arizona I didn't know!  The area we toured was beautiful, especially since it was Spring and we were not on the verge of a heat stroke.  The ride wasn't too bumpy, so even older folks will enjoy it.  I can't believe I just used the word "folks."  Another example of youth gone by.

Hey, someone answered the phone!  He had to take a message for the person who does the scheduling, but she actually called back, too!  I was fit in the same day for someone to come out and deal with a slow drain.  She did warn me if it was more than the drain, I would have to be rescheduled for the following week (it was a Friday).  The plumber told me up front it would be $125 to attempt to clear it, regardless if they were successful.  If not, they would have to go in through the wall.  He also offered the name of another company that could do a drain clean for $50.  Since I had already gone through a couple weeks of waiting for other highly-rated Yelp plumbers to call, we opted to just have City Wide try.  Five minutes later, I had a fast running drain.  However, prior to calling City Wide, we broke the tip-toe drain stopper trying to unscrew it.  Apparently this requires a whole new drain assembly and a hole in the wall.  Although I was pretty sure I didn't want to spend the money on my crappy old bathroom, they were to get back to me with an estimate.  I confirmed that before the plumber left, but I never heard from them again.  I won't pursue it at this point.

They did call today to apologize for not following through on the estimate.  Not only do they read Yelp reviews, they actually care about customer satisfaction!

If you dare to venture into the hood of south Scottsdale, and I mean way south (you know the scary part where you may find a stray cat, but never a cougar),  you'll find Huauchinango Mexican Grill and me most likely stuffin' my face.  English is a second language here, both on the menu and for some of the servers, but it's not enough to keep me away.  First stop, we ordered a total of 4 tamales, a taco, and a side of beans for about $8!  Even if the food tasted like crap (and no I don't have first hand experience of what actual crap tastes like, but I can imagine), it would be a good deal.  But guess what, the food is great!  All the tamales were on the hot side, but the green was the milder of the three I sampled, and my favorite, too.  I've also had both the carne asada and carnitas tacos and I couldn't have stopped eating long enough to complain if I tried.  They're small street tacos on soft corn tortillas so order a bunch!  So head over, grab a seat (they'll take your order from the table if you like), and prepare to feast on a dime.  Word of warning, prepare to smell like the grill after you leave and don't be surprised if you're given a plastic spoon to eat with.  Regular flatware one day, only a plastic spoon the next.  If I could reliably get a real fork, I might "fork" over that 5th star.

Expensive, but so worth it!  My husband and I took a sunrise flight to celebrate my 20th anniversary of my 21st birthday.  Other than having to be at the airport by 6:30 am, it was great!  Mike was our pilot (yes, they do have to get a pilot's license or "balloon driver license" as I called it).  Prior to lifting off, he comically gave us the rundown on what to expect, especially at landing.  An "A" landing is touching down like an elevator stop (not likely to happen today), a "B" landing is the basket skipping a few steps and a little bumpy (what we would most likely experience), and a "C" landing is not so pretty.  Our basket only held 8 passengers in 2 compartments.  I was thankful since I was not looking to share the ride with 14 people!  As we were lifting, it was cool to see all the other balloons above and below you.  We drifted and rose to an elevation of over one mile.  Does that make me a member of the mile-high club?  We spotted an abundance of rabbits and a coyote below although another balloon supposedly spotted a bobcat.  Our landing was the real entertainment.  Didn't get that "B" landing thanks to the wind picking up.  Instead, our basket landed on it's side so that our compartment was against the ground (we were essentially lying on our backs now) and the second compartment was above us, taking out a path of trees and vegetation along the way.  It was better than any 6 Flags ride, and we all laughed through the whole thing, while we prayed the partition between compartments didn't collapse.  I was never really frightened, maybe because I never heard our pilot yell "oh shit," or anything like that (although I did see a diamond drop out of his pants).  He did tell us later that the baskets don't usually land in any position other than upright.  We were greeted at landing with mimosas and a fabulous little breakfast catered by Vincent's.  We were also presented with flight certificates.  My husband had let them know in advance of the occasion, and they had a breakfast cake for me as well.  My only wee little complaint was that they should give you the souvenir champagne flute instead of charging 5 bucks for it considering the price of the flight.   As Michael C noted, they were very nice and professional.  And I, too, felt very safe, considering...In all seriousness, the trees we hit were used to help us stop, and it was a controlled landing, I think:)

I hate to give something related to Boys & Girls Club less than 3 stars, but I just wasn't impressed.  While BGC is a great organization, my first experience with them was with the flyer they leave at your house announcing the next date they will be in your neighborhood to pick up.  I left my stuff curbside with the flyer as requested and the truck never came by.  This could explain why the thrift shop was not so great.  The thrift shop is okay, but the pricing scheme is completely off.  For every item that is priced appropriately, there are two that aren't.  I know it's a charitable organization, but I'm not going to pay near retail for someone else's crap when  I can go to IKEA or Target and get my own brand new crap for almost the same.  Amidst all the crap, however, my mom managed to find a big pile of non-crap that she's "going to make a profit on."

It was Asian weekend at my house last week...not a taco in sight.  There's a first for everything.   We opted to have dinner at Noodles Ranch and dine in.  The restaurant was busy on a Saturday night, but we were seated quickly.    That was the only thing quick about the experience.  Actually, our orders were also taken quickly, but service went downhill from there.  Our spring rolls arrived, and I had to ask for napkins as there were no utensils on the table.  The food runner almost looked confused and brought over a few pathetic scraps of paper usually found in a dispenser.  So I was off on a rant over that...especially when I looked down and saw a full-sized sucker on the floor.  I guess we weren't worthy.  Food took forever, but when it finally arrived we realized again we had no utensils.  My husband spotted some chopsticks and took matters into his own hands to retrieve them.  No one ever came by to check if we needed anything, and my husband who by now should have put an apron on, found soy sauce for me.  The check arrived slowly and without an offer of dessert.    Why four stars you ask?  Because I really did enjoy the food.  The spring rolls were okay, but our entrees were great.  My husband ordered a special of noodles and yellow curry with chicken.  The curry was spicy and flavorful.  I was sort of jealous.  I had the Yakisoba with seafood. They skimped on the shrimp, but there was plenty of chicken and pork (the pork was my favorite anyway) and lots of veggies.    Will definitely return, but maybe only for take-out.  If we dare eat in again, I hope the service is better...don't make me strip another star off of my review!

I was always a customer of Allstate until I got married, and we got better rates elsewhere.  Once we bought a house, that changed and we were back to Allstate, but still using our agent in Flagstaff.  After calling my agent to complain about rate hikes, I was advised there was nothing that could be done short of dropping coverage.  Oh wait, I was told there was an additional discount that she could have applied to the bill I just paid, but she never did that.  I called Misty's office for a policy review when I had had enough of my Flag agent.  To my surprise, there was a lot that could be done.  I signed up for electronic billing and auto withdrawal (which I could still use with the pay in full option) and my rate went down substantially.  Misty also went through my coverage with me and new plan options that are available resulting in better coverage for us without a bunch of extraneous benefits we don't really need.  As to be expected, my husband had an accident with a tree shortly after increasing our deductible and dropping rental car coverage, but now that that's out of the way, we can start saving money.  And I can attest that Allstate really does have excellent claims service.

My agent really does deserve 5 stars.  Not only has she saved us money, but she calls periodically to make sure we don't have any questions and are satisfied with our coverage.  And this was a new one to me...Her office sponsored a private showing of Transformers complete with gift cards for snacks and prizes from Crate and Barrel.  The catch?  There was none.  No spiel about a new product or upping your current coverage.  Just a free movie as a thank you.  Who does that? Terrific office!

With Valentine's Day around the corner, now is the time I start warning my husband NOT to buy me chocolates.  Somehow I believe that giving them up is going to miraculously result in a 20 lb weight loss.  One can always hope.  This year is different.  After sampling these delightful confections at the DBG Chile and Chocolate Festival, I was hooked.  At the time, I sampled an itsy bitsy bite of the passion fruit chocolate, I was sold.  I wished I had a trunk full of disguises readily available so that I could eat each and every morsel on that tray.  It was too early to buy chocolates for the holidays, but we did go to the boutique at the Montelucia a month later.  I'm sure the valet appreciated parking our vehicle with it's sweet scent of our Chompie's leftovers in the back seat.   We selected several different boxes for ONLY the people I thought would appreciate such exquisite chocolates.  Anyone that I've witnessed shoving an entire chocolate in their mouth with 2 chews at best was off the list.  That left a small list which was great for me considering these pricey little gems.  And despite my faint-hearted protests, my husband smartly insisted on choosing a box for me.  There are actually only a handful of selections, but truthfully, the flavors are so brilliant, you will not need any more.  My favorite is the passion fruit, followed closely by the French caramel truffle.  I usually don't even like caramel, but this toffee covered truffle is filled with the creamiest caramel you can imagine.  The boutique is open every day, until 10 pm Wed-Sat!  We had the pleasure of meeting Julia on our visit and she let us know they offer chocolate and wine pairings as well!!

Normally, I wouldn't give 5 stars to a place this loud, chaotic, and not exactly spotless.  But it is the day before Christmas Eve and half the city was in there buying tortillas, tamales, etc, including yours truly.  Of course, I had to have lunch too.  I had the 3-way burro (red, green, bean) so that I wouldn't have to choose which way to go.  All I can say is that if this what a 3-way is about, I'm in Mr and Mrs Carolina, and bring enough tortillas to cover a king-sized bed!  Those are damn good too.  I seriously need to find a reason to be in this part of town more often.  Oh, and some may have heard me gripe about so-called "cheap" Mexican food.  This really is cheap.  Tacos for $1.75, $3.25 for a burro, and I found a penny in the parking lot!

Think you can't afford an interior designer?  Don't be so sure.  My husband and I bought some furniture (impulse buy) less than 9 months ago and have been sorry from the day it arrived.  Funny how fabric on a 6-inch swatch looks totally different on a large sofa.  After many arguments and fruitless hours looking for just an area rug, we were left with only three options.  1.  Divorce with a custody battle over who had to take the furniture.  2.  Take up smoking so we could accidentally set the sofa on fire.   3.  Hire an interior designer.  The least costly of the three.  We went with the latter, and it was the best decision we could have made.  I found Suzanne on a Google search, not the preferred way to find a designer, but we lucked out.  She is flexible and will provide as much or as little guidance in the design process as you would like, anything from just a consultation on paint color to actually shopping for and purchasing the furnishings, the route we chose.    Suzanne is fast, too.  Within a week of getting our painting completed, she had purchased and arranged for delivery of all of our new furnishings (she also used what we had already bought).  We were not allowed to see the room until it was completed, just like on HGTV.  I used to think the shocked look on the homeowner's face was well-rehearsed, but my husband and I could not believe it was the same room!  And although we had the option to return anything we did not like, of about 30 items she chose for us, which included everything from furniture and accessories to lighting and artwork, we returned one piece.  And this is from someone who thinks they need self-check return lines.  She was always mindful of our budget, which was probably pathetic by Scottsdale standards, but you can't tell by the finished project (I have posted a couple photos).  She also offers redesign services, using your existing stuff in new ways.    As for the area rug, we love what she chose.  Unfortunately, so do the two destruction machines that sneak out every night to claw it.  We're hitting PetsMart this weekend for devices to scare the crap out of them, wait I don't need that on the rug either!  I'm sure the puking on it will come sooner rather than later.

While you all stand in the infinite line at the Old Town Farmers' Market for Simply Bread, I'll be looking for Breadsmith.  Not that there's anything wrong with Simply Bread.  I just detest lines, especially lines filled with stroller totin' moms that want to sample everything themselves as well as feed it to their kids.  If I'm lucky, I made it to the market before the Greek Olive Ciabatta is gone.  This ciabatta is FILLED with olives, and whole olives, not "chopped up so you can barely detect it's an olive" olive.  Unfortunately, most days I'm left with what's still available, maybe a rustic Italian or Freedom Bread.  But I'll take it, thank you!

I know it's shocking, but I had never been to any Whataburger until a few months ago.  I've now been to this location twice.  The first time was after 9 pm, and we ate inside.  The burgers and fries were both pretty darn good.  The gal who brought us our food and offered condiments was very pleasant, too.  I really have not one complaint.  The second time was a complete fiasco.  22 minutes in drive-thru.  I tried not to get irritated as the end result would be a really good burger, made-to-order.  Well if this burger was made-to-order, I wasn't the one who ordered it.  I will say it was assembled-to-order, however.  Not only was it cold, but the cheese had never been melted and the lettuce & tomato were still refrigerator cold.  So assembled-to-order with an already cold patty.  The fries were only slightly better.  So my relationship with Whataburger was incredibly brief and is over...unless I'm hard up late night.  Then anything's possible.

Anyone who is losing their hearing but refuses to use a hearing aid will assume everyone else is deaf and speak at about 200 decibels.  And, of course, 300 decibels is required when talking on a cell phone which is perfectly acceptable in public.  Coco's, I would like you to meet my stepfather.  He will be dining with you whenever I'm involved.  Feel free to provide consistently crappy service.  Judging by my last two visits, that shouldn't be a problem.  I would say the food at this location is generally decent.  And I would say the servers are generally friendly and pleasant.  Unfortunately, it will take repeated attempts to get your order right.  I asked a server once if he thought he should write our order down.  He jokingly said no, then came back 5 minutes later to say he forgot what someone at our table ordered.  He did a nice sales pitch on the sweet potato fries, then brought regular fries anyway.  But, he was so personable I didn't hold it against him.  On my visit last week, four tries to get the breakfast order right.  Supposedly caused by a manager insisting on helping the wait staff by bringing out orders.  Seems more like an attempt to turn tables quicker.  I guess it backfired.  End result...not  a bad place if you're willing to wait or eat what they bring you, rather than what you ordered.

My husband and I lived together for about 18 months before he threw my laptop in the trash and made me order an iMac.  Being in IT himself, he somehow didn't appreciate coming home every night to a bitch- fest about Windows.    Now I had virtually no issues with that iMac for 5 years, except a bad DVD drive.  I took it in to MacMedia under warranty and they had it back to me within a day or two, never a problem again.  When my husband dumped an entire cup of coffee on his one-year old PowerBook, we learned they are not magicians.  But they did offer to send it in to Apple, and were honest that it would be several hundred for Apple to look at it, and the likelihood it could be repaired was next to nothing.  I've known for a while now I need a new computer (wipes tear away).  Five years is like 50 in computers apparently.  But once you go Mac, you never go back.  As my husband gets an employee discount with Apple, we were expecting to have to buy online or go to "that other store."  Nope, MacMedia came through.  I priced out my new system online, emailed the Apple quote to MacMedia, and Louis honored the same discount, no hassle, no fuss.      See you in a few years guys, I'm not letting my husband anywhere near my iMac with a drink in his hand.

The first time I came to this store was right after my husband and I bought our house.  We were doing some pre-move in work and starving.  This was the closest grocery store.  We dragged our tired, filthy asses in looking for something that required no plates, no utensils, and no effort.  When we walked in, it was like a bright light washed over us as the angels began to sing.  I could get away with never turning on my stove again.  What should I choose?  Chinese food from the little place in front (I can never remember it's name, but the food is pretty good), a wood-fired pizza (not bad for the price), Mexican food (also not bad-HUGE burritos with your choice of fillings), something from the hot deli perhaps (pork tenderloin, salmon, roasted chicken??).  I wiped a tear from the corner of my eye at the possibilities all in one location.  We gleefully skipped to our car, giddy with eating something other than 99 cent menu items from Jack in the Box that week.  And though it was June, our car was not 145 degrees because they have covered parking too!

Okay, in reality, the thrift shop is probably 3.5 stars, but how can you deny 5 stars to a cause that tries to undo the effects of man's stupidity.  Spay and neuter your pets people, and for the love of St Francis, stop treating your pets like property and disposing of them when they get too big or they become a little destructive, or you move!  Does that work with kids?  "Hello, orphanage.  I'd like to turn in little Betty.  We thought she would stay a baby, but we caught her coloring on our walls, and now we have to rent an apartment that won't take her."  End spiel.  I've actually donated to the thrift shop a few times.  In fact, on this trip, I took several boxes of stuff and while we wandered the thrift shop, it was already being unpacked in the back.  Not sitting in the box for the next 3 months.  So, some good stuff here and some not so good stuff like any thrift shop, and prices are appropriate.  As I understand, they also have an eBay store where donations of more substantial value are auctioned.  And I love that this shop has a pretty large pet section where you can buy food, supplies, and toys (all new) at a decent savings.  Great for people who need the savings and for those who would rather pay the Humane Society for a new collar rather than Walmart.  I do wish they had a pick up service, however, for large donations.  But I understand it's costly.  Such a great cause that I think I'll go through my husband's stuff and downsize him!

I don't have a sweet tooth, I have 28 of them.  That being said, my husband and I stopped by on a Tuesday afternoon, and were sorely disappointed in the sparse selection-maybe 4 or 5 varieties at best.  I had the "Tuxedo" (chocolate cake with vanilla frosting), while my husband tried the Rich and Famous (chocolate on chocolate).  We both found the cake to be average.  The vanilla frosting was plentiful and satisfyingly sweet.  The chocolate frosting was another disappointment, lacking that "oh my god" factor you hope for in a chocolate dessert.  Even more disappointing we would soon find out is the customer service.  My husband attempted to special order a cupcake creation and was rudely told "we don't do that."  He tried to explain all he wanted was a "cake" assembled from cupcakes arranged together and frosted as a whole.  Their response was the same.  Interesting since their website indicates they "welcome" special orders.  If your only requirement in a cupcake is gobs of frosting with a price tag to match, make the trip.  Otherwise, start baking.

Although Stax was not at the top of my list for a nice lunch, I was glad we decided to try it.  Simple menu of 3-oz sliders with some more unusual  meat choices in addition to beef  (ostrich, buffalo, lamb, salmon...), salads, sides, and a few desserts.  I was surprised to find a full bar.  Layout is like a contemporary diner with the bar taking the place of a counter.  I tried the turkey burger which was actually a little dry, but with grilled pineapple and fresh guacamole, I really didn't notice.  I found one to be enough with a side dish.  My husband had an ostrich slider and a kobe beef slider-he liked them both.  Selection of toppings is huge.  We also had red potato salad which was okay and sweet potato fries which were excellent.  We tried the key lime stack for dessert.  Not really pie, not really cake, sort of like a layered cheese cake, not bad but a little disappointing.  Service was excellent.  We ordered chipotle aioli but received ketchup by mistake.  To compensate, our server brought a platter with a sampling of all their aiolis.  Very nice gesture.  The manager also stopped by our table to make sure everything was to our liking and to thank us for coming in.  The only thing that may turn some people off is they bring the dishes as they are ready-so salad came out first, fries next, burgers last.  I enjoyed the little courses, but if you have to have the fries with the burger, ask.  Otherwise, you'll have a lonely little burger on your hands.  Will definitely return to try the Mac n Jack I was drooling over at a nearby table.

Great Indoors is really great if you just want to look.  Fantastic selection of everything you could need and want in your home.  Unfortunately, that's where it ends.  Their prices are far from great.  I expect any brick and mortar store to have higher prices than online retailers, but I have found their sale prices are still higher than what you can pay if you're willing to wait a few days and know what you want.  And forget service.  It's virtually nonexistent.  Recently, we have been in several times as we're updating a bathroom.  I'm pretty sure the bathroom will be outdated again before it's finished, but that's another story.  We asked for pricing on a mirror.  Over 20 minutes later, the "sales" guy returns stating he can't find anyone who knows.  No offer to take our number and get the info to us, just "sorry, I don't know."  Lighting?  No better.  I asked if a fixture on display as an uplight could be mounted as a downlight.  The lady confidently replied, "no, xenon lights have to be mounted up."  Interesting, since we later noticed the same  fixture in a hanging model in an adjacent area.  Not to mention their own website pictures the fixture as a downlight.  Returns?  Forget it.  Said light fixture shorted sending sparks flying and melting the screws.  When we went to return it, there was some big issue made of the fact they need the box from the new fixture to send the bad one back.  Okay, would a bag be too much to ask for?  Yes.  My husband ended up assembling the new fixture at the counter.  When he handed a blown bulb back to the lighting patrolman, the guy remarked "oh, maybe that's why it shorted."  Yes, we all know that every time a light bulb blows, you need a fire extinguisher nearby and an American Express card handy to replace the fixture.  And if that's not enough to dissuade you, we also purchased two different drawer pulls.  The gal scanned them as two of the same item.  When we went to return both, it was a fiasco since "they couldn't make the return on the one that wasn't scanned because their inventory would be wrong."  Uh, isn't it wrong already?  Wouldn't the return actually correct the inventory?  I can't even imagine attempting to do a major project through this store.  But how I love to look at all the pretty new ranges and showers.   Even if I have to put up with my husband begging me to sit on a toilet and pose for a picture.

I have to say I loved Su Vino!  First off, it's very unpretentious.  I'm not very knowledgeable about wine, so I tend to shy away from places that have an attitude.  We  also had one of the 1000 outstanding Groupons about to expire.  And in spite of the fact that just about everyone coming in that evening had a Groupon, the staff was fantastic.  As they do not have a kitchen, all appetizers are cold, but we had a nice cheese plate which included 3 cheeses, olives, nuts, grapes, and dried fruit.  My only complaint was that the lahvosh-like crackers were really oily and not good at all.  Lose those and it would have been much better.  As for the wine, it was actually better than I expected.  Although I don't generally care for really sweet wines, both the Summer Rain and Peachy Keen were really enjoyable.  I just think of them more as a crisp summer beverage than wine.  I was surprised to like the Pinot Grigio as much as I did and may have purchased a bottle, but it was not available that evening.  The Miscela, an Italian blend, was a miss for me (too acidic for my taste), but the Malbec was better.  For after dinner wines, the Grande Finale was over-the-top sweet.  I would probably not drink more than a tasting.  The Porto Cocoa, however, was fantastic.  I generally stay away from Port because I dislike the "brandy burn."  But one whiff of this and I was hooked before I tasted it.  While it's not like terribly sweet, you definitely get the essence of chocolate.  We bought a bottle to take home, in fact, but I only saw one wee little glass.  My husband apparently mistook it for a Yoo-hoo and drank the rest.  Great place to begin your evening!  And because many of these young wines are sweeter, even my non-wine-drinking husband enjoyed it.

In lieu of completing a real review from my ever growing list of unfinished reviews, I guess I will do my second update of the day where removing a star is of the utmost importance for my sanity.  Thank you Lowe's for selling me a $69 shower head that cracked after less than 3 weeks.  I realize it's not your fault the product is a piece of crap, but if it weren't for Evelyn working the returns desk, I might not have been reminded how much your store sucks.  Seeing as Evelyn never cleared the counter after helping the last gentleman (and believe me, anyone that could deal with her and not punch her in the face must be a gentleman) and continued to screw around with the returned product, we politely waited for her to finish whatever it was she was doing.  Eventually, we were greeted with an obligatory "Are you ready?" in the tone of voice that more closely matched "What the f*** are you waiting for?"  She processed the return without apology or courtesy or even a thank you at the end, but at least it was quick.  Only my husband being Mr. Nice Guy couldn't leave it at that.  He was concerned the water that had leaked from the shower head might spill out of the bag onto the counter, so he attempted to call attention to it only to get a response of "Don't worry about it" which more closely resembled "Why the f*** are you still here?"  So thank you Lowe's for reminding me why we will not be utilizing your store for any substantial remodeling needs.  And thank you, Evelyn, for proving to me once again that in spite of a supposed rough economy, apparently anyone can get a job.

When Christina P entrusted me with choosing the location for some good wine, good food, and good company, it was like choosing the location for my Last Supper. I used to drive up and down the same main street in Flagstaff for an hour before settling on one of only about 5 choices.  I did finally settle on Centro Paninoteca due to some positive Yelp reviews.    I was startled at how small it is upon walking in, once I found it tucked in off the street.  But I like small and comfortable and this fits the bill perfectly.  Unfortunately my first 3 wine choices were not available as the wine list is outdated.  But rest assured, I did end up with a drink in hand.  In fact, I had a drink in my other hand, too.  We ordered the fig and gorgonzola appetizer and were surprised it was a pannini, but man that was good.  The gorgonzola melted into almost a cream sauce and the the sweetness of the fig was the perfect complement to a blue cheese.  Not to mention, it's pretty good with the wine, too.  We also shared a roasted ham and provolone pannini.  The addition of roasted green chiles added the spiciness I have to have in almost every meal.  Since my husband is not a wine drinker, we usually don't go to wine bars, but I was happy to report to him they have a full bar and he can go comfortably in his finest t-shirt and flip flops.  Centro Paninoteca may just give me a reason to venture north of Indian Bend after all.

Yet another place I would never have found without Christina P and Yelp!  And it was good.  Really good!  The menu has quite a few recognizable items like burros and tacos, but I opted to try a huarache, basically an over-sized tostada with a thicker, softer corn tortilla and you choose your toppings.  Let's just say it's 8:16 am and I wish I were eating one right now.    They don't serve alcohol, but they do have a great juice bar with many options to choose from.  Of course, that won't satisfy anyone who can't fathom the idea of a spicy meal without a beer or margarita.  But it worked for me.  I will definitely come back if I'm in the neighborhood.  I just need to find a reason to be in the neighborhood now.

I don't claim to be an expert on good BBQ.  In fact, I didn't eat much of it until I married my husband, a southern boy.  I've since learned what I like and Lucille's is not it.  We stopped in for lunch while running an errand at Marketplace.  First, the lemonade.  I have a sweet tooth, but this was ridiculous.  Does the owner have stock in C&H?    It was very tasty once it had watered down by the end of my meal.  Next, biscuits.  Tasty and doubles as a hand grenade it you attempt to split it open.  Fried green tomatoes.  Not bad, but could have been called "name that vegetable."  Kind of bland.  Potato salad.  I love a good potato salad.  I didn't have one yesterday.  Way too much dressing.  Maybe the same person that controls the sugar in the lemonade prepares the potato salad.  I shouldn't be able to eat just the potatoes and have enough dressing left in the bowl for another salad.  Finally, the BBQ.  I had the pulled pork sliders.  I made the mistake of assuming the pork was served dry as there was sauce on the table.  Wrong.  Okay, I can live with that.  On a positive note, the sauce was sweet and spicy and carmelized nicely.  But, it completely overpowered the meat.  What I really didn't like was the big globs of fat in every slider.  There's not much meat in a slider as it is.  Maybe that's why they call it a "slider."  The fat just slides down your throat.   Since everyone has a different idea of what makes good BBQ, I wouldn't discourage anyone from trying it.  I do highly suggest lunch rather than dinner as a starting point.  We payed half as much for me to determine I'm not interested in coming back.  What about dessert you ask? Just have the lemonade.

Finally made it to Bomberos for an after-dinner glass of wine.  I was really surprised at how small the place is!  I love that!  And the patio is so nice we opted to sit outside.  Seemed like a good idea at the time..until we realized it was 95 degrees outside and the breeze had died down.  But I enjoyed my glass of white wine.  I couldn't tell you what it was beyond something South American.  Glasses average $10-$12, so it is a little expensive, but I would gladly return.  Can't wait to try something from their menu next time!

I would say my husband is the "Lucky Boy" with a wife who is more than happy to dine at such a fine establishment.  You won't find kobe beef or antelope on the menu, nor some crazy topping like foie gras.  And brace yourself, no sweet potato fries either.  But you will find a pretty damn good burger and fries for under $4!  Who knew they still even existed?  The burger is everything an old-fashioned burger should be, standard with mustard, ketchup, chopped lettuce, tomato, and onion.  And just so you don't forget we're in Arizona, they offer pepper jack cheese and green chilies.  The fries are thick cut and crisp, and they mix a mean milkshake, too.  We ate inside, and yes, it is kind of a dive, but a clean one.  It reminded me of the kind of burger joints that were around when I was a kid.  Yes, they had burgers back then.

I tried Z's last month while on a hiatus from cooking.  It was great, except when you're eating out 7 nights a week, it better be cheap.  Z's fit the bill.  I was a little hesitant when we arrived and no one was there, but having read Jim W's updated review, we went in anyway.  Nothing special inside except the food.  It was surprisingly good!  I was especially pleased they serve the fat, cushy pita bread, rather than the thin, tough bread that doubles as cardboard.  The hummus was quite tasty, even if it was lacking the garlic and green olives when served FEZ style.  The chicken souvlaki pita was full of better than average chicken and fresh veggies.  No wilted lettuce, green tomatoes, and brown onions here.  I loved they have a drive-thru, but I recommend going inside if it's slow.  The poor girl at the counter looked bored out of her mind and genuinely thrilled to have a customer.  Hopefully, that's not the norm because I'm a fan of Z's!

It's just ridiculous I have not bumped Z's up to 5 stars yet.  Never have I had a complaint.  The pita is perfectly cushy, yet toasty.  Veggies are crisp and fresh.  Chicken (I always get chicken) is wonderfully flavored and devoid of all nastiness that can come from a chicken.  There.  5th star.  Well-deserved.

I met my yelper buddy Dottsy for happy hour before a show at the Herberger.  This was my first time and hers as well-at the restaurant.  I arrived about 15 minutes early but decided to get a table and start on a cocktail.  I may as well have waited outside as the server was absentee.  When he finally arrived, he did apologize however.  We ordered the lobster lettuce cups and sweet chili calamari.  The lobster cups were chunks of lobster meat, avocado, and a veggie slaw-really good.  We ordered the calamari at the server's suggestion.  I am not generally a huge fan of calamari, but this was soooo gooood.  Perfectly cooked, and the sweet chili sauce was just enough to give it a little zing, but not overpower the dish.  And the serving was HUGE, and I'm an eater.  I was sorry we didn't have time to finish it.  I considered dumping it in my purse, but not sure the other theater patrons would have appreciated that.  Happy hour prices are great as well.  I think our bill came to $30 for a glass of wine, a specialty drink, and the two appetizers.  Definitely four stars for happy hour in spite of the slow start.  I'll have to try dinner next time.

Yum.  I could end my review there, but my mystery "fans" might be disappointed.  We had a late lunch on a Sunday afternoon, and the place was almost empty.  I'm glad about that because I didn't care for the layout of the dining room.  Unless the room had been set up for a large group that had left, with the exception of counter seating and a few four-top pub tables, all the seating was 2 long rows of small tables placed about 6 inches from each other.  Although it does make it easy to set up tables for groups of any size, I'm not fond of sitting on a stranger's lap generally.    We started with a small caprese plate with house-made burrata, pesto, cherry tomatoes, balsamic, and ciabatta toasts.  We were starving, so we devoured it pretty quickly, leading the server to comment "you finished that already?"  Yes, we did, it was a small, and it was delicious.  But I appreciated her not outright saying, "wow, nice job fat-ass."  Next up was the potato and roasted garlic pizza with fontina, gorgonzola, leeks, rosemary, and the addition of prosciutto.  My husband insisted I choose the pizza, and I loved every bite of it!  And the best part was I loved every bite of it because he didn't.  So I generously suggested he order another pizza knowing I would have it all to myself.  He went with the pepperoni.  Although they are very generous with the pepperoni, it's still just a pepperoni pizza.  The sauce was a little sweet for me, but I prefer a spicier sauce.  Can't wait to come back and try the pistachio pizza.  And for the record, no soggy crust!  Suffice it to say...Yum.

I hate this Walmart.  I hate the fact the last time I needed help finding something, the "associate" didn't speak English, although she was very nice and found someone who did.  But since that person could not have cared less to help me, I was back to square one.  I hate the fact there are people begging for money in the parking lots.  Hello!  I'm at Walmart.  Think about it.  I hate the fact it takes like an hour to find anything.  And most of all, I hate the fact that my husband and I  spent $4 on gas to look for diet Dr. Thunder because it's 33 cents cheaper than diet Dr. Pepper-and they only had four of them anyway!  Huh-now that I think about it, maybe I belong there.

I really must do my Yelp reviews sooner.  I had a terrific lunch with Audrey W at Indian Paradise several months ago.  We opted for the buffet.  Although I cannot remember exactly what was offered, I do remember there was plenty to choose from and everything was hot and delicious.  Fresh naan was brought to our table as well.  I also remember the staff was a little too nice.  We didn't realize they close between lunch and dinner and continued to chat away after their closing time.  No one said a word and no looks were thrown our way.  In fact, we didn't realize they were closed until we went to leave and noticed the door was locked..and the restaurant was empty.  It was good conversation:)

As the reviews run the gamut, I was prepared for anything.  It is Restaurant Week, so it was really busy, and the initial service did start off a little slow.  Our server, however, was apologetic and overall the service was above average.    I ordered beets & citrus, and it was delicious.  However, the portion size was fairly small.   Although I wanted scallops, I steered clear based on "overcooked" reviews.  For my entree, I had the raviolo-again, not a large portion, but very good.  The goat cheese and tomato filling melts in your mouth.  The outer edges of the raviolo were a little undercooked.  I like my pasta al dente but this was a little tougher.  Dessert was the lemon mascarpone cheesecake with honey and candied pistachios.  Although I didn't detect much of a lemon flavor, it was GOOOOD.  And the best part, served with a side of strawberry/rhubarb compote topped with a scoop of gelato.  Score!  Like two desserts for the price of--well almost two desserts at $9.00.  The only thing that was not so enjoyable was the sound level.  It was as loud as a college bar, seriously.  I had to almost yell to carry on a conversation.  Poor planning in the design phase in my opinion.  The food was good enough that I will definitely return if I can find out when their slow times are.  The noise level was too much otherwise.

Scratch may have the best french toast I've ever had!  With a little caramelization on the edges and served with fresh berries, it was like breakfast and dessert rolled into one. But such a large portion, even I couldn't finish it, and that's sayin' something if you know me.  Definitely enough for two ladies to share.  I was a little confused coming in, but if you're eating in, grab a table and they will take your order.  The pastry case seemed a little empty, but we arrived about 15 minutes after they opened.  Still it surprised me they didn't have any croissants ready.  That's when we decided to order off the menu.  Since I didn't try a pastry and it is Scratch Pastries, I'm holding the 5th star until I try one.  I'm thinking an eclair is in my future real soon!

I actually came across Stewart's when looking for a place to do a full detail on my old car, but I had ruled it out for car washes when their website only listed a deluxe wash for $50.  I could wash it myself for that much...I didn't say I would, just that I could.  On my way home from the movies today, I remembered Abu J had told me about a place that does hand car washes.  I didn't even realize they were the one and the same until I went in to pay.  Not all the washes are $50.  They start at $4.99!  $4.99 for a hand wash, can you believe it?  Being the big spender I am, I splurged on the $12.99 deal which included vacuuming, windows, etc.  I really don't even know what the difference is between this wash and the $50 one, except maybe $37.  I guess the deluxe wash is more detailed?    In any case, for $12.99 I have no complaints.  Sure, there were a few water spots, but if the cheap washes are this good, I'm sure their detailing services are well worth the price, although they do seem on the high side to me.  So thanks, Abu.  My new car is new again!

Where else can you view "fine" (read expensive) art while eating a funnel cake strolling through gardens amidst the "live art" parade of Scottsdale Plastic People.  Not to knock Scottsdale.  I live here, and I love Old Town in particular.  I had not been to the festival in a couple years, and it seems to have gotten bigger.  Many medias are represented, and you can actually find some quite affordable pieces.  Of course "affordable" is relative.  Perhaps you can afford a $7000 bowl.  Our favorite painter from last time, Richard Hall, did not show this year unfortunately.  However, we did purchase a few pieces from an artist, Larry Fielder, who creates wood vases and wall pieces.  There was also an on-line auction this year.  Many of the artists showing donated a piece to benefit the Scottsdale Center for the Arts programs.  I was going to do my eBay style sniping, but forgot!  Only knocking a star off for the food vendors.  I would like to see more and better options for this type of event.  The crepes were nice, and gelato found its way to me.  But the wild Alaskan salmon burger was terrible, not cooked to order, cold in fact.  The only other options I recall were BBQ (had it last time-just okay), philly cheesesteak, and gyros.  And the funnel cake, of course, which I did resist.

I guess I'll never know from personal experience if Maria Maria worked out the kinks.  We stopped in this evening and were told it would be 10 minutes for a table.  Not a big deal, but why a wait at all?  There were at least 10 empty tables in view that were ready for seating.  During our wait, we noticed the other couple ahead of us finally get seated at a table that had been empty from the time we arrived.  What the hell is this about? Make your customers wait so you appear busier and more desirable than you actually are?  No thanks, we left.

So much for my commitment to consume fewer carbs.  I think this pasta could single-handedly kill the already dying Atkins industry.  I first tried Decio pasta at an event at the Botanical Gardens, and was happy to find them again at Old Town Farmers Market.    This pasta is air-dried and cooks in half the time of ordinary dried pasta, and it's unbelievably flavorful.  With varieties from Artichoke hearts to Wild Mushroom, you can get your veggies out of the way.  Well, not really, but it's as close as I get most days.  The first time I tried a sample, I asked what was in it and couldn't believe it was only a little of the cooking water and a tablespoon or two of butter.  While the directions (which I never bothered to read) do recommend you rinse this pasta, I never did and never needed to.  But I did find I should have done so with the lemon pepper.  I'm not sure why this was so much starchier than my favored spinach, basil, and garlic, but it was definitely too sticky.  At  $6 a package (4 for $20 at the markets), this is one of the best inexpensive meals you can find that doesn't end in "berto."  And who can't boil water?

I second the five-star rating here.  We came to look for an indoor tree, and they had a very nice selection and a trillion pots to choose from.  Very impressive selection of fountains and any other garden items you may need.  All the plants looked great!  Nothing worse than seeing dying plants at a nursery.  If they can't take care of them, I would have no hope.  David helped us and was very knowledgable.  Gave us all the info we needed on necessary lighting conditions, water requirements, etc.  He helped us determine the right size pot we needed and set us up with the styrofoam we needed to put in the bottom, plastic saucers, etc.  The nursery's owner rescues macaws and other birds that need homes.  Since the birds live at the nursery, David had some very amusing tales about the birds and their habits.  We will definitely be back and ask for David next time we have garden needs.

So as I'm walking the aisles of Walmart, I'm contemplating what has become of my life.  I should have been sipping a cocktail at a fabulous Sunday brunch.  Perhaps I should have been in a little mountain cabin somewhere escaping the heat.  But no, here I am at Walmart, wearing a free t-shirt lamenting about how fat I've become, while looking for TV dinner trays.  Did you get that?  TV DINNER TRAYS.  Because my husband does not want to sit at the table situated 3 feet from the sofa, and he's tired of my eagle eye waiting for him to spill something.  Deciding that I deserve better, we left Walmart and headed for Target.  This Target is generally clean and not too busy.  Pretty much my only requirements for a Target.  We found the trays, perhaps I should call them modular furniture, and wouldn't you know it..all of them were scuffed.  And my husband points out the ones at Walmart match our living room better.  Uh, we are NOT going to be leaving them out I remind him (now anticipating the arguments to come).  So I took them to customer service to see if they had any unscuffed ones in the back, they didn't.  Remembering that Donald S' beautiful Carin got a discount, I asked for one, too, and was quickly offered 10%.  I took it remembering full well that the beautiful Carin was given 20%..nothing like a little salt on the wound.  Moral of the story.  This target is clean with pleasant, accommodating employees for the most part, and easy to maneuver since it is not the circus of a Walmart.  And they offer discounts...based on appearances.

If Eddie's House ever rents a room, I'm moving in!    4.5 stars, but I think I'm too stingy with that 5th star sometimes.  Fear of commitment maybe?  I had dinner here with Dottsy Z before the infamous night at Brackin's, right there is a good start to a 5-star evening.  We sat at the bar and started with a glass of wine.  Nice wine list.  By that I mean not too overwhelming for a novice.  I'm no wine expert.  If I can get it down easier than a shot of Everclear, that's good enough for me.  As appetizers are half off in the bar during happy hour, we went with three.  I was hesitant with the tuna tartar nachos.  If it walked, flew, or swam prior to being on my plate, I want it cooked.  But, I was pleasantly surprised. The tuna was seasoned so well, I enjoyed it.  The toasted seafood wontons are a take on the crab cheese puffs at most Chinese restaurants, but oh so much better.  I could have eaten a dozen of these bad boys.  Too bad there were only 4 and Dottsy actually expected to partake as well.  The horseradish mashed potato stuffed shrimp rounded out our trio.  I can't say I had ever had a shrimp stuffed with mashed potato, and I'm sad about that.  The shrimp were large, plenty of room for stuffin', and it was quite a tasty dish.  I believe you get 4 shrimp as well.  Hold on, we're not done eating.  We also ordered two half dinners.  First, the famous "What's-In-This" Steak.  Here's a hint:  steak.  This is Eddie's version of a shepherd's pie.  The mashed potatoes were well-seasoned and the steak was exceptionally tender.  Finally, we tried the seared diver scallops with apricot goat cheese risotto, my favorite of the evening.  Scallops were cooked perfectly, and the risotto was spectacular.  As far as the appetizers, they really only serve 2, or 1 if you're me.  So sit in the bar if you'll order several as they are a little expensive.  And be careful of the half dinners.  While the steak would be enough for me, a half order of scallops was only 2 scallops.  So unless you just want a taste, go with the full meal or try two different entrees!  This little gem is in my neighborhood, and I'm kicking myself I hadn't visited sooner, but I look forward to going back!

Just had dinner service for the first time.  Excellent service.  Excellent food.  We tried the grilled lamb chops with cumin hummus for an appetizer.  I usually won't eat lamb, but did take a taste, and damn those were good.  It's too bad for me those little lambs are so adorable before they're slaughtered.  Also tried the tiramisu for dessert.  Ladyfingers are replaced by cookie dough!  I think I'm in love with Eddie.  SHHH.

So I have literally convinced myself I cannot lose weight because of a thyroid disorder, to the point that I have a doctor's appointment next week.  Yet I find myself at Sweet Republic ordering not one, but two scoops and a bottle of coke.    I have wanted to try Sweet Republic for quite some time, but just hadn't managed to get there.  Now I'm sorry I went and sorry I didn't go sooner all at the same time.  I tried the ever popular cheese course duo.  I was really surprised that the blue cheese flavor came through so well, although I don't know why since it is blue cheese.  I would have preferred to see small bits of dates mixed in, but the flavor was definitely there.  For my second scoop, I went with the salted caramel.  I'm not saying it wasn't delicious, it was.  But I was hoping to get that little bit of salt here and there...you know how when you bite into a cookie, sometimes it's just sweet, but sometimes you get that little pinch of salt?  That's what I was looking for.  I really didn't detect the salty/sweet combination.    It's great that the shop is laptop friendly since my husband seems to always be on call.  Love the contemporary, yet warm decor.  Nice, CLEAN bathrooms as well!  And the best part...my husband works across the street and they have containers to go!  Now if only he would answer my calls.  And if you know my doctor, please don't tell him I was here.  Wait...is he on Yelp?

How can you go wrong with tortillas and pastries in one location?  I honestly don't understand how this little Mexican bakery stays in business  given everything is practically free. My hubby and I bought two empanadas for me (like a little pie or turnover), flan for him, a dozen tortillas, and 2 red burritos.  I guess you need to get there early because they were out of red tamales at 2 pm on a Friday.    The empanadas were baked just to golden brown and the crust was so flaky and delicious words cannot describe it.  I had lemon and cherry, but I wanted to try one of everything.  The red chili in the burritos was mild but very flavorful.  Luckily they are wrapped in foil because I couldn't wait to get home to devour mine.  They could double their prices and I would still come back!  I forgot to mention the bakery is spotless, so clean I would eat off the floor if I had to.

Thanks to the cable guy being a guest in our home until 8 pm last night, we missed the Yelp event.  So in an attempt to undo also missing a previous event at Taj Mahal, we decided to come here.  Typical strip mall restaurant with minimal decor, but it was clean and pleasant.  It surprised me to see a bar off to the side and India's version of MTV on the overhead television.  There was only one other diner in the restaurant-good for me, bad for them.    We started with the garlic cauliflower.  Loved it!  For my appetizer I went with the ever popular chicken tikka masala...chicken, onion, and bell pepper in a tomato based sauce.  You can choose heat level up to 10.  I prefer spicy, but mild dishes with just a hint of heat.  Ordering a 1 fit the bill.  The garlic naan was probably the best I have had of the 3 or 4 places I have been to.  For dessert we had gulab gamun, fried cheese balls soaked in sugar syrup.  I had never had this before, so I have no basis of comparison, but I didn't really like it.  I guess I expected it to to be cheesier and crispier and to be served hot (it was warm).  Oh well, can't win 'em all.  Our service was great.  I would have been disappointed had it been anything less with no one else in the restaurant for most of the meal.  I can see Taj Mahal being a somewhat regular stop on our rotation.  They just need some more customers...well when we're not there anyway.

Well, I did it again.  I made the mistake of taking my husband with me to Tempe on his empty stomach.  After our errand, there was the elephant in the car.  His blood was boiling, he tried to deny it, but you could cut the tension with a knife.  He was hungry.  And although I'm not a huge fan of Thai food, Thai Elephant was right there.    The restaurant was clean, staff was friendly, and the food was quick and tasty.  I tried the Elephant Garlic with chicken.  All the veggies were super fresh and still crisp, and the chicken had no suspicious looking or "discard" pieces in it, as Ryan C likes to say.  Although I'm not a connoisseur of Thai food, it more than adequately met my criteria to make me a fan!

When you can't be with family, or should I say, when you're stuck with family, I can think of no better place to have had Christmas Eve dinner than Amarone.  With the music and strolling guitarist, it's not the most quiet restaurant, but it's certainly a lot of fun.  The decor is a little confusing with the giant bar in the middle, but what a great place if you're dining alone or just a couple!  I don't know who waited on us, but I'm guessing possibly the owner, or manager, based on his demeanor and the fact I could hardly understand half of what he was saying with the heavy accent.  Good sign!  I understood enough of the specials to pick up on "scallops, shrimp, and gorgonzola sauce over pasta."  Enough said for me.  Absolutely delicious.  My dining companions had the brazed lamb shank, pork chop milanese, and pollo parmigiana.  There was not much talking once the food came with the exception of comments about how great it was.  Dessert?  Had to skip it.  After having Christmas cookies for breakfast and lunch, I was done with the sweets, but I'll be sure to order next time.  I might have considered 4 stars because my scallops were perhaps just a little over cooked, just a little, but when the complimentary shots of Sambuca arrived, all was forgiven!

Hands down, my favorite pizza ever!  I can no longer imagine anything better than Lorenzo's White pizza.  This super simple pie of ricotta, garlic, and mozzarella won me over at first bite, actually at first sight once I saw the size of it.  I owe a HUGE thank you to my husband that could not us.  Had he showed up, he would have insisted on your standard red sauce pepperoni pizza, although I have a sneaking suspicion Lorenzo can conjure up a pretty good pepperoni pie, too.    Even mister red sauce had to admit the leftovers were pretty darn tasty.  And the garlic knots?  Pure doughy deliciousness.  And Shannon M, you displayed the ultimate act of friendship prior to abandoning Arizona, by hooking me up with Lorenzo.  I might need to buy your house just so I can live closer to him!

Decided to take a road trip from south Scottsdale and have dinner downtown.  Within walking distance of our next stop, District fit the bill.  I was really impressed with the design of the restaurant.  Great windows, lots of trees, inside and out, nice patio complete with a hungry kitty I spotted.  I was surprised by the lack of customers on Saturday night, but it was Halloween.  I decided to try something new and not have a meal before the meal, so we skipped appetizers.  They do serve bread before the meal, but it's just a standard dinner roll that really should be served warm, but isn't.    For my entree, I had the cedar roasted salmon with risotto.  The salmon was served on the plank with crispy shallots.  The preparation was simple, no special sauce or anything, but the fish was cooked perfectly.  The risotto was filled with shrimp, asparagus, and parmesan cheese.  Although maybe just a little on the salty side, it was delicious.  My husband had the lobster pot pie.  When it's presented, you will think it's ginormous, but it's really just the puffed pastry.  Once you pop it, it's a manageable portion.  We opted to share a dessert and went with pecan pie spring rolls.  These, too, were served on a plank with a caramel dipping sauce and bourbon chantilly.  Quite good, although I thought the plank made it awkward to share this dessert.  And speaking of sharing, you may want to ask about portion size before opting to share.  Our dessert was three small rolls that was perfect to share if you just want a little something sweet.  But if you expect to completely indulge, might want to order your own.  Unless, you're going to stick with the complimentary cotton candy at the end of the meal.  If they had a carousel out front, you could save a lot and skip the fair!  As far as service, it is a little slow.  But it's slow as in "relax and enjoy your evening" slow, not "where the hell is my stinkin' food" slow.  And the server did ask if we had a theater performance to catch, so it appears they make the effort to ensure you're out on time.  Definitely worth coming to again sometime!

Finally made it to Salvadoreno the night of the Sunnyslope art walk!  Although it had been only a few hours since lunch, I made the sacrifice to eat again.  A sacrifice everyone should make.  Since I wasn't too hungry, my husband and I shared the Salvadoran sampler.  Well that backfired because the sampler was huge.  Two different pupusas, fried yuca, chicharron, empanadas, a tamale, plantain chips, and dessert!  I had never had yuca and was surprised to find it tasted similar to a big french fry!  The pupusas and empanadas were fantastic.  And I could eat the plantain chips and salsa all day.  The only things I didn't care for were the tamale (I didn't like the masa-it's much creamier than the typical Mexican tamale) and the dessert (on the outside it looked liked a chocolate donut, but had a filling I didn't care for).  But that's the beauty of a sampler.  If you find something you don't like, move on to the next thing.  Overall, I'm a big fan of Salvadoreno and would happily eat there again anytime!

After my first experience with The Mission, I didn't expect there to be a second, at least with my husband anyway.  But after sampling the stew at  Yelp in Bloom, he was open to giving it another shot.  And this time, it did not disappoint either of us.  I have to give 5 stars for the Primarita.  I was hesitant given it has something like half the calories of a standard margarita.  Half the calories and twice as good!  A couple of these and I can almost forgive the price of the guacamole.  After Yelp in Bloom, we had to order the Almejas Al Vapor, that delightfully spicy peruvian stew.  Definitely enough for two and served with plenty of bread to soak up all that broth.  That tends to help keep patrons from drinking from their bowl I'm sure.  We also tried the tostadas prepared with chicken thigh and black beans.  Delicious, but maybe piled just a little too high.  More stuff ended up on my plate than in my mouth with every bite.  Maybe they should line the plate with a tortilla so I could just roll up all the stragglers at the end.  Less forks to wash that way, too.  The grilled street corn was right up there on the good scale with everything else, as well.  Only knocking a star off because everything really is priced just a bit too high IMO.  But this time, I'm sure we'll be back!

2007 Just bought our house.  Husband cleaned all the windows! 2008 Me: Let's hire a window cleaner. Him:  I'll take care of it (cleaned several months later). 2009 Me:  Let's hire a window cleaner. Him:  I'll take care of it (still waiting). 2010 Him:  Let's hire a window cleaner.  Finally!!  Thanks to Gabi and Violeta for posting their reviews of Novice, we called Lyndell.  We were scheduled the following week.  The day before our appointment, Lyndell called to reschedule because rain was forecast.  Nice touch that he keeps an eye on that.  Wouldn't it just suck to get your windows cleaned and have it rain the next day, you know, rain for the first time in 6 months of course.  We were rescheduled for a Saturday at 8 am.  By 9 am, we hadn't heard from Lyndell and called.  He was running late and was there by 9:30.  Only knocking a star off because he didn't call to let us know, and since it was our first time, we weren't sure if he forgot us.  But the windows looked fantastic by the time he was done.  All cleaned inside and out, screens cleaned as well.  In fact, my dad came to visit the following week and asked "damn, how do you keep your windows so clean?"  Just goes to show, most people don't notice a dirty window, but they will notice a clean one!    And for the price, we can afford to get the windows done several times a year!  And no more of me cleaning the inside, husband cleaning the outside, and arguing whose side has all the smudges left on it!

Never met a cupcake I didn't like.  And sadly that's the truth.  I can find something positive in even the worst cupcake.  Take Hostess for instance.  I like to eat my icing last.  Hostess is great for that since it's easy to just peel it off the top, even if you then want to throw it away.  Now finding the Mr. Right of cupcakes is a little more difficult.  But then I met Butter & Me.  And the "Me" is referring to me.  After having the opportunity to taste these fine confections at many a Yelp event I was enamored.  But after having a full-sized model at Old Town Farmer's Market (chocolate with tangerine buttercream), I can say "DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET ONE OF THESE BAD BOYS."

Thanks to Chris L's first review, OTFM has been on my list of places to go for quite some time.  Unfortunately, I just can't seem to get my act together on Saturday mornings.  Today was the day.  I was ready by 9 (am, not pm)!  After a quick stop at the ATM, we were there, Yelp canvas bags in hand, and not disappointed.  I had to get that chocolate cherry bread from Phoenician Bakery.  I sampled an itsy, bitsy little piece and it was still like heaven exploded in my mouth.  We also purchased zucchini bread, honey (which I've already mixed with some mascarpone cheese and slathered on strawberries), grapefruit marmalade (yum), dates, and fresh flowers.  The breakfast burritos from Gil's Taste of Taos were some damn good burritos.  Saving for next time...fresh produce (the lines were already long for McClendon's and I'm not one to wait for veggies) and everything else I wanted (like tamales).  We saw our own Gabi K's other half wandering down the street too...he looked so lost without her:(  Hope he brought her some flowers.

So glad I finally got to try Tuck Shop and with two of my favorite Yelpers too boot!  Once I finally figured out where it was, I loved the warm and cozy feel.  Equally appropriate for date night or girls night.  Don't tell my husband, but girls night is usually more fun--they like WINE!!  And sharing means sharing, not I get one bite before it's gone.  We had a few small plates, and none disappointed.  I was surprised to find myself loving the arancini, but it's amazing what these folks can do to rice.  And the stuffed dates with chorizo and gruyere?  That's sweet, spicy, creamy, and salty all rolled into one exceptional bite.  Also on the menu, mac 'n cheese for Shannon M (as if I didn't partake in this mini masterpiece) and a juicy steak with mushrooms and creamy mashed potatoes.   Deciding to  watch our calories, we shared only two desserts..pear upside down cake and a brownie.  I would say both were "edible."  And no need to even wash the plates.   So, yep, I'm a fan.  A big one!

Had lunch here Saturday afternoon.  If you have ever been to First Watch when it was here, you would not recognize the interior.  The building has been completely remodeled to give a cozy lodge feel.  I'm talking Scottsdale cozy lodge keep in mind.  There's a double-sided fireplace at the entry-electric, not wood-burning, but still a nice touch.  Lots of comfy chairs and booths.  They were playing a variety of music, but probably more 70's rock than anything else.  The menu is pretty standard bar fare.  Appetizers include everything you would expect-wings, cheese sticks, nachos, soft pretzels, etc.  There are a nice variety of salads and sandwiches, including bratwurst, meatloaf. and philly cheesesteak.  That about sums it up.  The menu doesn't change at dinner, although we were told they have a breakfast menu on Sundays.  There are also $3 drink specials and 1/2 price appetizers for happy hour.  The steak salad looked tasty, but I had the portobello mushroom sandwich with blue cheese.  An herb aioli, lettuce, and tomato completed it.  Overall it was a good sandwich but didn't knock my flip-flops off.  I think there could have been more inspiring toppings other than lettuce and tomato.  I had sweet potato fries as my side.  They were crispy and delish.  Most items on the menu were under $10, practically unheard of in Scottsdale.  Service was excellent, other than a period in between drinks and the server taking our order.  She seemed to disappear for a bit, but was attentive afterward.  I love that there is a new option in Old Town for good food and drink at great prices and no need to ho up!

It took me way to long to get to Daily Dose, and it's taken even longer to get to my review, but my one resolution this year is to get caught up!  Stopped in for lunch with my husband since we were already parked nearby.  While the restaurant is fairly small, we were there at an off hour so no wait at all!  We shared the cobb salad and the ancho chili reuben.  They initially brought one salad and the sandwich was split for us.  I foolishly assumed the salad was to be shared until a second one came out.  Are you kidding me?  How big are these salads?  Pretty darn big, and pretty darn good.  Plenty of bacon and blue cheese, and no skimping on the avocado either.  Unfortunately, they don't come in half sizes which is too bad if you're not sharing because I can't imagine being able to finish one (and I can eat) and leftover salad just doesn't work.  Not to mention it's not easy for me to order a salad to begin with.  I have good intentions, but as I open my mouth to speak, something like "chimichanga" comes out instead.  The reuben was good, but a little dry.  Next time I'll ask for extra dressing on the side.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying that french toast Julia T raves about!

Too many restaurants, too little room in my pants.  Although on my list, Fogo De Chao had taken a back seat to other less deserving establishments it seems.  Not forgotten, just cast aside for the time being.  I hang my head in shame at that now.  I could not resist the abundance of tempting offerings at the salad bar.  Since I could not possibly try everything and still eat meat, I opted to sacrifice everything green.  I filled my plate with cheeses, smoked salmon, prosciutto, roasted veggies, and everything not in the leafy green category.    At the table, I could also not resist the fried polenta and fried bananas.  And those little popovers!  Since they were small, I didn't count how many I consumed.   Leaving little room for the meat attraction, what I did sample was tender and flavorful.  Big thanks to Gabi and the wonderful staff in the front and in the kitchen who made sure we were taken care of from start to finish.  Once I recover, I'll be back for more!

I've had two experiences at Fogo.  One with a very large party and one with a party of four.  Both the service and food were consistent.  For anyone new to Fogo, it's a fixed price (about $45) for salad bar and all you can eat meat (beef, pork, chicken, lamb).  Start with salad bar (save room) and flip your little card to green when you're ready for meat.  A parade of servers will offer their wares, say yeah or neah and wait for the next.  Flip card to red when you don't need service.  Salad bar is fantastic.  I can't resist the smoked salmon, mozzarella balls, and apple salad.  In fact, on my second trip, I loaded up so much from the salad bar, I skipped the meat entirely.  I'm also particularly fond of the polenta and bread (which is more like a popover).  Based on my first experience, some of the meat offerings are better than others.  But since you can have as much or as little of anything as you would like, try everything.  I can also recommend the papaya cream for dessert.  Don't worry you won't have room.  It's light enough that you can make room.  As far as service, it is excellent.  As soon as you flip that card to green, servers are there.  The only complaint on both visits is that they do ask if they can bring you a particular cut of meat, and then they don't follow through anyway.  It's not like you'll go hungry, but it can be a little annoying.

Thanks to Yelp's Cocktail Society, I was introduced to J & G Steakhouse.  I haven't had the pleasure of a meal in the dining room, but I have had appetizers in their beautiful lounge a few times.  They have a lovely shellfish platter, and I love their mac 'n cheese.  Not as big of a fan of the calamari, but it's only because I like a very crispy calamari so I forget I'm eating squid.  They actually choose to have the flavor of the calamari come through.  My husband LOVES their oysters, however.  Unfortunately, they are priced per oyster ($3+) and he will order at least 2 dozen.  Drinks are expectedly pricey, too, but very good.    So don't go to the bar expecting to get out cheap, but you will get out happy.  And the last time we were there, the kitchen came out offering comped desserts.  I guess they saw our bill before we did:)

Brackin's is exactly what Scottsdale so sorely needs.  A nice, friendly neighborhood joint to grab a drink for less than $10.00 (way less) that is unpretentious, warm, and inviting.  You don't even need fake boobies or cougar attire to get in, although I doubt you would be turned away!    I came with my husband for the first time for a Yelp event organized by Donald S.  Our own Michael C was not behind the bar that night but enjoyed the evening with all us Yelpers and made sure Brackin's knew to expect us.  This place is small!  But with the two patios, we were set.  The owner, Doug, treated us like family.  Our server, Renee, ran her little butt off and we were never without a drink in hand.  And the best part, clean bathroom!!

My husband came home and announced we were going to a chocolate and wine class at Avalon in a few weeks.  I don't know that I need to take a class to eat chocolate and drink wine, but I was amazed he actually set something like this up!  I later learned it was his buddy's idea, so thank you Derek for bromancing my husband!  I decided we should check out Avalon beforehand as a possibility for dinner the same night.  Situated across the street from a strip mall on McDowell, I wasn't expecting much.  But the gorgeous fountain out front gave me hope.  When we walked in, I was in love with my surroundings.  This is probably one of the most beautiful restaurants I have been in lately.  Dark wood, glass tiles in shades of blue, beautiful lighting...this is exactly how I want to design my home...not that anyone should really care about that.    I ordered a breakfast quesadilla which included cheddar and smoked gouda cheeses and was topped with an avocado pico de gallo.  It was far too much for one person, even when said person is me.  I also ordered a side of rosemary herb potatoes which were really flavorful, but a little on the salty side.  My husband had the farmer's market frittata which included artichoke, grilled asparagus, and havarti.  He really enjoyed it as well.  The best deal of brunch was the mimosa.  A split  of champagne and a small carafe of fresh orange juice for $9 yielded nearly 3 drinks!  Since I'm not a huge fan of breakfast/brunch, I will definitely return for dinner soon.  As it stands, I completely agree with Andrew F in that it must be the location that has kept Avalon under the radar.  Although this may not have been the best brunch I have had, it was certainly better than many places that seem to be much busier.

We had dinner before the wine and chocolate event, and I was not disappointed.  We started with the warm brie en croute.  Of course it was delicious.  How can you go wrong with cheese and pastry?  Scratch that, I just remembered the goat cheese I pulled out of my refrigerator the other day.  You can go wrong, but they didn't.  I also had the roasted beet salad with port wine braised figs and shallots.  I loved the combination of flavors, but would have liked just a little more vinaigrette.  For the entree, I chose the Crispy Pacific salmon fillet.  I wouldn't say the salmon had anything special about it, except the crispy top.  It's normally served with braised brussel sprouts which I opted out of.  I had brussel sprouts once.  I made them.  I threw them all away.  They were the most foul-tasting thing I ever had.  I have since learned that happens when you overcook them.  Who knew?  Instead I substituted roasted asparagus.  I was a little disappointed the asparagus was in pieces rather than whole stalks, but it was cooked perfectly.  The toasted orzo that accompanied the salmon was fantastic, however.  Price-wise appetizers are $10-$12, salads $8-$9, and entrees $20-$30.  Not bad at all.  I should warn you, this isn't necessarily the place to go for beer.  Nothing on tap, and when my husband ordered a second Stella, they were out.  Kind of odd.  After dinner, we had the wine and chocolate "class."  The pairings were all sparkling wines with white chocolate, milk chocolate, and dark chocolate.  All plated desserts.  The white chocolate was a petit four with a small cup of white hot chocolate.  The milk chocolate was a semifreddo with truffles.  The dark chocolate was an assortment of homemade candy bars.  The restaurant manager introduced the wines and Chef Travis the desserts.  A dark chocolate lover would have been disappointed as the chef admitted he is not a fan of dark chocolate and used only 52%.  That was great for me because I don't care for it either.  There was not much information regarding what characteristics in a wine make it pair well with a chocolate, but it was a great event nonetheless.    I look forward to more good times at Avalon (1/2 price bottles of wine and live music on Wednesdays!)...hopefully, they will stay open.  Again it was not busy, and this was a Friday night.  I'm glad I went in spite of some suspicious orange-head reviews.

I guess it's 5 stars.  It's the only one in Arizona.  I assume they stock most of the kits available now, there's a giant wall with bins of parts you can purchase by the cup (2 sizes), and lots on display (behind child-proof windows).  The store is clean and adequately staffed.  What else do you look for in a LEGO store?  Although there were plenty of kids there, they were well-behaved for the most part and engaged, not out of control little lunatics.  My husband seemed pleased-and he's 34.

I was a little nervous about what to expect.   I couldn't tell you where west Africa is on a map unless you pointed out east Africa first, much less hazard a guess about the cuisine.  But I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised.  I was with the large group of Yelpers last night.  And let's face it, we can be a difficult bunch to please sometimes.  We can also be a difficult bunch to serve, especially in a small shop such as Bantu that is probably not used to  a crowd such as ours.  Drink orders were a little tricky.  They ran out of several of the beer options.  I believe they only had once choice for red wine.  I had that, and I was disappointed that it had been refrigerated.     However, it was clear that their focus is on the food, not on the libations, and I appreciated that they were able to offer alcoholic beverages.  Although one of the servers was unfamiliar with the menu, I was impressed that Bantu actually brought in an additional server to accommodate us.  The staff was so welcoming, and the owner not only cooked his heart out for us, he paid us a visit as well.  I never once felt we were an inconvenience as I have at other events.    The complimentary fried plantains were served with a spicy chili sauce that nicely balanced the sweet, tender plantain.  I opted for the traditional groundnut stew with chicken.  It was a tomato-based stew with mixed vegetables in a rich and nutty sauce, very satisfying.  I was not a fan of the  fufu which I believe was mashed yams and corn.  It reminded me of grits.  I did try a few other bites of my neighbors' dishes and enjoyed them as well.  Upon leaving, we were able to just tell the server what we ordered and pay separately.  I thanked her for taking the time to allow us to do this and for coping with the crowd.  She remarked "we love this, it's like a big family."  That is reason enough for me to say, "yay, I'm a fan."

The Plaza is a great site for art and culinary festivals obviously.  The library is here, Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts, etc.  There are some great restaurants, too.  But the park itself is just gorgeous.  If you have never been to the Plaza when there is no big event going on, that is the time to go.  The park is beautiful.  There are so many fountains and gardens to meander around.  It is beautiful.  You almost forget it's a hundred freakin' fifty degrees in August.  Visit at night, too, after a nice dinner downtown.  We did that on Saturday evening, and it was virtually deserted.  Such a nice place to sit and remember the nice things about living in the Valley--January with no jacket required!

Well I knew I was in trouble when I was greeted by a bakery case to my right and a plate of bread and olive oil for sampling in front of me.  I had never been to The Kitchen, nor its predecessor Dish, so I was a little confused at first.  But when good food is involved, I will find a way to figure it out.  The Kitchen is a cafe and gourmet food market rolled into one.  It's broken up into "stations" that include a center deli, pizza, salads and cold sandwiches, hot dishes, and more.  You place your order at the station and are given a card to be scanned when you check out.  Want to order from more than one station?  Take your card to the next, and they'll add to it.  Check out when you're ready.  Don't forget to grab a basket because you just may want to pick up a few must haves for later.  There's also a small area for eating in and a wine bar.  I did not go back to that area, however.  As for the food, I had the grilled portobello on ciabatta.  It was bursting with grilled red onion, roasted tomato, and goat cheese.  My only complaint was that it was also bursting with far too much olive oil, from the pesto I assume.  The plate was covered in it, my to-go box for my leftover half was covered in it, my plate the next day was covered in it.  I would definitely order it without or on the side next time.  For my side dish/dessert I had the sweet potato fries.  Big thick fries nice and crispy on the outside and served with both an herb aioli and cumin ketchup.  For my second dessert, I had a key lime mousse that was delicious as well.    Cold sandwiches, paninis, and salads are $6.99;  hot sandwiches are $8.99.  Not bad given the quality of the ingredients here.  I only wish The Kitchen were closer to my kitchen!

So, how exactly do you rate your tax man?  My system is 1 star = I'm currently in jail, 2 stars = I will most likely be in jail, 3 stars = I will probably survive an audit with minimal monetary pain, 4 stars = I will definitely pass an audit, and 5 stars = the IRS would never discover what I've done and I'm driving a Bentley.  Seriously, I'm all for doing your own taxes if you're into that sort of thing.  And I did my own until I got married.  My husband didn't trust me to fill out a 1040EZ in spite of having a math degree.  I'm fairly certain the first guy we used was a scheister.  The second guy was with H&R Block-he had one eye, which would have been fine had he known anything about taxes.  I had to explain to him how to report my IRA to Roth IRA conversion.  Thomas Holly is my 3rd and final stop.  I just saw him today.  First off, he has both eyes so he can fully read the directions for the forms.  Second, he is competent, but doesn't come across as the "don't worry about what I'm doing...trust me" kind of guy.  Upon our first meeting, he let us know he is all for claiming every legitimate deduction you can, but is somewhat conservative.  Since I started working for myself, I have no desire to do my own taxes.  I can't really compare prices since he is the only accountant I have used for my business, but it seems reasonable given the number of schedules he has to complete.  His turnaround time is fairly quick to prepare the returns--usually about 2 weeks.  And I get the peace of mind that if I am audited, he can handle the IRS' questions for me.

It's that time of year folks!  Spring is in the air and Uncle Sam has his hand out (much like my free-loading Uncle Fred at every one of my birthday parties).  Whether you dread writing that check or look forward to the IRS returning your interest-free loan, it's here.  You can't avoid it.  Well, legally anyway.  The best you can do is find a good tax man (or lady) to help you keep what you worked hard for, or hardly worked for, whichever applies.  I'm happy to say Mr. Holly is still in business, proof his clients are not in jail, nor destitute, and ready to assist with all of your tax preparation needs.  As per usual, I showed up with my list of 102 ridiculously anal and sometimes irrelevant questions and all were answered.  One week later, my forms were ready.  Thom's a true professional, and I would recommend him to anyone.

This is our 3rd attempt to find a company to handle our monthly maintenance.  After about 6 months, so far so good.  This is a father-son business that also does lighting, irrigation, fire pits, flagstone, etc.  Although there may be other guys on the crew, the son (Hector) has come every time, and he does speak English.  Sometimes his dad is there, too.  When Hector is there without his father, we get good service, but sometimes small things our missed (hosing off the driveway, spraying weeds, etc).  When his dad comes, the service is excellent.  Not entirely surprising.  They are more expensive than "the guy with a truck," but they are running a business.  We have found them to be professional and courteous and far better than the last company we tried.  They brought river rock once and only charged for the cost of the rock-no extra charge for picking it up or spreading it (it was a small amount).  This last month, we had a new layer of granite spread and found that to be very reasonable as well.  We're hoping they keep up the good work!

My third and final comments barring something extraordinary, good or bad, happening.  While routine service of our irrigation system is not part of our monthly contract, we do have Nevarez repair any problems we have.  Even though I realize they don't test the system monthly, it would be nice if they paid a little more attention to the health of the plants they maintain.  And sometimes I have to remind them to do trimming that is missed.  But in spite of my nitpicking, they do a far better job than the last company we used and are always pleasant to work with.  No missed appointments and they are always accommodating if we have an issue that can't wait.  And if they come off schedule to take care of irrigation repairs or new plantings, they will still often clean up debris even though I don't expect it.   In addition to trimming and irrigation, we have also had some work done on our landscape lighting and fountain, and I'm sure we'll have more projects to come.

Great place for drinks!  Outside, you'll have gorgeous mountain views.  Inside, a beautiful space with large windows and nightly entertainment.  We stopped in twice during our brief stay.  The signature cocktails are a little expensive at roughly $15, but my Polo Club with Hendricks gin, raspberry syrup, fresh lemon juice, and egg white was a treat.  Later in the evening, we had dessert...apple tartan.  The presentation was a work of art.  So was the speed at which we devoured this slice of heaven.    Nice spot for travelers and locals alike!

Tandoori Times turned out to be an impromptu Valentine's dinner for my husband and I.  We just usually don't do dinner out on V-Day.  Not that we have anything against the big day, but my idea of a romantic dinner out does not involve 50 other couples having their special dinner at the same time.  Anywho, fondue was the plan, but I neglected to buy anything to dip into the imaginary cheese I also failed to buy.  We settled on Tandoori as neither of us had been there, just down the street from home, and we didn't expect it to be a major Valentine's destination.  I was pleasantly surprised they were offering a complimentary rose for the ladies.  Complimentary, as in free.  No dude peddling his roses to unsuspecting men who may have previously neglected the flower ritual and know they are damned if they do (like a $5 rose is going to make up for screwing up the flower thing) and damned if they don't (he's so cheap, he couldn't even buy me a stinkin' $5 rose).  Nice touch, no pressure, woman happy, all is well.  We started with the bread basket which had to be a concoction of Robert Atkins' evil twin.  It had four kinds of Naan (plain, onion, garlic, and potato).  We ate all we could and then some and still had leftovers.  I had the chicken makhani which is a tomato based curry with herbs and spices.    Perhaps a little too spicy if you can't tolerate any heat, but for me it was perfect.  My husband had the lamb vindaloo.  I tried it and it was a little too hot for me, but it was pretty damn good I must say.  We found our server to be pleasant and attentive.  I'm sorry we didn't go sooner (actually we tried, but they close between lunch and dinner) as they are moving their Scottsdale location to Hayden & Via de Ventura.  Somehow I think we'll make the extra effort to go again.  But I will attempt to avoid the belly dancing-I've got more than enough belly of my own.

I went to Doc's for a comedy show a few nights ago.  I had high hopes on walking in.  The room was really nice.  Big leather booths in the back and lots of tables, including tables for 2, with plenty of space in between them. That actually matters to me.  I don't like to be too close to strangers.  Hell I don't like to be too close to my friends half the time either, which explains a lot about my social life.  When we came in we weren't sure where to sit, but asked at the front and were told to sit anywhere we like.  We chose a booth.  Not long after, the hostess came by and asked who had seated us there.  I think maybe she would have preferred we sit at a small table, but she was very accommodating.  This is where the beginning of a night full of "I don't have my shit together" employees began.  Several parties were coming through the restaurant, but there was no one at the door to collect the cover charge.  Two gals next to us ASKED their server if there was a cover, and the server basically said "I guess not if you came through the restaurant."  They asked a second time about paying and were told "I don't think they charge cover until 11."  That makes perfect sense, right?  Charging cover after the show is over.  It made me wonder how much money was lost that night.  Our server was certainly no better.  I ordered a "honey deuce" (grey goose, chambord, and lemonade) off their drink menu.  The server looked at me confused and left.  About 10 minutes later, he comes back empty-handed and asks again what I had ordered.  At that time, we ordered dinner.  We had come pretty early (about 45 minutes before show time) to minimize service issues.  It didn't work.  Our appetizers were a little slow, but not too bad.  The presentation was very nice, but unfortunately, that was all they had going for it.  The salmon croquettes were too salty, and frankly tasted like a frozen product.  The southern shrimp we ordered grilled, and while tasty, it was just shrimp with an average cocktail sauce.  What was unappealing was paying $9.99 for 4 shrimp.  After our appetizer plates were cleared, we waited for an entree we were going to split.  And waited.  And waited.  It was pretty clear it was never coming.  Finally the server came by and told my husband something about the order, blaming the kitchen.  Blaming the kitchen doesn't work for me.  Had the server been paying attention to our table, he would have discovered the problem at least 15-20 minutes earlier.  But the Miles Bayou Chicken did finally arrive ("Chicken Breast rolled in shrimp and vegetables, wrapped with maple bacon,  crusted with black peppercorn, served with a sweet black butter rum sauce").  Doesn't that sound good?  I suggest you savor the description, that was the best part of it.   I don't even recall there being shrimp involved with this dish.  The chicken was sliced and didn't taste like fresh chicken.  It tasted more like the chicken breasts you can buy frozen that have water added.  The entree wasn't horrible, just not nearly as good as it sounded.  Perhaps the service is better in the restaurant, but I wasn't pleased enough with the food to go back for dinner.  I wouldn't hesitate, however, to go back for entertainment.  We did have a good time in spite of its shortcomings, and there is a Dairy Queen right across the street.

So after a nice day trip to Boyce Thompson Arboretum, I suggest my husband head north to Roosevelt Lake, and take a "shortcut" back to the Valley through Apache Junction via State Route 88.  Screw the GPS lady's instructions.  What does she know anyway?  Well apparently this computer bitch with an Australian accent knows my "shortcut" is only shorter in mileage, not in hours.  I soon learned State Route 88 is actually the Apache Trail, approximately 45 miles of the most beautiful scenery you will find in Arizona.  From Roosevelt, it includes about 20-25 miles of unpaved switch-backs that wind through the mountains with fantastic views of Apache Lake.  There are several one-lane bridges along the route.  Further on, you'll pass through Fish Creek Canyon (yeah, I had to look this up later).  The road hangs along the side of this high-walled canyon and can hardly be described-it is unbelievably awesome.  Other stops along the way if you choose include Tortilla Flat, Canyon Lake, and Goldfield Mining Town.  Lots of beautiful places to stop along the way (if you can find a place to pull over) to enjoy the wildflowers and many streams you may find.  Now, for the practical.  Don't drag your RV through the unpaved portion.  Don't drive like a lunatic when you can't see around the corner.  Remember, some of us are here to enjoy the drive.  If you're afraid of heights, probably not the route for you.  At minimum, take the drive starting in Apache Junction so you're hugging the canyon walls for the entire trip.  We took the drive in reverse and were cliff-side for the majority of the trip.  And speaking of cliff-side, have some courtesy for those drivers.  They can't pull over as far as the canyon-side drivers.  We spotted several areas on the cliff-side where the road has eroded somewhat.  Don't make this trip in a beater car in July or in heavy rains.  Some areas will most likely not be passable.  Have fun!

August 16, 1977.  Do you remember where you were?  If so, you're on your way to a 5-star experience.  I remember where I was...at my grandmother's house watching television when the blurb at the bottom of the screen popped up.  Elvis was dead.  What?  Couldn't be!  I seriously thought my little brother was going to have a stroke.  He was 7 at the time, and threw himself on the floor screaming.  So yes, I am somewhat of a die-hard Elvis fan.  But although I did get married in Las Vegas, it was not by an Elvis impersonator sadly.  My in-laws were already suicidal that I'm not Catholic.  Perhaps that would have been overkill.  With that said, I will agree this is more of an Elvis tribute show, where music and dance are the heart of the show, with some Cirque thrown in for fun.  Perhaps true Cirque fans may be disappointed, but I wasn't.  It was what I expected and more.  The show pays tribute to the highlights of his life through a mix of song, dance, live music, video, and some acrobatics.  The three female singers act as back-up singers to Elvis during some of the numbers.  In others, they perform solo or in "duets" with Elvis.  There are no male singers heard besides Elvis himself.  I LOVED this show and would see it again.  The theater is really nice, too.  Although we had 2nd row seats, the layout is such that unless a giant is sitting in front of you, most likely you'll have an unobstructed view of the stage.  Also, tickets do say late arrivals will be held, so get there on time.    If you're an Elvis fan, ignore all the naysayers who can't appreciate what this show was meant to be, and go see it!!

Had dinner at Rita's last night on the patio following the Yelp Cocktail Society event.  I'm starting to become a bigger fan of resort restaurants.  Number one, they have gorgeous patios, Camelback Inn included, that exceed anything you find elsewhere.  Number two, nightly entertainment.  This comes with higher prices, but I'm already a fan before I even order.  But Rita's did not disappoint in that department either.  At our server's suggestion, we ordered the fish tacos (mahi mahi) and chicken enchiladas.  The tacos ($15) were served with ranchero beans and a brown vegetable rice.  Okay, let's get the one negative out of the way.  The rice was terrible.  Dry, flavorless.  Yep, tasted like brown rice.  The tacos, made with house-made corn tortillas, were really tasty.  The fish was well-seasoned and perfectly cooked.  The beans were delicious.  But lucky for me, the best meal was the enchiladas drenched in red pasilla sauce, cotija cheese, and topped with a creamy slaw.  Best enchilada sauce ever.  However, at $17 for two enchiladas, might I suggest they include a side dish?  Preferably the beans.  And let's not forget to mention the warm chocolate cookies with ice cream.  Order it if offered.  You will only be disappointed you only get 3.  We also had the chance to have the guacamole and the chips & salsa tree at the cocktail event.  The guacamole was really good, but seeing it for $15 on the menu, I don't know about that.  That's up there with paying $9 for a baked potato at a steak house.  I would, however, fork out the $7 for the chips & salsa which is served with four salsas.  The creamy verde was my favorite, but they were all good.  As for the service.  Jacqueline was really exceptional.  There was a miscommunication on my husband's drink order (mostly his fault), but she quickly rectified it.  And then when he ordered a second old-fashioned, she took it upon herself to take the time to get it from the event bar, rather than the restaurant bar, so that he could have a second wax-dipped glass after noticing we had one sitting at the table.  She also offered to bring us a bag to take home all the stuff we accumulated during the evening.  Ten stars for Jacqueline!  And now my friends, I must go eat my leftover enchilada.  All this talking about it...

Finally made it to The Parlor for dinner.  I was waiting until it had been open for awhile and the hype had died down.  Apparently it has not as it was packed on a Wednesday evening.  Thanks to Christina P for pointing out the herb garden in front.  Very nice to know my meal was not made with dried herbs from a 5-gallon jar from Sam's Club, although I could certainly tell it was not.  I really like the interior with the exception that the acoustics are terrible, and it is really loud.  But since it's not a fine dining experience, I was not bothered by it.  We started with the meat and cheese selection, served with grilled rosemary flatbread.  You choose your own meat and cheeses from a list at $3 each.  I love that you can customize your appetizer and order as much or as little as you want.    Although they had some really appealing salads and pastas, I decided I should order a pizza.  I went with the Smokey (smoked prosciutto, olive tapenade, and ricotta, topped with arugula).  At $10 for an 8" pizza, it was not only delicious, but affordable as well.  The combination of flavors was perfect.  I really liked the pizza crust, but it was a little soft towards the center.    We ordered two desserts.  One was the special, which was a dried fruit bread pudding.  I'm normally not big on bread pudding, but I have to say this was really good.  The other was the zeppole, ricotta fritters.  I was actually expecting a ricotta filling.  Instead, they were essentially small doughnuts made with ricotta.  Still delicious and moist, served with cranberry and chocolate dipping sauces.  Service was decent, not perfect.  I certainly enjoyed The Parlor enough to make the long 9-mile drive from home for this one!

How many nice restaurants are there in Las Vegas on the strip alone?  A lot.  How many did we eat at?  ZERO!  Thanks to my husband's inability to wait 5 minutes once he's hungry and our friends who would rather spend their cash on beverages, rather than food.  So Aria's buffet was our Friday night dinner.  With unlimited wine and a lobster for every two people, $36 sounded like a pretty good deal.  Unfortunately, since we never made it back to our hotel room the night before, I was not at my best for eating.  The buffet had just about everything.  Multiple carving stations that included lamb, turkey, New York steak, pork tenderloin, and prime rib.  I had none of that, so I can't comment other than to say my companions were pleased.  Seafood options included crab legs, shrimp and oysters among other things.    The "free" lobster was a mess.  Our order was lost, so there was a long delay, and it was NOT worth the wait.  It was so overcooked, it was like chewing on a piece of rubber.  Minus two stars alone for the senseless slaughter of crustaceans.  If you can't prepare it well enough to at least be edible, don't bother offering it!

I've used Diamondback off and on for years.  With each successive move, customer service suffers.  Nearly impossible to get them by phone in any reasonable amount of time, and when you do finally get a person, they usually can't help anyway, and you have to wait for a call back which won't be timely either.  Fills are slow.  Used to be same day, but now can be 2 days.  Unfortunately, I don't what alternative there is locally.

Love Apple, but really don't love their stores.  This one is like a big old warehouse, and it was way too hot in there.  Again, I don't like their checkout system.  Too difficult to find someone to help.  I really loved when we asked the cost of iWork and were told "It's $79 but only $30 if you buy a computer."  Oh, well then hook me up with a Mac Pro so I can save $49.  But most of all, I really appreciated the "genius" leaning on the counter yawning while he ran our card.

Holy guacamole this place is good!  Why have I not been here before?  Why do I continue to frequent mediocre establishments that are more convenient?  Deciding to try something new and actually use one of my usually worthless Groupons before it expired, we made the long and difficult 6-mile trek to SMG.  I was soon greeted with chips, two full of flavor, but not too hot salsas, and a bowl of that delightful guacamole.  Granted the chips were not my favored thin, crispy, and lightly greasy chip, but they sufficed for scooping salsa and scraping the last bit of guac from the sides of the bowl...restaurants tend to frown when you lick a bowl, which is why places like SMG offer take-out thankfully.  Soon to arrive at my table would be the carne asada taco plate.  Two of the most delicious tacos I have ever had.  It brings tears to my eyes just thinking about those wonderfully seasoned morsels of beef surrounded by the best corn tortillas this side of wherever has the best corn tortillas.  Beans and rice are not just empty fillers here either.  The charro beans are worthy of a meal on their own.  I should also note I was somewhat envious of my husband's carne asada burrito which was toasted.  Living my childhood 30 miles from the Mexican border, I foolishly assumed everyone toasted their burritos (only we called them burros).  I grew up quickly when I realized the harsh reality was that this wasn't true in most parts of the world.  It's a sad reality, indeed.  Luckily, SMG knows how things should be.  We had wonderful service from the owner who reminded us that everything is made fresh.  As if you wouldn't know after one bite.

Why is it they can make frozen yogurt taste like ice cream, but can't make regular yogurt taste more like a milkshake?  Sure, the regular yogurt people concoct all these flavors like key lime pie and apple turnover, but I'm not fooled.  I'm still eatin' yogurt and am left wanting a real piece of pie when I'm done.  But the frozen yogurt people, sheer genius.  I actually almost think I'm eating soft serve ice cream.  And I think the TCBY people may have to change their name now.  Are they really the country's best?  I don't know.  The Land of Yogurt is pretty darn good.  And at a mere 30 cents an ounce, I could have a 55-gallon drum for only $2112 (did you do the math?), discounting the weight of the drum...and assuming there was a 55-gallon drum available at the counter.  If not now, there will be soon.  This is America after all...or at least it was; and we like big food, big hair, big guns, and if you're in Scottsdale, big busted women carrying even bigger designer handbags with strangely small dogs.  Lots of flavors, lots of toppings.  No complaints except the layout of the store.  The parking lot entrance opens right up into some tables and then the yogurt dispensing area.  So you've got people coming, people going, people eating, people dispensing and people waiting to dispense all through the same area.    But other than that, I'm a fan!

After reading Brian S' review of the pricing scheme at Scottsdale Auto Salon, I thought "hey, I'm going to review my favorite gas station."  Looks like Brian beat me to the punch, but I'm going to concur with his 5-star assessment.  I always went to this station when it was a Mobil, even though their pumps were crappy and always out of paper, because they had cheap gas.  Still do under Circle K, but the pumps are all new and pretty now.  But, it's still just a gas station.  It's the convenience store part that impresses me.  Truthfully, I've never looked around much.  Only stopped for drinks and lottery tickets, but I've been lucky enough to see the same gentleman working there most times.  And he is a gentleman.  I feel terrible I can't remember his name, but he is always so friendly.  Friendly as in happy with his life, glad to have a job and a customer to wait on.  Stopped in on Thanksgiving and he was so happy the day was set up in 4-hour shifts to allow employees time with their families.  I would have spent the whole 4 hours bitching about working at ALL, but not Mr. Gentleman.  And if I ever get the winning Powerball ticket, I'm going to remember him...and get his name.

I took a tamale-making class with my mom and my aunt in November.  We do this every 10 years or so to remind ourselves how to make them so if we ever do decide to make them, we'll be set.  Prior to the hands-on, the instructor provided a short demo of the all the dishes we would be making.  We were going to be making about a half dozen varieties of tamales in 3 hours and still have time to eat...I was skeptical.  During the demo, a light appetizer was served.  I suggest you not go on an empty stomach because the appetizer is not a meal, and you won't be eating until later in the evening if you take a night class.  I rarely have an empty stomach, so there was no problem for me.  Our instructor, Anne-Marie Blanco, was great.  With a diverse culinary background, including pastry, she also grew up making tamales with her grandmother so I knew we would be okay.  Anne-Marie was just old enough that I knew grandma did it right.  And in fact, we were taught several methods to make masa, including my favored lard-based masa.  After the demo, we divided up into teams of 4.  My group held out in volunteering for the red beef or chicken mole tamales, wanting green chile, so you guessed it, we were stuck with mole (along with pumpkin).  The mole was my least favorite.  But luckily we all shared.  Ann-Marie was very knowledgeable and personable, making sure everyone knew what to do and had assistance as needed.  She had two assistants to handle dishes, clean towels, etc.  The ingredients were pre-measured at each cooking station to speed up the process (and probably to reduce fatal errors).  So we were, in fact, able to complete the daunting task and enjoy a "heart-healthy" meal.  However, our class size was 15-16, and I thought this was too many given the size of the kitchen.  The class was very well-planned so there were enough burners for everyone, pots, etc, but it was crowded.  Too many cooks in the kitchen for me.  I was also a little saddened that we did not get to take home any of the left-over tamales even though there were plenty remaining for everyone.  Hopefully, someone ate them, and they weren't disposed.  That would be a real tragedy.   Overall, a fun class.  And I learned something.  Ever had an olive in your tamale?   Olives are put in tamales for luck.  Have you also noticed it seems few people do this anymore?  I now know who to blame for my inherent bad luck.

************************WEAR BIG PANTS************************  I had never had chicken and waffles together.  In fact, I don't think I've even had fried chicken outside of KFC and Hungry Man (I guess women don't get hungry?).  For a meal that did not involve a tortilla, I was pleasantly surprised.  I went with the Betty Boop, a breast and a waffle.  The chicken was juicy and perfectly fried to a crisp golden brown.  The waffle was delicious, although maybe I wish it were just a little crispier on the outside.  But the cinnamony goodness was complimented by a nice baseball-sized scoop of butter and plenty of syrup.  Of course, I had to have the mac & cheese, too.  It was some of the best I've had in a restaurant (I'm a little partial to Kraft I'm afraid to admit).    We had a large group, and the staff was very accommodating and friendly.    But word of warning, they don't split checks for large groups and will only process two transactions per table (two credit cards or cash and one credit card).  Luckily I planned ahead and brought cash...and wore big pants.

And the trend continues.  They are not interested in new business either.  I requested a call back even if they couldn't help me, so I could move on, but no response.

As a kid growing up in the desert, it represented a few things...an obstacle between me and the carnival to traverse at night with no flashlight and a pant leg full of cholla needles, the place where my dog kept disappearing to, and my single mother's idea of a great family outing consisting of metal detecting and rattlesnake hunting.    The desert was the place I would leave and to which I would never return.  In a cruel twist of fate, I'm back.  But as an adult, I've come to appreciate a lot about the deserts.  The best sunsets and lightning shows, plant and wildlife that defies all odds, and relative solitude.  My husband and I finally decided a proper desert outing was in order and headed to McDowell Mountain Park for a "hike."  Check out Norm R's excellent review with all the details about this park.  We opted for the North Trail, an easy 3-mile loop that will not test your endurance and is suitable for all fitness levels.  Much to my husband's dismay, there are benches along the loop.  If I see a bench, my ass will sit on it, whether I need to or not, under the pretense of taking in the scenery.  And there is much to take in here.  As we were out fairly early for this time of year, we only saw two other people and their delightful Rhodesian Ridgebacks on the trail as they jaunted past us.  Otherwise, it was just us, the desert, the birds, the rabbits, and the deer.  Yes, I saw a deer again!  Granted it was not grazing outside my office or jumping over my car, but there it was, a deer, in the middle of the desert.  I was happy to not see a snake or a scorpion which is why January is the perfect time to visit the park.  On the way out, we stopped at the visitor center and purchased an annual pass for $75 which allows access to all Maricopa County Parks except Lake Pleasant.  I was hesitant with the summers lasting so long, but with the picnic areas and night programs, I'm thinking we can get our money out of this.  I'm just hoping this park stays open!

5 stars - "Woohoo! As good as it gets!"  Somehow this just doesn't seem fitting given the circumstances.    To some people pets are property, to others friends and family members.  To me...well I probably had what some might consider an "unhealthy" relationship with my cat, Jasper, whom my husband later so crudely dubbed "The Big Sexy."  But Jasper had been with me for more than 16 years, my husband only 8.  Who would you expect to have the highest rank in the house?  It was somewhat of a last minute decision to handle Jasper's final arrangements ourselves, rather than using the service provided by our veterinarian.  And I'm glad that we did.  I was impressed with the services Fairwinds offers. Their focus is as much on those "surviving" the loss, as well as the pet.    Mary and Fairwinds are available to retrieve your pet valley-wide 24/7.  You may also bring your pet to them (no charge during regular business hours).  Fairwinds' services range from just the cremation to a clergy-presided service, and everything in between.   Mary will gladly accommodate special requests as well (paw impressions for example).   We opted to take the Sexy in ourselves, and were warmly greeted by Mary and two new friends of the canine variety.  They were blissfully unaware that funeral homes are to be quiet, yet they were oddly comforting, especially to my husband who has always been a dog person.  All cremations are not only individual, but private as well (meaning only one animal at a time is cremated).  There are procedures in place upon your pet's arrival to ensure there are no mix-ups either.  I was 100% confident I would not be crying over a little bit of my Mr Man and a little bit of someone's schnauzer.  The website lists the pricing, but you can also choose just the services important to you, and not a "package."   Mary handled the details professionally and personally.  It is clear she has a deep understanding of the bond some of us have with our pets, and she does everything she can to respect that bond.  Jasper's ashes were ready within 2 days.  We were given our keepsakes, a big hug, and resources should I need some serious therapy.    So yes, Mary is "as good as it gets."  I hope my fellow Yelpers don't need to use her services, but she will be there if you do.

Roasted chicken salad with gorgonzola, grapes, candied walnuts, and celery served over mixed greens and drizzled with a lovely balsamic vinaigrette.    I ate it all, along with a healthy serving of bread and warm olives.  And by the way, those warm olives are not a serving of just a few.  It's a pot of them bathed in olive oil.  Probably the best deal on the menu at a mere 450 pennies, if you like olives.  Yes, I'm a fan of Marcella's and hope to make it back to her kitchen soon.

3.5 stars.  Located inside the Arizona Biltmore, this is the more casual of their two main restaurants.    My husband and I had dinner here, and were both pleased.  The green chili chicken empanadas were a bit dry, but tasty nonetheless.  The New York strip was perfectly cooked and topped with a mound of garlic butter and served with sea salt fries which were fantastic.  Bumping to 4 stars for outstanding service.  Definitely worth a trip back in better weather to enjoy their patio!

We were fortunate enough to buy a home with granite slab in the kitchen and both baths.  Unfortunately, the granite was put over 40-year old cabinetry.  I agreed to save the granite in the guest bath and reface the vanity.  When Kirk came for the estimate, I learned Canyon Kitchen not only does refacing, but custom cabinetry as well.  In fact, they do complete kitchen and bath remodels, including windows.  First off, while refacing may be a less expensive option in a kitchen, it's not necessarily that much cheaper in a bathroom.  A 6-ft vanity with two new drawer boxes was approximately $1300 with solid wood doors and drawer fronts.  However, we were able to save the countertop and not have to worry about plumbing or tile work.  We also had electrical moved, the texture on one wall sanded down and retextured, and some drywall patching.  The electrical was done first by a sub contractor, and there were no issues.  During the refacing, one of the owners called to check on the progress of the job.  I was asked to call in and authorize payment when the job was complete.  I did sign off on the job, but noted there were a couple of nicks in the doors.  I didn't find this to be a problem that a stain stick couldn't correct, and I didn't want to wait any longer.  However, the owner immediately came over to inspect the doors, and advised me they must have been damaged in transit as he would not have sent them out of the shop that way.  He insisted on taking them with him and having them repaired, reminding me the job was not cheap and needs to be done right.  Wow. Somebody actually takes pride in their work.  I thought that concept was lost.  The doors were back in a few days!  And I was surprised at how nice the vanity looked.  The only disappointment was the texturing could have been better.  It needed to be relatively flat to match the rest of the room which has who knows how many layers of paint on it.  We noticed right away some areas were on the sloppy side (edges, around the toilet, etc).  There was also some pitting in the texture, air from the sprayer being too close??  But since it's really easy to do a little sanding before it's painted, I let it go.  Unfortunately my husband jumped the gun and primed the walls in spite of my telling him not to.  And once painted, you can tell the texture is quite a bit heavier than the rest of the room, and the imperfections remain.  I hate that, but not enough to have it redone.  I would recommend Canyon Kitchen, but not for drywall stuff unless you're completing gutting a room.  I would also suggest that if you have an older place with a lot of paint on the walls, you request demolition be done (removal of old cabinet moulding) on a different day than the new install if you'll be repairing the resulting damage to the walls yourself.  It's really hard to make these repairs once the new trim is in, especially if you don't know what you're doing.

Five star customer service!  Received a message from Canyon advising they read the review and would like to come back and redo the texturing.  I'm declining as nothing could convince me to repaint that bathroom.  Do you know how hard it is to get clean lines when using dark colors?  I taped, painted, taped again, repainted, taped a 3rd time, repainted, before finally getting it right.  But I am super impressed Canyon's number one goal is to ensure customers are happy!

I'm not really an Asian food enthusiast, but I have to say I loved Tottie's!  Since the menu is pretty extensive, we asked for a recommendation and had the green curry.  My dining companion likes things a little spicier than I do, so we ordered a medium-low.  It wasn't too much heat for me, but I can only imagine what ordering hot will do to you!  The curry was fantastic.  The heat cannot mask the flavor of this dish!    I'm already looking forward to going back to Tottie's the next time my husband puts his foot down about eating at yet another Mexican restaurant!

I'm clearly late to the party here....by about 350 reviews and 6 years, but better late than never.  I don't know what else to say that hasn't been said.  Everything was fantastic!  My words of wisdom...go, share, enjoy it all.  And make a reservation.  This is why it took me so long.  One failed attempt to walk in.  I don't like failure.

Another place that was bumped up on the list thanks to Yelp in Bloom.  And this is probably one of my new favorite places.  $5 glasses of wine until 6 pm everyday, including weekends.  And not just "select" wines, almost all of them.  In fact, I had a nice glass of Sauvignon Blanc for $3 as an open bottle special. Yes, you read correctly.  $3!!! In Scottsdale!  We sat on the patio which is behind the restaurant and nicely hidden from the street.  We started with bruschetta, and chose four to try.  I think my favorite was the apple, brie, and fig jam.  Perhaps my least favorite was the tomato, mozzarella, and basil, but only because it was too heavy for the bread and was difficult to eat.  They were all great.    We also shared a  prosciutto and brie panini which was really good.  They're not giant but enough to share if you're having appetizers.  And we were each given a salad with our panini portion.  Our server was excellent, but we were given a dirty plate.  It was dirty on the underside so she probably would not have seen it.  Our wines were also mixed up.  When my lips puckered at the first drink, I knew I had the Riesling.  Luckily, I caught it before my husband drank my entire glass in one gulp.  Overall, a fantastic find and I can't wait to go back.  Hell, why am I writing this review now.  It's before 6!

Southwest Veterinary Oncology is a division of Southwest Veterinary Referral Center, which offers a variety of veterinary specialists in one location.  The oncologist is actually in North Scottsdale twice weekly, which was an added bonus.  We met with Dr. Hillers to discuss Big Sexy's treatment options for basal cell carcinoma around his ear.  Our regular vet indicated it would probably be surgery, but suggested we get a specialist involved.  Based only on our initial consultation, I can give Dr. Hillers nothing less than 5 stars.  She was pleasant, good with Mr. Fabulous (Big Sexy, not my husband), and clearly an expert in her field.  Without question, she was interested in doing what's best for the cat, and not the clinic's finances.  Based on the cat's age, intolerance for stress (yes, he pooped once in my car, twice in their office), and other health conditions, she advised neither radiation therapy (5 days per week!) nor radical surgery were the best options, especially given the cost vs the likelihood that the tumors would return anyway.  Instead, she suggested use of a topical cream marketed for the two-legged population, which can be applied at home and will hopefully result in making Big Sexy more comfortable.  We were given the option of a chest x-ray for a metastatic check, but were not encouraged to get it unless we felt it would change our preferred course of treatment.  My husband insisted we get it for my peace of mind, and we were promptly e-mailed the radiologist's report so that we could ignore his recommendation anyway:)  The consultation was very reasonably priced, and the bloodwork and x-rays were comparable to what my regular vet charges.  I really do highly recommend Dr. Hillers if you're in a similar situation.

My husband and I attempted to have lunch here, but it was a debacle.  We ordered a pizza and paid for it.  But as we were getting our drinks, the gal that took our order came out and told us they were out of mozzarella, and that the manager could go to the store to buy some, but he would be gone 20 minutes.  After looking at the menu, we opted to leave since the sandwiches we were interested in also had mozzarella.  However, when we told her we were going to leave, she said the manager had already left, and we could not get a refund until he returned because she "could not get into the drawer."  What?  First of all, we payed with a card.  I don't know why she couldn't run a credit on the machine.  So now, we cannot eat and we cannot get our money back.  I had fully intended to wait and speak with the manager when he came back from his cheese run as this seemed pretty ridiculous.  If none of the employees are properly trained or authorized to manage the restaurant, he should have sent one of them to the store.  Finally, another employee came out and magically opened the drawer and gave us a cash refund.  Maybe they have great pizza, but clearly, the place is not managed well, and I won't say never, but I doubt I will return.

Not the fault of this location, I preface my review by stating we have the world's worst mail carrier.  I'm pretty certain I deliver more mail than he does.  We've found mail on the ground more than once, and if we're lucky it's our own.  We have a box with a top you rotate which apparently requires shoving everything in at once to ensure the mail is bent, torn, or destroyed.  Anytime he takes a rubber band off of a bundle, it's generously tossed in our driveway to save us a trip to Staples I'm sure.  And if that's not bad enough, he's probably the rudest guy you'll ever meet.  So anytime I go into a post office, I'm reminded how much I despise this guy.    Enter post office on McDowell.  There are a few good people there, but in general I think they require a prior history in used car sales.  Before I can get a word out of my mouth...Would you like overnight service?  No thanks, just priority mail.  What about insurance and delivery confirmation?  No thanks, just priority mail.  What about stamps, labels, shipping supplies or a prescription for Xanax?  No, just mail the damn package please.  Would you like cash back?  NO!!!!   But now I need a Xanax.

So whenever former Phoenix Yelper Jim W arrives or departs, you can count on a dust storm, a big one.  It's like he's got his own set of haboobs.  But when he suggested La Condesa, I said to hell with a clean car and clean hair.  It was about time I met La Condesa.  And the pleasure was all mine.  First off, the salsa bar is more like a salsa buffet.  And the guacamole..yum, it had mango in it!  Not sure if that's a seasonal thing, but it was tasty.  The carne asada taco was good, but the Mayan Cochinita Pibil taco (let's just call it shredded pork) was so far beyond good, you have to taste it to believe it.  And I suggest you do, soon.

I'm always hesitant to go anywhere on Mill Ave when ASU is in session, especially a pub of any kind, on a Saturday evening.  But, I've apparently been out of school so long that I had forgotten the students do not make their appearance until long after I would already be home.  So I was surprised to find Robbie Fox's fairly empty.  Although there were some parties on the patio, the restaurant was almost empty.  I was also surprised to find white tablecloths, a menu that includes such entrees as curry chicken and cioppino in addition to Irish fare, and Rat Pack music in the background.  I have no complaints, just surprised.  Since this was the first week of my (politically correct) temporary change in eating habits, I actually considered grilled salmon or a salad.  However, I didn't want to have to make the effort to glare at my husband all night watching him eat his fish & chips.  Lucky for me, they have a smaller portion available for $8.  Well, actually, it was unlucky for me because the portion was quite small with one filet, and it was really good.  The batter was nicely seasoned and perfectly crispy as were the thin-cut fries served with it.  I did notice while the outside of the fish was "just out of the fryer hot," the fish itself was only warm.  For dessert we shared the baked rhubarb, what I deemed the healthiest option rather than the option of no dessert which was not an option.  Basically a rhubarb cobbler, minus the crust, add a crumble topping.    Service was good, but our server was very young and relatively inexperienced.  He had a little trouble adequately describing a few of the menu items, but at least he was attentive and made the effort!   I would definitely go back to Robbie Fox's, and I did notice the Irish music kicked on as we were leaving!

I had my birthday dinner here a few months ago.  Oddly, the weather in March was warmer than it is now.  I digress.  Anyhow, beautiful patio!  Although I would have preferred to sit on the patio furthest from Lincoln, it was closed for a wedding.  Not sure if it's normally open for general seating, but I'm hoping so.  Because we can't help ourselves, we started with both the shrimp pepper pot and the cheese and charcuterie plate.  The shrimp was in a rich, spicy broth, and served with crusty bread.  Delicious and perfectly cooked.  The small-sized cheese and charcuterie was to serve 1-2.  We either got the large size in error or there are some big ass eaters out there.  And I'm one of them, so I can't imagine that this was the small.  But regardless, there was a nice variety of cheeses and meats with all the accoutrements one could need.  Then came the sticky buns.  Dang.  I forgot about those when we ordered two apps.  Ooey, gooey sticky goodness.  But eat them while they're hot.  Once they cool off, it's over.  I do wish these were served at the end of the meal though.  I felt like it was a dessert.  Not enough so that I wouldn't order dessert...that would be unthinkable.  By now, we could have skipped dinner, but I insisted and we opted to split an entree, the seafood pasta.  This is where the star comes off.  We opted to pay the up-charge to have them portion it for us.  You actually get more seafood that way.  But I would have preferred less in the end.  While the pasta and sauce were very good, every piece of seafood in the dish was overcooked...shrimp, scallops, lobster, etc.  For the price point, there's no excuse for that.  I almost took 2 stars off, but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt that this was the exception.  But it was disappointing enough that while I will gladly return for drinks and appetizers, I'm in no hurry to actually have dinner.

I admit it, I fell for the hook.  The big old yellow lab who greets all passersby every Saturday at the Old Town Farmers Market, and will cram his equally big head in your bag to see what might be appealing.  He was particularly fond of another customer's collard greens yesterday.  So there's the 5th star.  As for the fish, it's pretty fantastic, too.  We've been purchasing both the king salmon ($22/lb) and the silver salmon ($15/lb) regularly for the last few months and have never been disappointed.  It is so good, in fact, that it was still edible even after it caught fire last week on the grill, though not my recommended serving suggestion.  The only problem is once you eat this fish, you will forever be tied to a higher price tag than what's available in most grocery stores.  Is it worth it?  Absolutely!

It's Saturday morning at 11:27 am, and I should be at Richardson's savoring a Richardsons combo with a jalapeño benedict (with pork loin and jalapeño hollandaise) and two chicken enchiladas with both red and green sauce (why settle when you can have both).  I would also even have some of the asparagus they throw on the plate so you can feel that you had a healthy meal.  I should be washing it all down with a bloody mary requested to be "just a little spicy", so that it has just enough of a spicy kick for me.  Or maybe I should branch out and have the carne adovada and eggs or huevos rancheros or anything on that wonderful brunch menu.  And maybe I should go a second time to award the coveted 5th star, just to make sure it's excellence was not a fluke.  But instead, I'm writing about it.  Should have, could have, would have, but didn't.  Well this is just depressing, so I'm headed to the tamale festival instead.  But I'm thinking Richardson's tomorrow.

Lunch - 4 stars ($12.95) Weekend Dinner - 5 stars ($24.95) Sunday Brunch - 5 stars ($26)  Three visits, one week.  Hopefully, this is enough to pacify my husband, and we can take a break from the all-you-can-eat concept.    Big open dining room that includes a bar with seating is nice.  I always liked the wall of windows that opens up to additional outdoor seating.  It should be really nice when the view includes more than dirt, and it's not stinkin' hot outside.  We found drink service to be excellent at all three visits, and plates were promptly cleared.  Servers were also very accommodating in providing new utensils upon request.    First visit was lunch.  As far as buffets go, this one has plenty to choose from.  We found Asian, Mexican, Italian, steak, chicken, fish, and pork at the carving station that day, in addition to plenty of salads, cheese, cold cuts, and desserts, including a gelato bar.  There were a few minor issues that need to be resolved.  The steak was not a tender cut of meat, and a few of the dishes were not as hot as they should have been.  Also, some of the items were not labeled.  Yes, I don't need a label on fried chicken, but one on the soup might have been nice.  While I found this to be an above-average lunch buffet, I think for the price I would prefer to just order off a menu.  Sunday brunch was the second visit, and worth every penny as the price includes unlimited mimosas, bloody mary's, bellinis, etc.  Although I can't personally vouch that it really is unlimited, I do know I had two and my husband had something more than two, and there was not the ridiculous wait that often comes with "unlimited" drinks.  Buffet had upgraded options from lunch, including oysters, shrimp, prime rib, smoked salmon, and eggs benedict.  Also more selection of cheeses, breads, and fruit.  So much to try that I had to restrict my intake of inexpensive fillers, and focus on the value-added items.  Third stop was weekend dinner.  Similar to brunch, minus the breakfast items and champagne.  New York steak was at the carving station and mussels were on the menu that day.  No crab legs, but smoked salmon, oysters, shrimp, and some other fish entrees made an appearance both at the buffet and on my plate.    At all services, the buffet was very clean and plates are available in numerous locations.  My only suggestion would be to include an extra fork with the utensils.  Since there are none at the buffet, you need to ask if you accidentally leave it on an empty plate or you don't want to finish off your key lime pie with mashed potato residue.  Those potatoes by the way, had a ton of butter in them!

Just a note that I overheard the manager at WHB tell a customer that when he was training staff, he used Yelp to find out what things employees should not do!  Yay for managers who find value in our reviews!

I can't speak to the coffee because I don't drink it.  But I can say the staff caught me peering in as they were closing, and welcomed me in anyway (and I mean welcomed me, not begrudgingly asked if I wanted anything warning me they're about to close) where I treated myself (because I always control the money) to an over-sized lemon bar.  While the lemon bar was not the best I've had, it was pretty good and it was over-sized and that's an extra star alone.  Oh, and they have Pellegrino Limonata, my favorite!

$9.95 for the dinner buffet that includes tandoori chicken and perfect garlicky naan brought straight to your table.  I'm pretty sure I had about $7 in naan myself.  How can you beat that?  Well it takes more than price for me to be happy.  It takes good food, and India Oven has that as well.  I'm not usually a fan of buffets...food is often not so great and sometimes the choices are limited.  But in this case, neither of those applied.  I checked out the buffet before sitting down, and found quite a bit to choose from.  I tried most of the dishes.  In a few cases, I didn't even know what I was eating, but I knew I liked it!  I did find it a little odd that we walked in at opening, yet a few things were barely warm though.  Also, if you like things hot, you may want to order off the menu as the buffet is quite mild.  The sizzling tandoori chicken bumped this buffet up to 4 stars.  Definitely worth the drive, and I don't say that about many things.  I hate driving.

Wonderful restaurant!  My husband and I dined here for our anniversary.  Upon arrival, you'll be whisked to the top of the resort in a private elevator which opens to a lovely lounge.  The piano player is definitely a nice touch.  There your hostess will greet you.  Yes, greet you.  No employees huddled in private conversation.  My husband requested a private booth for sunset.  Once I relocated half a dozen pillows in the booth, I settled in to the table overlooking a wall of drawn shades.  There were a couple side chairs in the corner as well.  I'm assuming this is so your dining partner has somewhere to sit in the event you overdo it and need to lie down in the booth between courses.  At the magic hour, the blinds were raised and there was a wall of floor-to-ceiling windows with lovely mountain views and a setting sun.  Very romantic, but let's get to the food.  We started with a small iced shellfish platter with king crab legs, oysters, mussels and shrimp.  The crab legs were already cracked which I appreciate greatly.  For my entree, the mediterranean sea bass with leeks and mushrooms in a white wine sauce.  Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, perfectly eaten.  For sides we shared the fried green tomatoes and the cauliflower gratin.  The gratin was sinfully rich and creamy.  The tomatoes were nicely fried, but not quite tender enough.  We were given a complimentary dessert as well.  Service was impeccable from start to finish.  I felt the pricing was more than reasonable for a restaurant such as this.  Our meal was somewhere around $250, excluding tip, but that also included flowers for me (which were beautifully done!) and a bottle of wine.  They do have a dress code that while enforced, it's not terribly strict..mostly no t-shirts, ripped up jeans, flip-flops, etc.  Nothing that would kill any of us to abide, even in the middle of July.  Note to husband...would love to go again!!

I went to Chompies for the first time recently at a great UYE.  What better way to try somewhere new?  Even if the food is a big fat fail, you know you'll have great company!  Luckily, it wasn't a big fat fail.  It was a big fat success.  Tried the Jewish sliders with brisket, gravy, and a potato pancake.  It was like a home-cooked Sunday dinner mom used to make all wrapped up in a challah roll.  Except mom rarely made "Sunday dinner" , and if she did, it would have been wrapped in a tortilla or a Sonic brown paper bag, since we never heard of challah.  But aside from those minor differences, it was just like Sunday dinner.  Great service for our rather large group, too.  They even brought out some little cookies for us to try, which led us to the bakery on our way out!  Thanks to Jim and Audrey for organizing, and thanks to Chompie's for a great meal!

Here's what I learned from my journey to Sal's:  1.  When your husband commits to meeting his cousin for dinner who is in town for business, get an address of where he is staying before looking for restaurants, because when your husband says Glendale, he really means Avondale.  2.  Expect that many of the area restaurants close at 8 pm.  Sal's was the welcome exception.  3.  Do not, I repeat, do not follow GPS from Scottsdale, unless you like a half dozen unnecessary freeway changes.  Why the hell did I need to get on I-17 or State Rt 143?  4.  Skip all the research and just go to Sal's.  Who doesn't like a good wood-fired pizza?  5.  Order Sal's Special Pizza...pepperoni, sausage, peppers, onions, and mushrooms.  Something for everyone.  6.  Do not stuff as much pizza in as humanly possible, as they will box up the leftovers.  Skip my advice, and it's a long ride back to Scottsdale.  If I lived in the area, Sal's would be a go-to spot for me!

These little piggies come from a small farm in Nebraska still run by the family of one of the co-founders of Pork on a Fork.  Of course, the prices are higher than that you would pay in the mega grocery stores today.  But for me, not only do I get better quality, I get peace of mind in knowing that the little piggies were raised humanely with fresh air and exercise, and they were not pumped full of growth hormones.  I ordered the premium package for $50 and received 4 boneless chops (about 6 oz each), a package of 2 ham steaks, a pound of bacon, and a pound of pulled pork (smoked over pecan wood).  Everything is frozen, so you can just pop it in your freezer until ready to use, and everything is delicious.  The pulled pork is the winner for me since all I have to do is heat it!  You can order and pay on-line and specify which farmers' market you would like to pick up from (their calendar is on the website).  Couldn't be easier.  Although my first order was put in the wrong freezer and sent to another market, they quickly made up my package on-site and took my word for it that I had already paid.  They also have a restaurant opening this month, I believe, at 15th Ave & Deer Valley Rd!

Still love their product, but their online ordering process just doesn't work.  First time, my order was sent to the wrong market.  Second time, I was shorted a package of chops.  I checked the bag before I left the market, so it was only a minor inconvenience.  Third time I ordered bacon, which was listed as available on the web site, and then contacted and advised it was not and may not be available for a few weeks.  Since I paid upon ordering, I had to go through the hassle of waiting for a refund.  I've also noticed inconsistency in portion size which is a problem considering you pay by product, rather than pound.  Boneless chops should be roughly 6-oz each, yet I've received 4-oz chops at times, resulting in 50% less product for the same price.  Not a deal breaker for me, but something to consider.  I continue to purchase from these guys regularly, but no longer try to order ahead.  And I do wish they would have bacon available more often!

Our last drain clean lasted about 3 months before we had a slow drain again.  At the recommendation of another company, we called Option One this time.  Clearly they are not out only to make a buck as I got the impression the plumber didn't really want to snake it since it was draining.  Draining is not enough for me.  There is nothing more disgusting than standing in bath water, even if it's my own.  And what if my husband showers first?  Then I have to wait until it's fully drained, rinsed out, and disinfected because we all know men are always more disgusting.  So, the man snaked it anyway and removed a small clog, but that was all it took.  I paid my $50 and 4 months later, still draining perfectly!

I don't know what exactly I can add given the number of reviews here, but here's my take on the food:  Iceberg wedge-I loved that it came with green goddess dressing, but there was maybe a thimbleful of it, and by the time the server came back around, I was nearly finished.  Bacon cheddar biscuits-Bacon and cheddar in a warm biscuit, golden brown on the outside, soft on the inside.  Yes, it was terrible.  One could only imagine the horror I endured.  Fork tender short ribs-More like spoon tender, great flavor with the red wine reduction  and NO fat!  Chocolate-dipped bacon s'mores-Okay I'm in the minority here, but not my favorite.  First, I'm not into the whole deconstructed food idea, but I can kind of see the idea here.  However, I wanted my graham crackers left in bigger squares, so there's more room for assembly.  You can't go wrong with toasty marshmallow, and the whipped peanut butter was an unexpected delight, but I'm not sold on chocolate-covered bacon.  I like bacon in sweets (I even made bacon bourbon brownies once), but I didn't think the chocolate dipped bacon was anything special.  There I said it.  Take a number to stone me.  But please wait until I've gone back to try that fig and pecan pie.  I'm betting that's a winner!

I was almost ready to give Spotted Donkey the coveted 5 stars, but it occurred to me that I was most likely wanting to give that 5th star because I had not eaten anything resembling Mexican food in over a month!  So reason won and I'm going with a very strong 4.  Not your typical menu of tacos and enchiladas smothered with a cup of melted cheese and swimming in grease.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  Nothing beats good Sonoran fare in my book.  At Spotted Donkey you will find chimis and enchiladas on the menu, but also cornmeal crusted mahi mahi and pan roasted pork tenderloin.    We started with the chips and salsa.  I have to say I was not all that impressed with the chips.  They reminded me more of a bigger version of Fritos than a thin and crispy chip I prefer.  Served with a trio of salsas, my favorite was the charred tomato followed closely by the green tomatillo.  The pineapple habanero may have been tasty, but one bite and my tongue was so swollen I lost all sense of taste for the next 15 minutes.  My husband managed to eat a fair amount of it, however.  I attribute that to his southern roots and exposure to moonshine at the age of 6.  His entree was the chipotle honey-glazed grilled salmon tostada.  With a black bean mango salsa and avocado vinaigrette, it was quite good.  The only thing negative...it was seriously undercooked in the middle.  Had it been mine, I would have sent it back.  I know there seems to be a trend of rare fish being served, but if this was intentional, the server should ask how you would like it prepared.  I smartly chose the mesquite roasted port antojito...like mini tostadas but served on a thicker corn "cake" that is fried.  The pork was perfectly lean, perfectly seasoned, and quickly devoured.  For dessert we shared the ancho chile brownie sundae which was served with both hot caramel and hot fudge sauces on the side.  Expecting to prefer the chocolate sauce, I actually did not.  Although it had good flavor, the consistency was off and there was a little separation.  I am not usually a fan of caramel, but this sauce was ridiculously good, with a strong hint of salt coming through.  Had it been served with nothing but a spoon, the dessert still would have worked for me.  The ancho chile brownie was fantastic, although I maybe would have preferred just a touch more of chile in the background.  I would be hard pressed to go back and have any dessert other than this one.  I loved the atmosphere at Spotted Donkey, loved the food, and had fantastic service.  The underdone fish was the only reason it didn't make the 5th star this time around, but I would definitely return.

Where to begin to tell this tale of woe.  We arrive at approximately 10:18 am for a 10:20 showing.  Clue #1 this is not going to be a happy ending--although it's the first showing of the day, we are charged for a full price ticket.  I question why the price is so high, and basically get "I don't know," but it is corrected.  By 10:35 previews have not begun.  We are the only ones in the theater so we ask if we are in the wrong theater.  They double check our tickets, send us back in, and call for assistance.  Another employee comes in, also checks our tickets, and calls for the movie to begin.  All is well until..  With roughly 15 minutes left of the movie, guests begin to file in for the next movie creating chaos.  An employee then has a conversation over the RADIO about what is happening.  At this point, our movie is abruptly cut, and we are directed to the manager to whom I am already planning to pay a friendly visit.  The manager does apologize but tries to justify a problem in their schedule (the 10:20 movie was supposed to be a 10:20 pm showing) and convince me they had done us a favor by playing it anyway.  They also offer free passes and offer to have us join the 11:30 showing for the ending, which was about an hour behind!  While I am trying to explain the favor would have been to not run nearly two hours of a movie only to cut it, but to be up front about the problem BEFOREHAND, I hear laughter in the background.  Yep, it's my husband who has suddenly found this whole thing humorous.  Now while I'm trying to listen to the manager's excuse that they were "hoping" it would be over in time (don't movies have published running times?) my husband's laughter in the background is becoming increasingly deafening.  That's all I can focus on.  It's ringing in my hears, and my head is about to explode.  I am thrown off my game, and I accept 4 free passes I don't want just to get out of there and redirect my attention to Mr. I Just Made a Big Mistake, which I did all the way home.  That's when I remember the refund.  To salvage the rest of the day, I offer to let my husband return to the theater for the refund and record the conversation to prove me to me he did so without any kind of "wow, sorry dude that my wife is mean" kind of banter.  Only taking off one star because the manager was apologetic. However, I did not appreciate the attempted spin that they were trying to accommodate us.  Wasting nearly two hours of my time to see "almost" an entire movie is not accommodating.  And train your employees!  Start with the one up front who doesn't notice that $19.50 doesn't seem quite right for two early morning tickets.  And in case you're wondering, the movie was "Crazy, Stupid, Love."  It begins with a wife asking her husband for a divorce.  I don't know how it ends.

So while my in-laws were in line to order plain hot dogs because they weren't willing to even try the combinations this particular food truck was offering, much less see which other trucks were at the festival, I wandered off and settled on Jamburritos.    I returned to the band of boring and enjoyed my catfish plate.  My perfectly seasoned catfish was served with a spicy jambalaya rice and crispy hush puppies.  I ate every last bite far beyond the point of being full just so everyone could see what they missed.  "Is that catfish?"  "Yep (with full mouth)."  "Is it good?"  "(Swallow) Yes."  "Where did you get it?"  "(Takes another bite) At a truck that was not at the entrance so you didn't see it."  Thanks Jamburritos.

Having gone to the now-closed location on Shea, I didn't expect to find myself at the new The Herb Box anytime soon.  My one visit was fine, but didn't leave me wanting more.  However, when Deb L hosted a recent UYE, it was the perfect opportunity for great company at the very least.  Well I'm happy to report I received even more than great company....great food, great service, and comfortable, yet beautiful surroundings were also on the plate.    I began the evening with a glass of their house-made sangria.  I could drink this light and fruity beverage all day.  In fact, I think it would make a fine substitute for my morning OJ.  I did have a hard time choosing an entree.  While I was tempted by the pear and gorgonzola flatbread, I chose the goat-cheese chicken instead.  The shoulder cut chicken was perfectly cooked, but the meat itself was perhaps a little bland, although admittedly I do prefer chicken to be well-seasoned.  The goat cheese stuffing and the fig jam, however, resulted in an overall quite tasty dish.  I loved the mushroom risotto cakes served alongside!!  The Herb Box also graciously offered our table a variety of sweet treats at the end of the meal...a slice of fig bundt cake (my favorite), a couple different cupcakes, a whoopie pie, and a passionfruit cake.  While all were enjoyed, none of these wowed me.  I do think these may have been pastries available at the market, and not their dessert menu items.     So thanks to Deb for giving me a reason to try The Herb Box.  I'm sure I will be back again!  I didn't get a chance to browse the market!

Let me say first off, I have never been a fan of the "pot pie."  When I see a pot pie on a menu somewhere, I have visions of a Swanson's pot pie appearing on my plate and my having to pick out every last pea.  I always steer clear.  But then I was introduced to Saffron Kitchen.  I actually saw these pies baking on-site at Old Town Farmers Market.  At first, I had assumed they were a dessert pie and my first emotion was disappointment at learning otherwise.  But then I took a second look at the ingredients and was intrigued.  How can you not be intrigued with names like the "Snappy" (curried veggies with red potatoes, cauliflower, chick peas, baby peas and ginger), the "Spiffy" (grass-fed beef, bacon, and mushrooms), the "Swanky" (chicken breast, leeks, baby peas, carrots, and thyme), and the "Sassy" (eggplant, zucchini, garlic, and bell peppers with fresh thyme and parmesan)?  I had the "Sexy" (spinach, portobello, and shiitake mushrooms with ricotta, mozz, and feta).  So good words cannot describe it.  Available in two sizes, the small is the perfect size when you're farmers market sampling and the larger would be perfect for a heartier meal.  These gourmet pies are always baked the same day they are sold and available at the local markets with delivery or catering available as well.  These "Artisan pies" are truly deserving of an often overused word.  If I were one to host a dinner party, these would be on my menu!

I know, I know.  How many times am I going to sing the praises of Andrea's pies.  Two at least.  Maybe more if I don't see another review soon.  I can't get enough of these.  You'll now find me at the Old Town market every Saturday bright and early just to get my fix.  The breakfast pie (a crustless mini-quiche) with bacon, eggs, and onions is worth getting up early for as these sell quick.  This morning I tried the "Smarty" with salmon, mushrooms, and asparagus.  Who would have thought a fish pie, of all things, would be such pure deliciousness?  Although the herb sauce was a bit runny, since they're baked just before serving, the crust didn't get soggy at all.  And I have to admit, I drank the little bit of juice left in the bottom.  Luckily, I was sitting on a curb and not in a restaurant.    On a side note, Andrea is also a supporter of the farmers markets by using ingredients from fellow vendors.  Coincidentally, we buy from the same beef and seafood suppliers.  Only when I cook, it's not nearly as good...and I have to clean it all up.

I had passed on Big Earl's once previously after seeing the reviews were all over the place.  It goes back to my "what if this is my last meal, and it's a two star experience" phobia.  But after the Yelp event, we decided to make the giant leap of faith.  They had run out of pulled pork, so we waited until it was ready and started with the brisket.  Really flavorful although a little fatty in the center.  Maybe that's the norm...I usually don't eat brisket.  We were given a generous portion for waiting for the pork.  Nice!  Two sauces at the table, original and sweet and spicy.  The latter was too sweet for me, but it was spicy.  I preferred the original with it's vinegar base.  Still waiting for pork, we also had the cole slaw which I really liked since it was cider-based, rather than mayo.  The citrus collard greens were a nice alternative to the traditional ham hock flavor as well.  The corn bread that comes with the meal is a traditional corn muffin.  The dish you order as a side dish is two muffins topped with molasses.  While this was tasty, it was almost like a dessert and I preferred the corn bread without the molasses.  The only disappointment was the potato salad.  I thought the potatoes were a little too firm, and the dressing was too sweet and too much of it.  But I am extremely difficult to please when it comes to potato salad.  I'm almost always disappointed.    Finally, the big finale of the pulled pork.  Since it was just "pulled," we got an ample portion of the crispy outside portion with all the flavor.  Also all the meat is served dry so you really get the flavor of the bbq without the crutch of a sea of sauce.  As for dessert, we shared (meaning I ate most of it) the pecan and date pie.  Quite good, but served refrigerator cold, which is always a mistake IMHO.  Although the last time I had pie served warm, it was 2000 degrees on the inside, so maybe cold isn't so bad.  The chef, Tony, came out and chatted for a bit.  He only started within the last 2 weeks, and is still making some adjustments to the recipes and trying to work out some of the kinks that may have resulted in some of the early poor reviews.  Will definitely be back.

While I've never actually eaten a full meal at CPH, this is probably my favorite place for drinks and apps.  I don't even care that their happy hour discounts are not that great.  First off, they make a version of a sloe gin fizz.  Based on that alone, I'm at 5 stars.  The fact that it was fantastic was just an added bonus.  Second, they ingeniously thought to put bacon fat in the popcorn.  Now we're at 10 stars.    Third, 'kilt lifter" fondue.  Need I say more?

I am so pleased with Stan's service!  First off, he returned my call.  I am actually shocked at how many independently owned businesses in this area won't do that much.  He stopped by the same day to look at the job.  After installing a new front door, I needed the ceramic tiles replaced along the threshold since the footprint of the new one was different.  Although he was busy, he told me he would follow-up the next week.  AND HE DID!  I didn't even have to call him back.  He came with an assistant because he was so busy and they got the old tiles removed and the new ones in within a few hours.  He didn't want to grout until the tile was well-set so he left for a few hours and came back to finish the job.  Although he doesn't do a lot of tile, Stan did an excellent job in matching the grout lines.  Not an easy feat given the idiot who installed it the first time failed to do that.  Easy five-star review!  Thank you!

God forbid even something as simple as a bra size be standardized negating the necessity to be measured every time you go somewhere new.  But no.  It's always going to be a surprise.  Will you be a 32AA or a 36 D today?  And I cannot count the number of times (actually I can, it's 2) I have been told I measure a 32.  Maybe if your bra is made in the US, but anywhere else...that 32 really means 34 ,36, pick a freakin' number.  It's arbitrary.  Now that the rant is over, I can say I really did have a good experience at Soma.  The lady who helped me was fantastic, only I cannot remember her name because I am not so fantastic.  But once I proved to her I am not a 32, we were in business.  I received 100% of her attention.  So what if the store was empty.  Being the only customer in a restaurant doesn't always equal good service, does it?  She helped me find the right bra for a particular dress with minimal pain and suffering, at least on my end.  And to no surprise, I walked out with yet another size I have never purchased.  Also, a special thanks to my husband.  When trying on said dress, he offered this expert advice which led me to Soma in the first place..."I like the dress, but you need a different bra, a push-up would be good."  Thanks.

My favorite frozen yogurt place yet!  First, on walking in, I'm not greeted with a mass of people all trying to do different things (enter, exit, fill their cups, pay) in the same square foot.  I'm greeted by space...and lots of it.  And friendly employees that acknowledge you and ask if it's your first time.  Wow, it's been a long time since I heard that question.    I'm also greeted by sample cups.  Where they should be.  And a menu with the day's flavors so I don't have to peer over everyone's shoulders to see what's there and then back track because I prefer the first flavor I passed.  And I'm greeted by plenty of choices in yogurt...all worthy of a place in my cup.  And plenty of choices in toppings.  My only suggestions would be to not crush up the candy so much...I want to know there's a Snickers in my cup, not Snickers dust.  And get a different brownie bite (steal them from Yogurt Land if you have too)!  Other than that, I love Yogurtini!  And great outdoor space, too...even if it won't be usable for the next 6 months :(

Sometime long, long ago, I had a wonderful brunch at Windsor.  I remember it fondly.  A No 2 cocktail (vodka, peach puree, prosecco) times 2.  An amazing bloody mary bar, too bad I don't like bloody marys.  Warm donut holes with mascarpone and jam.  A fantastic breakfast burrito with Schreiner's sausage.  And more than one bite of my husband's strawberry pancakes.  Wouldn't have changed a thing, especially when the bill came and it was far less than I would have expected.  Big hug to Shannon M (and an unnamed former Yelper) for introducing us to this gem.

I love pancakes, but every time I go to breakfast, I forego them.  Somehow I talk myself into believing my 12-egg omelette with hash browns, bacon, and toast is "healthier."  This explains my ever-shrinking wardrobe options when I have to wear clothing not blessed by elastic.  So for my birthday breakfast, I decided I was having pancakes and would not get swayed by a breakfast burrito.  And what better place to go than a restaurant with "pancakes" in its name.  And strawberry pancakes I had, along with bacon and OJ.  The pancakes were light, fluffy, and golden brown and stuffed with strawberries and a compote on top made of fresh berries as well.  The bacon was thick, apple-wood smoked cooked to perfection, crispy, yet not burnt in the slightest.  And the juice fresh squeezed, of course.  YUM!    I was glad it was a nice morning, and we were able to sit outside.  The dining room wasn't anything special, and it was really loud.  Although the patio overlooks Hayden, it was much quieter there.  If only they were open for dinner!

Holy cow (may he rest in peace), they make a good burger!  Now I can eat a 6 pound burrito without taking a breath, but there's something about burgers where my appetite suffers.  I love a good burger, but about halfway through, I fall apart.  The meat just makes me sick.  I end up throwing it out and eating the bun.  Not at Smashburger.  I can order a small Smash and eat every last bite, and still want more!  And their fries are among the best out there.  I'm not sure what there isn't to like about it.  I guess I'll have to find an excuse to head to Marketplace this weekend and see if I can find something.

Sadly, all good things must come to an end.  Much like my relationship with Los Betos, so goes mine with Filiberto.  Maybe his cousin will be better.  On my last visit, the chips were burnt. The guac tasted old.  The cheese in the enchilada had re-solidified to some disastrous inedible wad of nastiness.  Yes, I threw out cheese.  And the beans were just...there aren't words to express the horror.  Dry, stiff, terrible flavor.  Thankfully the taco was good, as was the rice.  It's a damn good thing I buy a lot of food!  For now, I say goodbye.  But I know in my heart, someday I'll be back, remembering the good times, hoping he will have changed...Until then, I leave an extra star for the memories.

After the fabulous CMYE at Zoe's in Phoenix, I was delighted to see another restaurant open up in my neighborhood!  I can't really tell you how great the entire menu is because the only thing I ever order is spinach rolls with chicken and marinated slaw.  While I'm always tempted by other offerings, I also resort to my usual, and I'm never disappointed.  Well a little disappointed when my plate is empty, but not before.  I'm also a big fan of their limeade and never pass that up either.  But the best part of Zoe's is the staff.  Everyone is so incredibly hospitable.  I don't know where they find employees like that, but I'm glad they do!

My husband is going to need a second job to support my love affair with Tommy V's.  Love the new decor (clean and modern) and the staff.  Our visits were almost 2 weeks apart, and we were surprised that not only did the bartender (Lisa) remember us but remembered what we had to drink!  And the food...Fantastic happy hour that sadly runs only Mon-Fri and is really more of a lunch menu with salads, pasta dishes, and sandwiches.  The very happy hour menu offers select $5 apps, $5 well & wine, and beer specials.  First time we shared the short rib sliders from the $5 menu as well as risotto carbonara and smoked salmon bruschetta. While the bruschetta was perfectly fine, it was the only thing that didn't wow me.  The sliders (2) were worth twice their price tag and the risotto was incredible with pancetta, parmigiano, and peas.    Weekends offer only the dinner menu.  My husband had the grilled shrimp risotto (yes, he's into risotto thanks to all the Hell's Kitchen viewing this summer).  Although a little pricey ($18), it was well worth it.  Because good things come in threes, I had the hand-made pasta trio ($19):  mushroom and mascarpone tortelli; brie and asiago gnocchi in a brown butter sauce, and spinach ricotta ravioli.  The only bad thing about this dish was I had to offer my husband a bite of each.  My diet had been going so well, too.  What a shame it's all over.  See you soon Tommy.

I might have jumped the gun with my initial 5-star rating.  While I'm still a big fan, I've had a few disappointments.  Some of the dishes have been excellent, but a few just average.    The pan seared salmon was really nothing special and the flavors in the accompanying risotto were inconsistent, like one bite was great, the next bland.  My husband ordered the osso bucco, but there was so much sauce the risotto was more like a soup.  I might not have dinged a star if it weren't for a hostess that seats the only four parties in an otherwise empty restaurant right next to each other.  I don't get it.  But I do love their short rib grilled cheese and the risotto carbonara among other things.  Still one of my favorite places.

With a full parking lot at the Streets of New York next door, we opted for Pizza Re instead.  You order at the counter, and they bring the food to your table.  I wished there were actual plates and decent napkins, so for me, it's more of a lunch or quick meal situation.  I had planned to just get a slice.  But even though the menu lists all the toppings for slices, you're apparently limited to what they've made.  We went with a Hawaiian plus jalapeno.  It was a little slow coming, but other than the somewhat soggy middle, it was still a good pie with just the right thickness in the crust to be toasty on the outside, but still a little doughy inside.   I'm also a big fan of the half dozen wings.  I wish more places offered that.  Give me 6, I can eat 3 and be satisfied.  Give me 12, I eat 6 and then have eater's remorse.  So this is almost like a diet meal the way I see it.  And I had fruit on my pizza.

No cookie crumbs or candy dust here.  It looks like they pretty much cut them in half and call it good.  I had Snickers, Reese's, Butterfinger, and Nestle Crunch.  And about half a brownie.  I'm assuming the yogurt was fine, but it was hard to tell.  I'm pretty sure I had about 39 cents of yogurt in my $6 cup.  5 stars for toppings, cleanliness, and friendliness!

I had only been to Timo once before for drinks, but finally had the opportunity to go for a favorite Yelper's birthday brunch a few months ago.  We had two large tables, and the servers were able to keep up beautifully.  The mimosa flight was a great deal with glasses of orange, grapefruit, and cranberry.  The grapefruit was my favorite.  Damn it!  I'm not supposed to have grapefruit.  Oh well, it was worth it.  I also hesitatingly ordered the crab cake benedict.  The last time I tried this at another restaurant, the crab cake tasted more like a fish patty.  Not at Timo, it was perfect.  Well, the yoke was maybe a tad overcooked, but that's okay with me.  I would happily return for brunch again!

It seems to me that Scottsdale is severely lacking in the Mexican food arena as far as good food at reasonable prices.  Screw this table-side guacamole for $12 business.  Make it in the kitchen.  Not to say I don't order said guacamole.  But let it go on record, I disagree with it.  And I welcomed the addition of Filiberto's on Indian Bend if that tells you anything.  But I was really pleasantly surprised when I finally made it to Caldero.  They have some specialty dishes on the dinner menu that look quite good, but we were there for lunch, so I ordered from the "classics" menu.  And truthfully, if you can't make a taco, I'm not interested in moving forward in this relationship.  Chips and salsa are still free!  That's no longer a given sadly.  The red salsa was good with plenty of oregano and just the right kick for me.  The green was a queso dip, and would make a lovely beverage as far as I'm concerned.  For lunch, I had the chile rojo burro served enchilada style with rice and beans for $8!  Did I mention this is in Scottsdale?  Hopefully they don't talk to the table-side guac folks.  The burro was so stuffed with pork, I almost wished it had a little more sauce though.  I loved the enchilada sauce, too.  I went with charro beans...again delicious...over black or refried.  They also offer lemon cilantro rice in addition to the standard Spanish rice.  I had Spanish, and it was just fine...except for the obligatory peas everyone tosses in there.  Our server was excellent and very friendly, too!  I'm a little worried it was relatively empty on a Saturday afternoon.  But I'll be back and do my part in ensuring it stays open.

What a great spot!  I felt like I was driving to Canada, but that's only because LAMP is outside my usual 10 mile radius from Old Town.  Shannon M hooked us on to the zucchini cakes with basil aioli.  My husband didn't care for them, but he obviously has no sense because these were fantastic!  We chose the three crostini (white bean & roasted red pepper, ricotta, and pesto).  None stood out, and the flat bread was so chewy, it was hard to appreciate any of them.  We also ordered 2 pizzas because we have no concept of portion control.  My husband favored the Gem with both sausage and pepperoni and ricotta.  Too much meat for me.  I preferred the Gordon with capocollo, goat cheese, mushrooms, lots of garlic, and provolone.  Too much food to fit in a milkshake, but they have some very tempting options!

I really really really like OHSO.  I always feel a little odd reviewing a brewery since I don't drink beer, so I'll review the eatery part.  But let me say if I did like beer, I would love that you can buy small tastings before you commit.  Wouldn't it be great to be able to do that with anything?    First off, the menu is perfect with a handful of appetizers, small plates, salads, burgers, and sandwiches all for $10-$15.  The small plates are really not that small.  The shrimp tacos were really good as was the accompanying slaw.  The tortillas are street size, but you get a good half dozen or so.    I really loved the grilled chicken flatbread with plenty of cheese, bacon, garlic poblano sauce, and a cilantro pesto.  If you're not a fan of cilantro, it is almost undetectable.  I also wish the poblano sauce were a little spicier.  But what makes this flatbread is the chopped tomato and cucumber salad on top.  It adds a nice sweetness and freshness to the pie.  Without it, the dish would fall a little flat to me.  And whatever you get, add french fries.  Thin and crispy with a sprinkling of black pepper.  Mmm.  Mmm.  It's never been busy on my visits, but I've only gone for weekend lunches.  Hopefully they stick around for a while.

I could love Distrito.  But I have to be able to actually order food in order to get to that point.  My husband and I stopped in for an early brunch, around 11.  The restaurant was nearly empty, yet service was mysteriously slow.  It took forever to get drinks, but in the bartender's defense, she looked engaged in important conversation with another employee.  But I was a big fan of the Paloma margarita made with grapefruit soda.    I tried to order the chicken enchilada.  They were "out".  I then ordered the chilaquiles, but the server came back because they were "out."  How?  They hadn't even been open 30 minutes and no one was there.  Made me think there was a problem with the chicken.  Scary.  So I went with the breakfast burrito because they apparently had eggs and chorizo.  It was good, but not what I wanted.  Now I'm at 3 stars, but I have to bump to four because they have excellent guacamole and The Best shrimp ceviche.  It's so good they should rename it that.  The Best Ceviche.  I look forward to another visit, but will ask for the list of what they do have first.

Once upon a time, I used to really love Taj Mahal in this same location.  But it kind of went downhill over time.  Seemed like the prices kept going up while the amount of actual protein served decreased.  But now Southern Spice has moved in, and I've eaten here repeatedly for much more than convenience.  Great food and reasonable prices.  The chili paneer has become a staple appetizer for my husband and I.  On a good night, it's got just the slightest hint of a crunch to the edges.  On a bad night, still delicious.   I love both the butter chicken and chicken korma.  And the garlic naan...some of the best I've had.  The perfect balance of toastiness on the outside, chewiness on the inside.  The garlic has never been burnt either (I'm talking to you Tandoori Times).  Entrees thankfully include rice.  I have been getting pretty sick and tired of paying extra for that.  I'm only taking a star off because a couple times I got a piece of chicken that wasn't well-trimmed.  I hate having anything in my mouth that I wouldn't willingly swallow.  So not cool.  But otherwise, I'm a fan and will single-handedly do my best to keep them in business.  I'm generous like that.

Buried in my unfinished reviews is this one.  I owe Paradise Bakery an apology as I love this particular location.  Lots of seating and always clean.  I actually prefer Paradise for dinner, rather than lunch.  No parking dilemmas, and the place is nice and quiet.  Before this one opened, the nearest location to me was Fashion Square.  What a debacle that one is!  My long-time favorite is their chicken salad on molasses bread.  I could eat this every day of my life.  I have ventured away from it at times, but have always left wishing I had gone with the chicken salad.  But wait, there's a new kid in town...the Big Kid Grilled Cheese with gruyere, white cheddar, and American for the all-important meltiness (yes, it's a word).   And BACON!!!!!!  What bacon can do for a sandwich is mind-boggling.  With their creamy tomato soup, it's a match made in my version of heaven.

Hate to be the Debbie Downer here, but it just wasn't great.  We both ordered pulled pork plates.  The pork was on the dry side and cold.  Not refrigerator cold, but room temperature cold.  We were there for dinner, so maybe it had been smoked quite a bit earlier in the day.  Regardless, it was not great.  The Texas toast was really just thick sliced bread.  But the plus side of dry, cold pork was that the bread didn't get soggy in the box.  I had beans which were still a hair underdone.  I also tried the slaw which I  didn't like at all.  I expected mayo based or at least vinegar based, but it tasted like it was dressed with nothing but oil.  Why my husband opted for the Kraft mac 'n cheese rather than trying their baked version, I'll never know.  But even that is much better when you make it at home.   On the plus side...excellent potato salad.  Mayo dressing with just a hint of mustard, not like the overly sweet crap you get at the deli.  Smore dessert was yummy.  Staff was awesome.  All very polite, and they pack to go orders in front of you, so no surprises when you get home.  Based on all the other positive reviews, I would like to try going again sometime. Maybe lunch would be better.  And maybe I can get my car washed, too.  God knows it needs it.

Thanks to Liz S for giving me the heads up on a Groupon for Circle 6 a few months ago!  My husband and I took took the beginner's class which was a great introduction to the process.  The class was really designed to allow you to see if you're interested in moving forward with future classes.  Although we didn't get to work with color in this particular class, the instructors safely guided us through the steps to make our own glass flowers.  Although it was a group class, we made our flowers one at a time so we each had the complete attention of the instructors.  I was a little nervous I might put someone's eye out with my stick of molten glass, but everyone left in one unburned piece.  You will have to pick up your flowers at a later date at their studio on Roosevelt.  Surrounded by beautiful creations, the studio is a great place to see that your flower is not really that great, and you will need more classes!

I could eat Mexican food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Oh wait, I usually do as green chile is my all-purpose condiment.  Unfortunately, the pickings in Scottsdale are slim.  So I was thrilled when ATS opened a location here, two in fact!  My husband favors this location over Old Town, although it is closer and we've never eaten there to begin with!  Regardless, this location is just fine and they have Mexican Coke in 16 oz bottles!  I usually get tacos because in my mind, corn tortillas over flour erase the calories in the tub of guacamole and large quantities of chips I will also be consuming.  I really like the carne asada, and the chicken is okay, too.  But the Al Pastor is my favorite by a landslide.  So much so that I have to remove a star for not having it on a Saturday afternoon.  I guess it's everyone else's favorite, too.  However, when almost your entire menu is built off of only beef, pork, or chicken, running out of one is kind of a big deal in my book.  But it's so good, I'll come back again and again!

The lines for Jean Phiippe are ridiculous in the morning, but it's a great place for a light breakfast or dessert.  The pastry and desserts are beautiful, but not the best you'll have in your life.  My croissant while flaky, was lacking the buttery richness I expected.  Still very good, but not the best ever.  We also had a chocolate cupcake which was incredibly rich, almost too much so if that's even possible, and a delicious fruit tart of sorts.  It's also a bit difficult to figure out the lines.  In the morning there was one that wrapped around the entire store.  Later, there were two, but no indication if they were for separate types of orders or where they started.  Maybe one was for omelets?  We just got in the one closest to the dessert case to window shop before ordering.

Okay, I could sit here all day and watch 80's videos.  Especially during the day when it's not busy.  My $16 drink will last me longer than $20 in a slot machine, so why not?  The only problem is it can be a bit depressing to realize you watched those videos for the first time 30 years ago.  Yep, those days are gone.

I loved the decor of Avalon so much that I was really happy to see another restaurant take over the space.  So when the unthinkable happened and my husband took a day off of work to spend with me, I picked Sevens for breakfast.  With the exception of one other table, we had the restaurant to ourselves.  I was surprised to see a bartender at 10 am on a Monday morning, so my husband put him to work with a Bloody Mary which received high marks.  I talked myself out of a mimosa and was glad I did because my orange juice was not only not fresh squeezed, it tasted like concentrate.    As much as I wanted Sevens to be my favorite breakfast spot, it needs a little work.  I like crispy hash browns, but these were so overdone there was no sense of a potato left.  But our main complaint was the level of salt used.  My husband ordered the Meat Lovers Benedict and instantly commented it was too salty.  Well, with jalapeno bacon, canadian bacon, and prosciutto, I thought it was somewhat understandable, but the egg and hollandaise should have balanced it out a little.  With my own breakfast, I would discover the problem with his...the pork green chili.  I ordered a breakfast burrito described as filled with "eggs, hash browns, italian sausage, and cheese, drenched with green pork chili and topped with shredded cheese".  Actually the chili was inside the burrito, so I'm completely not understanding the sausage (I substituted bacon).  And there was no shredded cheese on top, instead it  was their jalapeno cheese sauce.  I liked the sauce, but I think a dish ought to be prepared as described on the menu.  But the problem again was that it was salty to the point that a lesser eater would not have gotten it down.  Upon tasting the components, hash browns really salty.  Bacon exceptionally salty, even for bacon.  Green chili over the top salty.  Had this been served alone, I would have actually sent it back and ordered something else, and that's something I never do.  But I had a $20 gift certificate, so I didn't complain since we were really only paying for drinks.  For the good.  The menu is perfect in my book for breakfast with a nice combination of savory and sweet dishes, and some southwest items tossed in the mix.  The lemon ricotta pancakes almost had me, and I would still love to try them.  The service was excellent.  All the staff was friendly.  Our server was attentive.  You couldn't ask for more there.   And the prices are really good.  Most breakfast dishes $7-$8, nothing over $9.  I just don't know that I want to consume a week's worth of sodium in one meal again.  But I might be persuaded to come back for dinner when there might be another chef.

3.5 stars.  First, I would like to thank SRP for the monster power surge that set fire to the electrical board in my dryer.  They shall be receiving my gratitude in the form of a claim for $300.  Naturally, I discovered the problem on a Friday afternoon.  My first call to another highly rated appliance repair business resulted in an answer of "I can probably get to it Monday or Tuesday.  Text me your information."  Apparently, he was too busy to collect my information or actually give me an appointment.  Not to mention it would take me 27 minutes to text my address & phone on my flip phone as well as a refresher course on how to type a number.  Forget it.  So I called Appliance Works.  They actually tried to work me in the same afternoon, but when the repairman got tied up on another call, they promptly called to let me know he would have to come the next day, a Saturday.  And he did come in the window I was given.  Although I assumed it was the board, he stated it was only a blown fuse and would be a mere $130 to repair.  Unfortunately, he had to leave for over an hour to get the fuse.  After he came back, he realized it was the board and would really be $270.  He forgot that a Frigidaire had to be tested differently.  I could forgive that since he was relatively young.  The kicker was that the part would not be in until the following Friday.  I expressed I could not wait that long and was considering just buying a new set.  It was only after we asked if there was any way to get the part sooner that he offered to have it expressed.  It was to get here on Tuesday.  Tuesday came and went, and I did not hear from Appliance Works, so I called on Wed morning.  The gal I spoke with contacted the technician and through some miscommunication advised me the tech did not know if the part was in.  I wasn't happy about paying an extra $30 for rush unnecessarily.  She had the tech call me himself and he clarified the part had come in on Tuesday, but not until late.  He was going to confirm the right part had been ordered before calling.  He did follow up and came that evening to fix it.  Again, he was on time and the repair was made at the quoted price.  He also gave me a detailed receipt so that I can file a claim.  Although there were a few snags, Appliance Works was very accommodating in scheduling me promptly.  I would definitely use their service again.

Pork tacos, beef tacos, shrimp tacos, chicken tacos, short rib tacos, grasshopper tacos.  Yep, grasshopper tacos, but not until 2:15 so I didn't have one.    Most all the teams competing provided generous samples for only 1 ticket ($2).  With nearly 30 teams, I could not possibly try them all but found a few favorites and restaurants I'll be trying soon (Fuego Bistro and SWB).  And thanks to all the teams that provided adequate eating essentials such as plates and napkins (shame on you Fuego-I loved your incredibly juicy pork taco but it soaked through the paper thin napkin you served it on after the first bite requiring my hand to be the depository for all the drippings).  The big open bar for drinks was adequately staffed (and shaded).  I loved my Paloma (Squirt and Tres Agaves Reposado) and my husband's Firefly Sweet Tea Lemonade (with sweet tea vodka) was surprisingly good.  The not so good...There was no shade except for the VIP tent and the beverage area.  Without a breeze, it was getting hot by early afternoon, so we left before any of the judging.  But for a first year event, I'm a fan!

I'm still a fan of the event itself and most of the tacos were quite good for $2.  The vendors were spread out a little more this time, too, which was nice.  But even though there were more tables this year and umbrellas, there still was not nearly enough seating or shade.  With as much empty space as there was, I don't understand it.  If you're going to hold an event in October when it's almost guaranteed to be 100 + degrees, people (namely me) need a place to sit and get out of the sun.  My taco eating experience was cut far too short because it was just too hot to eat much.    Yes, there is a VIP tent for $100.  But this gets you only the food and drink inside the tent (Macayo's), not the tacos which, correct me if I'm wrong, are the reason we're there in the first place!  Also the alcohol choices were more limited this year.  Where was my Squirt drink I loved so much?  Only beer and margaritas this year.  Unless they move the location indoors or hold it later in the year, not sure I'll return next year.  I think it would be worth the $60 or so the two of us spent had I not succumbed to heat exhaustion before I used up all my tickets.  Knocking off a couple stars because the organizers should have figured this all out last year.

We've used Dukes of Air twice now.  The first time was for a routine a/c check, and it was a 3-week wait.  Because of that, I was concerned about calling them when the unit broke in August, but to my surprise, they got a tech out the same morning.  Turned out the coils were frozen.  Had I known that, I would have slept on the roof next to them.  We opted to just replace the 13-year old unit and were able to schedule a new unit delivery in 3 days.  Luckily it wasn't super hot that week.  We did get a quote from another company that was actually $2000 less for the identical unit, but my husband was more comfortable with these guys.  The unit came on schedule, and the techs that came for the installation met all my expectations.  However, the first tech that did the quote failed to order a transition, so a 3-hour job turned into 7 because the installers had to wait for it to be fabricated.  Also, that same tech that measured the return grilles apparently sent the wrong sized ones anyway.     I also am not a huge fan of the customer care plans which guarantee service within 24 hours.  Although our purchase included a one-year agreement, I think if I spend $9000 with their company, I should get that courtesy regardless.  However, the installers did do a nice job (my husband went up on the roof to check it out), they have someone to answer their phone at all times, and they filed both our SRP rebate and registered the warranty for us promptly.  For this, I'm a fan.  What I am not a fan of is our first full electric bill did not yield much savings, so it's still a mystery why our bills are twice what they should be:(  Update:  Wow!  Within minutes of posting, I got a call from John, the owner.  He was very familiar with my minor service issues because Robert, the installer, had taken the time to relay the glitches to him.  He also assured me that the proper steps were taken to size our unit beforehand with available tools that didn't necessarily require window measurements, etc.  We also discussed the customer care plan, and he clarified that even without a maintenance plan, any problems with my unit would be addressed promptly.  It's primarily routine maintenance that is prioritized by these plans.  It is clear from our conversation that Dukes of Air makes customer satisfaction their #1 concern.  I will continue to use their services and recommend them to others!

Yep, I love it!  In fact, I have found my new favorite cocktail, the Grapefruit Ginger wine cooler.  I do not care that I am not supposed to have grapefruit juice.  It is so worth it.  I started with 5 stars for this drink.  As for the pizza.  I apparently like roasted brussels sprouts, at least when paired with pancetta, manchego, and garlic.  The Manifesto was not to be outdone, though. Schreiner's sausage, mushrooms, goat cheese...a big ole slice of good.  My husband, the pizza purist, gave high marks to the pepperoni, too!  And these are good-sized pizzas.  Three pies for three people was ridiculous, but we all wanted something different.  My arm did not have to be twisted to take the leftovers.  I only wished we had tried the polenta sticks.  Next time.

Somehow on the way to pick up sandwiches for dinner, we ended up at Pig & Pickle.  We should plan on sandwiches for dinner more often!  There was quite the age range of customers which must be a testament to the quality of food.  I also must be in the upper range since I did notice it was extremely loud.  Definitely not a place for a quiet, romantic dinner.  But a great place for a great cocktail and equally great meal.  I had to forgo the cocktail instead having a boring sparkling water with lime.  But I was pleased to see mussels on the menu which is one of my favorite lighter meals.  It was a decent sized portion for a modest price of $15.  Served in a rich and flavorful broth of white wine, tomatoes, and creme fraiche with plenty left for soaking into your bread (I ordered extra bread).  I did get a grain of sand in a couple of them, but overall it was a nice dish.  My husband had the bone-in pork chop cooked perfectly with the slightest hint of pink still there.  He also gave a thumbs up to the accompanying succotash.  As for the oven roasted bone marrow he ordered, I did not go there.  It was a significantly smaller portion than served at Searsucker, but was also priced quite a bit lower at $9.  He did like it, however.  I should also note, service was excellent!  In fact, all the servers seemed to be doing a great job!

My new fave Indian place in my 10-mile radius!  Anyone who remembers the fried cauliflower from the long-gone Taj Mahal may be happy to know it exists at Karaikudi.  It's actually not on the menu, but when we tried to order another cauliflower dish, we were told of the "Chef's Choice" appetizer.  Our eyes lit up as if we had just seen freakin' Santa Claus when the dish arrived and it was fried cauliflower in a spicy chile sauce.  The paneer pakora tasted bland in comparison.  Dosa, which is nothing more than a big crepe, was new to me.  The masala dosa is a meal in itself.  Maybe it's meant to be.  I've only ordered chicken dishes from the menu, Makhani and Khorma and both were flavorful and most importantly, devoid of all non-edible, non-discernable chicken parts.  The medium spice level does seem to really be "medium," but even my husband's "hot" lamb vindaloo was tolerable.  The only time we ordered the buffet was Mother's Day, and that was all that was offered.  It had quite a large selection including lamb chops.  Not sure how much variety is on the standard buffet, but I would like to try it sometime.  And not to be forgotten, the garlic naan was toasty and garlicky.  What else can I say?  I'm a fan.

Started out for lunch at Goldie's next door and somehow ended up with brunch at Voila!  What a great change of plans!  We both had quiche (mine Lorraine, his salmon)...rich, buttery, perfect!  The salad was a nice accompaniment to balance it out.  Service was a bit slow, but that's a plus when you eat with my husband.  Everything becomes fast food.  Are you done?  Are you done?  Uh, no, if I'm still chewing, chances are good I am NOT done.  They also have a nice little patio, but really, that's not much of a draw for the next 4 months.  Their dinner menu looks promising as well...I saw scallops and puffed pastry mentioned.  The rest was a blur.

Hmmm.  I thought I had reviewed H (I can't say it, much less type it) before.  Oh well.  I was a patron when they were on McKellips and loved it...loved the food, loved the prices!  It was sad when they moved, and somehow in my mind, they had moved waaaayyyy far away.  When I finally looked at a map recently, I was kicking myself.  All this time, I could have been delighting in their little street tacos, the spicy green tamales, and the perfect al pastor wrapped in anything!  I'm kicking myself again!

I was ordering my husband a birthday cake online, and hadn't even realized Nothing Bundt Cakes opened this location.  Much more convenient for me!  Wait, that's probably a bad thing.  The cake was fabulous as usual.  I ordered extra petals of icing and that was probably overkill.  But how I love that cream cheese icing.  The cake lasted several days in the fridge, and that was with me home alone all day...just me and that cake.  That's impressive any way you look at it.

While I should be excited about my first trip to a country that does not border the US, I'm not.  With back pain lasting a month and counting, all I can think of is a 10-hour plane ride and 10 days riding in a car.  Both preferable to having to get up and walk around.  But thankfully, there is a store for everything in the Valley.  David helped me find a Tempur-Pedic lumbar cushion that I can use until my thoracic spine hurts too much.  Then I can switch to my Tempur-Pedic travel pillow until my lumbar spine is done.  At that point, I can move to my inflatable pillow that I can use vertically.  He also suggested a blunt object to stab in my eye to help me forget about my back when all else fails.  Well, not really, that was my idea.  I also tried out a few of the Tempur-Pedic beds.  Expecting it to feel like the foam mattress pads you buy at Wal-Mart, I was shocked at how comfortable they are and with a 20-year life!  It could outlast me.  There was one that when adjusted to the right spot, I was virtually pain free.  Now, it's just a matter of whether I really want to spend $8000 on a piece of furniture that I will only enjoy when unconscious.  It was a really nice bed though.

Yum on the food.  Kind of weird on the service.  My husband and I are like old people.  Actually, in Yelp circles, we probably ARE old people.  We usually eat dinner out pretty early (to avoid crowds), and this was no exception.  We came in around 4 to an empty restaurant.  There was an open booth in the bar we wanted, but the hostess did not want to relinquish due to a 5:30 reservation??  We were out before it was ever occupied.  So we agreed to a table in the restaurant, but she had to check, double-check, and triple-check the reservations?? Maybe 2 parties came in before we left.  I didn't get it, but anyway...  We ordered spiced olives at only $3 on happy hour menu.  I didn't detect any spice, but holy moly, it was like they dumped an entire jar in that bowl!  Spice or no spice, I love olives!  We ordered the cheese board from the happy hour menu as well.  Not overly inspiring, but hey, it's cheese and bread.  Can't go wrong there.  Oddly, when our server presented it, he didn't know whether the jam was tomato or bacon??  Shouldn't he know?  It was bacon!  We also split the daily pizza which was a variety of cheeses and delicious, and a pasta dish (the name escapes me), but it was basically hand made pasta in a butter sauce.  So much sauce that I longed for more pasta or bread to soak it up.  Cheese, pasta, and butter.  The three staples in my diet...which explains a lot.  Easy 4 stars!

Yay to LGO for a wonderful event!  More sweets than one can imagine...big cakes, mini cakes, cookies the size of frisbees, gelato, champagne, and English muffins.  What else do you need?  I did not know what all the hoopla about the muffin was until I had mine from the gift bag the next day.  So much for my 100-calorie multi-grain Thomas English muffins.  And that salted chocolate chip cookie?  I can never again eat a cookie not bathed in salt.  Since I was trying to control myself during the event, I appreciated the gift bag with take-home treats.  They even included gift cards!  I was also thankful my husband had to go out of town on business as he would have taken up space, and the event was a bit too crowded to be fully enjoyed.  I didn't get the chance to talk to the folks at LGO or my fellow Yelpers as much as I would have liked.  That's the only reason I'll go with 4 stars for this one.  I was a little disappointed that I couldn't use my gift cards this morning, though.  English muffins-not included.  Pre-packaged cookies-not included.  They are only good for pastries out of the case.  So I ordered a brownie and a cookie from the case-not included either.  So be sure to ask what constitutes a "pastry" before you order.  I ended up just paying for my items, rather than getting things I didn't want or shouldn't have.  But big thanks to Lindsey and LGO for a wonderful event!

Yay!  A Smashburger closer to me!  Burgers are always fresh, and I love the smash.  No shrunken patties that become a thick glob of meat.  Not only does it stay nice and uniform, but it has the wonderful sear as well.  I always go with the Classic Smash, although I was able to sample some of their other options at a recent event.  I was shocked I liked the black bean patty!  The toppings are always fresh, too.  No wilted lettuce here.  And their fries are really good, too!    The employees always provide great service, and seem happy to have a customer.  A novel concept in this industry.  Thank you!

Beautiful Shannon M's last gift to me before she left.  The gift of another pizzeria to enjoy in her absence.  I liked the floor plan with the inside/outside bar.  Clearly I am behind in my reviews because I have not seen outside in several months.  We shared two pizzas and a fried calzone (the Vesuvio) among 3 of us.  It was all pretty great.  I did have to ask what a few of the ingredients were, but the server was more than willing to educate me with enthusiasm.  There's also a small grocer on one side where you can pick up a quick lunch or ingredients to use at home.  Definitely worth a return visit!

Went there with some dear friends a few months ago when we found out Shabu Fondue is closed on Mondays.  Then returned with my husband a few weeks later.  Although I basically ate the same things on both trips, I guess I can say they are consistent.  My favorite dish was the hot and sour soup with shrimp.  I expected it to taste like the usual you find in every Chinese restaurant.  I was sorely mistaken.  Theirs is so much lighter, very spicy, but less on the sour.  I also tried the kobe pho which I did like, but it seemed boring compared to the hot & sour.  We also tried the pork gyoza and spring rolls, both very good.  My surprise of the night was the fried tofu my friend suckered us into ordering.  One, I hate tofu.  Two, see number one.  Well apparently, much as the State Fair has figured out, you fry anything and it becomes delicious, especially with the dipping sauces.  In fact, it kind of reminded me of paneer.   Unfortunately, what's also consistent is service.  Not terrible, but could be better.  My husband and I asked for small bowls since we were sharing the soups.  We had to ask twice.  I ordered a bottle of sparkling water and had to ask for a glass.  It was a one litre bottle.  Just little things that could be better, but overall, I really enjoyed both visits.  Oh, and they run anime movies on big screens behind the bar.  My husband loved that.

Truth to be told, I am not a fan of sushi, any sushi.  Not caring for raw fish or sticky rice, I'm pretty much SOL in this department.  However, because I am a fantastic wife that allows her husband to choose a restaurant on his birthday, I've learned to live with it.  My secret is looking for shellfish and avocado and drowning the poor bastard (the sushi, not my husband) in soy sauce.  So, we arrive at Akita.  I like the name.  It reminds me of a big fluffy dog.  I like it that I can inspect the plates as they pass by on the little conveyor.  If this was a concept at a Mexican restaurant, I would weigh an easy 400 pounds.  I wished there were a menu available of what was in each roll, but no worries, if I didn't like it, birthday man would eat it.  And actually, my visual assessment of the ingredients was pretty good.  I liked everything I chose.    Although our drink order was taken promptly, I did have to ask for them when it became clear it was never going to happen.  I can only imagine it was an oversight, as the restaurant was not busy.  My only real complaint is that there were huge gaps on the belt.  I get it that since it wasn't busy, they didn't want to overload it with food that wouldn't be served in time.  But the spacing should have been better.  At times, it took a good 10 minutes for anything to pass by.  I also would have preferred fewer pieces on a plate.  Most plates had at least 4 pieces of sushi.    But overall, for a newly opened place, great job!  And for $35, we had a stack of plates.  My husband was a fan as well.  Hopefully, he'll write his own review.  But I'm not counting on it.  My work is never done.

First time here since Dozo closed, and I find it just as good.  "And I know good sushi," because I saw it on Food Network and my husband was stationed in Japan...before I ever met him.  Actually, I don't know sushi.  I just thought I would say it to see how it felt.  Not good.    In fact, I'm not a sushi lover, and there was a time I wouldn't eat it at all.  But it's grown on me.  Although I've yet to graduate to sushi rolls with raw fish as the main ingredient, I have moved to where I can handle a little tuna as long as there's some other stuff in there to hide it.  But even this non-sushi eating diner finds some good things on the menu.  My favorite roll of the night was...well I can't remember the name of it and their website is down...I think it was the shy guy or something along those lines.  And with that, I conclude this exceptionally useful review.  I guess I should take better notes, or any notes for that matter.

This was my second event I was fortunate enough to attend at Capital Grille, and this one was as fabulous as the first.  Much more intimate with only 30 guests or so, and CG pulled out all the stops to introduce us to their summer event, The Generous Pour, where you can enjoy 7 wines with your dinner for only an additional $25.  But in Yelp style, we were privileged to taste 3 white wines and 3 red, each paired with one of 6 perfect tastings.    All of the pairings were brilliant, and I was surprised to really enjoy the Carmel Road "Liberated" Riesling which had just a hint of sweetness.  My favorite bite of the evening was the scallop with sweet corn risotto.    And as one can expect, the staff at Capital Grille were top notch professionals and service was flawless.  They also generously provided a few incentives to return later.  So thank you to our awesome CM, Lindsey, who works tirelessly to pull these events together and to Capital Grille for opening your doors and providing us the same wonderful experience you do for all your patrons.

I loved Adela's!  Small, neighborhood restaurant that's very cute inside despite it's strip mall location!  We started with the fried calamari.  Now you should really like calamari to order this because it is not fried to an unrecognizable food that could be anything...zucchini, cheese, a shoe.  I really liked the spicy marinara it was served with as well.  My husband had the baked ziti of which there was little left.  I had the special of lobster ravioli.  Really good, although I was surprised there were shrimp on top.  The server did not mention that.  But when I overheard another server, I realized we got the abridged version of the specials in general.  But she was very nice and attentive.  And the tiramisu was very good as well.  Will definitely return.  Maybe tomorrow in fact!

Although I have not actually eaten a full meal here, I'm going to award my movie-going experience with the coveted 5th star.  I'm actually hesitant to write a review for fear everyone will know what I know, and I'll have to start buying tickets online and dealing with that nonsense.  But then again, if no one goes, I'll be out of luck in 6 months.  So what do I love?  1. Ticket prices are a very reasonable $12.50 for evening showings, and I believe they are $9.95 for weekdays.  Compare this to the new Harkins at Fashion Square which is a far less desirable theater in my opinion, yet is substantially more expensive. 2.  Popcorn is served in a bowl with butter, not butter flavoring.  Only one price $7 ($8 for specialty) and it's all you can eat.  In fact, you can bring your bowl back at the end and they will give you a giant bag to take home.  And I am not kidding when I say giant. 3.  Comfortable recliners and all seating is love seats (a pair with a moveable arm rest between them). And the pair next to you is spaced appropriately.  No shared cup holders.  You don't feel like you're lying in bed next to a stranger (again, Harkins missed this).  And the theaters are relatively small. 4.  Back to the food, or the drinks.  $3.95 for standard fountain drinks of 32-oz with unlimited refills. But I'm a fan of the keg root beer for $4.95 which includes only one refill, but is more than plenty.  And yes, never fear drunkards, a full bar is available. 5.  Other fun snacks like gelato creations, gourmet candies, soft pretzels (think pub, not kiosk), not to mention full blown meals.  And speaking of meals.  If you don't want to eat in your seat, the lobby has service and seating as does the patio.  What don't I love?  The popcorn is a double-edged sword.  I don't always get it because I know I will feel I must eat $7 worth.  I would LOVE if they offered a single serving option.  Take a couple bucks off and give me no refills.  Use a different colored bowl or a bag.  Something.  Don't make me sad that I have to say no.
