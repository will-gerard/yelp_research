I have been coming out to Turf a few times a season for the last couple years. As a fairly seasoned horse racing fan, I will give you the real. Yes, its old, old as the people who are here on a everyday basis. The building needs an upgrade but the vintage/classic look has more upside than you would think The food is not the greatest, its a horse track. Even if your a baller spending about $9 for a fancy spot, the food is still avg, because its a horse track, in Arizona! I would suggest having lunch before you come and maybe have some popcorn or a hotdog to help with the booze. The Booze, oh yeah, should get to that. Stay away from the draft beer inside, not sure the last time they cleaned the taps but I won't make the mistake of a draft again. Mixed drinks are typical, outside you can get a pretty good bloody mary between $5-$7. Speaking of outside, if you are with a group that is just hanging for the afternoon, hang out at the bars outside for the awesome cost of $2 admission, can't beat it. Now when it comes to the betting, if you are looking to make a lot of money, would suggest looking at the tracks on the TV's inside, your payout is based on how much is put on the type of bet within that race, and at Turf, its not a lot. Best way to make a lil money is group your bets with friends and double down, but watch your kitty, only bet 10% of your betting money total per race..Just a thought. Also, Turf is so up and down you are prolly best just betting on a horse by its name, real talk. So don't get your hopes up and expect the worst and you will have blast.

AMAZING!!!!!!! My fianc√© is from Minnesota so we were looking for a place for the Vikings and found this place via YELP!!! This is the place to be if your a Vikings fan in the Easy Valley.  We started coming here I believe Week 2 of the 2014-2015  season and have been back just about every week since. I am from Michigan and sorry to say am I big Lions fan. I gave my bar up per our weekly switch-off(as a true loving couple would do) to come here weekly, that's how fun it is.  The owners Steve and Renee will remember you name and maybe your order if you tip well. Great people that provide a no frills good time. No food other than 2 pizza choices, a true Minnesota bar, during the games they have a pot luck. Yes, you bring something and have Renee set it up in the back. You can expect all the northern favorites; chili, pickle roll-ups, chicken wings, cheese trays, lil smokies etc.  Booze, super cheap!!(cash only, atm onsite) Great Beer selection, lot of local and national crafts along with norms. Great choices for you mixed drinkers out there also.  If you are coming for a Football Sunday, they do have the package, but only 5 TVs. Yes, you read that correct. Place can only hold 100 people according to the sign on the wall. But 4 at least will be on the Vikings game, if you're lucky and catch Steve in a good mood he may put one (above the jukebox) on your game (no sound). With that being said if your team is playing against the Vikings, it's also a good time.  All around a great place with great people, so happy we found this place, we found friends for life!

We figured out today that both brake lights were out on our car. Called this location to see if they had the item on hand, which they did. Donald helped me on the phone and greeted me also once I arrived to the store. He was very friendly and had already had the lights waiting for me at the register.  After signing up for the rewards program they offer and paying for the lights, Donald also installed the lights for us!!!  Excellent customer service!!!!! Thank you Donald again for getting us back on the road safely.

Had Ted's for dinner this evening. Flew back from Minnesota this afternoon and wanted a hot dog real bad. I had a foot long with chili, mustard and onions. The lady had polish with peppers and mustard. Small fries and a milkshake. Wow. Excellent choice, everything is made to order,great service. Will be coming back more often.

We've only been here a handful of times but it is a nice place with good food and great beers. Never been here on a Sunday but I've heard it is a Vikings bar which is legit. When we go we do prefer to sit outside, perfect for hot sunny Arizona days! Friendly staff, great atmosphere and people watching!

We ordered from this place last Friday because we got an ad on our door saying they deliver BEER!!! Was trying to stay in that night and Gus's Pizza made that possible.  We moved here from Chicago and have had plenty of pizza in NYC over the years and I honestly don't understand the negative reviews about this place. Maybe the staff saw how the company was being looked at on here and made some changes, I say that because we were very impressed.  We ordered a large pizza with bacon and pep, along with a order of Garlic Knots and a 6 pack of Bud.  The guy on the phone was very polite and made sure he got our order correct, he said it would be 45mins to an hour, expected for a Friday night.  35mins later our pizza and beer shows up. The delivery guy was a little off, maybe had a "pick me up" to get through his shift, but needless to say, he did his job in a timely matter.  The pizza was amazing!!! Hot, Fresh, Good Crust. I never eat crust, and I killed this crust. Yeah, Clean plate club over here. It even heats up well.  Most of the reviews are not good, but we tried this place before even reading a review and we loved it. I say, give it another shot.   Oh yeah, 24hr delivery.

Chase Field is one of the nicest baseball stadiums in the country. Would be better if the product on the field its self was better, but that's another story. I come out a few times during the baseball season and it's always a good time. NEVER sells out, I have gotten tickets many ways and the best deal is from the scalpers across the street, tickets are legit, cops are right there so you don't have to worry. Once inside, you have a ton of food, snack and treat options. Multiple full bars and beer options every 15ft. Chase Field also has the cheapest beer in all of baseball so that works also. If you are a baller, get the pool for your friends or kids and make a day of it. Overall A in my book.

I stayed here in early December and it was worth every penny! This hotel is old, young, fun, smoky and has some of the best people watching in Vegas. If you are a middle-class american between the ages of 25-30, just trying to get smashed in Vegas this your hotel. If you have children, loaded and not in Vegas for fun reasons, you will hate this hotel. The deluxe rooms remind you of a Super 8, I had a room in tower 5 over the Carnival Club, yes, its loud, very loud, till 3am and starts again at 12pm the next day. If your in your room to complain, your fault, I loved it, with the balcony, great for drinking and getting ready in your room, which that is all you should be doing..well.... The main bar in the lobby pours a nice 7sec, 4bucks all mixed drinks, can't start your night off any better. They also have Dealertainers, blackjack dealers dressed as celebrities, and bust out in song randomly throughout the night, its awesome. Dolly Parton did me great, 5dollar tables are not bad either.  Friends of mine had the hot tube love room and it is nice. Updated room but your balcony is on the side facing the flamingo as to having a club banging with a full view of the strip and mountains.  The hotel is nothing special, but its worth the price if your not picky. I've stayed in a lot of hotels in Vegas and the reviews for this do not do justice for this hotel. The staff was great, 15mins to check in with a line on a Friday evening, the room was clean, old but clean.  I will stay here again in April, more money for me to gamble with.

I recently stayed here for the 2nd time last week for my 30th birthday celebration. We arrived at the hotel on a Friday morning around 10am. Damon, the front desk clerk that took care of us, took care of us. He was extremely nice and professional. Once we mentioned it was my birthday, he upgraded us to a strip view room and also didn't charge us for an early check-in. Great way to start a fun-filled weekend.  Once we got into our room, everything was gravy from there. They do charge $5 for a wine opener, but its classic Flamingo and its a good take home item. Ha  The liquor store in the lobby is like your own personal grocer. The ladies will remember you and always keep tabs on your wins/losses.   Bugsy's Bar on the main floor is the place to be Saturday night about 4am. It goes down, everything from drunk golfers to strippers getting yelled at. Quite the seen.  I stayed here, I played here, I won here. Enough Said on the gambling aspect.  Had a blast, will stay here again, and again.  Viva La Flamingo.

Was here this past Saturday night for a friends bachelor party.Not sure about all the negative reviews, but we had a blast. We showed up at 11pm.   The line was out of control, like Disneyland. It was 8 of us total, all GUYS. Walked up to a promoter, offered us bottle service starting at $350per bottle, which included the $50 cover and we didn't have to wait in line.  Less than $100 per person for 2 bottles(liters) of Grey Goose. We ended up getting some buckets of beer also, still a cost efficient evening.  The crowd was great, the service staff was on point and the DJ was playing some hits, I do agree with another reviewer about how the DJ would only play small snippets of songs, not enough time to get into it. but other than that we had a great time.  Outside of Vegas I heard nothing but good things about LAX and that is also all I and my group experienced, the place is older but it still has its Vegas magic. Unless your extreme upper class, you have nothing to complain about.   I'll be back, thanks LAX.

Came into town Friday night for a Bachelor/Birthday Celebration. It was my friends birthday and we made sure to tell the guy at check-in. He ended up moving us to a Strip View Bella Suite on the 42nd Floor, it was quite epic. 2 level room, 3 TV's and a great view of the pirate show at TI.   Great Hotel, nice people, good times.

My girlfriend and I stopped in here on our way home from an event in Scottsdale. I wanted to try this place for awhile. I listen to Sports talk radio and I always hear the commercials for this place.  It was a Thursday night and the place had a decent crowd, TVs for days, pool tables and arcade games.  The beer was cold, the servers were nice, and the prices were not bad at all.   We will be trying this place out during football season, I counted 37 TVs just from the bar, I can only imagine this place on a Sunday.  Also, we noticed they have in-house drivers to take you home if you get wasted. More bars should follow this idea, we will use it for sure in the future.

This is an update to my previous review, we came here yesterday for NFL Week 1 and we enjoyed ourselves very very much. Got to the bar at 9:30am, walked up to the door and they had a tv map already done outside so you know exactly where your game was being showed, we were there for Lions/Vikings and they had it on in the lounge with sound.   Got in early enough to grab a seat on the couch that made our experenice that much better. Our server(s) were as prompt as they could be seeing it was very busy.   The crowd was upbeat and fun and the atomsphere was great.  We will be back for Weeks 3-17, since I'll be at the game next Sunday here.  Go Lions!!!

2 Stars, that is for the gas, it's always at a great price. The staff is pretty nice, but slow, not really in a rush to help you unless there is more than 6 people in line. The store its self is really dirty, really dirty, the soda area looks like 10 5yr old kids just ran through it like it was a free for all sugar rush. The hotdogs, ew.  Other than that, typical booze prices and a great place to see what your co-workers drinks of choice are, true because you will be in line long enough to see someone you know.

Ok, this was our 2nd time coming here ever. The 1st was last year before the last Lions/Cards game. At that time, the place was rocking, the food was flowing and the bartenders were very attentive. They even had a Bacon Bloody Mary that my girlfriend loved!! So on that note, we came back, why did we do that?  We get there about 10:15(NFL Sunday) and we were told that the kitchen didn't open till 11am, makes very little sense because the games start at 10am. Whatever, hit us with some chips and salsa for the time being.....  Server comes to us and lets us know that the kitchen is open and that we can place an order....7mins later, sorry, I was wrong kitchen is closed and you get even put in a order till 11am.....Okay.  My friend had the Chicken Quesadilla, didn't like it too much, something with off with the chicken. She ordered another one with just cheese and pico, that took about 45mins.  I have never looked at the reviews for this place and couldn't believe I didn't see these before, only because we were so hung-up on the Bacon Bloody, we didn't even think twice about it, oh yeah about that Bacon Bloody, the server told us that it didn't sell, to the point where they just gave it away for free...That's smart.   Not sure what the deal is, but if your gonna fail, do it in the summer, at least try to get it together for Football Sunday, the one day you can make a profit. We will not be returning.

I work for Wells Fargo across the street, and with a limited lunch schedule Jimmy Johns has always came through for me in clutch. I have never spent more than 3mins in the location no matter what time of day I arrived. That is a serious plus.  The subs themselves are hard to mess up, I mean really....If you have something negative to say about a sub from JJ or Subway, just make it yourself...  Thanks Jimmy.

We ordered here for only the 2nd time last night and sorry to say it will be our last time.  My girlfriend ordered a pizza, salad and a brick of burnt wheat they tried to pass off as bread-sticks.  The pizza and salad were okay, not bad, but not great. The bread-sticks on the other hand were bad. We are not the ones to complain often but the experience after we discovered the burnt brick is what gets this review.  I call Oliveo after we realized that we were not going to be enjoying our bread-sticks to see if we can get another order, I was willing to pick it up if that were an option to save them from making another 0.8 mile drive to our place, but no.  The first guy put me on hold for 3mins and proceeded to put me on with a manager that barely spoke English and had the nerve to tell me they make the bread in the morning(its 6:30pm) and that that is how it comes out, there was nothing he could do....Never once said sorry or even attempted to make it right.   I could tell he was uneasy on the phone and didn't know what to do, so I can only assume he was not a manager or just didn't care, before he could continue to stumble his words to give me more reasons why I paid for bullshi*, I just told him its all good and I'll just take my business elsewhere.  What really sucks is that we moved here from Chicago and are trying to support local businesses in our area but crappy service like this is why people here are stuck on chains, maybe we were better off ordering Papa John's.

This place has been a staple for my girlfriend and I since we moved here a little more than a year ago.  We admittedly only come on Taco Tuesday's but whatever.  $2 Large Goblets of PBR all day, everyday and $1.50 tacos, they are worth every penny even at  full price of $2.49.   Nice atmosphere and everyone working is usually pretty friendly. The only compliant I would have is that the front counter girls are a bit too nice. There is no reason for the entire line to be held up so someone can call their friend (via cellphone) from the patio to bring her ID up so the other on can buy more than one beer. Send that mess to to back of the line, really.  As for the tacos: Steak, YES Fish, YES Shrimp, YES Pork, YES  That's all you need to know.

We come to Lucky Break every Friday for Trivia. Its great. We meant some great people and the host is great also. Food is good. Its better than it use to be and you can tell the owners are trying to make to best of what they have going. Service could be a tad bit better but that will come in time, I hope. Overall good local bar if you live in the neighborhood.

Steak and Shake, the In & Out Burger of the Midwest.  Only Con about this S&S, its too new, its crazy how hi-tech this place is and its funny how everyone working looks like they should be in a Steak & Shake Barbie Commerical.   Selling Burgers not MAC products.  Other than that, you should see me here at least once a month.

Malted Waffles. OMG  No need to even order a meal; just get all the must-haves separate. If you do, the Minimum Wage Meal is the way to go. So good, we love coming here for brunch.  Dog friendly patio, bonus! Nice friendly staff, can get busy on the weekends but that's Normal, get it?  Malted Waffles. Mind Blown
