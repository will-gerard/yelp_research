Went here for my first time in a very long time. Was seated right away. Ordered 2 fish and chips and 2 chowders a Bloody Mary and 3 draft beers. On one fish I asked for the veggies instead of slaw. Only one chowder was brought waiter thought we were going to share, other soup was brought out about 10 mins later after food was brought out. Neither entrees came with the veggies I asked for. The rest of dinner went fine. Bill came out and we were charged full price for soups instead of the add on with dinner price. the waiter tried to say it was because of tax but eventually checked menu and fixed it. We were charged $9.25 per draft beer and no one told us it was because we get to keep the cups it comes in that we never wanted. Had to look over a menu on the way out to double check draft beer prices to find out we get glass cups. Bartender was mad we didn't keep our dirty ones and was ignoring the waiter trying to get us our cups.. Ridiculous. Staff seemed so overwhelmed and it wasn't even that busy. $100 for 2 people for horrible service and average food.

I wish I could give them 0 stars. I have gone to this place plenty of times and always got the pho. I had been begging my mom to come with me to try the pho and finally one day she agrees. Well turns out none of us out of 4 got the pho but I did order something new to me, the curry shrimp. When ordering the waiter asked if I wanted it spicy since it is not spicy at all I said a little would be ok. My food comes out so spicy it made my eyes water and nose run. My mom decided to try some and was angry that i was eating it and insisted I say something. I told the waiter and he offered to bring me some extra sauce with no spice to help balance it. It didnt help much so I asked for a bit more to go and i would attempt to eat it at home since everyone else was done eating. The manager then tells him I have to pay for the extra sauce. So he offers me to speak to the manager and I do. The manager explains this is how much chili flakes is added to a mild meal and basically people have different opinions on spice level, as if I am just being a baby and my food is not that spicy. He also keeps asking "what do you want me to do there is nothing to do. I told the waiter extra sauce wont help" and starts arguing with my entire table. He was beyond rude I was in shock I had never heard anyone at a place of business speak like this to customers before it was obvious he didnt care about our business at all. He never apologized and did not care at all. It was clear I just had to deal with my inedible food. He made it look like I wanted a free meal, but I just wanted an apology some compassion, something. So we eventually paid and left after all the arguing was done. It was embarrassing and rude I was so excited to take my mom there and that is what happens. I will not return. Oh and the next day my mouth was actually sore from how hot the food was and I did not even finish it.

The front desk guy said even though we paid for a room, we are not at any time allowed to have any visitors even if it is our DD coming to get us waiting for another before leaving and then he called the cops on us and kicked us out for having visitors at 11am even though we left until 6am and were not in the room for over 5 hours he considered that against policy of having anyone in the room period. I have never been to a hotel where I am not allowed to have anyone visitors. DO NOT STAY HERE!
