I went here looking for a racquetball glove.  Then I got side tracked and started looking for new racquets, but couldn't find anything that was any good.  The person who greeted me was nice and courteous and while I wouldn't go back for racquetball gear, I might go back for other sporting goods needs.

I've been ordering from Little Caesar's for a long time.  For $5, you cant go wrong, I like the pizza, the service is fast and friendly and they'll make it "Crazy crust" or cook it well done on request.  They sure makes it easy to feed a family of four.

I like bean and cheese burritos.    I haven't tried any other food at Elvira's but the bean and cheese because they're so good.  I always do take-out orders and they're always friendly on the phone and quick with my order.  I don't live close, but I work just down the street, so it's a good place to go for lunch.  If you're looking for a recommendation, this is it.  I'd pick Elvira's over any place.

You know, I'd be happy to give 5 stars to Fry's.  They have a great selection of produce and it is of excellent quality.  They have all the grocery items I could ever imagine wanting.  They are quick at the checkout counters and very convenient to my location.    I would love to give 5 stars, but I have been to Safeway.  And at safeway, when you encounter an employee, they look you in the face and smile and ask if they can help you find anything.  Fry's is great.  I'm a fan, but it's not as good as it gets.  Will I still shop there?  Of course!

Pita Jungle is awesome.   I could stop there, but I won't.    The atmosphere is casual, yet professional.  The staff is laid back and friendly, the kind of people you could just kick back and hang out with.    The food is good, and you get what you pay for.  I love the chicken pasta salad, it tastes great, and there's always some left over for lunch the next day.    I have been impressed at PJ's steady growth, it seems like every time I come back, there's another store opening.  I'd say they're worth a try.

This has always been a great place for me and my buddies to go to blow off steam about the ladies.  Nothing is better for the nerves than shooting a game of pool.  I'm a fan, for sure.

This place is great!  I have a flock of chickens and they need food.  Tempe Feed and Tack is close to my house (of course! I live in tempe...) and the people are super helpful and friendly.  They always load up the 50lb bags of feed and I never have to wait.

If I'm in Tempe and I want a mean bean and cheese burro, this is the place I'm going to go.  To me, there is no better place to get one.

I've been an LA Fitness customer since 2004, I like their gyms.    I don't say this to brag, but I've lifted the 125lb dumbbells for bench press.  The way they have the benches set up in front of the heavy dumbbells completely defies common sense.  They have a chair, not a bench, a chair in front of the heaviest weights.  What do you use a chair for when it comes to db?  db Curls, seated db tricep extension, db military press, db seated shoulder press, maybe some bent over db rows... most of those are not going to require anywhere near the heaviest weight in the gym, and you can do bent over db rows on a flat bench.  Come on LA Fitness! Get your head in the game!

On Thursday 3/28 I received a flyer from Rosatis at work.  Since we have ordered Rosatis pizza in the past and really liked their product we thought it was nice that they had a location so much closer to us now.   Here's why they get 1 star.  We ordered an XL thin crust pizza for delivery and were told it would arrive in an hour and the total was $25.  No problem, that's normal for Rosatis, and quality food takes time.    The delivery guy arrived on time (right at an hour) and was acting kinda weird.  He seemed nervous and set the pizza on the desk.  We signed for it and said thanks.  He just kinda stood there and looked at all of us (there were three in the room).  I asked if there was anything else?  He said "no" and sort of shuffled out, looking at us the entire time.  We took the pizza into the other room and opened the box.  Now it made sense.  The pizza had been in a horrible collision as if it had been dropped and was like a ball of pizza in the corner of the box.  I called to reconcile the problem and explained the situation, expecting we'd get a refund or the next pizza free.  The lady at the other end of the phone said this   "um... sorry."  So I said "ok..." To which she replied "are there any other major complaints?"  So I asked her to get her manager and have him call me back.  The manager called back and apologized and said he'd give us $2 off our next pizza.  So we don't get a free pizza, but if I ever order from that location again I will get a pizza that costs $23.  Thanks for the $2.  I don't think I'll be cashing in on your offer.

Mike from Rosati's sent me a message on yelp! the other day to make restitution.  I called him so we could resolve it directly, but he was out.  The next day I received a call from him and we discussed the circumstances of my last experience with Rosati's.  He apologized and told me that was not the way Rosati's does business.  I told him what I expected, and what I thought most people should expect from a restaurant was a replacement meal (in this case, the pizza) at no cost to the customer.  Mike agreed and left instructions at the restaurant for a future order.  Today we made that order for not one, but two pizzas.  We got one for free, but had to pay for the other, that was expected, but it would have been nice to have the entire order comped.  The driver arrived and apologized for being late.  He said "sorry, they didn't call me".  I asked if the pizzas were cold, he said, "no, they were on the warmer".  So they weren't cold, but they weren't fresh.    I wanted to up my review to 5 stars.  I really did, but I think there is some room for improvement.  The pizza was later than they said, it was warm, but it wasn't fresh.  I was teetering between 3 and 4 stars.  I'm going to be generous and give a 4, because they did give us a free pie (it wasn't as fresh as I like, but it was free...).

My wife had been having serious knee problems that were affecting her ability to run in the morning.  She had tried seeing a doctor, who recommended different shoes, and she tried knee braces that temporarily alleviated the problem, but she still had pain.  We decided to look for a chiropractor.  We looked on google and found Global Chiropractic.  It had good reviews, but I'm skeptical about doctors in general, so I wasn't sold from the get go.  My wife called to verify they'd accept our insurance, and they did, so we tried it out.  After the first visit we were pleasantly surprised to not only have her neck, back, hips and ankles cracked, but Dr. Steve was into full body health.  He made dietary suggestions and within a week she had significantly less pain and after 3-4 weeks hardly any pain at all.    That's what sold me.  I have been blessed with very few health problems in my life, but I had an xray and as it turns out I had some subluxation in my back and neck.  I have been seeing Dr. Steve at Global chiropractic for about a year now and I'm very happy with the results!

I am a big fan of local businesses.  When I go somewhere I don't want to waste a lot of time traveling.    This LA Fitness is right around the corner from my house.  In fact, I have walked there a number of times.  The facility is clean and the staff are nice enough.    They recently remodeled and updated this location, transforming it, imo, from a gym into a fitness club.  I will give them props for changing how they arrange the dumbbells.  Before the remodel they were arranged quite poorly.  If you were lifting 50s and wanted to move up to 55s you had to walk the entire length of the dumbbell rack in order to get your weights. Since the remodel they have added a squat cage, and another squat rack so that eases some of the congestion on leg day.  Factoring in the convenience, the cleanliness and the reorganization of the weights, I rate this 4 stars.

I really like this place.  I mean, I really really like it.  I can eat a bunch of delicious sushi and get completely full and drink a coke and spend less than $15.  The atmosphere is comfortable, the lighting is cozy and the service is good.  The only problem I have is that they're so good at what they do that every time I go I have to wait to be seated.  So maybe they could expand and somehow get more seats.  That's just my opinion.  KU

I don't need much help when I go to home improvement stores, but the Lowe's staff at the rural/baseline location have always been very helpful.  The store is clean and it's very close to my house.  This makes it very convenient for small projects I have to do occasionally.

I've tried just about everything Rubios has to offer. I have liked everything, but my favorite is the fish taco. The service is good, but the tacos, mmmmboy!

I hate to do this, but Hi-Health leaves me no choice. It seems that they are desperately searching for little, seemingly insignificant ways to turn good customers away.   I have been purchasing Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein (5lb) from Hi-Health for years. When I purchase, they give me a $10 discount card, so I kept coming back. However, I have to price match each time, because their store prices are freaking ridiculous.  That being said, when I purchased my protein this afternoon, the store clerk told me I can either price match OR get a discount card.   So here I am, writing this review as a goodbye note to Hi-Health and a hello note to Amazon.com or some other more reasonable supplier.

The concept is great.  You get all-you-can-eat pizza, pasta and dessert for $4.99 (adults) and 2.99 (kids) 3 and under eat free.  I went with my wife and kids this past week, it was good.  The guy who greeted us as we walked in was nice, he said "hi" and explained the way the place works.  He took our order, and let our kids in free.  The staff was helpful, I asked for a couple pizzas that weren't on the buffet and they were out and ready to eat in 5 min. or so.    The only beef I had was that the pizzas on the buffet when we arrived weren't very fresh.  Some of them could have been combined with others to make room for some new pies.  Beyond that, our kids had a blast, we ate as much as we wanted and we left happy.  We'll be returning soon, I'm sure.

We came from LA Fitness. I had been a member for 12+ years and was super happy. With the addition of several children to our family our needs shifted a little bit.   Lifetime has a rock wall, children's play area, a pool, slides, and tons of activities that make going to the gym so much easier!  We're still in our first month, but we're happy!

I'm not normally a fan of attorneys, but after a friend introduced me to Tobler & Associates, I am willing to make an exception.    After talking to Nathan about an accident, he was very concerned and I knew his team would take good care of the situation and make things right.    It's hard to know who you can trust when you get into an accident.  I trust Tobler & Associates.

Let me tell you about my experience at Allison's.  I ordered over the phone for take-out so my wife and I could do dinner and a movie at home.  The gentleman I spoke with was friendly but not overly talkative.  I ordered two pulled pork sandwiches and then asked about the corn souffle.  He said that was his favorite and then told me about it.  I was sold.    When I arrived at the restaurant the food was ready and the cashier was friendly.  The only thing was, it was Pi day.  I wanted a pie, but they were sold out.  Not a big deal, though, they threw in a texas sheet cake for free.    The food was good, the portions were perfect and we will definitely be back!

This place is really great!  I tend to stick to racquetball when I come, but I have been to the clubhouse for weddings, receptions, and just to use the pool.  This place is off the hook!    They have a beach pool!

Little Caesars is a great value, I like the sauce and the pizza tastes decent. This location has a DRIVE THRU!! Talk about game changer. With the $5 hot and ready this makes perfect sense. Super convenient...

I can recommend cook law office for anybody involved in a car accident  I worked with Mr. Cook. He took time  to answer all my questions . If I called when he was busy. he got back to me promptly. He even provided me with his personal cell phone number. I've worked with other attorneys before and never received such excellent service. Jimmy and his staff were wonderful and truly cared about my case. Jimmy Cook is a great personal injury attorney. Thanks for the help!

I met with a representative Scent from above at a breakfast meeting a couple weeks ago and it just so happened that I needed one of my rental properties cleaned.    I had her come by and she was prompt, she listened to my concerns about the house, and she made suggestions.  From the beginning she was very professional and friendly.   When the cleaning crew was finished I got a phone call and went to inspect.  It was beautiful!  I'm very happy with Scent from above and have already referred one of my friends.  I will be referring many more people in the future.
