Really like the dry sauteed soy sauce bean sprout chow fun noodles.  I get take out here 2- 3 times a month -  have not eaten in.  The staff is friendly, helpful, food appears fresh and is ready to go in a heart beat.  It's rather lame they now charge extra for brown rice.  I go here mostly for the noodles, the tofu dishes I've had have been merely ok.  My partner enjoys the sweet and sour pork and kung pao chicken.  If I could do 1/2 stars, I would give Hong Kong House 3 1/2 stars overall - for this review, 3 is too harsh - so 5 stars for the noodles and fast service and the convenience.

Grooming Salon  I've tried many groomers thru out the the valley including other Pet Smarts and this one, is in my view, the best my two aussies have gone to.    Price wise they are competitive, if not a little less than other groomers in town.  My dogs turn out perfect every time they go here.  Sylvia normally grooms them but  I've been happy with all of the groomers here.  When I picked them up a few days ago, all the groomers and stations were busy, all of the dogs looked so picture perfect, I felt I was on a movie set featuring dogs.    The shampoo they use, have my dogs coming out shiny and glossy -  wish my own hair looked this good.  The groomers all seem to like their jobs and are really into what they do.  Every time my dogs get groomed here they get compliments  from every one that sees them.

Finally, thanks to the reviews on yelp, I've found a mani/pedi place that I like, reasonable prices, clean, prompt and good.  I've had Tran twice now and have been happy both times. I like my nails to be oval/natural - no dragon lady nails for me.  I have been all over Central Phoenix for my toes and fingers -  disappointed in most of the places I went.  Really happy with Tran and DV nails.

I had not planned on being a Mac owner.  My family - oh so very sick of me constantly complaining of Vista -  on first an HP, then a Dell, packed me off to the Apple store a month ago and well, now I have a MacBook.  The sales associate helping me pick out the perfect Mac was good enough, even with two perfectly good (except for the Vista) PCs at home, to convince me I needed this computer.  Do I love it? Not yet.  I like it, like it a lot.  I'm especially loving not having Vista issues that I had been having.    I'm enjoying taking the one on one classes  to teach me how to use my Mac.  Each time I take a class - I've had 4 now, I have a different teacher and each one bringing a different spin to my classes.  They are nice, friendly, patient, highly knowledgeable.  They are teaching me so many cool features and applications that I can do on my Mac.  My fave so far is the translator.  I do some business in Mexico - my Spanish is limited - so in just one short month the translator has just been a god send.  The store here at the Biltmore is consistently packed with people, visiting the genius bar, taking group classes or the one on one class and making expensive purchases. I am amazed in this economy just how very busy the store is.    I'm not totally convinced a Mac is the only way to go (almost though) but this store has some of the best customer service I've ever experienced.

Can't believe the good hype this place gets.  Very disappointed. Had heard such good reviews everywhere.  The margaritas, too pricey - served in plastic glasses - were weak and a few steps below lime aid - we waited in the patio - had to get our own drinks and no chips/salsa while we waited for our table -  food was decent but nothing to rave about, really lame to have to pay extras for additional chips and salsa and the forks were ,even though not plastic, like something out of a camping or picnic kit - won't go back - too many other really good Mexican places in the valley."

MJ Bread 5 stars  Fig walnut Bread - over the top good.  Cranberry walnut bread, well, Simply Bread, I feel like a traitor to you but you are now in second place for cranberry walnut bread.    The fruit and nut breads seems to sell out by mid morning or earlier so it's best to call first thing in the morning and ask them to hold a loaf for you.     Tammie Coe Cakes 3 stars  The cupcakes were disappointing - the sweetness overtaking any other tastes/flavors. I like Sprinkles better - better yet, for the very best cupcakes in the world - pick up at Crate and Barrel or Amazon.com, a box or 2 or 3 of Barefoot Contessa's Coconut Crème Cheese Cupcake Mix.  They taste as if made from  scratch, turn out perfectly wonderful and take just minutes to make.  The cookies were too gooey, the banana crème pie and carmel brownies also too sweet - which surprises me, because usually nothing is ever sweet enough for me.    To sum, for fig walnut or cranberry walnut bread, I'll go here.  For cookies, mini rolls, whole grain breads, Simply Bread, and cupcakes a Barefoot Contessa Mix.

It's mainly  the cilantro mousse that keeps me coming back to Padre's or perhaps the black bean soup and the pesto pasta.  Decent sangria and margaritas and consistently good service.  There seems to be something for everyone's tastes on the menu - I've taken picky eaters here a few times and they have always been happy.

It's pretty clear from all the reviews, meat loving barbeque aficionados really like Bobby Q's.   This review is for my fellow vegetarians who for some reason end up here.   Why you say, would a vegetarian even end up here? Well, for one, to keep peace in the family, for the sides, and for my fave salad, a wedge of iceberg lettuce ( I can hear some of your groans, "iceberg lettuce!" "What is she talking about") with house made chunky blue cheese dressing.  This dressing is the best I've ever had -  I usually get a pint or so to take home. The grilled vegies are consistently good as are the baked potatoes and the corn bread.  The mac and cheese is rather average.  Prices are reasonable - portions on the large size.  The little donuts they send you home with are a nice/sweet way to end the meal - but not worth the calories.    The wait staff are fun, friendly, efficient - the camaraderie has a good feel to it.

The traditional look and feel of the Tradiciones brought back many good memories of Mexican restaurants in SoCal in the early 60's.  I even - as a little girl - had an outfit almost exactly like the over the shoulder dresses the waitress were wearing while providing us with great service. Nostalgia aside, the food was disappointing.  Not bad,  just not what i was looking for after hearing good reviews in the AZ Republic and Phoenix New Times.  Should have read the Yelp reviews as well.

Dr. Charles David,Associate Director for Internal Medicine  It's tough for most of us to find a good doc.  Especially if you are new in town or or unhappy with your current physician.  With this in mind, may I suggest Dr.  David.     He's smart.   He listens.    He's compassionate.    He won't give you unnecessary tests.  He's board certified in internal medicine.   He will help you stay healthy.  I've never feel rushed - he is willing to spend as much time with me as I feel necessary.     It's a little bit of nuisance to call for an appointment.  You can't just call the office directly but have to go thru Banner's voice mails, prompts/clicks and finally when you get a real person on the phone, it's answered with a "......you have two callers in front of you, please hold"  Other than this minor annoyance, once you have an appointment you should have little or no wait while in the reception area. I've found everyone in the office prompt, friendly, efficient, smart.  Go see him, you won't be sorry, only healthy and happy.

I find myself stopping by Simply Bread almost weekly for raisin/walnut or cranberry/walnut bread or multi grain and a variety pack of 12 rolls.  The rolls are a nice smaller size, tasty and you never know what might be the the mix.    The cookies -  chocolate chippers, sour cherry oatmeal, chocolate, chocolate chip,  are about as good as any cookie could be.  i have to put them in the trunk of my car or they would be eaten before i get home. They have cookie dough to buy as well.  Simply Bread also slices up their bread, very thin cracker like and toasts them.  These make for great bruschetta, dipping, cheese plates etc.  I find the staff nice, friendly and helpful.

There are many good hair salons in Phoenix.  I've been to some of the best, had good results, but they were just too expensive.  I am so thrilled I responded to an add that looked inviting for Joseph Scott Salon.  Adele is now my new stylist - my hair has never looked better and prices are so reasonable.  I've had her cut, color and style my hair three times now and continue to be pleased each time I go.  Joseph Scott is an absolute gem among vast,  vapid,  full of themselves salons in the valley.

I too, highly recommend the Arizona Exotic Animal Hospital.  Dr Wright and is staff are so kind, caring, helpful and knowledgable.  They saw me thru a difficult time with my parrot of over 20 years who had cancer.  I have 3 other parrots who are patients of Dr. Wright and he helps me keep them healthy and happy.

Arizona Exotic Bird Rescue, Inc  is dedicated to the rescue, rehabilitation, rehoming, and retirement of exotic birds.  Not  much is said about the plight of abused and/or homeless  parrots, cockatoos and a variety pack of other birds.  The lucky ones in up under the care of Jan at Arizona Exotic Bird Rescue, Inc.  Birds can be fun, lovable entertaining pets.   I know, I have three.  They are also high maintenance, needing far more attention to thrive than the average person  realizes, incredibly destructive and noisy.  When the novelty of a bird wears off, or owners realize their bird is not going to talk, merely squawk, or an owner no longer wishes to accessorize their home or office with a bird, the AZ Bird Rescue comes to well, the rescue.  Birds also end up at the the Bird Rescue when owners due to death or illness are no longer able to care for them.  Jan also offers volunteer opportunities, adoptions, fostering, bird grooming and boarding and would welcome your donations.

Justin and his crew are the go to guys if you need a repair and/or a windshield replacement. I had a rather unusual break in my moterhome's front window.  Justin and his guys were on it in a heartbeat, taking care of hunting down the correct product, worked with my insurance company and promptly replaced it. Auto Glass Buddy actually made having a broken window a pleasant experience. Don't bother with anyone else in the Phoenix area.  They will not disappoint.  Justin also does detailing. I had both of our trucks done and they came back showroom ready.
