Great food great service.   Sizzling rice soup is THE Bomb!    Potstickers are top notch.  And they will change anything anyway you want it.  So win win.

These folks have been my tailor in AZ for 20 years at both locations.    Solid advice, bar none the best deal in town for custom suits and tailoring.      Beautiful hand stitched bespoke suits, shirts etc made exactly the way they do in Italy, Britain etc.    Service is friendly and fast.    Absolutely the GO-to tailors in Phoenix AZ whether ou need cuffs on trousers or suspender buttons or a complete new look and the handmade suits to match.    Thousands of fabrics from modest to the finest on the earth.  My highest recommendation!

My friend and I went there on Monday night, had an amazing meal.  It was one of the best filet mignon either of us have ever tasted.  The artichoke appetizer was fantastic, best choke I've ever had.  Waitress was very good as well.    It was so good that the very next night (last night - Tuesday) we decided to go back.    We arrived at 915-930pm.  We were promptly seated. And we knew very quickly what we wanted to eat.  Prime rib and ahi, Caesar salads, and an artichoke app.  Ordered it.  Got a couple beers.   Then very quickly we got our artichoke.  Next we got our salads about two minutes later, and about two minutes after that we got our entrees.  We'd literally taken maybe two bites of salad and the waitress brings the entrees.    Talk about rushed!  It only gets worse.  About four minutes later the waitress comes by and takes my friend's beer glass.  He said " can I have another one?"  She said, "we're not serving anymore alcohol."  And I forgot to mention that the waitress had a generally bad attitude and snooty demeanor.  She was very obviously annoyed by a late table.  Very obviously annoyed.  No apology about the rush or no more beer just a snotty attitude.  She didn't even ask if we wanted dessert.  She was just thrilled to see us leave.    Call me crazy but in my 25 years working and managing a multitude of restaurants in every food genre and class NEVER, unless it was 2am and illegal did anyone not get offered another drink.  NEVER did I treat a customer so poorly, and NEVER did I allow my staff to do so either.    Maybe we need to put training wheels on the conversation for their staff.  Anyone heard of profit and loss?  EPIC FAILURE!    You lost customers.  You lost profit.  I vote with my wallet.  And my friend that took me out both nights makes more sitting on his couch than the staff put together.  It would be laughable to be treated like crap by crappy staff if it wasn't such a phenomenal example of how NOT to do customer service.    You lost big money; big Scottsdale money.    Call me crazy

Favorite new lunch spot.  Unassuming, low key.  Polite and friendly service.    The food is an outrageously good buy.    If there's a better bakery in AZ I haven't found it.   The baguette is second to none!    I've been here several times now and every time I am surprised how wonderful it is.    It opens early as any good bakery should.  And they have delicious coffee not to mention the pastries.   Salads are perfectly dressed and appointed.    I can't say enough about it.  I want to spread the word about how fantastic they are but also want to save them for myself.

Wow!  Just wow!  Totally and utterly overrated.  I really wanted to believe the hype and hysteria.  I really did.   My best friend and I went there last week.  The menu was melon soup with lime sorbet, heirloom tomato and cheese salad, and either ribeye or curried fish.    First the atmosphere is fantastic, really quaint and romantic. The servers were well meaning too.    First course: the amuse Bouche soup. It was about two table spoons of melon smoothie that anyone with a Vitamix can make.  Oh but it had a dollop of lime sorbet on top and a colorful swirl of who cares.  It was like getting dessert as appetizer but much less satisfying.  Second course: the heirloom tomato and super sprout phenomenon salad.   It had three  one quarter inch thick half moon slices of tomatos, three pieces of cheese and three quarters of a pound of sprouts of some Ã¼ber micro green.  But to be fair it did have a shmear of some paste on the plate.  Basically tasteless, tomatoes were less than ripe and still very hard.   Really 55.00 for three slices of tomatoe, cheese and a handful of greens? Call me crazy but the value for a a foodie for food that tastes like my kindergartner made it is just not there.  Fail number two.    Third course entree:  I had the "ribeye" and my friend had the curried fish.  The ribeye was unlike any ribeye I've had.  It frankly wasn't ribeye.  It was three medallions of lean beef over black lentils and drizzled with who cares wine reduction.  Again very lacking on flavor, contrast, and flavor.  But seriously folks who doesn't love a bite of top round with a deliciously bland mouthful of lentils to deaden all your taste buds?  Oh and before I forget, after we ordered my friend noted to me they didn't ask how you wanted your steak cooked.  So the next time the server came 'round we asked why and said I want it rare.  The server (who I think is in training bc he seemed to have to ask the other server everything - which is fine better sad than sorry there's a sometimes steep learning curve in fine dining) said, "the steak is cooked medium rare the way the chef wants it."  Now I haven't worked with Gordon Ramsey but I bet you a million dollars that he'd ask the patron for his opinion on the matter.  That said I still really think he was in training and forgot to ask and didn't want to go back to the kitchen and get yelled at for not asking etc.  Been there myself.  Fine medium rare will do just fine - the chef said so.    My friend's curried fish (I totally forgot what type of fish but I think it was mahi mahi) was the best dish of the night.  But it too was not that impressive.   I think I would rather hit malees for fish in curry sauce.  And again it had some lentil bland mound under the fish.    The final course was dessert.  We ordered two Lagavulin 16s on the rocks (it took a minute because the server had to ask the lead server to talk to is about scotch options) to go with the...oh wait the dessert was so unmemorable I forgot what it was.  I literally can't remember what it was.  But I do remember being unimpressed and saying to my friend the first course soup would've been a better dessert.    Lastly the bill.  The night before we ate at Mastro's In Scottsdale and had  a much much better bill to food ratio.  And I am a ravenous foodie and I understand small courses and I Know it's not a steak house.  My point here is that at the most expensive steakhouse in Scottsdale where the ribeye is 70 dollars or so and you know you are being plundered for meat you could buy at AJs and grill or put in your salamander you are still getting tastier food and more bang for your buck.  Or likewise if you went to Binkleys in cave creek your money would be So much better spent.  Food doesn't get masked and duct taped with lentils there.  And you could do 3 or 5 or 7 courses or just order off the menu AND Chef Binkley will take the time to ask if there is any special accommodations for allergies, taste profiles etc that he needs to change or modify for you.  Oh and it tastes amazing so you get your money's worth.  At cafe monarch (where the chef is king) they must be doing summer budget cuts and dialing the food down a notch as the snow birds leave and the locals get the table scraps, or maybe it was an off night, or maybe they just serve food that way I don't know but frankly it sucked.  TOTALLY AND UTTERLY OVERRATED AND UNIMPRESSIVE!   Oh and the ice cubes for our scotch cost $2.00 each.  That's right two dollars for frozen water put into a rocks glass.  Seriously, the budget must be really out of balance.

Food is authentic and delicious.    Service leaves something to be desired.   Slow and well slow - not staffed enough.    But if you want authentic Cambodian - it's worth the waiting for refills and check.  And the place fills up quick at lunch - so you may wait a bit on a table, which speaks to the quality of the food.  Definitely going back.

Best Buns in town.  I'm a burger fanatic and connoisseur - they get it right.    I usually get the turkey burger (bc it has a ridiculously delightful pear compote and bacon - salt/sweet combo) but I sub the patty with a beef patty because I'm a man.    Service is super cool, very friendly and per Arcadia standards good looking - just like me:)   Bicycle, and pet friendly too.    I'm a teetotaler so I can't speak to the beer  - but the people around me there really speak highly of it.    Also, the brunch is an unleashed mastodon of delights - worth the money and the crowd.

Hands Down best BBQ in Phoenix - get there early the line is real, and they often sell out of products.     Service and Staff attitude are fantastic!    A trio of sauces for all bbq palettes.    There's another highly rated BBQ place closer to my work but I'll drive and do the line for a fix of this.    I'm like a junkie now after two weeks.

Best French toast in town period.  I've tried everything on the menu and my whole family loves it.  The vegan hash is out of this world, and so is the vegan French toast.  My wife being vegan everywhere we go I get to try the vegan option and they're excellent at scramble.    Also their egg cook must have been hatched himself; he cooks basted eggs like Elvis ruled rock n roll.   My kids just love the Brizzas.  What kid doesn't like pizza? It's like the best of both worlds pizza and breakfast - get outta here awesome.   Also their servers and cashiers are always quick and helpful.  I've never had less than excellent service in my 30 plus times going to scramble (at either location for that matter).    For all the snobby A-holes in Scottsdale that want to have their hand held and want to piss and moan about ingredients I don't know how Scramble isn't at the top,of their list.  Everything is fresh and Local.  Their eggs come from the farm same or next day.    I tried butterfields and butters and us egg and I just don't like them nearly as well.  Not as fresh, not as hip, not as nice of people.    Hands down the breakfast spot in Scottsdale for anyone that likes casual, delicious, dog friendly, courteous, fresh, and local it's Scramble.  Do your research you won't find fresher ingredients or nicer folks.    Oh and The patio is perfect for Scottsdale.    I've worked in restaurants and restaurant management for over 20 years and these guys are doing it right, paying it forward and it's paying off.    And if you are one of the people that doesn't like it - good go to Denny's enjoy a grand slam =/

Went back this morning with the family and just had to say how good it was.  My wife got the Vegan burrito even as a meat lover I must say, it was really good.  I had the Huevos Ranchero and the kids of course got the Brizza's.     The egg whisperer was at it again.  The basted eggs are the Best I've eaten.   Of course even having stuffed myself with the whole families left-overs I can't leave scramble without eating their french toast.  It is my favorite french toast anywhere.  When I'm in Scottsdale I have to eat it.   My wife feels the same about the sweet potato hash.     The kids were as happy as - well- as happy as kids eating pizza!    Oh and almost forgot but we brought our dog too - and guess what?  They cater to people with dogs.  Dog bowls and everything.  Awesome.    Service as usual was very hop-to-it helpful, happy, smiling, fast and pleasant to the eye.   Scramble is perfect for morning to lunch business and family outings with the dog - What more do you want?    Again it's my number one breakfast recommendation in AZ period.

Roman is the best barber I've had in Phoenix.    I'm retired Army and have had a LOT of haircuts everywhere.  (For the record the best places in the world are little shops right by FT Bragg NC owned and run by little Asian ladies).  I like a good razor fade.  And currently have what some -those that wish to die in so saying - would call a hipster haircut.    Since I retired a year ago I've been to probably twenty barbers in Phoenix.   No one compares to this shop.    Best shop, service, products and above all haircuts.    Flawless fade with no edges, flares or variation in line.    This is my barber shop.

Fantastic!  First I am a mallow lover.  I've had "gourmet" marshmallows at every opportunity.  I've made them at home several times as well.  Even considered having a fun side business doing what these folks do.    But I don't think I'd ever come close.  My daughters and I stopped by yesterday having driven curiously by several times before.  We bought a selection of 5 flavored marshmallows.  No fixings on them really.  Mint/chocolate, churro, strawberry, lemon, and coconut. I'm a purest so I don't really like s'mores I think the chocolate and graham take away from the flavor of a stand alone beauty - the roasted marshmallow. (Sure chocolate and grams are good but I'd rather eat them in their purity as well).   All this to say - we roasted them today with friends and family and they were absolutely stellar.  So soft and pillowy (I mean remarkably soft and wonderful to the touch - shoe companies should take a lesson here if I could walk on a substance like this is never sit down) .  Melted into ooh-ey gooey perfection.    Hands down best marshmallows I've ever eaten.  The flavors stood up well.  (Many flavored mallows smell like the flavor but don't taste like it after roasting).    The kids were a mess.  My beard was a mess.  Sticky decadent delightful messy wonder that is marshmallows.    Definitely highly recommended - will return.   The one and only downside is the price. They're expensive - 6.00 for 4 flavored mallows.  But like a Rolex or a fine car or a handmade anything you get what you pay for - it's about what you value in life.  Personal, handmade, exquisite quality or humdrum.    I'll take the Rolex of marshmallows please.

Can't think of a better lunch spot in Phoenix.  I've had everything on the menu and often get whatever special they have for the day.    The burger is a miracle.  The cordon blue is fantastic.    Honestly I can't think of anything in the menu that isn't a knockout - it's all just perfectly done.  Breads for sandwiches are better than Hillstone or OSHO etc.    Jody the bartender is hands down the best bartender/server in town.  Just an absolute delight.  Fantastic memory - has my drink on the bar before I'm done putting my jacket on the chair.  A true sweetheart.  Makes you feel like Norm from Cheers every time you walk in.   This is my NUMBER ONE SPOT for lunch around the Biltmore business district.    Chef is righteous and his menu is as friendly as it gets.   I can't say enough good about the place.    Oh FANTASTIC prices - best bang for your buck period!!!
