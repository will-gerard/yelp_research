Wow....my friends and I went here last night after checking out the Yelp reviews. We normally go to Sushi Brokers or Kabuki, but their regular happy hours had ended for the night. We decided to give Sake Bombers a try since it's right down the street and their happy hour goes until 7 pm. We were extremely disappointed. The only roll we ended up finishing was the Boston roll, which was pretty good. The Crispy California and Tootsie were okay, but nothing great. The eel sauce was a little thick. The Salmon Dynamite roll is also just okay, but the spicy mayo here is HORRIBLE! My friend got a side of it and it seriously looked like someone just squeezed some Miracle Whip out of a tube and added some other flavors/colors to it. It was thick and chunky, and quite frankly disgusting. Do not order the Playgirl -- the fish on top was not fresh, and the ginger soy sauce was overwhelming. We barely touched this roll.   The happy hour was also not very great -- they didn't even have something simple like a spicy tuna on happy hour. Who wants to pay $7.50 for a basic roll that's normally on happy hour for around $4 at other places? I had a stomach ache for about two hours after eating here...I'm thankful I didn't get sick, but this was honestly the worst sushi experience I've ever had.   It's also kind of ironic that the food at this place was so poor, when the sushi chefs and most of the workers were actually Asian. We will not be returning here ever again.

Cider Mill is no more ): Tried to go here today with some friends to check it out after seeing all these great reviews and was told they're now under new management and called EAT West of Brown. We stayed and ordered food to be polite and the food was decent, but with no homemade cider or handcrafted sodas to offer there's nothing here to make it stand out from other restaurants. I'm SO bummed we didn't get to try this place before. They even started taking the sign down while we were there and it was pretty depressing.

My coworkers and I just went here today for lunch. We work on E. Avenue of the Fountains so it was super close.   We went at noon and the place was empty. It was sort of a bad sign, especially given the previous reviews, but we've been meaning to try this place out for a while. The waiter was very nice and attentive. The water is pretty gross tap water but the food was really great. It definitely exceeded my expectations.   They have really good deals - Two of us did the buy 2 regular rolls for $9, which is a great price. The Vegas roll is even listed as a regular roll, instead of a specialty, which is great. Our other coworker did the lunch teriyaki chicken bowl which was $7, also a decent price.   I got the Vegas roll and the spicy tuna and both were amazing. My friend got a regular salmon roll and an eel roll, which both tasted fresh and delicious. We also ordered eggrolls to start, which had good flavor but were steaming hot (which is good - they were obviously fresh) but they were quite oily and when you bit into them the piping hot oil keep coming out of the bottom and burning my hand. I probably wouldn't order those again, but the sushi was amazing.   Their list of specialty rolls (about 2 double-sided pages!) looked great - I'll definitely have to try one of those next time.  Overall, service was great (but if they do get busy I'm sure it would go down if they still only had one server). The water isn't great and the egg rolls were rather oily but the sushi is worth going for! Prices aren't bad at all for good-quality sushi. You don't even have to wait for a happy hour since these deals are available all day. We will definitely be returning!

I absolutely love this place! I've been there several times and tried many beers, as they're always rotating. Everything is great (the Chili Milk Stout and the Strawberry Rhubarb have been my favorites). The food is also delicious; they recently changed their menu to include more than pizza. It can be a little pricy, but it's a great date spot.

Come here for the boba! My boyfriend and I stumbled across this place and we're hooked! Their thai tea is great, I've had the almond smoothie and coconut smoothie which were both delicious, and their flavored teas are also amazing. I really need to try the house special!

This place is excellent! The bf and I went there last week on a Wednesday, so it wasn't very crowded. Nice hip vibe with cool local artwork on the walls. I like the bar with the neon changing lights. But it's not too hipster -- it's approachable, and there were plenty of average people there like myself. Service was great.  We ordered the eggplant dip that came with pita bread (so good) and veggies. It was super fresh and we devoured it. We also ordered the Popeye pizza -- again, very fresh ingredients. I had the Blue Biggie Mac. It came out in its own little silver dish with handles which was adorable. We boxed up our leftovers for lunch the next day and ordered dessert: peach bread pudding with a salted caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream. Oh my, was it delectable. We will certainly be returning!! The prices are decent considering the quality of the ingredients. I really want to try one of their cocktails next time.

This place is fantastic! So glad I found it on Yelp! Went there on Saturday and it was busy but there were a few tables open. The bf and I both got the nutella strawberry banana crepe, but he got his with ice cream (decadent!) The crepes are just what they need to be -- soft but a little crunchy on the edges. The serving size was perfect. I just wish they would add a couple more flavors to their menu! I definitely want to try the peach one next.   I ordered a hazelnut ice blended coffee and he got the white chocolate ice blended. Both drinks were great -- they were a little runny, but it's summer in AZ so that's to be expected, but the flavor was spot-on. Sweet but you could still taste the rich coffee flavor.   The service was also very good. It was mainly staffed by high school-aged kids, but they were very friendly and the girl behind the counter gave us an extra stamp on our punch card for being new customers.  Thanks, Colados! We will be back!!

This is a very unique place for a specific demographic: gamers. It's so refreshing to see this, in contrast to the countless sports bars and other watering holes on Mill Ave. I don't particularly like Mill Ave, but friends told us about this place and we had to check it out.   It's located upstairs near the ASU Brickyard, between 6th and 7th St, in a nice hideaway spot. Their website right now is lacking, but hopefully they'll be updating it. The space is fairly large, with quite a few booths and tables strewn throughout. A decent selection of beers and ciders on tap and some specialty drinks that I saw.   Do not come here specifically for the food. This isn't the place to get a decent dinner; the food is basically just late-night bar food that you crave after you've been drinking: mozzarella sticks, french fries, some questionable-looking pizza, etc. The portions are all pretty small compared to the price too. Drink prices are totally reasonable, but just skip on the food unless you're starving.   Now let's get to the point: It's a video game bar. There are about two of each system lining the wall that are attached to decent-sized computer monitors. It looks like they have pretty much every gaming system, so there's something for everyone. There are leather couches in one area with big screen tvs with the newer platforms hooked up. People were playing Halo and Mario Kart and the like. There's also another area with Rock Band set up, which was fun.   Everyone was super nice and the place really exceeded my expectations. There was no cover, no fee to play any of the games, and it was great. I'm sure this will change in the future when they gain popularity, but for now, it's a really affordable place and very welcoming. We checked out a couple games with the guy at the service desk, and they have quite the selection. Everything is inventoried on the computer, so you couldn't physically see the titles, but the games we asked for they had, and they gave us extra controllers too. Here's a list of the games per their website: http://endgamebar.com/games/  Overall, it was an awesome evening full of fun. Next time we're going to bring some board games and lounge in one of the booths also. We had no problems with our tab and the bartender we interacted with seemed really cool. He let me try one of the ciders before I committed to it, which I appreciated. If you're into video games at all, you will appreciate this place for its unique vibe and charm.
