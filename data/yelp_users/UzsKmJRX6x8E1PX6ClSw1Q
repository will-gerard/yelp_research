gonna skip the discussion of what the best nonprofits are. just want to address what it's like to be a big at this branch.  the interview is extensive, which is obviously important. i did it at a starbucks in tempe and told these people a lot of details about my life.  they work reaaaally hard to make a good fit with your kid. i was matched with the oldest of 3 boys who all got matches, and after getting to know all of them, they got everything exactly right. personalities just worked out well based on the profiles they made of us.  the match coordinators vary a good bit in their approach, but basically they call you every once in a while and check up on progress. they do the same with the little's parent/guardian. it's not that complicated on that end. my coordinator changed probably 4 times which was annoying, but not that big of a deal.  the thinkbig website that they use to show opportunities is pretty good. i used it a few times for tickets and museum stuff. they do a great job chasing down free fun stuff.  my experience with my little was incredible. everyone's experience will be unique on this front, of course. but if you're on the fence, please go for it.  thank you for reading & maybe volunteering. god bless

what a treat. i'm not gonna pretend to be a super discerning indian food critic but i love it here. the staff is kind of formal, place is usually quiet. never very crowded. got lamb korma, chicken karahi, a bunch of garlic naan & rice, and a couple kingfishers. i don't leave any bites of food in the bowls at this place - wish the portions were a little bigger.  sometimes i feel like indian is unnecessarily expensive but i think these guys really do go the extra mile on ingredients and presentation. got out of here for $27 or so and i feel that's reasonable. this is a go-to spot to eat comfort food with family. last night i brought a friend who had never had indian food and he's now officially on board, so that's a great sign.   if i came in with the intention of spending $100, i would leave really happy.  i have a little concern that they'll close down because there's not a ton of traffic through there and the space is enormous. we'll see i guess. i'll keep coming back regardless.

Thai food is pretty easy to do well. Unfortunately thai lahna cuts a lot of corners and serves mediocre food. It's a neat little space with cool decorations but it's nowhere near the best thai you can get in the area   Chicken satay was ok, but the peanut sauce was runny and gross. Chicken lahb (I normally see it called "larb") didn't have nearly enough citrus and I could feel granules of chili powder on my tongue. Green curry with beef was underwhelming in flavor and lacked any interesting tasty veggies  If a friend made this meal for me, I'd be like great job, keep working at it! Unfortunately this is a restaurant, so it gets 2 stars

this is the best phô spot i've been to in the valley. it's in a ratty little strip mall in a shitty part of town, but it's absolutely dirt-cheap and definitely made from scratch by a family who knows what they are doing.   my iced tea was kinda gross but the food is divine, and i absolutely stuffed my disgusting face for about $8.   go here if you're hungry and nearby, it's 1000% worth it

compound fractured my tibia & fibula in march and they ambulanced my butt over to osborn. not my favorite experience in life but i have basically zero negative things to say about the quality of care or the facility. food was really good, nurses were super attentive, they even made my mom kind of feel OK about the whole thing which is a damn miracle.  weird things: - i got a wheelchair and signed an agreement to rent it for a while. i wanted to return it so i called the place on my agreement, never got an answer. called them probably 10 more times. no answer. finally had a buddy of mine go to the listed address to drop it off and in the listed suite is now a sylvan learning center. goofy. - the ER doc, who saw me for maybe 30 minutes, is billing $4000 for "setting" my fracture (COME ON BRO!!!!!) - billing sucks. unsurprisingly they use a call center somewhere across the country. not the hospital's fault but people on the back end don't communicate with one another, so i've spent more than a few hours making sure everyone is doing their jobs. frustrating.  overall, a clean and nice hospital. i hope i never go back.

Can't give it 5 stars because I've had a couple poor service experiences here (of 100+ times dining), but PJ is one of my very favorite local restaurants. Can be crowded, at which point the level of service will go down...as with pretty much all awesome, affordable restaurants? Don't know why people would put "crowded" as such a downside. Other people want to eat here too. Call in your order, you goons.  Super casual atmosphere compared with a lot of Arcadia-area business lunch type places, but the food is absolutely top notch.  The quality of the meals here is almost unparalleled for the price. My favorites are mahi-mahi with pita chips, hummus trio with chicken, lentil fetoosh salad, and the lavosh shwarma wrap. I substitute veggies on some of these and they always get it right.  Also possibly the best iced tea in town. And they always give me a to-go cup.

Massive portions of the Greek version of comfort food. It doesn't get much better than Z's for the price and convenience. Great staff, quick service, diner feel. I have had probably 80% of the menu and can't say any of them has been subpar.   I'm here 2x a week for lunch, and my go-to meal is a falafel appetizer and a Greek salad with chicken.

Cartel has really good coffee and tea, super loud music, lots of thigh tattoos, and a slow, overpopulated wifi network. In-your-face progressive, with bicycle wheels and local art. I find it charming & welcoming. Plenty of places to sit, not all of them are comfortable. I recommend it as a gateway to west Tempe.

this review is all about the sunday buffet. in the course of writing this review i'm certain that i will convince myself to go tomorrow.  zam zam is family run, and it's completely wonderful. they only do buffet on sundays so as not to have to serve, you know, buffet food. i think it's $16 but that represents a clear economic win for anyone who eats even one plate.  the dining area of the restaurant is dated and a little shabby, but it feels like home. a few other reviewers have mentioned what a family atmosphere you feel here - i'm with you. great vibes.   the food is just killer. i've seen my brother eat 10 pieces of their grilled chicken tikka. my mouth is watering as i'm typing this sentence. beef nihari on point. fresh hot naan until you canaan't. i can't believe you get to eat as much as you want at this place!!! what a time to be alive  4 stars since i can only go on sundays because i'm spoiled by the buffet portions  robbo

this is an excellent business. steve, the owner, went to bat for me in the confusing battle of insurance adjusting and body work so that i didn't have to deal with my insurance company (big surprise - they're obnoxious). he stayed in touch via text (that's huge, bro) and delivered my car back to my workplace in great shape. AND he charged me less than my full deductible. AAAAND he fixed a dent that he didn't have to. the people's champion.   4 stars instead of 5 because: 1) the actual shop work isn't done on site at the acoma location, which is kind of weird and i didn't know until later 2) steve drives a really expensive car, like a ferrari or something? it's way too nice. i don't want my car repair guy to be loaded. sorry steve - symbols matter  overall, a great experience, highly recommended, you're the man steve  god bless  robbo

I haven't had any work done here that was less than excellent. Fair prices, fast, and super friendly. A local business I am happy to support.

revo is good and i laik it. fresh menu with a ton of options. FYI "fresh" doesn't mean "fast". those are, to some extent, mutually exclusive. this is not chipotle - things are getting cooked in real time.  customer service is excellent, they've never gotten my order wrong. i believe they're expanding which should be cool.  the only thing i don't recommend is the green chile burrito. it's just too wet - makes it hard to eat. other than that almost everything has been stellar. good sides, great tacos. thumbs up

Never as good as I want it to be. A façade of a boutique local goodness. Eating here is like watching reality television, in that it's very bad and we should all stop doing it  Consistently average food in a cool location with OK service. The only redeeming things about Ncounter (Jesus I hate the name even more now that I type it) are that I can crawl there from my condo and the coffee is self-serve.  The food I regrettably find myself coming back here for is the killer, a breakfast sandwich on ciabatta which is about 60% gorgonzola cheese and the rest dark personal shame and bacon.  In short, if you are trying to wake up tomorrow and do a little bit better than you did today, please skip Ncounter. This review was mostly to talk myself out of ever coming back here. Thank you for reading, God bless

Charming joint in a sleazy strip mall where you underpay to be overfed. Authentic, welcoming, spicy. I love it.  As Alex S. said below, some of the items have too much rice. I don't really recommend the pulao dishes for that reason, though the lamb shank is delicious, and yes, I finished the rice. Get something spicy & soupy with naan. Anything karahi or nihari.

HYU rules. prices are great, people are friendly, teachers are cool, and the porous floor in the studio room keeps it from smelling awful.  i think there miiiight be some fluctuations in the heating systems, as i have felt a little cold in certain spots in the big room. can be crowded in the early afternoon and on weekends, so get there 15 minutes early.   knock on wood, i've never really had a negative experience here and i don't expect you to either   :) namaste

grabbagreen is a little silly. i appreciate the premise and i like to support places that give it their best to serve healthy food, but this is just a little off.  juices are $7+; that's a travesty. there is not 12oz of juice in existence worth $7. "juice cleanses" are not a real thing - please google it. do not buy juice here.  the food boxes are pretty decent. they definitely do exactly what they say they will do: toss a bunch of fresh and healthy ingredients together in a bowl. i appreciate that they do brown rice and quinoa and udon noodles, and a nice mix of veggie and protein options. kudos for having those options.  unfortunately almost all of the dishes are super bland. sorry guys!!! i still like you. it's just not a great meal for like $11.   i will keep trying to see if things gets better. but for now.........skip it  god bless  robbo

robert is good people. i needed help in a pinch, read a couple good reviews, and he was over in a jiffy. drives a big ass truck. clearly knowledgeable about car repair and he gets customer service. i really dig it when people can interact via text message for service oriented stuff. prices are super reasonable - he spent about 25 minutes on my car and i think the total was $27. already recommended him to friends and will continue to do so. thanks again for the help robert.  cheers m8

underwhelming. actually worse than that. i'm actively opposed to coming back  the parking situation is BS, just BS. fix it.  the new layout is fine. they built it like a sports bar. you know how in certain stupid restaurants you KNOW you pay a premium for the food so that you can sit in a taller leather booth and have like 3 46" LED TVs within view? this place is the perfect example of that  it took 50 minutes to get our food from the time we ordered it. that number is precise. we got, you know, chicken and waffles. our waitress was sweet and polite but messed up the drink orders, and then again by telling us our order was "next in line" after half an hour. don't do that.  the waffles are thin! the chicken is whatever!!!! that's really all there is to it. whoever is in charge of this place put ALL the effort into the "ambiance" (listen up team, we really gotta hone in on that dave and busters vibe), shitty punny t-shirts for the staff, and the instagram feed.   i have such an icky feeling about it in retrospect. just like a sticky, gross, awful hangover vibe for $17. skip this place. it's a mess.
