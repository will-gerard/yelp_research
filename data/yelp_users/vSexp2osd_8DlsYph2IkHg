Great fun. Enjoy the live blues bands that come through. There is even dancing which is fun. Small intimate feel.

Really enjoyed this quaint little wine bar. Ambiance and decor were great, however it was dark so difficult to read the menu. The Waitress helped me pick out a good glass of red wine, although she liked more rose wines. The bruschetta was AMAZING!!! We tried a variety of the bruschetta: apple & bri, artichoke and prosciutto. Can't wait to go back!

SLOW SERVICE for larger parties. No reservations so we had 4 people go an hr early to check in, when our whole party got there they told us they'd start saving tables!!! They didn't tell us the hour before!! Had to wait ANOTHER hour to finally be seated and our group was split up. We weren't able to eat together.  Only like 6 tables inside. Otherwise you will be eating outside.

Owner is very nice. Great atmosphere with plenty tables for studying or meetings. The kids working are a part of an outreach program to give high school kids work experience. I love coming here to support the cause. Just be patient as the kids are learning.

Love supporting this place! It's a locally run Christian coffee Shop that is all about supporting local community and inner city kids. They hire and teach high schoolers, preparing them for the next step. That alone brings me here!  The workers are very friendly, helpful and upbeat. Great customer service. The environment is family friendly (I always see families or groups studying here).  Their drinks are too sweet for me (I like my coffee dark and strong, no sugar). But they have some great creative flavor combinations. They also have fro-yo and just started implementing a weekend omelette station!

I love this place however they have cut down on portions significantly! I typically get a chicken walnut sand which which is just filling enough for lunch. Now it's like the size of a half sandwich! 2 bites and you are down! Not worth the $8 sandwich if you ask me.
