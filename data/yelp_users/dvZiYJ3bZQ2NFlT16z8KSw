This is a dusty (literally) little cafe. The pork and vegetable potstickers were yummy but served cold. The ramen with bbq pork was good but order it with "more pork" if you want more than 2 pieces of meat. The vegetable and tofu tempura was delicious in a broth. Service was not very good, they didn't come check on us or anything. I'd eat here again.

I was excited to try this place since I often drive by. I was very disappointed. The beer battered zucchini rings were over salted. The meatball sub was over priced ($9) and lackluster. It was unsatisfying and lacked flavor. The Italian beef sandwich had good beef but was very dry. I will not return.

We stopped here late one Monday night. This place is very decorative inside. The host suggested the specials and even gave us a sample of Chow fung. It was delicious so we ordered it. The food just kept coming! For $14 you get a dinner special of an entree, egg roll, crab Rangoon, soup, and honey chicken! They were very friendly. They gave us fresh coconut macaroons for dessert as well! I have found my new favorite Chinese restaurant in Phoenix. The food was fresh and delicious!

This used to be Bobby Magee's (spelling?) and we used to come here as kids! Same owner, different concept. They cure their meats in house and have an open fire pit to Smoke meats.   Very friendly staff who brought out my nieces food right away (she has diabetes so this is very important!). Great atmosphere for kids since it gets a bit loud. Food was delicious, especially pulled pork sandwich. Love the corn, the Mac and cheese is very cheesy, so be careful. Love their cornbread! I'll definitely come back.

There were only 2 salespeople working the Women's Shoe department on a busy Sunday afternoon. Since no one can try on shoes unless a salesperson gives them the sizes they want, this took forever to get any service and try on any shoes. After waiting for so long, and they didn't have my shoe size, I just left. Great selection, if only one could get some to try on!

The staff was snobby. It was difficult to locate a menu. They acted like I was inconveniencing them by ordering there. There are no outlets, so not good for studying. They brought me a sandwich, even though I ordered a pizza. Then they brought my pizza, which was mediocre.

While their drinks are over-priced ($5 a drink), this place makes for a great time. I wanted to take my friends to have a gay ol' time. We went to see the Barbra Seville show on a Saturday night. This was NOT disappointing. For just a $3 cover we got to see incredibly talented drag queens. The show goes on for around 2 hours and is packed with quality entertainment. I had no idea Phoenix was such a hotbed of talented drag stars! Barbra Seville herself is not only a great drag queen, but a riotous comedian. Bring lots of dollar bills to hand to the queens as they come through the crowd! Also, reserve a table ahead of time because there was standing room only. Great for parties and celebrating.  They also have karaoke and darts. There's a lot going on in this small bar, but it's really fun and filled with the nicest bartenders and entertainers you'll meet. I'll definitely be back for another fun Saturday night.   Whether you are gay or straight, you'll have a great time at the Rock.

We were in need of pest control for cockroaches at our condo. I called a few places and left messages, Alpha Pest Control was the first to call me back. While other pest control places claimed it would take a few treatments to get rid of the roaches, Alpha said it would only take one. I was skeptical but they guaranteed that one treatment would do the trick. Since they are only open until 5 p.m., we had them come on our lunch hour. They were EXACTLY on time! They did a thorough job for $150 and after the initial dead roaches lying around we haven't seen any more! What a relief, I highly recommend Alpha.

Friendly staff, light ambiance music but it isn't so overwhelming that you can't concentrate. Outlets everywhere! Great for studying. Yummy cookies.

I was looking for a place to take my parents while they were in town. Let's just say this wasn't one of my finer selections. I called ahead to see if they took reservations since it was noon on a Sunday. They just said "we close at 2." Ok..... My parents called for directions and were told "I don't know, I only know how to get here from my house."   It's a novelty that the movie "Alice" was filmed here and the outside was used in stills for the tv show, but other than that there's no reason to attract visitors. The service was not very good, it took awhile for a waitress to take our order. We waited 45 minutes for our food (nothing too complex, eggs, French toast, a salad). I will say the waitress did a great job with quality control because she sent one order of eggs back before it came to us since it wasn't cooked over easy as we'd ordered. Food was mediocre. The potatoes and eggs were dry.   We won't be back. They get 1 star for being featured in "Alice" and one star for serving us edible food.

We went here for a nice night out. The service was a bit slow. It was ok food but it made us a bit sick. We had the chicken with romaine hearts and t bone steak. Broccoli was good though.

Great local shop. I had the bacon cheddar burger which was delicious. Staff were super friendly and brought the food out. Great prices, lots of thick cut fries with the burger. They took credit cards and our orders were prepared in good time even though they are were busy.

Located in an old Quiznos, this is great food for a great value! Very low prices, everything was fried and delicious. Try the spicy catfish in strips or nuggets with sides of sweet potato tots, fried okra and jalapeño hush puppies. We waited 20 minutes for our food, but it was worth the wait. The lemonade is delicious! The decor leaves much to be desired.

Vietnamese tea was delicious with soymilk. Generous portions. Good pho but lots of green onion. Pho was even better after being refrigerated and heated up the next day!

I really wanted to like this place. It's in a cute house and I'm sure usually it's great. But I got their garlic and tomato soup of the day and it tasted like water. No hint of garlic at all. I essentially paid $6 for a bowl of water.

We stumbled upon this place on Indian School. There was no wait, service was fast and great. The gyro sandwich was delicious and fresh. It is a little hole in the wall place, with middle eastern decor but also tropical beaded curtains and pictures of black and white pin-up girls. Definitely recommend.

I was going to Shine Coffee around lunch time and was pleasantly surprised that Short Leash had their food truck there. The staff were very friendly, down to earth and patient. I ordered a veggie dog with green chilies and pinto beans but they have a great unique assortment of hot dogs and fixings. The hot dog was wrapped in a sort of pita bread. It was delicious. The service and the experience was great. I highly recommend them!

This is a cute authentic restaurant. The spring rolls were delicious and whetted our appetites. We ordered the grilled pork dish which was DIVINE. The chicken curry was also good. I'd recommend this place to anyone.

I came here to find Waldo, as they are participating in the local Where's Waldo hunt through Changing Hands bookstore. Staff were very nice and friendly. This is a really cute place. Their cookies are delicious! Ice cream is fabulous! Love the old school vibe.

We bought a groupon to this theater. The movie was great ("Gone Girl"). The seating is like a lecture hall with nice business chairs. The food was mediocre. The chicken nachos were like a salad, the burgers were sugary and the fries tasted like they'd been sprinkled with cinnamon, sugar, and salt. Very odd.

This place is amazing. They are a super cute little shop. The woman who works there was super friendly. She let me sample the toddy before I purchased one. She brought my drink out to me at my table. They have a nice indoor lounge where you can work and use wi-fi. They have great accommodations but the best thing is the lady who works there. She is just so nice she really brightened my day. For an unpretentious coffee and lounge experience, definitely go to Shine!

Their burgers are messy and delicious! The PBJ and Bacon burger is unique, but the flavors really compliment each other. Be prepared for that burger to get all over the place. Same with the Mac and cheese burger, delicious and messy. The hatch chile burger was just the right level of spicy! Sweet potato tots are delicious as well. Large portions, delicious burgers! Note that burgers ordered medium were still pretty pink inside.

We were very satisfied with our food. My dad hates cheese and was happy that they don't put cheese on anything automatically. The burger was great and they split it on two plates so we could share. Nice ambiance and mood lighting. I wouldn't say it is 2 $, I would say it is 3 $. Most dishes over $15.

Why don't I come here every week?! Delicious food! The staff are very friendly and the place is cute. Most importantly, the food concept is great. I ordered a #10, turkey with cheese, apples, and mustard. The flavors are complex but Mix together in a perfect arrangement. They do a neat thing with their bread, toasting it together like a pita. My boyfriend had the #35, roast beef, cheddar, horseradish. It tasted like prime rib! The sandwiches came with sides, we ordered kale salad with mandarin oranges and potato salad. Again, many ingredients that come together in perfect harmonious flavors. The portions seem small but they are perfect and fill you up.

Wow. Philly cheese steak was serene. Pepper poppers were perfect. Great prices, good portion sizes. Marinara spaghetti and salad was also good. Delivery took 50 minutes on a Friday night, they were very nice.

Delicious local ice creamery! They are so cute, they give you ice cream in Chinese takeout boxes with a fortune cookie. I had horchata flavored ice cream, highly recommended! The chocolate, maple fudge flavors are also tasty. Worth a stop when you're downtown!

I have eaten here twice now. I get cravings for their delicious cause rellena, which is a stack of creamy potato purée, chicken salad, avocado, and egg with creamy mustardy sauce. Their lomo Saltado is sure to please with perfect strips of beef in a delicious mildly spicy sauce, with a triangle mound of white rice and French fried potatoes. I highly recommend this locally owned restaurant!

The meat in the carne asada tacos and pork in the burrito was really good. My friends said it was the best street style tacos and burrito they'd ever had. The bean burro was just ok. Simple atmosphere with Loteria cards on the walls. The service was ok.

I wish I could eat here everyday! My coworker and I decided to try this little restaurant beat our office. We were not disappointed! I ordered the curry chicken, which fell right off the bone and was delicious with potatoes in the curry. I also had the "rice and peas" which is rice with some beans in there, also delicious. We had sides of plantains, perfectly cooked. They have other dishes I'd love to try, such as deep fried cornbread, jerk chicken, and a selection of Jamaican beers. We checked in on yelp and received 10% off. Definitely try this restaurant! They have a much more extensive menu than the picture of the menu that's here on yelp.

I have been excited to try Mother Bunch Brewing since I heard they were coming to the neighborhood. The owners are active in the community and I have seen them donate beer to different community events, such as the "Be AZ" event at Refugee Focus. I love how they have set up the space, with the bar in the middle of the  restaurant as you walk in. The lunch special is a great value. 10 oz of beer, choice of two items for $10. I ordered the Sonoran White Chocolate beer, arugula, pear and bleu cheese salad, and Beer Mac and Cheese. All were delicious! I do worry that they don't keep the beer at a cold enough temperature since I noticed that they get a lot of head/foam on it when it comes out of the tap. That can cost restaurants thousands of dollars in wasted beer throughout the year, so I hope they get that under control. Definitely worth a taste, there are lots of interesting foods to choose from!

Simple, claustrophobic and overpriced. The place looks very cheaply put together. Courses are very simple.The putting holes are just plywood sprayed with glow in the dark paint. It's a neat idea and place but the holes are really close together. It's pretty claustrophobic. But we got a hole in one at the last hole and got a free round of golf. It was hot in there too.

Delicious and fabulous food! What a great hidden find in central Phoenix. The owner described the food choices to us and allowed us to make a vegetable and meat platter. The chickpeas, lentils and potato are delicious vegetarian choices. The chicken was so tender, I couldn't believe how delicious it was. The owners are so nice and friendly. It's a very cute place to eat family style. Bring lots of people as portions are reasonable!
