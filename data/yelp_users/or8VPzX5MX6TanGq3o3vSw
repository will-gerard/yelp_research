Best dj ever for karaoke! ! 1 stars because their waitresses are rude!!! Jenny wouldn't serve me because I looked grumpy when I asked for a drink.

Granted they were busy but hostess ran into an elderly gentleman and almost knocked him over. If they are bust the food can take over a hour. I only stop here if there are a couple cars in the parking lot.

I like the food. Waited 30 mins when we were told 15. When I asked how much longer, the hostess  was pretty rude about it. Waitress did not get our drink orders right and they placed 5 adults at a 4 person table. It was a holiday and they were very busy, but I was pretty disappointed. Food was good and the price is inexpensive for a steak. Steak was cooked correctly, I ordered mine medium.

Beautiful Christmas lunch. The hostesses were not pleasant bit the waiters and servers for the brunch were excellent! ! So helpful and quick. The valet people were great too!  We ate indoors which was nice but the tables were too close to each other. Food was tasty! They had a nice variety, traditional turkey dinner, sushi, pasta, seafood, and a fantastic dessert bar!

We had a group of 14 people, 13 were seniors. They were fantastic. Great food and great service!! I had the curry goat and it was very tasty. It does come with bones so if you are not a bone in person or the coconut curry shrimp which was also very good!

I came here with my family for thanksgiving brunch. The staff was helpful and on top of their game. The food was great! They had breakfast food and the traditional turkey dinner. Decor is contemporary and they have a beautiful patio. They had a live jazz band playing on the patio.

Friendly and the food was delicious!  My mother is gluten/dairy free and I'm allergic to citrus. They were very accommodating!
