Went here on a Sunday afternoon when we were in this area. Disappointed that our visit wasn't better.  The service was ok, they were not rude but weren't really hospitable either. The food was horrible! I ordered the chicken strips and fries and both were cold and gross. Strips were really hard as well. My sons barely touched their fries as well and did not finish their food as it was just "OK" they said. The Oreo shake was the only good food item we received that day. The atmosphere of the diner as you would expect was overall cool and my boys loved the jukebox.   Overall the food was a big turn off, we will not be returning.

Really good family owned pizza shop. Stopped in after coming from the Splash Pad down the street with my kids. We ate there, the employees were extremely friendly and VERY hospitable. They kept checking on us to see if we needed anything and even engaged in some chit chat with my boys which they always have a million questions as most kids do and the one employee she stood there and carried on a conversion with them lol. That in my book is worth 5 stars alone so THANK YOU. The food was good as well.   Next time I'm in this area, we will be back for sure.

Really nice place to visit.  I came here with my two sons (7&5) and they loved it.  Feeding the fish was their favorite part and just walking around and taking in all the beauty is worth your time.  The employees that I came into contact with were so VERY hospitable and friendly which will make me come back again with my sons.   Take a moment and stop in here (plan and hour or so)you are missing out if you don't.

Really neat and cool discount theater.  Price is cheap and the movie memorabilia they have in their lobby makes it that much cooler lol.  My boys loved that and couldn't wait to see the different things and take a picture next to them.   Will be back for sure!

Great place! Food was very good, seemed like I blinked at the food was at our table lol. Our server Courtney was very hospitable and good, she was a Rockstar! Loved the store, and my boys had to stop and play a game of checkers on the way out.   Will be returning for sure!

This place is pretty awesome! I've been here a couple times now with my boys, and they have a blast! They have a little of everything from a lazy river you can ride around,to the big splash pad with the huge bucket dropping water on you. There is a food cart on the weekends (not sure if it's all week) with snacks and some food items such as pizza and hot dogs while they last (cash only). The place is cheap to get into as well, and overall just a fun place to beat the heat in the valley.   If you're looking for a great splash pad in the valley I'd say this is it!

Great place from my experiences.  I come here with my 2 boys and they love the doughnuts, I tried the breakfast burrito and it was pretty good. Their drinks are good as well.  What takes it over the top is their hospitality and friendliness, very great indeed!! I will be coming back most definitely!

Cool place, my first time here. I stopped in around 2 for a late lunch figuring I would just miss the lunch crowd, the place was still packed though which is a sign of I guess how good the place is.   The food I ordered was fresh and good, the employees were friendly and the place overall was clean.   If it's your first time like it was for me, it takes you a moment as there is a lot going on inside lol. There is a general store type inside with healthy food items and a lot of  "stuff" like little oddities which I didn't get a chance to look around as to how busy and compact the area was.   Parking......OMG....haha. It is freakin a nightmare, good luck with that! There is parking in the back but even that was packed when I went. It is on a busy corner and the strip mall is busy itself with very limited parking so it make take you a minute to find a spot. Just know that in advance and you'll be great .    Overall good place, I'll be back to try their coffee another day.

In the area and wanted to check this place out with my sons. I called ahead to make sure of the hours of operations and that it's open to the public due to any parties going on. Nothing was said when I called, we show up a little after 5 to be told there is a party in a little bit and they will be closing for it. So we wasted our time driving there for nothing, yup pretty much.  My boys were very disappointed to say the least.    Looking at other reviews for here, this seems to happen more often than not. Some sort of communication protocol needs to be put in place so families don't waste their time and money for nothing.   We won't be returning.

I come here now and then with my sons after school or on a hot day.   Great place, typical of what you'd expect from flavors and toppings from a yogurt shop. The staff has always been ok, as of late they have seemed to had a change in employees and the ones we've come into contact with are very friendly and nice.    Keep up the great job!

I was excited when I found out there was one on my side of town, we always go to the Scottsdale location.     We stopped in later in the evening on Sat night.  Ice cream was great, place was clean. The staff was friendly, really could not ask for anything better from a visit.   Most defiantly will be coming back when our "sweet tooth" hits again lol.

Heard good things from a colleague so wanted to try it out. I stopped in for breakfast with a buddy. The employees were friendly, place was clean and the food was great. The place had a steady flow to it and was near packed for most of the time we were there but it still remained clean and overall just a good atmosphere.    I'll be going back to try their desserts as they had a good selection and they were calling my name.....lol.
