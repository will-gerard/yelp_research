The food is AMAZING as always...but the service here puts them above the rest when it comes to breakfast/brunch places! Rosemary, Sandy (& Carmen too!) have fun attitudes and personalities...it just makes the dining experience extra special!

New patient. My appt was at 11am with Dr. Valderhaug, and 45 min later still not seen. No one even checked in on me until my hubby had to say something. Nine patients checked in after me and were seen within 15 min. So far, not a good experience here...Having 2nd thoughts about this place.

Well after finally being seen, I had to update my rating from a 1-star to a 4-star. The medical assistant Desiree was very pleasant and provided an explanation (and an apology ) for running so late. Dr. Valderhaug also apologized upon entering the exam room, and boy was I glad I stayed for my appt! Basically I just downloaded my health history problems & concerns and am eager to get started on my path to wellness! Dr Valderhaug was a great listener, and was very sympathetic to my health issues. She offered advice in layman's terms and even printed up the information we talked about! Nice! After being seen, I am even more enthusiastic about Lifescape Medical Associates, and am looking forward to getting my health and overall well-being on the right track!

Ryan McKinley is a color genius and stylist extraordinaire. When I first moved to AZ five years ago, it was difficult to find someone who knew how to replicate what my stylist did in Michigan. I went to various salons and left unhappy. I found Etch (b/c they carried Kerastase products) and was elated that they were only two minutes from home. I explained that I wanted their best colorist, and so they booked me with Ryan. I remember the receptionist saying, "He does the owner's color..." and that was enough for me. My first appt in his chair...and he nailed it! I'm not a hair expert, so when he asked me what I wanted done, I didn't know what to tell him. My roots were growing out, and my hair had undergone so many different processes (I'm asian, so my hair went from black to blonde with highlights)...it was all kinds of blondes/caramels. So he combed his fingers through my hair, examining it....and a couple hours later, VOILA! He replicated what my stylist in MI had done! I had found my stylist!   Five years later, I'm still with Ryan and it's because of his skills that I get to rock this mop!  As much as it's been through (from blonde highlights to really blonde, to lowlights), my hair is so healthy! Every time I get up from his chair, I think he's achieved my favorite color yet...until next time I see him! Haha! Aside from that, I ALWAYS leave Etch feeling fabulous! Ryan has a way of styling my hair and making me feel like celebrity. Even if I request a simple blowout, I get a glamorous, sexy style! Or if I'm going out, he'll make it big & voluminous (and sexy)! For New Year's Eve, I even rocked a faux hawk! For an interview, he curled it with a flat iron! (Yes, I got the job!) I have a blast when I sit in his chair! He makes the appt so much fun! I highly recommend booking Ryan! It'll be one of the best investments you'll ever make!  PS. He also makes great restaurant recommendations!

Amazing Food! Mussels are Deeelish! Great service! I feel bad for not remembering the name of our waitress but she was always smiling, and that's so refreshing nowadays! The place is small and could use better table placing b/c we felt cramped. But overall, love this place! Definitely telling friends and will be back!

This place is not what it used to be. Came here on a Sunday for an anniversary dinner on Memorial Day weekend and was highly disappointed.  We booked our reservations through OpenTable, mentioned that we were celebrating our anniversary and requested patio seating. When we arrived, the hostess and possibly the manager dressed in a suit and tie did not even greet us Happy Anniversary. The manager showed us to our table, and our chairs were both filled with yellow flowers from a nearby Palo Verde tree. We wiped off our chairs. You would think that given the caliber of restaurant BLT is, the mgr would have had someone wipe off the chairs for us. Not a good start. In fact, when he sat another couple next to us we overheard another gentlemen guest say, "this is ridiculous."  As for the food, it was MEH. Underwhelming. We started by sharing the tomato & burrata (caprese) salad. I've had better burrata (@ Rusconi's). Hubby had the rack of lamb and I had the Dover Sole. Given the $60 price, I was expecting the Dover sole to knock my socks off, but that was not the case. Not worth the price. Should be priced around $32. Dessert was the only thing delicious: Peanut Butter mousse with Banana ice cream. They actually wrote in chocolate, Happy Anniversary!  In fact, The only person who greeted us happy anniversary was the girl who refilled our water; she read the dessert plate! No acknowledgement from the manager, hostess, not even our waitress wished us a Happy anniversary...but only the smiling girl who we filled our water!  Another surprise was that they charged us for dessert. Granted it's a nice surprise when they comp it... We were at Eddie V's the night before and they compd our dessert. Earlier in the day we were at iPic Movie theater and the waiter even insisted on buying us dessert! BLT? Nope. Not even for a special occasion. It would've been a nice touch, but the way our dinner experience was going, I wasn't surprised.  One more note to add: our busboy was a little "rough around the edges." Again, given the top-notch service that BLT is known for, he needed some more training in fine dining service. He was a little annoying/rude (plunking down new silverware versus setting it down gently); didn't make our experience an enjoyable, romantic evening.   BLT is a nationally acclaimed restaurant known for its impeccable food and service. Unfortunately it was a miss on both counts tonight. We've celebrated special events here several times and tonight was not up to par. The view was the only thing special about this evening. Tonight was disappointing actually. Don't think we'll return here anytime soon.

Went here for a Bday party. First time. Great setup and decent food. Although traffic flow at the pool tables needs work. DJ is a nice touch. Grace was our lane server and was very attentive to our group of about 20. She provided excellent service with smile!

They have private rooms! Went on a Sat night for a Birthday party for 22, and can I just say I felt the service far exceeded our expectations for a Sat night AND a large party! Alex S. was one of two servers for our group, and my hubby and I felt like we were the only 2 in the party! He was so attentive and very accommodating to everyone in our party...and did it all with a smile and a great, fun attitude!! Love him! The other wait staff was just as wonderful!! What a bonus to the amazing food! The pre-selected menu was deeeelish! Everything served was beautifully prepared, perfect portions, so fresh, so tasty, so delectable! The chef did an AMAZING job! Again, for a large party you don't expect much, but we were so impressed with Arrogant Butcher's stellar service and quality, scrumptious food...we are definitely coming back and spreading the word! Being there for a friend's birthday was special enough, but a BIG THANK YOU to the chef and wait staff (Alex S!!) for making it a pretty incredible dining experience!!

DONT GO. THIS PLACE SUCKS. My girlfriend and I came here on a Sat night (Jan 10th) around 11pm. BAD idea. We walk up the stairs...No one was carding at the entrance. We sat at the bar and witnessed:  1) Obnoxious drunk people dancing around, bumping into people, falling! NO security. There was a police presence(2), but they must've been on break. Mgmt nor staff paid attention to the ruckus the drunkards were causing.  2) A bartender was serving an underage kid (he looked like he was 16/17yo!) beer. Jokingly, I asked this "kid" to see his license and he flips me the bird! Yep, definitely UNDER AGE. No wonder noone was checking ID at the entrance!   3) LOW on stock?! I overheard they were out of cranberry juice, Manadrin vodka, some type of beer and almost out of Grey Goose! And this is a bar...on a Saturday night...seriously?!  The pictures on the website are SO DECEIVING, but maybe because the majority of the customers came from a motor cross show (lol!), but this place is NOT POSH AT ALL like the pics on the website lead you to believe. It was not a sophisticated place at all: chairs were all scattered about, sofa cushions topsy turvy, tons of cigarette butts on the stair landing! Whoever was on mgmt that night, was not running a tight ship.   This place needs a major overhaul on staff: get bouncers/security, professional bartenders who are attentive to customers, stock up the bar.   Good luck! The only thing going for this place is location...Oh and the DJ, but that's about it. This place is disappointing! Would never go back again.

Even after the mediocre reviews, we decided to give this place a try.  Sat night, 8:45pm, place was NOT BUSY. We waited, waited and waited at the hostess stand...a waiter grabbed something from the hostess stand, said hello. He didn't even flag anyone down to seat us! ...Then we did more waiting. I saw what looked like the hostess arguing with someone at the sushi bar... She finally looked over but it was too late. We made up our mind to leave.  We were out the door walking to our car, when the hostess came out from the restaurant and asked if she could help us! By that time, our mind was made up...This is not a place we want to dine at! First impressions are EVERYTHING and that was a BAD first impression. After reading all the other reviews, Good Luck Sakura...I hope you work on your customer service, or you won't be around much longer.

Here's a tip for the staff behind the counter who wait on customers: please be patient with those who have no idea what to order. Don't give a heavy sigh, look irritated or give customers a feeling that you're bothering them...umm...how about offering suggestions to customers on what is popular? Or helping them out in figuring out what they would like? The Owner of this place should focus training their staff on providing customer service with a smile. The 4 stars is for the cute seating area, music selection and for the yummy snoh flavors, toppings and glaze options! Service is more like 1-2 stars.

5 Stars is for Brunch service.  Decor is clean, simple yet elegant. 3rd time here for Sunday Brunch and will definitely be back for more! Excellent food & service every time! Chopped salad and Brussel sprouts apps are amazing! Ask for Jared's section...he knows the menu and makes tasty recommendations! He also makes you feel like you're his only table!

You have to check this place out! It's absolutely gorgeous compared to other nail salons! It's new, clean and sanitary. They even have a mini fridge stocked with coke, diet coke & bottled water!   Service is 5 star: Jen is an excellent nail technician! I followed her to her new place because she is the best at what she does! Plus it's always fun to chit chat with her like we've known each other for years!   Richie gives an ahhmazing pedicure: He takes his time and when he massages your feet/legs, he incorporates pressure points!   They also offer waxing & lash services as well. You truly get your money's worth here! Check them out and you'll be glad you did!

Attn Mgmt: Please hire more staff trained with a sense of urgency for weekend/high traffic days. I waited for one hour and by the time I ordered, there was no "sorry for the wait" or "thanks for waiting." Also, I noticed that the staff working behind the counter were just leisurely working at a snails pace, despite the long line that went to the sidewalk.  The ice cream sandwiches were okay and hot pressed cookies were HARD. On the up side, great that you can customize your sandwich. Overall, so NOT WORTH waiting in line.
