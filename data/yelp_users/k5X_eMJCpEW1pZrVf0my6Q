East Valley Residents: We are lucky to have this Cornerstone to AZ microbrews right in the heart of Tempe.  Its off the beaten path so you wont find this place filled with frat boys and party crashers.  To know the beer is to love this place, but to try the food is to be OBSESSED! Not just your typical pub food.  Also, the lay out is wonderful... The patio is partially covered or fully open.  Late night happy hour on pitchers, pints, and apps are a win. I'm actually going to late happy hour tonight for some house made chicken fingers and edamame with a pitcher of Raj. :)

I am a huge fan of Pita Jungle and all its locations.  The tempe one is walking distance from my aparment so I'm a little biased. Last night my family that lives in Surprise came to visit me and we I decided to take them there. My 12yr old sister was really hesitant towards the menu but fell in love with the Chicken and Cheese Pita Crisp and home made pita chips. My stepdad was even more weary since he was just getting over some nasty food poisoning.  I ordered for him and got him the Grilled Lavosh Shwarma wrap.  Being a meat and potato type he looked at me like I was crazy but he devoured it faster than it came out!  The grilled veggie salad is an easy go-to but the lemon dressing was a little intense for me. The Taboule salad is wonderful, and all of the different Hummus' are prefectly smooth and tasty. Love this place

About once a week I find myself saying, "wanna go to Green?!?!"   I can't get over the no-frills, cafe-esque atmosphere with purely good veg head food. Mind you, I am not a vegetarian anymore, but I do prefer to eat foods of that nature. My boyfriend is a meat-and-potatoe type but still can find his fill here.   Careful friends, it is easy to drive right by here. It is located in a dowdy looking gray strip mall... but oh-so-conviently next to a bike shop.   There are a few "mock" foods here, but gooooooooooood mock foods. The wings are really tasty. But, they were voted for the best mock chicken in the valley a couple years back.   Meat eaters, do not be afraid. This place is delicious. Whether you're feeling adventurous or just wanting something light... you cold definitely find something really great and satisfying here.

I used to love this place. i tanned regularly for two years.... because i didn't know any better. I paid 60$ a month for a level 3 (Gold) membership. Please!!!! I found the same membership level at BB and OneStop for dang near half that price.  One one hand though, they do have a great selection of lotions, yet the computers were always down, or I was getting over charged.. yadda yadda. Go somewhere else.

This is not a literal four-star rating (well, technically it is...) Think of it more like a 4.75   The ONLY reason why I have to dock that .25 is because of the selection. Don't get me wrong.... this place is a small boutique with very very beautiful body jewelry. But if you're looking for something not-so-super-duper-special you may have to go on-line or to a larger store.   Now, I must say that HTC, Tempe is the most hygienic and sterile store I have ever seen without losing its personality. This is a funky little boutique with about four piercers. Every single one of them are down to earth and personable.... which is vastly different than other parlors in town, or may I say ahem... 'clubs' in town???   The piercers are fun and understanding.. let me tell you, I was a big baby during one specific stretch to my ears and Dana just laughed... let me pace around for a second... and then just kept on going. Half the time they'll give you discounts just for the heck of it.   So, I said that this place doesn't have a large selection.. which is true to an extent. What they do specialize in is handmade, mostly one of a kind pieces. There is a designer they have that makes gauges from the inside of a watch or clock. Each one is so neat to see. They also have their own person who makes wooden pieces. They have some seriously amazing pieces and some seriously awesome people.

Around 150 beers... team trivia... no nonsense. A cruisers paradise and and eclectic mix of people. Beer snobs and frat kids alike! You always find something you like with the super knowledgable bartenders/staff, and you will never feel out of place. I love love love this bar. There are different happy hours every night and Team Trivia on Tuesdays  Oh, ps. This is NOT a sports bar... there are handful of older televisions through the place so go to BWW if you're looking for a game.

This is definitely another Tempe gem. If you are a fan of locally made spirits then you MUST check this place out. It is adjoined to its parent liquor store Tops and the bartenders are the same people you see checking you out while picking up a six pack.   This place is really special because not only does it specialize in micro/craft, local brews and wine, they have any other sort of spirit you could want! Literally there is cooler after cooler of bottled spirits that you grab and then buy, Not your normal deal but you could get lost for days in those things. Basically anything and everything they sell in the store, they have chilled next door for you enjoy.   The lounge is VERY small yet comfortable. A few couches, plush love seats and coffee tables. The bar itself is pretty small.. about 10 chairs filled with local color.   You should probably eat before going there since they do not serve food there... I mean there are like a hand full of some apps but nothing really tasty. I had the spinach dip once when I was starving but it was something that came from a package and then microwaved. The food there is basically a just-in-case type thing....   Tops is off the regular beaten Mill path and it has the hands down greatest beer selection for a bar in Tempe. It is great intimate lounge, not a place to see and be seen (unless if you're a super cool hipster... :) )

I could not find my local EWC which is in the Tempe Marketplace but since they are a chain and they hold a high standard of cleanliness and professionalism through out all thier stores.  All stores use a thick dark blue wax that is not as hot as regular wax and it does not require strips.  You see them throw the wax and sticks away immediately after use to ensure cleanliness.  I've been to three different women each time for my brazillian but all three were very professional and made me feel comfortable although I was panty-less and spread wide.  The prices are straight-forward and very reasonable.

Big fan of this place. The staff are so nice and helpful. Unfortunately, this location is a little small.  The one on Scottsdale Rd is AMAAAAAZING though!! The beds regularly changed and lights swapped out frequently. The lotions are nicely priced compared to other places.  The level 2 unlimted is also waaaay cheaper than other places.

In my other reviews you'll see that I love nearly all the Fox Restaurants. Which is true. For Zinburger, this is where the *nearly comes in.   I've eaten there more than a few times and on every occasion its been OK. -Which is why it gets 2 stars- The menu is tiny, but its a gourmet burger joint so you really can't ask for much else. The zucchini fries are triumphant. Truly wonderful. The burgers sound amazing when reading them but more than once they've come out just OK. Nothing terrible, but not as mouthwatering as they made them sound. I like how the wine list is portioned out too... pretty cut and dry. Don't bother asking your server about the wines though, they probably will just look at you with a stupid look on their face.   If you're with a big burger person and you're not a burger person, do not fret. They have TWO really good salads, so don't get too excited. My favorite is the one with pomegranate seeds and goat cheese, with or without chicken. Its very light and fresh.   On my last occasion my server was slow, meek, and dull. Having zero personality is one thing, but when she realized she forgot about my glass of wine and I had to remind her (about ten minutes later) she became very timid and hardly even came back to our table! I wasn't rude.. so I don't understand why she had a manager come by to drop it off. Anyway, it could just be me.   So all in all this place isn't bad FOOD wise... drinks are pricey and service has tended to suck.

So the two-star rating on here says it all: Meh, I've experienced better. So true of the BBW in Tempe.  Everytime I go there it's practically empty - which I guess doesn't ALWAYS signify a bad establishment - but in this case I think it may.    The wing Tuesdays are nice and cheap, and as long as you're drinking domestic beers (crappy domestics...) then your bill won't be so high. I was really P-O'd when I found out that local beers didn't count as $3 domestics!!! Hello, Four Peaks is right down the road and you're gonna charge me 6.50 for a pint during HAPPY HOUR?!  Please.  Also, skip the boneless wings. They are just glorified, over breaded chicken nuggets. Ick.

I've said it once I've said it a million times. I love (almost all) Fox Concepts. The Butcher is another delicous brain child that is a litte reminicent of Culindary Dropout. The fondue is the same at both places which is kind of sad, but other things on the menu really make up for it.  The foi gras was perfectly portioned and moderatly priced. The butternut squash salad was phenomonal. I highly recomment it!  The ambience and decor are both very aethestheically pleasing.. especially with the open kitchen. The wine list is nice and the service was good too.
