Stopped by for lunch today and ordered the Chicken Shawarma. Food is very flavorful and the Shawarma had just the right balance of yellow curry! I would definitely stop by again.   My only criticism would be the price for what you get seems a little off. I was happy to not feel stuffed after eating, but I also wasn't full. For the price, I would suggest maybe adding a second Shawarma/Gyro.

If you're looking for authentic, great tasting barbecue, you've found it! The Midwest Monster is my personal favorite and the sides are made fresh and have fantastic flavors. Add more flavor with one of their delicious sauces and you're set! I like the Sweet and Mild sauce!!

Nora is great and does the best fades hands down! I'll keep coming back just for her!  Everyone is very friendly, professional and they maintain a clean shop. It's a welcoming shop and safe for all types, including kids. You don't have to worry about inappropriate or foul language.  Try them out, you won't regret it!!

Great Chicken Pad Thai! Definitely recommend and will be going back! Ease of ordering for take out and the food was delicious. Perfect balance of taste, spice and flavor.

Food tastes good, but the service is terrible!  My wife and I ate lunch here and ordered a chicken chimi a la carte and I ordered the beef and chicken enchiladas combo, which includes rice and beans.  Our food came out quickly as we were the only guests at the time. My wife's plate came with a few pieces of lettuce garnishing her plate, so I asked for more. You would have thought I asked for nuclear codes based on the look the worker gave me. He looked at me completely confused so I clarified again, "just some extra lettuce on the side".  He mumbled something about buttons and being unsure of how to help me. I ended up walking away and just giving her the extra lettuce on my plate.  My combo plate ended up being just two enchiladas, with no rice or beans. I asked where my sides were and the cashier stated she thought I only wanted a la carte. I said, "no, I wanted the combo." Again, another puzzled look from a different worker so I said forget it and went back to my table.  I can understand the mistake of missing the combo, but at least offer to make it right.   Needless to say, with the horrid service experienced, we won't be back which is unfortunate because the food was good.

I rushed here after work and got here 30 minutes before closing time (5:30p). They had a "sorry we're full sign" taped to the door and the closed sign up. Not good business! There were 2 people waiting, but 3-4 barbers working. They could have easily accepted more customers before closing time. One barber even made eye contact with me through the window and just let me walk away with sheer disappointment on my face!!  I've heard of closing up 5-10 minutes before closing time, but 30 minutes?! That's just bad business!  I'll go find somewhere else more accommodating. If you say you close at 6pm, honor it!

Worst service experience, period. I called ahead of time to make sure they would be open and was advised they would be open until 5pm. I am traveling for work in the morning and needed to squeeze in a fresh cut before leaving.  I arrived at the barber shop at 1:30pm to be greeted by the two guys working only to be told they were closed now. I explained that I even called ahead and was told they would be open until 5pm. The guy (I believe to be the owner) said something came up and they had to close. I understand that life happens, but it was apparent they were closing early due to it being slow as neither seemed to be in much of a hurry. I asked if they could get me in quick and the answer was "we gotta go".   Needless to say, I wouldn't recommend this place. Even if you had to deliver bad news like an unexpected closure, at least offer to make it right next time? Maybe a free cut next visit for inconvenience?!

Great food, clean environment and friendly owner/staff! I'm somewhat of a food junkie and like to find places off the beaten path. I seek out non-chain restaurants and stumbled on Naked BBQ on Yelp. 28 reviews and 5 stars, I was intrigued.  The place lived up to the hype!  Upon entering the restaurant and studying the menu for the first time, we were greeted by who I presume was the owner as he made his way from behind the counter to greet us in line. He welcomed us to the establishment and explained how their food was prepared and how the menu worked. It made the seemingly unknown adventure more enjoyable, welcoming and comfortable.   The food is delicious and the BBQ sauces are a great compliment of flavor without being overwhelming. The owner made a point to make his rounds in the dining room, sharing gratitude for the patronage and playing with the kids that were dining.    It was a great lunch and refreshing to see the engaged ownership and passion for what he's doing.  I'll be back!
