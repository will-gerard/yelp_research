I really want to give this beautifully designed resturant a glowing review and say that the food and service matched the great decor.  Unfortunately after waiting ten minutes (felt like 20) after being seated by the bartender and then completely ignored, we decided to go somewhere that would not only acknowledge our existence but would also feed us.  The final straw which dictated our exit was the table next to us explaining to the waiter who was bringing out a side that they had ordered with their main dish, that they were finished eating, they no longer wanted the side but just the check.  I might go back for a cocktail sometime,  after they have worked out their complete lack of service.
