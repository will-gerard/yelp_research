What happened to this great place? New owners? Was our favorite place to go - now is just plain BAD!!! "home made bread" for toast was thin, cheap store-bought, "thick cut challa" french toast was made out of the same crappy store-bought bread. Never got refills on my coffee, creamer curdled when put in my cup, Over easy eggs were over cooked, and to boot, the waiter looked like he just rolled out of bed and put on week-old dirty crumpled clothes. Gross! What a waste of a beautiful morning and $40.

Amazed at the good reviews here. Maybe the heat is affecting their tastebuds? The Sunflower specialty drink was bitter and not shaken well so it was barely cold. When the new bartender came on, I asked him to reshake it and add more sugar to the rim as it was (and I said this loud enough for him to hear) the best thing about the drink - he never even asked if I liked it or not (I didn't finish it). The Jicima salad was tasteless and would have been better as a plate decoration under a piece of fish or chicken. All the raw onion in the salad I, unfortunately, was able to taste for hours. The ribs were just ok. We had to cut our losses at that time and move on to somewere better.  Ambiance is good. I hear the pizzas are good. If I do go back, I'll opt for a pizza and a beer. Then again, there are LOTS of pizza and beer joints that cost a lot less and have good parking.

Expect to pay more for drinks in Scottsdale bars, but Narcisse has gone to new levels (and I'm not talking their second story location).  During a daytime event I ordered a Malibu and coke. It came short with (lots of) ice, a shot of Malibu- $8  and maybe 4oz of Coke $4.   Yes - they charged for the mixer. $4 for about 4 oz of coke?  $12 for a short, not even top shelf drink? NEVER AGAIN!!!!!   To ad insult to injury, the waitress was terrible.  **UPDATE** Thanks to great their attention to detail and answering client's concerns so quickly, I'm changing my rating. Glad to hear the drinks are NOT supposed to be charged that way. Way to go Narcisse. I'll come again. Maybe order a beer this time.....:)

A perfect way to start the day! Just had breakfast here and it was great! Staff was friendly, owner was available and attentive. Did not feel rushed to get out like at so many local breakfast places. Noise level was very low (again, not like other places that assault your ears first thing). Food came out fast. Caraf of coffee and water (so appreciated!) Prices were great! We had french toast - great! With REAL warmed maple syrup. And eggs benedict - yummy! Cooked to perfection. I love that it is locally owned and the owner is there making sure things go ok.

Great food, but I'm giving one star for the bad customer service. Had the same exact experience that Robert F. had. Ordered the peach beer and it was horrible - sent it back and waiter said he would ask manager to take it off - and the manager said no. Seriously? It was not drinkable - and probably cost them nothing - now they lost me and any future income from me and my work friends (I just vetoed a big work party to go there). I actually went on the same day as the other reviewer - so maybe it was just the beer was bad - sad that we had to pay for it.

Wonderful, friendly spot to enjoy some great wine and beer. My husband and I had "date" night here. Great prices and selection. I did the wine flight and all the selections were amazing. They had appetizers out for customers to enjoy, but I opted to order their cheese plate (the one food item they have) and it was lovely! Great quality cheese and the presentation of the plate was beautiful. They have a large patio area outside which I look forward to enjoying in the spring.

Drink here...then you may be able to palette the food.   Cool atmosphere had us excited that we were about to taste something different. And we did!   Just not in a good way.  We ordered the Dungeness Crab Ceviche ($15) "Dungeness Crab, watermelon, olive, mint, citrus" and it was ALL watermelon chunks with small bits of crab clinging to it. The watermelon was not ripe, slightly slimy and the hint of crab just added a fish hint to it. The waitress tried to explain that that is how this seasonal ceviche is served...mostly watermelon, and the others were like a typical ceviche (I guess meaning there is actually more than a tablespoon of fish used) yet they are all described the same way on the menu.   Also ordered was the lentil salad. Zucchini, sweet potato, red and green onion and cilantro vin. What I got was a pile of cold, TASTELESS lentils. Urgh.  When I got up within minutes to get the check and told the waitress it was all horrible she tried to convince us to try something else. We were, of course, totally over Taco Haus at this point and just wanted out. She had heard my son say he wanted cake, so she did get us a piece to go, but as for the bill.....She CHARGED US for all the other food we had only taken a bite of! Wow. That better be one damn good piece of $30 "complimentary" cake.   I think I need a drink to dull the memory of Taco Haus....but I won't be back there to get it.

Was so excited after hearing all the hype about this place. Looked cool, dishes sounded interesting. But, that is where it ended. Our service was SO terrible. By terrible, I mean....what service? We rarely saw our waitress. Our food came out at such totally different times over the course of an hour that some people at our table of 8 were finished long before the others even started. The food was meh. I was expecting better or even more interesting than what hit my tastebuds. Any higher end sushi place has similar, and even better flavor combos now. The one highlight was the mushroom tacos. We all agreed it was our favorite. I'd recommend to go to see and be seen, hang in a cool spot, but don't come hungry.
