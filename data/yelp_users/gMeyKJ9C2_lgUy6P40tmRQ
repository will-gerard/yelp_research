My husband and I ordered delivery tonight from Venezia's. The person on the phone, I believe his name was Ryan, was very friendly and had excellent customer service. However, we asked for honey hot wings and they said we can have it tossed in hot and they will give us a side of honey. How hard is it to just toss them in honey hot, I mean you have the honey! They also charged us $.50 for the honey, really?!  We got the pizza delivered in good time and the driver was friendly. The carrots and celery package was pathetic. Below you will find a picture of what we got. And what we saw when we opened the wings. We had a bare bone. Why serve that?  The pizza was good and the wings had good flavor (after we poured our $.50 honey in a bowl and re-tossed them).  I was disappointed with the few things that made me say "seriously?". But the customer service and pizza were better than most.

Great place to unwind and dine. Love the low key atmosphere and the patio is a comfortable hangout for friends and family. Prices are very reasonable and the food is delicious! The staff and bartender were very attentive and friendly

Always great food and friendly service. They have a large variety too. Burrito, tacos and quesadillas, as well as, sandwiches, burgers, and bratwurst. Also their portions are very big. Nachoes are huge!   The prices are the best part! Very affordable!

This was the worse haunted house attraction I've been to ever. My friends and I go every year to a haunted house and I look forward to that outing every year as I do not get to go out often. We chose Scarizona because it was new and in the east valley (finally we didn't have to drive for an hour). We always buy the fast pass to skip the long cumbersome lines and did so again for Scarizona. Well we found out that "long line" and "Scarizona" sure do not go together. This was beyond short lines though. There were no lines. And even more, there were NO OTHER PEOPLE. Maybe, at most, there were 2 or 3 other groups of people scattered around the grounds.   Now I know some may think 'that's awesome to not have to battle crowds' and normally I would too if the haunted house themselves were anything more than, darkness, a few lights, well dressed actors, and walking. Oh and a dangerous metal grated step in the course that is NOT lit and has NO warning. I fell HARD! My friends almost had to help me walk back to the car. Its been a week and my knees still hurt. I'm actually debating going to the doctor to get xrays done.   To sum it up, I am very disappointed with the new attraction, the fast pass was worthless and a waste of $10, and the houses were dangerous.
