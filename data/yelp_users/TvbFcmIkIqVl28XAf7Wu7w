Wow. The lady brought me here for dinner and I am so glad she did.   It's Friday night and this place is popping. I had to park in the parking lot next door. When we came in, the hostess asked if we had reservations - we didn't, but they had us seated in no time. We got seated and It was loud! Lots of happy folks talking and eating. That's a good sign!  After a brief wait, they brought out delicious bread and pesto. It was yummy!  For dinner, I had the meat and cheese lasagna. It was a treat. It had a somewhat of a light texture and was just delicious. The lady ordered rigatoni ala vodka with shrimp. I was jealous at first just by looking at it, but she was nice enough to trade halfway through. Lucky me - that was delicious as well!  We finished off with the cheesecake. It wasn't the best I ever had, but it was good.  So that was my experience.  I hope this place is here forever, because I'd like to make it back a few times.

Meh xican food. That's how I'd have to describe this.  We were promptly seated. We were quickly attended to. Drinks ordered and they brought out chips and salsa quickly. The mild salsa was sweet. Wah. The spicy was really spicy. Mixed them together and it ended up working out.  We ordered a cheese crisp. That came quick. It wasn't too substantial.   The good deal was 3.75 margarita. I got a frozen one and id say it was worth it.   For dinner, I got the pollo especial. This is their version of the chicken chimichanga with jalapeño cream cheese. You can get this, called various different names, at many different restaurants in the Phoenix metro area. There is a pretty good baseline to compare to. I don't remember the wait being anything annoying, so It must have come out in a reasonable amount of time.  The food was annoying. For me, Arizona is a beacon of Mexican food hope. You should be able to bring your friends and family from out of state and have them taste what Mexican food should taste like. Just like every dick from New York or Chicago tells you how great their shitty pizza is, so shall an Arizonan blabber about the Mexican food. This food was not bragable . If this meal was typical of Manuel's, it will let you down. This pollo especial was very bland. Nothing stood out. Not the chicken. Not the jalapeño cream cheese, the beans, the rice, nada. I'll bet you can get the same flavors in Idaho or Nebraska, and that is just sad.  So, to make a long story short, I'll be skipping Manuel's for the indefinite future. If you choose not to, I wish you good luck.

Delicious. The restaurant is beautiful and the food is better than your average strip mall Chinese place. We had the Egg Rolls which were big, like mini burritos; crab puffs, which were stuffed full of yummy stuffing and not tiny either; cashew chicken, which was tender and juicy and flavorful; and general Tso, which was crisp and full of fresh veggies. The service was fast and friendly as well. The only ding I would say is the prices, which are a buck or two more than what I'd say is average, but they gotta pay Scottsdale rent, so it is what it is. That wouldn't stop me from coming back though, and it shouldn't let you either,

My coworkers had brought Lamar's in on several different occasions, and I had enjoyed them every time.  Today when I went in to work, the coworkers were feeling Donutty, and I was volunteered to be the buyer of today's dozen.  Rolled on down, and they had a drive through. I really wasn't feeling the menu and nobody talked to me anyways, so I pulled thru. Glad I did.  Parked, went into a nice clean store with a dizzying array of large delicious looking donuts. Yum.   The lady that helped me was very nice and she served me up my dozen to go.  My only issue from giving the 5 stars would be the price. Just seemed a few bucks too steep, but hey, I guess it's a rough world and you have to stay in business.  I will likely keep patronizing BoSa regularly, but if you are like a picky BMW driving blonde white soccer mom who maybe BoSa  is a little too scary for, Lamar's is the choice for you.

Hooray!!!! I found another Hawaiian restaurant that I like!   OK. Many moons ago, I lived by an Ono. Many moons later, I moved away, but I would drive past one on my long commute. Then I moved right near my work and no more Ono. So then I see I lived near an L&L. I can once again be happy, right??? WRONG! L&L suuuuuuucccccked. So I just gave up on my Hawaiian food love affair.   Fast forward to this evening. I had to quell my craving. So I see what the next nearest place is, and here I land.   The place was very busy when I came in, but the wait was not long. I'm a big beefy sumbich and I know what I like, and what o like is a BBQ mix with all Mac. Sure as shiitake, they have it! Ordered, sat, and waited. Food took a reasonable amount of time. They brought it to me.   Now I'm a sauce loving mofo, and their teriyaki is the thick kind that I like. They also have katsu. They come in cups, but they are not the lil tiny cups, they are the next size up. Sweet! Got 2 of each. The sauces were great! Not too salty. Sometimes that gets messed up at other places.   The meats were great and reasonably portioned, based on my experience. The Mac was yummy too! I'm looking forward to coming back soon.  Do be warned, they are busy and they don't have a large dining area. They may not have a place to sit if you come when they are busy.

Ric's is right near my work, so they get a lot of business from my coworkers, especially my boss. Because of this, I end up there a few times a month.  If I would have yelp when Chef J was here, this place likely would have received 4 stars. But he's gone now, and so it appears is any of the appeal of coming here on my own.   I know this is a review, and I'm sure I should be very detailed, but I wouldn't expect to leave this place with a smile on your face in regards to the food, service, or ambiance.   It's not total crap, they do get two stars I guess, the food is edible, its not a total sh*thole, but lately it has just been "meh".   I'd recommend passing on Rics for now and going to Pork On A Fork or unfortunately even Shane's.

Update: Sadly appeared to be out of business as of 11/16/2013. A letter from the landlord was posted on the door. If so, RIP. Please come back soon!  This is the best Indian Buffet I have been to so far.   Their selection varies every time and sometimes they don't have the exact combo of stuff on the buffet that I like, but regardless, i haven't been to another Indian buffet that has been able to match the quality of their offerings.  I'm sure one might be upset that I have given them 5 stars, but I am giving this rating for their weekend dinner buffet. You likely can go somewhere and get better individual dishes, but as far as buffets go, they currently win in my book.  I recommend their Garlic Naan, vegetable Pakora, Paneer Tikka Masala, and their Butter Chicken is the Bee's Knees! SOMF!
