I've never experienced this before, but I'm just going to let you be the judge:  I am starting to watch/count my calorie load, especially when I am eating out.  American Chinese is famous for huge calorie loads in the sauces and fried treatments, so I thought I would split the middle and order a brown steamed rice with broccoli and beef.  Well, I asked the young lady behind the counter for the calorie count chart and she quickly said she would have to ask someone. No problem and expected...but what happened next was not:  She walked to the back of the galley-style kitchen past the viewing, walkin freezer to find her manager. Outside of the freezer is the prep area with a large gray garbage can. She stood there, asking her question, HOLDING THE GARBAGE CAN. Then she and the manager walked back to me.  The manager came with the paper and placed it on the prep line. And she grabbed a bowl to serve me. WAAAAAAIT! "Uh, excise me. Is that a garbage can?" I asked. She looked back and asked where. "There...in front of the freezer...the big gray thing with the black garbage bag stretched around the rim." "Yes". I asked her if she realized that she stood there and grabbed the rim and talked to her manager. "No," she replied. "My dear, I watched you and you not only grabbed the garbage can you just came and grabbed my bowl to serve me." She put the bowl down and walked away, washed her hands and apologized.  Needless to say, I won't be coming back.

Always a pleasure shopping here!   The folks are nice, even if a bit slow sometimes. At least I don't feel rushed...  Anyway, came for a muffin pan (got that) and looked at some Pandora-look-a-like beads (didn't have much selection, didn't get that).  Had a texted coupon and saved 1/2 and mother has the app (always coupons inside).   Shopped. Saved. Happy. Done.

This place is incredible...the selection will astound you, I promise!  If you have beads running through your blood, you have to make this place an unhealthy habit...I could never come here on a payday...just too, too many beautiful choices.  Huge selection on stone, glass, metal, plastic, handmade beads. They have accessories, chain, tools, findings, leather, ribbon, silk, synthetic and elastic supplies.  Classes, hours and variety of prices allow you to learn, buy and shop 'til you drop.  Oh and the staff are super helpful.  The icing on the top? There is a Chinese restaurant next door: you can shop 'til you nearly drop, go next door for some more fuel...and go back for another round...hahahahahha

I came in last Wednesday and needed my daughter's script filled quickly. She is severely visually impaired (has CTI-cortical visual impairment) and attends Foundation Blind School in North Phoenix.  Nikki the manager (assistant ?) was super helpful and was able to get the order processed and I picked them up in less than a week!  My experience was nearly perfect...my only want was that VSP as 'in network' for Nationwide. (Technical issue) But the store, the staff and prices & the selection are excellent. Totally worth the drive!  Ask for Alex or Nikki!!

Nice big hello when you walk in!  I had an irregular order and they fixed it quickly and well.  It nice to be able to see my meal prepared, even if it's quick serve.  It is about 'butt-cold degrees' outside and this place was warm and I was very comfortable.  The prep-station was clean and it was kinda cool that the staff was singing (on key) and happy.  If we play on this side of town again, I will ABSOLUTELY eat here again.

Too many shiny objects:  Cameras Printers TVs Rings Watches Earrings Game systems Games Tools Phones  Good variety. Clean & organized.  One thing that is a distraction and caused me to give it 4-stars is that customers and payers are all in the same line which tends to get long quickly. Maybe if they could have another system separated new buyers and those that are paying on stuff, that would be nice.

Park is wonderful. It's always clean and inviting. Whether you see families at BBQ grills or little ones on the equipment, you feel comfortable.  I like to bring dried bread-things for the geese and ducks. They are always happy I did...hahah.  I also like to walk the lake and get in a mile around (marked on the ground).

I mean, Costco...come on they have nearly everything.  But thing I like best is that they change it up. I am the home chef and now that it's gotten cooler in the desert, I'm bringing on my 'soup troupe' recipes. They have 2 types of chicken broths one can purchase. And if you don't feel like cooking your own, you can choose from two types of corn chowder, turkey sausage & kale, chicken tortilla soup, lobster bisque, clam chowder, and some others whose names are slipping my memory...  To avoid some health challenges, I've noticed also the number of gluten-free products increasing....and these products still taste very good... (Gluten-free apparently does HAVE to mean taste-free!)

Hated this place.  Essentially closed down and complete waste of my time. Wish I had known as I literally drove 45 minutes to get there...

Totally awesome customer service!  It doesn't matter if I come in the morning or the afternoon, I am always greeted with a smile. Always!  This is not your $2 or $2.50 place for which you always have to pay when you drop it off. I appreciate being able to pay when I pick up. I also appreciate when I am remembered by name. I appreciate the coupons on the back of the Fry's receipt...20% off adds up quickly.  I've had my clothes dry cleaned and washed. I had to stop using a cheap competitor after two incidents I which the clothing made my skin itch terribly. I've never been back and I've never had that problem with Laveen Cleaners.

If you want to build a business-casual wardrobe, this location is the place to start.  Let me explain.  I am transitioning from a larger size to smaller ones and as such, I am unsure of how long I will be at my current size. Having a variety...a nice variety of business casual clothes from which I can choose is awesome.  I have found silk blouses, dress blouses, dress pants and a few skirts at this location.  I have also found a few things for my kitchen (huge glass cutting board, ceramic water dispenser, baking tools).   If you've ever made it in to a GW on a Super Saturday (50% off everything except mattresses and select new items) you can usually expect a madhouse...NOT. The staff is helpful and keeps the lines in front of the change rooms under watchful eyes. They also do a good job of keep the changing rooms free of discarded items...just makes a HUGE difference to me and improves my shopping experience tremendously.

I love the sale items that go out at 11 & 2pm daily.  I like this chain for a variety of reasons:  1. They have a nice selection of prepared foods. You know how sometimes you just want to try something new, but are not sure if you will really L.I.K.E. it? And how the serving size is huge? I really appreciate that in most cases, the serving size is for two or three. That really works for my and my small family.  2. I also love shopping here because the variety is ALWAYS there...5 types of lettuces, 4 types of tomatoes, 7 types of prepared salad dressings...you get the idea.  3. Truly a good selection of variety of flavors is always available. I mean I can buy Indian bread (naan), English sponge pudding (Spotted Dick---not that I would ever eat it...Google it), Chinese soups, vegetarian meals, etc.  And the people are very helpful and give me the excellent customer service I want and deserve.   I enjoin my shopping experience with them, always.  I updated my review to 4 stars because they are open at 6AM now! Suweeet!!

Ok...here goes:  We ordered the appetizer sampler and EVERYTHING WAS JUST RIGHT!! We have all had that one platter where some stuff is under-cooked and the rest mediocre, right? Not this time...  My son ordered the Quesidilla Burger...nice presentation, I wish I had thought to snap pics before we all started. He said it was cooked just right.  My mother had a turkey & avocado sandwich with fries...huge sandwich that I seriously doubt she will finish. (Great--there's lunch).  I ordered something from the low calorie selections...don't remember it's name, but it had a steak, potatoes, stuffed portabello mushroom cap with spinach and Parmesan cheese. It tasted great.  Overall I gave it 4 stars only because  1) the air was cranked up and I was cold most of the time 2) my plate didn't look as appetizing as it tasted..again steak was well seasoned 3) the calorie counts were on a sheet that the server had to bring to me....overdue for them to have all of that info ON THE MENU.  But I will certainly come again!

Love, love....love this place!  EVERYTIME and I mean every time, I am happy I came.  They make my sushi order quickly even though the place is usually busy.  I have brought friends that have ordered from the full menu and they, too, like the food.   Broccoli is always done right: green and slightly crispy...I love it!

In Nd out...almost....seems like they were behind...  I had an appointment, but I still had to wait about 15 minutes...but good things come to those that wait: I was able to replace my iPhone cord for free.  Even though they were busy, I still felt comfortable as I browsed the displays of the ne iPads and iPad minis. I also browsed the accessories department...too, too, too many new shiny objects...hahahhaha  I noticed that the One to One tables were busy also. I will probably always be a Mac user for this one reason: I can ALWAYS get help with my systems.  My only complaint is that the locations are so few and far between in this Valley of the Sun...

I L..O..V..E..this hospital!   Many families don't have children that need acute care or have kids with an incredible diagnosis, but I do. Having this hospital and its doctors as a part of the circle of success for my Princessa is priceless.  Born with a rare and terminal brain abnormality, I am always critical about those that provide care for my daughter. Every visit here has been a good one. They are compassionate and generous and very helpful.  She is always very calm and comforted during her visits and full of smiles.  When she smiles, I smile because I know she is happy and content.    Any time and every time we have to seek care, I think of Phoenix Children's Hospital first.

Gonna wait to offer judgement...and here it is:  Had a suweet old plan in which I had unlimited DATA for three smart phones, but I was buying data for two iPads.   The sales staff was able to get us moved over to a plan that included data for the two phones, add another iPhone and three iPads for the same cost as the original plan!!!  And to be clear, I am saying we bought the third iPhone...bought three iPads...and added data for those 4 new devices AND keep data for the two existing iPads...ALL FOR THE SAME PRICE AS THE ORIGINAL PLAN! All of these devices collectively use less than 10 gigs monthly.  Customer service was excellent.

Sam was fast and sweet & my little dude had a nice cut!  The gents in here were very nice and the service was excellent. Sam is the one with a big smile and hardy laugh.  My son hates to get his hair cut, but Sam P. was so cool with him.   What more can a mother ask for? Fast, fun and painless.  Plus they are located in a shopping center that has plenty of good mom and pop food choices.

I think I have been to two C-F-A's in my life, one in Chino Hills, CA and this one.  Even though I gave it 2 stars, I really want to say this: the staff were friendly and accommodating. The manager and employees were smiling and you felt a genuine desire to serve folks. Bathrooms were clean, tables, too.  So why the 2 stars? Well, ordered the soup and salad combo...sorry I don't know the name...but the portions were nice. However, when I opened the salad container, I found two pieced of cardboard. At first I thought it was tortilla chips. Then I looked very closely to confirm that it was cardboard. I took it to the counter, showing the manager. She too was shocked and very kindly asked if I wanted a refund or and exchange. I'm not mean person nor anal retentive. She was kind and genuine and gave me excellent customer service, so I just asked for an exchange. Happily she did so and I returned to my seat to finish it and my soup.  After I was about half way through with my soup, unfortunately, I began to feel kinda sick to my stomach, felt a little queazy and a bit dizzy. And then it passed...I chalked it up to perhaps there being a bit too much salt in the soup.   But like I said, it passed and I finished both. My friend also finished her meal and we were both fine.  I might give them another try...not sure though.  And one last point: It took me about 10 minutes to find them in Yelp because they are listed under 'Chicken wings' and I don't think they sell one wing dish....very frustrating...

I ordered the Philadelphia roll. It was 8 pieces and very fresh.   Pricing was good so at $9.99.  It's a bit dark, but not uncomfortable. There was a bball game on the tv, which a bit of background noise, although the place was quiet.  The counter worker/order taker was friendly and smiled the whole time.  It's tasty and fresh! I'd come again, especially since it took them about 5 minutes to make 2 orders.

Fast...food...fast!  I am sorry that others have had slow/bad service. Maybe that was then, but now, they are pretty fast.  Typically, I order for two or three folks in my orders and rarely have they been wrong and never have they been slow.  I've had their ceviche and guacamole fries (special order-no salt) several times and was very happy with speed, amount of fries & guacamole and spice-level of the guacamole. My son has had the carne asada fries, also no salt. As well, those orders were excellent, fresh and fast.  And is say that I've eaten here maybe 15 times now...usually forget to check in, but always  am pleased. That's why I continue to come...and will continue to do so!

Let's see...where to start...  Organized...check!  Friendly...check!  This is the ONLY location of the many in which I have been that had new area rugs! They might have been the six by six or eight by eight. Anyway brand new and taped.  Interestingly, I also found their selection of jackets and coats to be better than m/any other GW's in the area. Too bad I wasn't looking for one!  As winter has rolled into the Valley of the Sun, I was happy to see that they had a nice selection of long-sleeve, upscale blouses of many colors.   Because I only had 20 minutes, it was easy...very easy to quickly pick up something because the women's section was well-organized.  But since I was looking for kitchen items, I headed to that section first. I wasn't disappointed, but I didn't find that for which I was looking (glass cutting board, ramekins and torch---yeah, right).  I would surely visit again.

I loved this place and was so sorry to see them close!  I don't know where the went or if they even re-opened somewhere, but the selection of handcrafted oils and vinegars was stunning.

Always feel safe here...I think the Police use this location as an unofficial sub-station.  I can't tell you how many times I have pulled in and seen the police, the sheriff or SWAT teams. Even though it seems kinda strange to see them in their gear and then I look over their shoulders to see...sheep...  Staff is always friendly and helpful. I have asked for calorie counts on several of their prepared food items and they are glad to get the info for me.  It's clean on the inside and out. Pumps always work, very few broken ones can be found---if ever.

Whoop! Whoop! Store is WELL-STOCKED ON SATURDAY MORNINGS!!  Yeah! I love this store!  I mean you can find snacks and some staples all at reasonable prices.  I like that two months after opening, it's still clean and organized. The produce selection is still ever-changing (mangos, pineapples, apples, avocados, bananas, red/yellow/white onions, carrots, lettuces, mushrooms, pomengranates, Brussel sprouts, red/yellow/green peppers, cactus leaves, green onions, kale, sugar cane, red/white potatoes, pumpkins, watermelons, melons, strawberries...and more...hope you get the point. Lots of variety!  My son is an athlete, so he is constantly needing fuel. I have found Gatorades and a few other sport drinks, lean protein deli (non-ham) meats, yogurts and juices (w/out high-fructose corn syrups) and fruits. And of course, waters.

You know it's going to be nice when the GM says hello to you at the door.  I drove on the lot and there were about 30 RVs waiting outside! RV season is upon is here in the desert!  I was in search of some traveling games...and to my surprise they had the New Scrabble with the locking tiles! Whoop! Whoop!   But they also had about 20 other games available that we're perfect for small places and for playing when you're on the road.  They also had a nice selection of kitchen things for RVs.  It's a drive from my side of town, but it's worth it due to the wise selection RV things---WallyWorld has nothing on them! And I really appreciate the friendly atmosphere.  Even though there lots of people in the store, the gals at checkout kept the lines moving.
