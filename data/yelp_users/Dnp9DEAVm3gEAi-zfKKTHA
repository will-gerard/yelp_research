WHAT is the big deal? Okay, I've given Ocean Club multiple chances. This place thinks it's a big deal and for some reason there's a cult following of people who don't know any better? It has never impressed. It's too crowded. I think they must have hired an engineer specifically to determine how to cram the maximum number of tables in the restaurant. The server kept bumping into my chair to get to the table next to me (I was pulled ALL the way forward and am not a large person). The team service is annoying. AND the biggest issue, psst... the food is not that good! I think people think they should be impressed and forget to expect the actual thing.

Amazing service.  I called with an emergency and Jorge Flores was at my door 20min later with a quick simple fix.  He optimized the drainage, cleaned out the lines and gave the whole unit a check up.  The cost was so affordable and the entire experience was fantastic.  As AC is so crucial in this lovely desert, we will have Flores AC back out every spring for a check up.  Thank you!!!

These guys are STILL amazing. As we heat up this week, my new AC seemed to not be blowing cold air. They were at my place in 30minutes, and found the problem in my electrical fuse box (not an AC problem). They fixed it right then, free of charge and had the house cooled right back down.  We're life long Phoenicians and will be life long Flores AC customers

Delicious breakfasting with quaint outside seating feels like you're down one of the side streets in Santa Barbara not downtown Phoenix. Hungry hangover size portions means plenty of leftovers for dinner later if that's your thing but it's so yummy you might finish it all on the spot. Rumor has it they make a dinner to match their breakfast feats, can't wait to try it out!

We had our entire house (walls, ceiling, trim, garage, etc etc) painted by AAA Painters and couldn't be happier. The outcome was totally amazing. The quality of the work was impeccable. David was easy to reach, always on time, took extra care to touch up the small details even we had overlooked, and completed the project on time. He even picked out and installed new door stoppers that matched our hinges to protect the new paint job. Also, there was no mess left behind, just the leftover cans of paint if we ever need to touch up a scuff. The $ bid was extremely competitive. Couldn't recommend highly enough... happy painting!

Very unhelpful unfriendly downright rude staff. Yes, I realize this isn't your dream job folks, but you do Work here. Staff were socializing with other teens (non staff or customers) at the front desk despite a line at the snack bar. Once finally summoned the exchange was atrocious. Staff were eating food behind the counter while preparing food for customers. Yuck and a health code violation I'm sure. We'll never go back after such a poor experience

Don't waste your time or money. Sat 7:30p, we walked in and got the best table in the place with no wait.... Not a good sign. Our server was so amped up it was concerning. The brussel sprouts came out basically uncooked. We sent them back and they came back out after we had finished our entree, super dry bland pork chop. Go somewhere else, anywhere else.

Always good. The oyster selection is top notch... Do yourself a favour and get a bubbly pairing. None of the entrees disappoint, seriously... Not even the basic Fish & Chips, delicious!  It's quickly & easily become our favorite seafood joint in Phoenix... Which means a lot coming from hubby's coastal Oregon upbringing.

A great cozy addition! This place is teeny which is part of the charm.  The owner is super friendly and enthusiastic. He shouldn't be surprised by the over night success because this place will please everyone.  Tight seating makes meeting your neighbors a must which was fun.  The penny covered bar top was neato.  :) drink options: many!  price point: so cheap, seriously.  We had the meat & cheese plate and couldn't tear ourselves away.  You know you've meaning to check this place out... don't wait another day!
