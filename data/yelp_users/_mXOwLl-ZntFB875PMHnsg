I just moved into town from CA and was eager to find my favorite neighborhood taco shop. There are several within walking distance. Lulu's is my first attempt. This ain't it.  I got a mix carne assada burrito with a side of rice & beans. The burrito was almost flat...almost nothing inside. The beans  in the to go carton were half filled. I'm still hungry and I got the friggin special! What little meat I did get tasted good enough but the portions were scarce. Very skimpy for the price. And I was the only one there so it wasn't because they were busy.... Now I know why no one else was there. I won't be going back

I was pretty underwhelmed with the experience... The rooms were clean and unique and the staff were helpful.  Parking was a disaster.  It's pretty far from the room and there's no ramp or elevator if you are transporting luggage.  I'm sure the valet experience is much nicer but I was planning on being in an out several times in the day and wanted easier access to my car.  All the rooms surround the pool area and they played the poolside music all night long right  outside my room.  It was going at 11:30 pm when I went to bed and still going at 5:45 when I woke up. And the pool is just OK... nothing spectacular

Great BBQ, although not a huge fan of the cafeteria style ordering. I have been twice, I got the brisket sandwich one time and ribs the next. Both were delicious. I added  bbq sauce to the ribs because I thought they needed it. Try the homemade root beer at least once, too. YUM. We got there just in time ( a bit before 6 on a Friday night)  as we were leaving the line was 3x as long...out the door and around the corner.  Oh FYI...for sides I got the beans (loved them) and my kids said the macaroni and cheese was good. Dad wasn't impressed with the coleslaw.

I agree. Great pizza, so-so service (for dine-in).  This is the best NY style pizza I've had outside of NYC. I love it so much, this is the only place in town I'll go to get pizza. Fortunately the kids like it too. I can order their XXL and feed the whole gang (4 kids) under $20.  But for convenience sake, I almost always order take-out.   I've dined in twice and never had a poor experience but they don't dote on you here. You'll get your food and it will taste awesome. If you need them to coddle you and check on you every 5 min this isn't the place to dine. They're New Yorkers, so they expect you to order, eat and pay. You got a problem with that? I don't  The prices are fair. The food is above par.   Fahggetaboutit!!!

The food was fresh and flavorful. The service was attentive and eager.  I will definitely go back and bring the family next time. This is my new go-to place for Mediterranean food. Best place I've found in the valley.

Used these cupcakes as client gifts. The manager packed each one up individually in nice little boxes. I even tried one!  I loved it and was impressed with the customer service and creativity of this place. And they took my AMX! Many small places like this don't.

Meh... Just really watery martinis and poorly constructed sushi. Having paid an astronomical amount for very little food I left feeling guilty & ashamed that I let the hip veneer and cool vibe draw me in.   I live nearby and am disappointed that I don't have a stellar sushi spot in my neighborhood.

Exactly what you want in a local coffee shop...friendly, fresh and good. I plan to return some Sat eve when they say they have entertainment.

As much as I want to like this place the last couple of times I've been there the coffee has ended up tasting like cardboard so I had to update my review. I can make a better cup at home. I still like the location and the staff friendliness, just not the coffee.

Something's going downhill with Rubios. Firstly, the food: their quacamole is nasty. I've been coming to Rubios for over a decade and I've never noticed anything wrong with the guac, but I got a bowl this time and the guac was separated... just foul tasting. Next, the service: As our food was delivered to us the worker asked if there was anything else she could get us. We were seated outside and so I asked for a fork. She told me I could go get it up by the Salsa bar. Why ask me if you know quite well that you're not going to get me anything? I'd rather they just call out a number like other fast food restaurants and I can go get the order and everything else I need. But if they're going to make a play of service and actually bring me the food like they do, would it kill them to bring napkins and a fork too? Otherwise I still have to get up and walk all the way to the front. Their bringing food and nothing else to me does me no good. If you ask me for "anything else," be prepared to follow through or don't ask the question.

Pulling in and we were directed to a new lane opening up. But we ended up waiting for a half an hour in this new line. Horribly managed place. Apparently their equipment broke down. We ended up missing the beginning of the movie with no apology from them.

What is it with thin, almost meatless burritos in this valley? Attending a meeting nearby I caught this place on a drive-by and decided to try it. I was thrilled to find an Al Pastor option! ...except when the burrito arrived I had to hunt and dig to find the Al Pastor. It was all tortilla and some sort of green veggie mixture.  I would love to say that the Al Pastor made up for it but I could barely taste any... The accompanying salsa was sweet... yuck!  You'd think a burrito place near the University would be a slam dunk, but I don't even think a strong case of the late night munchies would find this place even remotely satisfying. Bleh!

I wish we had a place like this in my hometown! AYCE...But good. They make the nigiri small, so you can order several and not fill up. They also let you order 1/2 specialty rolls... I tried some new things I'd never tried before and loved each one.  The service was quick and attentive even with a full house. I'll be back here on my regular business trips

Some reviews state that it's expensive, but I find the service here cheaper than the insurance plan that you can get with the phone. Two of my kids broke their screens within 2 weeks of each other and each time we brought them here they were repaired within an hour, each time under $100. Highly recommend.

A salad is like public television. Everyone knows they should and claims they do, but most people don't. I'm not a salad eater. I never order it, but I have eaten a few tasty salads in my day...mostly homemade by others. But this fast food salad spot popped up in my neighborhood and I decided to try it.  Today was my fourth visit and I was actually craving it. That's a good sign.  They've obviously worked out whatever service issues they've had because I've never waited more than a few seconds at the drive-through window to get my order.  The salad is delicious and filling and I'll be going back . This is a place I hope succeeds. I only wish they posted calorie info...it is supposed to be healthy after all.

Starting off with the chips and salsa, I loved both. The atmosphere is cool as others have mentioned. I found zero problem with the service. It was attentive and sufficient.   The drinks are the best thing. I had the Mexican Mule.   I liked my tacos.  I had a short rib and the pork (called something else to be hip). 2 were enough but they were a bit overpriced for the size. The place is an overall great addition to Gilbert.  UPDATE: From this 1st visit I had some coupons for more tacos and a drink - all FREE. I went back expecting for there to be an up-sell and OK with it.  My friend and I ordered our drinks with alcohol, which should have been extra, I think. At the end, my friend and I asked for the bill but we were told the coupons had taken care of everything. We walked out paying NOTHING (except we left a generous tip for the waitress, of course).   What a great way to do business! I'll be back to spend real money. No question.

Everyone who works in food service, retail or customer service should be required to frequent Dutch Bros on a regular basis. HR professionals should have to study their hiring practices. They are the platinum level. I've never had a poor experience at any location. This one is the newest location nearest to my home and it's just as good as any of the others. In fact I often go just for the pick-me-up and positive interaction that I know I'll get at the window.  And the coffee is delicious too!  If you order just a coffee, it's made as an Americano with espresso and hot water. DELICIOUS! Far more delicious and far better pricing than any other specialty coffee house. Most DB location are just drive-thru with some outside seating, so you wouldn't go to hang out in a cafe, but it's a far better experience and far better coffee than any of the other local cafes including the one who shall not be named..."S*****cks.

Loving this place! Nice small bit authentic setting. My test of a good sushi place starts with whether or not they shout "irashaimasen!"  when you walk in! They did.. Had spicy tuna and rainbow roll. Both satisfying.

Ordered on my phone! Great food and very reasonable prices and it's conveniently close to home. Hope this neighborhood spot stays.
