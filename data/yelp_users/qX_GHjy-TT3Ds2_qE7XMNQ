I just felt that the calamari was bland.  The roast beef sandwich was too fatty and the au jus was too salty.  Tirimisu was deliscious though.

I enjoy their food and beer.  Everything is from scratch and was super delicious.  I had Bistro Steak Medallians that were cooked perfectly to order.  The menu had so many different options it makes choosing between dishes difficult but the staff is very helpful.  The Happy Hour they have is awesome and it is all day on Sunday!
