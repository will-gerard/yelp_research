How is this place getting all these positive reviews??  My guess is they're trolling cause the food is terrible - not fresh, tastes old and frozen, even the water tasted disgusting.    Avoid at all costs there are so many better Chinese restaurants in the area to spend your money at.

If ever in the chandler area and sushi is on your mind, shimogamo is best in town.    Although it's in a strip mall the service is awesome, sushi chefs are amazing, seafood is always fresh, and although small, the place is all class.

It's no wonder why olive garden and company are declining.   We sat at the bar and didn't get any service for over 10 minutes.   Open boxes, dirty dishes, empty cups lined the bar like a college kitchen.   Not a good experience we ended up walking out and ate at Abuelos next door.

Good on the usual suspects but other than that don't get too crazy on the others.    Service not good

This place is a hidden gem.   From its baked goods to their filling sandwiches you cant go wrong.

Overrated.   Plus they are so full of it that they don't think they need a sign on Chandler Avenue.  And because if no sign I forget its tucked away in the corner.    Anyways been there twice in the last 6 months and not impressed - more of a novelty for me than anything.

Their cheesesteak is a must try of you are ever in the area.   Nothing fancy about the sandwich just a good soft roll, good cut of ribeye, and the perfect amount of cheese.

One star is an insult.   Worst pizza I've ever had - I would rather have 5 day old pizza left in my car than this.   How this place is still in business is beyond me.

I ordered the kingdom plate i think it's called for $25.   it came with 2 small kofta kebabs (which were made from lamb instead of lean beef as the menu stated, 2 small cubes of tasteless meat, 2 small cubes of chicken.  it also came with a salad and veggies.  the entire meal should have cost no more than $7.     needless to say i will not be visiting that establishment anytime soon.

One of the best watering holes in chandler with an awesome beer selection.   Food has gotten much much better.   This review has been edited and years back i rated the food as just blah.   It has made a complete 180 and if you were initially turned off by the food before, give it another try.

Management: more hefs on tap for my wife, a bigger establishment (the vacant spot near behind the mask maybe?), and better outdoor eating area/patio.   Please.

If i could give zero stars i would.    calling what i ate a pizza would be an insult to pizza.    hands down worst pizza i've ever had.

Worst customer service I've ever dealt with.  My upgrade was available and I wanted to switch to the iPhone 4s.   He told me that not only is it on back order for two weeks but the apple store in the mall was flat out also and I had no reason to check there.   I not only got my phone at the apple store but they had no shortage of phones.

The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of their slow service.   Other than that the meat pie appetizer tasted just like mom used to make, chicken curry and homemade rotis, and the curry tofu rice and bean plate we're delicious and fresh.   I'll be looking forward to next weeks visit.

Great little unassuming place in what looks like a courtyard of a home.    Food was excellent, service very friendly

I've been to about every pizza parlor in town and for me, Spinato's has the best pizza in town.    Nice thin crisp crust, a sweet sauce which i prefer, great tasting pepperoni, cold cold beer, and very friendly staff.

Love everything about this northern Chinese fare.   Looks like a hole in the wall but don't be fooled - hand stretch noodles, fresh dumplings and pastry/dough dishes, and amazing non traditional dishes you'll want to come back to try the entire menu

The curtains are held up by PVC piping that should say it all.    I went there for lunch - place was 10 percent occupied and still took 1 hour for food to come.   On top of that food was piss poor - I ordered the pork dish - tasted and looked like old frozen pork that was nuked.   Never going back

Before coming here we had gone over to Copper Kettle only to find the entire restaurant closed for a private party.   I yelped the nearest Indian and Kabob n Kurry had decent ratings and fairly close to where we were.      We ordered the vegetable qourma, chicken tikka masala, garlic naan, samosa's, and mango lassie.    The vegetable qourma was a mixed back of frozen vegetables that was to put it mildy disgusting.   Chicken tikka was actually not bad - however more sauce that chicken.   And the chicken pieces were small I felt like I had to fish into the bowl to find them.   Garlic naan was weak - too thick, had the consistency of a focaccia bread.   Lassie was actually pretty good.   Samosa i think were frozen bought also - very thin and fried to so hard it was tough to even cut w/ a knife and fork.  Staff consisted of young girl and an older women who claimed she ran the place.   Young girl was very inexperienced, never came back to refill our waters, and forgot our samosas (there were two other tables w/ guests!).   Manager was more involved in checking herself out in the glass window and texting on her phone; though she did ask us how we were doing it was not very genuine.  I'd recommend elsewhere for Indian food.

I've lived in se Asia for 20 years, some of that in Thailand and have tried most the thai spots that Arizona had to offer.   Hands down this thai basil is the best and very authentic.

This little garage is owned by two brothers, George and Cesar and I've been using them for the last 7+ years and even got my friends hooked on them as well.   Not only are they honest about their work but typically their charges are up to half of what everyone else charges.     For a small fee they'll even come get your car for you.

Our ac went out today Memorial Day and with my wife pregnant 28 weeks, sensible air was a life saver.   Larry was our tech, he was friendly, and he knew exactly why our ac was blowing hot air.   Two hours later he fixed the problem and tonight we sleep comfortably.   Our home warranty uses this company - I recommend them they know what they're doing.

Good food good beer and I would probably give this place a 4 or 5 if it wasn't for the crappy (crappy being an understatement) service on the rooftop bar.   Our server was as rude you can imagine and enough so that we just don't go there altogether.  Unfortunate but there are other better spots plus I would rather spend my money where it's appreciated.

Michael, Leslie, Kristin, and Todd are whom I dealt w/ at Velocity Financial w/ our refi.   All of them are experts in their field, know how to make a deal work, and just always very on top of your loan when it comes to what's required from the lender.     We're very happy with our end result and wouldn't hesitate to recommend family and friends to them.  Thanks again guys!  Nick.

Burgers are excellent.  They even have a shrimp burger which is awesome.   Only drawback for me are two simple fixes: a) it's too damn cold, especially for my 5 month year old, and b) sauce bar is cool but no trays to carry them on.

I've been wanting to try this place since it opened and did not disappointment.   Rustic homemade bread for their sandwiches, gourmet salads, and more.   Look forward coming back to try the rest of the menu.

I've been wanting to come here for quite a while now since it's right down the road and it did not disappoint.   Chicken is pretty darn good and enough to peak my curiousity on their other chicken items.   Warning: The spicy is very spicy and I love spicy food but will go mild next time.   Ordering times are about 15-20 minutes because food is fresh and made to order so next time will call ahead.    Price is between $9-$15 for half and whole chickens which is very fair - I ordered the half and it's good for two people easy.  My only advice is because they're not allowed a sign on the street, they need more than a flag, maybe a guy in a crazy chicken costume or something.   Chino bandito's was in this location and I completely forget they were even in there which, aside from being overrated, was I'm sure their downfall.

Visited Bella Gusto for lunch today for the first time and had their Phoenix Salad and Meatball Panini.   Everything was delicious - bread was rustic homemade, mozzarella is homemade.   Would definitely go back and try their other items.

Went there for the first time today to sample their $1 Taco Tuesday deals.   Best street tacos in Chandler w/o a doubt - flavorful and spicy.  I look forward coming back and sampling their bowls, rice and beans, and tortas which was recommended.
