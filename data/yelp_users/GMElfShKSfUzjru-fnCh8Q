Holy Cow! This place is such a hidden gem, and I'm just glad we found it! To start things off the service and general level of Care that is present in this place is enough to earn them 5 stars, then when you add in the quality and level of excellence that their food offers... Well done deal this place rocks.  The sea bass is out of this world and just about everything else is as well.  5 STARS YELPER's. Check this place out. The owners who actually run the business will probably go over and introduce themselves. And they're just as great as this place is.

Really enjoy this place. Drinks are good, food is always quick and tastes great.   Usually go with a group of 5-6 and never really have an issue getting a table, unless it's a big event like a fight.   Head over its a good time.

Thursday through Saturday karaoke is always a great time! Drinks are a decent price and it's never too crowded. Saturday nights are obviously the busiest and can be a lot of fun! Open to anyone from the tone deaf to the next winner of American idol.   Service can be a bit lagged but that's not why we come here.

Pizza is great! Definitely a high quality and the cheese is delicious! Wings are amaaazing!!! Pretty quick and price isn't too bad! Service isn't the most amazing, but it seems to be a pretty simple place with no bells and whistles.

These guys saved the day AND saved me a ton of $$$ money.  I broke my car key in my ignition and after fishing the key out I called these guys and they told me to bring it over.   After less than 5 minutes the gentleman working was able to make a new key and told me to come back if there was any issues. As well gave me referrals to someone if the issue persisted.  Luckily after taking the key to my car it worked perfectly!!!  5 stars!!! Thanks again

This is by far my favorite movie theater.   We head here Atleast once a week as a group of 6 and it's always a good time.   Food is great, drinks; although a bit pricey (if not on happy hour), always made well and Come on, watching a new movie while eating a burger and well drink- can't ask for more.   Also always a groupon for a $5 ticket!!  5 STARS Yelpers!

Ordered delivery today and the food came extremely undercooked and cold.  Very disappointed with the food I received and it cost me 27 bucks! Would definitely like a refund because the meal was definitely below par.  Will not be returning to this place or be ordering from here again.

This place is awesome! Every single time I come here the service is great the girls are friendly the drinks were delicious and the service is quick and speedy!  The price compares well to places like Starbucks and Dutch Bros and in my opinion tastes way better!!  Super excited for these guys to One day start spreading across town, because when that day comes I will officially stop drinking Starbucks.   Check this place out Yelpers 5 STARS!!

Awesome environment. Staff is friendly, and the place is pet friendly as well.   Fun place to watch a game or just get a few drinks.   Food is good and service is pretty quick.   If you haven't made it out to this place yet, definitely worth checking it out.
