Place was awesome, amazing shawarma and they had this garlic sauce that was amazing. This place is also a grocery stores, those are usually the best.

Always a good time coming here, great customer service.   They were able to do my huge, thick comforter and my couch covers.   They look, feel and smell like new. Also, not that expensive.

This is a place where they have peanuts at the tables and there is just peanuts shells on the ground. Just FYI to help understand the ambience.   Food was really good I must say. We have the El Jefe wings boneless. When it came, we were disappointed because it looked like a dry rub but man but it pack in some flavor. I would def. recommend that if this is your first time here.

This place is not keen on customer service. When you walk in, it has the feel that the only people in there are the people that come in everyday. Everything is pretty standard as it relates to a sports-bar. Food was not bad not nothing special either. The service was slow, didn't know if they had a server for my area or even if they had areas. I have to walk up to the bar to ask for the check after waiting and my plate and beer were cleaned up. I was only asked for a drink once with no refills on the water.

This place is not a sit down place. It's a place where you get a slice or slices of pizza on a paper plate. Just FYI.   I went to this place because they have a low-carb pizza, only 10 net grams of carbs they say. So I tried that it was pretty good, very thin but very good. Also the price is pretty good too.

This place was AWESOME, wow I was impressed.   I came here because I say the yelp reviews (700+) and I was in the neighborhood which is on the WAY east side. The inside is super unique and cool. This is a semi-fast kind of joint, order at the window but boy is it worth it.   I had the Fontina Burger, and is was phenomenal!!! Every bite made my salivary glands kick into action. I had a similar feeling when eating at DMK in Chicago. (not comparing to DMK but similar feeling). I would def recommend this place and a place to show people.   Enjoy.

Pretty cool place, some reviews say this is a sports bar. They have a lot of TV's but the audio wont be turned on if you like that or expect that for big games.   There beer selection is HUGE, which is always nice.   Service is really good as well, there was a private party and they were able to find us a table so we could watch the game and they are really friendly.   Food is good for sports bar food, the quesadillas were really good.

This place has is soo unique and the food is awesome. The inside has cool painting of the areas representing the food. From the inside you are tell this is a small shop, but those are usually the best.   I had the Chicken Roti and it was soo good. It was chicken curry on bread and finished it all. My friend ordered the Jerk Chicken and that was perfect as well.

Really cool spot, this is located in a casino and it does not take reservations.   When it opens, there is a line that forms and it is first come first serve. If you have flexible on that, the food is amazing, if you are sitting in stool area, they cook in front of you. This is a unique date area and just something fun to do that is outside the norm.

Place has a very laid back atmosphere where everyone is friendly and knows you. I came in because of the yelp reviews and it is right by my house. I was not disappointed. I had Darrell cut my hair and he took his time and you can tell that he wants you to look perfect. Also he did my beard right too.   Men's haircuts are 20 with a hot towel and massage, you can't really that with the personal touch they have here. The beard was extra but as it is at most other places.

New place, very good.   Food was really good, their Happy Hour prices were also very appealing.   I tried the Biryani which was very tasty and just the right amount of spicy.   I have also tried their masala dosa which was perfect. Usually with Indian places that have both North Indian and South Indian food you usually have to settle for one. They have a 2 chefs, one that does the North Indian dish and the other one does the South

Meat was amazing and the concept was different. You should get the plate and have the lamb meat, soooo good.

This place is Indo-Chinese. Very nice d√©cor, cool atmosphere.    If you like Indian, Thai or Chinese food you will probably like this place. The food has a lot of flavor and spice to it. If you are Indian, this is like little India inside with all the clientele, so a great place to take your Indian parent who are SUPER picky.   One note, their apps are better than their entrees. I think they do dry currys the best but with wet currys they are not as good.

Really cool place, their menu changes all the time and they have it like a different episode of a season and they change season every year. Very cool concept, this place is a place if you are trying to impress.

Amazing food, pretty impressed.   This place to hard to find at first, it is by Oregano's  and Rag-o-rama.   The food was on point, I ordered the short ribs, that is def a must here. Meat was perfect, spice was perfect.

Place is pretty awesome. They are opened late and it always a good call for post-party drunk food. Pizzas are pretty huge so keep that in mind when ordering.

Had high hopes for this one.   They had tandoori check pizza and Indian options. They pizza was ok, the toppings fell short from 1 inch from the crust and the wings weren't any better.

What a surprise. We had friends in town and wanted to show them something cool in Phoenix. We decided to go here. One thing to note, you have to walk through an alley to get to the door but it is for sure worth it. We get inside, get some drinks, pretty reasonably priced I might add. We sit down, chatting and then I thought of exploring the whole venue which we all thought was just a small room. I turn the corner and there are more tables, ski ball, pool table and couches. So there was a whole other portion to take part in and as I walked further I could hear live music, there was a whole other room that was a concert venue playing soul music. It was an AWESOME night with chill people.   CHECK OUT THIS PLACE
