The thai food here is pretty good. I have always ordered take out so I cannot comment on the service, however, i have never had to wait and the people there are very nice. The red curry is yummy!

Went to ER for vomiting, got in quickly but I felt like they wanted to give me anything and everything that I did not need including pain meds.  I have been requesting an itemized bill and copy of my medical records for over a month and have not recieved anything after calling and speaking to someone or leaving messages three times.  I would highly recommend anyone seen at any hospital to request an itemized bill and copy of their medical records.  Unfortunetly theese days sometimes you are your own best advocate.

Everything was okay here accept the terrible customer service.  I had to rent a tux for my boyfriend for my mothers wedding.  When I called to get a price they told me that I needed to place my order at least two weeks ahead in order to ensure that it arrived on time, so we went down that day and ordered.   Two weeks had passed and I called to make sure that it had arrived which they replied that it had not.  I was not too worried at this point because we still had a week before the wedding. I continued calling thought the week before the day that were scheduled to leave had come and we still had no tux.  When I called that day she said that the deliveries had not come yet and that they would call them to see if they had and call me back.  Well they never called me back so we drove down there.  As we arrived they looked nervous to see us but took us to the back room to try on the tux that we ordered because apparently it had come (but why did she not call me back?) My boyfriend barely squeezed into this tux.  It was tight around the neck and when he knelt down it felt and looked like it was going to split.   When we voiced our concerns to the woman working there (she is the owner), she got this snotty attitude and acted like we were absolutely ridiculous for wanting a tux that fit comfortably.  When my boyfriend showed her how tight it was when he knelt down she replied,  "Well I don't know why you would be doing that at a wedding so....". My boyfriend told her, "Well what if I'm dancing and want to move around a little?" And she responded, in the snottiest way possible"I don't know anybody who dances like that." I suspect that they took one of the tuxedos off the mannequins and tried to pass it off as the one we ordered.  Especially when they had to send us to another store to pick up a vest that they did not have in the color we wanted.   We ended up using it for the wedding because we did not have another option at this point. I would have given this place a better rating if it wasn't for the woman who "helped" us.  She was rude, snotty, and she simply did not care.  I have never been treated so poorly anywhere in my life.

Really good food! Like Filibertos but way better.  People are always friendly.  Tried the rolled tacos and machaca breakfest burrito like them both.

I have always avoided dying my hair brown because the 4 times that I did it always came out too dark, I looked washed out, or I simply just didn't like it.  I eventually just accepted the fact that I only looked good as a blonde.  However, I get bored easily and really wanted something different.  So I decided to give it a go one more time.    I found Deana on yelp and I would HIGHLY recommend her.   She has all the good qualities of a hair professional.    1. She listens to what you like, what you don't like, and asks questions. 2.She must have payed attention in beauty school because she is knowledgeable while having an artistic eye. 3. She is honest. 3. She is reasonably priced.   I will definitely be returning to Deana because not only am I completely satisfied with my hair but I am actually in love with the idea that I can finally feel good as a brunette.  I never thought it was possible!  Deana is exceptional!!

This post office is terrible.  I have had 3 packages that were not delivered.  When I call to investigate they are rude.  They tell my that they will look into the matter and call me back and of course they do not.  Moving soon and glad that I dont have to put up with these people anymore.  There is def something shady going on at this location.
