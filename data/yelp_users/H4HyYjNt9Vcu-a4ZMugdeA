The food is just ok... A little over priced compared to what you get. WIll choose a better steakhouse, at the same price point, before coming here again... very disappointed in quality, portion size, and price point.

Stay away! They only have ONE photographer that does everything. U have to come back just to pick out your pictures that you just took. We had to wait an hour just to pick our pictures and pay for them. They book everyone every 20 mins. That's time for the pictures, to have them pick out the pictures, and pay for it. I paid $200 in pictures to get that treatment. Not run well at all!!! No one at Target can help u either. The photographer did well but they need way more staff to check people in and out etc. Beware they close an hour for lunch. Make sure not to come back then for your pictures. Just wasted my time driving over to find they just closed for an hour lunch 5 mins before and no way to pick up my pictures. I don't live close by either. I will not be back after I get my pictures from them. I give the photographer 4 stars and the actual photo studio 0-1 star!! They are lucky to get two stars.

This a great Antique store. The prices are a little high, that's why I only gave 4 stars. Has a wide variety and stuff changes out every 5-6 months or so. This place is one of our favorites to go to!

I arrived at the studio for the facial I had. I was greeted by Virgina with a warm smile. We went back to the Estitician room and she went to work on my face! I chose to get Micro and an Oxygen facial. It was so great!! It was so relaxing with the music and the lighting. I could easily drift away. Before I knew it my time was done! She did an amazing job. She recommended me products for my skin time! She was very personable and she knows what she's doing! Terrific service and a wonderful experience! I can't wait to go back! Very reasonable prices also!!! My face loves it :)

We just had a birthday party for my daughter at this location. It was so bad! If I could have given zero stars, I would have. The party host was always no where to be found. One time we where looking for her and she was washing the windows..???!! We had to do pretty much everything for ourselves. It was the biggest waste of money for a birthday party!!! No one cared. Every time we asked for our host, no one knew where she was or told us to talk to someone else. I was ready to talk to the manager but I didn't want a scene in front of the kids! Will not do that again! I had guests helping to serve the other party guests, it was so bad!

Service looks like has gone way down from when first opened. Not worth the prices for how you get treated!!

We just got done having a stay-cation here for Memorial Day weekend. My husband and I where very disappointed with our stay!! When he booked it two months ago and we wanted to move the dates, they told him it was non refundable. We didn't book with any deals or special pricing so why wouldn't we be able to change it?They didn't even tell him that when he booked it.  We decided to go anyways because we would have lost over $600 for two nights if we didn't show up. THat's ridiculous!! I called for room service, they didn't sound so pleasant, in the least. To Valet it's $27 a day and to even self park it's $10 a day! The wait at Prado was over an 1 1/2 hours to get our food, when we got it it was still under cooked. There was a wait for everything. We stopped in to check out Joya spa and the front desk seemed very put out that we wanted to check it out before booking a VERY pricy service.WE decided against it because of the impression we got from the front desk.  It always seemed like you where putting out the staff everywhere we went. They charge for everything!!!! It seems like they are hurting for money to not even let you change the dates or cancel 2 months in advance then get treated like you are putting people out. This use to be my favorite place to stay-cation but not anymore. I will go elsewhere, where we are more appreciated!

I have to say, I've been here about 4-5 times and I honestly haven't been to impressed with the service... I felt like I had to keep tracking down the servers and also I felt like we where always putting them out....???  The food was pretty good... Kinda pricey but not to bad.. I was very disappointed about the orange juice. I was charged $4 for a "fresh squeezed" orange juice and when I got it, it tasted just like from a carton. I asked the waitress, when she finally came around and she said, it is fresh squeezed, we just order it in and it comes in a jug...??? SO that too me is not fresh squeezed and not worth $4 a glass. The french toast isn't bad. They have pretty good happy hour pricing! I just felt like it was nothing special compared to anyone else. Kinda disappointing  cause I was really excited when they went in...

My husband and I have been going to Vibetality for 7 months now. In that time we have experienced many different things! -The owners are honestly wonderful, caring, and willing to help you with postures after class, they listen to suggestions,etc -The studio is clean, relaxing, peaceful, and fun. I love the plants that are in the yoga room!!  -The workouts are amazing!!!! I can't believe it actually works. We both feel it for a couple days after!!! They have a variety of classes for all levels and offer different types. I personally love the vibe classes the best!!!!  -I've never used the float tank but I hear that people love it. It looks great!  -They offer a wide variety of vitamins, drinks, etc and help offer suggestions.  All in all I waited this long to write this because I wanted the FULL experience. I'm so glad we bought the try me package. I'm very pleasantly surprised!!! They really know what they are doing here. Believe me, I'm picky!!! Lol :)  I actually look forward to working out!!

7 mins before they where closing and the open sign still lit, we where walking up to go buy some gelato. One of the workers locked the door right before we could open it, and walked off. We wont be back! That's bad service!!!

I love Angry Crab Shack.They have the best shrimp and snow crab:) The service is the best and the workers are really friendly!!!!!! I would recommend this place for people who love seafood. You can get really messy when you eat the food,so they give you cute crab bibs.

Just had dinner here. Our Server was Amanda D. We got the tacos. They are about 3-4 bits but surprisingly filling and yummy. We also got the guacamole which was really good. We had no wait and our service was fantastic!!! We always had drinks and Amanda kept checking on us. Now that is service!! I'm happy we tried this place !!  We will be back!
