We went for Adults' Night Out. They have it every First Friday from 5:30-9. It's free and there are no kids. Woo hoo! It was fun getting to play with everything without having to be the nice mature adult and let the kids at it first. Unfortunately, I didn't get to try this out when there was alcohol and apps, but we still had a great time. The weather area was pretty cool and they have a Lego play area right now for that small exhibit . The dancing metal shavings were awesome. I want one of those things! The lecture is free, but the planetarium is not.  There's a light rail stop a couple of blocks west of the Science Center if your riding t west if you don't want to drive here and look for parking.

The Desert Botanical Gardens are beautiful. I'm just amazed by all of the different types of cati that are on display here. It's a great way to get some exercise and enjoy the beautiful desert plants. They are blooming right now and the gardens look amazing.   We came to see the Chihuly exhibit yesterday (with some free passes, woo hoo!) just before sunset. You have to see this during the day and at night. Some pieces look better during the day and others look better at night. I would suggest going to see this exhibit during the week. It was pretty busy on a Tuesday night, so I can't imagine how busy they are on the weekend.   If you're into desert plants, Boyce Thompson Arboretum is another great place to check out near Globe.   Some of the trails close at sunset, so get here before the sun goes down to check them out. And the butterfly exhibit closes at 5pm. Also they are now open until 9pm.

I love the Phoenix zoo. So I grew up in south Phoenix and this was our go to field trip in elementary school.   Seriously, we went every year.   But I was ok with that because I loved it. I've enjoyed picnics (the way too go, the food is not that great and it's expensive), birthday parties, and scavenger hunts here. I even saw a wedding here once. On a nice day it makes for a great walk. Too bad they didn't have the water park type area when I was a kid. It looks so refreshing to splash in during the summer when the afternoons can be unbearable. Trust me, I've thought about shoving a kid or too out of the way just to enjoy a sprinkle.    It's also nice to come here in December when it's a little chilly and grab a cup of hot chocolate and enjoy Zoo Lights.

Great place for Happy Hour! The downstairs bar is very dim and the ambiance with the copper bar and fireplace is so cozy. It gets a little warm if you are sitting at the bar across from the fireplace, but this is also probably the brightest spot in the room so you can actually read the menu.  :p   I had the house Chardonnay and bf had the house cab for $5. We tried the tenderloin toasts, beef skewers, carne tacos, and bacon wrapped scallops and they were all good. I enjoyed a couple of the dipping sauces that came with the scallops and skewers (the same 4 sauces came with both) and the 5 different toppings on the small tacos.   We were stuffed when we left. We will definitely be back.

Happy Hour now starts an hour earlier from 3-6 pm.   Don't try the stuffed mushrooms, they were really salty. They have a pretty good creme brulee too.   Still love the food and the atmosphere of the downstairs bar.   When we walked out I noticed that they have a dinner special for 2 written on the chalk board just before you walk into the restaurant. You each get to choose a cut of beef (I think there were about 4-5 to chose from), a salad, and a side (about 4-5 to choose from also) for $36. Sounds like a great deal. We'll have to come back and try it out.

I decided to start celebrating my birthday a night early so we came to Postino's to take advantage of their Tuesday night special. The parking lot was packed so we opted to valet which was only $3. We got here at 7:30 and although they quoted us about a 25 minute wait, we only waited about 15 minutes.   The outside patio is pretty cute with the lights and bushes and they have heaters to keep you warm on a chilly night.   You can choose ANY bottle on their menu and get a board of bruschetta for $20. We went with a bottle of a California Cab (delicious, I almost drank the whole bottle myself), a board of bruschetta, and the nine iron panini. Mike is a pretty picky eater, but I thought I was going to have to fight him for one of the pieces of prosciutto with figs & mascarpone he liked it so much. I love getting him to try new things and even more so when he actually likes them. The smoked salmon with pesto and warm artichoke pieces were also delish. The nine iron was also very tasty. The bacon and mozzarella were definitely the stars of this dish. The mozzarella just melted in your mouth.   The staff here was so friendly. Our water glasses were never empty and someone was always checking in on us. I was also walked to the bathroom when I asked where it was.  Thanks for making our first visit so great!

I love Poncho's. I grew up in South Phoenix so my family and I came here all the time when I was a kid and I continue to make the drive back here years later and always bring new friends to try the place out. My favorite dish is the Pollo Fundido. It's so good. The salsa in a squeeze bottle is kinda weird, but good.   Be sure to check out the room with a mural of ex-Pres. Clinton sitting at the end of your table. And the secret service standing on the opposite wall.

I love the cheese assortment at Trader Joe's. I love trying new stuff here. I just picked up some cheese, ham, peach salsa, spicy hummus and pasta. Doesn't that sound like a yummy meal?  :p  It drives me nuts how busy this place is. I would love to come here just once and have this place to myself.  And I would come here more often if there was another location closer to east Mesa.

I came here to get re-sized. I had a young girl help me out and she measured me and after doing her fancy shmancy bra math she came to the conclusion that I was an A cup. Errr. Wrong. I couldn't get both cups in an A cup bra to cover one of my boobs. I laugh and inform her that she is mistaken and to try again. I even told her what I was and now what I think I am. She proceeds to argue with me as if I have no knowledge about boobs. I wanted to tell her that I have about 10 years more boob experience than she does, but I felt like I was getting nowhere.   Finally, she grew a brain and asked her manager to help her. The manager came over and before she even measured me she told me what size she thought I was (from just a glance) and she was spot on.   I bought a couple of bras, but never again will I ask them for size help. Maybe if they put them through some type of boob training course, but I'd have to see the diplomas on the wall.

I've eaten here multiple times against my will because my ex loved the place. It's ok. Kind of quiet and boring atmosphere for a Mexican food place. I'd say to try Macayo's or On the Border for better Mexican chain food.   Who are you going to believe me or all the one review orange heads?  :p

Although Home Depot isn't as pretty as Lowe's, we can always find what we are looking for or a pleasant person who can help us find it and properly advise us on how to use it. I love that if we are looking for something, but can't find it we can actually find a person working there willing to help us. And they don't just tell us, "Yeah, it's in aisle....," they will take the time to walk us to that aisle and find the item. Great customer service.   Thanks for all of your help!

Don't be scared away from the location. I've only been here at night, but the area looks deserted.   The sushi here is so fresh and good. I completely agree with another poster who said it just melts in your mouth. And let the chef be creative and make something off the menu for you. You can't go wrong. I haven't tried anything here that I didn't like. I also think it's a bit pricey, but worth it if you're looking to splurge on the good stuff. I love funky/industrial design of the curtains in the backroom.   I must add that I've been lucky enough to never have had to pay for a meal here.  :)

I've eaten at this location twice and have enjoyed both visits. I've had the prime rib which was cooked to perfection and a sirloin with lobster and shrimp special. The lobster and shrimp where in a sauce that was a little too salty. The crowd here is generally in the late 40's+ so don't expect a cool hip vibe from this place. It's quiet and dark with a lot of warm colors, which I like for a steak place. The service has always bene excellent. The waiters are attentive but not intrusive.   We signed up to receive a free dinner on our birthdays and I got the voucher for a free prime rib dinner with a potato and salad to be used Monday - Thursday anytime during the month of my birthday, yesterday. Woo hoo!

I love Liberty Market. I grew up in Gilbert and remember when this was a small grocery store. I've been wanting to check this place out since the conversion and I'm so glad I finally stopped by.   It was perfect. This place just feels like home. Casual, but warm. When we walked in my friend and I were lost and didn't know where to start. Luckily one of the staff quickly handed us menus and told us where to order.   I had a couple of caramel iced lattes and the Liberty Bowl. I loved both. The Liberty Bowl came with 4 big meatballs in marinara sauce and and two slices of toasted bread. It was so hard narrowing down my choice because there were so many delicious looking items on the menu and the baked goods display kept calling my name, but I resisted. Next time I think I'll just give in and have a slice of red velvet or carrot cake, or a cup cake or a slice of zucchini bread or a sticky bun. So much to choose from. I would love to come back here and have a coffee and sit and enjoy the atmosphere at the espresso bar.   Loved all the different themes in the bathroom stalls. You have to check each one out. Joe was there and stopped by each table to see how everyone was doing. We spent so much time here chatting and catching up. It's a great place to come and hang out. I will be back soon.

Came here for AZ Restaurant Week. This place was completely packed on a Tuesday night, but we'd made reservations ahead of time so we were immediately seated. This place is dimly lit, but not to the extreme where you cannot read the menu without your server pulling out a pen light. That's annoying so things were already off to a great start.   Everything was delicious. I loved the sun-dried tomato butter that came with the bread. We had very generous servings of the french onion soup. It's the best I've had. It was very flavorful. We ordered the lamb and the fillet Mignon. Both were pretty good. I'm not sure what to think of the mint sauce that came with the lamb. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it either. We ended off the night stuffing ourselves with a creme brulee and chocolate mousse. We find it hard to say no to dessert.   The service was great. Our glasses of water and wine were never empty and our courses were fairly well timed.   I hear they have a great happy hour and I liked the bar area so we will certainty be back for drinks.

The chocolate lava cake alone gets this place 4 stars. You place your order for it at the beginning of you meal because it takes quite some time to bake.   There is a cute little lake/pond that you can get a window seat next to and watch the ducks.   They print out their menu daily (maybe twice a day, I can't remember). My boyfriend loves the fillet here and I've had the sea bass and it was delicious. They also have a very nice salad bar where you can add your own ingredients to the salad and try some of their cold pastas. Our waiter was very attentive and made some great wine suggestions.   This place has an upscale atmosphere to it even though most people dress in resort casual wear. It would be a nice place to go for a romantic dinner.   *Sign up for their dining program. You get one point for every dollar you spend (not including taxes and tip) and my boyfriend said they accumulate toward free gift certificates.

Gross. This tastes nothing like Mexican food. Tastes like they heated up some Jose Ole in the micro. Never going back. I didn't even pay for this meal and I can't think of one good thing to say about this place.

After sampling their tasty roast beef and Gorgonzola mashed potatoes in a champagne glass at Yelp in Bloom I HAD to have this for lunch the next day. I woke up the following morning craving it and immediately looked up their menu online. I found the braised beef sandwich and called in my order. The quoted my 15 minutes, but I got there in less than 10 and it was ready. You can pick up call in orders at the first register when you walk right in. So convenient. They also have seating right outside on the sidewalk, but it's not covered so there isn't much shade around during the lunch hour.   It was everything I remembered. Whoever thought of putting mashed potatoes in a sandwich was brilliant. The sandwich comes with roast beef with Gorgonzola mashed potatoes and you get a side of horseradish and au jus on the side. It also comes with sweet potato chips.   Well done, Wildflower. Well done. I was never much of a fan of yours before, but this one is a winner.

Horrible service. These guys are rude and unprofessional.   I had forgotten to write a review about this company, because the day I dealt with them was just bad overall, but was fortunately reminded this morning when I drove behind one of their trucks. The jerk was in the carpool lane holding up traffic (for at least 10 miles - truck #110), but wasn't carpooling.   The wait time was just over double what they quoted (I waited over an hour) and they didn't even call to tell me they would be late. Is it too much to ask for a courtesy call? Every other company I've dealt with has. Running late, fine, just call me and let me know so I don't think I've been abandoned. And I originally went with them because they quoted me the shortest wait time. Don't fall for this. They give you a short wait time, but didn't deliver. And I didn't even get a "Sorry, I was busy and running late."

This place was ok. I wasn't much of a fan of the atmosphere or the food. It was just all ok. The service was slow, but very friendly. The servings here are HUGE. You'll immediately recognize the regulars because they are the ones sharing one entrée. I ordered a pasta dish and they had to have emptied an entire box of linguine in the pot for my dish. And it came with two whole pieces of chicken breast. It was just too much food for one person. I wish instead of offering such large portions they would just give me a little less of something really good instead of a whole lot of something forgettable. The gourmet burger was pretty boring as well. But the onion rings were pretty good, plus!  I actually regretted not having just gone to Olive Garden instead. We won't be back.

Even though I haven't seen any rave reviews about this place my boyfriend and I decided to stop by for drinks on Monday night. Opened the door and the place was empty except for a couple sitting on the other end of the restaurant just lounging. We stood around for a bit and there was no hostess even though there was a hostess stand. We didn't know what to do so we eventually walked to the back which is where the bar was located. Someone eventually came out from the back and in a snotty manner said they closed at 6 so we left. We were here before 6 but there was no one to help us and their bright neon OPEN sign was on. Annoying. We drove by later and the sign was still on. Not coming back here.

What the heck happened to this event? Dos Gringos??? Chipotle? The first time I came was 9 years ago and it's completely changed. This place was packed. You had to wait in line for everything. And I don't get paying admission to get in and then paying admission to get into one of the drink special areas like the beer garden and then paying again to get drinks in those areas. And many places ran out of food before the sun went down and this was suppose to go on until 10pm.   Some of the best stuff was free. A free sample of pork and a free sample of cheese. The free cheese tent should have been placed next to the Robert Mondavi wine area.  That would have been much more convenient for me. I did enjoy the chocolate fondue from the Melting Pot because well, it's chocolate. I guess I'm lucky that I'll eat just about anything and came hungry. The people watching was the best part.

Ok, apparently I am one of the few people who doesn't find Family Circus creepy. But even if it did, it wouldn't stop me from coming here.   The portions here are big enough to share, especially if you stop by for an after dinner treat. And they have so many things to choose from and everything is so good. The atmosphere is bright and this place is usually loud and crowded. It's definitely worth a stop and it's in a great location in Old Town.   Perfect way to end the night after taking a stroll at the Scottsdale Art Walk on a Thursday night.

I found the staff here to be very friendly. One of my favorite things to do is just lounge around and drink a glass of wine. I love to try new stuff and our waitress was so helpful in making a great suggestion for me and my boyfriend on some flights. The wine book (Something this thick can't really be called a menu) is huge and entertaining. It's weird that so many of the tables were 'Reserved' even though this place was pretty dead, but they gave us a great small table in some comfortable chairs in a corner. I can't wait to come back.

We came here for Happy Hour Saturday night and had a great time. We sat next to a couple that had been coming for more than a decade, before it was at this location.   The huckleberry margarita for $5 was yummy. I had two! They also had quite a few $5 wines during HH, which we will have to try next time. For food we ordered the rotisserie flat bread and of course the chili verde pork which was sooooo good. I enjoyed ever bite I had with the buttery tortillas. It was a mistake ordering this as I have craved it several times since.   They have a large bar area and it seems most of the people who come here are regulars and so friendly. The complimentary beef jerky at the bar top is also good, but be warned it is dry.   I can't wait to come back and have some more chili verde pork!

Came by Saturday for drinks and we were informed that the Margarita recipe has changed. I don't remember anything being wrong with it, but apparently it has less lime juice, which my boyfriend thought was a plus, I liked it better before. And I I think they are stronger now. I had 2 last time before I got a buzz and this time I could only handle one. Which turned out well for me since I had agreed to pay the bill tonight beforehand.

I've only been to Martini Ranch on Sunday nights for METALHEAD!  Small cover charge, but you'll have a blast rocking out to the band. I was really drunk one time and using a speaker on the stage to help me with my balance and almost took it down with me.  :p  Ahh....good times.  They have a large patio area and also a dance club upstairs on the other side of the patio.

Love their pizza. They only serve thin crust but it's a nice soft dough with a crunchy crust. I've never sat in the dining room because they have a nice hi-top seating area in the bar. Less of a wait if you grab one of those and I actually like the atmosphere in the bar area better. It's a great place to stop for a bite before or after the free Art Walk on Thursday nights in Old Town.   Last time we were there they mentioned that they stoke their ovens (sounds kinky) from 4-5 pm daily, so nothing goes in the oven during that time.   They have specials on their wines on Tuesdays. I think they were half off.

I love Lon's!   My boyfriend and I came here during Restaurant week and had a wonderful experience. The grounds here are beautiful. You have to sit on the patio. We decided to come on Wednesday in order to enjoy Wine Wednesday. We sat at the bar for a tasting and the bartenders were so friendly and knowledgeable. Our table was ready before we were done with our tasting but the hostess was very courteous and said just to check in with her when we were ready.   For dinner we were seated outside about a half hour before sunset. We each ordered the short rib as a starter, which came with mashed sweet potatoes. It was fabulous. The meat was flavorful and tender and I am not a fan of sweet potatoes but I pretty much licked them off the plate. It was a great combination.   I had the shrimp open faced ravioli for dinner and my boyfriend had the free range chicken. My dish was the perfect portion. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the fava beans and crimini mushrooms were a perfect compliment. My boyfriend is the least adventurous person I know when it comes to food that's why he picked the chicken, but he was blow away by the tenderness and flavor it had.   We both had the chocolate truffle tort with minted berries. It tasted like a half cooked brownie and was so good. And was just enough to satisfy our sweet tooth.   This is the perfect place for a romantic dinner. We didn't feel rushed at all. We had to have spent about 2-2.5 hours here. Outstanding service. I've been wanting to come again and my birthday is just around the corner...  :)

The mac and cheese meal with chicken here is awesome. It has just a bit of a kick. I tried the chicken, artichoke, and mushroom stack last night for dinner and that's my new favorite. The chicken enchiladas are just ok. Be careful with the frozen margaritas here. They have more alcohol in them than the on the rocks version and will knock you on your ass if you're not careful.  They have fajitas for $10.99 on Tuesdays with half of margaritas with the purchase of a fajita platter.   And don't worry about finding parking here. They have free valet for paying  customers. Just make sure to get a validation stamp from the hostess before you leave.

I love Harlow's. It's nice to come back to to the ASU area and see that one of my old fave's is still around.   The Eggs Benedict are so good. I get them EVERY TIME. I have yet to try anything different here. And because I am such a loyal person, I can pretty much assure you that I will probably never try anything else.   It's pretty much always crowded so be prepared to wait. Not too long though. I think the longest I've ever waited is 15 minutes, which is reasonable. But you'll be served in no time after ordering.   I'm not a huge breakfast person and I currently live at least 20 miles from Harlow's, but will still come here from time to time to enjoy a great breakfast and great service.

The people that work here are always very friendly and helpful. It's a pretty small place, but they have a good selection of ASU stuff at decent prices. Great items always on sale. I got my dad a nice ASU Dad t-shirt for about $15 and a cute blouse for myself for 40% off.    2 hour free parking is available just north of this location in n open parking lot from 6 or 8 am - 6pm, I think Monday through Friday. Sorry, I've forgotten  the exact days and start time.   They also currently have stuff for the teams playing in the Insight Bowl.

Ok. My boyfriend has been trying to get me to come here for months. However, I am not a sandwich lover, so I've always refused to come with him for lunch. Once we actually pulled up here (I didn't know that this was where we were going) and parked and I made him leave. I'm usually not this difficult about food, but I like hot food and always think of sandwiches as cold. We went to Samurai Sam's instead that day and now I know what a huge mistake I made.   I tried Dilly's Deli for the first time yesterday and I loved it! I got half a Yahoo sandwich (roast beef, melted Swiss, mushrooms, and onions) and a creamy chicken noodle soup which comes with a bread bowl. Both were delish and cost only $6.29. I'm craving both again as I write this. I will have to try another one of their soups when I come back. This location does get pretty busy. We stopped by for a late lunch and just beat the crowds that came in about 5 minutes after us.

Went to see the Lion King here Friday night and there really isn't a bad seat in the house. Yes, the interior is a little warn and dated, but even seats in the back or higher up in the balcony areas are great.   This was a fabulous show. It's not just for kids. The music was great and the costumes were very colorful.   There was however this douche bag and his girl who didn't know how to use their inside voices and were having regular conversations throughout the play. We had to tell them a couple of times to STFU. Otherwise it was good. They apologized after my boyfriend confronted them at the end of the show. They were in their 40's! They should know better. There was a 4 year old sitting next to me that didn't make a peep. The guy said they were celebrating their "anniversary and reunion" not sure how both are possible. The usher said the chick was practically in his lap the whole play and she said that she thinks they were probably out fooling around. Who knows but this guy needs to get out more and learn how to behave in public.

I loved the setting. HOT is located on a fairly busy street, but you would never know it sitting on the patio surrounded by trees. Free parking is available at the meters after 6 pm Monday through Saturday.   They have a lot of outdoor seating, I actually didn't take a peek inside other than to wash my hands before dinner. The space on the wooden patio outside is cozy (that means that some of tables are pretty close together). We sat right next to the fireplace, but they also have plenty of heat lamps to keep you warm on a chilly night. And the tables are pretty small to keep everything on them (2 water glasses, 2 wine glasses, candle, 2 bread plates, 2 dinner plates, utensils, salt and pepper, flower vase, bread basket, butter). We had to move some stuff to the top edge of the fireplace.   We were still pretty stuffed from our heavy lunch so we passed on starters and decided to munch on bread and order dinner. The bread was pretty good, but the lemon poppy butter (it changes every night) was amazing. It was so light, sweet and tangy. We expected to get more of it when we asked for more bread and butter, but they just brought out plain butter. Our waitress said they had only make so much because it changes every night, so you have to ask specifically for it their special butter of the night if you want more. Weird that they were already out since it was maybe 7:30 pm.   For dinner I had the ballotine of chicken stuffed with brioche foie gras stuffing (you get 3 pieces), cognac demi glace, sautéed spinach and butternut squash puree. It was heaven. And all went together perfectly. Mike had the beef tenderloin on horseradish whipped potatoes, sautéed spinach, bacon onion jam and red wine demi glace. Although he ordered it medium it came out almost well done. It was kind of hard to immediately tell the donenss when he cut into the steak (other than the texture) because it is pretty dark outside. The wait staff really should have a small flashlight and wait for you to cut into it so you can tell.  However, they quickly apologized for the mistake and promptly brought out a new plate. Mike said the meat wasn't very flavorful.   This place can be pretty pricey. For just 2 dinners and 2 glasses of wine, plus tax and tip our bill came out to be just over $90. The atmosphere was nice and the food was good, but I thought it was just a bit overpriced. Heard that lunch is a better deal so I'll have to come back for that.

I visited Pizzeria Bianco last spring after my boyfriend and I checked out the Titanic exhibit at the Arizona Science Center. It was just around the corner. We got here at about 3:30 on a Friday and there were already more than a dozen people ahead of us in line. We waited for them to open, take our names and then we headed next door for drinks and appetizers. What a fun experience. We chatted up with the couple that had been ahead of us in line and enjoyed a beautiful evening in the garden area.   We each got a pizza and they were both delicious. Everything tasted so fresh. The crust was cooked to perfection. We sat right next to the oven and it was so cool watching Chris make everything. We will definitely be back and bring friends next time.

I really wanted to like you, but you spilled my boyfriend's soda and cleaned up your counter, but not my boyfriend's glass. And upon check in you told us to sit outside and have a drink as we waited and told us you'd remember to come and get us when our table was ready. But you forgot about us and marked us off as seated. So we waited an hour and had no food. Boo. Maybe this just wasn't meant to be.

So we finally decided to give Cibo another chance and I'm so glad we did!  I love love love their patio. It's very cute and romantic especially with all the lights wrapped around the trees. The heaters keep you warm on a chilly night and it's much quieter than their indoor space. This place is a great date spot.   We both had the Prosciutto Cruda pizza and had wanted to try the burrata, but unfortunately they'd been out of it for the last week so we ordered the bruschetta instead. Our waiter also recommended the Valpolicella Ripasso, which was ok, but it was a little light for our tastes. The pizza was really good (the fresh ingredients really come through), but we weren't the biggest fans of the crust. I like something more substantial and airy. But  for a thin crust pizza it wasn't soggy at all. A big plus! The bruschetta was also ok (don't get me wrong I still ate all of it and would order it again), but each bite just needs a little more of a punch.   Service was great and we met Karen, the owner, before we left and she is a doll. We had a much better experience this time around and we will certainly be back.

Worth every penny. Best steak I've ever had. I had the Kona sirloin and my boyfriend had the fillet and we were both in heaven. Steaks were perfectly cooked and seasoned. They melted in our mouths. Be prepared to spend about $40/steak. We shared the mashed potatoes and they were so creamy. The Caesar salads were ok. The wine list was a little overwhelming (well for us) but our waiter made some great suggestions. For dessert I had the flour-less chocolate cake, which was rich and my boyfriend had strawberries and ice cream (forget what it's called the Capital Grille or something like that) which was so good.

I really don't understand what people are ordering that they say that the serving sizes here are small. My meal came with a pork chop, 2 eggs, and hash browns, which I could barely keep all on my plate (it was so much food) and a side of thick sourdough toast (2 slices). Mike ordered the fives pot which was just a sandwich. Considering we had waited almost an hour for breakfast we also ordered a side of bacon (so yummy!) and one pancake so we could try a few other things. The people sitting next to me at the counter ordered the special omelet which also took up the whole plate.   This place is so tiny. There were three tables in the main eating area (which could seat 2-3 each), 6 seats at the counter, 3 more seats in the side room at a counter and two spaces where they could seat parties of about 4-5.   Although it took quite some time just to get in (and you have to wait outside to be called, keep this in mind if  you are there on a cold day) it doesn't take very long to get your food. It took 10-15 minutes to get our food. By the time we finished they had already turned over all of the tables.   The staff was very friendly and the food was good. My pork chop was juicy and I loved the hash browns and bacon. Mike's five spot wasn't as tasty. The eggs were overcooked and a bit dry. He wished he would have had the pancakes instead.   They have some good eats.

My prom date brought me here 10 years ago. Hmm...I wonder what he was expecting at the end of the night. Although he thought that tanning until he was as red as a lobster was the new black this was one of his better judgment calls.    We had a window seat and I mesmerized him with fascinating facts about the city, which were on little plaques along the windows. It really took him until the end of dinner to figure it out. Anyway, I am sure the menu has changed, but the salad and shrimp with angel hair pasta I had that night were yummy. Cool view. I will have to come back sometime to see how the valley has changed from this view.

I was not a fan of this location, the service here, or the food. It  just tasted different. Too bad because this one is a lot closer to home.

I trekked all the way here from east Mesa because I had to have BBQ. It was worth the trip.   We got the Hog Heaven meal which is only $28 on Sundays. It included a  1/2 lb of the following: chicken, pulled pork, ribs, and brisket. It also comes with 2 sides. No substitutions. This in enough to feed 3-4 people. We had plenty of leftovers. All of the meats were seasoned and cooked to perfection. They were all very moist and flavorful. I couldn't pick a favorite because they were all so good. We ordered the fries and mac and cheese as our sides. The mac and cheese very thick and creamy. Yummy! I usually don't eat corn bread because more times than not, I find it to be too dry, but even this stuff was great. I have no complaints!  Smitty, our waiter, was fantastic. He was always checking on us and our drinks. It's really dark inside, so next time I'd opt to eat out on the covered patio. They have fans going out there to keep it cooler and it seems more casual than the inside.   The sugar coated donuts at the end of our meal were the perfect ending to a great dinner.

Came back again and this time brought some friends to help us eat the Hog Heaven meal and we still had a ton of yummy left overs. Our waitress (I think her name was Megan, sorry I can't remember now) was super patient with us. She was always on top of things. Jason, the manager, came by and said hi to all the patrons. What a nice guy!  Look forward to coming back here again and again. Sign up for their newsletter!  I just got an offer for a free appetizer.

Came here late one night and my boyfriend and I shared dinner in the bar area. We ordered the lasagna and it was just enough for 2. In all honesty, I think he would have like to eat more, but I was hungry too so he couldn't have it all to himself. It was delicious.   We were looking at the pictures they have hanging in the bar area and noticed that two older ladies that were sitting in the bar area having drinks and dressed to the nines, were also pictured on the wall. This must be the spot for local celebrities!  :p    I'll definitely have to come back here and try something else from their menu.

I love The Big Bang and I'm not embarrassed to admit it. There's something about coming here on a Friday night after a long day at work, getting drunk, singing loudly, and imagining that I'm a rock star (and not tone deaf) that just puts me in a good mood.   Yeah, there's a cover and the drinks aren't cheap but it's still a good time. I try not to pee when I come here because the lines are always long and once I break the seal I am a goner.

I've been coming here for 10 years and still love it. The bbq beans are really good. My favorite thing to get here is a jumbo baker (and they mean jumbo) with everything on it including a side of chopped beef and then I add their homemade bbq sauce to it. Sooooo good. Their homemade root beer and limeade are also yummy. I remember them having a customer appreciation day once a year (I think in May) where lunch and dinner and free! You would get a pulled pork sandwich, a side and a drink for nothing. The lines would be out the door, but the food is worth the wait. I also remember them offering a free dinner (can't remember the choices) on your birthday. It's a cute little place in downtown Gilbert. Check it out.

This place was ok. Parking does suck. I don't understand why they have valet but it was cheap so we used it.   A major plus here is their patio. It appears to be bigger than the restaurant and you can play boci ball! It was over a hundred degrees when I was here celebrating a friend's engagement and they turned off the misters. WHY??? The fans were still going but they didn't help much. I tried some appetizers. The artichoke dip tasted like cream cheese. I though the guac and salsa were better. And the service was so slow. We were here for 2 hours and only had 2 drinks and not by choice.   I actually came here during Yelp Eats week and was never informed that they were participating. We were only given regular menus. After I found out that they were a participating restaurant a couple of days after our visit I asked some of the other people who had been there if they were ever offered the alternative menu and not one person said they had.   Lame.

Went here with some of my girlfriend's for a birthday dinner. We called ahead and had no problems getting a table for a party of 8. We were seated immediately. The decor here is more upscale than most Mexican food restaurants. Kind of a courtyard feel.   Loved their frozen margaritas. It came with a swirl of sangria. The food was very light, not heavy or greasy like a lot of Mexican food restaurants. Great mix of combinations so you can try a few different things. I had the Laredo and was not disappointed. The food arrived promptly and our server was very attentive the whole night.

My boyfriend and I go here at least once a month. We love to sit at the bar because the wait here is always long and the bartenders are so friendly here. We stick to a basic thin crust pepperoni, which is always good, but I've also had the Lady is a Scampi pasta and that's pretty good too. My favorite part is the chocolate chip pizza cookie! Yummy. Great patio to have lunch or dinner and a beer on a nice day.

I love coming to the Art Walk. This is a great way to spend a Thursday evening during the spring and fall when the weather here is perfect.   Some of the galleries even have free wine samples. There are some pretty interesting galleries here to check out.

I've been here quite a few times for after work drinks with coworkers since it's just down the street from where I work. It's an ok place, but with 4 Peaks just on the other side of the parking lot we usually tend to pass on this place.   We went yesterday and it was a disappointment. We got there before they started charging a cover (at 4 pm) otherwise it would have been $10 to get in. I'm guessing that this was to pay for the limited tables, chairs and one tent they rented. Also the band who was singing "Your Body is a Wonderland" and something else by Snow Patrol. Also they were charging $6 for drinks. It was just a little ridiculous. It was pretty much imposable to get drinks or food inside, which those of us who have tried their food before, weren't big fans of anyway. And to top it all off they closed Rubio's next door.   A funny sight were these two ladies who brought a little girl who looked like she was 6 and 2 babies who didn't look old enough to walk. The moms' had a beer in one hand and were each pushing their stroller with the other. I know times are tough, but it you can afford buying a $6 beer, you can afford getting a babysitter.

This is my favorite stadium to watch a spring training game. Maybe it's because I remember watching the Firebirds play here and well the tickets are cheap. I even get a $2-4 discount with my credit union debit card.   They sell Nathan's hot dogs! Yum! They also have margaritas and snow cones. You can't go wrong with either.   The views here are amazing although trying to get into the parking lot sucks. Great location. Not too far from Tempe or south Scottsdale.

Stayed here NYE 2007. Our room was large and I loved the bright colors and funky decor. But the big bathtub was the best part. I needed to soak for awhile after a long night of partying. The bed was really comfortable too, but I pretty much could have passed out anywhere at that point. The balcony was also large and overlooked the pool, and had some great lounge chairs, but I wish it was more private. A sail doesn't do much to give you some privacy from your neighbors.    Room service was also great the next morning when I needed some water, 7-up and toast to help my hangover.

This place is awesome. I decided to redo my living room and bought a microfiber sofa sectional that came with a matching ottoman. This is the way to go. You can lay out on it while watching movies. So much better than putting your feet up on a coffee table. And it was only $1k. Saw this style for twice as much everywhere else. It did take about 6 weeks for delivery, but this was a quality sectional at a great price and delivery was free so it was well worth the wait.   I also purchased a plasma TV and a TV stand. The stand was a great quality cherry console with 2 drawers and 2 cabinets on each side with glass fronts. This was a heavy duty sturdy piece for only $350. The only thing I had to assemble was putting in the glass shelves in the cabinets. Although I love Target I've seen stuff there for almost as much and some pieces that were even $100 more that still required assembly and were of so-so quality. This was a great deal. This item did not include delivery and was picked up at the store.   They have great quality furniture and electronics for a great price. Lots of stuff here. Living room sets, bedroom furniture and bedding sets, prints, electronics, dining tables, patio furniture, and all kinds of other stuff to decorate your home.   I plan on coming back here once I am ready to purchase a new bedroom set.

Yeah, I saw someones ass hanging out of their basketball shorts (must have been laundry day cuz he didn't have any underwear on), but that's part of the adventure.   I hate driving downtown (ok, I hate driving in general) so this alternative is a dream come true. The carts were clean and we didn't have to wait long for one to ever come by. We didn't have any problems and it stopped for a light maybe 3 times from the end of the track in Mesa to downtown and back. We got on and off about 3 times and we never saw anyone checking tickets even when it was packed and standing room only.  I can't wait until this thing runs until 2 am next month so we can check out some more places downtown and in central Phoenix.

This is my favorite spot for sushi in the valley. I think I've tried almost every roll here and have not been disappointed. The menu includes pictures, which I always love when picking out some fun options. They set the Volcano roll on fire and it just melts in your mouth. The Las Vegas and New York rolls are also good. The Hawaiian roll in good, the Spider (Crab) roll, I could go on and on. There are so many great choices. The staff here is also super friendly.   I'm getting hungry just thinking about this place. Just got to get the boyfriend to like sushi. I made him try the really good stuff in NYC and he hasn't been the same ever since.   :p

I've tried a couple of things here (prime rib, hamburgers, queso, fried combo) and everything was just ok. Nothing special or great. They also give you peanuts in a plastic dog bowl and you drop the shells on the floor.   This is a nice place to come and watch a game and chat with the friendly bartenders up at the bar. Cool neighborhood bar. They have live music here sometimes too, just can't remember which days.   Love all the pics of the dogs around the restaurant. I keep forgetting to bring pics of my two pups.

This Starbucks is awesome. No matter what time of the day I come here and regardless of whether I am ordering inside or through the drive-thru they always get me in and out pretty quickly.   I have gone to other locations that aren't nearly as busy and I feel like I always wait at least twice as long for my caramel frap.   Great afternoon pick me up when the work day seems like it's never going to end.

I usually come here to pick up steaks. The people in the meat department are always so helpful and friendly. This one lady in the meat department always recommends different prepared items (she knows I'm a sucker) and of course I always buy her recommendations. Hey, I have yet to be disappointed.   The store is always clean, sale items are always in stock, and the lines are never more than two people deep.

Boring. It's a City Walk wanna be.  Pretty much against my will I came out here because one of Mike's friend's was in town and staying with someone who lived out here. I was hoping to convince them to meet in the middle and go downtown, but no luck. I don't get why you would take an out-of-towner here when it's nothing, but chains, but whatever.   There's nothing special about this place. It was very bright and they blocked off the road between Saddle Ranch and Margaritaville, although I'm not sure why because I didn't think the area was that busy. The only plus here was the parking was free.

I finally visited all three of Joe Johnston's places. And I am stuffed. I've been going to Joe's BBQ since 1998, tried Liberty Market in November and finally on my birthday went to Joe's Farm Grill for lunch.   And got my meal for free! What a nice surprise.  Mike had the Double Dogs (2 hot dogs) with onion rings. The onion rings were so crispy and goooood. The hot dogs were decent. He said he would get them again. I would be willing to get them on another visit if they were covered in chili and cheese. I had the BBQ Bacon Burger and it was was absolutely delicious (I'm craving it right now just writing this review) with their regular french fries. The fries were also very good. Fresh and crispy. The burger was topped with cheese, BBQ sauce, an onion ring, bacon and blue cheese. Unbelievably good. And we couldn't pass up having milkshakes for dessert. You can pay for them at the time that you order your meal and go to the pick-up counter to get them when your done eating and bypass the line.   I loved all the outdoor picnic table seating and the huge tree in the back. The bathrooms are worth taking a look at. Just a little strange. The fireplace in the dining room is original to the house. It's a little dangerous that this place is so close to home. If you are coming during the lunch hour get here just before noon when it gets really busy.   I heard they will be having all kinds of specials in March to celebrate their appearance on "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives," and their episode will re-run on the Food Network a couple of times in March also.

Saw The Dark Knight in this theater and the screen was huge and the sound was excellent. The kiosks where you can purchase tickets instead of waiting for an open window are great. And I agree with another Yelper who said there weren't as many teenagers just hanging out here.   Parking here is a pain and I wish they had better dining options nearby.

They have a great patio close to my work so we come here sometimes for happy hour. Don't waste your money on the food. It's horrible. And sometimes it seems near impossible getting the staff to get you chips and salsa and then to get refills. The only plus I can really think of it the patio.

The food here was gross. Our waitress was clueless. I don't think they actually cook anything here. They must just have a micro to nuke whatever frozen stuff they buy. Will never come back here. Came here with my boyfriend, his sister and her 2 kids and no one had a meal they liked. Not even the chicken tenders or hamburgers. Stay away!

Ugh, this place was so cheesy. It's like they tried to make a really trendy bar with a budget of $100. Trading Spaces gone horribly wrong.   The mirror at the table we were sitting at was broken, there were uncomfortable clear plastic chairs to sit in, a long velour/velvet (I really don't know what this material was) couch, techno music. Aaahhh! Why did I come here?   And after all of that, the drinks are expensive.   The outside patio looked nice, but I never made my way out there.   I won't be back. Too bad because this is in a good location in Old Town.

Although I prefer the beer at another local brewery, this place has amazing food. We all had trouble deciding what to order. I tried only one wing, because the guys devoured them. I should have taken pics of their sauce stained faces. I had the stuffed mushroom burger, which was amazing and I couldn't get enough of their beer battered fries. My friend's rib eye philly sandwich also looked really good and that will be the next thing I try when I come back. Service was a bit slow. We asked to sample some beers before we ordered and it took forever for our waitress to bring them out. We thought she had forgotten about us. But the food was worth the wait.   There was live music when were were there for dinner on a Sunday. The guy was pretty talented.

This place is horrible. I had the worst margarita ever here. The last time I was here, a few of us (about 4 or so) met some friends (about 4 or so too) who had been drinking at sitting at a table for over an hour. When we walked in their was no hostess so we sat ourselves at the table next to our friends and ordered some drinks. For the next hour a waitress never came over to us. Fine we were seated close to the bar so we kept ordering drinks from there. Finally my boyfriend got hungry and decided to order some food from the bar because no one had helped us. Well as we were waiting the douche bag manager came over and asked us to move because they were trying to seat people for dinner. There were other tables still available and we mentioned to him that we had ordered food and were waiting for it, just not from a waitress since no one had come ever come over to help us. He continued to try and bully us out because we had not been seated by a hostess (there was no hostess at that time and no one had said anything for the last 2 hours) but we wouldn't budge because we were waiting for food. My boyfriend ate and we left. Such horrible service. Please read the other reviews, the management and service here sucks. We're never coming back.

Writing this a little late, but we came here during Restaurant Week. We were seated in a small dining area, which felt closed off from the rest of the restaurant. I wasn't a fan of the lighting. I felt like I was in a fitting room.   Anyway the service here was great. Our waiter explained both the Restaurant Week menu and their regular menu. They immediately brought us the duck fat fries and 3 dipping sauces. I love them all. The french fries were great. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. This is a great starter.   We tried the cauliflower veloute and the beef carpaccio for our appetizers. The carpaccio was ok. It did have too many unnecessary ingredients. The cauliflower veloute however was divine. It was so smooth and creamy. It included a lobster fritter and pieces of apple. I could have had a bucket of this for dinner and have been in heaven. We also received some focaccia bread with out appetizers. It was so warm and buttery. We hadn't even had our actual dinner yet and we were getting full. They certainly give your your monies worth.   We both ordered the flat iron and short rib for our entrees. We got a little bit of each, which was just enough since we had quite a few other things to eat on the table. The flat iron steak was juicy and flavorful. The short rib was tender but just not as appealing as the steak.   Lastly we shared the mascarpone cheesecake and the beignets with the butterscotch creme. Both were delicious. The beignets came with more than enough creme so we took a bit and layered it on top of the cheesecake. Yum.   Nice place for dinner. I love coming to the Princess to lounge and have after dinner drinks. The open air bar with their huge lounge area is a great place to come on a nice night and enjoy our beautiful weather.

Came back to La Bocca last night. The only other time I've been here was  for the Yelp Elite event last Sunday, but after that experience, we knew we'd be back. We told the hostess we were just here for dessert and she sat us at a great cozy table for 2 in one of the corners of the restaurant, which was pretty busy. Our server was really friendly and immediately got our drinks and put in our order for the OMG. Our dessert came out in no time and it was DELICIOUS. ice cream, and melted chocolate with espresso. It was like a gooey brownie. We saw the server who waited on us during the Elite event last Sunday and he said hi. Everyone here is so friendly and attentive. Our server and one of the owners both waited on us. They have relaxed happy hour specials from 11-6:30 pm and live music on Thursdays so we'll be back.

Wow. There is a lot of stuff here to try. Yea! Olive oils, balsamic vinaigrettes, tapenades.   The tour is not really for little kids. You sit outside where all the benches are for half of it and listen to the guide talk about the mill and then you go into a very small room where they make the olive oil, where the guide continues explaining the process. It's not an ideal situation for an energetic kid. At the end of the tour you get to try a couple of stuffed olive samples.  They have a lot of places outside where you can sit and enjoy lunch. We had the Kalamata and Manzi. I prefer hot sandwiches so I thought the Manzi was delicious. I had some of their prickly pear lemonade and it was so good. They would run out within minutes of setting it out. Be sure to try it out! We also bought a small loaf of bread and filled a few of the sample cups with a couple of different types of olive oil and vinaigrettes and headed out to sit under one of the olive trees.   Don't count on their site to be accurate. We went on the first Sunday of their Festival of the New Oil and even though they said there would be wine tastings there weren't. You can't tell me there will be a wine tasting and not come through. Minus one star.   I only came away with a few goodies (gourmet dipping oil and asiago and Parmesan tapenade) and spent just over $20. Lots of great gifts!

Had such a wonderful dinner here. Boyfriend and I came here for dinner before heading out to the Cine Capri the day the new James Bond movie came out. It was a perfect evening to sit outside. The patio is great for people watching, although my boyfriend had a better time checking out all the sports cars that drove by. Eric was our server and he was phenomenal. We made sure to talk to the manager before we left and we had made reservations thru Open Table and also raved about him there and sent an e-mail.   My boyfriend is pretty picky so we chose the melted tomato, basil, and warm ricotta bruchetta to start . It came with 4 pieces and we devoured them in minutes. It was yummy. We also had the bread with the sun-dried tomato butter, which was also good. For dinner he had the pasta bolognese and I had the osso buco. Both were very generous servings. His was good, but I'm not sure what it was, I think fennel, was a bit overpowering. The osso buco was sooooo good. The meat and polenta melt in your mouth. I was in heaven. Could not have made a better selection. I can't wait to come back here and bring my family for my birthday next month. Our waiter suggested a nice red wine with our meal with was a perfect compliment, but I can't remember what it was called. Oh, well. We never felt rushed during our meal even though we did take our time for a Friday night. I'm definitely coming back!

Came here with my parents and aunt and uncle Saturday night. My aunt and uncle had been here before and loved the food and the group that plays on the weekends.   Service is so slow. Don't come here hungry. You will certainly die of starvation before the waitress even brings your salad.   We got the Saturday night special which was two 3-course dinners for $40. It came with a salad, main entree (3 to choose from) and dessert (2 to choose from). After waiting about 30 minutes for our salads we were told they were out. But no offer was made to give us anything else as our appetizer. Then about 5 minutes later our salads magically appear but were not as described on the online menu. The salad for the special was described as, "Spring mixed greens, tomatoes, radishes, avocado and Queso Fresco cheese with Chipotle vinaigrette. Served with grilled bread topped with butter and cilantro oil." The salad we got was finely chopped iceberg lettuce topped with some mixed spring greens on top, which tried to hide the iceberg lettuce because I didn't notice the iceberg lettuce when it was served. There were a couple of sliced grape tomatoes and the vinaigrette. And no grilled bread with butter. Because we had waited so long we were also brought out the queso fundido, which was the only nice touch to the service. It was ok. It lacked flavor.   For our main entrees we got the steak fajitas and pescado con salsa verde (which was tilapia with a cream sauce). The fajitas were pretty good, but they never gave us tortillas for them. The tilapia was better. Both came with rice and the fajitas also came with beans.   Lastly we got both desserts that were offered. Strawberry cheesecake and strawberries and cream. Both were good.   Also our server messed up our drink orders a couple of times and rarely came over to see us. The food was good, but not worth coming back for with the horrible service.

Less than $10 for a huge sandwich and drink. The sandwiches are pretty big, one is really like the size of 2.   I had the California Turkey and the turkey was seasoned and cooked to perfection. The grilled meat was warm, tender and moist. Loved the avocado mayo, vinaigrette and roasted tomatoes. One of my coworkers got the Cuban pork and that looked delicious as well. We both wanted to try each others sandwiches, but were too busy scarfing down our own to share. Think we'll split the two sandwiches next time so we can have both.   The place was cute and clean inside. We got there before noon and although there were quite a few tables already taken up, there was no line to order. You order at the counter and then move along to pay at the cashier. You serve your own drink, but they come by your table to serve your meal. We waited about 5-10 minutes to get our food. They have quite a bit of seating inside at tables or at a bar type set up and also seating outside.   I can't wait to come back. I'm already craving another sandwich from this place.

The management here is completely unprofessional. We came here when there was apparently a UFC fight on (we had no idea and just wanted to watch football). We stopped and checked in with the hostess but because the fight was on all she said she could do was put our name on the list and couldn't quote us any kind of a wait time. Wow. Ok. So since the bar is usually open seating Mike tells her he's going to head over to see if there are any open tables there. He finds one and proceeds to sit down when a manager starts yelling at him that he can't sit there. He asks why (Who wouldn't?) and she tells him because he just can't.  So he walks back to the hostess where I am waiting and tells us what happened and the the hostess apologizes and tells us that only the rail at the bar is open seating. Um, thanks. Not sure why she didn't tell us that in the first place. And I'm not sure why the manager of all people just didn't say that is wasn't open seating right now and suggest that we sit at bar rail.   I can understand that things can get stressful when the place is packed and people are drinking, but that is no excuse as a manager to have a bad attitude.

We came here for happy hour a few weeks ago and had a great time. Definitely get here at the start of happy hour because the place fills up quick. They also have happy hour outside on the patio, but with the weather at 110+ outside it wasn't a popular option. But it looks like a great spot to have sunset drinks once it cools off a bit. They have a lot of great plush seats at the bar top and in the lounge area. But it can get loud inside. We had a few glasses of their malbec (delish) and lots of food! The sliders and charcuterie plate were good, but the popovers and steak tartare were sooooo freaking amazing.   The tartare had a bit of a kick and I loved it! The popovers are huge. I can certainly see why they are so popular and they even give you a recipe card to take home. Thank you, I think I will try to make these. Hopefully they don't turn into a disaster like some of my pinterest fails.   We were told that they will be shaking up the preparations on a few of their happy hour items soon. And their cocktails look fun, so I will definitely have to try those next time. Oh yes, there will be a next time.

I like this location better than the one in Old Town, which is the only other location I've been to. It's a pretty small restaurant, but they also have a small private room in the back for gatherings.   The ingredients all taste fresh and if you sit at a high top in the bar area you can watch them make the pizza. I love watching the prep! We  actually forgot our leftovers after our last visit and one of the waiters came out to give them to us. So nice!  If you're lucky you may find parallel parking spot right out front, but there's also more parking in a big lot just to the west of the restaurant. And the best part is you can walk off your meal by strolling around the shops.

A meat feast!  Woo hoo!  I am STILL full.   The staff was great. Everything was delicious. I really can't pick a favorite. I wish I would have been able to have more of what was offered at the salad bar, but I wanted to save as much room as possible for all the meat. And there was plenty of it.   Thank you Rolando for taking us on a tour of the kitchen. This was so neat. I think he said all but 2 of the cooks were Brazilian.  And thank you Gabi for putting this together. We had an amazing time.  :)

The restaurant is located on the fifth floor of the Phoenician. You can valet your car and take elevator C or D up to the restaurant. We got a table where both of us were seated looking out the window. Although it may make for an early dinner I would suggest coming here before sunset. The daytime views were more beautiful than the view at night.   Service after we ordered was a bit slow. It took quite some time for them to bring out bread for us even after drinks had been ordered. And our waiter was also pretty snobby.   The butternut squash soup with mushrooms was amazing. I wanted to lick the bowl clean. I can't explain how much I loved it. I would come back here just to have this soup and enjoy the view. Mike had the arugula and Boston lettuce salad with the mustard vinaigrette and it was just too peppery. I only had a bite of this and it was all I could take. It had some radishes thrown in with the greens. It was boring. Not a fan. He ordered the sirloin cap steak with frites for dinner and it came with a house made steak sauce. The steak was cooked perfectly medium and although Mike loves his steak sauce unfortunately he wasn't a fan of J&G's. I had the slow cooked salmon. It was served over a potato puree, with julienned veggies on top and a basil vinaigrette on the side. This dish was also very good. I had never thought of combining basil and salmon together, but the pairing was delicious. And the potato puree was so smooth and creamy. Lastly we both got the warm chocolate cake and caramel ice cream for dessert and it did not disappoint. The portions here were pretty generous. I was stuffed after dinner.   The restaurant has a dark sleek vibe (lots of leather tiles on the walls). The bar area was also beautiful. Tables are pretty close, but it didn't seem like the restaurant was too loud or that I could hear everyone's conversations around me. We'll definitely come back to try some other items on the menu.

WOW. THIS PLACE IS AMAZING.   We went early Friday night and each got 4 courses with wine pairings. You get a small menu with a list of proteins. You mark off what you don't want to try and list any dislikes or allergies. You know I had to put down that I don't like corn. I went with the chef's choice and Mike went with the carnivore selection.   Everything was delicious and cooked to perfection. The meat, seasonings, broths, and vegetables were all divine. We had heirloom tomatoes, duck with green beans and squash, baby octopus with snap peas, kobe beef with artichokes, and kangaroo with fingerling potatoes and shitake mushrooms. Sorry, if I can't remember exactly what was in the meals, as I was too busy devouring every bite. And why didn't anyone ever tell me that kangaroos where so tasty? I pretty much licked everything off both of our plates. Dessert was also very yummy. I had a chocolate pate. I don't remember what Mike had as he had finished before I had a chance to get a second bite.   The entire staff was very friendly. We sat at the bar and chatted with Josh, Zac and the amusing Kirby. It was fun watching them make all the dishes. This was such a great dining experience.   The lollipop at the end of our meal and cookies to take home were a special treat. I'm sure Mike is already regretting bringing me here because it's not a cheap meal and I want to come back. You have to try this place.   You can find complimentary valet parking off the garage at Rancho Vista Dr.

Woohoo! This is as good as it gets! I actually prefer this location to the original. They have a great covered patio. We love to introduce people to this place.   Everything here is delicious. Yes, everything. You can't go wrong with their bruschetta, but their salads and paninis are delicious as well. I love to order a half salad (raspberry chicken) and half sandwich (nine iron). They always have a great wine selection. And you know I'm going to get my wine on whenever I am here.   You absolutely must get the salted caramel sundae for dessert. DO IT. Who new chocolate covered corn nuts could be so good?

This is such a fun drive! But it's not for those who get car sick or dizzy on the teacup ride at Disneyland (yeah, I'm talking to you mom).   Anyway, there are a lot of twists and turns along this drive if you start it out in AJ. You can take a paved road all the way to Tortilla Flat which is just past Canyon Lake. You can stop at Canyon and go fishing or enjoy other water activities or stop at Tortilla Flat and grab a bite to eat at the restaurant and ice cream next door at the parlor. You can drive a few miles past Tortilla Flat on a paved road, but then it's dirt to an overlook (beautiful by the way), which can be a bit rough on a small car. If you plan on taking the dirt road bring a truck or SUV. Wish we could have gone further. Oh, well. We'll have to save the rest of the trip all the way to Roosevelt Lake for another day. Depending on where you live in the valley this take take up a few hours or the whole day.   Bring your patience, as you may get stuck behind someone towing a boat.

One of my favorite spots for happy hour (I think it is daily from 3-6) in the valley. I love their open and spacious patio. They have a beautiful view. And live music everyday on the patio at 7. Valet parking is free.   I love to get their special margarita during happy hour, it's always something fun an different. The last one I had included thyme and it was yummy! Some of our favorite happy hour items are the salsa sampler, guac, carne asada tacos, chicken quesadilla, and filet mignon sliders all under $7. We usually get the salsa and and maybe 1 or 2 other items which easily make a full meal.   The large fire pits are a great spot to sit if you are looking to socialize with other guests. There's not an uncomfortable seat outside where you can't just sit back and relax, which you will since the service is also pretty relaxed.    Please note, they always ask us if we are a guest at the hotel or not when ordering and take our credit card if we are not.

I loved the pizza, the service not so much. We came here a few weeks ago, when Saturday nights were still date nights (before college football season). There was a short wait for a table in the dining room, but we found some seats at the bar and decided to sit there instead. Oops. Although there were at least 4 bartenders behind the bar and they weren't busy they were all standing around and chatting and pretty much ignored those trying to order. Finally one of them came over to take our order. Luckily there were many of them behind the bar because the girl we ordered from was almost nonexistent for most of the night.   The pizza was so good. Thin and cheesy with a crispy crust.   We will absolutely have to try the meat and cheese plate and the arancini next time. They both looked yummy.   Cool, sleek and clean atmosphere. I love the recycled wood.   I also love the herb garden near the entrance (I'm currently trying to not kill my own) and the patio looks like the perfect spot to eat and drink once the nights cool down around here. I'd love to just have a meat and cheese plate out there with a glass of wine and just relax.

This is the worst Paradise Bakery I have been too. Mike and I came here last Friday night primarily to get some chicken noodle soup since he was feeling under the weather.   We get here and immediately someone tells us that this has been the night from hell and that they are out of a lot of stuff. Ok, thank you for welcoming me into your establishment.   We asked for a club and were told that the croissants were cooling. Ok, how long until they are ready? Response, "I don't know. A loooong time. But we can get it for you if you wait, but not if you are getting a to go order." So no croissants for us. I wanted a panini. Only one was available even though three were listed online for the menu for this location. They were out of one kind and I was told that they didn't offer the other even though it was listed as an option online. Fine, I took the only one they had. I then went to get a mixed greens salad and they were out of mixed greens and tomatoes. Who knows what else they were out of that we didn't ask for.   All the kids who were working here looked miserable to have to be explaining this to customers and be put in this situation. Where was management? No where to be seen.

I love this place. I visited the Desert Ridge location earlier in the year and really liked it, but was disappointed that there was not another location closer to my home. Well now there is. Woo hoo!  There's lots of parking directly across the street from the store. And they always have several registers open so even on a busy weekend day, you usually only have one other person in front of you in line. Pretty good selection and stock.   They now charge $0.10 for wine tastings (tried 3 wines) and they have them on Fridays (12-6 pm), Saturdays (11-6 pm), and Sundays (12-5 pm). They have a table set up in the middle of the store where you show your ID and drop a dime into the jar. They had a beer tasting going on at the same time. I wasn't interested in that so I didn't check out the dates, times, and cost for that. Sorry!   And the best part is there's actually people to help you here unlike some other big places like this that I've visited. Where there isn't an employee in sight.   Sign up on their website for their e-mails to get coupons.

I loved loved loved the decor. I felt like I was in a plush bedroom. Some of you may think that's strange for a dining establishment, but I found it comfortable. The whites, light blues, silvers and mauves just felt comforting to me like a fluffy made bed waiting for me to jump in.   Anyway...we ordered off the restaurant week menu. They also had a wine menu with at least a dozen different bottles for $30. What a great idea. Too bad I just wasn't in the mood to drink. I know my bf was shocked too. And no, I'm not pregnant.  First came the cheddar and bacon bread with a sour cream and chive butter. WOW. They also had a slice of a Parmesan bread, but it didn't compare to the loaded baked potato bread. I wanted more, more, more. But of course we hadn't even gotten to our appetizers yet. We had the crispy shrimp and corn and bacon chowder for our appetizers. The chowder smelled fantastic, but I didn't try it since the texture of corn freaks me out. The crispy shrimp was pretty good. Lots of shrimp. This app comes in a small bowl, but looks are deceiving. It contains a lot of shrimp. It's enough to feed 2. The sweet chili aioli was the prefect compliment.   We both ordered the filets for dinner. Medium rare is the way to go. It was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. The roasted mushroom and bordelaise were also great compliments to the steak.    Lastly for dessert, I had the peanut butter cup (which is pretty rich and is really enough for two) and Mike had the flourless chocolate cake, which came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and was over what looked like a chocolate rice crispy treat. The crispy treat apparently had nuts (not sure what kind), and there wasn't a warning on the menu, but they quickly gave us another plate without it.   Our waiter Eric was great. Had great wine recommendations and just a great personality. Water glasses were never more than half empty. Liked the vibe, food, and service. Will have to come back and try a burger (they looked huge!) and their happy hour menu looks pretty appetizing too.

I've lived here all of my life and had never heard of this place until Mike took me here one day a couple of years ago. What a well kept secret! Cool place to sit and relax and just listen to the falls. I've come here during the day and night and felt pretty safe.    Parking is just a short walk from the falls and it is free to visit!

Mike and I had no plans on Christmas Eve and we were so excited. We had 3 family events planned this week each on a different day, so we specifically indicated that we were doing nothing Christmas Eve, but relaxing and enjoying each others company. And it was great!   Came here to see a movie Christmas Eve and we enjoyed the theater very much. The lobby, theater and bathrooms were all very clean. The seats were comfortable. There are a few different chain restaurants throughout the mall and the mall food court is right next to the theater so you can stop and pick up a quick bite before you head in to see a movie.  I've been here a couple of times before and had the same great experience. And they always have a lot of registers open at the snack bar so I've never had to wait in line as

Culinary Dropout is located near PF Changs and Wildfish across the street from Scottsdale Fashion Square. You can find free parking in the garage underneath the restaurant. Don' let them sucker you into valeting. which is located just before the garage entrance.   They serve happy hour specials throughout the restaurant. The service is a bit slow. We ordered the pretzels and fondue app to start and it took forever to come out to us. I thought we would get it with our dinner, luckily the fried chicken took so long that it wasn't something we really should have worried about. In all fairness they did warn me that it would take awhile, which I appreciated and did take forever but I was craving fried chicken after being out in the sun all day so I was going to get it damn it. So worth the wait. It was crispy deliciousnesseses. The pretzels and fondue were good too, but you don't get enough pretzels to scoop out all the yummy cheese.    I have only sat outside so I didn't notice the loud music. Sit outside if you want to catch some great people watching (or car watching in Mike's case) from the patio and you want to be able to hear your dinner mate(s).

I've been to the original Vig and although I was a fan of the patio I was not a fan of the service. The service here was a bit better. I loved the vibe of this place and the Arizona room was pretty cool. The area next to the fireplace looks like a great place to hang out and have drinks.   The portions here pretty big, but I ordered the horseradish crusted tilapia and the serving was just right. It came with a quarter of a stuffed mushroom, which was different, but good. The roasted red pepper sauce that accompanied the fish was a great compliment. And the potatoes were yummy too. Everyone else had sandwiches, which were huge and enough for lunch the next day. The crabmeat and artichoke dip was also tasty.   I loved the atmosphere of this place much more than the Arcadia location and although this place is a little further form home and you have to valet, this is the one I will return to. I actually came back the day after my first visit just to have dessert in the Arizona room and so Mike could check it out. He liked it better too!

Came here after having dinner with friends at a brewery around the corner. I love paletas! I grew up in south Phoenix and looked forward to the paletero (guys with the carts and Mexican popsicles, I know you've heard them ringing their bells) every afternoon. After moving to the east valley the only thing that came by was the Schwann's truck. Wah wah. So I was super excited to know my childhood treat was a little closer to home. From what I can remember here are the flavors they have right now: pecan, spicy chocolate, mango, mango with chile, strawberries and cream, pineapple, arroz con leche (milk and rice with a hint of cinnamon, I use to have this for breakfast as a kid). I tried the pecan flavor and there were chunks of pecans in the paleta. So yummy! Every popsicle has an impression of Betty's bite mark. So cute.   There are also popsicles for the dogs. They are like frozen chicken treats.   *Don't forget to bring cash because they take cash only.

I came here for a Yelp event at the beginning of the year and was surprised that the place had changed names when I was hear last month. The atmosphere was dated and uninteresting. The main restaurant are was so crowded too. Not with people, but with tables. I almost felt claustrophobic.   I was so disappointed in the food here. Mike and I split a 3 meat combo platter with smoked sausage, beef brisket, and slow-smoked pulled pork. Everything just tasted so bland and dry. Their BBQ sauces were also boring. The mac and cheese I ordered also came with corn. Eew... It was not good. Our waitress was forgetful and really so was the whole experience here.

Such a fun place. So many things to choose from. Lots of variety at great prices. It can be a little overwhelming. This is the place to go if you are needing that one little accessory to complete your outfit. Everything is color coordinated so it's easy to find exactly what you are looking for. The staff is also very helpful and friendly. Coming back to pick out a few things I don't really even need.

I can't think of anything positive to say about this place. For the quality of food you get here, I think this place is overpriced. My boyfriend got the fillet and said it tasted like it had been refrozen then cooked. I don't know what that tastes is like, but I guess horrible. I had the salmon and it was flavorless and overcooked so was the rice. The bread didn't taste fresh and I wondered if it was just bought at the grocery store and heated up in the micro. Our server was slow and ignored us most of the night even though there were maybe 4 other tables seated in the place. And the singer was well, different... Won't go back here and won't recommend this place to others.  :(
