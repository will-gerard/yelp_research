Friendly and fast. they plumped my selection up to exactly what I was looking for, for a bosses' day arraignment at a far better price than what I am used to paying. My boss has gotten compliments by everyone who walks past her office. the flowers are still vibrant and fragrant. I'm glad I walked over from AJ's to compare. I even got a free rose when checking in on Yelp, and not a wimpy flower, it was a really nice rose. Turned around and surprised my babe  Brownie Points!

Great selection of steak and seafood. Not a place you go without increasing the limit on that Visa a little. We got the special salad, steak, seafood, 2 sides and dessert. After all was said and done we paid a little less than$200.00 for for an amazing meal and two glasses of wine for two people. It was worth every penny. We both got the Fillet Oskar, crab cakes,  asparagus, mashed potatoes, cheese cake, and the Merlot. It was a cozy 1940's type atmosphere with dim lights and attentive wait staff. It made me feel fancy :)

They are so nice and hospitable! Not the fanciest place but they made us feel welcome and had all the services to get you going. Discounted prices on full sets and pedi's, They also have Gel nails for only $22.00. I had Becky and she was so sweet.

Poor service - Dirty tables and they waited until after my order was in for 20 minutes to tell me they didn't have the item I ordered. I have to request a menu to order something else and then they told me there would be a wait because their kitchen was backed up. The food I did order was not very good, very inconsistent.

The sliders were the best I've tasted in a while! Real meat and a tangy sauce. the fisherman's platter was crunchy and the fillet was full. I didn't expect to get real food at an arcade but I was really pleased. My God daughter had a creamy macaroni and cheese with ham from the kids menu and we all had to eat some. Afterwards we worked our food off by playing arcade games with the kids. It was a blast

Drive through takes forever in the morning 20 minutes for one burrito. Egg Shells in my Carne Asada Burroito after I waited forever  :(

Not impressed - food was flavorless. The set-up was cramped but cute vintage and unique. Wait staff looked run down but were nice. My corn beef hash was mushy with uncooked veggies.  The basket of muffins was okay but dry. My wife's biscuit and gravy was bland and cold, potatoes had no seasoning. We wasted $30 and the only pleasant was the wheat toast and my son's pancakes. Even the bacon was soggy and it is hard to hate bacon. We will not return.

This review is for the bar service. While waiting for a movie we wanted to grab a drink 20 minutes before the mall closed. We stopped by Garcia's and the bartender was so rude, we went over to Rainforest. The bartender was friendly, fast, and even made a custom drink within 20 minutes. Drinks were good and we were happy!

Cocktails and food with little distraction. It's the same price as you would pay regularly, and the food is yummy. It's our new favorite movie experience so far.  Great date night!

I love this place. Its BYOB, the waiters are friendly, the owners are greats. Fresh, Fresh, Fresh! Like your sitting at a beach front restuarant in Phoenix. I was so so on Sushi until I found Hana. I recommend Hana over and over as the place to go, and every one that goes is estatic. The place is tiny but there is a patio area and also a bar counter which helps!

Standard nail shop. One of the girls is over the top rude. Nothing special but they will make sure to do a complete job and fix whatever is needed. There is one tech that is amazing but the others are standard and rude. They are also slow at times if you get the wrong tech. I took my sister in once and she saw a nail tech spit in the foot tub and rinse it out. She refused to go in after that. I've only does nails since but after a visit where the tech was arguing with a customer and then came back talking to me about them, I am changing shops for good.

When I stopped in to browse on a whim I was pleasantly surprised by the prices on the resale jewelry. I spotted a ring I fell in love with, and then fell in love all over again with the price so I called my BF right away.  I chose to use their layaway program. Jim and staff where knowledgeable and friendly. We even worked out a trade for our promise ring and reduced our final bill. I got way more diamond for my money than anywhere else and a huge box of chocolates with purchase (Perk) Every time we went to make a payment (or me to drool at my ring) there were new items. This place has lots of character and is not your big shiny stuffy chain store. If you are looking to get a good price on high quality resale jewelry, this is your place. They also make great offers on your existing jewelry.

Yummy rich flavorful creamy and smooth. Cheaper than other chains and so worth the drive! My son and I tasted all the flavors and settled on the Playdoh. It is a colorful and fun vanilla tasting ice cream and it is incredibly good. So good, that I bought a pint. I will be back again and again.

Great authentic Carib food. Loved the Ox-tail and Peas and Rice. You don't get a lot of Ox-tail for the price so beware. Friendly staff, and small space, but yummy food!

Great atmosphere! The place really goes far from the traditional nail shop without being a spa. Fresh fruit, a seperate room for acrylics, advanced treatment packages (real fruit scrub) , and cool decor. My nail tech wasn't to friendly but not rude either. My pedicure buddy had a swuper sweet talkative lady so I just had a bit of nail tech envy. The whole talking in a differnent language thing was present and I felt a little uncomfortable, but that's every shop! Overall worth a trip once in a while. The Pedi was about $15 more than a normal but came with like 5 extra spa-like services!!!!!!
