Too often, you eat out at a place for years, and because it's not new to you, it doesn't cross your mind to write them a review on Yelp.   That's what I realized when I went to grab a quick lunch to go from NYPD Pizza today. How have I never reviewed them? Because they've been a staple for several years, isn't that more reason to give them a great review? (I promise I'm going to start going through my memory bank and start writing more of these types of reviews)  So like I said, went to NYPD for a quick bite today. Ordered a small chicken ceasar salad to go. The cashier was a younger guy and really friendly. I thought there was a deal for checking in on FourSquare, but the manager that was standing nearby said it was only for dine-in with a group of 3 or more. He gave the discount to me anyways (shhh!). Extra points in my book. Salad came out quickly...drove back to work...and enjoyed a fresh and delicious lunch! The end. =)  (Oh and their garlic knots are ridiculous too)

I used to eat here all the time a few years ago when I had a client in the building there. They were definitely client meetings that I looked forward to each month because I got to indulge in the delicious food downstairs. I happened to be in the area today, and made sure to swing in for a late lunch. Yummmmm. My absolute fave menu items there are their hot croissant sandwiches, specifically the chicken cordon bleu or the white cheese heaven. Delicious flaky croissants, melty cheese galore. But as I am trying to eat a tad bit healthier, I sadly resisted my first choice and instead went for the chef salad. I'm happy to say it didn't disappoint. The portions were huge, tons of meat, delicious Italian vinaigrette dressing. Annnnd...the roll that they included was just as flaky and yummy as their croissants, so I at least had my carb craving fulfilled. Would highly recommend this place for a great breakfast or lunch spot.

I've driven by this place for the last 3 or 4 years every day on my way to work. Finally today, I stopped procrastinating and made the decision to finally try it out.  First of all...breakfast served all day? I love you already. As tempting as the omlettes sounded, it was a bit warm outside, so I went the refreshing route with the Cashew Chicken salad. Yummmmm. This is one of my favorite salads to get at anywhere I go, but places like Paradise Bakery and CPK tend to fill it with too much cabbage...this was the perfect amount of greens, chicken and toppings, and the sauce - delicious!  Service - great. You could tell the woman owner had a sarcastic-no BS sense of humor, which I find refreshing in the service industry.  Price...$7.11 for the full size salad. Cheaper than dine-in restaurants. More expensive than bagged salads from the grocery store. What can you do?  Atmosphere - nothing to really write home about. Not a place I'm going to meet with a client for a business lunch, but to grab food to-go for myself, absolutely. Nothing wrong with it...very clean & tidy. Just a bit too cafeteria style for my taste.   All in all...will definitely be back. Especially for the breakfast!

Came here last night, in search of something different. Such a cute hole in the wall place. Great service. AMAZING food. Seriously, we could not decide what to eat! We started off with the breaded and deep fried artichoke hearts and the Greek skins (potato skins filled with gyro meat, artichoke, feta and kasseri cheese). Both were absolutely amazing. We then split the Chicken Astoria entree - wow, to die for. Chicken, canadian bacon, asparagus, button mushrooms, baby corn, snow peas, artichoke, almonds in a marsala sauce.   Let me say that my fiance can eat, but even after the appetizers he was already feeling full. We didn't get far on the entree, even though we couldn't stop eating it. Very large portions. Somehow we managed to save room for dessert, since we've heard such good things about their in-house baker. Again, we couldn't decide, but ended up going with a slice of the carrot cake. As with everything else, amazing.  It was moderately priced - not too expensive, but definitely not a nightly eat-out spot. We will definitely be coming back here in the near future though. There are so many more things on the menu we want to try. Would highly recommend to anyone in search of a fun different place to eat in the East Valley.

Came here again for Valentine's Day. This place just keeps getting better and better. They were extremely packed but very accommodating, trying to seat us as quickly as possible. The meals did take a little bit longer to come to our tables due to it being a full house, but our server was on top of it, filling our drinks constantly without even having to ask, while we waited. And it was a special occasion being it was VDay, so my hubby and I just enjoyed getting to spend time together.   Food was fantastic as always. We got the Spanaki balls to start off with. Yum! For entrees, I had to try really hard not to get the Chicken Astoria again, but what to decide on? Everything looked so good! I ended up going with the Tortellini Gianni - cheese filled tortellini, italian sausage, scallions, garlic, mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, marsala cream sauce = delicious!  I can't even remember what my husband got, but he was in heaven as well. And don't let me even start on the dessert...  This place is going to continue to be one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona...by far.

Whenever I'm looking for a quick healthy lunch, and am tired of salads from the grocery store, I swing by Zoe's Kitchen on Camelback. For a long time I used to get the spinach and chicken quesadillas, however last time I went in, I realized they didn't have them on the menu anymore. The manager that was on duty was super friendly and helpful, and explained it was now basically the spinach roll-ups (add chicken). I must say, they are even more delicious!  Is it your cheapest lunch option? Probably not. I'm a frugal person by nature, but it definitely beats eating Fast Food. So it's worth the extra buck or two to know you're not loading yourself up with tons of grease and carbs. I've introduced a lot of my coworkers to Zoe's and they all love it too. Now if only they can open up in Gilbert or Chandler near where I live!

We've been coming here on Saturdays for the past month or so now, and still absolutely love it. Our dog Haleigh absolutely loves the water, even though she hasn't quite gotten the whole "jump off the pier" move yet. Still, it's such a great place for her to run around and socialize, especially since we both work during the week and it's hard to get her out.   There are usually TONS of dogs of all types and sizes, so there's never a shortage of friends for Haleigh. All the dogs are usually pretty well behaved, and have only seen one "fight" break out, which really was over quickly and was just a thing about dominance.   I just wish there was more grass and shade like some other parks we've been to, but you can't beat the lake here. Just be prepared to wear clothes you don't care about because there will be dogs shaking water on you from every direction. Also make sure to bring plenty of towels. We made the mistake of not bringing towels the first time we went, which resulted is us having to get a thorough car wash afterwards haha.  Absolutely will recommend this place to any of my friends w/ dogs.

I honestly don't like to write reviews about fast food places, because really, for the most part you get what you pay for, and there's nothing extraordinary, or un-extraordinary about the food usually...its just a quick easy fix.  That being said - really not impressed with the Chick-fil-A on Stapley. I went through the Drive Thru tonight - Friday night around 9:30. There's literally no one inside and only one car in front of me. And yet they had me waiting at the window forever for my food. Most fast food joints - you're in, you're out, done deal. Not the case here, at least not tonight.  I finally got my food, and the fries could barely pass as warm. I thought maybe the wait was because the guy was doing a new batch of fries, but no, these were quite stale, no salt, and pretty much cold within a short time.  The soda - Diet Dr. Pepper - was watered down.   There were like 8 people behind the counter just messing around not doing anything.  And it cost me over $7 for a crappy meal. Lesson learned, will not be returning there.

This place is great. We've been coming here for the last few years and they always do a great job. Reasonably priced, prompt service and friendly customer service. What more could you ask for? The owner of the company is often in and is very friendly and often the one checking in the clothes and ringing you up - it's nice to see a hands-on owner that cares about his customers. Always happy to support local businesses.

We too bought the Living Social Deal, and I was excited to use my first cleaning service just in time for my brother and sis-in-law coming into town this weekend. They showed up a half an hour early and got right to work. Did a great job and was so happy to see our home clean and dust free! With a dog and cat in our house, dust and hair build up pretty quickly, so I was impressed with how much they were able to conquer in just 2 hours. That being said, I was told based on our square footage (1275), they'd be able to finish the house within the 2 hours. They ended up not getting to the kitchen, and when I asked how much extra it would be, she said an additional $65!! I have lots of friends who's cleaning ladies do the whole house for $65, so I wasn't about to pay this for just one room. So I'll just have to clean the kitchen myself, not a big deal, but wasn't looking forward to this either. Even though they did a good job with what they did do, I might have to go with one of my friend's ladies next time if Tulip's prices are really that high.

I've been here quite a few times, and always love their food. Pretty good servings for the amount of money. Burger yesterday was a bit over-cooked, but the fries were great as always. I love how small it is - friendly staff and it always seems like the whole family is back there cooking and serving. Would definitely recommend.   So all in all, great for the money, and convenient because it's close to my work, but I wouldn't drive across town for it.

After driving by this place multiple times over the past few years, I finally got to try it today. I've gotta say I was quite happy with their food. The only down side (which really isn't a big deal) is the spacing. It's a very very small joint, so I wouldn't recommend coming here with a big group of people. Seating is very limited, with basically a few stools and counters inside and in the front outside, however there are a few bigger picnic tables out back. I think next time I'll shoot for the tables because the counter height compared to the stool height was very awkward (the counters were much higher, so standing is much easier). Maybe they do this so people eat and leave, instead of hanging around since it's so small to begin with.   Okay...all that being said, the food was great! I had the Bacon and cheese chicken sandwich with fries and a drink. And like many others have said, I was very happy to find it was only $5. And they definitely don't skimp on the portions...the sandwich was very filling and they filled a bag with a ton of fries. Oh and the fries...dont get me started! They had the perfect amount of seasoning, and were hot and crisp, so they obviously weren't sitting around forever.   My boyfriend had the Fat Ass burger...which I cant tell you exactly what was on it, all I know it was huge, and he absolutely loved it. The man can eat, and it filled him up, so that's a good sign.   All in all, I definitely recommend to others, and plan to go back again, maybe just different seating next time.

I'm a huge fan of coffee, so when Dutch Bros first opened, I had to try it out. It was maybe about a year ago or more when I decided to stop going because every time I tried one of their iced coffee drinks, it wasn't that cold...you had to shake the ice around a bunch just to get it to chill a bit.  A few weeks ago, after receiving some coupons in the mail, I decided what the heck - let's give it another go. I gotta say I was really impressed. I went with my usual fave - Iced Chai w/ non-fat and sugar free vanilla (i know, when did I turn in to such a yuppie, but damn is it good!). It had the perfect amount of sweetness and just enough spice (unlike the chai at Starbucks - way to spicy).   The next day I tried the Milky Way Freeze (i think that's what it's called). Very good, however I'm scared to think of how fattening it is because it comes in a pre-made blend. Oh well, I'll deal with it, because it really was tasty.  And this morning I tried a Strawberry Red Bull Smoothie. Eh - I'll pass on this next time. It was more of an Icee than a smoothie, and had a bit of a weird taste. To each his own.  The staff are always really friendly and upbeat. It doesn't matter what time it is, they have the music blasting and look like they are having a good time.   The only down side I can see of this place are the cups they use. They are definitely not made to sit back and relax. Within a half an hour or so you can feel the material of the cup start to get soggy. So if you slam your coffee, this isn't an issue, but if you like to savor it, I might recommend asking for 2 cups.  All in all...a good place but I'll still go for Extreme Bean over Dutch Bros.

I meant to do this earlier, and finally remembered to get on here and give this guy a great review! I'm a newbie to carpet cleaning, and from the very first phone call I knew George would be great. He answered every question I had, and helped me figure out what the costs would be. His scheduling was flexible which was great for me, because I had to go in to work afterwards. He was in and out in no time, but the results looked like it took all day to get that clean! We have white carpets, and after baby spit-up, dogs &kitten dirt, friends spilling beverages, and just general wear, it was in need of some help. It looked brand new after George was finished with it. His prices weren't terrible either. For our living room, spare room, office and dining room, it cost $96. Granted we have a small-ish house, but still, price seemed right to me for all he did! I would highly recommend George and his service to anyone who asked.

Any place that serves breakfast past "breakfast time" gets an immediate gold star from me. That being said, one of my favorite breakfast meals is eggs benedict. Imagine my happiness when going there today for the first time to find they had like 4 or 5 different variations of the traditional Benedict. I chose the Eggs Benny Florentine - english muffin topped with sauteed spinach, grilled tomato slices, grilled turkey, poached eggs and a delicious baja sauce. Mmmmm soooo good. I saw about 20 other things on the menu that I would have loved, but this was a real winner. I will definitely be back here again.

I'm currently enjoying some of the most delicious ice cream I've ever had!  That being said, my fiance and I were looking for a place to grab some ice cream, but wanted to avoid the typical chain spots like Cold Stone, Dairy Queen, etc. New to Gilbert area, I Google Searched ice cream places nearby and stumbled upon this place.   It's a tiny place in a strip mall, and nothing really out of the ordinary about the ambiance of the place, but the service and tasty selections were excellent. Right off the bat, the woman working behind the counter was super friendly and asked if we had ever been there before. She then let us sample almost every single kind, each one better than the next.  My fiance and I both got the waffle cone, which we got two flavors in each. He got the Pralines & Cream and Coffee - he said the coffee flavor was pretty standard, but really great flavor. He did say the Pralines & Cream was amazing, probably the best he's ever had.  I got Cookies & Cream for my first flavor, a usual choice for me. It was so rich and creamy with just the perfect amount of Oreo. For my second flavor, I got Apple Pie. I never would have thought of this as a good ice cream choice, but man was it good - again rich and creamy with graham cracker crust...so yummy!  What I forgot to mention is they make everything there in store. We got to sample some vanilla ice cream that just got done an hour ago and was so light and smooth, something you don't ever find at your typical corporate chain. They also make their own cheese and butter! Random I know, but hey, why not?  When my fiance was asking if they ever make certain flavors, the woman actually told us we can just call them up, and they'll special make it for us. How cool is that?  Pretty standard costs - I think both our waffle cones were like $4.75 each, which may seem pricey, but they definitely pile on the ice cream, I could have been very happy with one of their smaller sizes.  All in all, between how delicious the ice cream is, how they make everything from scratch there in store, and the excellent customer service, we will definitely be back!

I had to come back and write another review, because again, we were incredibly pleased with our experience. We stopped in on a week night when it looked like they were closing, but Casey (who I learned later was the owner) was happy to have us in. I found they had a lot of different flavors than the time we had been before, so Casey was so nice and patient and gave us samples of a ton of the different kinds. You could tell he was really knowledgeable and really proud of their ice cream. Most places would be in a hurry to shoo you out the door when they are getting ready to close, but they all kept talking to us about their different products and were some of the friendliest staff we've encountered here in the Valley. We highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a local ice cream shop with the tried and true flavors, but also some unique out of the box flavors too!

Only came here because we had a $10 off certificate. Will not be returning.  Came here in a Friday night around 8. Terrible service. Took our waiter forever to even come up and greet us. This is the type of place that serves peanuts and you throw em on the floor, so come expecting griminess. So we filled up mostly on peanuts, because again it took our waiter forever to even come take our food order.  There was a cover band playing, which even though we were on the other end of the place, could barely hear ourselves talk. We had to basically yell at each other just to converse. Our ears were seriously ringing when we walked out. We're 25 and 32 years old, so it's not exactly like we're old foggies here complaining about loud music.  The food was just so-so. I had the Hawaiian Burger and he had the Roasted Turkey and Bacon Panini. Good, but nothing to write home about.  After we were done, we asked for a box, and finally another server had to go get it for us because ours was MIA. He finally came to give us the check, and went to go get us change. We waited, but he never returned, and while I may have left him more of a tip, we just left, since apparently he didn't seem to care.   It's too bad because this place is right down the street from us and we occasionally like to go to bars to watch a game and grab some food. Will not be returning to this place though.

Tried this place last night after hearing loads of great reviews. Definitely not disappointed. I had a "little" bacon cheeseburger. My fiance had the regular burger with grilled onions and mushrooms and all the rest of the works. Definitely a great burger for the price. Nice that all the toppings are free, compared to some other establishments where you have to pay extra for some of the more premium toppings.   The fries - amazing! We tried both the regular and the cajun. Definitely some of the best fries we've ever had.  2 burgers, split 1 fry, and 2 drinks - almost $20. Okay so not the cheapest, but cheaper than eating at a restaurant and the burgers were pretty nice quality.  Okay all that being said, I wasn't ecstatic to hear how fattening this place was. And also, didn't feel too great afterwards.  Am I crazy to look past all that for the taste of the food? Sadly I think I am. Seriously...so worth it. Not an every day outing, but definitely a nice treat now and then. There's a reason they have been ranked better than In n Out and other places...

I HIGHLY recommend Uptown Bridal for anyone searching for their perfect wedding dress. The staff is really really friendly and helpful. They're all very knowledgeable about the designers and styles they carry. Ali was the one that helped me, and was really patient with me in trying to find my dress - there were two that I couldn't decide between, and she helped me get dressed in them multiple times to compare.  Also, the day of my appointment, there was a parade going on on the main street out front, so they actually called me up the day before to give me a heads up and give me directions to go the back-way - really impressed me before I even went in.   I went to two other boutiques, but there was something missing from the experience at those two places. One had great dresses but not-so-great service. The other was lacking on both the dresses and the customer service.  So I was happy when they fit me in to come back in on a Saturday evening right before closing so I could have one last look. My girl was busy, so the owner of the store actually made room for me and helped me try on the dresses - talk about customer service. I ended up finding the perfect dress and am so excited to go back in for my fitting.  Again...HIGHLY recommend them to anyone shopping for wedding dresses.

I had coupons from the Entertainment Book, so thought, what the heck I'm always down for a deal. However, I don't think I'll be returning to this location. The high school age girls working here had serious attitude both times I went. My fiance asked if the peanut butter sauce was good and she just stared at him and said, "I guess". For the price, the two sundaes we got were so small. There was no outside seating.   There are so many local ice cream shops around town, like Udder Delights, that are so much better (service, value, taste) that we have no need to go here again.

Called them for repair on our stove. Took a bit to hear back to schedule, but they came out and was happy with their service. Seemed like it took them awhile to figure out what was wrong with it, and didn't know what the error number was on my stove, but after some trial and error was able to discover what happened. Also feel it was a bit overpriced - $160 for one little part and labor, but overall was happy with their customer service and to have a working stove again. Rick was really friendly, was quick to get us a replacement part, and worked late at night to get it fixed. Always happy to help support family-run businesses.

When I bought my house, I was told I would have to look forward to some major plumbing issues, which could come with a hefty price tag. I was quoted from another source a very high number, but am I glad I was referred to Hansen's Plumbing Service. They came in, scoped everything out, and gave me an honest idea of what I was looking at. They charged me less than some of the others, and didn't need to tear up my whole front yard like some of the others were suggesting. A year and a half later, no plumbing problems whatsoever. I highly recommend their services - they are honest, fair, experienced and skilled, something you don't find much these days from others in this line of work.

We had a credit from Restaurants.com, so we were searching for a place nearby over the weekend to try out. Craving some sushi, we thought we'd try this place out. It used to be an L&L Hawaiian restaurant and has only been open for a few months - it's located right next to the Starbucks.   Service - Outstanding. It's a family joint, literally, the daughter was our server, the dad was the chef, the brother was taking photos of the food, the mom was working on some operational stuff behind the counter - it doesn't get much more mom-pop shop than this - but of course with a little more swank.   Food - Delicious! Miso soup was so good. Started with their house edamame, yum (although a bit peppery). I had the Vegas Roll - probably the best I've ever had. Hubby had a sampler plate that included a lil bit of everything. He doesn't even normally like rolls (he's much more of a sushi or sashimi guy) but he even agreed my Vegas roll was out of this world. Topped it off with some Tempura ice cream - can it get any better? Oh and plating was beautiful.   Prices - Really not bad - pretty standard for your typical sushi restaurant. Helped that we had the coupon.   Atmosphere - Really warm and welcoming. You could tell there was a table full of some family friends. We were the only other table in there, til another couple came in shortly after, also trying the place out for the first time. So it was a bit slow for a Friday night, but I think it's only because they're so new. Decor was really nice though. Music was a bit loud.   Only con I could see is they didn't serve alcohol, which isn't a big deal because I'm preggo and we're not big drinkers anyways. That could just be because they're in the process of getting their liquor license though, I don't know.   All in all, we will for sure be back here. Without a doubt.

Just came here for the first time this morning after months and months of driving by it wondering what it was like. My son is almost 2 and had a blast. We got there at 10am and it was perfect - a good bunch of kids to play with but not overcrowded like other kid friendly places. The woman at the front (maybe the owner) was super nice and helpful, introduced all the different things there and made us feel very welcome. Best thing - it's only $5!! Can't get better than that. Inside there was a TON to play with for all ages - the big things are the big bounce house, the climbing gym thing and a big plane teeter totter. But they had lots of stuff for the little ones like play stoves, balls, cars and trains, puzzles, books, the list goes on and on. Definitely something for everyone. AND all the toys were very clean and new looking, which was comforting. A lot of the parents hang out in there with the kids or talk with each other. They have a little cafe which we didn't try, but the woman did offer me a cappuccino when i got there which was really cool. They also do lots of themed events each weekend which makes it fun to keep coming back. I already am planning on coming back tomorrow with a few friends!
