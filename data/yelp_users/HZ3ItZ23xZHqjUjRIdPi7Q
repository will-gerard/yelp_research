Totally unassuming place that serves up good food at a good value and offers a decent ambiance. Get the popusas and Salvadoran Tamales. Yum!

Ohhhhh man, that enchilada-style bean & cheese burrito.... I want another one, but probably not for at least a few weeks after the last one -- it was huge. This place had been on my list to try for quite some time, even after I had done the initial scouting and was waiting to develop an appetite for the awesomeness I was promised. I love that the menu is short and sweet and the food almost overwhelming -- both unassuming and carefully prepared in jumbo size. It was just about all I had hoped for, lacking only in unicorns and rainbows, and I love that it exists despite its terrible curb appeal and total lack of ambiance.

Very pretty, but also I think missing several opportunities to provide a greater amount of education about the plants themselves and how they are practically used or planted for landscaping purposes (and yes, I know all about the classes).  A couple months ago, my wife and I decided not to renew our membership to DBG, but it was a wonderful place to take relaxing walks at dusk.... I suppose that next time I get that urge, I'll just sign us back up for a membership -- admission prices are a tad ridiculous.

My wife and I took the couples' yoga and massage class here last Friday night, and thought it was great on so many levels.  There were several people in the class with us, yet it didn't seem too crowded; the instructor and her husband taught us a great deal about both massage and interactive yoga, which was engaging throughout; and finally.... What an awesome date night!  Seriously, we would have easily spent $40 or more having an average experience at any of our typical haunts.  But the payoff for this two hours was far better than any other date we've had recently.  Thank you so much, Desert Song.

The ambiance was amazing, the sparkling wine upon entry is a great touch, and the service was decent (although a bit young and inexperienced overall).  So with all the highlights out of the way, let's get on to my problem with the Wrigley Mansion.  The food was overall good, but not exquisite.  Of the four dishes that we tried, I would have thought we selected from the menu of a $15 per plate neighborhood restaurant, not a $25+ fine dining destination.  Then I ordered the wine, 2004 Rombauer Merlot, a very familiar vintage for me.  It was bad.  Next glass, different bottle, also bad (can't remember what it was, though).  I ended up with a glass of the house wine.  Bad wine is unacceptable for any restaurant, especially when wine can play such an important role in the meal.  Dessert was great, but I only know because I stole a bite from Catherine's plate.  I'm just not a desert guy.  Overall, I would say that yes I will go back as soon as they lower prices and downgrade the ambiance to be more casual, or fix the problems.  Until then, I can think of several better values for fine dining, mostly in the very same area where Wrigley Mansion competes for business.

We've been to some great shows by Ib Anderson and crew and then some that were merely pretty good.  A Midsummer Night's Dream was one of those that I would easily categorize as pretty good -- highly entertaining, but also lacking, perhaps because it was treated as a more minor production than the upcoming Nutcracker (always a big hit).  It seems that each year, Ballet AZ gets noticeably better over the course of the season and this one is no different.  Here's the reason for my lackluster review this time.  It just seemed that the ensemble dance pieces during Friday night's performance were largely neglected and therefore not well coordinated between the performers, yet I happen to know that Ballet AZ has some amazing talent.  Also, there were a few stylistic choices that I thought were bad: Oberon's costuming was a little too effeminate, as was the dancing of the wood nymphs during the first act.  Then in act II, they squandered several huge opportunities for brilliant ensemble pieces as the grand finale.  And everyone knows the tune of Mendelssohn's Wedding March, so why not have a little more fun with it than a very conventional wedding scene?  Despite any of my minor criticism, you will still be happy with a trip to the ballet.  Ib Anderson really has continued making a name for himself with an incredibly fun version of the Nutcracker each year and brilliant performances by his lead dancers.

What a neat place in the center of town! This is unlike any of the other nearby nature centers in that it is surrounded by a beautiful, recently restored, riparian habitat. I attended an event here last month and thought it was an amazing facility for small to medium gatherings. And the surrounding trails are absolutely serene, despite the hustle and bustle of the city in every direction.

Best takeout pizza I've had in a while. It is classic, loaded with herbs and olive oil - just the way I like my late night pizza. Great sauce, crust, cheese. All around a good bet.

Look, this is just fine as a great neighborhood family spot, but it clearly fails as a destination (see parking complaints).  A friend and I used to go here on Saturdays/Sundays after hiking Camelback because he lived in the area.  While I would never travel from afar to go here, I have to admit that I want one near me.  They absolutely get it right, handling a huge volume of brunch orders on weekends and keeping it all moving relatively smoothly with always good food.  Nothing exciting, but good.  Note: the core demographic seems to be shifting to more and more young parents like ourselves.  So I wouldn't advise bringing your hangover here to encounter the screaming babies.  Also, please don't glare at me over the rim of your paper coffee cup because I look like I just went hiking.  It's a freakin' grocery store with a cafe in it!  Get over yourself.

My only direct experience with these guys was when I ordered flowers for my wife's anniversary present.  My initial conversation with the owner was very promising, in which he said that he could gladly make it a small and simply elegant bouquet, featuring purple to match our wedding flower colors, and involving a lot of reassuring yeses (picturing head-nodding as well).  But instead, after charging about $60, they delivered a generic looking arrangement of white flowers that I probably could have found at Safeway for $15.  I love supporting local businesses -- only if they are reliable enough to deliver on promises.  Not sure about going back here again.

We looked this place up on our way to our friends' house in the area and decided to give it a shot. Four out of four of us thought it was excellent. Great sauce, great crust, and fresh toppings. Plus, I love what they've done in such a tiny little shop space. This struck me immediately as an independent little neighborhood joint with pride of ownership. I just wish it was easier to spot when driving by.

My 4-star review is based solely on Terminal 4.  Terminal 3 might be worthy of 3 stars, although it's been years since I've used it, Terminal 2 is definitely only worth 2 stars, and Terminal 1 probably only gets 1 star for being either non-existent or closed to the public.  Here's my take on Terminal 4: A couple great food options -- I prefer the little Mexican Food restaurant by the D gates, or else I'll usually just try to grab something at Paradise before heading through security.  I try to stay away from all the HMS Host places except for the little walk-up burrito window, but when I really need a drink, I just remember that a beer/whiskey combo is the best value.  When traveling on business, I love the fact that I can park right above the terminal, hop on an elevator, and be at my gate in a few minutes.  When traveling with the family, however, I think the off-property parking businesses do a far better job of getting you to Terminal 4 in a hurry. Never again will I use the airport's long term parking (although, I would still consider it at Terminal 2 because it's so convenient).  If I were a tourist, I would be thrilled at the fact that Sky Harbor has a Heard Museum-affiliated gift shop and an AZ Highways shop in Terminal 4.  These are my favorite places to get genuine AZ stuff.

Phoenix has no history, you say?  Please, hurry thee to Pueblo Grande for an explanation about our canal system and the historical significance of the Hohokam (fascinating story) as well as others who have since adapted to living in this desert.  In my opinion, no one tells the story better than Pueblo Grande, complete with the actual on-site ruins, and you're almost guaranteed to learn lots of neat stuff even if you already thought you knew everything.  We've gone a couple of times in the last month or so, once to wander through the museum and once for the native market.  Each was a blast, and the food at the native market was awesome!  Given the incredibly convenient location of Pueblo Grande, I hope we go back often.  I remember really liking this place as a kid -- I shouldn't have waited so long to go back.

Gotta take this opportunity to thank Nick A.  He's been there since the shop opened and this is the second time I've dealt with him.  Both times have been a pleasure, as he is just very pleasant and not interested in the typical high-pressure sales style that I've come to expect from chain auto shops.  I hate to say it, but I'm sure I'll be back again for new tires.....

This is definitely one of my favorite groceries, and I always have a fun time here.  One previous reviewer likened it to Disneyland, which is spot on -- it's like a big extravaganza of fresh foods and pantry items.  And yes, I too prefer the produce at Ranch Market to many other stores, although we're now getting more of our through Bountiful Baskets.  So now my best excuses to trek over to Ranch Market are to buy hard-to-find ingredients, fresh cheeses, and maybe enjoy a fabulous taco while picking up those other items.

How often do you see fruit stands on the roadside anymore? Not much in Phoenix. But Summer's Fruit Barn serves that role excellently, as Lisa the owner has maintained relationships throughout the area to get fresh fruits and veggies, as well as other goodies, at great prices. On my last visit she even taught me how to sort through the huge batches of AZ sweet oranges (the reason for my visit, looking on behalf of a friend). She peeled a few to demonstrate how to spot light to moderate frost damage, and then hand selected a few pounds of her best specimens. I love having this place nearby.

I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review of El Mesquite. It's one of those neighborhood standbys that you love having around. We've eaten takeout several times and been thrilled with the carne asada, carnitas, and more. And while we've tried it several times already, I'll add that it could easily have been twice as many or more. But their hours are a frequent source of frustration. How does a restaurant surrounded by a mostly residential area close every night at 7:00 and have otherwise seemingly arbitrary hours? Given that it's family-owned, I give them a pass and will return again. Just make sure you call ahead if coming from a distance.

I complained recently that there were no local takeout pizza places nearby, to which several friends responded that I was nuts. "Have you tried Gino's?!?!" they asked..... I promised that I would get there ASAP and finally did so tonight. I had my in-laws over and we all agreed that it was generally very good. I don't know that I'm a fan of the crust, but there's not much of it and I am a fan of that. Plus, I was impressed to find tasty fresh red onions on our veggie pizza (weird that this simple ingredient is remarkable, but it was), and overall good toppings with slightly above average sauce. I vow to immediately stop ordering from the chain place around the corner unless I'm really desperate -- all future business goes to Gino's when I'm in the neighborhood and looking for takeout. And there's also a decent little area for dining in, including arcade, but who knows when we'll ever make the time to stay. Maybe if there's ever a band on the stage?

When we first discovered Southside Animal Hospital, it was purely out of necessity: the nearby Laveen Animal Hospital could not get us in for an appointment, and I had become dissatisfied with some of the more familiar Tempe vets I used to use.  So when we made an appointment at Southside for our newly adopted german shepard, I was a little guarded at first -- thinking of some of the negative experiences I'd had in the past.  Next, upon walking in the door, I saw two great signs of a positive experience: almost no wait (yes, I know this could mean good or bad things), and walls adorned with thank-you's and information about the Phoenix Police K-9 unit and their trainers.  We found a vet with tons of experience with this sometimes difficult breed!  And the experience with staff and the doctor were as pleasant as could be.  We could tell that this was an established and valuable neighborhood business that didn't charge too much or promote silly add-on services like many vets now do.  Since that experience a couple of years ago, we have consistently chosen Southside for all our vet needs -- even getting rid of the Banfield wellness plans we had for our cats in favor of these guys.

This place gets an easy four stars for being a good spot to catch bands, grab some decent (but appropriately greasy) bar food, and enjoy an always decent drink selection. The extra star is for the owners, particularly Ross, who have done so much for local music over the years and have not received nearly enough gratitude for it. My bands played here when I was younger, I saw plenty of amazing shows here, and I still try to stop in when I'm on that side of town for an easygoing time playing pool and drinking beers. Truly an awesome small bar venue.

This was supposed to be the highlight of an otherwise disappointing evening in Mesa, but it too let us down. I ordered the pad thai and my wife ordered another noodle dish, both with tofu. Neither was prepared such that the noodles would pick up much of the sauce and the vegetables were equally overcooked, so we struggled at first to figure out which was which. Both of us literally commented, "meh". I would perhaps come back, but only after drinking.

I happened to be in the area and needing help with a bad power cord, so I figured I'd try stopping in here.  I had no idea that for a simple customer service issue, I should have called ahead and made an appointment....  So I walked in, went straight to the Genius Bar, and looked for an available employee.  Then I saw a young woman, apparently on her way out, still talking to some other customers.  In a hurry to be acknowledged by a uniformed staff member and on my way, I got her attention and asked what to do.  She very graciously walked me over to the computers where you can make an appointment on the spot and advised that I pick an appointment for iPhone, iPad, or iPod, rather than my MacBook Pro, because it really doesn't matter and it would be much faster. I did this, then said thank you, and she left.  As I waited patiently and wasted away a half hour staring at the list of names, I started wondering why my name hadn't yet been called -- or if I missed it.  Then I looked up and *poof* my name was gone.  Luckily, one of the reps was idle and I was able to ask what was going on.  His response was basically, "tsk, tsk, tsk, it's obviously your fault.  Now go stand in the losers corner across the store and someone may or may not come and talk to you about your problem.  But too bad you didn't catch our representative whispering your name amidst the din."  So I waited with the other losers like myself for fifteen minutes or so, until another employee came out to find me.  He explained that whoever told me to pick an appointment for whatever is fastest was actually quite wrong (and I'm pretty sure his eyes told me to go to hell for lying).  Then, he denied any knowledge of the power cord recall and tried to tell me that I was probably screwed.  Thankfully, I had the URL for Apple's FAQ about the recall.  After a quick check with the manager, I was told it would only be another ten minutes or so of paperwork to get me out of there.  So..... I spent well over an hour and had to overcome misinformation and poor service in order to take care of a rather simple component recall issue (one that, if not solved, could have eventually burned my house down).  I'm not sure whether to think this is more indicative of Apple's general decline or if this store just sucks. Either way, I won't be returning to this location any time soon.

I've been working on a project down the street from this business and therefore found it to be a wonderful place to meet off property or just stop in to grab something.  But please do not be misled by the name in thinking that this is anything of a market.  I'd question whether the owners really know what they want it to be, which is a common complaint from me when visiting these upscale "market" cafes.  But so be it.... here's my take on the experience:  Visit #1: Morning coffee meeting before heading into the office.  I was thrilled by the way the owners have renovated this old space.  Furthermore, it was a quick and comfortable experience for my morning coffee needs.  Coffee was pretty good too.  Visit #2: Lunch meeting with colleagues.  There were six of us, which posed a seating challenge in the busy restaurant at first, but then an employee/manager noticed us and helped out.  I ordered the Arizona Sky, which was a tasty ham sandwich, and enjoyed a wonderful sweet potato salad on the side.  The sandwich, with a cup of coffee, was roughly $9 if memory serves correctly.  While quite tasty, I hope the lunch prices come down as more worthy competition enters the market.  So, overall, great place for an occasional change of pace, but not something I'd do frequently.   Visit #3: Another coffee meeting.  This time, I was feeling a little like having a snack, so I thought it was great that we were in a "market."  And this is when I remembered that this place is not really a market at all.  Yes, that's what I thought was off about this place -- I knew something wasn't clicking for me.  So in summary, I'd say that this is a nice little breakfast/lunch restaurant, but not quite what I wanted it to be based on its name or history.  And hey, yet another interesting take on the classic casual cafe/diner vibe will only help this genre of restaurant move forward in Arizona, so I'll keep tabs and look forward to trying it again.

I don't know what it is about Tempe Sales, but how can you not love them? it is primarily a fabric store, and they may or may not have all kinds of other random stuff, like carved wooden chairs, stone tabletops, bamboo flooring (sadly no longer in stock), slate tiles, and so on.  However, I would say that it's not merely the random selection of home decorating supplies and upholstery tools/materials that makes Tempe Sales great. It's the family-run vibe that you get from them. On one trip, to pick up several cases of flooring material, I had to go with the owner Alan to his warehouse down the street. In light of buying as much as I did and helping pull it from the warehouse, he threw in plenty of sublayment material for free (otherwise on closeout). The staff (many of whom are part of the family) have also helped me reupholster furniture and work on plenty of other odd jobs. There is no shame in being an amateur at Tempe Sales, even though it is primarily geared toward professionals.  If you're in the market for fabric, please do yourself a favor and check it out. I bet that you will return soon thereafter just to browse around some more. The only downsides that come to mind also make the experience more interesting -- stock levels are not always reliable and parts of the store have historically been disorganized (much better now than in the past), but my experience may be skewed since I gravitate toward closeout deals.

This one is a great neighborhood bar.  After moving away a few years ago, I don't feel nearly as at home here anymore (not to mention, it's the type of bar best walked to from the nearby neighborhood), but it's good to see that they still have the classic juke box and usually have plenty of open pool tables.  Great place to relax over a beer.

Hadn't been here in a while.  I remember the decline from absolutely classic in the 80's-90's to quite mediocre in recent years.  But I must say, Top of the Rock is back.  The ambiance has always been spectacular.  Service has been mostly good.  But the food is the part that is clearly making a come-back.  We have gone here a few times recently, most notably for the well known champagne brunch, and had a great time.  Just beware that the brunch is all-you-can eat, and there's a great selection from the omelet bar to the raw bar to the always underrated pastries.  Maybe a hike around the property after your feast?

Always there and (almost) always reliable, Seamus McCaffrey's is still my favorite place to grab a beer downtown.  Last Friday night, I convinced a couple of friends that we ought to go check out the newly burgeoning night life in downtown Phoenix, since they had both moved away in recent years.  So after being thoroughly un-wowed by the Roosevelt row area, we decided to head back to our favorite old standby, Seamus.  My only complaint was an out-of-order men's room, which gets a pass for being in a known old building and for the bouncer explaining our other options politely and immediately.  After all, what's an Irish pub without a pisser?  Thankfully, still a pretty good Irish pub in this case.

Let's start with noting that this was the setting for mine and Catherine's first date together, as well as our engagement party with friends, and several fun but casual experiences dining out over the years.  We once raved about this place and went often.  Then, when the manager refused to work with me on hosting a large family party there, I tried to boycott My Florist for a while.  Friends did the same.  But we couldn't stay away form the reliably good sandwiches on tasty bread,  half-priced wine bottles, and wonderful desserts.  But sadly, the last couple of times we went to My Florist, the food was so-so, service was mediocre, and our favorite pianist is no longer there!  I think the real reason for my two-star review is the fact that the pianist is gone.  It made me realize that all the greatest decorations cannot make up for a declining overall experience.  Perhaps I'll revisit this later, but for now it gets two stars.

We have been quite impressed with Dr. Berger ever since our son was born and a family friend recommended him.  He gives very sensible advice and typically offers his perspective in a flexible tone, expressing a specific range of views whenever we face an ambiguous problem.  This is relieving to me, especially in an era that we can google all our medical issues and all but self-diagnose (rightly or wrongly).  Dr. Berger is always very patient, even for the conversations that begin with, "I looked this up online and...."  I'd definitely recommend this practice to a friend.

My membership has expired and I haven't been in a while, but I always really liked this place.  I used to go a couple times a week, mostly in the late afternoons and was almost always surrounded by off-duty law enforcement officers (or sometimes on-duty).  This, to me, is like finding an ethnic restaurant filled mostly with people of that ethnicity.  How could it be bad?  Sure enough, I've always been satisfied.  Only a couple of items make me notch it down to four stars from five.  Here's one: on ladies nights, or at other busy times, you may have to wait to get on the range (unless you have an elite membership, which I did).  And another, really just so that you know what to expect:  Shooters World specializes in self-defense hand guns, home defense shot guns, and assault rifles.  So don't expect much else in stock unless they maybe have something used. Even if you just want a basic 870 for multi-purpose use, you'd be better off at an outdoors store or Wal-Mart.  But the short-barreled modified 870?  Shooters World or bust.  Same goes for other black guns.  Now back to the clear and obvious benefits of this place.  Their range is very safe, and other shooters tend to be respectful and safe as well (although I've often seen rental cars in the parking lot from Californians eager to hold assault rifles....).  Also, if you get a membership, they have great perks, like discounts and free firearms transfers.  And finally, they've always had ammo in stock.  So during that ridiculous ammo shortage last year, when I still wanted to sometimes shoot my .40 and other popular calibers, I could always buy a box at the range for a fair price.  And finally, the staff and owners are great -- they've even agreed to let us use their instruction space for a neighborhood gun club workshop.  If you need a central location to shoot or just browse the inventory, this should be it.

How could anyone give this place a bad review!  Actually, this location (Campus for Compassion) is truly magnificent.  If you walk in expecting the typical animal shelter with depressing crowds of people waiting to abandon/euthanize/adopt their pets, then you will be blow away by this campus.  We adopted our lovely dog here, as well as shopped for one of our cats.  The staff is great, and they provide great facilities to meet and greet your future family members.  I've never seen a nicer shelter.  Point of clarification: this is only an adoption center, not a place to drop off rescued animals.  At least that's what I remember being told when we had a batch of stray kittens last year.

There just aren't enough old school feed stores like this one anymore. I go there to buy straw, primarily, but they have all kinds of other fun stuff and it's a great place to run into some of the locals who have lived here a lot longer than I have. Yesterday, a guy came in after me and bought a ridiculous amount of rabbit pellets. That's the sort of thing I need in my day sometimes.

It's not a super classy joint, by any means, but it is definitely what I think a neighborhood bar should be, if it were on steroids.  Sports bar, pool hall, dart boards, pub grub, video games, and a tremendously average crowd.  Sometimes crowded, but the staff appeared to keep up pretty well.

This is one of my old Scottsdale standbys.  The mushroom dish is great, the wine list expansive, and the food consistently good.  My only concern is that the last few visits have revealed that the menu is rather static.  We have always had a good experience here, but Cowboy Ciao was initially known as a refreshing alternative to the expensive yet mediocre restaurants that otherwise plague Scottsdale.  I hope they get back to that someday.

They tow customers' cars! Seriously, I got there at 8:45 pm to meet up with my cousin while he was in town, had a couple of beers inside, and then walked out at 10:30 to find that my car was missing. I had parked on the end of the other cars, which was not a space, so my first guess was that it had been towed.... Yup.  I found the phone number for the towing company on a sign on the wall of the establishment and called them. They had no record of having towed my car. Then I walked over to ask a bouncer and he confirmed that my car had been towed. I asked why, and he said that it was because I was parked improperly. I responded, "but I'm your customer and you guys went straight to towing?!" He said that he felt bad about it, but yes. Then he told me I could get the number for the towing company from the other bouncer. I called the number he gave me, and a young woman answered with a simple hello. "Uhhh, is this a towing company?"  She responded that she worked for a towing company. "Okay, I'm looking for my car and was given your number," I said. She then told me that she would text me the towing company number.... and it was the same number that I had previously called. Brilliant.   I called the towing company again. Yes, they had my car and no I could not have it back -- not right now, anyway. They open tomorrow morning at 8:00. I must bring $90 to get my car back. This absolutely sucks.  So let's back up a little bit. I picked Coach House because I thought it would be a good spot to escape the obnoxiousness that is more typical of the Scottsdale club scene and enjoy a beer in a laid back environment. But I guess it's the holidays.... the older cougars were out hunting and the staff were generally unpleasant. Then my car got towed. The end. That is the last $90 that Coach House ever gets out of me, so I hope their cut was worth it.

I love this place because it combines so many things I dig: sandwiches, Italianism, a great wine selection, and an overall nice casual atmosphere. If I had a market, I'm pretty sure it would be like this one if I could help it.  The one critical thing I would add is that next time I'm craving DeFalco's on a Saturday at around noon, I think I'll call in the order. It's a rather popular place for lunch.

Here's another review that is far too late.  I've been a regular at Pita Jungle for well over 15 years, countless friends have worked there, and I've even gone to holiday parties at the home of one of the owners.  These guys are a Tempe mainstay, in my opinion -- particularly this location, which is the original.  I'm pretty sure the menu has changed very little in all the time I've gone to Pita Jungle (except for about 10 years ago when they opened the Chandler restaurant and got a beer/wine license -- had to add some more dinner appropriate fare), but this is okay with me.  Anymore, I'm almost always happy with the Mediterranean platter or the chicken schwarma platter.  Sometimes I'll change it up, but I always get the hummus.  Great hummus.  Seriously.

Took some friends here the other night, following the Tempe Oktoberfest, and had the big platter (plenty for four of us).  It was tasty, as always, and I think the newbies enjoyed it as well.  For those concerned about trying this cuisine for the first time, just imagine that it's like Italian meets Indian food.  At least that worked for us.  Definitely check this out.

If your goal is to eat stuff, but avoid a place that serves meat, then this is your spot.  However, if you seek decent food that holds up to comparison with actual restaurants rather than your high school cafeteria, then you may be disappointed.  This is truly mediocre, yet totally veg, fare.

I can't believe I never before wrote a review of Haji-Baba.  I've literally been going here with varying regularity for most of my life.  I have probably tried most of the menu and never ever had a bad experience, but will admit that I probably fall back on the falafel sandwich more than half the time I go to Haji-Baba.  It really is the best falafel in town.  Additional tip, pick up some decadent baklava (several varieties) or other freshly made Mediterranean pastries and a package of the best pitas in town, along with some other ethnic groceries on your way out.  My promise: you will be happy to know about this place once you try it out.

I'm not usually a fan of Chicago-style pizzas.  However, Spinato's was definitely different from any that I've tried, and the crust is quite tasty, the cheese high quality, and the sauce pretty good too -- if a bit unique.  For my office, I ordered a sausage pizza, along with a cheese and a veggie (mushroom, onion, pepper); all were fantastic.  I then took home the leftovers and made it an all-pizza kind of day.  Definitely the best takeout I've had in quite a while, but I think the sweetness of the sauce might get old over time.

My local alumni association needed a place for a gathering last weekend and someone chose Monti's. I initially resisted based on past experience, but ultimately went along with the plan. The negotiated rate was $50 per head, which would have been reasonable for a nice restaurant. But Monti's is the same drab place it was last time I went there. Service was decent, but food was mediocre.... yet again. Same bland but salty white bread and same love of salt on everything else including the meat. Every time I end up at Monti's, it's someone else's decision and I regret it every time. I'd much rather go to one of the many quality steak restaurants in town.

This is my favorite neighborhood Italian restaurant.  The prices are fair and the dishes are always tasty and plentiful.  The same regulars have been going here for the last 12 years or so, which makes it pretty hard to skimp on quality.  Unfortunately, I've moved from the area, but we still try to stop by and see Papa and family whenever possible.

Seriously, there should be no debate about this.  If you live in Tempe/Chandler, this is likely your favorite Italian restaurant.  I've moved away from the area, yet it's still my favorite, and I try to make the trip back whenever my wife and I are craving Italian.  At risk of sounding like a broken record here, the complimentary bruscetta at the beginning of the meal is a tasty and classy offering.  Otherwise, just sit down and enjoy the wonderful casual Southern Italian fare.  Also, as previously noted, feel free to ask for something prepared a little differently than on the menu.  For instance, one of my favorite orders is the bowtie prima vera in a red sauce, fra diavaola. Not sure if that's the proper name for the dish, but again, this place is casual enough that I don't need to sweat it.  Great food in a great setting!

This has become my favorite bar in Laveen again.  They were once the only game in town, and now that we have several other choices I would choose this one.  They have a great jukebox if you like classic country and the like, as well as pool tables, a decent whiskey selection, and a patio for smokers and video game players.  Plus, they have semi-enjoyable karaoke on Friday/Saturday nights.  The only thing I found lacking is a good premium beer selection.  And a huge crowd.  Aside from that, they need only to turn down the lights a little, and this will be the perfect neighborhood hole-in-the-wall bar.  Oh btw, I think it's also cash only, which is annoying.

It's been several months since my last visit and I still recall the flavors of the individual ingredients on my pizza.  Amazing!  (ummmm, especially after polishing off a bottle of wine or two while waiting).  There's a reason I won't go here more than once a year or so.  I refuse to wait several hours to be seated at any restaurant. It makes no sense for the customer that Bianco won't take reservations.  Our only recourse.... follow the advice of others here and go find a better way to spend your waiting time than spending money on wine and appetizers.  But seriously, the pizza is amazing and memorable.

I would have given Durant's a fifth star, except that the quality has declined in recent years and I must punish them for that.  Durant's is nonetheless a classic.  I miss the great times dining here with my grandfather when he was still around.  He could always point out the notable lawyers and politicos at dinner time, and I could tell that he enjoyed carrying on his tradition as much as I enjoyed playing a part in it.  What also used to be.... truly exceptional service!  It's still great, but I have the fondest memories of the last generation of wait staff.  They always recognized the regulars even if we hadn't been there for several months.  Likewise, they would often remember our regular orders.  This place practically defined classy dining for me as I was growing up, which is why I've always gone there for birthdays.  In more recent years, I admit I've been less loyal, although it appears that others are keeping them busy enough in the mean time.  But I recently learned a new way to enjoy Durant's on a budget.  A few weeks ago, I took some clients there for lunch and had yet another great experience.  The menu revolves around burgers at lunch time, which I wouldn't dream of ordering for dinner, but they are indeed tasty.  I think I will be back soon for another lunch, if not dinner and cocktails as well.

Great NM-style food.  I think I've been to nearly every location, including the original in Springerville, and this is the best.  I've been here many times and had only one iffy experience at Los Dos: the food was mediocre and (gasp) NOT TOO SPICY when we went several months ago.  But don't worry, we just went again a few weeks ago, and all is well.  I ordered my usual cheese enchiladas with fried egg on top and enjoyed a Bohemia beer to help wash down the hot salsa and spicy enchilada sauce.  Yes, I will return.  And I recommend the same for you.  Just remember that on busy Friday/Saturday nights, you can expect to enjoy several margaritas in the courtyard as you wait to be seated.  They take no reservations and this is a popular gem in the South Mountain area.

There's not enough parking onsite for cars or butts on a Saturday night, but I'm willing to let that slide. We parked on a nearby street and managed to find a spot near our friends' table.  Then, the fun began. I asked the waitress for a glass of Jameson on the rocks. She seemed stressed, and like she was juggling a million open tabs at the time, so I told her I'd pay in cash. I meant to make it easier on her.

Good stuff, I guess, but high prices and incredibly rude service on my last visit to this location.  In the service industry, I'd argue that service accounts for about 80% of the score.  I won't be supporting Tammie Coe until I feel confident that this issue has been addressed -- especially since I never felt that it was spectacular anyway.  And add another vote for way too much frosting as well.  No, I do not care to pay $25 for your tiny sugar bomb of a cake.  I could get one much cheaper and with a smile from the Basha's bakery if I wanted.

We went to Olive & Ivy for our third time a couple weeks ago with friends.  Each experience has been different, and I must say that this place needs to make up its mind.  Is it a trendy nighttime dining establishment or a casual grocery cafe?  I prefer the latter, although the restaurant seems to punish me for it.  Granted there are great menu selections and the food has been reliably good.  But the prices are high, the service mediocre, and the interior design more fitting of a Vegas night club.  I would never make this a first choice, although I also try not to complain if dragged there.

My favorite restaurant at Sky Harbor.....  I've been meaning to check out the original El Bravo location in Phoenix, as I've been so happy with this little counter-service airport version of it.  They really have a great selection of burritos and other fast casual Mexican food items.  Even the bean and cheese burrito is tasty!  (Everyone who knows me knows that this is probably the first thing I'll try at any casual Mexican restaurant).  It was the perfect delivery mechanism for El Bravo's rich salsa roja (the red stuff).  El Bravo is an all around good place, and it's leaps and bounds above the rest of the chain options in the airport.  One little nitpicky note about this place..... I'm pretty sure the prices have gone up recently.  They didn't seem exorbitant, but competitive, which was a huge disappointment.  This place used to be pretty cheap.

This has been one of my pricier dining experiences in the Phoenix, but also the most rewarding.  Where else can you show up to dinner wearing flip flops and shorts (not quite the norm, but acceptable) and try some of the most delicately prepared dishes featuring local produce/meats and paired with a great wine list--and then simply enjoy yourself in a relaxed environment.  I'm a huge fan of all the dining concepts at The Farm, but Quiessence clearly stands out as one of my favorite places here or anywhere (and yes, I dine out a lot for work and pleasure).  As a slow food restaurant, Quiessence places a strong emphasis on enjoying each and every part of the a la carte menu.  And the servers are professional and uniquely helpful in offering their advice about the selections.  On one visit, I inquired about the local vegetable platter and the server told me she would have to ask the kitchen because each platter is prepared to the chef's choosing on the spot.  Having no allergies or other concerns, I happily told her to forget it.  This is the one restaurant in Phoenix where you should let the chef make as many choices for you as possible.  If you have not yet tried Quiessence, I insist that this is the absolute best that Phoenix has to offer right now for an elegant or simply delectable but casual dinner.

Maybe if I lived in the same neighborhood, I'd dig this dark little old house as a casual off-property meetup spot.  Otherwise, I'll put all my hipster cred on the line by saying that this place is rather unimpressive.  Last weekend, I convinced a couple of friends who had moved away from PHX in recent years that the downtown area is much improved and not a bad place to hang out on a Friday night.  But oh what a poor example this bar was.  It's dark and tough to see from the street, the inside is somewhat cool looking but basically uninviting, and the front gate area is crowded with smokers because there is no other place for them.  This probably explains the rather meager crowd we observed there....  Granted, this trip was better than a couple years ago when I would have complained that it was too crowded and seating is rather awkward.  But I think that just illustrates the fact that this place is overall an unnatural bar setting.  Maybe it was meant to be a cafe instead, where at least the food would distract you from the dullness.

I'm biased.  Not only do I admire all that Kimber Lanning (owner) has done for the Phoenix community, and more specifically its music scene, but this record store is also my favorite one among many that I've visited throughout the western states.  Fifteen years ago, I bought most of my 7" records at Stinkweeds, and now I still go for CDs and community.  The staff is awesome, as is the selection.  There was this one time that they didn't have a rare import album I wanted.... not that any other store was likely to have it either....  so Kimber told me to check back in a couple of days.  Voila!  She ordered it just for me.  I dare you to find such great service in any other music store these days, or most other retail establishments for that matter.  Stinkweeds just rocks, that's all.  Word to the wise: if it's your first visit, drive west from Central and look for the parking lot entrance near HTC, which is on the east side of the building.  Easy to miss if you're driving by.

I might go there again, but I really don't need crappy pizza that badly.  I was initially excited that we had a quality independent pizza place nearby, but Duner's is nothing of the sort.  By making chitchat with the staff, I learned that none of them have ever met the owners, which no longer surprised me after trying the truly mediocre food that I took home.  If this were an owner-run establishment, I'd like to think it would be quite different.

I guess I'm just being a big softy, in that I'm revising my review of Duner's to reflect that it is indeed better than Domino's, Pizza Hut, and Little Ceasar's -- our only other nearby options.  But that's like saying, please shoot me in the leg rather than the gut or the head.  That said, I think my expectations of pizza are rising with age.  If this were near my college apartment, I probably would have loved Duner's.  They do have crap beer on tap, which is a great accompaniment to crappy za......  and they achieve their stated mission of making and selling food that is edible.  Bravo, Duners!

This is a wonderful branch library with a large meeting room that works for most meetings and a decent selection of media.  In fact, my wife and I recently discovered that the library is a great place to supplement our NetFlix subscription.  My only wish is that they had made it bigger.

Best dive bar in the area. I really wish that they offered something besides Bud and Bud Light on tap, but this is also one of those places where you don't exactly expect to get exactly what you want, and that's okay. I think they call it character -- this bar has it.

The pizza was talked up by at least a couple of friends, but I'm not seeing it. It's not too bad, but also no better than the chain places. Therefore, I didn't feel that it was a very good value. We ordered takeout with family, and the vote was a unanimous "meh".... crust wasn't very good, everything else was simply okay. If I lived right around the corner, I might end up here just to support the locals, but I'm definitely not making the effort to come back -- at least not for pizza.

This was absolutely the best value for many reasons, when we chose it last weekend....  Walking distance to light rail, convenient central location for my friends catching spring training games in PHX and elsewhere....  But then it failed in the free wifi department.   We were all getting together for our annual fantasy baseball draft and found that the internet service was dreadfully slow and unreliable at this hotel.  Plus, I talked my friends out of paying more for the aloft because of its tiny rooms, but then found that the room they got at this hotel was also rather old-school small.  So, if you're stopping in late at night on your way to catching a morning flight, then this is probably a great landing spot.  Otherwise, you may want to consider trying one of the many other nearby properties.

I remember when this Costco was the one I loved, but I have since moved on.... Apparently the chain has deemed this one less deserving of certain premium items that were temporarily available at other Costco stores, namely the Kirkland label scotch and port, as well as several other items in the same category.  If only I had known, I would have grabbed the scotch at whatever other store I recently visited.  But instead I decided to wait until going to this store last night.  No dice.  Also, on another visit, they hassled me about a costco.com return.  Sorry, but I'm accustomed to better from my beloved warehouse store.  Be cursed, Tempe Costco.  I will find solace in the loving embrace of another location.

The menu here is great, even if unspectacular.  The pizzas are probably the mainstay of this place, so we'll start there: good crust, average sauce, and a decent balance of flavors.  However, I must add that last time we went, both Catherine and I struggled to understand why they would put figs and prosciutto on a red-sauce pizza for their special....... the tomato/herb combo sort of over-powered the delicate sweetness of the fig.  Ordinarily, I must compliment the chef for attention to balanced flavors.  The salad menu is great--although I've gotten a little bored with it over the years.  And the entrees have usually been great as well.  I recall a great orzo dish that I tried some time back.  Finally, I must comment that although it's been a while, we really appreciated the fresh fish specials on the menu.  Last fall, I think we dined at Amano's almost weekly and got a seafood dish each time.  It was great every time.  However, our last trip, Catherine ordered a cioppino dish that left much to be desired.  We may have hit it on an off night, given that our only bad experiences were on the same visit.  Otherwise, this is everything that I expect of a popular neighborhood eatery.    *** One more thing: I hope that they've gotten rid of the tacky fat cherub paintings that adorn the walls.  Normally, Amano rotates the artwork, but these paintings were there for at least the last several months.  Otherwise, the ambience is great.

This is one of my regular spots for breakfast when entertaining or meeting up with friends.  It's the perfect place to go after a morning hike on South Mountain to fill up on some of the richest (or simple, if you prefer) breakfast/brunch selections you will find.  Seriously, I'm not into it, but the french toast monte christo sandwich is an amazing fix for the heart-attack prone.  The setting is absolutely unassuming and casual, with plastic chairs and self-serve coffee.  And yes, it is on a farm with 100% outdoor seating.  There's even an occasional breeze that may blow mesquite leaves onto your plate.  But if this sort of encounter somehow does not relax you, or even bothers you, then I suggest going next door for a wonderful massage at the spa.  Seriously, this is what you need on a casual weekend morning, before heading back into a stressful work week on Monday.  Go here if you haven't already.

I had almost never trusted off-property parking businesses after a few bad experiences with the logistics in the past.  However, The Parking Spot proved to be a great option for our last trip.  I'm pretty sure they got us to terminal 4 much faster than the airport's own shuttles.  Two important notes about pricing: 1. Always get a coupon, as I've learned you can almost always find one. 2. They charge a flat daily rate, so do the math to see if you're better off with daily + hourly somewhere else or just going with the flat daily rate.

I like the beers, I like the ambiance, and it turns out this place has decent pub grub too. The only issue I have is the location (and therefore ambiance, in some respects). The Rose and Crown can be a little hit or miss sometimes and I don't easily think of it when trying to find a mellow pub environment to grab beers with friends. However, this is exactly the kind of place I'd love to have near home or work for such a purpose. It's just a classic pub in a classy historic setting, which is a rare find.

Questionable choice of location and aforementioned snarkiness aside, try Cartel if you *heart* coffee, and I seriously doubt you'll have a negative experience.  I had the pleasure of discussing the beans with one of the owners/managers and got no attitude, yet it turned into a lengthy discussion about single-source coffees and roasting/grinding/brewing standards.  These guys simply love their coffee and are on a mission to share the good stuff with their customers.  Gotta love it.  That said, I can't help but laugh at the story about the caramel cappuccino -- and yeah, I'd probably react the same way.  While I was fortunate to want nothing more than the traditional cup of joe, I did smile at one of the many snarky cardboard signs off to the side of the counter that read something like, "To avoid ridicule and disappointment, please refrain from ordering a mocha."  Hey, just because it's a coffee shop doesn't mean that they need to offer the same exact formulaic menu as others in the business.  For what it's worth, this is the only stuff we drink at home now, after trying it first at the PHX Public Market, and then in a gift basket from ZonieBaskets.  I will hopefully never again buy the bulk stuff from Costco/TJ's, which was once my naive preference.

I was looking for a cafe, just hoping I'd remembered correctly that one was in this location.  So I stopped in, thinking, "meh, someone else opened a coffee shop.  Whatever.  Let's see if I can camp out and get a little work done."  But as I walked in, I found that this place already has a decent following -- several happy customers sitting around.  And then, the owner/manager(?) saw me as he was working on something for another customer.  And this is when I became truly impressed with this place.   He said hello, and then followed that he'd be able to take my order in about a minute.  And he did.  I ordered just a regular coffee, light/medium roast, which is my typical order at a coffee shop.  His response was something along the lines of, "Great, I'll get that for you in just a few minutes.  We should probably brew a new pot."  And then the kicker -- he noticed my leather satchel and inquired whether I'd been here before.  I said no, and he followed with a warm welcome and advice on how to get electricity and wifi for my computer.  Truly an all-around warm experience.  It's amazing what a little bit of good customer service can do to make the customer happy.  But that isn't all.  This establishment only uses locally sourced coffees and teas, and they take pride in the quality.  Also important, the decor and ambience are great at this place, as is the music selection, the library of books, the seating arrangement, and the overall concept.  It's attached to a boutique on one side and a hair salon on the other, with people migrating back and forth the entire time I was here.  This is definitely a place I look forward to returning.  And it's a much needed service for this neighborhood.

This place was pretty shoddy looking - like it hasn't had a deep cleaning in a while. Everything was crammed into the tiny space and looked like it hadn't moved in years.  So of course I decided to order my son an ice cream cone.... a very ordinary yet expensive ice cream cone. He then needed napkins, lots of them, because the store was warm and his ice cream was rapidly melting; not that we'd stick around anyway, given that there were only two chairs to be found and one was occupied by my friend whose idea it was to go here. Needless to say, I won't be back if I can help it.

I first discovered Queen Creek Olive Mill several years ago, after taking a huge detour on the way home from Tucson.  This was before the grounds were as nice as they are now, but we enjoyed going into the large steel shed and trying several of their olive oils (not too different an experience from some of my favorite small wineries).  They were good, but then I didn't feel that I had a solid frame of reference at the time.  So... after at first grimacing at what I thought was a high price, I decided to take a bottle home and taste test it against other premium selections from around the world.  Hands down, QC olive Oil was the best on many levels, and generally more affordable than its competitors (not to mention an entirely awesome local product).  So while I still use the cheap stuff from Costco occasionally in cooking, this is admittedly the only brand of olive oil you will find served fresh in my house....  But then there's the supply issue.  While at first, I was happy to find QC Olive Oil at AJ's, I realized that I needed a more reliable supplier close to home, which is when I found that they have an ongoing presence at several farmers markets and I can order their products from ZonieBaskets.com.  Bingo!  I can now safely rely on QC Olive Oil as my main source of sweet rich olive-y goodness.

I'm a huge fan of Pita Jungle..... just not this location.  We went in after my son's surgery across the street not too long ago, and I was a little disappointed by the layout, chintzy/crafty bathroom and wall decor, and the surprisingly lame server we got.  Next time (hopefully there won't be one like this for me anytime soon), I'd prefer to drive a few miles to either the original location on Apache/Dorsey or to the one at Dobson/Ray if it's still there.

Meh, not so great in my opinion. I think that if it were inexpensive and I were a teenager with a huge appetite, I'd be all for Jumbo Buffet. But seriously, there's just too much going on here, and the food generally seems a little too rich for my tastes -- even the veggies, soaked in a salty, buttery sauce.  If they were to focus on one cuisine, maybe, it would be better overall, but this is entirely a plethora of well-presented yet mediocre food.  And now that I've written this, I see a picture on the profile with a hot dog and sushi that pretty much says it all.....

I've followed owner Johnny Chu through several of his Asian dining concepts, and I must say that this one is the best in its all-around atmosphere, bar setting, and tapas selection.  I still miss his influence over Fate, but Sens is sure to bring back the fun of Lucky Dragon in a more mature and sophisticated way.  This is definitely my pick for chic cocktail bar in downtown Phoenix.  Oh by the way.....  Don't try to order takeout.  They won't do it, and I respect that decision.  But I will say that Catherine was not happy that she couldn't get her soup dumplings last spring while she sat at home in the final days of pregnancy.  :-)

Our favorite neighborhood Chinese restaurant.  They really need to expand their veggie menu, although I still haven't gotten tired of the House Tofu dish.  I think we've gotten that every time we've gone to Li's Bowl, but have also tried the House Shrimp and a couple other dishes.  All in all, this is some of the better takeout in our part of town.

I have some friends coming into town for a fantasy baseball draft party.  We all hail from Tempe, so we thought we would check out this "cool" new hotel and see whether it would be a decent place to house a couple of our out of town guests..... ummm no, the rooms are a joke!  And then the rest of the scene looks like the classic button-down business hotel trying way too hard to masquerade as being all up in da club.  Overall, I'd say there's some great interior design going on here, but nothing else that I'd want from a hotel (like spacious, comfortable rooms...).  And as for trying to be trendy, I'd agree with the previous reviewer who pointed out that this freeway-meets-strip mall location doesn't seem like the place for hipness.  Maybe if it were within walking distance of restaurants/bars, but this is on the ugly end of the lake with very little going for it.  We chose to save a little cash and go with a more convenient location.  ***FYI, I probably would have given this two or three stars if not for the need to offset the apparently overzealous fans here.  But still... location, location, location.

Great happy hour deal on the wine and beer!  But I was a little concerned that the beer selection was somewhat haphazard compared to the care that the restaurant has placed elsewhere in the menu.  At Catherine's urging, I went for my first bite of Postino's signature bruschetta selection last Saturday with a couple of friends.  All I can say is that it was yummy and a huge improvement in positioning from what I recall of my last visit to their Arcadia location (a couple years ago).  I remember previously thinking that Postino was little more than an average but trendy neighborhood spot.  This time around, my only recommendation besides improving the beer menu (only one local brew!) is that they perhaps drop the price of the bruschetta by about $3-$5.  For afternoon snacks and drinks, I thought $45 for two was pushing it a little.

Back to my belief that service needs to weigh heaviest on expectations in the "service industry," I've got to share an experience at Local Breeze from a recent visit.  My friend ordered a salad without the bacon, but the kitchen apparently missed this request and made it the normal way.  Fair enough.... accidents happen. But as we then tried getting the server's attention to fix the situation, he was less than responsive. Finally, after my friend had picked around at her salad for a while and the rest of us finished our meals, the waiter insisted on bringing a new salad. My friend declined the replacement since it had already taken so long and asked, instead, that it be removed from the check. After much ado from the service staff/manager, this was the agreed upon solution.  But when the check came, there was a miscellaneous charge of $6.... That was for the portion of the salad that our friend ate. Serious!?!?!? The restaurant would not back down from this position, so they got our $6 and will not likely get another dime. Ever.  Too bad... Local Breeze otherwise seems like a nice place with decent food. If only they were better at being a restaurant, I would fully support them.

The prices were a tiny bit high for this otherwise seemingly average lunch spot, but execution and ambiance were great. All in all, I thought it was slightly better than A-OK. However, a friend has a rather hilarious story about being shooshed by the bartender who paradoxically insisted that he was not tending a "bar" as he scolded my friend's group. To experience this shooshing, I might just have to return someday and try to ruin the Parlor's beloved ambiance. Eh, maybe not, but I'm keeping this option open.

Yay for happy hour deals! After several visits to this hip little rum bar on the light rail line, I've got to say I will keep coming back for the casual and welcoming patio. The food isn't exceptional, but it is good; beer selection could be better; and there are some great rum drinks. I thought the concept was well executed overall. We could use more places like this in the area.

I really hope these guys succeed, although I was quite disappointed to find that this is not actually a farmers market at all, but in fact an individually owned grocery store with a random assortment of items.  Add to this the fact that on the day that I last visited, there was a huge national supplier truck blocking half of the parking and I had a tough time finding truly local products.  I will continue to support these guys as a more local alternative than the chain groceries in the vicinity, although I will grumble every time that my expectations are let down by the name and reputation of this store.  This is no Gentle Strength.  And by the way, I think they charged me a credit card processing fee.  Lame!

I was headed to a more familiar fish & chips place down the street for a snack, and then noticed that the police were eating lunch at Maryln's -- usually a good sign in my opinion. So I stopped in at the drive-thru where the very polite owner took my order. His son (couldn't have been much older than 12) then greeted us at the pickup window, and he too was very nice. When the owner realized that we hadn't actually offered fish, he insisted on adding a complimentary piece to our order so we could try it. I thought this would mean a small bite, but nope; it was a full fillet of tilapia. Service was all-around excellent, especially for a drive-thru experience.  I drove off happily with my clam strips, okra, and tilapia, plus chicken nuggets with fries for my son. Everything was quite tasty, including the spicy cocktail sauce, tartar sauce, and the ranch (it's the runny style that I prefer). I shall most certainly return, and next time I'm ordering fish. Oh, and I learned from a neighbor that the name is indeed a typo -- owners decided they liked it that way, so they ran with it. Ha!

Pizza Hut is absolutely to be avoided at all costs.  It is disgusting.  It makes Duner's, located in the same shopping center, seem appealing, and you can see that it too gets one star from me.  That is all.

This one rounds out my selection of pizza shops in Laveen.  They all get one star, although I think I will now go back and modify my rating of Duner's, which is the only locally owned place for za nearby, to reflect that it's at least better than Domino's, Pizza Hut, and Little Ceasar's.  The only redeeming quality about Domino's is the ease of ordering and delivery.  Thank goodness I won't have to change out of my snuggy to get pizza at home!

I generally try to avoid this location, mostly late at night.  It seems like there are always hoodlums hanging around outside, and the store itself is run down and old.  I've heard that Circle K plans to replace this building soon, which is an excellent idea.  But when the QT opens across the street, I will likely try to go there instead anyhow.  I wonder if others will do the same, and thus help speed up the decision to demolish and rebuild.

One of many great little Mexican restaurants in the area, this one definitely has the best salsa bar. This provides for amazing combinations on a variety of tacos selections. Great place to drop in for a late lunch or early dinner, when they aren't too busy.

I rarely ever eat fast food, but then sometimes get a craving and am pleased to find something a little more like real food than the typical Burger King/McDonald's variety.  Along comes Culver's, the perfect place to roll through the drive through for an instant reward to my junk food craving of the moment.  Thinking that I'd probably have to settle on a greasy burger and fries if I didn't want a bland chicken sandwich and typical fast food salad, I was pleased to find pork tenderloin sandwiches on the menu (the other white meat that you can dunk in grease and fry) along with a range of sides.  My wife grabbed a frozen custard, I got the pork tenderloin with cole slaw, and  we both went away happy with our classic fast food selections.  Don't get me wrong, this place is nothing that I'd rave endlessly about, but it does fill a huge void in its segment and I'd argue it's probably far superior to places like In N Out, with its slightly broader (yet not overwhelming) selection and what appeared from the car to be a much more thoughtful seating layout.  Not only that, but I don't think you need to believe in Jesus to order the fries here (no bible verses on the packaging).  A little religion doesn't hurt while clogging your arteries, but Culver's was homey and family style without appearing to take sides on such a big non-fast food related issue as religion.  I'm a believer.

I've gone here a few times for a brow wax and last time was talked into getting a pedicure as well. Each experience was a good one, particularly because it doesn't stink the way that most nail salons do. And it's true what they say about those chairs -- they are awesome.   Also, the staff seems friendlier and more engaging, to which my wife would also attest. She goes far more frequently than I do and uses a broader range of the spa services. from what I could tell during my last visit, she is not at all alone in being a regular here.

This cafe is 100% vegetarian, with the vegan option available on every menu item.  From past experiences with veggie restaurants in Phoenix, this kind of classification would probably make me less eager to try the place......  which is why I'm happy that the chef/owner instead chose to focus on the fact that they use fresh, local, and organic ingredients -- vegetarianism is more of an afterthought.  So we decided to try it yesterday for lunch.  To start, Pomegranate offers a wonderful selection of teas, coffees, and various juice/smoothie options.  I wanted something cool and caffeinated, so I ordered the toddy, which features my favorite local roaster's beans -- Cartel.  My wife order a peach iced tea.  Very good, but if memory serves correctly, you won't find any drink options for less than $2.00 or so.  Then onto the main course.  I ordered the veggie burger, which is made from a sprouted tofu, served on a sprouted spelt bun, and garnished with cheddar cheese (or vegan cheese if you prefer), avocado, tomato, and a little tiny dollop of miso mayonnaise.  It also comes with a catch-all selection of sides: salad, tortilla chips, fruit slices, and a pickle.  $10 or so.....  Here's my take on the burger:  The spelt bun was better than any other spelt bun/bread that I've ever had before.  This was perhaps the second most notable part of this burger.  The most notable was the patty itself, which had a nice mellow nutty flavor -- not trying too hard to be be fake beef and not overpowering in soy flavor.  It was actually one of my favorite veggie burgers ever.  But here's my beef with the preparation: too skimpy on the rich, fatty stuff.  There was a very thin slice of cheese and almost nothing of the single condiment provided, which the menu told me was a miso mayo.  Thanks to the avocado, it was still a little rich, but not the kind of juicy decadence that I've always felt characterizes a great burger.  And seriously, I would have liked to have tasted the miso mayonnaise, but instead added my salad dressing to the burger to make it less dry, and this basically obscured whatever taste the mayo may have offered.  The salad was just fine, garnished with what seemed like a raw berry dressing of some sort.  I had no idea that the white stuff in the plastic cup was also for the salad (apparently a living caesar dressing), until the meal was almost over.  I thought it was my mayonnaise for the burger.  Next time, I'll try to get it right and see how the salad tastes with both dressings.  We also tried the hummus, mainly because it's the perfect baby-appropriate snack for my son to sling all over the restaurant (the remarkably polite staff was also quite pleasant about bringing in a messy toddler, by the way, which is a plus).  The hummus was actually quite tasty, but somehow not in a "traditional" way.  It seemed a little crisper and fresher than most hummus I've had, which was a nice complement to the fresh veggies served with it.  My only additional request for the hummus is that perhaps the restaurant could throw in a few tortilla chips as well?  My wife tried the vegan BLT, made with a tempeh-based bacon.  It must have been tasty, because this is one of the first times I've missed my opportunity to try a bite of her dish.  She literally devoured it and then criticized me for nitpicking at the veggie burger's preparation.  I'm pretty sure she'd give this place a 5-star rating, and she may convince me to do the same on our return visit with the in-laws, who have been looking for a place like this.  Oh, one final note.  I spoke with the chef/owner after our meal, to offer our compliments and inquire about the cuisine and the marketplace, etc.  She mentioned something that should be readily apparent to most foodies, which is that the key to providing tasty veggie options is to go with a macrobiotic whole food focus -- this approach de-emphasizes the constraints and instead focuses on building a good meal from quality ingredients.  Well done, chef.

Since I gave Duners, across the street, a one-star review, I thought I should spread the wealth.  Maybe if I'm really jonesin' for a za I will join the line of cars picking up their $5 pies, but otherwise I avoid this place.  Perhaps I'll go check out Duners again and see whether they have been properly motivated to exceed my Little Ceasar's expectations.

Ummm, do they really charge almost $20 for full-priced admission? That seems crazy to me! We took advantage of the groupon deal and I still didn't feel like I got a great value.  This was mostly like looking at large fish tanks with average sized fish for an exceptional home aquarium (or an aquarium store, for that matter). Then there's the grand finale, which is the ocean TUNNEL!!! Oooooohhhhhh, 20 feet or so where you get to see more of the same tank that you just saw from another angle. I'm pretty sure this is the only "impressive" display they had, and even it was lacking in many ways.  For starters, the tunnel was closed off for repairs when we tried visiting Sea Life a few weeks ago, so we thankfully decided to come back another time. Then when we came back today, I found that it was still not looking like tip-top condition -- we could see the black liner through the sand, for instance, and the top of the aquarium's water level is just barely above the glass.  This place didn't even capture much of my toddler's attention. His favorite part, I think, was the McD's-type play gym at the end of the tour, and I've seen better versions of those as well.  No thank you, Sea Life. As much as I initially thought this seemed like a silly idea, I am now convinced. We'll look at the fish on our next trip to the coast and feel better about the whole experience.

For my last anniversary, I couldn't decide what to get my wife.  We had already done a ton of cool stuff and exchanged great gifts in the years before.  That's when I thought I should contact Debbie, a local artist who I trust to recommend something great from her jewelry collection.  Sure enough, she produced a great necklace/earrings set almost immediately, and Catherine (my wife) was totally impressed.  Thanks, Debbie, for your wonderful creation.  Catherine still wears the set frequently; order #2 is on the way soon.

Let me start by saying that I'm very critical of Italian restaurants.  I seriously don't even want to like them sometimes, or so it seems -- my Sicilian grandma can probably kick your favorite chef's butt when it comes to rich Southern Italian fare.  Add to this the fact that I'm still grieving the loss of my old standby, Pappa Razzini's, where I was quite practically a part of the family, but I digress.  I had been eagerly looking forward to trying La Cucina Italiana, as it just recently opened not too far from my house in Laveen -- and seriously, the 75,000 or so people located between downtown and South Mountain deserve more dining options than what we have had in the past.  Quiessence and Amano's were our two best options before this restaurant opened, and it now joins those on my list of local favorites.  Last night, my neighbor conveniently derailed what was supposed to be a guys' night out by instead turning it into a double date night.  That's cool.  Babysitter, check.  Inexpensive entrees and free BYOB wine policy, check.  Wait, what?!  Yep, we brought along a couple bottles of our own wine and paid nothing in corking fees.  Apparently, they plan to start charging as soon as the restaurant gets its liquor license in a couple weeks, but Chef Andy says he plans to keep it limited to $5.  And he has plans for an awesome rooftop cigar bar, which will have amazing views of the mountain.  I'm very much looking forward to all of this.  So here's my take on where the restaurant stands now on food, service, and ambience:  As we walked in, I definitely got a "new restaurant" vibe -- not in a bad way, mind you, but it wasn't quite chugging along yet.  I also picked up on the fact that the decor spoke to something a little nicer than the typical $10 entrees on the menu.  But I think this is perfect for the area, which can support both the higher end unique fine dining experience and a locally owned affordable kind of restaurant.  This place is like the perfect compromise.  So here we are in a new restaurant, a first visit for our entire group.  A member of the waitstaff greeted us immediately and seated us at a table for four, plopping the stack of menus in the middle of the table and walking away -- apparently a different server would be taking care of us.  Next, we were handed a tasty looking antipasto platter by a younger guy who endeavored to tell us what was on it, but we proceeded to finish all his sentences for him.  Then the server brought out our water, wine glasses, and a cork screw.  We got the wine flowing as we looked over the menu, which had a pasta selection divided by pasta types -- all were long noodles, except for the gnocchi.  When my wife asked if she could interchange sauces and pastas, the server went to the kitchen to check before coming back and saying yes.  So on to our salads and entrees.  Our table shared both the caprese salad and one like it but with gorgonzola and onions, which I thought was a great alternative to the all too common caprese.  My wife ordered gnocchi with pesto and I had the fettuccine with eggplant in a cream sauce.  Both dishes were perfectly executed, and we got to learn precisely why....  Chef Andy is definitely a first-class chef and restauranteur.  When one of the members of our party noticed a problem with her plate, he personally came out to apologize and offer to bring her a part of her entree so that she could start eating with everyone else as he fixed everything.  This was a great way to handle the problem, as it was the beginning of our friendship with Chef Andy.  He came back out to check on us after the meal, when we noticed that there were no more new arrivals coming in, so we invited Andy to join us for a drink and chat for a while.  A few things we learned:  1.  A high-butterfat cream means richer cream sauces without having to add extra butter or oil. 2.  A decent cook should be able to sauté in any pan.  Sure it's sometimes nice to have a coated non-stick pan for eggs, but everything else will do fine in almost any stainless pan. 3.  Chef Andy is something of an Italian purist.  He even plans to start his wine list with only Italian labels.  This is just fine by me, although I also urged him to try a couple of the Italian style AZ varieties.  Next time, I guess I'll just have to bring a bottle.  So why only 4 stars?  A few reasons: -Several hiccups in the service that need to be addressed, and should be easily overcome with a little extra training, experience, and confidence. -Ambience was hampered a tad by the glaring Circle K lights from next door, but this too is being addressed with some forthcoming window shades. -Pasta menu was a little confusing.  I personally don't usually care about the difference between different pasta shapes.  If the chef does care about this, then please at least tell me why.  Otherwise, I'd prefer to see the menu organized by different criteria, like sauce types.  I look forward to revisiting this restaurant soon.

This review is specifically for David Guzman, to whom I have gone many times over the years.  I guess I'm a little conflicted about reviewing him here and making it even more difficult to get an appointment, but he really does deserve the praise.  David has done several different styles for me in the past, and he always starts with a detailed consultation to ensure that we understand each other, which I think is a great way to go about business for anyone -- especially a stylist, where you will rarely find such a quality.  More than once, I recall, he even politely disagreed with my opinion of what to do when changing my haircut.  He then thoughtfully explained why his idea was better for the way my hair grows and he was right.  I appreciate this kind of feedback immensely since I trust him as the professional.  And speaking of David, I think I owe him a call..... it's been a while since I came in.

Ratings on scale of 1-5 (last visit)  Tastiness.................................................... 4 Greasiness................................................. 5 Management yelling at employees......... 5  (including Greek accent) Ambiance (aside from yelling)..................3 Price/Value....................................................3  Ok, that's the best I could do to replicate Sean's impressively objective rating system without committing all out plagiarism.  It's just that I've chosen to include slightly different criteria.  The fries are indeed cooked in grease from the heavens, and then served in a big greasy brown paper pouch.  They were so much better than most I've had, especially from such an apparent hole-in-the-wall place.  The gyro was heaping full of flavorful, salty lamb/beef (at least I assume that's the mix, even though the menu doesn't specify).  It is then drenched in a creamy tzatziki sauce and topped with onions and tomato.  In all, very good.  Another plus was the fact that the manager/owner told me he would have my meal ready in less than five minutes from when I ordered over the phone.  While I was at first a tad suspicious that quality might suffer from such hasty preparation, I decided to happily roll with the welcome comfort of an immediately sated appetite.  And sated I was..... I now feel like I'm moments away from a food coma as I digest this big gut bomb.  The only comfort I have is that I got to chuckle a little bit about the owner/manager interrogating and berating his employee (family member?) in front of me as he inquired about how I discovered his restaurant.  When I said that it was from an ex-employee having left a menu and not from his guys dropping one off, he decided that maybe he should go deliver the damn menus to area businesses himself!  I agree that this is a sensible idea -- he sounded like he needed a break from the restaurant.  Overall pretty good.  I just might be back again soon.  But I do think the prices could stand to drop a buck or so.

Met a friend for beers at 32 Shea recently and was really charmed and impressed with the place. It's clearly more of a coffee shop, but really just an all-around nice little neighborhood gathering spot. I'm sure I'll be back next time I'm in the area.

I wouldn't say it's terrible, but also not my first pick for Mexican food in the area. I've had the carnitas and carne platters in the past and thought they were fine. Tonight, however, we decided to take advantage of their Tuesday specials on burritos and tacos...  Chicken burrito -- decent marinade (although it may be a tad too spicy for some), and that's about it. They did not do a good job of trimming the fat and gristle, which I recalled of their other meats as well. I understand that fat is good for cooking, but I don't want big chunks of it in my burrito.   Beef taco -- nothing particularly wrong with it other than its total lack of flavor. They must use a low grade of beef, which is fine except that it's tough and seemingly not at all marinated. It's like the opposite of the chicken, which I don't understand. Isn't beef easier to marinate?  Rice and beans -- as others have noted, they just aren't at all exciting. What a shame, since nothing else on the menu particularly stands out.   I think I'll be avoiding Federico's in the future. There are too many other good options nearby.

BYOB. Check the website for the beer/wine policy and then come and enjoy! Love that we have this intimate jazz club in downtown Phoenix, and they're all about inviting novices along with the jazz aficionados. No pretensions here - just good music in a comfortable setting.

After hearing several rave reviews of this place, we decided to check it out on a Saturday night. It's a few miles from home and it's new, so the positive reviews made it a must.  What we hoped would be a rare family dinner out (our son was even on his best behavior) ended up turning into a takeout experience. We were too hungry to wait behind another group for one of the very few tables. No biggie -- I just wish I had been better warned that it's tough to get a table here.  Our takeout order was ready in a little over ten minutes, maybe fifteen, and the server/cashier offered us a couple of complimentary bottled waters as we waited. So we were impressed with the friendly service and good communication from the kitchen. We ordered a couple of noodle dishes, including pad thai, as well as a curry entree. All were excellent, with subtle yet flavorful sauces and veggies cooked just right. We shall return soon and try the dine-in experience, maybe on a weeknight.

My wife and I first visited Angels Trumpet in September 2015 after being told we needed to check it out by some friends from the burbs (apparently this is better than Applebee's). It was kind of "good enough" but had some decent beers to give it a notch above mediocre at first take. That said, the server couldn't tell us much about the beers..... I'm pretty sure we got the "light beer" vs "dark beer" comment, or something of the sort - very disappointing for a server at an ale house (she later admitted, "I'm not really a beer drinker"). Overall a kind of "meh" experience.  About a month later, a client recommended meeting here and I thought it was worth giving it a second try. This was a better experience than the previous one, but still just not hitting it on the head for me. This place is seriously missing something in the way of ambiance or otherwise. It feels so bland and mediocre, and yet I feel it has so much potential.   I've been back a few times since last fall, reluctantly - to meet up with friends/colleagues - each time getting yet another "Well, it's not Applebee's, I guess" kind of experience. As of March, I've decided to put an end to the repeated disappointment. I made my last visit there just before learning that the owner sabotaged an effort to build up the area's appeal to residents like me, which was supported by an awesome group of nearby bars/restaurants and others. Wow, seriously?! Way to ensure that your ambiance never improves! Angel's Trumpet: not Applebee's and not feeling good in the neighborhood. Go somewhere else if you want quality, service, and genuineness from a pub.

Barrel-aged manhattans is all I can say. I tried the white and the red -- liked the white far more, which is interesting given that I've never tried making one at home. Maybe it was the subtle surprise, or maybe they just have an awesome recipe. The flavors melded together beautifully in each version, and I look forward to trying the red manhattan again in a few more weeks. This is the first time I've been excited about a beverage at a bar in quite a while. Looked like they had a great beer selection too -- maybe next time.

Not only is this soap produced locally and ethically, it's quite wonderful. From the cool variety of thoughtful colors to the carefully selected scent combinations, I've almost never been disappointed. Bamboo Detox and Orange Vanilla are a couple of my favorite scents, but there are plenty more from which to choose. My wife is a subscriber of the "soap of the month" club, so we've tried a variety and are always excited to see what's next to try. Highly recommended.

Farmed salmon dish posing as real wild caught salmon (look it up); server didn't know any better so she lied in saying that it was indeed wild. That about sums it up for me. Otherwise uninspired menu that is overall decent enough but not spectacular. Same goes for the ambiance and decor. It looks like they tried to do something interesting here, hired skilled designers and mostly pulled it off, but it still kind of falls flat. Very typical Fox concept. I'd come back if they priced it as what it is, but this is definitely a lame corporate concept struggling to pose as something that it never can be.

I like this place, I really do - and I love that it is located in downtown Phoenix. Even more to its credit, B&T is located in the beautifully renovated old Luhrs building, and the ambiance is awesome.  Having been a few times before, I recently read an unflattering review of B&T's reservation policy. I mentioned this to a friend, a fellow classic cocktail enthusiast, and he said, "Let's check it out this week!" And it was on. I called in advance and thoroughly grilled the polite guy who answered my call, but all I could gather was that reservations probably weren't needed and they'd be happy to see us in about an hour (this was a Thursday evening). This was reliable information - we were promptly seated in a booth when we arrived.  So, how about the drinks/food (listed by order of priority in my mind)? The lengthy drink menu "book" is a little bit much for me, but the owner, Ross, explained it when he came out to our table to check on us last night. True to his explanation, that menu style has pushed me to try several drink recipes that are outside my normal comfort zone (on multiple visits), and I'm glad I did.  Also unexpectedly at our table last night was the head chef from the kitchen (don't forget that this place is more than just cocktails). My wife asked the waitress about noodle dishes (not on the menu), so the chef came out to discuss what he could make from scratch to satisfy her request. We ended up sharing a delicious Thai-style curry dish as a result.  And lastly, this review would be incomplete without a mention of the other off-menu sampling we did last night. Ross, while geeking out over mixology experiences with my friend Keith, decided to let us sample a Czech herbed liquor called becherovka. It was pleasant. Also pleasant was the "secret menu" (for cocktail geeks only) that we received and from which we ordered. This is the menu I will try on my next visit.
