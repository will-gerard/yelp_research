The best alterations location I've found in the Phoenix metro area, and trust me I've tried a few.  I took some men's dress shirts here about two years ago to have them altered, and they turned out perfect.  After I moved I took any new shirts I got to different tailors closer to my house, but never got quite the same level of results; now I'm back to taking everything to this place, even though it takes a while to drive across town to get here.

I find there are very few establishments that do what I would really call 'good business' still left in the world.  I'm sure there are plenty I just run in to them every once in a rare while.  The Keg is one of them.  Two stories:  The first time I went here my friend and I just wanted a good steak so we searched out yelp and found The Keg was close.  Right off the bat I noticed the atmosphere was pretty nice, nothing over the top, but enjoyable.  I also noticed that the wait staff knew their shit.  Our waitress explained all the specials and recommended her favorites without hesitation.  The real highlight was before our food came when the manager came over and asked us if it was our first time.  He then brought us a shrimp cocktail on the house to kick off our meal.    The second visit was for a friend's birthday.  We ordered a round of chocolate cake shots and the manager showed up to mix them himself and bought us our first round.  He also gave us each recipes to take home with us.   The food on both occasions was great, I haven't had a good cut of meat like it since I left the midwest.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive, and I will definitely be going back.

Just paid the installer for my broken window and came inside.  I had someone break into my car last night to steal my stereo and so of course I needed a new driver's side window and on top of it I had a meeting at work.    I gave these guys a call at 2pm on a Friday and they got a guy out here by 5:30 to install my window, so I got to drive home with A/C that actually accomplishes something.  The installer was prompt and friendly, and he went above and beyond vacuuming out my car of any little shards of broken glass, not just the area he needed to work in.    When you've had a shitty day because someone broke into your car, it's really nice to have some competent people do an outstanding job.  Thanks again to Mike (the installer) and everyone at Scottsdale Auto Glass.

I lived off Salazar Bros my first year of college because I lived right near it.  Must have eaten there twice a week minimum.  I was heartbroken when it turned into Armando Bros because as much as people told me they just changed their name, they didn't.  It was a different restaurant.    I had written it off as another great place gone to the pages of history until I moved near 48th and Baseline, and 'lo and behold there was Salazar's, tucked away in the Fry's parking lot next to a Little Caesars and a clothing outlet that appears to have escaped from the mall.    The interior itself is cheaply thrown together and completely forgettable.  The only thing the employees seem to care about is making food.  And none of this bothers me because they make some damn amazing food for cheap prices.  I recommend the adobada burrito with extra sour cream and 2 things of red sauce.  It's pork brushed with a delicious sauce of some sort.  Comes with pico and guacamole.  I sometimes have to convince myself to try something new off the menu.  Brownie points for carrying Pepsi products as well, I take Mountain Dew with my burritos.

Exactly what I've been looking for in a car wash.    Having recently moved out of Tempe, I was looking for a new car wash to go on a weekly basis.  And after a few bad experiences elsewhere, this will be my new car wash of choice.    - Extremely cheap (especially given the area) - Plenty of different car wash levels - Very quick - Don't look down their noses at you if you get their cheapest wash (sometimes I hate Scottsdale)   I need to remember to look into their passes the next time I go in.  I would definitely get enough use out of them.

Just finished a year lease here.  I know it's really popular to bag on every apartment complex on Yelp, but this place is solid.  Pros:  The office staff is excellent, which I can very rarely say - Dan and Robin do an awesome job, have maintenance out immediately after you request it, and will help out it dire circumstances.   I once gave a friend coming into town the wrong key when he dropped by my job across town to pick it up, I called the office and asked them to let them in and they walked down and opened my apartment for my friends (after verifying my identity via email).  The community is quiet.  Prices are very reasonable.   The cons:  The apartments were built in the 80's, and look like they were built in the 80's, but have been maintained well.  You get what you pay for, neither super cheap nor luxury.

I don't know about all the New York vs Boston pizza that I see written here.  But I do know that Slices has great pizza (definitely the best in the Mill District) at extremely cheap prices.

Pretty average establishment and one of the few places undeserving of its 4/5 Yelp rating in my opinion.  The place is average in terms of size and accomodations.  It has a frustratingly small parking lot.  The service is slow and the staff is generally pretty obnoxious.  The food ranges from typical bar fare to a  couple upscale dishes.  The deal breaker here is the atmosphere.  I see reviews stating that it's a "great laid-back place to go hang out".  I'm not sure what bar they were talking about, but it isn't Casey Moore's.  This is the type of place people go to be seen.  Most of the patrons on the weekends look like they fell out of an Urban Outfitters ad.  These are the type of people that spend three hours in front of the mirror perfecting their "just threw this outfit on" look.  Yes indie kids, I'm talking to you: Don't worry, they serve PBR here.  I know you'll lose your superhero powers of "listening to music no one's ever heard of" if you don't consume at least one Pabst a day.   If you're determined to go, go on a weekday and avoid the hipsters.   People send friends ahead to camp out tables for entire weekend evenings, so good luck finding a place to sit.  Otherwise, just head a few blocks away to Four Peaks.

I ended up going here today because Spinato's is closed on Sundays & Mondays (god damn you Spinato's, why are you so tasty).  Overall I was impressed with the place.    The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and cozy, with a very large, wood-burning brick pizza oven viewable from most of the tables.  We walked in right as they were opening so the oven was still firing up, but it was entertaining to watch.  The menu is fairly eclectic, a selection of appetizers, salads and pasta dishes compliment the array of pizzas available.  The pizza selection ranges from your typical pepperoni to mozzarella, basil, and cherry tomatoes, with others containing very traditional Italian toppings.  They also seemed to have a pretty decent wine selection, even though that really isn't my cup of tea.    The pizzas are thin crust and don't utilize any tomato sauce (at least none that I saw), but were very good even though I'm not a big fan of thin-crust pizzas.  Everything tasted very fresh, which is nice when you're burnt out on Papa Johns.  My only complaint were that the pizzas are a little small (12'' and they only come in one size).  For $17 I was hoping to get a little more for my money, but it wouldn't stop me from coming back.    Definitely more 'date night' than family-dining.  I didn't see any tables for more than four people and there isn't a lot of room to push tables together.  All in all worth checking out, but I still think I'll head to Spinato's when I want a regular pizza.  One thing to watch out for:  The place is small and tucked into the corner of the strip mall.  So much so that the parking-lot-visible sign is located over an establishment that is now closed.  At first I thought the restaurant had gone out of business, but further investigation proved it was simply hidden.

Tott's is great pan-Asian food for a very reasonable price.    One day at work one of my co-workers asked if I wanted to go out to lunch.  I agreed and we set out.  We each got 1 veto.  Hers was Panda Express, mine was Kyoto Bowl.  We kept driving and she remembered Tott's, and I've never bothered going to Panda again.  Great food and great service.  The owner is a small Asian man who smiles a lot and always wants to know if he can get us anything else.  I see him every time I go.  Everyone I go with loves their orange chicken.  It is very tasty, but a little on the sweet side for me.  I like a spicy dish, so I go with the Malaysian Curry.  Chicken, red curry, fresh veggies, fried rice.  Amazing.

Two words:  Painfully Mediocre  Imagine your favorite and/or average Chinese food delivery place.  Now divide the flavor in half.  Now multiply the price by 3.  Perfect, now find a place that isn't PF Chang's to eat tonight.  Seriously though, you are paying for mediocre food in a "trendy" environment.  Trendy is another way of saying "long wait" and "stupid employees".  The Olive Garden : Italian food :: PF Chang's : Chinese food analogy doesn't even work here.  And I make fun of Olive Garden ALL the time.  If you are really determined to get mediocre Chinese food, find a Pei Wei.  It's owned by the same family and is the same food but for less.  And if you're looking for a Pei Wei in Tempe, AZ, just go to Tott's Asian Diner.  It's in the same strip mall and it's way way better.

Ate here once a week for almost a year.  Until I got food poisoning =(  I suppose it's the risk you take eating fast food, but I still won't be back.  2 stars because as much as I eat there it was bound to happen eventually.

I'll have to go with Mr. K on this one, a definite pass.  There are three other hookah lounges all within a half mile of Oasis and they are all worlds better than this one.  Go to Urban Cafe or even King Tuts, just anywhere but here.   The food is mediocre, nothing stood out one way or the other.  The music was a little annoying, but I'm not really into pop music or hip-hop, but I suppose people who are would enjoy it.  However, the service is absolutely terrible.  I've been there twice and on both occasions the (extremely late) delivery of food saved me from walking out the door.  Their hookahs are not good, and you practically have to tackle an employee if you want more coals.  Save yourself the frustration and go to Urban Cafe or King Tuts.  Urban is a bit more for the mediterranean loving, less-frills crowd.  Tuts if you still like your hip-hop and being surrounded by ASU students.

I've eaten at plenty of Fili B's, but this one takes the cake.  As a general rule, Filiberto's makes delicious food in heaping portions for relatively no money.  I'm sure there's millions of calories in it, I don't care.  I recommend the Carne Asada Steak Fries.  What set's this one apart from the rest is their service.  A good friend of mine owns a private bar a three minute walk from this Filibertos, and we generally stumble through their drive-through on foot between the hours of 3 and 5 in the morning on our designated drinking day.  The first time we did this I was 100% positive that we were going to get shut down, but the owner of the bar said he does it all the time and they don't mind.  We tried to get the car sensor at the menu to work but we couldn't get it to register us, so we went up and knocked on the window.  I, even in my inebriated state was mortified at the notion that we were about to get told off by a Filiberto's drive-through worker, however, the lady running it just smiled at us and asked what she could get for us.  Awesome.  I go here just about every week on foot and they always serve me with a smile.  A smile that I don't get when I go through in my car, come to think of it.

Great place!  I would have never even noticed it tucked in the corner of the Chiba Hut lot if someone hadn't pointed it out to me.  This is one of the more interesting 'homesy' places in Phoenix that I enjoy going to and taking out of town visitors to.    The restaurant itself is very simple, it is very narrow and rectangular.  Most of the seating is at the bar/counter, which is right on the other side of the food preparation area.  There are about six or seven tables in the place, and they are all pushed up to the one wall that isn't the kitchen.    I have only good things to say about the food.  I watched mine be prepared from scratch as well as many other dishes and their ingredients are extremely fresh.  If you're crass like myself you could boil everything down to gourmet hot pockets.  The crust is flaky and just hard enough to keep it's shape, and there is almost no end to the ingredients you can order inside, from the traditional to the exotic.    I also noticed they had some great beers in stock.  I've never walked in to a Phoenix restaurant (excluding those attached to breweries) and seen Chimay on the menu.    All-in-all a great place to eat, I've been back a few times since my first visit and been pleased every time.

Stopped here last night because I was in the area with some friends and didn't want to head down to 4-Peaks.    Food and drinks were pretty standard but the establishment itself is extremely nice.  Plenty of TVs for sports fans and ample, well-laid out seating.  The place was not crowded at 10pm on a Friday night, which is exactly what I was looking for.  Just a place where my friends and I could walk in, grab a chair and have a few drinks.  That isn't to say there weren't people there, there was just few enough to make it seem populated but not crowded.  I'll be coming back next time I want a drink without any of the hassles that the Mill area presents.

I've had pretty good luck trying places with few reviews but high ratings, and Nunthaporn's is no exception.  We went at around dinner time on a weekday and found plenty of street parking right in front of the restaurant.   The inside is Thai reminiscent without being over-the-top or wannbe-trendy.  Plenty of seating and I didn't see any 2-top tables, which I like because I generally eat with a friend of mine and between the amount of food we order and how tall we are 2-tops generally make me claustrophobic.  The service here was great, prompt seating and order.  The menu is as expected for a Thai restaurant with about 60 dishes in all in various categories.  I had the red curry and my friend had the yellow.  We also had an order of 'Thai toast' which was a lightly fried pastry with chicken inside and covered in a sweet & sour sauce.    The curry was delicious, though the menu lead me to believe it was going to be a little more spicy.  I have fond memories of eating in small restaurants in southern Thailand and having my tongue chemically removed by spicy seafood dishes.  Next time I will try the only item (that I saw) on the menu with a four star spicy rating.  On the way out I saw two separate large parties dining and they had ordered some dishes family-style, which came in large two-tier serving bowl/platters and looked extremely tasty, so I would definitely recommend bringing larger groups here.  The prices were very reasonable and I was really happy with the quality of the food.  I will definitely be coming back often, especially since Char's on Rural / University is gone.  Overall this restaurant is probably more of a 4.5 star, but I will round up this time to keep the rating :)

I've been here 6 times now and tried their most expensive wash, their cheapest wash, and most of the in-betweens.  First off I think the place is extremely overpriced - they definitely seem to want to turn away the "under $25 car wash" customers.  The first two times I went the washes took 70 minutes to complete.  It was a busy Saturday afternoon, but an hour and ten minutes seems a bit excessive to me.  If I wanted to spend that kind of time getting my car washed I would have done it myself.  One of the last times I went I was preparing for a trip to Vegas where I knew I was going to be the only driver shuttling 15 people from the airport and back, so I put my industrial-strength rubber mats (for camping) in the car.  I paid a few bucks extra to have them cleaned so I could at least enjoy a clean car on the way up, but about half way to Vegas I realized they never put the mats back in my car.  Yes, I probably should have checked for the mats, but it didn't occur to me that they would take them out, wash them right next to the car, and then somehow neglect to put them back in.  When I got back from my trip I went back in to retrieve my mats and the guy tried to sell me an interior cleaning because my floors were wrecked from shuttling that many people around.  Fuck you, buddy.  To give you an idea - I live in the apartments right behind this place and choose to drive a few miles away to get my car washed rather than patronize this business.

I really hope this place stays open.  It never seems very busy, but I like it quite a bit.  The atmosphere is a good mix of classy vs casual.  It's definitely a cut above a sports bar or pub, but I would also not hesitate to walk in wearing jeans or shorts.  Everything is very open, and they have a nice patio that you can take your drinks out on.  The bartender was great, made conversation when he was in front of us making our drinks, but left us alone when we were obviously into our conversation.  He was mentioning to some other customers that he makes a good Bloody Mary, so I took him up on it because I really enjoy the drink, but can rarely find a decent one.  He asked how I liked them and made it to order, and I was impressed.  We ordered two of their pizzas and I was pleasantly surprised.  Mine was a mexican-style pizza with spicy ground pork, cheese, and chilis.  The girlfriend got the Neopolitan, which was also quite tasty.  I will definitely return to Detours, I just hope it's still around.  The place had a decent number of people in it when I visited on a Wednesday night, but I know restaurants are iffy in that 1-6 month period, and I know Detours has only been around for about three months.
