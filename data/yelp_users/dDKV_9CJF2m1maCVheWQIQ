The food here was very standard, nothing special or notable on the menu. Servings are large for the price but it takes horrendously long for anything to come out. We had the pork lo mein and found it hearty but bland. Friends have said the same of other options.   TL; DR - mediocre food for super low price after a long wait.

This bar is as country as Taylor Swift and the drinks are just as hard as T-Swift's rock and roll.   Took about ten minutes before a legitimate country artist was played on a Saturday night. Drinks are pricey and good whiskey is (smaybe not surprisingly) completely absent from the liquor menu. New mMs for the bar may be "Bad 80's Hits brings you Cheap Beer".   Sorry Dierks, your bar gets two stars.   Plus side: anyone looking for a non-country bar with humans drinking alcohol can find that here on the weekends.

What a magnificent establishment! After the demise of Old Town Whiskey at the hands of the Saguaro management, SSLB head alchemist John Christie has helped establish one of Scottsdale's most unique and engaging drink and food experiences. Based around a spectacular assortment of liquors (try all the bourbon, I have) the Second Story truly crafts a one of a kind experience with personal touch that is so infrequently found in Old Town. The food is an exciting treat and developing well as the chef gwts better and better! Come here and enjoy everything!
