I have been going to Carsten Institute for many years and I have always been happy. It takes a little longer for a color, but it's worth it. With my long hair I could pay $100-$150 for a cut and color, which costs about $50 at Carsten. The front desk, students and teachers are all great and work together to ensure you have a great experience. I highly recommend Carsten. Also, the spa services are wonderful!

My mother made an appointment for my daughter, myself and I for mani/pedis, and I heard her make the call. When we got there we learned that they only booked my daughter and I for manis. There was no apology and when my mother spoke to the lead lady there she turned her back to her, didn't respond and blamed my mother. Then they started taking the new appointments as they arrived, letting me sit there to wait. Then they told me that there was an employee coming in at 11 but she was just running late. When she finally arrived at 11:40 she was holding a tray of Starbucks and handed out drink orders, so obviously they knew she would be more than a little late and they didn't care enough to ask her to skip the Starbucks side trip. Plus the manicure I received was sub par. This is a busy shop. Maybe they feel like they can get away with that because they have a captive customer base. I'll never go there again.

I called Andrew Z.'s to ask a few questions and Scott, the owner's son, was very helpful and informative. I described what we were shopping for and Scott found an engagement ring that was in our budget and had everything on our wish list. Scott sat down and spent a good amount of time helping us select the right ring and educating us about some important things we didn't know about diamonds. It's a true family operation with Mr. and Mrs. Z. both working along with their son. They have a great reputation, and when you interact with them it is obvious why - they are very honest and genuine. They also have a wide selection of Alex and Annie bracelets which I intend to go back for. On that note, they seem to have a wide selection of Jewlery and watches in a wide range of prices. We shopped around and I can assure you their prices are competitive. I highly recommend Andrew Z's for all your Jewlery needs.

We go every Friday. This crew is awesome - always friendly and fun. And the coffee is to die for.
