Delicious! This is my FAVORITE spot in the valley... Not really a sushi eater, but their Las Vegas Roll is off the charts! Some other favorites include the Moto Chicken Salad, the Asian Nachos, the Yakisoba and the Quesadilla! Would eat here everyday if I could!  PS - Try their iced green tea! So good!

So happy to finally check out the Clarendon's restaurant re-vamp. The Huevos Rancheros were delicious. Definitely order a beverage that includes their fresh-squeezed OJ! Jake was a rockstar!!! Will most certainly be back!

Decided to give Ocotillo another try, and although the ambiance and overall decor concept is undoubtedly hip; the service and food were equally as lackluster as our first experience.  We had a 15-person reservation for a friend's birthday at 830pm. It took 20+ minutes for a server to take our initial drink order, and the service was consistently as bad throughout our entire meal.  The food is OK. The Roasted Cauliflower had to be sent back to the kitchen when it arrived to the table cold. However, once it was above room temperature, the flavors tasted delicious. Also ordered the Crispy Falafel Burger - good!  Make sure you have at least 3 choices for wine because they're likely to be out of a couple of them.  Would love to see this place get better!
