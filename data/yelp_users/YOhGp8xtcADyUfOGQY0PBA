I have been coming here for years and I have NEVER had anything but great experiences. Doctor Y is awesome and really makes each visit personal and walks me thru all the changes for improvement he has helped with my eyes. Ana is a wonderful optician and is patient and honest! She knows how to make my insurance work best for my needs. I would be a fool to go anywhere else!

Pure incompetence! How do you allow your hospital ER to be open for business when no one is properly trained and individuals can't do their job? And as for nurse Carrie who worked tonight, if you don't like your job please go somewhere that doesn't require to care about people. And doctors please don't send people home with pain killer prescriptions when you can't figure out what's wrong with them.   I would rate a zero but that's not an option

Overpriced for the work they do. I asked that they make sure the car is vacuumed and interior cleaned out well since I had a spill. When I asked for a towel I got  blank look. And why pay for car freshener if they don't put it in. At least my tires shined as promised
