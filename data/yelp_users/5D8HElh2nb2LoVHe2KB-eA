I hate this place... and they only reason I go there at all is because I work in the same shopping center.  The owner is so rude and it seems like everything is a hassle for her...  I have been going in there for over a year, but after today... im done.

Found this review in my drafts... It's been about 3 years since I went there.. Who knows if it's eve still open...was gonna delete but after reading it I remembered how mad I was and decided to post!  Worst customer service ever!  Called in to go order 30 minutes before got here to pick up and waited for 45 minutes for my order... Guy at counter either hates his job or just doesnt care about anything... People in and out never once did any staff  say hi or how can I help you and everyone had to wait at the counter for him to return because he was never standing there... Never to return...

Worst experience ever. Ordered a sourdough bacon RANCH no mayo.  Menu Says "sourdough. Bacon, ranch, mayo, onion, pickles, lettuce".  When burger came there was no ranch so I asked for a side of ranch.  Was told it would be .33 told him I ordered a RANCH sand which and he said yes but you ordered it with no mayo so would be .33 I said fine can I just have whatever comes on the sandwich? and after a 3 minute argument in front of 20 customers he gave me my ranch MAYO and said next time there will be a charge.  Should of went to smash burger.

Heard about it from a stranger... Stopped in with the fam... So glad we did!  Got to make MY pizza and the husband and kids could get whatever they wanted since they would rather die than eat feta and spinach!  Good music... Friendly staff... And manager very attentive... Oh and your pizza is done in 2 minutes... ;) This will be a regular stop.

Went to get our free Veterans Day lunch that was advertised, and this location does not support our Veterans.  I will remember that from now on. EXTREMELY rude Girl at the counter said I can give you a crazy bread but I need to see ID.  Well, Vets don't have ID's.. we are no longer in the military.  We did however bring our DD214 to show we were in the military and that was not good enough for her.  But since they aren't participating in the Free Lunch for Veterans, I am concluding that they don't support Vets.  Union Hills location participated with a smile so I guess I will go to that location from now on.

Saw a vehicle online... Called and made an appt and when I got there they were nice... But then they kept showing me all these cars when I came to look at an suv... They literally MADE me test drive a car I had zero interest in.  They had a funny atmosphere and friendly staff and were joking on the PA system, things like "don't run so fast you'll trip!" When the sales rep I was working with went running to get keys.  However, They never even showed me the suv I came to look at.   And when I wouldnt buy one of the vehicles they were forcing on me their whole attitude changed.  When I was leaving I was putting another address in my GPS I could hear them on the PA  (they didn't think I could hear with the windows up) "just leave" "get out b!" Seriously? Very professional guys.  Good job.  All in all I ended up spending more than that crappy used suv on a 2015 elsewhere where I was appreciated as a customer and gladly spent my money for something brand new.  It's too bad too because I always had my chevy serviced at the midway service center and by name alone I will not go there anymore either. Don't waste your time here.

my regular lunch stop.  Build your own Humus bowl...  i recommend the Siracha humus... chopped Mediterranean, load it with everything and their chicken is delicious.  Only think I don't like, if you choose chips they put it in the bowl... if you want them on the side instead, you have to buy a side hummus for $1.99.  i just want a few chips like you would put in the bowl for free... just don't want them to get soggy and put on the side.. but they wont do that.
