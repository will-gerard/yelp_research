Love it!!!!! I have had pizzas that were great!! The green chile burger is to die for....and oh-so-yummy sangria.  Love their cute little market too.  Con:parking can be pretty crappy and it gets really busy during peak times....expect to wait......  Oh....and do yourself a favor!!! Get a bag of their hand-made english muffins...wow!

Love this place!!!   It is so small and dark and quaint!!!  Huge wine selection...and that bruschetta ......Yum!  I didn't really need to add my review because there are so many and most agree that is place is great.  My favorite thing about Postino is on Mon and Tue nights .....you can buy a bottle of wine and a board of bruschetta for $20 ..plenty for two!  Parking can be hard around here...but they offer valet for $3..

I have been here three times and all three have been great experiences!!  I have always ordered the the mini Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry ..because after trying it the first time I was there..I just can't get enough!  Soooo yummy!  Very nice ambiance....great service...and probably the largest wine selection I have ever seen!  Love this place!

I just love the Roaring Fork!!!  I have been here countless times and every time has been a wonderful experience!!!  They have a nice big restaurant with two large patios. Warm ambiance. The food is spectacular...I loved the fish tacos..oh and that mac and cheese with the green chilies..MMMMM!!!  Great drinks and great service too!!

I have been going to Ra for years and lately I have not been a fan....I'm not sure if the restaurant is getting worse or that my taste in sushi has improved since my college days....but either way it is not good.   It is always too loud in there to where you can barely have a conversation at your table...and their food is sub-par.  If you want great sushi...I suggest going else-where....  Not to mention....I got food poisoning there in June of 09 that required a trip to the ER.  When I later called the manager to notify them of the situation....he seemed pretty unconcerned.  He didn't offer me anything...not even to pay for my dinner that later landed me a $200 ER bill!!!

I love, love, love Trader Joe's...great quality food at great prices!!!  It is my fav place to get groceries......  My only issue with this location is that it is pretty small and cramped....They are trying to fix this problem by expanding...sooo, until then you have to deal with construction, a lot of people in a small space, and lack of parking......  Looking forward to this project being complete and this location becoming bigger and better!!  oh..their mango ice cream bars are gooood...and only 60 calories!  The staff has always seemed to be friendly....   One thing I don't like is that a lot of their produce is packaged.....   I can't just buy one or two plumbs....I have to buy four.....

My room mate and I go in frequently to grab coffee and a bite.  They have some great flavored coffees at their coffee bar....(my roomie even thinks they're better than Starbucks!)...and cheaper!  The food is pretty good too...not the best..but pretty good.  They have tables outside that make for good places to sit and read when it is nice out.....

Eh... I have been dragged here multiple times...and I never want to go back again.  To be a little  fair to Hometown..eating as much low-quality food at the cheapest price you can get it ..is not not my idea of a good time.  That being said their food is just icky...and the crowds here are usually iffy too.  You will be surrounded by people that brought all 7 of their kids there for dinner..and those kids will be running all over this place screaming....And the food looks like it has been sitting around forever ...bland and tasteless... Ick....the whole thing just equals a poor dining experience!!

YUMMY!!!  I have only had delicious and fresh food from DeFalco's....and I have been a customer for the last 5 years!!  Great food, friendly staff.  Just a heads up...because the food is so good...they can tend to have a long line and you may wait for your food for a while.  They even have a sign up that states if you have don't have 15 mins to spare to wait for your food...you may not to make other lunch arrangements.....and it is true. My advice..... If you're in a rush, call in, they will take phone orders.

It there anything bad you can say about Oregano's????  I have been enjoying their food since 2001...and I have never eaten anything there that I have not loved.  All of their pizzas, salads, pastas are delicious!!!!  Their bellini is yummy!  And of course, you can't leave without ordering a pazookie!!!!! MMMMM...it's like heaven in your mouth!!!!  Expect to wait and have difficulty finding pakkring at this location...especially during peak  hours......it is still well worth it!!!

I went to Los Sombreros last night and was pretty excited to check it out since I live close and have heard great things about it.  OK...so we get there and there is no where to park..there is a lot behind the restaurant that I believe belongs to Pep Boys and has signs up saying you'll be towed if not a pep boys customer.....ugh...we took our chances since there was no where else to parking (we were thankfully not towed).  It was pretty crowded..but I was ok with that...especially since it was a Friday night. ...and then I got to meet the hostess.   Got up to her podium she looks straight at us and without saying anything like "excuse me for a minute" she turns her back to us and has a 5 minute conversation with a someone working there (which I would have been understanding about had she acknowledged I was standing there at least.  When her conversation is done  she asks how many, we say 4 (2 friends were meeting us and were seconds away).  When we ask about an estimate in time for the wait she says she won't "worry about that" until all of our party was here...I explained they were in the parking  lot..blah, blah....Her attitude was nasty and  giving me a poor first impression.  Red Sangria was Mmmmm, Queso fundido with chorizo was WOW, sea food tacos were just ok, chips and salsa were just ok....and all of it was a little over-priced!  My fav thing about this place was the ambiance...big patio outside with some fire pits going...a man playing mexican tunes on a guitar...and warm colors throughout.....Still I really don't think I will be returning..

Been here twice ...and both times were worth the wait.  It is a tiny little place with nice, genuine staffers.  Both times I ordered their specials of the day...and both times...YUM!! One was a scramble with Anaheim chilies in it....delish!  The potatoes were scrumptious too!!  Do yourself a favor and check it out...if you can...go during the week...weekend waits can be pretty long!

I went here after seeing this restaurant featured on Dinners, Drive-Ins, and Drives.  I wasn't quite sure about the mixture of Mexican and Chinese food...but I was pleasantly surprised!  The menu is a little confusing, but the girl at the counter was helpful in explaining it.  There was plenty of food and it was tasty!.....One of my creations was the carnitas in a quesadilla.......Mmmmmmm.....try it out!!!!!

I have been here quite a few times and I love it!!!  I love the cool decor and the little market.  I like the patio area..but mostly I love their red sangria..mmm...you can buy it by the pitcher!!  I have always found everyone working there to treat us with great service...It is a favorite lunch spot of mine!

Tried this place out after reading reviews here on yelp....and the people are correct.!....Jill is so sweet and made me feel at ease.  The procedure was quick and pretty painless.  Her prices are very reasonable....I wanna laser my whole body! haha

Eh...I have been here a lot of times over the last couple years and I don't so much care for it....The crowd here is usually  "iffy" and the food is...your basic type of bar food.....the place gets even worse after the sun goes down....  The only time I come here is other people are meeting here...I never suggest it...so many other places that are much better!

I can't believe people are comparing Jersey Mike's to Subway!!!!!!  No way...They slice the meat and cheese right in front of you....it is not all-processed and been sitting in a tub all day like the competitor's.  The produce is always so fresh..and on top of it....everyone is super friendly in there...  Subway does not even come close to comparing!  Sure it is a little pricier ...but I am more than willing to pay more for better tasting, fresher food...

I am so excited that I have discovered the SkySong Farmer's Market!  I live very close to this location and I am sad that I just now found out about it (I think it has been running since October 09).  It runs every Thursday from 3pm-7pm.  Today I found an array of things...some fresh produce, herbs, cheese, fresh baked breads, body salts, tea, seafood, beef, home made pastas, salsas, jellies, flowers, dog treats, fudge and cupcakes!!!  There were a ton of samples...which I loved...and everyone was so nice!! And I was excited to learn that all of the venders accept credit/debit cards.  I ended up leaving with a bunch of Italian food and fresh brerads made by Raimondo....Yum!!..I made the pesto lasagna and garlic bread tonight..mmm. Some hand-made salsa, pecan-cinnamon brittle, gerber daisies, salmon, and fresh hummus!!!!  They even had a lady singing live music while you shop!!

This place is pretty cool!!!  They offer a great variety of fun/sexy dance classes for all women and all levels!!!  I have done drop-in classes a few times and each time, all the staff in there has been awesome.  They even have a little boutique!!!  Fun, fun, fun way to get exercise!!  FYI...they can be a little hard to find.....their building is located behind the strip mall.....you have to drive behind all of the buildings (wildflower bead co, steinmart..ect)  to get to it!

Every time I come to this walmart...I have to re-remind myself that I  really don't like this place.  Ugh.....even pulling into the parking lot, I should know better.  They NEVER have enough staff there.....you have to wait in line forever to check out....and this has been the senario every time I have gone!  Not to mention, the cashiers  seem to usually have an attitude too.......... Trust me, just go to Target at the Tempe Marketplace.....

Love it!!!! Sooooo yummy and so much selection.  They will give you little sample cups so you can try out the different flavors.  And....tons of toppings!!  The place has always been nice and clean every time I have been there and the staff is nice and helpful!  I'll keep coming back to satisfy my yogurt sweet tooth!!

I was really excited to try out Lo-lo's because I had heard a lot of good things about it...but I was not very impressed.   We went on a Sunday afternoon and it was very crowded..which I normally don't mind if the food/service is amazing. Had to wait 45 min to be seated.   I ordered the Lil C (two drumsticks with a side of mac and cheese) and a side of string beans and potatoes.  The food was not what I would call very good...chicken was pretty dry and very salty.  My string beans were never brought out and I had to ask for them twice.  the service was pretty poor.....I won't be returning......

Love this place!!!  I have paid a lot more for massages that were not nearly as good!! My girl, Lala gives and amazing massage..especially if you like deep tissue..they are truly heavenly.    I come into this location monthly and my only con is the front girls ALWAYS trying to pressure me into buying a membership.  I'm here every month..if I want one, I know how to get it...Until then, my answer has always been and will probably always be, NO.....  Besides that...I love it here!
