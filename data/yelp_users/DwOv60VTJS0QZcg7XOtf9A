DO NOT GO HERE!          I rate them with one star only because you can not select negative or zero stars.  I was referred here from discount tire for an alignment. I arrived at 10am on a Tuesday morning. After numerous attempts to up sale me for brakes, rotors, and a diagnostic check. I was finally back on the road with a tire balance and rotation at 1pm. That's right NO ALIGNMENT and a three hour tire balance and rotation job. The alignment did not get done as I was told at the end while I was paying because "one of my heads are bent on my machine" I received no other explanation or even a mention of another location that could complete what I went there to have done.   To add salt to the wound I leave the location and realize that I left my prescription Oakley sunglasses in the lobby of the store. I return to the store 10-15 minutes later and ask if I left my sunglasses there. At this time a man comes out from the back with my glasses and jokingly says "I was going to sell them"  to which I replied "It appears so since no one came out to tell me I left them or called me to let me know." This just solidified my experience and showed what kind of morals and ethics  the employees really have.   DO NOT GO HERE FOR ANYTHING!!!

Outstanding same day service!!!  I was calling around looking for someone to come out and fix my sliding glass door that leads out to the patio. The bottom track that the rollers go on had broken due to wear and tear. I first contacted a company that quoted me $265.00 to repair the door and they would not be able to come out for another week. I then tried K & J Windows due to their 5 star yelp rating. The nice woman and K & J explained that they do not handle repairs and referred me to Rem A D. I contact Rem A D and believe I spoke to Debbie who was very polite and professional. She said she could have someone out there the same afternoon to take a look at the door. She was upfront and stated that they may have to order parts so I wouldn't hear back from her until the following morning with a quote.   Within the hour Alberto was contacting my girlfriend who was at the house. He stated that he was around the corner and could be by in a couple minutes. Alberto diagnosed the problem and quoted us $155.00 to fix it right then and there. He was able to replace the track within a hour and was out the door. The door works perfect and we couldn't be happier with the exceptionally quick and courteous service we received from Rem A D.   I highly recommended giving them a call first if you need any repairs completed on your sliding glass door.

Do not use this guy! I spoke to Keith over the phone and after refusing to discuss the details of what I wanted done over the phone. He had me drive to his house at 6:30am. After arriving at his house we had a 30 second conversation in which he told me he could not complete the work that I wanted. I asked why he couldn't just tell me that over the phone and not waste my or his time and he had no answer.   I believe that is his main sales tool. He has you drive over to his house and once you're there hopefully you'll just accept whatever he is offering to sell you and he's got another sucker. We live in the desert and their are way to many other options out there to tinit your windows....DON"T WASTE YOUR TIME.
