I love shopping here.  It's small, convenient and the staff is remarkably helpful.  It's fresh and fabulous.

A recipient of many awards and much praise, I'm not quite sure what took me so long to visit Lulu's. It's quaint and cute. There was Spanish music on the radio and a silent Syracuse- Notre Dame college hoops game on the flat screen in the corner. It was a nice setting for dinner.  We ordered beef, a lot of it. We got the taco platter- ground beef tacos accompanied with rice and beans and a carne asada burrito. I enjoyed it all and immensely. The tacos were moist and the shells were crisp. The flavor on the rice and beans was just as tasty too. The burrito, which I was only allowed to nibble, was also delish- pico de gio, guacamole, beans, cheese and lettuce accompanied the carne. It was piping hot and exuded freshness. The only negative was that it was a bit greasy.  It was a bit on the pricey side and there's a charge for drink refills-- a mere 70 cents, but knowing the way I can woof down a coke along with Mexican food had me a bit turned off. However, the man behind the counter waived the charge for us which was a pleasant surprise. He was friendly and the food was fast.

Like any discount store, this one is hit-or-miss, depending on the day. I've scored some good deals here in the past with the best coming from off-season merchandise. They carry some of the nicer brands that regular Dillard's stores carry. I go here for men's and women's clothes usually as the home section is pretty weak. A few reject comforters, a couple odds and ends and some sheets. Still, for the clothing selection I'd give it around 3/4 stars.  The issue I have with the store is the customer service or should I say, lack there of. Most of the employees I come into contact with here are rude and off-putting, especially when it comes to the dressing rooms. Once, while shopping for my honeymoon, I came to the dressing room with about 15-20 items. I was adhering to the rule of only bringing the chosen number of items allotted into the room at once. The lady who was working that dressing room that day told me not to try so many things on next time. I'm sorry, WHAT?! I spent around $200 in the store that day and several hours finding outfits for my week-long trip. I should be able to try on as many things as I want as long as I follow the rules of the dressing room. I believe the employee just didn't feel like putting my unwanted things back. She didn't care that I was shopping for a once-in-a-lifetime trip or about to spend a lot of money in her store.   This isn't the only negative interaction I've had at a dressing room either. Several times, I've encountered employees that are annoyed when there's a long line at the dressing room, which is always. And they make it really obvious that you're inconveniencing them by simply trying things on. The problem is, all sales are final so you MUST try things on, but now every time I go to a dressing room, I'm nervous that I'm upsetting the employee. It's odd and uncomfortable.

Eh. It's okay.  Like most clubs in Vegas, the entry line moves at a snails pace and the bouncers with big muscles and bigger egos usher you in with a careful eye and that silly clipboard.   I saw a guy get kicked out of line for wearing sneakers, but once inside I found that more than half of the girls were wearing flip flops so I'm thoroughly confused about the dress code. Since when did it become acceptable to wear flip flops to da club?  It's a scene, but all night clubs in Vegas are.   The dance floor is a bit too small and in an awkward location. There is a pathway where a constant flow of people were interrupting my sweet moves.   The Saturday night DJ was just okay. He played a pretty good array of music but the mix was choppy and had more than a couple awkward pauses.   For guys staying at Luxor or Excalibur, there is a coupon in the booklet given at check-in for two people to get in free to LAX before midnight. This is sweet since the cover charge for guys is $30 or more each usually. Get in line by at least 11 p.m. to make it in before midnight though. Snails pace, remember? Especially if you're just regular folk. ;)  Ladies, you should always get in free and you can drink of free until midnight usually. There is also a ladies line so you don't have to wait as long.

On a recent trip to Vegas, we got roped into the timeshare scam by Grandview Resorts.  We were approached on the strip by a blonde lady named Robin and offered two pairs of free show tickets plus a free buffet breakfast if we could suffer through an hour presentation after. We were told the hotel we'd be touring was just down the strip from where we were staying at Excalibur so we figured, knowing it would be sales pitch that we wouldn't take, two hours of our time was worth two free pairs of tickets. I really wanted to see a show while on vacation.  Um no. All lies.   We boarded a charter bus from our hotel on the strip with a bunch of other suckers around 10 am. We drove for 30 minutes on the freeway. Got off the bus and were ushered into the lobby of some hotel in the middle of nowhere. Upon arrival, there was no food as promised. (The saleswoman on the strip had insisted that we don't eat before we go so we were totally hangry at this point and annoyed that the hotel was so much further than we were told.)  We waited in the lobby until 11 am. Some salesman retrieves us and has us get in another car to travel to yet another property 10 minutes away where we were told the food would be. (We're about an hour in at this point.)  In the car, we told the salesman that we were told the hotel would be on the strip. "This is the strip," he replied. "Technically, we're on Las Vegas Blvd still and this will all be connected by 2020." Seriously, dude?  That's when we asked to be taken back to the hotel and given our money back. We wasted 2 hours of our day. Got no free show tickets, no food and had to argue to get our money back.  Don't fall for the scam! The 2-3 hours does not include travel time. It's more like 4-5. The hotel is not down the strip at all. (They'll tell you anything to get you there.) It's quite far from the strip and in the middle of nowhere.   There are plenty of ways to find discounts in Vegas on shows and other fun. You don't need to attend this scam for free tickets. Totally not worth it.   PS The salesman said we could complain, but warned us that this was such a successful pitch that the company would not care about two people complaining. Comforting.   Shame on you, Grandview!

I (used to) love this bar, but it's gone downhill in terms of service and clientele. We went out for a friend's birthday last night and I was surprised to find that a bar that prides itself on being a neighborhood-type, country bar now charges a cover. (For guys, at least.)  I love the live band and last night was no different. They rocked. I was disappointed to find that the crowd was nearly half the size of what I remember though. The place used to fill up. Maybe it's the cover that's turning people away?   Or maybe it's the bad service....  At the end of the night, we had a difficult time flagging down one of the many bartenders to close our tab because they were preoccupied with cleaning up. When we finally got one's attention, she rolled her eyes, asked for our last name and then replied: 'You opened your tab wayyyy on the other side of the bar.' She rolled her eyes again and then reluctantly fetched it, because, you know, that's her job, and then slapped it down on the bar top before us without so much as a thank you.  We noticed there was a charge for a Jack Daniels ($8.50 for one BTW. Forgot to mention that their prices have gone up.) we never purchased and when we brought this up to another bartender, we got the same amount of attitude and not a single apology.   I've worked in the service industry and certainly understand how, at the end of the night, you're more than ready to clean up and get out of there, but that's no reason to treat your patrons so poorly, especially since the crowd appears to be thinning.  I don't know that we'll be heading to Toby Keith's anytime soon. I'll take a good DJ over their fabulous live music if it means I'm tended to by a mixologist who makes me feel welcomed and appreciated. And maybe one who smiles. :)

My sisters and I got spray tanned here for my wedding a few weeks ago. This is not hyperbole when I say it's the best spray tan I've ever had. It was a little pricier than my past spray tans but it proved the adage right- you get what you pay for. Since I have lighter skin, I have to be careful not to go too dark or I tend to look like an Oompa Loompa. The spray tan from Solar Waves was flawless and long-lasting and made me feel wonderful on my wedding day. I'll definitely be back! Thank you!

5 stars, baby.  Seriously.  I'm an animal lover and a bargain hunter so this place speaks to me. Plus, you can find the best deals on clothing with their great sales.  I usually go on $1 day and I've found some amazing stuff. What separates this store from others, is that they are constantly putting new merchandise on the floor so you aren't just choosing from the picked-over stuff on $1 day, but also on clothing that just hit the floor.   The sales people are so nice too. It's a mix of paid employees and volunteers and all are pleasant and helpful.  They also have a small pet selection where you can get discounted food and supplies for your animal.   Check this place out. You won't be sorry.

I was looking for a new stylist and settled on Shampoo Ink after seeing the reviews on Yelp. I was celebrating a milestone birthday and wanted a new do.  I requested an overall color and ombre highlights. I provided the stylist with two photos of the look I desired and she got started. After more than five hours in the chair (spread out over two appointments), what I got was nice, but just not what I wanted. My total cost after tip was $245. Yikes!  The stylist was very sweet and most of the staff seemed quite friendly but I was put off by the fact that I was charged at the correction appointment too. It felt wrong that I was paying (in time and money) for her mistake. And alas, the overall result was still not quite what I wanted.   I won't return to Shampoo Ink. I felt I was overcharged for a look that missed the mark.

The two stars are for the food. We shared a bleu cheese burger and the wedge salad along with the potato chip appetizer.  While I do think it would be difficult to mess up said items, they were very good.  Then again, perhaps it was only the depth of my hunger pangs that had me thinking so....  We dined on a Friday night before a Suns game a couple weeks ago. Since it was a busy day and time, we gave ourselves ample time to enjoy our meal.  What lured me into Copper Blues was its upstairs location which provided a beautiful view and the live music seeping out the open windows of the patio.  This place looked like the perfect spot for a beer and a burger on that mild January evening. And if the service weren't so poor, it would be.   When we arrived at Copper Blues, there was one couple in front of us at the hostess stand and a large sign that said 'Please Wait to be Seated'.  We obliged.  We waited and waited.  There was not a host in sight so finally the couple in front of us flagged a server down who promptly sat them.  By this time, there were a few more parties in line behind us.  The server, having seen the line that had formed, I assumed would alert the necessary staff and/or return to seat the rest of us still there waiting, but she did not.  Again, we waited.  Five more minutes went by until finally, we flagged down security and he sat us- at a dirty table.  It was quickly cleaned and a smiley and sweet server approached us within a few minutes and asked for our drink order.    We ordered a beer and 2 waters.  We got the beer, about five minutes later, and only one water.  We elected to share it and not complain.  We ordered another beer and the appetizer- potato chips and an onion and sour cream dipping sauce.  She returned about 10 minutes later with the beer and we put in our burger and salad.  Then, we did what I was beginning to see was a theme at Copper Blues- we waited.  The appetizer, which was an item that did not need to even be cooked, took 30 minutes. Then, a full hour after placing our order, our burger came out- with chips instead of fries.  We accepted it anyway and did not complain.  The salad had been forgotten but she assured us it could be out quickly.  The sweet server apologized once more. It was 10 minutes till tip off now.  We hurried through our meal and left just in time to miss only a minute or two of the game. Phew.  When we attended the Suns game the next Friday night, we went to Tilted Kilt instead.  There was not an unrealistic wait for the food and we didn't miss a minute of the game.

I love this place! I've already eaten here twice in the two weeks it's been open. Everything they offer on their menu is fresh and authentic. I had the chicken shawarma plate with a Greek salad, tzikii and baba ghanoush. It was outstanding! They had delicious fresh cucumber lemonade on hand to wash it down too. Mmmmm! Their cream and jello dessert is amazing too so be sure and save room. The service at Tzikii is just as wonderful as the food and the restaurant is clean and inviting. Seriously, you've got to give Tzikii a try. You will be happy you did! :)

We used 3G Photobooths for our wedding a few weeks ago. They were wonderful! They had plenty of props and the open-air concept was able to accommodate big groups-- something important to us with our large family. The attendant was awesome and even turned the booth back on at the end of the night when I (the bride) realized I had yet to get a picture with my bridesmaids. He let me take three more pictures! I would highly recommend 3G Photobooths for a party or wedding. We captured so many great memories this way and the pictures are great quality!

Not sure why but this store is WAY MORE expensive than any other Goodwill I have ever been to. I noticed the clothing, in particular, was much pricier.   Most Goodwills, for instance, sell their workout clothing for around $3.99. I visited this store last night to find workout tops here priced at $7.99, $14.99 and even $17.99. The $18 top, by the way, had deodorant stains all over it. C'mon man. Same with men's ties - $5.99 here as compared to $1.99 at the Goodwill down the street. Whoever is doing the pricing here needs to do a reality check.   I also find this store to be much more bare than its neighboring thrift stores. Reason for 2 stars: the music selection at this location is on point. Seriously killin it with the jams. :)
