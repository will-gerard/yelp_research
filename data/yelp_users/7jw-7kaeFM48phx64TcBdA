I'm confused how this place rates so high. People in Phoenix must have PRETTY low standards.   I went with my sister-in-law and my 7 year old niece for a nice, relaxing 'girls day.'  That's at least the expectation I had going in. Now, my sis in law is from out of town and I usually use someone in the east Valley. So, we wanted to stay close to home. After reading the reviews and considering the location, we decided to use this place. I stopped in during the week to check the place out and to make an appointment. initially the gentleman I spoke with seemed nice, and he looked like he might be the owner. I told him my niece was 7 years old and he said that he would not charge for the service. After telling my sister in law this, she mentioned that a lot of places don't charge for children under a certain age, which seemed like a nice gesture. Sounded like this was pretty normal.  The day of what was supposed to be spa bliss arrives. We eagerly drive over to the nail spa, anxious to get our nails done and relax. The place is nice and clean, I'll give them that, but that's where it ends. I already  had gel polish on my toes. I told the nail tech that I didn't need new gel polish because I had just gotten them done the previous week. All I wanted was the pampering part of the pedicure. This got me some interesting looks from the girls taking care of us. I was all set to be pampered. Let the pampering begin!   They seated us and began the services. We all had pedicures but my niece got her fingers done too. Now, I am no stranger to pedicures, so I know what they should feel like. The nail tech who took care of me did a horrible job! She was just awful! at first I thought she was going to be good but then she began to get really rough with my feet and my lower legs to the point where I thought I was going to have bruises. I don't know if she was just having a bad day, or if that was her normal, but she was really rough with me.   Here's the part that really pisses me off. Remember  when I told you the the owner told me he wouldn't charge me for my 7 year old niece? Well guess what? They did at full price! Not only did they charge my sister in law for my niece, but they did not give me a discount for not getting a gel manicure. I will never EVER go back to this place!   Basically, the moral of the story is if you want to get ripped off, and you like pain, this is your nail salon.

I don't know what people are talking about when they criticize the staff for being rude or the food for being 'bland' or 'tasteless.' I have been to this little sushi place twice and I've experienced nothing negative. In fact, I found the staff quite friendly and welcoming. The sushi chefs stop to enthusiastically greet each customer who walks through the door. Waitresses promptly seat you and take your drink order. I do find it a little weird that they only provide one menu per table, which might be logistically challenging if you have a large group of people. Maybe in that case they bring you two. So far that hasn't been an issue for me since I tend to order from the sushi menu a la carte.   I found the sushi itself to be pretty darned good; not stellar, but pretty tasty. If I were to rate just the quality of the food, I'd give it a solid 7. They have a fairly decent assortment of specialty rolls, which is what I like in a sushi place. I prefer variety and creativity, over the norm. I hate sitting down to sushi only to find the menu selections to be the standard caterpillar, California and dragon rolls. Boooooooor-ing!   To sum up my experience... The sushi was well prepared, tasty and fresh. The staff was friendly and the food came out quickly. Prices are moderate. Overall, I'm happy!   So, would I recommend this place? Absolutely! Will I come back? You betcha! Just save me a seat.

Yes, customer service sucks here if you end up with the old, curmudgeon named Jerry. Everyone else seemed friendly and eager to help. But not Jerry.   Jerry was slumped over the front counter as I walked in. He said,  "can I help you" in such a way that it made me think he'd rather have his leg chewed off by a rabid animal than help me out. My painter had ordered some paint samples for me to try and I was there to pick them up. Through his squinty eyes Jerry looked at me and asked who my painter was in a rather impatient tone. So I told him my painter's name. He scoffed at me and said, "is that the name of the company account it's under?" To which I replied I didn't know. I mean, I've never done this before. How do I know what name the paint is under? What he SHOULD have asked me was what is the PAINTING company's name. To that I answered the correct answer because he nodded his old head in recognition. He disappears into the back room and emerges with a single paint can (I ordered 4). He barks out, "is your name? Such and such? " (he was difficult to understand). I looked at him in agitation and said no. By this time I was annoyed with Jerry and his surly attitude. He once again disappears into the back. Finally, after another 3 minutes he comes to the counter with the 4 cans I ordered. He looks at the receipt, mumbles something unintelligible and thanks me.   Look, I get it. He's an old guy who probably doesn't want to be working. BUT the truth is, whether he likes it or not, he works in a service industry. I expect common courtesy even in a paint store. Don't treat me like some second class citizen because you don't want to be there, because I treat a person the way they treat me. I was not inclined to be nice to Mr. Jerry because he was not very nice to me. And if I had my choice I would not be buying my paint supplies from this store.  Do yourself a favor... Avoid Jerry.

I give this location 1 star because of the less than friendly front desk staff. I understand it's not the most glamorous or the highest paying job, but when a paying member asks you a question, you smile and answer politely. You don't answer in a snotty tone. I am the reason you even HAVE any job in that club. Young people these days forget where their paychecks come from. When I was a teen I worked in fast food all day, on my feet dealing with people who couldn't decide between French fries or onion rings. And yet, I was always friendly and polite. These front desk people sit on their behinds all day scanning memers' fobs. Puh-lease!

Four stars? Really? I'm convinced that the folks in Arizona wouldn't know good sushi if it fell on top of them. This place was okay, very average. Unless you're a local who frequents the place, don't expect the service to be great. (There was a large group at the sushi bar and they new the chef by name.) I didn't feel like my money mattered as much as theirs. Service was a little on the slow side and they weren't particularly friendly. The sushi itself was "eh." Let me just say that there are many more sushi places out there that blow this place out of the water. It's good if you're just looking to satisfy your sushi fix, but if you want REALLY delicious sushi, go elsewhere.

Service is lackluster. No one smiles or greets you. It's like walking into a sleep study, everyone is sleep walking. Order came out wrong and was corrected, but food quality has gone down here. I did not enjoy my breakfast sandwich. Coffee is cold and even after mentioning it to someone, it was still cold after they changed it out. I will not come back here. There are better places I can spend my money.

As I sit here munching on the so-called 'Chopped Salad' I'd ordered for lunch, I contemplate the kind of review I'll give this place. What will I say? Will I mention that they don't know the definition of a CHOPPED salad? The salad I was served was not a CHOPPED salad. Will I mention that when I said something about it to the server she mumbled something incoherently and promptly walked away, not giving a crap about my concerns? Should I mention the kitchen forgot two key ingredients in my $11 salad? Should I write that when I brought it back to the server she yelled back to the kitchen that my salad was made 'all wrong?' Maybe I should mention that the staff didn't know how to handle a dissatisfied customer? Should i put down that the 'manager,' a kid barely out of high school, who could not articulate who he was to me, scrawled on a business card for me to get a free 'chopped' salad on my next visit? No, I won't write any of that.... Here's what I WILL write...   Tom's Thumb is an eatery that needs to get a clue. The food was bland (except for the BBQ sauce that I dumped on my salad. Good stuff!) and the help was clueless, evidenced by the lack of friendliness, helpfulness and complete absence of any customer service skills, whatsoever. The staff is poorly trained both on the the register and the kitchen. My all around experience at Tom's was very disappointing.   So, if you want good food at a great price and friendly service... Go to In and Out Burger.   I'll let you know if the free chopped salad tastes any better...

You would expect a burger place named Char would know how to cook a burger to temperature, but sadly they seem to have a consistent problem with this. Now, that's not to say it wasn't a decent burger, but are there burger joints that do it better? You bet! Hop Doddys and Rehab Burger both in Scottsdale, I think cook a slightly better burger. That being said, why did I rate Char a 4? The service is what kicks this place up a notch. Everyone is so welcoming, including the owner who is from NY and walks the dining room asking his customers how their meal was. Oh, and the fries were pretty good too. The only downsides so far are the burgers and the hostess who walks around like she's on Xanax. I mean, come on, if you're going to hire a hostess then hire one who has a bit more pep and enthusiasm. Honestly, she looked positively bored.

I have been to several conveyor belt sushi places and if you're looking for high quality in ANY of them, you've missed the whole point of conveyor belt sushi. It's not SUPPOSED to be high quality. Think of this as the 'fast food' of sushi dining experiences. You don't go to McDonald's expecting a high quality t-bone steak, do you? As long as you keep your expectations in check you won't be too disappointed in these types of places.   Now, to talk about Teharu SPECIFICALLY, I can say this:  Several reviews have mentioned the sushi is a little 'tired'  looking. I found that to be true. It's nothing special, just kind of slapped together. But then, what do you expect from fast food sushi? You get what you pay for. You want fancy, foo foo sushi, then you need to spend more than $2 a plate. If you have a hankering for sushi but don't want to spend foo foo prices, this place fills a need and your belly, without draining your wallet. I do have to mention that they are cheaper than Sushi Station. And I do think SS edges these guys out in quality and portion sizes, however their most expensive plate is $4.25, while Teharu's is only 2 bucks. Quite a difference. At least this place doesn't charge me a penny for water.   In conclusion, a pleasant experience over all. Hunger satisfied and I enjoyed the sushi. Will I be back? Yes, as long as the water remains free

Tonight I give Tahari ONE star. I don't know which is worse the music or the neglectful service. The sushi was 'meh.' I now believe Sushi Station, while much more expensive per roll is A LOT better than this place. This place wouldn't know good presentation if it fell on them. The rolls are sloppy and unappealing. But what do you expect when the most expensive plate is only 2 bucks? You get what you pay for. Now if they'd just turn up the volume on the obnoxious music, maybe I'd come back... Nah, probably not.

The ONLY reason this place gets stars is for the atmosphere. The restaurant itself is really nice, but that's where the positive review ends. The manager frequently answers these Yelp reviews, which I commend, by saying bad customer service is not the norm. Somehow I doubt that very much. There were extremely long lags between ordering drinks, putting in our food order and finally getting our entrees. Yes, they were busy, but that is not an excuse for slow or poor service. The waitresses were less than enthusiatic. They seemed just BLAH.   Now for the food. After waiting 45 minutes just for the appetizer, finally it came. It was some kind of play on surf (steak)  and turf (shrimp). The steak had good flavor and was cooked nicely, but you could tell it was a cheaper cut. It was SO fatty! The shrimp was just OK. Nothing I'd write to mom about. After that we probably waited another 10 minutes for the main dish. That means it took AN HOUR for our food to arrive. But I digress... I ordered the chicken fajitas. The chicken was so dry and so fatty, it was barely edible. I think they used dark meat and that's why it was on the fatty side. The tiny tortillas make it impossible to really fit much inside of them. Why even bother? The dish does not come with any accompaniments, like sour cream or cheese, like other restaurants offer. No, here they charge you extra for an entree that is already $12. Why not just include the cheese and sour cream and charge $14? That way your customers feel like they're getting their money's worth, because most of the dish was peppers and onions. If the chicken were actually good, I'd want more. The guacamole I paid extra for was bland and looked like it had been made using a mortar and pestil. It was not well incorporated.   Oh, and the chips and salsa! I forgot. The 'salsa' is very watery and had a rather weird after taste. And I didn't like that it was served hot, either. It was like they pulverized peppers and tomatoes together in a food processor and forgot to add seasoning. Extremely bland.   Now, how anyone can say this is the best Mexican food they've ever had, must have left their taste buds at home, but I guess to each their own, right? I really had high hopes for Lanero, but after this experience, I won't be back. For what they charge and the quality and value you get for the money, you're better off going to Chipotle where paying extra for guacamole is worth it.

The only reason this place doesn't rate higher in my book is due to the fact that the owner sits outside and smokes in front of the building. And because the door is left wide open the smell wafts in, it makes sitting in the dining room unpleasant.   The food, I must say, is pretty good from my limited experience there. The pizza was delicious and the staff is super friendly. I think maybe take out might be the solution in order to avoid the smokey dining room.

Always fast and fresh. While not the best sub I've ever had, they are pretty good. I penalized them one star for the service. The people they get to work the register need to exhibit just a smidge of human emotion. You feel like you're being served by zombies. Smile, say hello, be a LITTLE engaging instead of looking at me like I just beat up a bunch of puppies.

Think they may have closed. Stopped by at 4 pm on a Monday. Hours on the door say they are supposed to be open, but they weren't.
