This place was awesome. We ordered our tickets online and I think there was a groupon deal which made the trip even better.  It was obviously hot in Arizona so we wanted to take our kids somewhere fun, other than the normal museums and typical tourist attractions.  We yelped this place and it had pretty good reviews so we decided to try this place out.  There were 3 other families with us so we were a pretty good sized group.  The place was easy to find right off of the freeway.  We're from California so it wasn't our home and it was easy to locate.  We arrived in the parking lot and there was a ton of parking.  There just isn't a ton of shade.  Be warned, if you have leather seats, your car will be very hot and your seats even hotter.  We tried to guesstimate where the sun would move to face our cars away from it so that the cars would be a tad bit cooler.  After parking, we headed to the line.  It wasn't that difficult.  You have to pay for everyone.  Babies aren't free.  Please take note of that.  They do go in the pools after all.  Also, they only allow water bottles. This is pretty typical of any "amusement" type park.  They check everything so be prepared to open your bags and empty out your strollers.  Getting in wasn't too much of a hassle especially with such a large group like ours.  After getting through the front gate, we were well on our way.  This water park has something for everyone.  It isn't a large water park.  The wave pool takes most of the room but it's a definite must try when you are in the park.  The best feature about this park are the slides for the kids.  Most parks cater only to adults and big kids or at least kids that aren't afraid of large slides and big pools.  This water park has more than just 1 slide for little kids like mine.  They have about 4 or 5.  Then there's pool that they can swim in and just walk around and/or play in.  There's also a baby pool but that's clear on the other side of the water park.  There's a snack bar too but of course it's pretty expensive. There are little meal deals that they offer but of course, you should either eat little small snacks and meals before the water park, order small snacks at the water park, and/or eat a large meal after the water park.  We did all of the above and saved a ton of money especially for our big bunch.  There's a small little shop off to the side after the entrance gate if you forgot something like sunglasses, water undies for the little one, sunblock, etc.  The prices aren't actually outrageous so that was a definite plus in my book, especially with my 4 boys eating me out of house and home.  When in Arizona, we will definitely be back here.

This place is truly amazing.  It's off the strip but located in an area that's easy to get to.  The lobby is truly inviting and so are the staff members as you walk through the lobby.  The pool area is located in the middle of the property complete with chairs, beds tables, fire pits, picnic tables and barbecues. The fitness center is off to the side area near the pool. It's a little small but it does it's job. Each unit comes stocked with the necessities, bedding, plates, utensils, cooking gear, etc.  Great place to stay or even visit if you have friends and you want to barbecue and hang out.

This place is SOOO expensive. I couldn't believe how much a burger costs and a pizza.  I mean they were good but really, I could feel my entire army of kids with 1/3 of what we paid for both of these meals.  To make matters worse, I didn't know where the heck to pick up the pizza we ordered.  There weren't any signs or anything.  We stayed on the left side near the fridge because we ordered on that side.  We received our drinks and our burger on that side but when I asked about our pizza, the workers were looking at me oddly and then treated me horribly like I was supposed to know to pick up the pizza on the other side.  Really people.  I want to give this place even less stars but the food was actually good.  Boo to getting food at the airport and rude people.
