We come here every now and then, its fun and gets your adrenaline running. Haven't had their food yet, but the racing is enough for me. It sucks to be stuck behind some people but they're generally good with flagging those drivers for you to pass if you're faster. Don't really like the mew location, but we still drive there...

Pretty awesome food. Had the gyro, greek fries, and salad. The calamari was alright, was not too impressed. Customer service was good. Parking is kind of hard depending on time of visit. Quick service though! Definitely coming back!

You just can't go wrong here.  In N Out is just AMAZING. They're fast, but their speed does not take away their quality. Yum yum.. don't forget to ask for some spread..

Average service, ehh food wise, was not impressed. Didn't really enjoy my visit there... I rather eat elsewhere for better quality food.

One of my favorite buffets in the valley. They always have fresh food, everything is well stocked. My family always end up here when we can't decide where to go!

Customer service is everything to me. Yes, they do have a lot of stuff and sometimes they have GREAT deals. Their customer service is a hit or miss. I'm gonna avoid coming here now. I ordered shoes with them paid for it and the items were sent back because I didn't pick it up in 10 days... Was NEVER aware of that and the lady was like, "Oh, you dont want your stuff" I didn't appreciate that comment. If that was the case, I wouldn't be here. I have also paid for it. SMH.

Avoid if possible unless you want to hear nonstop gossip while you're getting work done. I stayed due to low cost (no out of pocket), but they're horrible. Expect them to mess up somehow, some way or hurt you. I regret going to them for the past few years. Glad I finally left as they lied and denied responsibility for their neglecence.

I've done lunch and dinner here. Favorite time is when their crab legs and lobster claws are out. Totally worth the drive and cost. Their oysters are huge as well... too bad they dont have baked oysters just raw. Many desserts to choose from, I don't like the cake though its pretty dry and sometimes has the refrigerator scent. Many ice cream flavors though! Creme brulee is also availability along with fruit tarts.

Its good. Legit buffet for $26.95. A little overrated, a little more expensive than your typical buffets, but the food is better than other typical buffets around town. I'll go back if craving king crab or lobster claws because thats what makes the visit worthy... Servers generally sucks(a lot of waiting & constantly having to ask for water & drinks) but the buser is really attentive(always).

One of my favorite jewelry store.. I've been going here for years and have referred many people. The owner is pleasant to deal with. Prices are really fair. Limited variety on gold items but you can always make a request. Great variety of sterling silver and fun jewelry!
