What a great little family owned joint!  Everyone is so friendly here, and this is one of those ran places that the family runs the place, and knows the majority of the patrons by name.  I love right here in the neighborhood, and can't believe it's taken me this long o discover this gem.  If you're ever in the old town area, it's worth the trek over here to casella's to grab a sandwich.  I recommend the hot Italian beef which was outstanding!  I will no longer be going to Subway and encourage you to do the same.  Let's keep the dollars local, and hit up Casella's where the sandwiches are easily twice as good!

Zizzo is top notch!  Outstanding work, and the service is second to none.  The owner is super friendly and welcoming, and isn't shy about offering up skilled expertise to help guide you in the right direction with regards to the proper alterations that need to be done.  It's great to have a local and affordable tailor (I was going to Nordstrom before, and must have been smoking crack between the high cost, and spotty service), and I am certain that you'll always walk out with a smile on your face when taking your business to Zizzo.

I've been coming to Shannon G for 3 years, and she has magical !  I've also referred several friends, both guys and girls, and every one of them has become a regular.  Highly recommend Shannon and the salon!!!

We absolutely love Hofbrauhaus, and always make it a point to swing by here whenever we're in vegas.  Nothing beats a cold stein of Dünkelweis and a plate of Jagerschnitzel acoompanied by live German bands and 30 foot horns!

Great local sourced food, with creative twists.  Plenty of healthy and vegan options, and don't forget to try the Breakfast Buzz

My girlfriend and I are always on the search for good and truly spicy food, and when we saw the living social coupon for Jalapeño Inferno, we were pretty intrigued.  Unfortunately our experience was very underwhelming.  After a long wait before seeing a waitress, we ordered a couple of their "premium" margaritas, which we both thought were just okay, a little on the sour side, and overall, lacked balance.  We ordered the smoked pork quesadilla and the Texas style enchiladas to split for dinner.  It always bugs us a bit when something is listed as "not for the faint of heart" due to it's spiciness, and it comes out medium spicy at best.  The management is super nice, and offered to buy us an app for our initial wait.  One of the managers also recommended a puréed hatch child sauce which made things much better, and had a nice kick, but we felt this should have been somehow infused in the dishes.   Ambiance was kind of all over the place, and we would have liked to have had some more traditional Mexican type of music as opposed to the pop channel they had on.  Service seemed to be good around us, but I think that our server was just over sat, and forgot about us after our food came out.  Over all, we wouldn't recommend this for spicy food enthusiasts or authentic Mexican food connoisseurs, but we think that it'd probably be a good place for families.

The Pork shoulder tacos were outstanding, as was the tostada appetizer and the elderflower Paloma.  A very creative and well thought out menu paired with a charming, warm and romantic ambience.  This is certainly my new favorite in Old Town Scottsdale!

The Lodge is a kitschy sports bar with good bar food and energetic vibe and in general a nice break from the glitz and glamour of every other bar surrounding it in Old Town Scottsdale.  In particular, we love riding our bikes  down and sitting on the patio to watch football games on Sunday.  Late night, the Lodge turns into more of what you'd expect from a busy bar scene in Old Town, but I agree with other reviewers who mention that you don't necessarily get the brawlers that you run into at bars nearby.    Foodwise, we've had just about everything on the menu, and we haven't been disappointed by anything.  Our favorite item is the Turkey Burger which is outstanding, and if you have someone visiting from out of town, its fun to challenge them to eat the Sasquatch burger which uses two grilled cheeses as a bun for a burger.  In general, you just can't go wrong with the Lodge.

Great place for Sunday brunch and late happy hours.  Very chill atmosphere with unique ambiance.  Food is all above average to pretty good, and has some unique selections that you won't find elsewhere.  Great brunch atmosphere, and you can't beat the bottomless Bloody Marys and Mimosas.   Gotta love the bacon in the bloody mary by the way!   Live music at times throughout the week, and we like to head down on Thursdays for a chill drink our two around 8:30.   My only gripe is that their beer selection is very blasé and only offer the run of the mill bud light, miller light, coors light, etc..  A couple unique craft beers like IPA's and Hefeweizen's would be a nice match for their unique environment.  As a marketing guy, I love RnR's embrace of using social networks to market their product, and if you like RnR be sure to friend them on Facebook as they post good specials on a daily basis.   Must try:  Animal Fries, Chambord Margarita & Grilled Cheese Stay away from:  Beer Selection

Hidden gem at the Talking Stick!  This place is awesome!  If you like creole food, and spicy dishes, this place on a corner of the casino is worth the wait that there usually is.  We've been several times, and our favorites are the pan roasts and gumbo.  Just be careful with spice levels...  I generally ask for hotter than the hottest level of spice that most places offer, but the 10 (on a scale of 1-10) is comparable to ghost pepper.  The one time that I made this mistake, the food was still great, but it took me about 1/2 hour to finish it :)  Even if Ocean Trail is a bit out of your way, I highly recommend swinging by TSR, and checking it out.

We had a great experience here for my birthday dinner this evening.  My brother recommended this venue after he and his wife had dinner on the patio, and we were actually fortunate enough to have the same waiter (Will), who put it over the top for us.  Whether you're from the Valley, or are visiting, we highly recommend the views and the food at Orange Sky.

My girlfriend and I were both skeptical about any kind of Vegas buffet, but this one blew us both away.  Cinammon walnut French toast and red velvet pancakes are to die for!  If you like Mimosas or bloodies for brunch, get the bottomless option for just a few dollars more.  Well worth the trek regardless of the hotel your staying at.

Great sports bar.  New, but has the feel of a place that's been around for awhile.  The quesadilla is good, and the sunday drink specials are great!  Thanks Thunder Dan for opening one of your joints in our neighborhood!

Just wrapped up my second purchase of a car from the folks at Town and Country, and had another great experience.  I love supporting locally family owned businesses, and this is a business that I will continue to return to.  I feel as though some of the prior reviews on here are a bit unfair, from people who had an axe to grind. I didn't feel pressured at all in the sale, and they were very helpful in putting me into the right vehicle... Their pricing was fair, and everyone was nice, throughout the entire process.  With a little negotiating I got fair value for my trade-in (also purchased from Town and Country), and felt comfortable throughout the buying process...  Or as comfortable as you're going to feel when purchasing a car, I suppose. I highly recommend Jim and his team at Town and Country, and will be doing business with them again when I'm back in the market for a vehicle again!

For a place that specializes in breakfast, we would expect quite a bit more.  We've been here 6 times now, and there's some good, and a lot of mediocre.  We frequent a lot of the breakfast spots here in Scottsdale (Breakfast Club, Daily Dose, etc.), and this place doesn't stack up.  While the service (we had Sam recently, and she was awesome) and the ambience are very good, the food just lacks anything that wows you.  There are two things that we'd recommend.  First, the waffles with the seasonal berries and granola are good (the granola puts it over the top).  Second, the smoothies are pretty darn good.  This place is also great if you wanna bring your pooch(es), as they are very dog friendly, and everyone there seems to love dogs as much as we do. Beyond that, the omelets and other standard breakfast fare are okay at best.  We had a really bad experience with the Chorizo (steer clear!), which was gamey (my fiancée validated), and presented very lackluster on a side plate (I'll post the picture right after the review).  We've also tried the Huevos Rancheros, various omelets, and breakfast sandwiches, and they've all been sub par.  I hope that this kitchen gets it together, as this place shows a lot of promise, but this place unfortunately just doesn't stack up to the local competition.

We had a good experience here.  The ambiance was great, and the servers were very friendly and attentive.  Our only complaint was that the lobster risotto was VERY bland, and for a $24 dish, we expected a bit more.  However, the penny shots of Fireball, thanks to out Yelp checkin, more than made up for it.  Overall, I'd give EVO a .

Just moved into the neighborhood, and this was our first time here.  All of the employees are great, and he hostess in particular is super sweet!  The ambiance is very welcoming, and they have a really fun Bloody Mary bar to tempt you, just inside the front door.  My Preggo wife couldn't decide between entrees on the super creative breakfast menu here, so we went for 3 choices, the Lump Crab Sweet Potato Hash, the Huevos Rancheros Hash and the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes... My pregnant wife's dream come true!  And all 3 were Excellent.  We'll be back, and can't wait to try one of the 20 or so other tempting items here.
