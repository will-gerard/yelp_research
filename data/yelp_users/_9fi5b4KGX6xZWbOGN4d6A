The service was appalling. They left us on the back patio and forgot about us.  When something was said, they didn't seem to care.  We left and went to Phoenix City Grill.

Every meal that I have eaten there has been wonderful.  The breakfasts are awesome and the bread that they use is some of the best I have had.
