Yes Go to China Chili!  I was tipped off by a friend to this place...a little bit out of my "hood" but what the hey.  For starters they are good about QUALITY, Yeah I said it QUALITY. We could make wonton soup and let it get mushy and bland. China Chili's is very fresh tasting...lots of mildly crunchy cabbage...YUM!  My husbands new love affair with Singapore Noodles was once again renewed. He ate almost the entire (giant) portion.  I was intrigued by Pillow Chicken (where do you find this at other places?...you don't!). Chicken and water chestnuts wrapped in a light almost rice dough...with black pepper sauce. All the right combinations working together to make a great dish!  Will we go back..YES! Now we just have to drive a bit further to great Chinese cuisine.

Wow this place has gotten a LOT of bad reviews! I am surprised. I do not consider this a bad place. I was stuffed from the 6 meat sauce plus homemade noodles, my husband had the Oso Busco. It is small, but they do not force you out or make you feel uncomfortable talking over your meal (unlike some other restaurants).  My food was lovely and a generous portion, we did have desert and coffee as well.  For those of you who had a bad server or a bad run in with "the boss" I did not have that experience at all. The service was friendly, and the boss was helping some VERY nasty people at a table near us and trying to be accommodating as best as he could. I never am one to complain about decore or seating, if you are giving me good food, I will sit on a stump, so the plastic chairs do not bother me. I would say give it a try....

Went to Capital Grille for resturant week Pre Fix menu. I guess I was expecting more. The atmosphere was plesant and the service was not all that bad (waiter was at our table a little too much, interrupting conversation). The salad was ok. I could have had better elsewhere....lettuce was wilted. The filet was ok. My steak was not cooked very evenly and for a five star steak house I was expecting a perfect steak. It also had very little flavor itself. The port wine reduction helped with the flavor. The side was nice a truffle mac and cheese...but again nothing to write home about. Dessert was good. Pumkin cheesecake, my husband had the apple crisp. Would I go back and pay full price. NO. This is not a place for something new or different and the quality was below par.

I am part Italian...so my husband and I have a VERY difficult time finding a restaurant that meets my expectations. So far this is the only one I will go back to. I was impressed that you could order a $48 pasta dish...but my husband and I ordered off the regular menu (not the specials). The chef does know his pasta and sauce! I ordered the Mare Y Monte (Land and Sea) pasta with shrimp. It had the quality ingredients, and no complaints on using FRESH tomato...this is what pasta sauce should be made with. My husband had clams and pasta....the pasta was Lovely!  Yes there was opera inside (beautiful), we chose to sit on the patio (a tad bit noisy because of street traffic).  The food and patrons may not be in my tax bracket....but I am willing to try it again (once I save up my change!)

Does anyone else think chips and salsa are part of the foodgroups? I do! Yes this is a hole in the wall, yes it is in a scetchyer "hood"  but it will be worth your time.  Margarita's...check out their 2.99 deals or just for the heck of it get a piture and share with some friends.  The atmosphere can be loud (decor and patrons alike), but for this reason, it is a good place to bring kids because no one cares when your kids are as loud as your adults. On to the food....Chimis are great, my husband always gets the heart attack style (this is not the name) chimi with white cheese sauce. There are a lot of vegitarian options here for all you non carnivores. If you are looking for good mexican food and mostly chips and salsa that should be part of the food pyramid, then Via Delosantos is your place.

Had a wonderful birthday dinner at CIBO last night. This was about the 3rd or 4th time visiting this quaint house turned restaurant, and now is the time to YELP.  CIBO has wonderful appetizer of antipasti that played with my taste buds! Fun to make your own brushettas....  My husband and I shared the Rustica delightful, delicious, delectable....  And the creps...what can I say...I didn't need it, but I wanted it, so I had it, so there! Fresca creps with fruit, vanilla ice cream and fresh whip....Mmmm...food coma. Lovely service and birthday!

Schnitzel, Spatzle, and Pretzel oh my! Did I mention beer too?  These are just a few of the reasons I love (and you will too) Haus Murphy's. Set in Old Town Glendale one may not think to look for this gem.  I recommend the Jager Schnitzel: Mushrooms in brown gravy with a delightful piece of fried pork....hungry yet?  My husband swears by the sausages, and beer served here. I agree with him on the beer...You are allotted a GIANT beer (if so desired, and frankly who wouldn't desire this?) with lovely flavor.  The staff is friendly and helpful. Check this one out! Zer Goot!

Delightful. As good as cupcakes can get! I was given these cupcakes as a gift, and it prompted me to stop in. I tried the peanut butter cupcake, think Reeses Pieces....Double chocolate (my son devoured), and chocolate with a cream cheese topping....All were fresh and wonderful. The place and packaging is super cute too....Looks like they have a repeat customer :)

Went to Joe's on a whim and it payed off!  The food was diner fare with a twist on modern. Many have stated before the fontina burger is OMG! Oozing with fontina cheese, mushrooms, red peppers and farm goodness. So get it, you will be grateful to cows.  I was eying the people who ordered pizza and almost asked for a slice to try...but alas bad form.  Will I go back, sure...the drive is a little daunting but the food is oh so appealing.

Chompies is our "go-to" place when no one can agree on what they want for dinner. They cater to kids very well, both of my offspring love eating here because they can order a cup of soup or a grilled cheese. I have to say that I have never had a bad meal here. The wait staff is very kind (we usually leave a small tornado after leaving). There are nightly specials which my hubby loves. I am a fan because it is not a packaged food place like Chili's or Applebees.

Chicken n' Waffles. There was a man sitting across from me that I almost did not claim as my husband, because of the utter pleasure he was taking in the fried chicken. To quote him "I am not sure that I can ever eat fried chicken again after this....it was just too good."  The hallowed chicken was also married with a savory waffle and grilled green beans. Flava Flave! That was the end of our meal...and to be frank everything else was pretty damn tasty. One more quote from the old ball and chain "if you can make SALAD tasty, you know what you are doing!"  Starters were cheese curds that are battered and deep fried and so they ooze out and send wonderful cheese into a blissful place....ok don't start me on cheese. Then crÃªpes filled with chicken and caramelized onion (oh how I love a savory Crepe). Mac and cheese was so so good....and dates stuffed with chorizo on a bed of arugula. It was the perfect mix of sweet, spicy, and savory all at once. The atmosphere and service also gets two big "hollas" but to be honest, serve me this food on a busy intersection and I would be happy too. Rocks.

I heard about Press through a search trying to find local (non-chain) coffee houses. Yes Press is all that.. a bean/barista aficionado goodness. Yes it is difficult to find up at City North, next to the overshadowing drone of Desert Ridge...Ok but enough about that.  My great gal pal and I went on the hunt for some splendid coffee. I always try the Cafe Mocha, because I feel this is a true test of a coffee house (that is my own weird test, but a good one). The Barista TOOK TIME to make the coffee! WOWEE! That alone was impressive, in the world of fast food and fast coffee somewhere care has been lost. This man cares about his coffee. And the result was glorious, not too hot, not sticky sweet, but a perfect coffee and mocha blend...ahh.  The Egg Sandwich was lovely too...and once again the chef (took their time) to make something.  So the question is will I go back? Yes. I am sad that it is at City North (a virtual ghost town) but I am riveted by a good, make that great cup of joe. I may need to try the wine as well....hum.

I have been going to Camelback Pediatrics since I was a kid (woo hoo, I feel old). Now my own children go there as well. We primarily see Dr. Alexander who is extremely knowledgeable and has a great bedside manner with the kids.  He gives great medical advice and is there to listen to parent concerns. The nursing staff I have never had a problem with, I know there are a few Doctors I would rather see than others. Linda is a fast talker when you try and make phone appointments. I would like to say I would find a practice closer to home/ work that I would trust, but our family has been going to this practice for close to 34 years, it is too difficult to chose something else when I know they are great!

Matt Carter hits this one out of the park! Yeah for having something delightful in downtown phoenix. SO many good things to say. The ambiance was modern/urban and fit the downtown vibe. But on to the food! We had a very hard time deciding on the apatizers so we ended up with a few. First the shrimp lettuce wraps. So delicate and flavorful (do not expect a giant prawn) my favorite of the three we tried. Next the duck and foi gras dumpling...a complexity of flavors that my husband LOVED. Finally we had the pork belly creps. The chef has some sort of pork panash....it was amazing amazing amazing! Entrees were ramen noodles with duck egg and more pork belly (this still haunts my husband because of the richness of the flavors). Shrimp fried rice for me. This is not your everyday run of the mill shrimp fried rice. I could eat this regularly.... Finally desert (my husband wanted the octopus sashimi lol). Chocolate cake with ginger. Go you will not regret it....you can eat dinner off of the apatizer menu and be a happy camper

I went here today with a my family that was in town....The service was VERY bad. It took a LONG LONG time to get the food and it was not busy at all. The food itself is overpriced and unfortunately not worth the money or the wait. This place needs to get its act together quick because it does not take close to one hour to prepare a sandwich!

5 guys is a fun place to go for a "I need a stack of meat!" fix. Whoever the 5 guys are, they take pride in an overfilled burger with toppings oozing out the sides! Thank you for the THICK cut tomato and grilled onions....mmmmm. Licked my fingers more than once after polishing off a double patty (I think I will pass on eating dinner now, thanks). The fries are thick cut and full salt (more finger licking). No, I am pretty sure there is not a healthy item on the menue...so this is a treat...but a welcome one. As far as the pricing goes...yep it is a bit pricey...but I can spend $6-7 on a "value" meal at a fast food joint...why not get some real meat and toppings for a few bucks more...Share the fries there is more than enough to go around :)

Third time in today. This mini-mart converted into hamburger making awesomeness does not disappoint. Onion rings with panko breading, yes please! Hamburger with rocket sauce, heck yah! Cheese curds, any flavor of soda you would ever want and then some....must stop drooling.  I need to go here more often, the service is great. The owner is always there, he treats you like a person.  My 5 year old ate the WHOLE burger tonight, this was after doing some sort of moon dance because I mentioned we were going to Rocket Burger. Burgerlishious!

Mmmm. I have found a new love and its name is yogartini!  I love getting what I want and adding what I want and the combinations at this fro-yo shop are outstanding. It is a great place to have a treat and escape the AZ heat at the same time.  I had the peach yogurt with berries and granola to top it off. My son had cookies and cream, marshmallow topping and cookies on top (with gummy worms...he is 3!).  The bad part it is that there is LESS guilt so you get more in your giant cup-o- yogart....but a treat is a treat, and this one is delicious!

I am not one to give out one stars...so this is going to be difficult. I went to Moon Valley cafe in the hopes of getting Mexican food (they own the place next door), but during the day this portion of their restaurant is closed.  Waited for the server for quite a while. I ended up with a beef sandwich and my son had a burger. I order some to go items from their other restaurant for the rest of the family.  The sandwich was dry and flavorless. My son (who usually eats a whole burger) only ate a small amount of his food and said he didn't like it. The wait for the food and check was VERY long.  Finally was able to get the attention of the waitress....for check and to go items.  The food was overpriced, to go items were nonexistent. Sorry I am not waiting another hour for a burrito.  Not going back.

Can I push this nasty half star from a full five problem over the edge....? Don't know, don't care. In my professional life of eating an assortment of awesome tacos, this one is pretty stellar and gets my FULL FIVE! I crave taco tastiness in fine establishments and dirt holes (this is neither of the above). If they have good food, who cares, right? Atoyac (I pronounce I-O Tech...but my Spanish is not that great, I think it is Ah Toy ach) is SADLY not open on Sundays or Mondays. This is sad because I usually need some sort of tasty awesomeness to beat Mondays. That being said I will take Taco Tuesday! Try every kind. I have not had the CABESA yet. I am working my way up to it...like a runner. My friend and I ordered about 24 tacos for our work group. The guy taking our order swears he has had that many in one sitting. Wow that is dedication to your job. Gold star. Others swear by the burritos served here. I guess I will have that as my side next time I go there. Is it Tuesday yet?

We went to Sekong by Night last night. It was some goodness! We had divine spring rolls, soup that reminds me of Pho (one of my ultimate favorite soups), beef and noodles, and Shrimp with a black pepper sauce.  My general descriptions are not doing this place justice.  It is a tad difficult to find...so look between the Aurthur Murry Dance Studio and the 99 cent store. The atmosphere was very relaxing, service was outstanding, and price for portions were great! I was skeptical to try...but my Yelp friends have yet to steer me wrong. I ended up with a satisfying and tasty dinner :) Lets fill this place up with patrons! It is Sekong super yummy!

My friends and I went for an early Sunday brunch here. The hostess asked if we had a reservation, "no", to which she said it was recommended. The restaurant was half empty. The strawberry scones were a nice touch. Wish they had a larger coffee selection.  I am rating two stars for service. We waited a very very long time for ordering, getting drinks, getting food and getting the check. I am fairly certain our waitress had some issues one of them being telling us an awful story about another guest. Rule #1 of customer service, don't talk about other customers!  The food came out lukewarm and it was ok. I had a goat cheese and mushroom omelet . I am surprised this place remains a hot spot for "ladies who lunch" when there are much better offerings elsewhere.

Supa Zupas! Ok enough of that. Went the other day for lunch, and the staff handled a relatively large crowed with ease and efficiency. I like that food is made to order and that their lunch meat is not over processed. I was expecting the salad and soup combo to be a smaller version half and half, but it was the WHOLE thing. That is amazing for the price and it is decent fare.  Enjoyed the Italian Soda mix in's. But, as someone else said fresh brewed iced tea would be nice.  This is a great location for them and I see that they have ventured into something that just may stick in a strip mall back corner....we shall see. Oh and ask for a chocolate covered strawberry they are awesome! A tiny notch down from Wildflower or Nordstroms Cafe (why the 4 star)...but a good soup, salad, sammi place none the less.
