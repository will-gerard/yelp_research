my go to spot for Polzole. Very flavorful and layered with spices. Salsa bar is great and so is the escabeche. Lame this is they charge for chips and soda refills. For this they get knocked down to 3 stars.

Another one of Joe's great places. Been coming here for over 3 years now and have yet to be disappointed in anything. Been to the community dinners too. If you have not it's a must. Differently should put the duck confit enchiladas on the menu PLEASE!!!

My go to place for short rips and tri-tip. Growing up around the Santa Maria Valley I'm the king of tri-tip. While they don't always have it in the case, give them a few hrs notice and they will cut to order.  The bacon is great too. Keep it up guys.

Went today for lunch. This IS THE ONLY TIME you should go. We arrived at 10:30a and we only had around 6 people hanging out in front. Good thing because this place is so over hyped we thought we'd be in for an hour wait. Doors opened right at 11a and we were seated right away. Litle rushed to order but if you are here you should already know what you want because you have researched it over and over dreaming of the day you go.   I'm going 4 stars not because of the pizza(3stars) but because i was transported back in time to when i was 10 growing up in(movie Sideways was filmed here)  Santa Ynez, Ca. When I was a kid, an older couple moved to the Valley from Rome and opened up a small pizzeria called The Roman Kitchen. The smell of Bianco reminded me of the old wood/brick oven they would fire everything in. To this day by far the best pizza I've ever had R.I.P. Roman Kitchen.  Overall the pizza was good pushing towards great. But not worth a hour wait. Then again I do not feel any food is worth that wait. Will I be back? Yes, only for lunch, for I do not care to stand around for hours for some pizza.   I do thank you for the flash back in time.

why cant you give zero stars??? This place is trash all the way around. If I witness another fight in the food court I might just join in a give some stupid kid a beat down. Oh, and don't even get me started on mall security at the place. Wonder why every store is pulling out!!!! When a cheap ass store like Forever21 pulls out, you know the mall is bad. Just look at the photo of the needle and used condom wrapper i came across in the parking lot.

I've been twice now and this place ranks with Ra as being top nasty sushi place. People that rate a place on rolls should not comment on "freshness". Rolls are for people that eat sushi to be cool. Eat the sashimi and then rate. Anyways, had the large sashimi plate. Fish was warm, not on ice and the albacore about made be puke. It's easy to dress up bad fish with rice and sauces but not sashimi. Fish was glossy and opaque......... Never again!!

I love every place on South Mountain. I've been wanting to try a Monte Cristo for awhile now. The wait was well worth it. Massive flavor explosion in the mouth. Finished it off, chased it with fresh lemonade, and seriously wanted to order round two. For sure will be back next week for that second one.

I'm all about the Sunrise on cheddar w/ turkey sausage. Great selection of fresh made bagels. Good deals on day old too. They need salsa to offer with the breakfast selections

OMG the blue cheese/honey!!!!!!!!!!!!! So damn good. While we usually go to wholefoods for our filling of S.R. we went up to scottsdale to hit the store. Thing the ice cream is a little different at the store then at wholefoods. Must be the temp and freshness.  I recommend this ice cream to anyone that love to try new funky lovers. Is say its on par with Double Rainbow from San Francisco

So over priced!!! Check the cost of the Vans OTW collection. They double the msrp on them. OTW's cost no more then $85 at other stores. Great business practice. I even email these clowns six months ago about this issue. They claimed it was an uploading issues with the price point. Really, takes over six months to fix it? SQUIDS!

I've been going to this place for 4 years with 5 different cars. NO MORE!!! Took my Mazda in for a wash and oil change. The pulled the usual "your transmission oil is really dirty" No its not i just had mazda change it less then 1k ago. They pulled the same with my lady's honda too. Wanted $165 but were "having a deal today" $120. No thanks Honda is $65. Anyways, they call and say my air filter is very dirty and needs to be replaced. I say go for it. After 2 hrs of hang out I get my car. Drive down power and at every stop light my car dies. I turn around and take it back to them. At the front desk I tell the lady whats going on and she gets a supervisor. I explain to him what's going on and he takes my keys and checks it out. After about 20min he comes back and says the during the air filter instal that my intake tube broke and that it needs to be replaced. Ok cool when will you guys fix it? He starts in saying that its not his fault and that its plastic and these things happen. That he would do me a favor and ALLOW me to purchase the replacement part at cost from them. Yeah sorry buddy not going to work on me. When I asked for his manager he proceeded to tell me that his manager "will just tell me the same thing" really go get him and have him say it face-face. Needless to say the manager never come out. The kid came back with an incident report for me to fill out. His manager was going to take care of it. A day later they call and say my part is in and I can come in anytime before closing and they would put in on for me.(they put a band-aid on it by wrapping the tube in electrical tape) Show up at 6pm No one has any idea where the part is. After 45min the dude finds it and ask when will i come back to have it installed , because no one was around to do it. I just grabbed it out of his hands and walked to my car. I did it my self. Never will I go back to Danny's

One of only two places I buy meat. Highest quality pork and grass fed beef in AZ. Follow on Facebook and get Deals of the Week info. Ordered my 5lbs of pork belly and 3lbs pork tenderloin for my porchetta I made for Thanksgiving. Best stuff ever.

Id say 3 stars but since the have menudo everyday and prepare it at order I'll go 4. Street tacos are good so is the carne asada.  Typical gringo "Mexican" food.

Heaven,  the way Mexican food should be! Dogfish tacos are the bomb! Salsa and guacamole are great too.  If you want true tacos this place is a must.

If you can look past the lame teens working here you will enjoy some big tasty cupcakes.  I've order a custom cake from here too and it was very good, full of flavor, and very moist. Being a retail manager I'm put off by the kids that work here. They must be family of the owners. If I had as many reviews expressing dissatisfaction with my counter help I'd have new staff within days.

Good little place in old town across from Cowboy Ciao. Had the turkey apple swiss wrap w/ dried cranberries,local greens, smoked bacon, and cashews. Very good and great size. The lady had the grilled chicken & sage pesto sandwich w/ goat cheese, gala apple, and smoked bacon. She liked it as well. The sweet potato chips were very good too. will be back for sure.

Growing up in Santa Barbara I've been telling every  one on the In N Out bandwagon in az about The Habit for years. Santa Barbara is home to the original one. Thank you Habit for bringing me a little piece of home to AZ. The burgers are so good, the Malts and the albacore sandwiches man. Mouths watering now. People in California don't really go to In N Out  that much. Az is way behind the times in this regard. Do yourself a favor and eat The Habit!  Food: the ones in Santa Barbara are better. The burger didn't have the same char flavor and has a little on the salty side. Establishment: nice looking, on par with all the other trendy burger places. Definitely like the old school walk up ones back home better. Overall: B+

Great light breakfast or snack anytime. Been a few times with the lady. Fresh made peanut butter is very good and a must add in.

Very bad customer service. Avoid like the plague. Ordered some Oakley frames. They charged me $190 then said it would take 1-2 weeks to get in. SOOO 2 weeks go by and I call. Oh, he's not in, I have him call you friday when he gets in(this was on tuesday). Friday no call, sat no call and monday no call. Go in on tuesday(week3) Oh, the Oakley rep is bringing them today, you should have them by thursday. Thursday no glasses, friday no glasses. Again, Tuesday i go in and get. Oh, they are in our lab and you should have them by 5 tonight. Nope didnt get them. Call on Friday, and ask the retards if that S.O.P. at Woolf to charge for an item and not produce it? Anyways, after 5 weeks I got my $190 back and went down the street to Lens Crafters and got them. These guys are clowns!

Since when did a wine place become a kids place. Went with the lady on a sunday at about 10:45. By noon we were surrounded by moms with 2-3 kids all over the place. One even had a bunch of baby food with her, Tacky!!!! Other then that, place is great. Had the butcher block. Def be back. Hopefully this time its not "bring your kid day" at the wine bar.
