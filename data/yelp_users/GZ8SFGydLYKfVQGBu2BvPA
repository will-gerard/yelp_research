I got the worst gel manicure here last week. The lady was giving me attitude about my choice of colors. The gel on my thumb was all lumpy when I left. 5 days later the gel is peeling off and my nails are breaking. I won't be coming back here again.

Been here twice after nightmares at Fletcher's, and the guys here always take great care of me. Great prices, EXCELLENT customer service and the waits aren't too bad. I will only come here for my automobile needs from now on. Definitely recommend.

I'm seriously so over sprint. Spotty coverage, half the time my apps don't work because of low coverage... dropping calls, etc. Not to mention messing up payments and bills.  Tonight, however, I'm livid. My iphone died and I plugged it into my charger for 30 minutes. No luck. I tried two other chargers and still nothing worked. So I took it in to the store.  Some employee with blondeish hair and black rimmed glasses came up and immediately acted annoyed he even had to help me. I explained my problem and said he could try plugging it in to their charger but "if its anything more than that, youre gonna have to wait" Ummmm ok, rude.  He told me it was working fine and that I could just buy another charger if I wanted. No, I'd rather not waste my money. I got home and its been on the charger making the same screen it made at the store for an hour now, and it's still dead.  Sprint might want to have knowledgible employees when it comes to Apple if they're going to be dealing with iPhones. Guess I'll head over to the Apple Store for help tomorrow. Sprint and their employees are useless.

My boyfriend and I are regulars here and by regulars I mean we come usually twice a week. The service is always amazing (we love Bill and his super sweet wife who bartends.)     We like to sit in the bar so we can see games on the tvs and we have never had to wait.   The food is amazing. Best chips and salsa and guacamole. I always get the shrimp tacos (something about the sauce they give you for the tacos is like crack - so good) and my boyfriend usually gets something different each time and has never been disappointed.   Their margaritas are great (get a pitcher to share) and prices are awesome as well.   We love Julio G's and will keep coming... All the time lol. Definitely recommend!

So glad I found this place in my neighborhood. It's big, clean and super cute inside. Tons of gel colors and decent prices. They take their time and pay attention to detail. Definitely recommend - it's my new go to nail salon.

My favorite neighborhood dive bar! Always a laid back atmosphere, super great prices on drinks, and friendly staff (Rob is awesome) They also have a juke box we always entertain ourselves with. They don't have a big food menu so I wouldn't recommend it if you're hungry.. otherwise this place is awesome.

I was super disappointed with Sushi on Shea. My boyfriend and I split three rolls and he had a beer. I ordered a cocktail (the purple haze I think) and it was NOT good. I asked for a glass of wine instead... we got charged for both of the drinks. Total came to $84... that seemed crazy?! The lady that was working was super friendly and funny... that's the only reason I would give this place two stars and not one.

I brought my dog Reece in today as a walk in to get her nails trimmed. They took us right away and the lady was SO good with her. We were in and out in about 5 minutes and she did a great job! We will be back!

I love this clinic. I've been taking my dog Reece here for the last two years since I've had her. Every single visit I've been pleased. Everyone is super friendly from the staff at the front desk to the vet techs to the doctors themselves.   I brought Reece in today for an exam and we had Dr. Mendolia. She was so patient and kind and gentle with Reece. She answered all my questions thoroughly. We loved her! Although everyone we have seen have been great.  I would recommend this clinic to any and everyone!

Oh. My. Gosh. Where do I even begin?   My boyfriend brought me here last night for a dinner out and our experience by far exceeded our expectations. Our server was Michael and he was amazing. Very knowledgable about the menu, friendly, and quick.   I had a dirty martini that was made perfectly. We started with the rock shrimp and crab dumplings. Delicious. Then I ordered the Filet of Beef, and he ordered the pork chop. They were both out of this world. We took our first bites and looked at each other in amazement lol. The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare. I'm from Nebraska and it was by far the best steak I've ever had. We finished every bite.   Portions are a good size too. I feel like at most upscale restaurants you get small portions, but not here.   We were so full but were afraid to miss out on dessert so we ordered the Smores. It was just as delicious as everything else and we finished every last bite.   The view is amazing from the bottom booth we sat in and we were there right at sunset.   I highly recommend Elements. We have been talking about our dinner all day today, and we can't wait to go back.

I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday last month. He loves seafood and last year I took him to Ocean Club which was outrageously expensive with mediocre food. So I thought I would try something different and took him to SC. Totally pleasantly surprised!  We had two drinks each, he had the stuffed lobster and I had crab legs. Both entrees came with potatoes, veggies and a side salad. They brought out bread and butter before, and for his birthday a free piece of Snickers cheesecake at the end. The food was DELICOUS... and a lot of it. Neither of us could finish it all.  The bill ended up being about $85, and I was shocked, expecting way more. Very happy about that!  The atmosphere is fun, its all underground with a cool little bar. You can dress up if you want, but you could also go totally casual. I like having that option.  I will definitely return and have already been recommending this place to a lot of my clients. 5 stars!

This place is literally a DUMP!!! I stayed here for MAYBE an hour at the most tonight on business before I left. It's a motel and my room was right by the pool. I could hear everything outside and in all the rooms around me. The room was sketchy and creepy and I couldn't get the AC to stay on. To make matters worse, the walls were so paper thin I could hear the people in the next room having sex SO loud and they were banging on the wall. I immediately packed up and left. This was easily the worst hotel experience of my life. DO NOT STAY HERE

No. Just no.   We were informed to come here after TAP at MGM said they were one of the few places showing the McGregor/Diaz and Holm/Tate fight.  Got there and there was a bit of a line that moved quickly. The bouncer told us it would be $60 a person cover but "all you can drink" once you're inside. Two of my friends immediately left because they didn't want to pay that much for cover. My other friend and I wanted to check other places first (Twin peaks & Cabo Wabo). Other places were at least $75 with nothing included so Blondies seemed like a better deal.   We came back, paid the $60 and were shocked when we got inside. (you can't see the inside of the bar on fight night as there as black curtains draped everywhere). It was PACKED. When I say packed I mean they should have a maximum capacity limit which they clearly ignored. Every table was taken, and they had chairs set up in every other open floor area which were also all taken. People were literally eating pizza off of the floor due to lack of seating and tables.   They also didn't tell us that "all you can drink" meant ONLY bud light. My friend doesn't even drink beer (gluten intolerance) so it was a total rip off for her. Bud light is not my drink of choice, I would have rather had a cheap well vodka with soda. This was so deceiving and should have been told to us at the door upon taking our money.   It was just pure chaos. We paid $60 to stand and be pushed by rushed waitresses telling us "excuse me" and "please move" for FOUR HOURS!!!   I would NEVER come back here. Staff is dishonest and only wants your money. I've never been more uncomfortable in a bar in my life. Never again. STAY AWAY!

My FAVORITE place to get my nails done (I drive from North Scottsdale here every two weeks) They are always creative and do great gel. (If you like glitter, ask to see the loose glitter they put on nails... so pretty) The only reason I wouldn't give 5 stars is because it IS just a little pricey.... and I've noticed sometimes inconsistent pricing from person to person so you never really know what you're going to pay. All in all it's worth the drive and price to me.

Annoyed! I usually love Francesca's and love their great customer service but this morning I came by in a hurry on the way to a wedding venue (I'm doing the hair for the wedding) to get a dress and some accessories last minute. I called ahead of time and the voicemail said they opened at 10:00. I got there at 10:05. Nothing. 10:10. No one. I called the contact number twice that was in the window (which too said they open at 10:00) and no one answered. Finally at 10:25 I couldn't wait any longer and went and grabbed a dress from Charming Charlie. Not going to lie, I'm pissed. Francesca's is usually my go to spot and now I will never come back to this one.

This is seriously my favorite breakfast spot all because of the Toluca Brizza (breakfast pizza) It has chorizo and jalepeno cream cheese. Pretty spicy but so good. I can never finish the whole thing, usually end up taking about half of it home.   I love the dog friendly patio. Service is usually quick and efficient. I'm so happy they are opening a Scramble in Scottsdale! We will definitely continue to be regulars.

I've had to take each of my two dogs here once before. I took Reece, after she got a case of kennel cough that had her stopping dead in her tracks on a walk. It scared me so I took her in for an emergency visit. The vet I saw was a female and she was so sweet and gentle with reece as was the rest of the staff. They got her on an antibiotic and got her better in no time.   Today I had to bring in Reggie after he was having a HORRIBLE allergic reaction to something unknown. I was in a panic and when I got there they immediately took him back while I did some paperwork. 5 minutes later I was brought into a room and the male doctor gave him a steroid that immediately helped the swelling go down. He recommended a bath and a 10mg Zyrtec which we did when we got home and now he's almost back to normal.   Everyone here is so kind and understanding. I've never had to wait long. I would give it 5 stars but the emergency visits are super expensive at $100.

Maybe I'm totally a Grinch in the morning... but I almost try to avoid this place because of the forced awkward "friendly" but seemingly phony conversation from the employees. It's just TOO much lol. Coffee is alright... I will probably head to Starbucks over Dutch Bros :(

Let me start off by saying I've never been the person to prebook massages or even get them regularly. But Theresa totally changed that for me! I've been prebooking massages with her every month (sometimes twice) because she's that good! I'm a hairstylist so I'm on my feet all day long and I get pretty bad back and shoulder pain. She applies just the right amount of pressure to sooth my muscles and also relax me at the same time. She is seriously the best.   Prices are very doable and the place immaculate. The front desk is always very friendly   I highly recommend Hand and Stone - ask for Theresa!!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE hulas. Their food is so good. I always get the ahi tacos. Spicy and delicious. The prices are super reasonable. The staff is always so friendly. Great atmosphere.  My favorite part is the dog friendly patio :) I always bring my pup to hang out on the patio (we call it Yappy Hour) and our server always brings out a bowl of water immediately for her!  I would recommend this place to anyone for great food, service and atmosphere.

I don't understand all the bad reviews on Sears Auto Center. I've never had a bad experience.   Today in particular I was impressed and pleased. I stopped in around 4:00 for an oil change. They lifted my car up and saw my alignment was totally out of wack (I had a feeling by the way it was driving).  They showed me the papers and proof and also suggested a coolant flush and brake job. At first I was thinking what everyone was thinking.. Up selling.   They told me they would take the tires off and do the brake inspection for free (usually $15) and ended up coming back saying they were fine and I didn't need them done. I really appreciated the honesty!   All in all they did the brake inspection for free and also the tire rotation for free. They discounted the coolant flush and alignment and did it all for WAY under what I expected. Everyone was super friendly and helpful.   I would give them 5 stars but they seemed a little understaffed and slow. The waiting area was really dirty which I spent a couple hours in. But if you have a long wait they are right across the street from PV mall, you can walk to shop or see a movie!   All in all Sears Auto Center will continue to get my business and I would recommend them to any of my friends or family.

Came here yesterday for brunch with my friend and was not impressed. We both did the bottomless mimosas and had to wait way too long for refills. Not fun considering you don't get the fair share of "bottomless." We were hungry so I ordered the Monte Cristo and she ordered a burger. It took literally an hour for it to come out. We kept asking where our food was and our waitress had to keep asking. And when it finally did, I had a hair on my plate! Disgusting.   I'm only giving two stars because our waitress was nice and felt bad about the hour long wait on our food that she didn't charge us for it.   I'll stick to Hulas for brunch and mimosas from now on.

I'm so annoyed. After my friend and I drove around 3 different places trying to find a place to do our two pedicures, we finally come here and they say they can do both of us.   They start my friend and I'm sitting there waiting. There are two other women doing pedis across from me. One is finishing up so I assume she will start mine. Wrong. A girl walked in AFTER me for a nail repair and she took care of her while I'm still sitting here.   My friends guy was already PAINTING her toes when the second lady said she would start mine. I'm over it by now. I don't want to sit and wait and watch my friend get a pedi and then have her sit and wait while I get mine. If you can't do both at the same time then tell us. I opted out of even getting one and I'm leaving with a much needed pedicure. I will never be back here.

Not too impressed with this location. I went this morning to order an iced "Vanilla Chai" and the girl said it only comes hot but that she could pour it over ice although it may be watered down.. Umm no thanks.   I then asked if they had almond or soy milk. No and no. She said "Not at this location." For being pretty popular for coffee that seemed odd to me.   Lastly I ordered one of their Wake up Wraps with egg white and turkey. When I got to the window she handed me a bag and I looked inside and it was literally the size of a single small street taco. Definitely looks nothing like the picture and not worth it.   I'm giving two stars because the drive thru line went quickly.. However I probably will not be back and stick to Starbucks or Dutch for my coffee/breakfast.

Literally the best brunch on the strip. Came around 1:00 pm Saturday starving from being out the night before. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive and informative. I got the crab cakes Benedict with a side of bacon. Two of my friends ordered the short rib Benedict and my other friend the smoked salmon plate. Everything was SO good. Our waiter was quick to refill our water and coffee. I had a mimosa and asked for one to go (it is Vegas after all) and he gave me the biggest mimosa of my life in a to go cup (score!) We were pleasantly surprised at the price too, seriously not bad for being on the strip.   All around aesthetically pleasing inside (I mean, it is the Cosmo) and comfy seating. I will DEFINITELY be back here next time I'm in Vegas!   (By the way, is this the same Henry that they have in Phoenix near the Biltmore?)

So good. Everything about it from the decor and ambiance to the food and drinks. Definitely recommend for brunch. My friends and I shared the "Avocado Love" to start and had mango mimosas. Delicious. I had the red velvet pancakes and my friend had the French toast. Everything was so good and the service was excellent. I can't wait to come back.

This is the BEST place for sushi in the area. My boyfriend and I are weekly regulars. You seriously cannot beat their all day happy hour prices and the sushi is so good. Try the Phoenix Roll and the Magic Roll (two of my personal favs).  They also deliver if you live nearby, but its a lot more expensive because you wont get the happy hour price.  The staff is always super friendly and the restaurant is very clean. 5 stars from me!

This is probably the worst Chipotle I've ever been to. I Understand that they get busy but I've been to many locations with long lines that move quickly. This location however, is the SLOWEST one in the world.   The line is always to the door and you can expect to wait 15-20 minutes before paying. Most of the workers are soooo slow. Each time I've been in they are always low on meat or guacamole and you have to stand there and wait minutes for it to be replaced.   Also the parking is horrible. The "lot" is super tiny. Tonight there was no parking available and I had to park across the street at the mall and walk over.   All in all I'm done coming here. I'd rather drive to 7th and Bell for good service and parking.

Super rude bouncers and staff outside the club. We were on a guest list with a table inside and they treated my friend and I like we were a piece of crap until we finally got in. No like seriously, the bouncers are super douche bags. Inside, good hip hop music which is a nice change from house music all over the strip. Super small night club compared to the other ones nearby. I would come back here it just sucks you have to deal with insanely rude staff. We had to ask our bottle service girl multiple times for drinks, she was not attentive at all. Then she just disappeared at some point. Oh well.

I can't believe I am even reviewing a McDonalds but it had to be done.   I just went in for an iced nonfat coffee. When I got to the 2nd window the guy handed me the coffee hot. I corrected him politely and said that I ordered it iced. He rolled his eyes and took the coffee back. Next thing I know he hands me an iced cup... With the SAME HOT COFFEE IN IT with melted ice floating around.   Was it really SO MUCH WORK to remake me an iced coffee how I ordered it the right way? When I asked if he had just put ice in the same hot coffee he said "Well it comes out hot anyway." That's a complete lie. He was just too lazy and rude to remake it.   By the time I got home (3 mins away) it was melted, watered down and lukewarm. I called the location and spoke to the "manager" (some lady with broken English) and she kept interrupting me and just telling me to come back and get it the right way.   No thanks, no sense in driving back there and giving them any more business. I will never return here again. That guy should be fired. Horrible customer service!! Stay away!!!

I would probably only give this place two stars. I came for breakfast with my boyfriend today and neither of us were too impressed.   We started with the flight of bacon. First of all for what you get it's expensive. $8-$9. They all tasted the same except for the peppered bacon somewhat stood out.   I ordered the Arizona omelette because I love chorizo. You literally couldn't even taste or see the chorizo. It seemed like one big blended omelette. Kind of weird. Plus it's SMOTHERED in "ranchero" sauce. It's this dark red thick spicy sauce. I would ask for it on the side if you're going to order it.   My boyfriend got the breakfast burger. He didn't seem too thrilled.   To be honest, I know it's the "oink cafe" but it was almost pork overload. And I don't really enjoy staring at pictures of cute cartoon pigs all over the walls while I eat bacon. Probably won't be returning.

Do not go to this "urgent care."  I've been twice and both times they tell me they will not give me antibiotics because they say it's "viral and needs to run it's course."   After the first time at fastmed, I ended up at a normal doctor who gave me a Z-pak for a full blown sinus infection that fastmed said was viral and wouldn't treat. What do you know the Z-pak worked!  This last time I went because I along with 2 other people got a bug in Costa Rica and we were all violently ill. My two friends got antibiotics from doctors and are already better... The "doctor" who saw me at fastmed told me it wasn't a bug from CR but a viral infection I got here. Ummm yeah right. She refused to give me antibiotics and I'm now sicker than before. I'm so mad. $60 copay for an over the counter "prescription" aka anti nausea pills. Stay away from this place!!!

I love this HOJO. It's in an excellent location in oldtown Scottsdale. A close walk to restaurants and bars and coffee. The location is quiet and very clean. Everything is very basic but I have felt so comfortable here. The staff are all very helpful and friendly. Rates are great too.   I travel to Scottsdale for a week every 6 weeks to do hair at the salon next door. I'm hoping to stay here from now on for my travel as I have been very pleased staying here this weekend. They even have MATRIX hair and body products. Nice job Hojo!

I love Dr Heffner! A friend of mine recommended her to me for Botox and now I will never go anywhere else. She is super friendly and easy to talk to, and her work is thorough yet quick! Results are always amazing. I'm so glad I found her. I'm a hairstylist and am now referring all of my clients to Dr Heffner for Botox. The office is immaculate and the rest of the staff always very friendly. I would highly recommend Skin Savvy to anyone! You won't be disappointed. Be sure to ask about signing up for the Brilliant Distinctions rewards program!

I got a spray tan last night from Jackie and I'm going to be hooked! She was so super sweet and made me feel very comfortable. She was very knowledgable and walked me thru everything she was doing. I got the rapid tan and when I left I looked super dark (I kind of liked it lol) but was told to rinse off 4 hours later and this morning my tan looks amazing! It's not at all orange, just a very dark sun kissed look. I am so happy I came here. Now I have a great tan for San Diego this weekend. Thank you Jackie and Arizona Airbrush Studio! Highly recommend.

Woofs Wiggles n Wags has gone thru some rough patches with some pretty bad staff in the past. I've been following them pretty closely over the last couple months and I can say I've seen MAJOR improvement. New volunteers are making a new beginning for this place. Cleaning constantly being done, lots of dog walkers, medical issues being addressed, and adoption events being held every weekend.   Always remember. As animal lovers, we do it for the animals. Not for the people. Instead of bashing and hating, why not step in and help when it's seen to be needed?   Very proud of WWW for the big time turn around. They've got some great dogs there that need forever homes. Stop in any time and check them out!

I love Blooming. Everytime I end up at a different place for a pedicure I wish I would have come here. Lesson learned.   I always get the deluxe pedicure for $33. It comes with a sugar scrub, callus remover, hot stone and hot towel. They give the best massages and they seem longer than most places too!   They always polish flawlessly. They have a big selection of regular polish and also gel.   Today I got a deluxe pedicure and a fill with gel polish. The girl that did them did amazing. (Picture shown)  No more guessing and trying new places - I will be a regular here from now on!

First off let me start on a positive note... this nail place is SUPER cute and modern inside. They have TONS of color choices (both regular polish and gel including rockstar glitter) and you also get offered complimentary water, soda, wine or champagne. The staff and lady at the front desk (Stephanie I think) are all super friendly.  Now the not so good... I got here around 3PM and started with the basic pedicure, which was just that. Pretty basic. It was short and to the point, but when I left I noticed polish on the skin of my toes outside the nail. Kind of annoying but whatever.  I asked the girl doing my pedi (who was also supposed to do my gel mani) if she would build out my nails a little longer using gel and NOT acrylic (a friend of mine had told me about this technique) and she seemed confused so she asked one of the other guys how to do it. If she couldn't do it I would have been fine with that and would have appreciated the honesty...  She started my manicure and trimmed my cuticles then put the tips on my nails. I was then left sitting there and waiting for probably 20 minutes on the other guy to finish his client. He then moved me across the room to his station.  He used this clear gel that came out of a pot over the tips and put the rockstar glitter I picked on. The glitter seemed sparse with some uncovered spots so I asked if he could do a little more. He then grabbed a totally different color (a white) and sprinkled that on my nails which totally changed the look of the color. He put two more coats of this clear gel on top and they were feeling totally bumpy and uneven. I asked him to make them shorter (which he didn't.. he barely filed them) and then to smooth the top... which he did. But used a drill that totally took the sparkle away and left them dull. I then asked for ANOTHER coat of clear gel to make them sparkly again.   He explained to me after all of this, that the product he used is just like acrylic powder but in gel form, and that the maintenance required a fill... which I asked about in the beginning and wasn't informed on.  When we finally finished everything it was 5:30. Two and a half hours for a mani and what I thought was going to be a pretty basic gel manicure seems crazy to me.   It's also pretty expensive. Ended up costing $82... with tip I spent $100... Definitely can't do that every other week. I think I will have to end up back at Scottsdale Nails or Pink Polish :(

This place is amazing. I'm a little embarrassed to say I've been 3 times in the last week. The first time my friend and I split the Llano Pablano burger and baby kale salad. AMAZING!   The second time another friend and I split the Greek lamb burger. It wasn't my favorite. But still pretty tasty.   Last night I went with my boyfriend and I got the seared ahi burger. It was so good I literally woke up thinking about it this morning ha.   Make sure you also get or split the Parmesan truffle fries. To. Die. For.   Moscow mules are awesome. Friendly staff (Love Milan) and fairly quick. I will definitely be returning again and probably again!

This place is so good! I'm usually not a big pizza person but I thought I would give the new neighborhood food stop a chance.   I got the Pesto My Chicken pizza on wheat dough and it was amazing. The crust isn't too thin and isn't too thick. My boyfriend got the Hawaiian pizza and it was really good too.   The pizzas only take two minutes to cook. Seems like as soon as we sat down on the patio our pizzas were out. The patio is also dog friendly!  They are the perfect size. I would say most guys could probably eat one alone and girls could split :)   Definitely will be regulars here!

I've been doing personal group training with Katie for a couple of months now and I love her!! I actually look forward to working out with her every Wednesday night. Her and her husband Aaron are both super nice and very knowledgable about fitness and nutrition. They are also Herbalife distributors so you can always stop in for a delicious protein shake. They do free workout classes almost every day of the week. I would definitely recommend Knockout Nutrition to anyone. Ask for Katie!

Came here with my boyfriend last night (first time at the new location.) It was dead. They had live music which was pretty good but kind of loud. Our waitress was attentive and nice.   However... I got the regular Salty margarita and it was probably the worst marg I've ever had. It was SO sweet I was literally struggling to finish it. I love margaritas usually, but this was just bad bad bad. Nothing on the menu looked that great so we just stuck with chips and salsa (average salsa).   Probably won't be returning. You can get a better margarita down the street at Loco Patron or Z Tejas.

I've been here quite a few times. Honestly my favorite thing to do here in have some mimosas in the morning on the weekends. I feel like food is so hit or miss... And usually it's a miss.   I've had a couple of their panini's and they have all been super dry. Like its missing some sauce or something.   The hummus and veggie appetizer is total waste of money. $10 for the TINIEST blob of hummus and way too many veggies.  I had the chicken and strawberry salad a few weeks ago and it was delicious. I've seriously been craving it since. I went back today with my brother and it wasn't even the same!! It had NO goat cheese (my favorite part), the tiniest smallest morsels of chicken, and like 4 strawberry slivers. Look if I'm paying $11 for a freaking salad at least be consistent with it and don't chince out on the good ingredients.   To make it worse my brother went in and asked for some goat cheese to put on it since it was left off, and they literally gave me a glob of it in a bowl. Wasn't even crumbled so I could put it on the salad.   You wait forever for your food and appetizers usually NEVER come out before the entree.   I won't be returning any longer. This place looks way better than any experience you will have here. Bland, inconsistent, overpriced food.

Came here with a couple of friends yesterday because one of them wanted to get her nose pierced. She was super nervous and we were always told before you HAD to get it pierced with a stud and then could change it to a hoop after healing. Ryan was the piercer there that day and he was so nice and helpful and informative. He told her he could pierce it with a hoop, which he did amazingly. I think she paid around $155 total which seemed a little pricy. Then I decided I wanted to get my hoop changed. I got my nose pierced initially in Seattle and had a horrible experience. I had been told a few times that it was pierced too high up to have a small hoop. Finally I found a place in Omaha that would do a hoop but it was thick and silver and I never loved it. Ryan showed me a thinner gold hoop that he could put in which is exactly what I had been wanting so I was really happy. However, it was $80 for him to change my jewelry! I know it was gold and more expensive but that seemed high again. On the way out I was inquiring about an industrial piercing. The piece of jewelry he showed me was $375!!!! I was shocked. Don't get me wrong, this place is beautiful and totally immaculate. Ryan was AWESOME I would recommend him to anyone. I would have given 5 stars if pricing was a little more reasonable however I would come back because they do quality work.

Meh. Just ok. Boyfriend and I got a groupon so we tried this place today.   I ordered the jalapeño cilantro margarita and it tasted like a house margarita. I asked if they could make it a little bit spicier and when I tried that one I swear it burned my throat on the way down. One extreme to the other.   I ordered the Mexican pizza. It was essentially a cheese crisp with tomatoes and I added grilled chicken. No lettuce or anything else on it. I thought it was odd.   My boyfriend ordered the enchilada stack and it was tiny. They forgot to bring out the black beans he ordered.   We did order the sopapillas and those were amazing served with vanilla bean ice cream.   I told our waitress when we first arrived about us having the groupon. She said she would take it off the bill at the end. When the bill arrived the groupon discount had not been taken off, and I was double charged for my chicken on the Mexican pizza. It was corrected but took double the time.    We both agreed we would not return and frankly I'm glad we had $25 off from groupon because the food and service was NOT worth $50.

Came here for Calvin Harris last Friday. My group of girl friends and I had been in touch with a couple of promotors for guest list and were told multiple times there would be no guest list since he was headlining that night. So, we all went online and bought tickets $30 each for females.   We were then told on the strip by promotors Friday during the day there WOULD be a guest list, so we were added and told to be there by 10pm. (Waist of money for the tickets, they never even asked for them upon arrival)  When we got there at 10 the line was growing but it moved quickly. We were probably inside the club in 10 mins. They immediately corralled us to the new outside terrace which had a GORGEOUS view of the strip. It was packed though. I mean hard to move, and it was only 10pm. Drinks were about $25 a pop which is expected.  We made our way inside and were blown away by the visual aesthetics of the club as a whole. It's HUGE and has two levels. The lights were amazing. Tables all around the top and bottom levels with a medium size dance floor.   Here's my complaint. I would NEVER come here again unless you have a table reservation. They pack you in so tight you can barely move. I had multiple drinks spilled all over me and we never even were on the dance floor.   At one point, a group of older Indian guys invited us into their table which was right behind the DJ booth. We thought cool, so we sat down. Keep in mind we had our OWN drinks we had just bought and weren't even touching their alcohol. They were so ridiculously drunk. One guy was trying to dry hump my friend, and another guy who was sitting next to my other friend literally grabbed her boobs. We were so mad. Right as that happened, security came up to us and told us that THEY didn't want us at the table anymore. Seriously?! We were pissed. We felt like they turned their heads while these guys were being drunk inappropriate assholes and then kicked us out.   We had been waiting ALL night for Calvin or we would have left right then and there. He finally came on around 1:45 am. We were packed against a wall. A bottle service girl stepped on my open toe with her stiletto.   It was just too much. We didn't even stay for his entire set. I would NEVER come back here again without a table. It's just not worth it and you're treated like crap.

I can't say enough good things about Bonefish. My boyfriend and I come here at least once a week. The food is always amazing and the service is great. We've had Robert as our waiter a couple of times and he's awesome. He has very thorough knowledge of the menu as well as the cocktails. I totally trust his opinion.   The bang bang shrimp appetizer is SO good. I swear I crave it during the week. We've also had the flatbread appetizer that was equally as great.   I love the seared ahi tuna bowl. It has jasmine rice and avocado. The ocean trust tropic martini is my favorite. It's light and refreshing and fruity with just the right amount of heat from the jalapeño. The bartenders also make a great dirty martini with studded bleu cheese olives.   Our FAVORITE at Bonefish though is the weekend brunch. $20 for whatever brunch entree you want with BOTTOMLESS bubbles (mimosas, bellinis or blackberry sangria). I've had the Oscar omelette which was great but our favorite is the eggs Benedict. You can't go wrong with the surf and turf Benedict or the bang bang shrimp Benedict.   The manager is always walking around and is courteous enough to check on everyone through out the day. She's super sweet.   So excited Bonefish moved in to where islands used to be. Definitely check it out for weekend brunch!!

I am a HUGE OHSO fan so words literally couldn't explain my excitement when I found out one was opening less than a mile from my house.   The new location is gorgeous. The outside area reminds me of a smaller version of "The Yard" - corn hole and lots of other games. Cute little dog area with faux grass for the dogs to play on. Awesome fountain with water coming out of beer taps. The orange lanterns hanging everywhere are so pretty at night.   Food and drinks were amazing as usual. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. I am so bummed out they got rid of the flatbreads on the menu. I literally crave it and would order every single time. I hope they atleast keep the brunch flatbread *fingers crossed*   Love the ambiance and everything about this place. Whenever I say "OHSO" my dog runs around in circles. So happy we will be able to walk to one now! Jon Lane you are awesome! The best one yet. Thank you!

Love this new location. Hardly ever a line and if there is, it moves quickly. They get my order right every time.

Came here last night (3/26). Rude rude rude bouncers outside. My friends were already there and came out to meet me and they wouldn't let me in because they were "at capacity." In the mean time they were letting groups of guys in. Finally 20 minutes later I got in. Apparently one of my friends asked the DJ about a song and he didn't say a word just rudely pointed to a sign that says no requests. Then, coming back from the bathroom, it was so crowded my friend and I stopped near (not IN) the opening to the bar, and the bouncer with the long goatee literally pushed me and yelled at me to not stand there.   I will never come back here. The bartenders were a little nicer but overall the staff were rude and totally ruined the experience. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.

I love the remodel, and I used to be a HUGE Dos Gringos fan. I haven't been here on a weekend night but I came here with a couple of friends yesterday for drinks and appetizers. Drinks were good and our bartender was friendly. I ordered a second drink and at one point the other male bartender brought me a cup with lemons because he "heard I liked lemons"  Chips and guacamole were delicious. The new decor is really nice and the bathrooms were SUPER nice. Especially compared to what they used to look like. I will totally come back here.
