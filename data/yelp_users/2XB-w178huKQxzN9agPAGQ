My friend was craving Mexican food and decided to order for pick up from Cafe Rio.  I really liked how easy it was to order on their website they had pictures of all their entrees which was super helpful in deciding.    I went with their spicy steak burrito with black beans and no rice. I also requested for the spicy sauce on top of the burrito. When we picked up our order, our food was nicely packed up and ready to go.   My burrito was gigantic, and it was covered in sauce just how I wanted it. The spicy sauce wasn't that spicy unfortunately and it really didn't have any flavor. I liked the flour tortilla it was nice and chewy and soft and the black beans were just ok. But I was really disappointed with the steak meat. The steak meat did not taste like anything, they were  generous with the portions and size of the meat which was nice, but it was just very flavorless. The meat was also drowned in more of the flavorless spicy sauce which made it really difficult to actually taste the meat. I managed to eat half of the burrito because I was hungry but I guess for next time I don't think this place will be on the top of my list.

Speechless! We now have a reason to come to Vegas! This is a small hole in the wall place in a small shopping plaza. We were kind of skeptical at first just because of the restaurant itself but we were very much surprised when the food came out. The bulgogi meat tacos were made to perfection, all the ingredients tasted amazing. It was something I had never experienced before.... I was in taco heaven! We were kind of disappointed because we were not able to try their pork tacos, they apparently were waiting for their shipment.  But next time we are in town we are definetly returning to KOMEX!
