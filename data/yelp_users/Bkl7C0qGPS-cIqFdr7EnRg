Had an amazing experience from start to finish! Went yesterday for Mother's Day dinner with my two kids and fiancée. Of course it's a Sunday holiday so there was a wait. We were told 15-20 minutes and were sat in 5. My only complaint is that it is obvious that if you have kids under 5, you are ONLY sat in the back by the bathrooms. Seriously there were 4 booths in a row with high chairs and none in the rest of the restaurant. Come on now, just because I have kids doesn't mean I want to smell the restrooms while trying to eat. Gross!     Anyways, our server was awesome and took excellent care of us! She checked on us often and was a total sweetheart! I can't remember her name but next time I go there I will definitely look for her to be our server again!     The food was delicious and came out fast even though the restaurant was busy. I wasn't a fan of the calamari because there is more broccoli and peppers than actual calamari. The crab cakes were awesome! Even my kids are them! I got the snow crab legs and they were good and my fiancée got a salmon/lobster tail/ shrimp plate that he really enjoyed! Overall, great food.   I've been to this location before but this was by far the best trip here and a lot of it had to do with our server! :-) I just hope management sees this and changes the whole "all kids go to the back" mentality. I'll make sure next time to ask to sit as far from the restrooms as possible!

Been going here for 10 years and no matter where around the west valley I move, I will always make sure to go here for my nails and brows!

Large portions and average prices for any Chinese restaurant. Fast delivery but the food isn't that great. Shrimp Lo Mein had no flavor except for the shrimp which tasted like it came from a muddy pond or something. I also ordered the orange chicken which only came with minimal sauce on it. Some pieces didn't even have sauce on them. And the beef and Broccoli was super salty. Hopefully I just ordered on a bad day because this used to be my favorite place in the area

Came in and ordered A couple Vegas rolls Togo on a Friday. It was slow so The food came out quickly and the hostess was super friendly. When I go to work (which is 3miles away) I opened my Togo box and was immediately bummed. The rolls were super sloppy looking (like they just threw everything on there quickly) and were small. Nothing special and they were mediocre in taste. I was still hungry after I ate. Not satisfied at all especially for $25! I used to love this place and know it used to be better. I am sad to say that I won't be back.

Stay away! The guys who did my nails was super snotty when I asked for a pink and white powder full set with a design on 2 nails. I showed him a picture (Simple American flag) and asked if he could please do it like the picture. He then asked "well what colors do you want the flag?" .... Really? I explained and he didn't say a word after that. He cut my fingers 2 times and burned one nail with the electric file from it going to fast. My nails look like a beauty school drop out did them! Uneven and have white acrylic spots on the pink nail beds. When he asked how I liked them after I washed my hands I told him that there were still white spots. He said "the white goes away after top coat is on" I rolled my eyes and said "ok" and what do ya know? White spots are still there! He had the audacity to say "they look good" after I commented there were still spots. He never did the designs on the two fingers either... Worst experience ever. I even went to another shop after I left to get my eyebrows done!

Totally impressed! We aren't big on fast food in my family but we decided to try Freddy's burgers anyway since I didn't feel like cooking. I was pleasantly surprised that their food wasn't covered in grease and it tasted good too! Next time we will try the frozen treats! :-)
