I hate the new concept of verizon wireless, it's a high pressure commission based environment.   Once they have your money and you under contract they could care less about helping you with anything.  Tech Supprt at 611 is worthless for any real problems and they send you to a store to sell you stuff you don't need.  Verizon sucks but they are all pretty much the same.

Wow location stinks.   The kid they have working there has no personality and a bad attitude.   He wasn't friendly and would barely an annunciate to answer a question.  Not to mention my vegetable were undercooked and cold and the chicken was cold.

I'm done with Jimmy Johns.   A year ago their delivery driver stole my phone when I went to get the people who ordered food at the office, now this store doesn't know that I can sub pickle for chips and over charged me.  Not to mention it took about 3 minutes for the untrained kid to ring me up.  Jimmy johns service sucks.

Two burgers and two drinks will set you back 26$. To much mula for an ok burger.   A large drink sets you back 3$.

This is quite possibly the worst Chinese food I have ever ate.  The vegetable taste old. The soup tastes old.   Short changed at register.  I won't be coming back.

Maybe the Brioche isn't a true Brioche, but the mac & cheese burger that I had was awesome. The service was friendly and very good. They gave me some of their special dipping sauce for my burger or fries without me even asking for it.  The girl that helped me came out and packed up the condiments that I had taken out while waiting for my order and put them in the bag.  They have real brewed China mist Iced tea.  The place was clean during lunch time.  For me the burger was great, the service was great, they get five stars.
