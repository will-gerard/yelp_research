A friend recommended I try Steven Paul Salon, as its close to where I live. Its hard to find stylists that get my curly hair and style it well as well as a person who chooses just the right color. At least that has been my experience. I went to see Brittany Rudd in the salon. Brittany chose an amazing red tone color for my hair as well as she did a very cute cut. We chatted the whole time being there and she truly cares and listens. Brittany, thanks and I will be back :)

Yes, do not bother calling as you never get through and my 1 star is generous one, as I would give 0 if I could! This is the main post office for our Arcadia area. The person that delivers mail to us, is never consistent. Especially when I am expecting an important package or check in the mail....mail either does not get delivered or it is delivered very late in the day! Especially before a long weekend. Ridiculous!!! When you try calling, they never answer the phone.  USPS you guys need to put some reliable people into these jobs!

My dad was visiting from eastern Europe for 5 months and he needed a haircut. Our friend recommended 48th street Barber Shop. Very happy with the visit. They are great, very professional and dad was very happy with his haircut.

Jeph and Amanda are truly an amazing team. I agree with the girls that posted great reviews, as that is exactly what I have experienced!  Professional, fun and Jeph is a true artist! If you are looking for just a vanilla photography - this isn't it! Keep looking.   There are so many out there producing average results....but I wasn't looking for average! I wanted creative and artsy... I had a very unpleasant experience with another photographer before I came to DeLorme Studios and I shared it with them, as I was very nervous doing another shoot.  He met with me for a short consult, showed me his work and I was very excited about scheduling my session. I knew he gets me and he gets what I am trying to create and the way I want to use the pictures.  Amanda was very sweet. Confirmed the appointment with all the details and we had a great chat before and after my session as well.  The shoot itself was so much fun. I enjoyed it very much and the whole 90 min zipped by before I knew it.  Right after I got home, I received a thank you email from Amanda and the next day the teaser photos from Jeph. All I can say is WOW. They turned out amazing!  Not only would I highly recommend DeLorme Studios, but I will be back myself with my 10 year old getting her own shoot next month.   This truly was my best photography experience ever!

This truly was my best photography experience ever!    2nd review (as we went back for our family photoshoot and my daughters photo's): Again, I would have never gone back if I was not satisfied. My daughter (10) loved Jeph and had ton of fun shooting her pictures. My husband's business photos also turned out great.  We are truly happy with Jeph's work and we could not recommend DeLorme Studios enough.
