after seeing a recent review about this Safeway it reminded me of the last time I shopped there and it made me never want to go back.   As I reached the check out line I hear the cashier say out loud "oh not another customer. C'mon there are other lanes open. How come people keep coming into my lane?"  Now you could make the assumption that he was joking, but I know he wasn't as because a minute later someone got behind me and he again started complaining.  I just couldn't believe this guy was complaining about having to do his job in front of customers and co-workers. It was really rude and unprofessional. Look pal, I don't like to go to work sometimes either but I don't sit and bitch about how I don't want to be there.   Another thing, the Starbucks thing is ridiculous. There is already one in the same complex and then they put one inside the grocery store. Did we really need another one?

my husband and I were driving by this place the other day and not knowing anything about it decided we would give it a try.  I was pleased with the food. I got a bit of food envy when my husband's dish was way yummier than what I ordered.  I got the tacos with beef and potatoes combination. I forget the exact name of the dish my husband ordered, but it was sort of a shrimp burrito dish. It had plenty of shrimp in it and was very tasty. My tacos were good, but I was disappointed at the amount of potatoes in it. I was hoping for a layer of potatoes and a layer of beef, but what they do is mix bits of potato with the beef. It was still good.   Their chips and salsa are decent. The salsa for me gets a bit too spicy after a while.   I would definitley go again if I'm in the neighborhood.

The Blue Fin is a great little place and it truly needs our love. Due to the light rail biz for them has dropped a bit.  I've never been disappointed with anything I have ordered. The gyoza is great, the beef curry and chicken curry bowls are huge, filling and delicious.  I'm always looking for good ice tea and Blue Fin has it.   The owners and staff are always friendly and very accomodating.   This place is small and around lunch time can be packed. They do have a drive thru and if you call ahead all you have to do is pull up to the window and your food is waiting. The drive thru window as far as I know is only for call in orders you can't just pull up and order food.  My only complaint is they are not open on weekends.

I've only been here a few times to sit and grab a beer. I really enjoy the atmosphere of the place and the outside area is great when the weather is nice.  Each time I've been here it was a Friday night and the place is pretty much dead, which is too bad because this is a great spot to sit and hang with friends.   I can't comment on the food as I haven't eaten here. The alcohol selection is a bit sparse, but the bottled beer they have is good.   I'm not big on crowds and I like to be comfortable when I go out, so for me the Paisly Violin is a perfect place to meet up with friends and grab some drinks.

So the past week I've been ordering lunch here nearly everyday. I just love the food.  Everytime I've gone here the food is spot on. A few of my fave sandwiches are The Royal, which is a roast beef sandwich with melted mozzarella, celery, lettuce with aioli sauce served on a yummy baguette. The Champs d'Elysee is also yummy. The sandwich has red peppers, artichokes and spinach. It's a bit creamy with the cream brie and aioli sauce, but tasty.   They usually have a different home made soup everyday and most of the soups I have tried are always very good.  I'm a fan of the Paisley and I hope more people discover this place. Anytime I'm in there, the place is sparse on people and I don't understand why.

I've lived in the valley all of my life and have driven past Phoenix House of Pizza and Subs many, many times and always thought it must be some dingy, nasty place where crackheads hang and they serve greasy pizza. How wrong I was. Of course it's nestled in a dirty liitle strip mall off of Van Buren and I still look around to make sure there are no weirdos lurking about, but this place is worth checking out. My husband works nearby and had gone to this place on his lunch break once and said how great it was and I must try it.  My first visit I ordered two slices of pepperoni. It was very good and filling.  Second trip I ordered a pizza with gyro meat. It was pretty tasty.  They also serve home made baklava, which I haven't tried, but it looks very yummy.  This place is great for eatin' cheap and a tasty slice of pizza.

Since moving from the Ahwautkee area I don't live as close to the salon I used to go to or the gal that cut my hair. I debated making the drive out there for a hair cut and staying loyal to my stylist, but I'm lazy, so I needed a place closer to Central Phoenix. On a tip Ide Mania was recommended (thanks Thomas S.!!). I was prepared that I would be paying $55-$65 for a hair cut which seems insane, but this cut was worth it!  Stephen was my stylist and he is simply awesome! From now on I only want him to cut my hair. Not only did he do an amazing job, but he is from Manchester and I finally got to talk to someone about all the great music from that area of England.   This salon has a nice, laid back atmosphere. The gal (Gina) that works the desk is so friendly and makes you feel very welcome.   I love Aveda products and I'm glad this salon offers their line.   I'm now saving money towards my next hair cut at Ide Mania. It's pricey, but this was the first time I walked out of a salon and have been totally happy with my hair. Big thank you to Stephen for being so awesome!!

Now that I'm living back in Central PHX I got a membership once again at Movies On Central.   I love their selection and I can usually find that odd arty flick here that most other video stores don't carry. Just like this weekend I was searching for "Ladies and Gentleman Introducing The Fabulous Stains" starring a teenage Diane Lane and Movies on Central had it!   I like how they have a cult movie section and section off movies by director.  If you are a movie buff this store is for you.

what? closed?!! how disappointing. I was just here like three weeks ago.  I have been eating here for years. You could always get a very filling  breakfast that was pretty inexpensive.   Katz's Deli you will be missed.

I have been ordering the #7 (chili dog) with fries and an ice tea for nearly 15 years from The Great Dane.   I love this place! The owners are so great and friendly.  The food is simple, but I love it.   This is a small establishment and at times can be kind of crowded and other times there isn't but one customer.

My husband and I ate breakfast here last Sunday and were not disappointed. The place wasn't too busy so it was easy to walk in and grab a table.   I ordered the hash mash which is corned beef, scrambled eggs, potatoes and cheese in a skillet. It was very filling and delicious. However they did put way too much cheese on top and after a while it become too much. I would order the hash mash again, minus the cheese.  My husband ordered pancakes with a side of bacon. The pancakes were big and fluffy and the bacon was thick and tasty, not fatty and floppy.  I looked at the other items on the menu and everything else sounds great. Lots of deli sandwiches, soups and their desserts look very yummy. I plan to check them out for lunch or dinner sometime as well as coming back for breakfast.

The Swizzle Inn is my new dive bar hang out.   After years of driving by this place and being curious about it my husband and a couple of friends checked it out this past Saturday and  downed a few pitchers.  Upon entering we were greeted by the friendly bartendar and I could tell this is the type of bar I would feel very comfortable hanging at.  They have a full bar, but kind of limited on the beers on tap. I believe they only have Bud and Fat Tire. They do have various bottled beers and hard liquor.  Everyone in the bar seemed real friendly, only one douche bag was seen and thankfully he left within an hour (oh, I kid, I kid).  This place has the nicest bathroom of any bar. I was pleasantly surprised how clean and nice the bathroom was. This is one public restroom I'm not afraid to use.   The jukebox isn't too bad. There is something for everyone, especially that person that requested a boat load of Donna Summer and B-52's songs the night I was there.   I will definitley be back for the friendly service, good booze, clean bathroom and laid back atmosphere.

I've been to each of the three locations of Havana Cafe and have never been disappointed. The food is always delicious and I had the best mojitos I've ever had at Havana Cafe.  It can be a bit pricey, but the food is definitely worth it.

this is a decent little Mexican joint with a dash of American. Good burritos, chicken and fajitas. The free chip and salsa bar is nice and they have plenty of booze to choose from.  I enjoy coming here on the weekends for breakfast as there is hardly anyone there and you can get a nice, filling burrito. This location inparticular has it's regulars and the people that work here are always friendly and accomodating.  I always feel comfortable eating here.

I have to agree with you Sarah. I question why I still go here even after everytime I leave my car is scratched up. Sure it's cleaner than when I brought it in, but not as clean as it should be.  I'm too lazy to wash my own car too.

delicious bagels and cream cheese. this place always hits the spot. it does get crowded during certain hours, mostly on weekends. They have the best bagles and cream cheese. Around Halloween/Thanksgiving they have pumpkin bagels and pumpkin cream cheese and they are yummy! I also enjoy their veggie sandwich and roast beef sandwich.

great place! the food is always good and the staff are so friendly and welcoming. They have great, refreshing iced tea. It's just your basic tea, but it's always good.  Pretty much any dish you order will be good. A lot of their dishes are loaded with bits of garlic.  They have great lunch specials and their prices are very reasonable.

my husband and I started going to Keegan's on Sunday's for their brunch, which is pretty decent. If you get there after 10am, the bar is open, which is a plus in my book.  We've eaten lunch and dinner there a few times as well. They have a really good french onion soup, another soup I think was chicken pepper jack and the cobb sandwich is good. Their chicken fried steak is pretty good as well. They give you two decent sized steaks covered in mashed potatoes and gravy. The bar is good as they have a great selection of beers.  I also love their ice tea, it always hits the spot.

I take all of my cats here. I've never had a problem with the staff. Everyone has always been really friendly and helpful and they make your pet feel safe and at ease. Anytime my husband and I take our cat Oliver in there he is in such a panic, but after a few minutes he is cuddling up to the vet techs and the vet.

The hubby and I used to live here. The apartments are decent, the complex always seemed well maintained and maintenance responded to repairs in a timely fashion.  The area of town is great! You are minutes from pretty much anything you could need (grocery store, drug store, various restaurants, shopping).  Since we had to break our lease early we were charged nearly $1500 to terminate our lease and now the complex wants an additional $635 because of cleaning and carpet repair.  Now I'm sorry, but I am not paying them for something that they are obligated to do. They would have to clean the apartment and clean and replace the carpet anyway. Why should have to reimburse them?  It's not as if my husband and I left the place all that dirty. I admit we didn't vaccum, but I'm not going to do a deep cleaing and scrub ceilings to floors.  I give this complex three stars based on that I would recommend living here as long as you don't plan to terminate your lease early and the fact that the Ahwatukee area is just great and I enjoyed the location of this complex as I could walk or drive most places and be there in minutes. It's a very conveinent location

I stated this in my first review, but now these assholes have turned us over to a collections. Okay, I realized we probably should have just paid the damn $635 for the cleaning that the apartment complex is obligated to do anyway, so we would avoid collections, but I stand my ground that I don't think we should have to pay this extra money! I just can't believe this place, in total charged us over $2100 to break our lease early!  Equity Residental and Sedona Ridge are effing crooks!!

my husband and I ate here a few months back and really enjoyed the food. The service was excellent. I found all of the staff to be quiet friendly.  It is very expensive. For two people you will spend about $70, depending on what you get. My husband and I had two meals and a glass of wine each.  I think as far as Italian food goes this is the best I have had so far in Phoenix.

After reading the reviews of this place it reminded me that this was one of the first places I went looking for a dress over a year ago for my wedding.  I had found a dress in a bridal magazine that was exactly what I wanted. I did some research and found that this was one of the only stores in town that could order this dress. I went into the store and was greeted by a really pushy sales lady. I told her what dress I wanted and they found it in the catalog and said they could order it.  She then said how they needed half of the money that day to hold the dress. I said "I don't have that kind of money right now, so that is not possible." She then said "this is the dress you want, right?" "yes" I said, "but I don't have $600 to put down today." The lady kept pushing to put money down. I told her that I could come in later in the week to put money down and she seemed very disappointed that I wouldn't give them money that day. She said she would call me the following week to check up.  Come the following day, not week, the lady calls me asking when that day I was coming in. I said "I'm not coming in today, I told you next week."  After all the pushiness and the fact the dress cost way  more than I could afford was the reason I did not want to deal with these people.  The really don't seem to care about the customer, just the customers money. I would not recommend this place!

mmmm, Ted's is sooo good! I love their onion rings. Great hot dogs too. My complaints about Ted's, they only accept cash. I never carry cash, so I rarely eat at Ted's and anytime I go there is a huge line, but I can deal with that, they try and get everyone through pretty quickly.

funny I have yet to review this place considering I eat here at least once a week.   I love the food. The Straw sandwich is one of my faves. It's pastrami or corned beef with cole slaw and kraut on a bread of your choosing.   Everyday they have a daily special. Tuesdays are a good day as the specials are turkey with all the trimmings or meatloaf. The meatloaf is very tasty. The last time I ordered it I thought the mashed potatoes that came with it were a bit too whippped up. I like my potatoes slightly lumpy.  This place is usually packed around lunch time, so beware as the lines can be long, but usually go fast.   I have been here for breakfast and dinner and those are the less busy times. It can almost be a ghost town around those times.  I recommened breakfast here as it's very good and affordable. Where I think their prices for lunch and dinner are a bit much, breakfast is pretty cheap and you get a decent amount of food.

I've been eating here on and off for about 6 years and the sanwiches are always great.  Even with new owners (which I think at this point they aren't that new anymore) the food quality has not changed. I've never gotten one bad sandwich from here. The service is always fast and friendly.   The one drawback is the parking. They are in a tiny plaza with a few other businesses and the parking is very slim.   Lunch time is very busy, probably best to call ahead and place a to go order.   Not much else to say about this place. It's a small sandwich shop with great food and service.

This place has been around forever, I have lived in PHX all my life and yesterday was the first time I have eaten here.  My husband and our friend drove over yesterday. We were in the need of good food and beer and we got just that at the Wineburger.  I realize they are known for their burgers, but when I saw they had pork tenderloin on the menu I had to have it.   The boys ordered burgers and we split an order of onion scoops and fried zucchini. The onion scoops were awesome! They are fried onion petals and in the breading are bits of red pepper. After a while the onion scoops get a tad spicy, but they are tasty.  They have a decent selection of beer by the bottle, but if you get a pitcher you are limited to Molson or Coors.   The pork tenderloin sandwich was good, but a bit of a disappointment. My family is from the midwest and I know good tenderloin and the Wineburgers is just ok. They put cheese on it which was good, but kind of weird too because I'm used to my tenderloin with basic mustard and onion.  My husband and our friend said the burgers were tasty. Next time I'll have to try one.  On this particular day the service was pretty slow, but it was very friendly. I think they may have been a little under staffed and that is understandable.  The prices are pretty reasonable. For two burgers, one tenderloin, two appetizers and two pitchers of beer the total was less than $40. Not too bad because we left very full and a tad tipsy.  All in all I dig the Wineburger. It reminds me of a bar in the midwest. I felt totally comfortable here. Since I live pretty much within walking distance I will definitely be back.

The Eye Opener is a good ol' greasy spoon where I always find a seat and service is always polite and friendly. The prices are very reasonable and the food good.   Sometimes the bacon isn't as crispy as I would like it and the corned beef hash is kinda sloppy, but for the most part the food is good and for two people you can expect to spend less than $20.  One of my complaints is that they have those metal creamer containers on the tables. This has always grossed me out at any restaurant that does this. Who knows what the last customer did to the creamer. On my last visit I saw a kid drink straight from the container.   I can always depend on this place for friendly service and good, cheap meal.

Mmmmm, the orange blossom beer is worth the trip every time. I dream of this beer. It's like if Blue Moon beer and an orange creamscicle had a baby.  The food is also yummy too. Not your typical bar food which I like. My only complaint is that I wish they would serve a cheese dip with the big, soft pretzel instead of mustard.  This place gets pretty packed and is loud, so don't expect to carry much of a conversation with anyone.  I think this place is a good hang out spot that has a wonderful and large beer selection and great food. I just wish I would have frequented this place more often when I lived in the neighborhood.

a lot of bands I listen to end up playing the Marquee. It's  not a horrible venue, but yeah, the parking sucks and so do the security. As if I didn't pay enough for the tickets, now I have to pay $5 to park and then get  hassled by security so they can sift through my purse and make me take my shoes off.  Note to girls, don't take a purse and if you do don't bring in a pen as they will make you thow it away. Wearing slip on shoes is best so you don't have to hassle with your laces.  Sometimes, but not always security gets a little weird about where you can sit and lean. I was once told I couldn't sit on the floor with my back to the wall. Why?! So if I have a bad back and standing for a few hours is making my back worse I'm not allowed to sit down. OK.

This update is not because I went back to Rosie's, but to share the comment I received from my server. I really think it's in poor taste she felt the need to contact me and makes me NEVER want to give business to Rosie's ever again. In my review I relayed the events as they happened, I'm not going to sugar coat it. I still think the cost of my friends drinks should not have been charged to me and it's not that my friends are "unreliable dining compainions", it was not their fault their drinks were not charged to them and they didn't notice. The server is the one who rang up the order and made the mistake, she should own up to it, not blame my friends or get pissy with me. It's really too bad that I don't want to give my business to Rosie's because I really do like it there and I really wasn't that upset with the server, just the situation. I still stand by the fact the drinks wrongfully charged to me should not have been my responsiblity. Doesn't matter if the drinks belonged to my friends, I shouldn't have had to pay for the mistake the server made.   Here is her comment: I was your server that evening and do not appreciate that you feel servers should have to pay out of our own pockets for your friends mistakes.  We seperate checks to make things more convienent for you.  Most places do not allow split checks.  I am sorry your friends skipped out on their portion of the tab.  Maybe you should find more reliable dining companions. As for the one beer on your tab, that indeed was my mistake and if my memory serves me correctly, i quickly and kindly apologized for MY mistake and swiftly removed it from your tab without any friction. Can't wait to see you again soon.  Rosie's always tries to give a good experience to it's customers.

this place is so great. I love the food!! The Europa is one of my fave sandwiches on the menu. They have a great selection of booze and their ice tea is good. I wish I lived closer to the area as I would ate here more often. Unfortunatley the service has always been fairly slow anytime I have been in here. Most time I visit my husband and I are one of the only customers in the place and it's as if we are invisible.

definitely love the food here. I've only been here twice, but each time the food has been wonderful and the service fast and friendly.  I would recommend the machaca, carnitas and jen red quesadilla (sweet and sour).  I do like how the food comes in a tinfoil container, so if I want to get my food to go all I need is a lid and it's ready for carry out.   My one complaint is there is no ice tea. They do have Lipton tea from the fountain, but that's not tea, I don't know what that swill is. If only they would get some fresh brewed tea, this place would get five stars.

Who knew there was something good in Sunnyslope?  After reading the reviews on Yelp, my husband and I decided to check out Corbin's for Sunday brunch. Upon entering we were greeted right away and taken to a booth.  Our really friendly server was at the table right away and took our drink orders. My husband ordered a bloody bull (a bloody mary with a few extra ingredients) and I ordered a ramos fizz, a boozy, creamy fruity drink on ice. Both drinks were very delicious.   For food my husband ordered a quesadilla with ham and carmelized onions. I ordered the Eggs Bayou, which is poached eggs and ham on top of toasted french bread and a side of potatoes.   I enjoyed the atmosphere of Corbin's. It's has a fairly modern look and is pretty laid back.  The food was very tasty and I look forward to going back and trying out their other dishes.

I've been going to this place for years back when it was called Dee's. I would usually go here for breakfast on the weekends, but I don't live as close as I used to and the last time I ate breakfast here the service was not great nor was my server all that polite. She was too busy catering to the douche bag behind me to refill my iced tea when I did ask for more. Also when she brought out our food she asked if we needed anything else and didn't even wait for a reply, she just walked away. Hmm, no I guess I don' t need anything else, but thanks for asking anyway.  So now I only order take out for lunch as I work on the same side of town.  Aside from that one lousy server in the past the other servers have always been polite.  This place has some pretty good food. I recommend the California crepe, which is filled with veggies and cheese.  Their gyros are also very good. Tender gyro meat and soft pita.  Their salads are also very large and filling.  Though it's no longer on the menu, I think you can still order their veggie sandwich served on pita, with a layer of hummus and veggies. Very yummy! This place does get very busy during breakfast and lunch. I'm not sure about dinner.

after reading the reviews on Yelp and driving by the store many times I finally had an opp to check this store out yesterday.  This shop is filled with all sorts of wonderful things. I found many things I wanted to buy, but most were totally out of my price range or I just couldn't justify spending $65 for a necklace with a squirrel on it, despite the squirrel being so adorable and I know I would wear the heck out it, still $65 for a necklace was not in my budget.  I did find some good deals as they had a sale going on. I picked up a cute tank top.  They had some real cute baby stuff that made me want to start popping out kids just to buy some of the cute little outfits.   The gal working the store was really nice and helpful.   This is one of my new favorite stores and I look forward to having some money to blow on a cute outfit or a squirrel necklace.

So currently the hubby and I are in the process of buying a house. We had to drive out to North Scottsdale to sign some paperwork and since we were in the area we stopped in at The Skeptical Chymist for dinner and drinks.   I found the price of food and drinks to be slightly pricey and that would be my only complaint about this place.  The food however is very tasty. I ordered the fish and chips and my husband ordered the mustard crusted tenderloin stuffed with spinach. I got a bit of food envy when I tasted my husbands food. I would recommend ordering that dish. The fish and chips were decent. You get a big beer battered filet which is nicely seasoned with thick chips.  Being a proud Irish lass I enjoy Irish pubs that actually play great Irish music and Skeptical Chymist does a great job. Sure you hear the cliche, popular bands like U2 and The Cranberries, but they also played The Pogues and some traditional Irish songs.   The place had a great look and feel to it. They really made it look as close to a traditional Irish pub and I felt really comfortable just hanging out and drinking my Smithwicks.  On this particular evening the place was pretty sparse, not many people, but I'm sure on weekends this place gets hoppin'.  The fact that this place played The Pogues should warrant a five star review, but because I find the prices to be slightly high they only get four stars. I would definitley go back if I'm in the neighborhood again.

my husband, our friend and myself ate at Lil Mama's yesterday and had a real pleasant experience. My husband and I both ordered the chicken and waffles and our friend got the rib plate.  We all split an ordered of fried okra. The breading on the okra was great. Not too much breading, it was just right and seasoned well.   The chicken and waffles plate really hit the spot. The chicken was yummy! The seasoning was so good. The waffle was decent. Not real crisp, but not too soggy. I found it to be just right.  The sweet tea was great! It was prepared just how I like it. It wasn't overly sweet at all.   I enjoyed the hot sauce that was on the table. I'm not sure if it's a home made sauce, but it had a good taste. The smell and taste weren't pungent like most hot sauces. It wasn't loaded with vinegar.   The service was friendly and quick.   I'll be living closer to the old 'hood soon, so I'll be able to enjoy the food at Lil Mama's more often.

Pugzie's is a place I've driven by many times, but never had the opportunity to eat there because my schedule didn't align with theirs. Well now that I'm unemployed I have lots of spare time and I've been to Pugzie's at least three times.  I end up getting the half tuna sandwich with pasta salad or soup everytime.  I like their tuna salad as they add a bit of hard boiled egg and water chestnuts to it.  The pasta salad is decent, but not the best I've ever had. Their baked goods are very yummy. I usually end up getting a brownie. They are so soft and moist. The top layer of the brownie is a yummy swirl of vanilla and chocolate while the rest is all chocolate.   This place is huge and I agree with another reviewer that they could add a bathroom to this place. I don't like that they have a shared outside bathroom with the rest of the office complex.

my husband and I would frequent this place in the mornings before work and order a couple of drinks and get their tasty breakfast sandwich.  we haven't been here in while as we don't have as much time in the mornings. The owners are really nice and they do good things for the art community.

my husband and I ate here last night for the first time after living down the street from this place for nearly three years.  The food is ok, but I've definitley had better Chinese food. The won ton soup was not very good. The broth was a bright yellow color which should have been my clue that it wasn't going to taste too good. The won tons were too doughy and after a few spoonfuls I was done.  The lo mein, stuffed mushrooms and the california rolls were decent.   One thing I did not get, but my husband tried out was chicken feet. Yep, a claw! It made me sick just looking at this claw on his plate. He said it wasn't very good.   I didn't use the bathroom here, but my husband did and he said the bathroom alone made him never want to go back to this place. He said it was filthy and run down. Also the ice cream scooper in the dessert area had been sitting in a bucket of ice cream water and my husband said it looked as if there were teeth marks on the scooper. I just envisioned some little kid gnawing on the scooper at some point for it to look like that.   This place wasn't horrible, the service was friendly and I'm sure if I ever have the beer munchies I would hit this place up.

Based on reviews from my fellow Yelpers I decided to switch from Walgreen's to Melrose Pharmacy.   I went in earlier this week to drop off my prescription. Upon entering the pharmacy I felt I was transported into an old fashioned drug store. The whole layout of the store reminds of something you might see on "Leave It To Beaver."   There were a few people ahead of me, but once I was greeted the service was very friendly. Since it was my first time getting a prescription filled they got all my info and told me my order would be ready the next day.  I didn't get a chance to look at everything they offer in the store, but looks like most of the things you can get at Walgreen's or CVS, plus some great stuff like bottled soda, aroma therapy oils, home made soaps...  So far I am very happy that I switched to Melrose and look forward to continue to use their services. Sure, it's easier to use Walgreen's or CVS because there is one on every corner in just about every town, but I appreciate the friendly and helpful service that Melrose provides.

I've always had issues with this cable company. They always raise their prices, even though I've seen ads on tv saying how they don't raise their prices, but the other companies do.  Oooh Cox, you little liars.  The past month I have had issues with channels not working and when you call Cox, they tell you it's no them and it's that particular network, so the issue is say with the TLC network and not Cox. Um ok!  Damn it! I'm trying to watch a "What Not To Wear" marathon and TLC is not coming in! Fix it you effers!  Their service is just down right expensive and there are all these little fees that seem ridiculous to pay for.   For months we have been trying to get the phone number on file changed as they have an old phone #, but they never make the change.   I'm pretty fed up with their service, but really the area of town I live in I don't have much of a choice but to use their service for cable and internet.

ARGH!! How I hate Cox Cable!! So the hubby and I just moved to our new house. My husband tried a week ago to transfer services over, but the guy he talked to said they couldn't do it yet as the current homeowners still have their services turned on. The guy assured my husband that we could call the day we move into our new home and services would be switched on.   So, we move in, call Cox and no can do! This other guy says that someone has to come to the house to turn on a switch and they can't come until the next day and they will be there anytime from 7am-7pm. Come 6pm last night and still no cable or 'net.  We call and Cox is closed!  This morning they say that someone did indeed go to the house and turn the cable on, but the funny thing is we still don't have cable or 'net!  I hate this company. Nobody knows what the hell they are talking about or what they are doing over there!

The hubby and I finally made it out to Z Pizza over the weekend.   I ordered the Moroccan and my husband had the Greek pizza. Both pizzas were very tasty. The carmelized onions and pine nuts on the Moroccan were simply yummy!  I think the prices are a little high, but the pizza is pretty good.   There weren't many customers in that night which made for a nice and quiet dinner. The feel of the place seemed pretty laid back to me and I felt comfortable.  The serivce was fast and friendly.   They have a small, but great drink selection, offering Sweet Leaf Teas, Blue Moon, Stella Artois and of course fountain drinks.  I will definitley be back to try their other pizzas out.

Thank you fellow Yelpers for not failing me.   I just moved into a house and wanted to get all the locks changed. I called a locksmith that my realtor suggested and that guy couldn't even make an appointment. As he put it "Wednesday is too early to make an appointment for Friday. Call me Friday and I'll let you know if I can come out." Eff that! So I jump on Yelp search for locksmith and find the great reviews for Jeff.  My husband called Jeff on Thursday and he gladly made an appointment for 8am on Friday.   Jeff showed up on time and gave me my options and he got straight to work.   He is a friendly guy and only charged $105 to change out four locks.   I found his professionalism, friendliness and prices to be awesome! If I ever need a locksmith again I would call Jeff.

my husband and I along with a couple of friends ate here on Saturday night. It was the first time for me and the hubby eating here. We arrived early and had some time to kill. We walked the property and the nearby housing development.   The food was great! My husband ordered one of the pizzas, which was big enough for one person or for two with small appetites to share. I ordered the farm burger with bleu cheese and a side of fried zucchini. The zucchini was pretty fresh tasting which is nice when you are used to prepackaged frozen stuff.  I was a little apprehensive about eating outdoors because you are in a farming area with lots of bugs and I did see a sign near a tree that said to beware of falling scorpions. Yikes!! I was pretty much on the look out for bugs the entire time.   I would love to go here for breakfast sometime as they have some really tasty sounding dishes.   The food is a bit on the pricey side, but it is good.   I would assume this place is packed  most of the time, but on this night there was plenty of seating.   Be sure to check out the bathroom. On this particular night and perhaps everytime they were showing "Thunderbirds are Go" on the tv.

Just a little update. My husband and I ate breakfast here the other day. The line to order wasn't too long, but I have heard it can be out the door some mornings. I ordered the smoked salmon omellet with a side of fruit. The omellet was stuffed an a massive amount of cream cheese and minimal salmon. I found the salmon to be salty and there was simply too much cream cheese that I had to scrap off a big chunk. The fruit was good and fresh. I do enjoy eating outdoors when I come to Joe's, but I find myself trying to get away from bugs and making sure none fall in my food, so I may have to stick to eating inside. I'll still keep the four stars as I do enjoy dinner and the service has always been friendly and quick.

I pretty much don't care for any location of Pei Wei, but I'm reviewing this one as my office occassionally orders from this location.  I don't totally loathe Pei Wei (hence the two stars), but if I had a choice to eat there I wouldn't. Anytime I have gotten chicken lettuce wraps from here they are always very greasy.  Their wonton soup is pretty much broth with a couple of wontons.  The blazing noodles are ok, but are a bit too spicy for me.   The worst thing about this location is their teeny tiny parking lot. You can rarely ever find a parking space here. You can park around the corner in the neighborhood or across the street at the antique shop. If you plan to eat here on your lunch break from work good luck to you. You're better off getting take out. This place is so packed during the week for lunch you could probably spend your entire lunch hour and more waiting.

Went to Switch for the first time for brunch this past Sunday with the husband and a few friends.   Upon entering Switch I loved the decor and set up. I totally felt comfortable and enjoyed the whole atmosphere.   They played a lot of upbeat dance music and only wished they had a dancefloor.   The service was spot on and friendly. I couldn't have asked for better service.   I did feel bad for our server as one of my friends is totally picky about what she eats and how her food is prepared. It took her forever to figure out something she could actually eat. My friend is also one of the worst tippers of all time. I don't know how much she threw in for tip, but it better have been one hell of a good tip considering our server must have been driven mad because of her.   On to the food and drink. I LOVE that you can get $1 mimosas, cape cods, screwdrivers and bloody marys. Talk about gettin' trashed before noon. I could have stayed until 3pm when their $1 drink special ends. They don't skimp on the booze either. These drinks got me tipsy.  I had a hard time deciding what to order. Everything sounded so good. I decided on the egg stuffed crepes. The egg stuffed crepes had scrambled eggs, cheese, prosciutto and mushroom sauce. It also came with a side of potatoes. I very much recommend the egg stuffed crepes.   My husband ordered the breakfast gallette which is a puff pastry with eggs, sausage, cheeses, tomatoes and onions. After one bite this is another meal I would recommened.  I will definitley return to Switch for breakfast and would like to try out lunch and/or dinner.  I can only hope we didn't put out the server too much with the way my friend orders and tips. I think his name was Anthony and he was totally awesome and I hope we didn't put him out too much.

Tried Johnnie's for the first time this past Saturday. They have a good selection of hot dogs with a variety of toppings and Italian beef sandwiches. I ordered the garbage dog. Sounds disgusting, right? Wrong, it was great!  The owner says "do you know what comes on that dog?" I said "yeah, all this great stuff!"  He said "no, it's yesterdays garbage." and then he laughed.   The garbage dog comes with chili, cheese, kraut and cole slaw. For a side I got the fries. They were pretty good, but a tad burnt, but I didn't mind they were still good. You can tell they are homemade, no frozen fries here.  My husband ordered the Italian Beef sandwich and he said that was really good.  The owner, is a really great and friendly guy.   The only thing I was disappointed in was they have no fresh brewed tea. It's Lipton from the fountain, which I'm not crazy about, but I'll drink it if I'm thristy.

Oh Bev Mo how I miss you!!!  I used to live five minutes from this location and would shop here at least once a week.  Bev Mo is an alcoholics paradise! They stock hard to find beers and wines that you won't find at most liquor stores.   Now that I'm living in Central PHX I'm at least 15 minutes away from the nearest Bev Mo, so now I have to resort crappy, over priced liquor stores.  I have always found the prices at Bev Mo to be great and cheaper than you can get at the grocery store or liquor store.  They have an excellent selection of booze.

I love this place and was so sad when they closed down.   From what I know they are about to open their new location. I don't know when, but it's located on Southern and McClintock.

I love me some Mrs. White's. It's been a few years since I've eaten here and boy have I missed this place and their delicous food. On my recent visit I ordered the catfish with green beans and okra gumbo (a Friday only special) and to drink sweet tea. The sweet tea was just right. It wasn't overly sweet, it was perfect.  The food was just as great as I remembered. The catfish was seasoned just right. The okra gumbo was yummy with lots of okra, black eyed peas and corn. I had remembered that the menu was written on the wall, but to my surprise they had printed menus.  I noticed that they seem to be open on weekends now which is awesome because now I can enjoy Mrs. White's more often.

the hubby and I ate here this past weekend and found the food and service to be very nice.  We were greeted and seated right away.  We ordered an appetizer that was recommened by the waitress. I forget the name, but it was a pumpkin dish that had ground meat on top. Sounds odd, but was good. A little bit sweet, but the meat somewhat balanced the sweetness.  I ordered the subzi challow a spinach /lamb dish and my husband ordered a meatball dish. Some of the lamb pieces I found to be a bit fatty. Both meals were pretty decent.  Each table is served bread with three sauces. One sauce is a pesto type of sauce, second a yogurt sauce and third a red, slightly spicy sauce. All very good.  I would have enjoyed getting more bread. My husband and I only received two pieces each while the wait staff offered more bread to the table next to us at least four more times.  At the end of our meal we ordered their homemade vanilla ice cream topped with spices. It was very good and you could tell it was home made and not store bought.  I would pass on getting alcohol from here as even the cheap stuff like a bottle of Bud or Miller is $5 a bottle. I can get a six pack for $5 at the store.  I found my visit to Kabab Palace to be very good and I would go back.

Thanks to the lovely Lisa K. I checked out Glam Lounge looking for foundation by FACE atelier. Apparently this is the only store in the valley that sells that brand.   When I first entered I didn't know if it would be one of those snooty, upscale beauty shops or if the people working there would be cool. The gal that helped me out was very friendly.   I told her I was looking for FACE atelier, she pointed me in the right direction and also gave me a free sample. I was happy for the sample as I wasn't completely sure I wanted to spend over $30 for foundation.  After using the free sample of foundation and happy with the product I headed back to Glam Lounge to purchase a full bottle.   This store is very cute and clean and they have lots of great products like DDF which I'm a big fan of.   They also offer services like facials and waxing, which money allowing I would like to check out.   They also have great eco friendly shopping bags. I now have a mini tote bag that I can take back with me to haul my loot away.

I think this place is great. I love the cheesteaks and their sweet potato fries. I tried their homemade chili once and it was good, but I found it to be a bit soupy.  The staff is always friendly and the dining area is nice and clean.

I've been going to Lilo's since it first opened late in 2007. This place is great. The prices are very reasonable. The owner, Amy and her staff are just awesome and friendly people. The coffee and tea are always great. It's a great little neighborhood place and a welcome escape from the millions of Starbucks in the area.  Amy and her staff are always very accomodating. One day I asked for lemon in my iced tea and they didn't have any, but the next day they had lemon slices waiting. They will usual try and accomdate your request.

I checked this place out based on reviews on Yelp.  My husband is orginally from Louisiana so he is always looking to get some food from home.  Upon entering we were greeted right away and told to sit where ever we liked.  I was pleased they had Abita Purple Haze on tap. Abita is a beer brewed in Louisiana. Right away, off to a good start. We ordered the boudin balls as an app and they were very delicious. For our entrees I ordered the fried green tomato po boy and my husband ordered the crawfish etoufee.  Everything was very good. I will definitely go back.   The owner (at least I think he was the owner) talked with us and was a real friendly guy.  I really hope this place does well. It is in kind of a bad spot. Unless you know it's there you would probably just pass it up.

What can I say that hasn't already been said, so I'll keep this review fairly short.   My husband and I split a vegeterian pizza and it was very delicious. Big pieces of veggies and they all tasted pretty fresh and the crust was very good.  The service was weird and friendly. First the weird. One of the servers I asked if they had a wine list or served wine and he spoke so quiet I barely heard him, but he did say he would check and then he disappered for a few minutes, reappeared only to walk right by us. About 10 minutes later the owner (I think he is the owner) came by and asked me what kind of wine I liked, but by that time I had changed my mind.  I would say the only draw back is how small the place is. We were seated right next to the kitchen and it felt kind of cramped.   Other than that I very much enjoyed the pizza and look forward to ordering from there again. Their lasagna sounds very tasty so I would like to try it out sometime.

After Oliver and Annie closed I had to find a new place to buy my furry children some food.   Noble Beast is a good replacement for O&A and I'm glad there is another wonderful, local pet store.  The couple of times I have gone here the service is always great. Someone has always greeted me with a smile and I like that.  They don't sell the cat food I had been feeding my cats, so I went with a new kind which I wasn't sure the cats would like (and they didn't), so the person working that day gave me a bunch of little samples to take home and I'm glad she did. I found a few in the bunch that the cats like to eat, so I'm feeding the cats Dick Van Patten's cat food. I guess after "Eight is Enough" the man needed something to do.   Since I'm not big on stores like Petsmart, I'm happy that places like Noble Beast are around.

The carpets in my house have been in dire need of cleaning. After seeing Deb's review of Epic I figured they must be good. My husband gave them a call and they were able to work with our schedule. I loved how prompt they were to return a call and make an appointment. I was amazed how clean the carpet was after the cleaning. You never would have known how dirty they were before.  Epic does an awesome job at an affordable price. They are prompt and friendly. I will definitley use them again.

Ate here for the first time last night. My husband and I were meeting some friends for dinner before a concert and we picked this place to meet at.  In my opinion I think the prices are kind of high for what you get.  My husband and I are on a bit of a budget right now so we choose to split a taco plate. The tacos were decent and the sopapillas that come with the meal were good.  The restaurant is very nice and our server was extremely nice and helpful.  I probably wouldn't go back as I can get cheaper and better Mexican food elsewhere and also I don't live in the Glendale area.   The place is definitely good for large groups.  Our server and free sopapillas was the best part of the experience.

My husband and I ate at Curry Leaf last night and were very pleased. This place is family owned, has been open about three months and is located in a strip mall near a Basha's. The place is small and sparsley decorated, but I came to eat not look at stuff on the wall. The service was very friendly and prompt.  Both my husband and I ordered chicken curry dishes with chapathi which is a whole wheat flour flat bread.  The food was very tasty and flavorful. I was getting full, but could not stop eating as I found it that good.   As we finished eating one of the owners came out and we talked with him for a while. He explained how they prepare the food and their goal is for fresh and healthy food.  The wife prepares and cooks all of the food and the husband and daughter help out in front.   I'm definitley a fan and intended to go back soon as the food was delicious and the owners are very friendly.

I highly enjoy this place and my husband and I have been back many times since our first visit. I very much enjoy the food and the owners are so friendly and really go out of their way to make sure you have a good experience.  I understand everyone is entitled to their opinion, so for those that did not enjoy this place your opinion is valid, but I don't understand how you had such a horrible experience. I also don't understand why the reviews had to be so nit pickey.   For the reviewer that nit picked about the tables and chairs, big deal! Shouldn't you focus on the food and not the decor? I know I go to a restaurant for food not decor.   I think the same reviewer remarked that the veggies are frozen, quiet the opposite. The owners pride themselves on the freshness of their food.   Having spoken to the owners I think they know how to run a business and if more people give them a chance I think they will suceed and they are listening to these Yelp reviews and taking what we say about them into consideration, which is more than I can say for most restaurant owners in this town who don't seem to care a whole lot what their patrons say.  I know not everyone will have the same experience, but I can say that I like this place and it's just too bad the other reviewers didn't enjoy what Curry Leaf has to offer.

I've gotten take out here at least three times and have never been disappointed.   The pork and fish tacos and burritos are very tasty.  I like their green salsa, but it does get a bit spicy after a while.   You know most places might load their burritos and tacos with rice, cheese or lettuce, but not Two Hippies. They don't skimp on the meat.  The tacos and burritos are loaded with chicken or pork or fish... I wish they would add a bit more pinto beans to their burritos.  I'm not sure if their tortilla chips are store bought, but the chips do seem like they are Tostinos brand.  I find the prices to be very reasonable. Good sized burritos for $4, a three pack of tacos for the same price.  I don't know if I would sit and eat here as the place is so compact. Sure they have there patio area, but overall the place is kind of tiny, so I just usually call it in and pick it up. If they ever serve some booze I just might sit and eat on their patio.

I've been to Papa Joe's at least four or five times and have always had great service and food.   They serve up fish, shrimp, ribs, pulled pork, wonderful side dishes like hush puppies and fried okra.  Each time I've been to Papa Joe's I have ordered the one piece spicy catfish (which isn't spicy) and two shrimp. The plate comes with fries, but you can substitute for a different side. I recommend the jalapeno hush puppies. They aren't spicy, like the jalapeno would indicate and are addictively yummy.  I've never had the pulled pork sandwich, but my husband has and says it's really good.   They make home made sweet potatoe pie, which I have yet to try, but I certainly will soon as it looks soooo good.  The people that own Papa Joe's are very friendly and accomodating and aside from the good food the people make it worth coming back.

My husband and I checked out Oliver and Annie this past weekend. We found the place to be so friendly and charming. We were greeted right away by the owner (I think he was the owner) and he was so helpful and knowledgable. He pointed out many items and gave us the background on the items.   We found so much great stuff for our cats. We only picked up some treats to give to the cats, but I plan to go back and try out some more items.   Some of their products can be a tad pricey, but I'm sure worth it as most products I looked at were all organic, SLS free, hand made, locally made... and look, I'm a frugal person, so I'm always looking to save a few pennies, but for the health of my cats I will spend the extra bucks on the products at Oliver and Annie.  I found so much I wanted to buy for my cats, but was kind of on a budget, so I'll have to go back and stock up on shampoo and toys for my feline friends.  Chris, the owner (who is totally awesome by the way) was saying how they take in kittens and clean them up and do adoptions. I thought that was so awesome and made me happy there was a store like this and people like this that care so much about animals.

My husband and I are always looking for new breakfast places to try and after coming across Christina P.'s review, Scramble sounded worthy of trying out.   When you enter you order at the counter, then you are given a number and wait for your meal at your table.   I found the menu to offer a nice amount of delicious sounding meals. I debated between carmelized banana pancakes, vanilla peach pancakes, pigs in a blanket or one of the brizza's (breakfast pizza). Both my husband and I ordered brizza's. He got the gouda and bacon and I ordered the garlic spinach and mushroom pizza.  The wait for food was at least 20 minutes, but they were pretty busy this morning and seeing as they are pretty new I wasn't bothered.   The brizza's were very tasty. I like how the scrambled egg was all thru out the pizza and not just a lump of eggs plopped on top of the pizza. The gouda and bacon pizza tasted similar to a breakfast sandwich. I found it to be a bit cheesy, but still good.  The garlic spinach and mushroom pizza was also very good. I think the crust for the pizza's needs a bit more flavor, but it's not bad.  One this day Scramble was very busy and their beverage area is located in the middle of the restaurant and when this place is busy it becomes slightly unnerving to manuver around the drink area.   I look forward to going back and trying out the pancakes and southwestern breakfast burrito.  My only complaint, one of their tv's was tuned to Fox News, but hey I'm there to eat not watch tv.

Each time I've been to Sapna the food has been excellent! I've only had breakfast here and each time I order the frittata of the day. My husband has ordered the pumpkin pancakes and oh my god, these are some of the best pancakes I have ever had. The syrup is so yummy. I'm drooling just thinking of them.  We have also had the Calcutta egg roll, which is worth a try, but not sure I would get it again and the pork tacos which were just delicious.  The Moraccan mint tea is very tasty. A very refreshing iced tea with fresh mint leaves.   I love the food, but have to say the service is a bit hit or miss. As other Yelpers have said, you could be the only person in the place and hardly see your server. It's a small place, so I don't know how one person could go unnoticed. Really, the service isn't much to complain about as the food is so good I can kind of overlook the service.  I think once this place catches on they will have a line out the building like Matt's Big Breakfast and rightly so as I think the food is far more superior.

definitley one of my favorite restaurants in the valley. Tandoori Times never disappoints. Their naan bread is excellent. Any dish I have ordered has always been delicious.  Tandoori Times is good for a romantic dinner or a casual get together with friends or family.

I've been to Luci's once and was fairly impressed with their marketplace area. I did not try their coffee, so I can't comment on that, but I glanced at their menu and the coffee selection seems decent.  I love that I can find all the great organic and non SLS beauty products here. They also carry my new favorite snack, Bumble Bars in assorted flavors.   The day I went my husband and I were greeted by a very friendly employee who told us about some upcoming things they plan to do such as cooking classes in the store.   I do find their prices on certain items to be a bit high.   If you shop places like Healthy Habit and/or Trader Joe's this place is somewhat similar.  Only complaint is the parking lot, but I've had issues with that lot for years.

As the name would indicate this place is fairly tiny. Upon entering every table was taken, so my husband and I sat at their counter area. We were greeted and given menus right away.  I knew I would love this place when I asked for iced tea I was given the option of sweet tea. I love sweet tea and it's hard to get some in Arizona. My husband ordered coffee, but our server made the mistake of giving him sweet tea as well, but my husband didn't complain as he is a southern boy who loves his sweet tea.  Both my husband and I ordered omelettes. He the Spanish and me a Denver.  Both omelettes were very tasty and so fluffy they were like scrambled fluffy clouds.   The hash browns were great. They are not frozen or from a bag. The potatoes are fresh cut and delicious.   Tiny's also has their own yummy homemade salsa, which I pour on just about anything I order.   Our server never left us with empty drink cups or even half empty. Most anytime she walked by she checked on us and refilled our drinks.   The counter area is a good place to sit as you get to see the food prepared right in front of you and experience the hustle of the cafe.   I will definitley be back for the wonderful food and spot on, friendly service.  Since this review my husband and I have been to Tiny's a number of times. We love it here. The service and food are always spot on.   On our last visit we ordered the milk toast which is buttered toast with cinnamon and sugar in a bowl and served with hot milk. It's almost like the cereal Cinnamon Toast Crunch, but way better. Maybe it sounds odd, but it's worth a try. We also ordered the hillbilly benedict which is biscuits with eggs, bacon and their homemade gravy poured all over it. It's delicious.

Smeeks should really advertise itself as a novelty shop, not a candy shop. There is barely any candy in the place.   This place is hella expensive. I saw so many cute and kooky things, but with what they charge I wouldn't buy anything.   I was fairly disappointed with my visit to Smeeks. I left with two pieces of candy and paid $4! Are you kidding me?! I could go to Walgreen's and get 10 candy bars for that price.   A few cool things, they have a photo booth and an abundance of novelty gifts, but they lack a wide and good seleciton of candy and their prices are outrageous.

pros -close to my house -good, inexpensive pizza  cons -only takes cash -atm with a $1.50 fee -to go only -meat on mediterrean pizza was kind of tough and chewy -does not serve iced tea  I do like the Two Hippies chains, although I have not eaten at the burger or breakfast place. My problem with these places is that they don't take cash and I rarely carry cash. I'm not gonna go out of my way to stop at an ATM, I'm gonna go somewhere else that takes a debit card. Also I'm not one for canned sodas and sugary drinks and Two Hippies does not serve fresh brewed iced tea and I feel like I'm getting ripped off if I pay for bottled water when I can get water at home for free.   If they would tweak a couple of things I would frequent the Two Hippies chains more often.

My in-law's were staying at the Biltmore for the weekend, so we checked out Frank and Albert's for dinner on Sunday night.  The prices are pretty steep, but it's within a resort so you have to expect your meatloaf dinner to be over $20. We sampled many different dishes such as the turkey meatloaf with mashed potatoes and mixed veggies within the potatoes, empanadas, pizza and the yummy and not too greasy hamburger served on an English muffin. I found the food to be very good, but a bit pricey.  Our server Alexis was awesome! She was so friendly and made sure we had everything we needed.  I didn't get to try any of their desserts, but everything on the dessert menu sounded delicious.  Despite the high prices I would go back.

I love booze, so clearly I love Total Wine.   When I first heard of it I assumed it was a total BevMo knock off, but dare I say it's better than BevMo. I think the selection is a bit better, but the prices are the same.   They sell more than wine and have a great beer selection. My favorite latest find is Samuel Smith's Organic Cherry Beer. You will totally forget you are drinking beer. It's like a carbonated cherry juice that gets you tipsy.   The selection, service and prices at Total Wine are great and I'm glad I don't have to drive too far for good hooch.

I went to The Compound strictly to see a band play. I did not try any of the food, so I can only comment on this place as a music venue.   The Compound really needs to rethink the set up of this place. It's more of a resaurant and any band playing there almost gets resigned to background music. I don't like the set up of the tables. It's just not great for watching a band. You have the servers passing by every few minutes to take orders and deliver food to tables. This is distracting for someone trying to enjoy the music.  I think it would be best if the restaurant was seperated from the stage area.  Though the band I saw at The Compound was awesome, I would probably not go back to The Compound for a concert unless it was a band I was truly dying to see. The set up of this place I find just that bad.  I may go back to try the food, but as far as seeing a band here the experience wasn't that great to make me come back for a concert.

I just got home from Sweets N Beats and I already want to go back for more candy and vinyl.   This place is a small shop specializing in music and old school candy. They are nestled between The Trunk Space and The Bikini Lounge. I found lots of great records ranging from Talking Heads, various ska bands and a Rudy Ray Moore album. Good selection of yummy candy like squirrel nut zippers (a chewy, nutty candy), lemon heads, cherry heads, bubble gum cigrars and cigarettes.  They also have a selection of books, t-shirts and novelty items.   Definitley check Sweets N Beats out. It's a great addition to the downtown area and it's owned by two wonderful people.  Cash only here folks, so bring the green. Everything is pretty cheap, so you can walk out with a bag of candy under $3.

FYI, this place is membership only as I was so rudely told upon entering the store.   I have driven past this store numerous times and today my husband and I attempted to check it out.   We walked in and behind me I hear the yells of "hey, hey!" I turn around and the girl at the counter asks "do you have a membership?" "No, I didn't know I needed one." I replied. "This store is not open to the public, ok? Sorry."   The better thing to say would have been to ask if I would like to open a membership and not be so rude and turn away business.  Here's a store I will not be giving my business to.

I've never been much for having to get clothes altered because I hate having to spend money on clothes and then extra money just to get them altered. But if I have learned anything from Stacey and Clinton on 'What Not To Wear' it's that you have visit a tailor because not everything in the store is going to fit exactly right. I'm so glad I found The Fit. They do excellent work. I have taken a few pants here to be hemmed. I'm a shorty and no pants ever fit perfect on me. Every time I have been here the service is very friendly and the work they do is wonderful. I've always found it hard to find a good place to get my clothes altered, but I have definitley found the place at The Fit.

I know I'm not alone in my good review of this place, but I am suprised at the bad to so-so reviews, but to each their own.  I really like this place. I love going here for a boozy brunch and having the same wonderful server (I'm sorry I never got your name, but you are awesome and always friendly).  Two for Tuesdays and getting yummy burgers served on pretzel bread with a plate of fries and my choice of beer or wine is a great deal. The mac n' cheese is yummy too and dare I say better than my own husbands.  The cheese crisp is more like oversized nachos, but still good.  Everything I have ordered has been perfectly delicious. I have always had wonderful and friendly service. I agree this is no place to sit on the patio during the sweaty summer months and the music is a bit bland and too top 40, but I enjoy the yummy food and boozy drinks.  I will continue to go here almost weekly.
