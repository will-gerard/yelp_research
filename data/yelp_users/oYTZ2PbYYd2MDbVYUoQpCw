I've stayed at the Homewood chain in various cities and am a big fan.  The chain itself is great for extended stays, family vacations or even the overnight stay.  I appreciate having the extra space when traveling for work and or with the family.  The extra amenities are a plus when traveling on a budget. Free wifi, breakfast and parking!  PLUS points!  On a recent visit, this particular location wasn't very full.  After checking in, we went to the room and found a moldy smell.  Possibly coming from the carpets, but definitely the shower curtain in the bathroom.  I went to talk to the staff at the front desk.  Josh had checked me in earlier and was still there.  He heard me out and immediately switched rooms taking note of the odor we discovered.  For the trouble, he upgraded us to a larger suite.  PLUS points!  Good guy and very personable and helpful.  Overall a nice stay with the family!  Keep on Yelp'n!

While visiting Phoenix, my girls wanted to go horseback riding.  My wife looked up a few places that were nearby and we happened by the Ponderosa Stables.  This place has typically 4+ stars for a reason.  They're friendly, fun and priced reasonably.  The horses are well groomed and appear to be well taken care of.  The staff we encountered were all very hospitable and professional.  Dan, the head wrangler, was easy going and kept my girls entertained while waiting for our ride to start.  Pickles, our guide was great and offered our girls some treats to feed the horses after the ride.    All in all a great experience.  Keep on Yelp'n!

Such an amazing show.  Saw it first almost 15 years ago.  I almost forgot various parts of the show since it has been such a long time.  Looks like some has changed, but overall still magnificent!  It's fun, awe inspiring, daring and adventurous all in one.  I love the Cirque du Soleil shows!  As you enter the theatre lobby, you will see various sculptures representing parts of the show.  Beautiful works!  There are photographers awaiting to take pics of you and your group to commemorate the event.  The actual seating area isn't huge, but can probably accommodate close to 1200 or so (just my guesstimate).  I was lucky enough to grab a seat in section 103 (center) in the last row.  I'd prefer this to the front so you can see the whole stage without having to look left and right to see different parts of the show.    The show is held at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, one of our favorites.  The acts include clowns, dancers, gymnasts, divers, body contortionists and acrobats.  Each scene has it's own theme and will blow you away with laughter or amaze you with feats of strength, balance and super human ability.  Make sure you arrive on time so not to miss any of the early audience interactions.  During the show, the stage morphs back and forth into pools which are used by swimmers and divers.  You'll be amazed at how there are dancers doing their thing on stage one moment and then divers jumping into pools from the rafters the next.  It's a great Cirque show.  Keep on Yelp'n!

So happy to have found The Signature at MGM Grand!  If you want to experience Vegas, but don't want to deal with the glitz, glamor and vibe of the strip, I highly recommend The Signature.  It's only a block away, even as long as the blocks in Vegas are, from the strip, but really puts your mind at ease since there is no casino or smoking within the hotel itself.  If you just can't stand being away from the "ching and bling" of the casinos, you're only a hop skip and a jump from the MGM Grand by way of indoor walkway.    Each room is a suite, either studio, one bedroom or two bedroom.  They all come with kitchen or kitchenette, jacuzzi tub and separate shower.  Really nice amenities although you have to contact housekeeping to have kitchen essentials delivered (pots, pans, plates, glasses and silverware).  Not long of a wait though.    Although it's not a standard Vegas hotel, they have various standard Vegas amenities.  Front of house valet, bellman, front desk, room service etc.  The valet attendants are all very personable and helpful and offer cold bottles of water to guests.  There are three towers each with it's own separate front desk and set of elevators.  That's very helpful with coming and going without delay.    Our room itself was on the 19th floor facing southwest.  We caught a glimpse of one of the pools within the MGM Grand as well as the airport.  Nothing too special in that regard.  However, the amenities in the room were wonderful.  We had a full kitchen with full sized fridge and freezer.  That came in handy as we stayed here for almost a full week and would have gone to the poor house if we had to eat out each and every day/ night.  The living room area had a table for four, pull out sofa bed, lounge chair and ottoman and TV with DVD player and game console.  There was also a 3/4 bath in adjacent to the living room.  The bedroom had a king sized bed, work station, pop up TV out of the work station and another chaise lounge chair.  Master bath has the jacuzzi tub, separate shower and two sinks.    Rooms were clean and well kept, but most of all SPACIOUS!    Overall a great stay at The Signature for a rate comparable to that of a basic room on the strip.    Keep on Yelp'n!

Quite the ordeal. This subway is located in the heart of downtown Phoenix.  You'd think they would thrive on having so much business.  Unfortunately it appears they don't want your business.    I was in Phoenix for a convention last weekend.  There was a group at the convention that ordered over 100 boxed lunches for their group from here.  Some friends went into the location soon after that big order was finished and they were told the store "ran out of bread" and they should go down the street to another subway to get sandwiches.  WTH?  Really?  They were making bread and it would have taken about 20 more minutes to finish baking.  Turning away customers because you're out of bread...?    I had a colleague who worked with another fast food chain.  If that situation ever arose for them, they were on the phone well ahead of time to other local stores to see if they could buy bread to get them through the rush.  Wouldn't that have been a smart idea?  Or how about getting the bread into the oven sooner so you didn't run out in the first place?!?!  Anyway, the next day I needed to get something for my kids that was quick and reasonable that they hadn't had the previous two days.  I decided to give this subway a try since it was after their lunch rush but well before any possible dinner rush.  I called ahead knowing I would need to walk down the block hoping for a quick stop and back up to the convention.  When I called, the person sounded rushed and put me on hold.  I started walking out of the hotel and down the street.  When they came back to the phone, I asked about placing an order to be picked up.  The person replied that they had a long line and asked that I call back in 10 minutes.  No problem.  I understand how busy this place was since I had seen the mass o' boxed lunches this other group had gotten.  I walked down the street in less than a minute.  When I walked into the restaurant, there were three customers completing their transaction at the register, but NO LINE whatsoever!  So, how is it that I was told there was a long line of customers and I should call back in 10 minutes?  I asked the clerk behind the counter the same question.  He said there were a bunch of people in there minutes ago.  I asked just two minutes ago?  I had called and there were so many people, I was asked to call back!  He replied by saying, "if you don't believe me, that's on you".    Whatever...  So I placed my order and was out of there in a few minutes.  As I paid and was awaiting my change, the clerk said, "here is your receipt", and turned and walked away.  Normally I would expect something like, "Thanks for coming" or "Come back again".  Something, but I got nothing!  Such a poorly managed place!  Keep on Yelp'n!

We stopped in here for a snack before heading to dinner.  They offer a variety of sweets including gelato and macaroons as well as a number of different crepes, sandwiches, coffees and pastries.  It was actually dinner time, but we had planned on just snacks and dinner afterward.  I was tempted to get a crepe since I was pretty darn hungry, but decided to just grab gelato instead.  I ordered good 'ol fashioned chocolate.  It really hit the spot, creamy smooth.  Kids and my wife had a variety of flavors including mango sorbet, raspberry sorbet, coconut and vanilla.  There's plenty of space to roam and look at other options on display as well as a few tables just outside the actual restaurant.   Service was quick and friendly.  The cashier had some very good suggestions.  My daughter was just hoping to get three small scoops, since she eats like a bird anyway.  However, the server didn't tell my daughter that three scoops was going to be GINORMOUS!  Prices are fairly reasonable for Caesars.  There was also a convenient bar right outside with TVs, video poker and charging stations under the bar itself, which came in very handy.  Both are located right outside the Bacchanal buffet inside Caesar's Palace.    If you find yourself wandering inside the casino in need of a quick snack or something sweet, this is a great spot to stop into!  Keep on Yelp'n!

AH, Sin City!  What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas...  unless you use Yelp!  Then you gotta write a review!    It had been a while since my last visit to this fun town.  Almost too long.  We had reason as my daughter's dance team was scheduled to compete here over the July 4th weekend.  Yes, it was hot.  It was even over 100 and climbing as we drove through the desert at sunset to get there.  Well, this visit did not disappoint.  Aside from the dance competition, there were some new attractions and hotels that had sprung up since my last visit as well as the need to visit some oldies but goodies.  The Aria and Cosmopolitan hotels were new near the center of the strip.  Not necessarily new this year, but new since the last time I visited.  I'm pretty sure they were in the process of being built, but can't say for sure. Anyway, those are two newer hotels that are conjoined by a nice high end mall.    The lights along the strip are stunning.  Huge billboards that are super clear and crisp line most every hotel.  I wish I had something like that in my living room to watch ball games on!  Must say, the girls on the strip seem to a bit more visible and aggressive than what I remember in trips past.    All in all, good times in Vegas this time around!  Keep on Yelp'n!

If you LOVE food, this is the place to be.  Vegas is known for a variety of things including gambling, shows and food.  The Bacchanal has a little bit of everything for foodies far and wide!  I first visited this buffet years ago back in my college days.  A group of friends and I were in town for spring break and thought it would be fun to splurge on a meal before heading back to school.  This was a whole new experience to say the least.    The location has moved from what I recall.  Used to be just outside of the sports book, but now is a bit further back (or forward depending on how you look at the casino).  Various sections include seafood, meat, hispanic, italian and asian.  Can't forget the all important dessert section since it's one of the first you see when you arrive.    I'lll try to recall as many of the details as possible since my phone died just as we entered and couldn't take photos of the sections of delectable treats.  At the seafood station, there were chilled crab legs, shrimp, lobster claws, ceviche, baked clams, steamed muscles and other wonderful creations. I don't know how many pounds of seafood we ate, but must have been a few platefuls.  The meat section had prime rib, ribs, sausages, turkey, lamb chops and others.  There's also good 'ol american sliders if you're feeling like going basic.  I know there was more, but my eyes were locked in on the prime rib.  Italian had pasta, pizza and steamed crab legs.  I skipped the latin section simply because I ran out of room.  The sushi near the back was simply wonderful and I believe the oysters were located near this section as well.  You could order your favorite asian noodle dish along with a wide variety of dumplings and other asian dishes.  I also made sure to get a couple mini salads to balance all the gluttony.  I actually didn't dive into the desserts since I literally couldn't move for a while after finishing my last plate.  But some of the desserts that came back with others included creme brulee, pistachio cake, fruit tartes, red velvet cup cakes and gelato.    We sat and enjoyed family for a while before heading out.  The one drawback I encountered was that they overcharged me for our group.  I had three adults and two children.  I'm bummed that they charged my 13 year old daughter the adult (holiday price even more) price since she eats like a bird.  They also charged my 9 year old the same adult price when it should have been the children's price.  The cashier had said it had been a long day, but yikes!  While there are quite a few delectable treats here, I can't agree with that mistake!  Yes, I should have checked my receipt before leaving the cashier, but thought I explained the ages of my children well enough not to have to especially after she confirmed the ages.  Over all a great dining experience.  Be sure to wear the stretchy pants and leave plenty of time before and after you plan on eating.  The lines can be daunting prior to entering and you'll need to muster up energy after gorging yourself.  In the future I'll try to avoid a holiday weekend to avoid the price increase and cashier lag.  Keep on Yelp'n!
