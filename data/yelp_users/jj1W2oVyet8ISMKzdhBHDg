What happened here? This used to be a place that you could go into and get a fine meal and out within an hour. A month ago I was there for a business lunch and it took a total of 2 hours for 4 people. They kept loosing our order they told us. The manager comped most of the meal for us.  Today I stopped in and this time had to nearly hog tie the waiter to take our beverage order. Once he got there we ordered our food items for fear he would never return. About an hour later our food finally arrived. The food is great but the side salad was a disappointment.  BIDWELL FAMILY: Now that you own this historic restaurant, stop by and check out the poor service that you are offering.

My 2nd experience with this restaurant yesterday was NOT positive! A few weeks ago we heard that Don Jose's had reopened so my daughter & I went running over to try it out. The salsa was just as good as it was before but the cheese enchiladas were disappointing. The original Don Jose's cheese enchiladas were the BEST in the Valley. When I ordered a Togo for my husband I was told that they weren't doing "To Go's" yet and I would have to put it in the Styrofoam Togo box MYSELF. Yikes! The owner maybe didn't think that there was a liability to his customers by doing that themselves as the plates were steaming hot and I could have burned myself! I scooped the food from the STEAMING plate being very careful not to burn myself. BAD IDEA!   And then there was yesterday. We attempted to go again with some friends of the family. We all "grew up" with Don Jose (including my Mom who ate there once a week when she worked at Anita's back in the day) and thought this would be a great restaurant to meet at. My sister, daughter & I were 45 minutes early to the restaurant . To our SHOCK the owner would not allow us to be seated because our "party" was not all there. There would be 7 of us and he would not hear of it! Hum...there were two big tables sitting there empty. I told the owner that were were tired (just having finished the Willo Home Tour in downtown Phoenix and saving our appetite for Don Jose's) and would be ordering our drinks and a cheese crisp to hold us over until the rest of the girls came. Nope...would not let us be seated and were told "that we had to think of him!"   We then went outside and called the rest of our party and told them that the NEW OWNER would not let us sit down 45 minutes early so we would be going to "Manuel's" on 28th Street & Indian School to meet. There we WERE SEATED, spent $85 for the 7 of us PLUS $20 for additional takeout. Sorry NEW OWNER...you missed out on our patronage yesterday and forever! That negative voice and attitude better change because negative publicity travels quickly and in these challenging economic times that is financial suicide... no matter how you try to imatate something that can NOT be reinvented!   Take it from a "wise Latina" your customers ALWAYS come first!

DO NOT TRY THE BLACK BEAN TORTILLAS!  Horrible! Service was the best thing about this restaurant.  I was very disappointed as I have been wanting to eat here for years. Again, disappointing...

OMG! Just tried this restaurant for the first time. Tuesdays are $2 tacos. I tried the fish tacos and they were definitely the BEST in the Valley!  I also asked for a "cup" of Fideo Soup. When they brought it to me I corrected them that I had requested a "cup." The waiter replied, "This IS our "cup!' It was a BOWL!  When I tasted it, tears came to my eyes as it tasted just like my Mom made it . Being Hispanic and eating true Mexican food is a joy where you want to return over and over again.   Rossana G.  P.S. The mojitos were wonderful! YUMMY!

Well, don't order the fried chicken nor the mashed potatoes nor the cherry pie Ala mode. Really disappointed tonight. Their breakfasts have always been so good so I guess I will just stick to that.

I have been subscribing now for a few months and have been completely delighted with the produce that has been delivered. This morning along with my normal order was the homemade pecan cinnamon bread that I ordered.  This was also a great treat! Highly recommend ordering your fruit and veggies from Nature's Garden!

BEWARE! Before going to these doctors MAKE them give you an estimated cost for their in-house stress test and tell them that is what you will be paying and not a cent more! Their in-house stress tests are $4,000+. It is a shocker after your have paid your deductible and your insurance company has paid their portion only to find out you STILL owe another $350! I purposely did not pay the bill until I had to. I attempted to negotiate it down but they do not negotiate. Money or collections. I then asked the supervisor to remove me as a patient and she didn't care. I then told her this is why the Democrats want Universal Health-care! The doctors have driven up their costs to crazy rates because the insurance company's are fed up with them charging so much. Then to top things off, the doctors spend all of 5 minutes with you, talk too fast and never discuss the cost of any of their procedures or tests. They leave that difficult task for their underpaid staff to deal with the patients. What a life!  Find another group and ask lots of questions upfront. That was my mistake!

The 2 stars are for the decor only.  The food was not good! We will stick with Gadzooks across the street!

Oh my! Being Hispanic, I hold these types of restaurants to a higher standard and this restaurant surpassed all other taco venders in the valley! From the perfectly spiced salsa and homemade chips to the fish and tasty carne asada tacos, it was simply amazing! We also tried the corn which we asked to be taken off of the husk and served as a side, was mouth watering at the very least. This has to be my new favorite restaurant. Simple menu but packed with fabulous choices. Great job Michael!
