Sadly, the George and Dragon isn't what it used to be. For years I've come here for the British food but I guess I'll have to find somewhere else.   The Steak & Mushroom Pie, Chicken and Mushroom Pie, and Steak and Kidney Pie have been discontinued, but are still shown on the menu on the website - very disappointing.  I chose the Shepherd's Pie instead which was actually pretty good.  My wife ordered the "George and Dragon's Famous Fish and Chips". They were inedible - overcooked to death and hard as a rock.  The coleslaw was warm.  The only thing edible on her plate were the chips (french fries).  Such a disappointment,

Food, Service, and Ambiance that lives up to the Wrigley name.  It's been a good year and it was time to celebrate.  There are many expensive restaurants in the Phoenix area, but none with a history as rich as 'Wrigley'.  I'm a gourmet chef and so I'm pretty tough on restaurants - the food has to be better than I can prepare at home. The Wrigley Mansion Club exceeded that standard with no problem.  The quality and presentation of the food were excellent. The service was impeccable.  And as for ambiance, we were seated in the Mansion's formal dining room; what more can I say.

Tony's.  I'm salivating just thinking about the place.  I'm a gourmet chef and so I can be picky about my ingredients. When I want Pancetta or Prosciutto I get it from Tony's.   He slices it to whatever thickness I need.  And when Mama looks at me with that twinkle in her eye and says, "I made fresh cannoli..." I can't resist. Nestled back in one of the frozen food cases is the most wonderful pasta sauce; I keep some on hand for a quick meal.  And it's not just the food items. Walking in to Tony's takes me back to the days when I lived and worked all over Europe and bought many a meal in little shops just like it.

My wife and I have been driving by Joey's for two years and last Saturday evening we were in the mood to try someplace new.  I'm always up for trying a new restaurant.  The Adventure! The Curiosity! The excitement!  Oh, lets not get to carried away here.  I'm a pretty decent self-taught chef and my standard is simple: The food had better be at least as good as I can prepare at home.  I had the Rigatoni with smoked chicken in a parmesan cream sauce.  This is a dish that's hard to screw up, and they didn't.  It was fine. But 15 bucks?  We're talking about a few cents worth of pasta, some cream and parmesan, and about a quarter of a chicken breast grilled and tossed in. Easy. Tasty. Not worth $15 hard-earned money. We're talking the same price as Macaroni Grill's Chicken Scaloppine and there is a world of difference between what went in to the two dishes.  My wife had the lasagna. She ate a small portion and asked for a cary-out container.  As we were walking to the car later she said, "The lasagna was terrible".  So why did she want to take it home?  "I dunno".  At least that gave our son a chance to render a second opinion on it.  Our son, the Army Infantry Fire Team Leader. Chows down MRE's like they are gourmet.  His verdict?  "Disgusting"  If you are going to spend fifty bucks on a meal you deserve better than this.

I just got home from buying an Acura RDX from Acura of Tempe.  I have to say this was the most pleasant and painless car-buying experience of my entire life.  No hassle.  No pressure.  Gave me more for my trade-in than I expected. Gave me a better deal on the new car than I expected.  Everyone was absolutely super.

These guys have been around forever, they care about the long-term relationship.  My first experience with Qualtire was almost 30 years ago (They have been at the same location since the 1960's)  when my father needed some sewer line work.  It was going to be expensive, but they worked with him to make it affordable by showing him exactly where to dig so he could to the digging himself.  Once the digging was done they came back and did the plumbing part. That saved my Dad a lot of money.   Whenever I need plumbing thy are the only people I call.

Anzio's has been my go-to spot for Italian for many years. Great food. Reasonable prices.  Nobody makes a better pizza.  Everyone that I've introduced to Anzio's pizza is now a fan.  Anzio's lasagna is the only lasagna that is better than mine. I love their salads.  They are simple but are chilled.  Nobody within miles of this place is nearly as good.

To find a deli that makes their own bread is tough.  To find one who's bread is good enough to write home about is an achievement.  I wouldn't call myself a bread connoisseur, but as a passionate breadmaker I am tough customer. These guys make outstanding bread.  Tender crust (I dislike thick tough crust), great mouth feel, and that classic aroma of fresh artisan bread.  They also have fresh WHOLE-Milk mozzarella which is something of a rarity.  Decent selection of meats and cheeses.  Absolutely fantastic staff.

I'm a chef.  My standard for dining out is that the food must be better than I can prepare myself. Greektown meets that standard with ease.  The Mousaka is the best on the planet. I recently brought a Greek colleague to Greektown and after the first bite of Mousaka she said, "OMG this is better than Dad's!" The fried calimari rings are the best I've ever had.  George, the owner, is full of life and enthusiasm and banter.  Half the fun of going to Greektown is interacting with George.  This place is my go-to spot for business lunch meetings in the central corridor. The booths are large and offer privacy, and the place is quiet enough for conversation.  And Greektown serves the best Greek food in the valley.  I don't go anywhere else.

This is a really difficult review for me to write. I've eaten here on two previous occasions. I love the decor.  The staff is friendly. The Shepard's Pie is extraordinarily good.  On today's visit I asked why Bangers and Mash is not on the menu.  The waitress said that while it is not on the menu it is available and I could order it.  I did so. Mistake.  I've lived in Britain, home of bangers and mash.  I've eaten many a banger. Bangers are a plump  sausage, typically made with a particular type of breadcrumbs called 'rusk' and they have a very distinctive flavor.  Go to Wikipedia, search for "bangers and mash" to see a typical photo.  The bangers on my plate today looked NOTHING like bangers.  Small, scrawny things that tasted rather like frankfurter. they were also a reddish color of frankfurter rather than the rich dark brown that a banger should be.  If you go to Skeptical Chymist I heartily recommend the Shepard's Pie.  Skip the Bangers and Mash however.

I am very impressed with Blue Sky Pest Control - far more than with any of the other firms I've used over the years.  My house is five years old and so it was time to have it re-treated for termites. I called Blue SKy for that and at the same signed up for a year of bi-monthly pest control treatments.  I'v now had my third interaction with Blue Sky techs and I am very pleased. They are knowledgable, friendly, and responsive.    Even my wife made the same comment.  She is the one who had most of the interactions with the previous pest control firms and made the same comment that Blue Sky seems to be a heck of a lot better than any of the others.

When it comes to cigars I consider myself a newbie.  A long long time ago I used to enjoy Royal Jamaica cigars frequently but then fell away from the cigar-smoking hobby.  In the intervening years the Jamaican cigar industry was wiped out by a hurricane.  I recently started smoking cigars again.  Knowing that Royal Jamaica was no longer around, I visited Goodfellas - they are just a couple of miles from my house.  They helped me pick out three cigars as a starting point.  I've been back many times. I consider them my Tour Guides of the Cigar World.  They helped me discover my preferences, and now that they know my preferences (and the fact that I'm receptive to trying new cigars) their recommendations have been great.  The place is staffed with great people who are down-to-earth decent human being and genuine cigar lovers.  I love this place.  UPDATE: Goodfellas is now closed.

They moved my parent several years ago.  I was so impressed with them that I called them to help me with my move. Flexible, great service reasonable prices.  Took great care with my furniture and belongings.  Would enthusiastically recommend them.

As a gourmet chef, I'm tough on restaurants.  The food has to be better than I can prepare at home, so take that into account when you read this review.  I had a lunch appointment, and my colleague suggested this place.  I arrived a few minutes before 12:00 and there were just two other tables occupied.  Bad Sign. My colleague arrived and as I was perusing the lunch menu , I picked out a pasta item that was reasonably-priced at $8.95 The ?owner? walked by and mentioned that they had a special that was not on the menu: linguine with olive oil, garlic, and shrimp. He neglected to mention the price (Bad Sign Number 2).   I'm always leery of lunch specials that are not on the menu.  Too many times they consist of items left over from the night before.  I decided to order it any way.  It arrived and it was a disappointment. The pasta was undercooked and the shrimp was over cooked.  Worse yet, when the bill arrived I discovered that the charge for this dish too awful to finish was 24 dollars!  I understand that the restaurant business is tough and they have to make a living, but a dollar's worth of poorly-cooked ingredients is not worth $24.

Ok, I admit: I'm really hard on restaurants, but my standard is simple: The food has to be better than what I can prepare at home.  Sweet Lady Wife and I went to Amante tonight.  I ordered Mix Seafood Penne.  Here's the description on the menu: "King crab meat, shrimp, chopped garlic, lobster sauce, pepper, garnished with asparagus & parmesan cheese"  The dish I was served bore little resemblance to that description: penne pasta, run-of-the-mill creme sauce, some asparagus spears and three - count 'em: three - shrimp.  The decor was beautiful.  I wish the food lived up to it.

I just finished the 24-week Practical Series and without a doubt it was well worth the time and money. I consider myself a pretty decent home chef, but I wanted to take my skills up a level.  Classic Cooking Academy did exactly that.  I look at recipes entirely differently now.  I no longer view them as instructions.  I view them and a source of ideas or inspiration.  One example, I was reviewing a recipe for pork tenderloin cordon bleu and got to the part containing the steps for making the sauce.  I said, "I see what they are doing here, they are making a cream sauce.  But they forgot the shallots.  And since it goes on pork it should probably also have some rosemary."  Thanks to Classic Cooking Academy I now think like that.  What you will learn in the Practical Series is methods and techniques. You learn the building blocks. You learn about sautéing meat vs sautéing vegetables.  You will gain confidence in the kitchen.  Even me, who has been cooking for ten years and consider myself an experienced home chef, I now find myself much more relaxed in the kitchen.  Dishes I've been preparing for years now seem so much easier.  Each session has a classroom portion at the beginning in which Chef Pascal demonstrates the technique and also explains the WHY behind it.  Then you move to the kitchen for a hands-on session.  Chef Pascal is the perfect person to be teaching this course. A passion for food.  A great sense of humor. A life of experience working in kitchens in Europe and America.  I don't care if you've never cooked a meal in or life, or if you are more experienced.  You will find Classic Cooking Academy's Practical Series well worth it.  In fact, I've already signed up for their 12-week Pastry Series.

This is not your ordinary perfume shop.  My wife has not been able to wear perfume in many years because they aggravate her allergies.  Paula, a highly skilled perfumer explained why: Most department store-grade perfumes are a lot of alcohol and chemicals and very little of the essence that makes them perfumes.  All of their products are high-quality, mostly from Europe (and surprisingly not that expensive).  Paula spent the better part of an hour with my Sweet Lady Wife on a journey to find her 'signature scent'. (BTW, none of the perfumes aggravated her allergies).  When my wife had found a couple scents that she liked, Paula urged her to go for a short walk, come back and re-evaluate.  We learned that the heat of your body and contact with your skin changes the scent, so that while you may like it coming out of the bottle, you may not like it after you've been wearing it for a while.  Paula understands this and makes it part of the buying process.  By the time we were done, my wife was very happy - she ad a perfume that she liked, did not bother her allergies, and was distinctively different than the stuff found in department stores.  Ladies, I urge you to visit them.  Men, I urge you to bring your wives. You can have a scent that is unique and unlike what thers are wearing, and do so via a very enjoyable process that was akin to participating in a wine tasting.

I think this is going to be my go-to spot for breakfast,  A friend who is a semi-regular at Vovomeena and I had a breakfast meeting there at his suggestion. I had the Banging Pocket and loved it.  The food was delivered quickly and the service was attentive.

I was driving up 7th Street yesterday when I spied an old friend: Waldo's BBQ. I used to spend a lot of time in Mesa and ate at Waldo's Mesa location often. Discovering a Waldo's within 10 minutes of my house was as if the food gods were smiling down on me.  Waldo's Pig-N-Out location is set up a little different than their Mesa location: Pig-N-Out caters to the take-out and drive-through crowd. I ordered the Pig Sandwich and Cole Slaw. The bill was a measly four bucks. Granted, the size of the sandwich was a little smaller than the super-sized portions that ordinary fast food joints are pushing. If you have a big appetite you may want to order two.  For me (and my wife as well) the sandwich and slaw made a perfectly-sized meal.  And it was 4 bucks!  Waldo's uses their own unique sauce.  It's different from most BBQ joints.  My wife raved about the flavor and the fact that the sauce is served on the side so you can put on as much or little as you want.  If you like BBQ I strongly suggest you try Waldo's for their unique flavor.  I know that I'm going to be visiting Waldos very frequently.

These guys are good.  No, they are not just good, they are fantastic.  I'm about to trade in my old car and so I wanted to make it look as good as possible.  They came out to my house and frankly, the car looks brand new.    They now have my business for life.

I am a gourmet chef, and I am tough on restaurants.  I do however have a weakness for little 'hole-in-the-wall' joints where the cooks are passionate about the food they put out and the staff is friendly. This is a place worth my repeat business.  Sammiches just opened in this little strip mall a few blocks from my house. My wife had the Steak and Onion sandwich.  I had the Cuban.  They were both excellent and the prices are VERY reasonable.   We also shared an order of fries. Many times, a restaurant will put out a great main product but them skimp on the sides.  Well, I don't know if they make their own fries or not but they were great fries.  I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing that they are so close to home because I will be eating there a lot.
