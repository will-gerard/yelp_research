hubby's from Chicago, so its not too often I get to go have a slice of delicious thin-crusted NY style pizza...so this was a treat, and a really great one at that!  The service was friendly, the pizza DELICIOUS, the atmosphere very "New York-y".  The price, fine with me.  This pizza was better than the pizza I had in New York just a month ago.  Even my Chicago style devotee hubbs admitted to enjoying the leftovers I brought him :)

My favorite places are the "hole in the wall" types, and I've never been a super-stickler about cleanliness of it is just stuff like the tables aren't wiped down fast enough, but over the years Mokis has gotten dirtier and dirtier and its gotten to the point that I'm concerned about food safety. This place used to be a favorite. We especially loved the kalua pork and the lau lau. The potato mac was something I always looked forward too, but unfortunately the last 2 times we visited it just was not good. The Kalua pork wasn't bad, but the lau lau had less than a teaspoon of protein in it, and I'm using the word protein because I couldn't identify what it was. It tasted, felt, and looked like it was just a peice of fat and there were no signs of anything else in the leaf. The potatomac salad was more mayonnaise-y than usual, but it was two times in a row and a few weeks apart, so not likely to be"just an off day." Our teriyaki beef was burned the last time we had it and the portion size was smaller than we had received on other visits when our children ordered kids plates. Pretty disappointed. We'd love to come back, but the last 2 visits and the decline in sanitation make that decision one that we'we not quite ready to make.

LOVE this restaurant.  Its my favorite place to go for date night with hubs.  The food is so flavorful and seemingly fresh.  Service is always quick, and if not friendly, certainly not rude in any way.   My favorite things to order are the Spicy Eggplant and the Pra Ram, together.  You get a savory and spicy eggplant dish and a slightly sweet and spicy peanut sauce dish and the combo is excellent. (its not served as a combo, but my husband will order one, and I the other and we share.)  We get out of this restaurant filled, happy, and wallets still full.  Dinner for 2 is easily done for under $25 bucks, even with a 20% tip!  The only drawback to this restaurant is that we could never take a large party there.  This tiny little restaurant only seats about a dozen maybe a dozen and a half people. but they offer take out!

Seriously outdated facilities, nothing "luxury" or "five-star" about it.  Thread-bare towels, decidedly un-luxurious sheets and pillows.  Decor, OK, but not luxury or "five-star", even in a different era. No wifi, unless you want to go to the lobby? No HBO, Showtime, or even the standard overpriced pay-per-view hotel movie fare?  Also, if by chance your stay is not meeting your expectations, every little section of operation is essentially fire-walled off from each other so that nobody can help you, unless of course you consider a "concierge" (who does less than the front desk of a motel 6) dialing a phone number and handing you the phone without even telling you who you're talking too, or what department she's dialed "help."  And honestly, the staff here at Cibola Vista look like they hate their jobs, and they probably do.  Which probably accounts for the poor service.  Lastly, 15 to 20 year old magazine covers which purportedly brag on the wonders of the Blue Green Vacation organization don't impress me.  Yelp reviews do.  If you like time-travel, and your preferred destination is, as one other yelper said "a resort with ammenities" set in the mid 90's....go for it. If you're looking for something more current with better amenities, we recently had a lovely stay at a Hampton Inn.  I think I shall do them the benefit of a positive yelp.

The best place on the planet for Santa Pictures each year.  My kids love visiting this place, and I love that they are always welcomed here.  Its the kind of place that makes me feel on edge as a parent because my kids can't resist the idea of making a run for it and doing something obnoxious like jumping on the ATV's, climbing inside a display tent, or "riding" a pillow fish...but never once have they gotten a sideways glance from a Bass pro employee.  It would seem that even at their most obnoxious, they are welcome here.   I like to tease that the displays are a "zombie zoo" which makes my kids say "maaaawaaaaaaaaaam....they're not even real, and zombies aren't even real either"....I have to allow my son to believe that the displays are made of plastic and fake fur or he'll cry.  Whatever. To each their own.  Its a fun family outing.

LOVED Pita Jungle. Very Fresh, Very delicious, Very affordable.  We tried the beef gyros, the falafel pita, a kids plate, and a piece of carrot cake.    The Beef Gyro had a pickle on it, which we thought was strange, but it WORKED, YUM!  It was on a nice soft flat bread with beautiful greens topping it.  The Falafel was on a toasted/almost crispy pita and was flavorful as can be.  Also with beautiful greens and a delicious tahini based sauce.  the kids plate was amazing, no blue boxed stuff here...delicious tangy grilled lemon chicken, homemade mac'n'cheese, really green, fresh beautiful broccoli, and a side of fresh fruit with a drink for $4.95  The Carrot cake=moist and delicious, but I probably would leave the caramel sauce off. It actually worked with the cake, but was a little too sweet for my tastes.    The service was a teensy bit slow, but it was very busy today, probably because of the extensive vegetarian list and Ash Wednesday being the day of our vist. But that said, the service was also attentive and friendly.  Decor was fun and funky, very bohemian, so were the staff there.  Loved it.

When have you ever visited an establishment who's greeting to you is "Thank you for bringing your nice family"  LOVE  This is noodle soup served with love.  Its also the only place we've ever eaten Pho, so I don't feel qualified to comment on the authenticity of the food, but it tastes so good, so fresh, so delicious, that even if it were not authentic, I would still give it 5 stars.  The last trip we made was an incredibly hot day, I ordered a lime soda (soda water and an abundance of fresh squeezed lime juice, with a lime wedge and ice....so refreshing!) with one of the salads...rice vermicelli with shrimp sausage.  Absolutely perfect for a hot day.  I enjoyed immensely.  Also, at the end of our meal, the owner came walking in and whether he actually recognized us or not, I have no idea (we've only been 2 or 3 times before) but he ACTED like he knew us and came walking up and again greeted us with "Thank you for bringing your family today".  Gotta love it.

my favorite place for a sub sandwich.  Like other reviewers said, nothing fancy here, just a good sandwich on good bread.  Call me crazy, but I think its the shredded lettuce that makes them so darn good!    Faves:  BLT, a very generous serving of bacon that's actually crispy.  Don't skip the mayo, its worth every calorie to make it the very best.  Poor Boy:  Was my fave until I tried the BLT.  Nothing fancy, just delicious, with a generous serving of meat.  Kids Fave: Pizza Boat.    Other: PEPSI products! Yeah! Well, I don't care, but since my husband's blood is most likely 90% Diet Pepsi by now, its a plus..  Always appears clean, food always delicious, service always friendly.  We eat here somewhere near once a month, have been to a "competitor" (really, its silly to call that place Jared likes to eat a competitor, because they really aren't the same kinds of businesses at all) once in the last year, and remembered after one bite why we always choose Steve's for a sandwich.

Yuck pretty much covers it.    There is a serious diconnect between atmosphere and food here.  If Tia Rosa put as much thought into the quality of their food and the authenticity of their recipes (or at least call it what it is...which is to say *Not* Mexican) as they do into their decor, they might really have something.  until then, if you want to eat someplace cute, enjoy! if you want to eat someplace good, try something else.  (I didn't finish my fish taco here...I am kinda famous for cleaning my plate, even if I'm not that into it...does that tell you how much I didn't like it?)

Steamed buns fresh and delicious. Service friendly, sweets good. We enjoyed very much...but I almost don't feel qualified to say how good a bakery it is because this was my first experience with a non-european  bakery.  All I know is we've gone back on multiple occasions to buy the steamed buns and they are always delicious. BTW, we drive about 15 miles out of our way to get them, so, yeah, one could say we like them, ALOT.

we used Moore and Son's carpet cleaning in June of this year.  Gary arrived on time, honored the price he quoted us, even after some stains proved more work to remove than he planned for.  We also had him clean our couch and were THRILLED with the results.  In addition, he gave us great tips on how to avoid those kinds of stains in the future (ie: don't use store bought carpet stain removers, just stick with good ol' vinegar, or clear water so the soap doesn't stick in the fibers and become like a magnet for further stain development.)

After visiting this place shortly after its opening, I decided despite my major disappointment to cut them a break, and not post a yelp review. However, after visiting two other self-serve yogurt shops in the valley, I am completely convinced that I will not return. -The experience- not sure what kind of business opens its doors to the public but makes it impossible for them to park directly in front of the store by blocking off the first 4 parking spots available with tacky lawn furniture, a bed sheet, and hand made signs that said no parking, but this was what I was greeted with. (and yet I still went inside...somebody slap me now...the writing was literally on a rope).  I am assuming the owners were the adult couple fidgeting with the lawn furniture and flitting around the store.  They weren't friendly, they never once cracked a smile, never made eye contact with their customers (there were at least three groups of people having yogurt, and based on overhearing the register totals, they had cleared over $100 in yogurt sales in just under 15 minutes...that would make ME smile! but I guess I'm not over invested in a giant yogurt shop) The store was fairly well littered with multi-level marketing type product, business cards, etc, all with the same name on it...the owners?  Not sure, but my experience there felt like I had walked into a den of desperation. -The Yogurt- eh.  I didn't care for it.  But lets face it, taste is subjective.  Not sure what Yogurt Kingdom claims, but based on the overly sweet, muddled flavors, I am guessing that the yogurt flavors are not 100% natural.   -The Price- well, .39 cents an ounce seems to be the going rate for self-serve yogurt, so they are priced within the range of their competition.  That said, I find it extraordinarily interesting that I have been able to twice now visit other .39 p/oz establishments with a party of 4 with the same serve yourself rules set out by me-mom before serving ourselves and spent less than $1.00 more than the amount I paid for just 2 servings at Yogurt Kingdom.  Somethings not right.  I would like to assume that an error was made on the part of the cashier and that there is not dishonesty involved.- -The sum total of it all- there's tastier yogurt in town with friendlier people and no MLM junk who actually want you to park in front of their store and make them look busy.

I'll admit, I was a little nervous to do strip mall Chinese in AJ but I wanted Chinese, and the reviews were good, so we went for it. We will definitely go back.  The egg foo yung was delicious, not greasy at all. My husband ordered the cashew almond chicken, the veggies in it were still crisp, the nuts were crunchy, and the sauce very good. We normally order spicy dishes when we get chinese, but tonight we were in the mood for mild. These dishes hit the spot with delicious savory sauces. Comfort food, I guess. I'll look forward to returning to try other favorites soon. Or maybe find out what the piled high plate of giant shrimp and veggies was we saw being delivered to a nearby table and try that! Those shrimp were huge!  P.s. service was great tonight, very attentive. Our glasses were kept full and our daughters special food request was happily met.

Had high hopes, but after waiting 40 minutes I no longer had time for the manicure and pedicure I would have liked to have had. Oh well. Really disappointed. I don't know if it's a good sign of the work they would do, or a bad sign of service, but they did not even look up when I got up out of the chair I had been assigned and left. It's hard for me to find an hour+ for myself during business hours, I'm pretty bummed I spent most of it waiting and left without service. I guess bad on me for not having an appointment. If I go back and have a better wait time, I will edit .
