The only reason I'm not giving just one star is because our server did try hard to make our experience a good one. Unfortunately, our food took forever, it was cold, my eggs were overdone... AND we were sitting where I could see right into the kitchen. This allowed me to see another server drop toast on the floor, then pick it up, put it on a plate and serve it to the people behind us. I'm not sure if my upset stomach is my mindset or bad food. We should've gone to TJ's. Won't make that mistake again.

Boy, am I ever glad we showed up AFTER the new management took over. Looking at past reviews is saddening considering the fantastic experience my family had at Lovejoy's.   Ours was a totally impromptu visit. We were out car shopping when the kids started in with the "I'm STARVING" proclamations from the backseat. When we are out and about, my husband and I always try to find new places to eat, so when I spotted Lovejoy's we didn't hesitate to check it out.  The waitress was very friendly and helpful. The food was incredible. We got the Family Feast and the four of us each chose a side. Potato salad, corn bread, BBQ beans and french fries (fries were chosen by our 7 year old. lol)  The meat was melt-in-your-mouth tender. The sides were all very good as well. Even my 7 year old, who may quite possibly be the pickiest person on the entire planet, proclaimed the food as being "delicious"!  We thought the price was more than fair and we took home leftovers that lasted for two more meals!!  Last, but not least, the sauces were very very good! We will definitely be going back for more!

Eric is a great guy. He is helpful and knowledgeable. He always takes the time to talk with customers and seems to truly care about people's stories. Also, if you need something he doesn't have in stock, he goes to great lengths to get it.

In the past, I have dealt with Dr. Ganesh and Dr. MacCollum, both of whom were very good, professional, respectful and courteous. The one star is not for them, but rather for my most recent visits.  My son was seen by Dr. Morris twice for excruciating pain in his feet. She took a set of xrays both times and ordered an MRI the second time. The MRI was a long time coming and I couldn't wait to get the results. Here's where the one star part comes in. I received a call from Dr. Morris' assistant who advised they had received the results of his MRI and asked if I would like to schedule an appointment to go over them with Dr. Morris. At this point, I had already figured out what was wrong with my son, but wanted to double check the MRI was negative just to ensure what we thought was the cause was actually the cause. I explained this to the assistant who informed me, "Dr. Morris does not give MRI results over the phone because it is a HIPAA violation." The problem with this is that I work in the healthcare field and I know for a fact this is not true. I ended the call and called back after I had a chance to think about this and asked the front office girl to speak to a supervisor. She advised she would pass my information on to the supervisor but asked what it was regarding. I advised her I would like to talk to the supervisor regarding this incident. Because if it is just the doctor's policy, that's one thing; however, it is not now, nor has it ever been a HIPAA violation to give lab results over the phone. She stated, "Yes it is." I laughed and told her, "Now I really need to talk to your supervisor because, clearly, your office is misinformed and I'm not going to pay another copay or have my insurance pay for another visit just to be told, again, that she doesn't see anything. If your supervisor would like to show me exactly where, in the law, it states this, I'll be glad to come in at that time; however, I am sure this is wrong and if your office is telling people this just to get them in the door again, that's not clinically appropriate."  She advised she would pass my information to the supervisor who would call me back. I received a call from the supervisor who, apparently, has never had training in customer service in her entire life because she was the rudest, most incapable "supervisor" I have ever had the unpleasant experience of speaking to EVER. I answered the phone and she introduced herself and said she was told I would like to speak to her. I told her I had taken my son there and recently had an MRI for which their office has the results. I further stated I had received a call from the assistant who told me he could not give me the results due to HIPAA law. I told her I am not wanting to take time off work, take my son out of school and go all the way down there again when I have already been there three times, for the doctor to scratch her head and tell me she still doesn't know. I advised I think I figured out what the problem is and that if she would just be so kind as to tell me whether she sees something or it's negative, I can go from there. But, I don't want to go there again if there is nothing to discuss.  The supervisor then told me, "Okay, well, first of all, you've only been here twice. (Whatever. Two times, three times, fifty times, that is not the point.) And it is the doctor's policy to go over the results in person." To which I said, 'Okay, if that's the case then that is fine and THAT is what your staff should be telling people because that is not a HIPAA violation. It has nothing to do with HIPAA and..." She interrupted and told me in a rather snotty tone that she had through the entire conversation that SHE will handle that part but, "Do you want to schedule an appointment or not?"  Let me just say this: I said, several times, that if there is something we need to discuss on the MRI in person, I'll gladly go down there, but if there is nothing on it, she can tell me that on the phone and I will continue to pursue the course of action I had felt was necessary. As I was stating this, she interrupted again to tell me that "yelling" at her was not going to do any good. To which I replied, "I'm not yelling. I'm simply talking to you about this situation." She then said, "I guess that's just your voice then." WTF is wrong with you, lady? First of all, I am a customer who is trying to figure out what to do about a situation that you are making more difficult than it needs to be. SECOND, the bottom line is not whether or not I want to take time off or whether or not I pay a copay or whether or not your staff are incompetent. The point is my son is in pain every single day. He is ten years old and up until four months ago, he was fine. And you can let your incompetent doctor know it was a medication side effect she should have caught. Also, the results were sent to another doc as well who gave me the results ON THE PHONE.

So disappointing. Not only did the service take forever, the meat was dry, the corn was dry, the buns were dry. It's unfortunate. Last time we were here, it was great. Not sure what happened, but we won't be back.

The hostess is rude and grumpy, greeting people with a frown, seemingly hating life. She unceremoniously informed me it's a 45 minute wait for two people. I walked into the bar area where there were approximately twenty empty seats at the bar alone, not to mention the twenty empty seats along a half-wall next to the bar. I asked grumpy face if it's self-seating in the bar. Without looking up and in a irritated tone, she said, "Same seating. Same wait." I then told her to cross my name off the list. I find my husband to let him know about what happened. We walked past the bar to leave just as people walked up and sat down without being seated...and they ordered. I've been here once before and the food is mediocre at best. Everyone seems to hate working there. I'll stop at the farmer's market for honey and preserves, but I'll never go to the cafe again and will be sure to let others know as well.

My husband, my friends and I LOVE Roman's. Not only are the staff just good, down to Earth people, but the crowd is nothing if not entertaining. We always have a great time! The ONLY downfall is that it's a cash only bar.

BEST restaraunt experience I've had in a long time. The food is FANTASTIC. The servings are HUGE and enough for two meals. Service was great and we were absolutely shocked to see how cheap our bill was. We will be back for sure. This is our new favorite place for mexican food!!

Pete's is amazing. This is more of a public service announcement than a review. Sorry, Yelp!  My husband and I went to lunch at the Pete's Fish and Chips on 27th Avenue and Van Buren in Phoenix. When we walked up to the window, there was an elderly Hispanic man standing next to the window, holding a dollar bill. He appeared to be disabled and had one of those carts with wheels and a seat which he used to walk. He spoke to my husband in Spanish, but he doesn't understand Spanish at all and I didn't understand him because he spoke fairly quickly. My husband ordered our food and we sat down. A young couple was sitting at the table next to us with their small child. The father got up and went to the man. He asked him how he can help. The old man replied, but I could not understand him still. The father then ordered food and paid for it. Meanwhile, a woman who had been sitting with her husband at another table got up and gave the elderly man some cash. He thanked her several times. The young father stood with the old man until his food arrived. He helped him put the food and beverage on his cart and the elderly man covered it with a bath towel. The elderly man went on thanking the young man and (I think) blessing the young child. The father hugged the old man and the family left. The other couple left shortly thereafter. At first, I thought that was such a sweet thing to have happened to this poor, crippled, elderly man and felt it was such a good thing to see people helping someone to obtain a basic necessity. But then... The old man walked down to the light and crossed south across Van Buren and then headed back east toward the bus stop across from Pete's. He met up with two younger men; probably in their late twenties, early thirties. He spoke to them and handed them two plates of food and the drink. (Remember, I witnessed the father buy him ONE plate of food...) They talked for a bit while the young men ate the food. The old man then gave one of them cash and he ran back across Van Buren to the Circle K. He emerged shortly with a bag in his hand and ran back over to the man. He handed the elderly man the bag from which the elderly man took out a large can of beer and started drinking it. The bus arrived and the two young men got on it and left. As of right now, the old man is still across the street drinking his beer. What is left of the food is sitting on a half-wall next to him- he hasn't touched it.  I am writing this in hopes that at least one of two things happens: The man can no longer run this scam because people who read this will be aware of it and/or Someone will help him find resources where he can get his needs met another way besides scamming people into feeling bad for him and buying him food out of the kindness of their hearts. Shame on him. Karma is a red-eyed bitch, sir. And she is watching you very closely.

Dear Manager, It is a bad idea to argue in the foyer with a customer who is complaining about how long it took for their to go order. In addition, I suggest you find the source of the vomit-like smell that was the ultimate reason we didn't even wait to be seated.

Excellent food and the waitress we had (I wish I remembered her name) was the sweetest, most attentive waitress I've had at ANY establishment. The prices are a bit high, in my opinion, but for an occasional "special" night, it's okay. :)

Waited twenty minutes for our food. After fifteen, the manager came out and yelled at the staff. A better idea would be to help them get caught up. On top of that, the tortillas were drier than a popcorn fart. Next time...taco bell.

Growing up in Mesa, we used to go to the old school, original Pete's. I was THRILLED when I found out about this location, since I now live out on the westsiiiiiiiiiiiiiide. (Sorry, had to do that.) I love Pete's! The only thing that bums me out is the "cash only" deal. Wtf is this "cash" that people talk about anyway? :)

We had a great time here! As far as other reviewers saying it's not good for kids....I'm not sure what they're talking about. It's a fine place for families to get outside and dine and dance! So, rip those little ones away from the Xbox and head out to some good food and good fun!!!

We LOVE BWW!! My husband is from Canada and before he moved here, he always talked about how much he missed going to BWW. The wing sauce choices are great because there is such a variety, everyone will find something they love. My personal faves are Parmesan Garlic and Asian Zing. 60 cent boneless wings on Thursdays is a great deal. For those of you "offended" by being carded, don't show up. They card everyone. Get over it. Only downfall: Happy hour beer prices are only for draft beer. Draft beer makes me sick so that's a bummer. They do have $4.00 margaritas though, so that makes up for it. Also, on Thursdays they charge for ranch or bleu cheese to go w/ the wings. Whatever. They're still the best!!

Went to BWW for the last UFC fight. There were five of us in our party and we chose to sit out on the patio. The service was incredible and when the sun went down and it got a bit chilly, the staff brought out gas heaters which made a huge difference! The food was wonderful as always and we had plenty left over. Also, to the reviewer who suggested people leave their kids home: Might I suggest you choose a location where children aren't allowed such as the bar area in Native New Yorker. Wild Wings is a FAMILY restaurant. That doesn't mean I condone allowing children to "run amok," however, unless you are in an environment that is specifically for those "over 21," children will probably be there.

Jasmine was our waitress. She is AWESOME! Unfortunately, it's still loud, crowded and overpriced. I give Jasmine 5 stars but the atmosphere dragged it down to two. Also, I had played several songs on the jukebox. During the middle of one of them, it shut off and skipped to my next song....which stopped and went to the next one..I couldn't figure out what was going on until I saw a server with a remote control in front of the TouchTunes machine, skipping through the songs I just played. I went up to her and asked why she was doing that. She told me they were just random songs that plays automatically. I told her that, actually, I had played them. She said that another customer had requested they play something else. Newsflash***It's a machine where you can put money in and choose what you want to hear just like I did!!!!! They couldn't get it to go back and replay the songs she skipped and the manager didn't do a damn thing to correct this. It's certainly not a huge deal, but I thought it was a bit ridiculous that they just randomly decided to do that.... Honestly, this place is just not cutting it, even after their renovations....

The first few times we came here, it was great. Unfortunately that has changed. The menu is smaller, the service is less than subpar and they raised the menu prices.  This is the second time we have been here when they have not brought my order but managed to bring everyone else's. My kids got three refills but the server didn't come back to me once. Additionally, my son ordered his burger without a bun because he can't have gluten and, of course, they brought it on a bun. Just one thing after another and their solution is one return pass. Yeah, not coming back so...keep it.

If this is the location inside the Wal-Mart, I would rather crawl across broken glass and then dive into a pool of rubbing alcohol, than eat at this location again. The managers are terrible on a good day. The employees couldn't care less about their job. The fries taste like they've been fried, frozen and then re-fried. They are horrible. EVERY TIME I GO THERE. Last time I went (my husband actually went...I was just standing there in silent protest), the manager and employees were taking pictures of each other with their cell phones. My husband stood there at the register for quite a bit while they finished screwing around, then the cashier (whose name I don't know because none of them wear name tags) reluctantly came over to help. I got the feeling he was annoyed that we interrupted him and his buddies... The husband got his food and before we made it out of the parking lot (thankfully), we realized the order was wrong and the fries were stale. Again. I so hate this location. Now I insist we go across the parking lot to the stand-alone one.

Though we had a great experience with the buying end of this deal, the rating is for the product quality. I understand when you buy a used vehicle, it's "buyer beware" and we did sign an "as is" paper. However, I would hope that a company like Toyota, and especially this dealership in particular, would stand behind their product...even their used products. We bought a used 2002 Chevy Avalanche from this dealer exactly one week ago today. We traded in my husband's Dakota as he used to have an Avalanche and loved it. Unfortunately, the Avalanche is currently in our driveway with the cylinder heads off because, we think, the valve seals are bad. This would be the best case scenario. It could even be the bottom of the engine, but we're trying to be hopeful. Thank God my husband is mechanically inclined or this would already be costing us at least a thousand dollars. Had we known this was a problem with this vehicle, we would've just kept the Dakota.  Now, to be fair, I did just call the dealership, and left a message stating I was giving them a chance to make this right. If they do, I'll gladly remove this review and update my rating accordingly. However, at this moment, we have a lemon in our driveway, courtesy: Avondale Toyota.

Well, we never recieved a call from them. Too bad. This was the best buying experience I've had in Az. I learned my lesson though...NEVER buy a vehicle that is not under warranty...even from a dealership.  Looks like I'm still shopping for a reputable, honest place to get my next new car. *sigh

Okay, okay... I KNOW it's a fast food joint. I KNOW it's a chain. HOWEVER, let me tell you, the ladies who work there are AMAZING. Their customer service is top notch. The store is always exceedingly clean. The food...well, it's Carls' Jr. It's the same food you'll get at any Carl's Jr. But, the staff at THIS one makes it truly a pleasure! I was very pleasantly surprised. Good job girls!!

Went to the store to change to a better plan which we found online. The store manager, Irv, started out by asking if we have a "really quick question." To which my husband asked, "Why? You need to go to lunch?" If you don't have time to talk to a customer, Irv, it would be better if you said, "Someone will be right with you." That way, I'm not feeling like I'm wasting your time and you don't look like an ass. He looked up our phone plan and said we have the best one. My husband asked him about removing text and talk to Canada because that is now included in the plans. He checked that and said it would give us 10 GB instead of 3 and it's $10 less. My husband stated, "...that sounds like a better plan." Irv then chastised another employee for talking to customers, telling her that's not her job. He then told us we need to call 611 to change our plan. Not only are you sorely lacking in customer service skills, Irv, but your management skills are poor at best.

I work in Buckeye and am getting sick of having Subway every single day, so I thought I'd try something new. Millstone Cafe is an adorable little establishment. It's clean (unlike other places in downtown Buckeye) and the staff is very friendly. I ordered a ham and cheese sandwich with coleslaw. The coleslaw is homemade and very good. The sandwich was yummy too. The ONLY complaint I have is that I felt 8.00 for lunch was a little pricey, but I will definitley return occasionally for the delicious food.

We love the bar staff here. Sam is our girl! :) Always helpful and we never have to ask for a drink. She's on top of it!! The restaraunt side, however, needs some help when it comes to service. No matter how many times we go there, the food takes forever. Hopefully, management will re-train servers to be more prompt. Food is always great!

Dear owners of Native New Yorker, Seriously?? What the hell were you thinking?  First, you knock down the wall that separates the bar from the restaurant. Bad idea. Next, you got rid of the jukebox. Worse idea. What's next?? Get rid of trivia? Music? Wings? I used to love to come here. Now it's just not the same. I cringe when karaoke gets off collar because there are children in the restaurant.  On top of that, your manager yelled at a patron across the entire bar that he has dogs in the back of his truck with no water. Dude...it's like 60 degrees out...plus, you totally could have walked over to him and said it privately instead of blasting him all over the bar. You have turned one of our favorite places into another lame-ass restaurant. Sigh*   Sincerely,   Former patron

Whatever. It's Wal-mart. HOWEVER am I the only one who gets ELECTROCUTED every time I am in this store??? There is some weird problem I have (I'm so not kidding) with THIS store. EVERYTHING I touch shocks me. At first I thought maybe there was a short in their freezers or something, but it happens just walking through the store. (the cart zaps me every once in a while) What is up with that?? Lol

After the HORRIBLE experience I had down the street at Full Circle, David and his crew at Superstar Car Wash did a FANTASTIC job of "making things right". (See my review on Full Circle for the whole story. Right now, I'm tired of typing.) I will ALWAYS take my trucks to this location from now on. Thanks David!

I've been going to Longhorn's off and on for years. Now, we venture out to Longhorn's occasionally when Roman's doesn't have anything going on. The service is GREAT, though I feel the food prices are a bit high for lunch. The quality of the food is always good and the staff are friendly. I do wish they'd bring back Exit 195 as the house band, but the entertainment they have now is decent.

I checked this place out one day when I had some time to kill. I'm not exactly sure what the draw is. I found the prices outrageous...especially for a place that talks non-stop about their low prices. Not good.  I prefer Trader Joes.

We usually love this place. However, today, we waited well over an hour for our food. And that it's not counting the twenty minute wait to place or order. We watched three different couples sit next to us at the counter, eat and leave before our food even came up. When it finally did, my order was up but my husband's wasn't even started. The waitress tried to blame the kitchen staff, stating they are new and training, but we've been eating here for a long time and the cook has been there since the beginning. On top of this, my food wasn't cooked right. I've never had such poor service here. We ended up leaving and going across the street to Ihop. Hopefully, they can manage their time better.

DO NOT EVER GO TO THIS CARWASH!!!! There. You've been warned. Screw "convenience". SCREW the damn owner who stands out by the vacuums. My husband and I have been customers here for over two years. In fact, up until last month, we were at this carwash every other week, if not every week. That changed today. I will NEVER EVER take another vehicle here. "Why, Gretchen," you ask, "what ever happened that could make you write such a negative review?" Well, I'll tell you.   I expect service-based businesses to provide excellent customer service. ESPECIALLY when the service is mediocre at best. Even more especially when I have been a loyal REFERRING customer for over two years. So, here's what happened:  First, I pull up to the vacuum area and I'm immediately approached by scary-glass-replacing guy who says, "I know you. You're here all the time right?"   I said, "I am here all the time, yes." But I'm thinking, "No, you don't KNOW me. You see me drive my truck up to the damn car wash. That hardly constitutes 'knowing' me, creepy McCreepster." He then says he remembers the crack in my windshield, (wtf?), but couldn't remember why I didn't get it fixed. To which I replied, "Because I don't have glass coverage on  my insurance."   "Oh, THAT'S right," he says, "So, what's your credit like?" ....Okay, creepy-freako, I'm not trying to buy an effing house. I just want to get my damn truck washed. You don't need to know my credit history, blood type, marital status, gross monthly income, ages of my children or any other personal information. You don't need to see any identification. These aren't the droids you're looking for. Move along. (Sorry, sometimes my "geek" shows.)  Anyway, I tell him I have a friend who does all my body work and will replace my windshield. He asks how much my friend charges. "$183", I reply.   "Well," he pretends to ponder, "I'll be losing money," (yeah right), "but I'll do it for that price to get your business." Whatever. Change the effing windshield. Just let me wash my damn car, creepfest.  The owner then comes over, asks me what wash I want. I tell him the VIP and that I need the mats and carpet shampooed because my kid had a gas can in the back and it leaked. He tells me he can do all of that for $35.00. Perfect. I leave the truck there and go inside.   While I'm waiting, my husband shows up. He is LIVID. Apparently, he pulled up to get his truck washed shortly after I did. The owner asked him what he wanted done. My husband said, he wanted the same thing he always gets: The truck washed plus Armor-all on the body panels and leather conditioner on the seats. The owner tells my husband the prices which adds up to almost $70.00. My husband was FLOORED because he always goes there and gets that done for $35.00 total. He asked if their prices went up and the owner said that their prices are always the same. Bull $*!#!!! We have NEVER paid that much to get his truck cleaned. So, my husband tells the owner, "I'm here ALL the time and I NEVER pay that much." The owner tells him, "I've never seen you here before."  ......Are you F&$#ing kidding me??!!! Now, I don't expect everyone to remember me. HOWEVER, when I'm a patron of your business EVERY OTHER WEEK FOR TWO YEARS, and you write down my CANADIAN license plate every time I go there, I expect to at LEAST be somewhat recognized. Go ask Creepypants, the glass guy. HE remembers me. For crying out loud..  SO........I go out and tell them to stop what their doing on my truck. You want to be an a$$hole and not only tell me you have NEVER seen me before but also try to charge DOUBLE what you usually do??!! You just lost my business pal.   We ended up taking our trucks over to the Car Wash on 99th Ave and McDowell where David not only DETAILED my husband's truck, but also finished the inside of MY truck (which the first place did totally half-assed anyway,) for LESS than what it would've cost us to get them both done at  Full Circle.   Even though it's a little bit further to drive for us, we will ALWAYS go to the place on 99th from now on. And you should too!

I was out of the state when I got a phone call from my hysterical 16 year old daughter. Apparently, she and her friend had decided to color their hair and it turned into a disaster. This wouldn't be that big of a deal, except that this happened to be the day of a formal dance at her school. My daughter had walked to Sally's to try to figure out what to do. I told her to just ask the person working there to help. This girl helped my daughter find exactly what she needed to correct the problem. She was sympathetic and very kind and helped to save the day! Couple that with one of my very best friends stepping in like a fairy godmother and my daughter had a fantastic time at the dance...and she looked beautiful. :)

I spent several hours and a couple hundred dollars getting my hair cut and colored. She did a fantastic job so I went back to have her do my hair again. That's when the diva act came into play. The "greeter" went to the stylist and told her that I wanted to know if she had time for a cut. She looked at me and told the greeter she didn't know me and then turned her back to continue with her customer. The greeter came back and apologized and told me that the stylist didn't have time for me today but other stylists were available. I was somewhat embarrassed and definitely put off at that treatment, so I left. I don't expect everyone to remember who I am, but I do expect someone to at least talk to me directly and let me know that they are booked that day but they can help me find another stylist or something. Her arrogance was a real turn off.

Horrible service from RUDE employees. Also, if you read the five star reviews on here, they are obviously from employees. Do NOT go to this location if you expect any type of decent customer service.

We love this park and our puppies do too! Of course, there is the occasional owner who needs a swift kick in the pants, but you'll find that anywhere.   I find it humorous that one woman was complaining to me about someone she encountered before who let her kids play with the dogs....(not sure why that's a bad thing, but, whatever...) and she had NO idea that they were my kids she was talking about. Lol! I guess next time I'll scold the kids for playing? I'm not sure what this woman expected.  Also, my husband had to get someone else's dog off of ours (It was biting our dog) and got bit by the other dog in the process. The owner apologized up and down saying that his dog has NEVER done anything like that before. The funny thing is, I was there 2 weeks prior when his dog attacked someone else's dog. I think that perhaps he doesn't know what the word "NEVER" means.    Anyway, like I said, other than a couple of dingbats, this place is cool.

Just a quick update and a note to other owners. I keep reading/hearing people referring to the park as having two sides: one side for "good" dogs and one side for "bad" dogs. I'm not sure if people are too lazy to read the signs on the gates or if they just have a limited vocabulary which causes them to assign incorrect definitions to the words on the signs.   Let me set the record straight: one side is for ACTIVE dogs. The other side is for PASSIVE dogs. This does not say, nor does it mean, one side is for AGGRESSIVE dogs and the other is not. If your dog is AGGRESSIVE, it is NOT allowed at the dog park.   The ACTIVE side is for dogs who are ACTIVELY running and play hard. They are usually the bigger breeds, however, little ones are more than welcome.   The PASSIVE side is for older dogs or dogs that are there for more of the social aspect rather than the exercise and energy release.   Hopefully, this clears things up as I am tired of having to leave because of irresponsible people who think their dog is welcome to start trouble.

I love Einstein Brothers Bagels. When I moved to Ohio for a few years, I actually drove over an hour to the nearest location in Michigan. They have THE BEST bagels in town. Bummer that they got rid of the Veggie Confetti bagel as that was my all time fave. I always get fast, courteous service at this location and the store is always clean. Bravo!

Last night was the "Field of Screams" event at Goodyear Ballpark. In previous years, this event has been hosted by the City Park over on LItchfield and Thomas. It should have stayed there. This was the most disappointing event I have been to in a long time. They used the strip of grass around the field to set up rides, a few booths and.....well, that's about it.  As far as the rides went, they had four...I think. Two were on the west side of the field and two were clear over on the east side of the field. In between were a couple booths. The ticket prices for the rides were ridiculous. You could pay ten dollars for unlimited rides...on four rides...so lame.  The only food vendor, other than the outrageously priced ballpark vendors, was an ice cream truck. In years prior, there were so many vendors with delicious, reasonably priced food! There were games for the kids where they gave out candy as prizes. It was a great time. At the ballpark, you could buy food from the ballpark vendors if you wanted to pay $10 for a burger or $5 for a hot dog. If I were there watching a game, I'd expect to be gouged by the food prices. But NOT when I'm there for a family event.  Also, in prior years, the costume contest was separated into age groups. The contest at the ballpark included everyone and only the top three got prizes. Cheap. Lame. Lastly, can I just say that someone should have been more conscious that this was a family-type event and not let 14 year old girls in see-through tights parade around the ball park? It's a shame that some girls are allowed to dress like that and NO ONE says anything. There was a girl there last night dressed in a skirt that ended just below her waist. She was wearing see-through red tights. You could see EVERYTHING. I could not believe how inappropriate that was. It's one thing if you are an adult, going to a private party with other adults. However, when you are a teenager, going to a family friendly event, you put some damn pants on. Shame on Goodyear. This was a poorly planned excuse to make a buck.

YUM! I was trying to think of something different for lunch. Sometimes, I get tired of the Estrella Parkway choices...Then, I remembered this little gem. The food is so yummy. (Got the veggie pizza). The veggies are fresh, they cook the pizza to order and the service is friendly and prompt. Prices aren't bad either!

I can't believe I haven't been here before. After a long day at the mall, dealing with way too many Christmas shoppers, all I wanted was a quiet dinner before heading back home with the family. My kids suggested Augie's. At first I was worried that it would be the typical, loud, overcrowded sports bar. Though we did have to wait for a table (it was, after all, Saturday night), it wasn't annoyingly loud at all.   I was a little taken aback by the prices...that is, until the food came. The portions are HUGE and the food is really good!   The best part of the night: there was a live band playing music from the 50's through today- mostly rock- and everyone was dancing. My sons and I danced to several songs. My husband and I did as well. It was so much fun! My eldest son (10) was a hit with the ladies as he did the can-can with them to "New York, New York"! I must say I was definitely happily surprised. We will be back; with and without the kids!

Don't join unless you plan on staying with this gym FOREVER. Trying to cancel your membership is more difficult than achieving world peace. I specifically joined because they have a lap pool but the chlorine is so ridiculously high, it makes me sick. I advised the front desk and was told it's monitored and kept at a safe level. Silly me. I guess it's normal to find it difficult to breathe in the pool area due to the overwhelming chlorine smell. It's also normal to be unable to open your eyes under water for fear of them burning out of your skull. And, it's pretty normal to be sick after being in the pool... I think I'll just stick to my DVD's for now. I've made more progress toward my fitness goal in my living room than I ever did at this gym anyway. :/

We love this hospital! My son has Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis and is, therefore, a regular patient to the rheumatologist. Dr. Ede and his staff are wonderful. We would never go anywhere else!!

I would warn anyone who is thinking about going to this doctor to think twice. I waited nearly an hour after my appointment time to be seen. His medical assistant mumbles so quietly, you can't understand him. I had to have him repeat everything he said at least twice. There is some young girl who does x-rays. She rolled her eyes at me so many times while I was talking, I'm surprised they didn't roll out of her head. Dr. Cox was rude and didn't listen to a damn thing I said. He basically sold me some night splints for my son and didn't explain what they were even supposed to do. Have you ever had a child try to sleep with huge plastic boots on? And without explanation as to why? Not going to happen. We were given a couple of referrals some pages with exercises on it and a list of expensive shoes. My son is still in pain and we have zero answers. In talking with a coworker, her husband had a similar experience. We are definitely going elsewhere for another opinion. I wish I could give zero stars.

My boys LOVE going to "Dino's" place for pizza and wings. The food is as close to authentic New York pizza as you can get this far from Manhattan. We are die hard fans!

I love this pizza! I don't know what "Jerry Q" has been eating or who he has been talking to, but this place is the best around! The owner is always friendly and the food is excellent. I have had the privilege of dining on Manhattan pizza several times and this is as close as it gets out here! This is definitely a paralell to the other pizza place I reviewed in Goodyear. Yum!!

I took my kids for dinner tonight. They ordered their meals and I ordered a Baja salad. They gave me my kids' food and the cashier told me they were just waiting on the chili for my salad. I went and sat down with my kids. I went back up ten minutes later to see where the rest of my order was. The cashier told me he had to have the chili checked. He yelled back for someone to check the chili. Someone in the back yelled they couldn't check it and stated they were too busy to check it. The cashier told me he would have someone check the chili in a few minutes so I stood there for another five minutes waiting. Someone then finally checked the chili and said it wasn't ready yet. By this time, my kids had finished their meals and were eating their Frosties. At that point, I told them to take the salad off my order. The cashier called the manager over and told her he needed a refund. She asked him, "Why do we need a refund?" The cashier told her the chili wasn't ready for the salad. The manager handed the cashier the keys. He then told her I don't need the keys. It's on a card. (I used my debit card.) At that point, she got very angry, slammed down whatever it was she was doing and came over to do the refund. She was rude and obviously VERY angry. In fact, it seemed that every single employee there was in a terrible mood. I understand people have bad days, but there is absolutely no excuse for every person in there to be treating the customer like they are an inconvenience. If it is so inconvenient for them to serve me my food, I'll be happy to take my business elsewhere. In fact, I left there and went down the road to Quiznos for my dinner. The real slap in the face to me was the fact that there is a banner hanging up on their wall stating "Customers are #1".

If I owned this location, I would fire everyone and start from scratch. There are two customers in the building and every table it's dirty. The staff lack social skills. Ihonestly forgot that I don't like this location, or I would have gone somewhere else.

I'm surprised to see the amount of people who are pleased with this gym. Personally, I only gave it one star because it's not possible to give fewer. First, Randy the instructor, is a total ass. He is rude and arrogant. HOWEVER, I know I'm not going to like everyone I come across in this world, so I overlooked that. We let them know on several occasions that there was equipment that was not working...which never got fixed. To top it off, the first day my kids were in the child care, my son ended up having to get stitches because another child was swinging a scooter around in the air and hit him in the face with it. I'm sorry, but where the hell were the people who were supposed to be watching the kids??? When we brought issues up to the Member Service people, they told us that they had had numerous complaints about all of these areas, but no one ever puts them in writing so nothing is ever done. Well, now it's in writing. If I'm paying $150 a month, I expect better than this.

My review is a bit tardy and for that, I apologize.   So, my first thought was, "What the heck is so great about hot dogs? I mean, they're hot dogs for crying out loud." I am here today to admit I was very wrong.   Ivy League Dogs has the BEST hot dogs I have ever had. Oh. My. God. I had a chili cheese dog with onions. It was fantastic. The only thing I would do different is ask for more chili and less onions next time, but that was my bad. The service was friendly. The place is very clean. The food is delicious. I will definitely be back!!!

Boooooooo. We were SO not pleased with this experience.  First, the buns were so hard and dry I could hardly choke mine down. I ordered the chicken sandwich with bleu cheese. The chicken breast was TINY...smaller than the palm of my hand. The bleu cheese was good, but how can you screw that up? They wanted to charge extra for grilled onions but raw onions were free. I'm not exactly sure how that makes sense but, whatever. The sweet potato fries were good w/ the fry sauce but that was, literally, the best part of the experience. I don't know if this was an off day, but, frankly, I'm not sure if I want to find out.

We love TJ's. The service is always fast and friendly. The food is consistently good...well, except for one time when my husband ordered the fish fry. It was WAAAAY too salty but considering how many times we've been there, one bad day is forgivable. The prices are unbelievably affordable. We are definitely fans. :)

We frequented this restaurant a lot over the past five years. In fact, there was a time we were going every other weekend. Unfortunately that changed yesterday. Since the restaurant was renovated, my husband and I have been there three or four times. I understand that now that they can accommodate many more customers, the service is going to be slower and the stress levels will be higher. However, what happened yesterday was inappropriate, unprofessional and unacceptable. I ordered what I order every single time I go there. My husband did the same. In fact, I joked with the waitress that she should make copies of the ticket so she can just have them ready whenever we come in. After my husband and I placed our orders, the waitress walked away, checked the window for other tables' food. Talked to the other servers. Got my coffee and my husband's soda and snagged some creamer off of another table for me. At that point, I asked if she could change my toast from dry wheat to raisin bread. She informed me that was fine since she hadn't even put the ticket in yet. Um......okay??? This particular server is new and I get that. However, you write the ticket, hang it in the window, then go do other stuff.  After waiting another thirty minutes (again, I get they were busy and I was willing to overlook this) she brought out my eggs, bacon and grits. She told me she was waiting on the bread. My eggs were the consistency of rubber. When she came back over with my husband's plate, I asked her if she could have them remake my eggs as they were overdone. She took the plate, walked over to the kitchen and put my eggs on a separate little dish. She brought the bacon and grits back, along with my husband's food. She went back to the window and retrieved a new plate of eggs for me and brought them back over to me; by which time my husband had pointed out his eggs were not over-medium either, but were still clear where the whites were undercooked. He had taken his eggs and put them on his toast plate for her so she could just take them to the kitchen to be replaced. When she handed the cook that second plate of eggs is when the problem started.  The waitress and another woman I can only assume is the manager stood in front of the window while the cook screamed, yelled and threw things (yes, THREW things) like a two year old child who was told "No." He yelled and screamed about eggs and "stupid people" and cooking for a good thirty seconds before my husband went and informed the owner, Don. When my husband and Don walked back, the cook was still screaming and yelling. As Don was walking into the kitchen, we heard a dish crashing and Don yelling at the cook.  While this was going on, the waitress brought me my raisin toast which looked like it had been chewed up and spit out on the plate. Seriously, the presentation was just very poor and by this time, I was just over the whole thing.  A few minutes later, Don emerged from the kitchen with two eggs, cooked over medium. He put them in front of my husband who thanked him. Don told him to "check them." My husband told him they were fine. Don insisted he check them again. So, my husband stuck his fork in them and stated again that they were fine.  Then, the waitress shows Don the plate of raisin bread. She mumbled something and he yelled, "She ordered raisin bread and....what???!!" The waitress looked like she was about to cry, so I said, "It looks like someone chewed it up and spit it out on the plate." He took it and went back into the kitchen. By this time, I had just completely lost my appetite. I got the car keys from my husband and went out to the car.  My husband advised that after I left, Don came back out with two new pieces of bread. He advised Don that I had left and Don threw it in the trash and exclaimed, "I TRIED! I tried to make it right!"  My husband finished his eggs and was told there was no bill (I should certainly think not!). As he was leaving, Don told him, "Have a nice life." So, here's the thing: If you own a business in the service industry especially, there occasionally will be a complaint. However, you should realize that your customers are your source of income and the reason you even have a business. In the five years I have been going there, I have never once complained about the food...EVER. Yesterday it was completely warranted and I left there feeling as if I were the "bad guy." Well after five years of supporting this local business, I can honestly say I will never be back there. I'm a bit disappointed because it was our favorite place to go for breakfast, but I'm not going to be a patron somewhere that treats their customers as an annoying inconvenience. And, honestly, I would have been okay but not for the fit the cook threw. That is where it all went downhill. They're just eggs. You're not doing brain surgery, dude. Take a valium and chill out.  As for me, I'll be going to Black Bear diner from now on.

First of all, this is a HUGE store with everything from lawn chairs to peanut butter. The prices are decent, but you need a map to find anything....and they provide one. Seriously.  The deli counter help is terrible. I ordered a sub for an office party THREE DAYS before the party. It was supposed to be ready for pickup at 6:30 am. I arrived at the store and the deli person had JUST gotten there...which would be fine had she made the sandwich in advance. But, no, I had to wait for her...(she said it would take her 10 minutes. It took 30). They did discount the sandwich a few dollars, but I was still late to work...Not okay. I also ordered 2 dozen donuts. The baker made 12 dozen donuts. Such a waste!! Lastly, the Thanksgiving ad for turkey is misleading at best. In HUGE red letters, it proclaims "$.29 per pound" then underneath in itty bitty letters it reads "for the first 1 pound". Are you kidding me???? Shame on you Fry's ad people.

I just have to ask: Am I the only person who feels as if the Fry's cashiers must get a bonus for scanning your card before your items? Let me explain.  I am weird. Yep. I'm admitting it. If you have read any of my other reviews, you probably already know this. Anyway, I like to have my items scanned first and my Fry's card scanned last. I want to see the horribly shocking cost of groceries decrease at the end of my transaction. I don't know why. I just want it that way. However, there is one cashier in particular who gets rather pissy when I do this. He seriously acts like I told him his baby is ugly when I tell him I'll scan it after. And really...why do you care, Fry's cashier man? What difference does it make to you?  I was going to try to avoid you and your silly pouting about the preference of my scannings BUT... I think it will be more fun to seek you out and make you scan my groceries first every time. Look out! I'm just cuh-ray-zee like that.

Holy best pizza I've ever had, Batman! I was curious about this place...probably because I've been bombarded by Naked advertising for the past year or so. I was a bit wary about the price, but I understand that I get what I pay for...blah blah blah.   I read their spiel about the all-natural ingredients and how their quality compares to the big chains. I'm still a major skeptic and require proof of all things before I believe anything. So, we ordered our pizzas today at 5pm. They arrived at 5:22. No, I'm not exaggerating. I was blown away. Not only do they have pizza ovens that defy the laws of physics, they own transporters that beam them to your front door a la Captain Kirk. All I know is if my kids are playing outside when I order from there, I'll be sure to bring them in within 15 minutes so they don't get plowed over by the delivery guy's car. (No, I don't think this is a plus but, damn, they were fast. I just wish they could be fast and safe!)  Aaaaaaaaaaanyway, when I opened the box, I have to admit I was disappointed. It didn't look like a 14 inch pizza. My husband whipped out his...tape measure and...what? .... Whatever. Point is, it really IS 14 inches.   So, I took a bite. There were no fireworks, nor did my taste buds dance like Willy Wonka's Oompa Loompas. (I always have that picture in my head when I eat food that is just "to die for".) It was...well, it was good. It was definitely different than the pizza we usually order (Pizza Hut). I finished my first slice and went back for seconds. No sense in judging it on one piece, right? The second piece was even better than the first, and the third, well, let's just say that the more I ate, the better it tasted. I don't know why. That's just what happened. Maybe it's like Starbucks who put heroin in the coffee cup lids. You don't know why you love it. You just do, and the more you have it, the more you want it. I'm serious. Heroin in the lids. It's true. I looked it up on snopes.  Back to the pizza.  The bottom line is: If you want really good pizza and you don't mind paying a little more for food that is not over-processed, artery-clogging garbage, this is the place to get it. It would be nice if they threw out a coupon or two though.

Let me start off by stating this: my 9 year-old son is the pickiest eater in the western United States. That said, he ate EVERYTHING and LOVED it!!!!! I knew he would eat his sandwich (pulled pork) but, he actually ate the beans and asked for more!!! I'm telling you, this kid wouldn't eat baked beans if it was the last bit of food on Earth.  The meat and sauce is absolutely delicious. The sides are to die for and the cornbread...MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm! This is my new favorite place for dinner. Absolutely the BEST bbq around!

Finally had a chance to use the gift card I got for my birthday which is in July. I had a wonderful experience starting the minute I walked in. The girl at the front desk was pleasant and welcoming. The entire atmosphere all throughout was warm and relaxing and Priscilla, my massage therapist, was patient, kind and gave me a wonderful massage. I will definitely be returning and will probably bring my son  as he has Juvenile Arthritis and would likely benefit from massage.  Definitely recommended!!

The Buckeye location doesn't have a yelp page yet so I'll put this on here.  My husband and I checked out this new location and were excited to have a new choice for dinner. I was a bit put off by the live entertainment....not because it was bad...he was actually quite good....it was just very loud. But I was willing to overlook this. We were seated immediately and greeted by our server quickly. He asked if we had been there before and we said we had not. He sat down and went over the menu with us. So far, so good. We ordered our drinks and perused the menu. We then waited for thirty minutes while the entire waitstaff walked past us over and over again, not once asking if we had placed our order...even though we had menus on the table in front of us. We finally decided to pay for our drinks and leave. We stood at the bar for another ten minutes before we just left. Such a disappointment!!!!!

I was hoping to find a nice alternative to the limited choices on MC85. I was disappointed. The sandwich was bland. Definitely not worth the price. I was given homemade potato chips which damn near broke my teeth because they were so hard. It's the same food as Millstone Cafe but without any flavor. If I'm going to pay that much for a sandwich, I expect it to taste better than average. :(

Great bagels, yummy coffee, friendly service. The ONLY reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is they get slowed down significantly by only having one toaster. Sometimes it takes a very long time to get my order. Other than that, it's great!

My husband and I have had several pieces done by Taija. In fact, she is the only artist my husband allows to do his work. She is an amazing artist and a good person in general. She is very proud of the shop and is insistent on safety and cleanliness above all else. I wish Taija and Duane all the best in this venture.

The service has gone completely downhill. I sat at the bar for ten minutes while the bartender had her back to me, talking with other customers. When she turned around, she still didn't acknowledge me and rang them up instead. Losing Tia and Hailey was the worst thing ever that happened to this place. Well just go to native from now on.

Our youngest has Juvenile Arthritis. His gluten-free diet has helped to alleviate his symptoms; however, it leaves him longing for donuts, cookies, etc. This cafe is his new favorite spot to eat!! He was so excited that he could order ANYTHING on the menu!!!! He had the hamburger and we treated him to a rocky road brownie. He was so happy and wouldn't stop talking about how good everything was! The brownie caused him quite the dilemma as he lamented, "It's so good, I want to eat it all up, but I want to eat it slowly!"  The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable, making this a wonderful experience all around.

The last two times I have been to your location, I have had horrible customer service. I went there last week and the manager, whose name I don't know because she doesn't wear a nametag, seemed irritated that there were customers there. She has a terrible attitude. Today, my husband went there and stood in line with another customer for ten minutes before leaving because the crew members were too busy talking to each other to come out and take anyone's order. I'm very disappointed because when this location first opened, the service was great. I hope someone reads this and does something about it. Because in a community this small, word gets around quickly and you'll soon not have any customers.

Ugh. You would think I would've learned my lesson by now. Slowest service ever. Two drinks. That's all I ordered. Two drinks took almost twenty minutes!! I would've left but I was in the drive thru with cars in front and behind me.
