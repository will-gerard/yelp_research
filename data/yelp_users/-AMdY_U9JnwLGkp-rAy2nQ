Great atmosphere.  Food I can buy a better cut of steak at Safeway at a discount any day of the week.

Excellent, by far the best gourmet pizza in AZ. This place is everything that the other more famous pizza joints promise to be and fail to achieve.  Their sauce is robust and flavorful,  toppings are top notch, crust the perfect char.  Great, hip, downtown city atmosphere.  Friendly staff, prompt service but not rushed. Thank you for finally bring a good pizza joint to downtown Phoenix.

Second time here and they did a repeat  great food and drink. Think this will be a regular hang out. It's about time we have an original menu in Phoenix and not just another crappy Fox Restaurant Concept  regurgitation.  Keep it up guys you are on to something great!

It's ok far from great. I got two varieties of the tacos. $3.25 plus each. Should be no more than $2 each. They were nothing to write  home about. The salsa has a funky taste to it. I think they put sugar in it. The margaritas are cheap and weak. I would eat here again if passing by but it's not a place I would suggest  to go to. The service needs a lot of work had to flag down the server for everything including salt.
