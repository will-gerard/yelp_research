A great animal shelter that does wonderful work in the Valley. I adopted my puppy when he was 8 weeks old from AAWL. My only concern was that he fell very sick a week after we got him and the vet bill was substantial. Chances are it was an illness he picked up while at county's shelter or AAWL so it was a little frustrating. While they offer ShelterCare gift insurance it is EXTREMELY limited in what they will cover, so all of the expenses came out of pocket although both AAWL and I thought they would help out.  That said, AAWL does amazing work. I would absolutely go back and adopt from them again. If you're considering getting an animal go to a shelter! They are the best dogs and you can save two lives :)

Location was convenient and our server was very nice. The food was just nothing to write home about. We could've gone to Ra for the same food at a cheaper price...  The Spicy Tuna was very good. We decided to try something new and go with the Houston roll which was good for the first few bites and then just got...weird.   Overall, the food was OK but overpriced for the quality.

Ahhmazing cheesesteak. Was a bit of a wait but pretty much worth it. Loved the wine selection and other grocery goodies!

I drove from south Chandler to Anthem specifically for Dollyrockers...repeatedly. Tracy is amazing when it comes to cuts and color. She has gotten it right every time- and I am PICKY about my bangs.  The salon itself is super cute and trendy without being pretentious. The prices are reasonable. I really like their line of products...huge fan of the Primp & Prime and straightening gloss.

Had my first experience at SanTan on a Friday night. The food was ok, the beer was mediocre. Our server was exceptional, wish I could remember his name. I think the thing that really turned me off was how HOT it was. It was miserable trying to eat, drink and be merry while you're near sweating on a cool Arizona night. For the money you're better off going to Four Peaks where the food is incredible and the beer is tasty!

I'm another Grouponer...  Courtenay was the best- and totally adorable! The artwork in the waxing room is nice to look at and she played some awesome music, too. She did a very thorough job with waxing and was extremely professional while still being personable. The whole process was quick without being rushed. My eyebrows look great, too!   Love love LOVE the online scheduling system. I'm awful at prebooking since my schedule is constantly changing, so being able to schedule a service relatively last minute was nice.  The salon itself is cute, very clean, and nicely decorated. There is a reason for all of the positive reviews; they have earned them. I will definitely be back.

I'm usually at this location on my way to work or the on on Rural in Tempe. I've never had a bad experience at either! Wonderful drinks and everyone here is so HAPPY. They are consistently the happiest baristas I've ever seen and their drinks are incredible. I usually either just get a plain coffee (which is always great) or an Annihilator if I feel like indulging....it's awesome. Once you go to Dutch Bros you'll never long for Starbucks again.

The wine was great. The bar was super cute and the patio was awesome.  Our service was nothing short of horrendous. Our waitress would rarely come check on us, and when she did she would walk away before we had a chance to speak. We asked for a bottle of wine then brought us glasses. After reminding her that we wanted the bottle she was reluctant to come up with a solution to her mistake. Her initial response was something to the effect of "I just filled the glasses you drank out of, so I can't take them back." After discussing it she told us that she would comp four glasses of wine and charge for the bottle. Seemed fair to us, so we were more than happy to work with her.  Then came the check. Overcharged us and overcharged our friends. When I brought it to her attention she got extremely snippy and told us that she had said she would comp our NEXT four glasses of wine. Since we only had three glasses each (the two we ordered initially, then the two we had that were supposed to be the bottle rather than the four each she claimed) it didn't exactly make sense. There was no attempt to recover from her awful service, all she did was argue with us while the manager sat and watched.   I'd love to try 5th and Wine on a different night, but if this server comes near our table I'm out.

Dr. Wing and his staff are nothing short of the best. My initial consultation was a breeze and Dr. Wing was very helpful. They worked very well with me to establish a payment plan. Like Mike, I went with invisalign since the cost ended up being the same as traditional braces.   I cannot say enough good things about this office. I drive all the way from Chandler/Tempe to come out here and it is worth it. If you're hunting for an orthodontist you have to check out Wing Orthodontics!

Rooney is quite the anxious dog, so we decided to pay Tammy a visit for some private lessons. Very, very reasonably priced. You can definitely tell that Tammy knows what she's doing (if you couldn't figure that out by her extensive background with animals) and she explains things in a way that makes sense, but doesn't make you feel like the world's worst pet owner.  Within a couple of days we've already been able to correct some of Rooney's (and our own!) behavior. I'm looking forward to our next session, and am definitely going to be signing up for the group obedience training as well!

It does not get better than this.  I'm not one for hot dogs, so I always opt for the chicken dog. They have some crazy combinations that are absolutley fabulous. The pita bread they use for the bun puts it above the rest. It's different for sure, but so worth the money. It's filling for sure!  They feature a dog of the week sent in by customers which is pretty cool.  I never thought anything gourmet could be sold out of a truck, but Short Leash proved me wrong!

Great newer yoga studio in Mesa. Like a few other people I discovered Floating Lotus via Groupon, but even after my deal is up I'm sure I'll come back. The studio itself is beautiful. Steve is always super friendly whenever you check in and the instructors are wonderful. Floating Lotus is very welcoming and not at all pretentious like some other studios in the Valley. I look forward to them growing and expanding their class schedule!

Love me some Brenna and Bronzeology.  She was able to squeeze me in last minute before my vacation. I'm extremely pale naturally, but she was able to give me a tan that looked like I had been on the beach for a few days, and it looks sooo natural! Brenna herself is super sweet and welcoming. Totally the kind of girl you'd want to hang out with...but I am a little biased to Midwestern transplants.  Prices are quite reasonable, especially for the results!

It was OK.  My boyfriend enjoyed his sandwich and soup, so at least there's that. I had the strawberries & cream french toast...it was pretty cold. I'd give it a second shot for the lunch fare. The location is nice and the decor was cute. The food was just nothing to write home about.

Really not anything to write home about.  Customer service from the front desk is subpar at best, usually a pretty long wait after your appointment. There's one guy (Jeff maybe?) that's the lead vet tech who is very friendly and knowledgeable, but overall I'm not impressed.   If you're willing to make the drive, the Banfield in Chandler near Gilbert Rd and the 101 is fantastic.

This place is incredible.   They have a very mellow, laid back vibe going on here. The employees are friendly and not pretentious at all (a trait I've noticed throughout old town).   Cartel is a great place to hang out or study- music is chill and not too loud. Not to mention the chai is amazing. Seriously, like nothing I've had before. Definitely try it out!

I really like it here. The food is great, love the crunchy roll and the california special, but the water always tastes weird. Like a funky, almost dirty taste. Order a diet coke or something instead. The service is all right...nothing exceptional but it's not horrendous. Good place for sushi in Chandler! Definitely go for happy hour.

Maybe Jessica was having an off day?  The building itself was easy to find. Very cute decor inside. The ability to schedule appointments online is awesome. Their hours are incredible too!  The tan itself left something to be desired. The color was a little on the orange side fort liking. I had to ask her to cover certain areas that she avoided all together. After I mentioned some smudging in one area she seemed annoyed about having to fix it which made me uncomfortable about pointing out other areas I had problems with. The next day after rinsing in the shower I noticed two streaks on the inside of both of my calves that hadn't even been sprayed! I also thought drying myself off was a little weird. Tans I've gotten elsewhere the person doing it has done the drying since they know when it's done.   All in all I didn't have the great experience that other Yelpers had. The prices were great, but I would be willing to pay a little more for better quality.

You need Crossfit Blur in your life.  I've always been a little lazy when it comes to my workout regimen- would go to yoga once in awhile and try to go for a jog on occasion, but could usually find something better to do. Like watch Law and Order...for a few hours.   A friend of mine finally convinced me to check out Blur and I finally obliged. Being the "chubby girl" all my life, I was so intimidated to walk in and see these incredibly fit people climbing around the gym like spider monkeys. Jake and Justin made me feel at ease immediately. They scaled down the workouts into something manageable (but still ass-kicking) and working out has finally become fun and enjoyable. Even the members themselves are so nice! Everyone introduces themselves and cheers you on.  Long story short, this is a great place to be! It's been just over two months and I look forward to coming here as often as possible and trying to be better than I was the day before. Justin, Jake, and the rest of the Blur crew will make you feel right at home and get you into amazing shape!

Good food and drinks as is normal for Postino. However, we consistently had to wait to place orders for new drinks when our glasses we're empty and we're not acknowledged when we wanted food. We were given our check without being asked if we wanted it, well before closing hours. Ultimately disappointed, especially knowing what they are capable of.

Looooved it.  Everything was so cute in this place! It was nice and relaxing. I believe it was Mindy who did my pedicure...she did great. The staff was quite friendly; not at all pretentious like some Scottsdale places. They also squeezed me in for a pedicure very last minute. :)  Like others said it's a bit more expensive than a strip mall salon, but well worth it for sanitary tools and higher quality products.   It would be nice if they had a wider selection of colors...Essie's collection is huge! That's the only thing I can think to improve upon.

This place was amazing.  After suffering through too many shin splints (and being relatively certain it was because of my generic Nikes) I decided to finally drop some $$ on a good pair.  Since it was Veteran's Day with only one employee working it was a little busy. However, he did a great job at circulating, meeting everyone's needs, and answering questions. I never felt rush or ignored, and he did a great job at finding me a quality pair of running shoes. He was genuinely patient and kind and seemed to care about finding the best shoe for you without any pressure.  While I was walking around the store to test out these shoes I noticed some pretty cool running gear too. Sweatybandz (the most amazing headbands ever, but that's a whole different review), energy snacks, Patagonia and other nice apparel in stock. The store is clean and not intimidating at all. They do a great job at fitting for shoes and take video on their iPad to show you how you're running and how the shoes work.  The gentleman helping me today also informed me about a running class they have every Tuesday to help improve posture, steps, etc. It looked like they had different classes and groups relatively often, but I'd have to look more into that.  All in all it was a really fantastic experience. I highly recommend coming here for your running needs!

Scott's smoothies are phenomenal!   I've yet to try any of the monsters but I've had the banana bread and the PB&J before. They're so filling. My boyfriend loves the strawberry banana. The salads look pretty tasty; definitely on my "to try" list.  Scott (the owner) has always been super friendly whenever we've gone, so I question the previous reviewers assumption. Sounds like a lot of guessing there...  You won't go wrong with mojo bowl. For $5 you're getting a meal in a cup!

I'm a smart girl, but always weary of car shops after being ripped off by reputable places in the past. These guys were great. Incredibly friendly, speedy, and efficient. They only sold me what I *really* needed versus pressuring me into replacing all 4 tires. I'll be back here the next time I need tires for sure. Plus, there's a little discount when you pay cash. Every cent counts!

Jodi is the best. I can't imagine going anywhere else now that I've found her! She is incredibly thorough with her cut and color and ensures that she understands exactly what you want. I've never been so happy walking out of a studio before. She is super sweet and personable too...an all around great experience! Love the online booking!
