I am so frustrated. I went in to get the foundation that I usually do. However, I could not remember the shade so I knew I would have to try it on. After looking at a couple different shades, a lady wearing a "Lancôme" apron asked if I wanted to test some colors and I agreed. With my brand in hand she walked me to the Lancôme section and I already knew she would try to upsell me. She half A$$ed the application of my brand with a shade that was too light and showed me and obviously I didn't like it. So she said "lets try this one" and began to apply what I thought would be a darker shade. Turns out after the big reveal it was a Lancôme foundation (shocker) I did like it better but I asked her the cost. She told me it was $25 and my original brand was $29. So naturally I chose the Lancôme as it looked better and was cheaper. Getting to the register turns out it was $45 dollars. I told the lady at the register that I had been misinformed and now I didn't know what color I needed of my original brand. Thankfully they were nice in trying to accommodate me and long story short I stuck with the Lancôme for the sake of the price (my original brand required a specific brush for application). I took it home and tried it this morning and it is NOT the right color at ALL. My face is literally a different color than the rest of my skin and it looks TERRIBLE. I was frustrated, but now I am angry that after all that its not the right color. Such a bad experience and now I have to go back to face them again to get the right product!

The guy was pretty standoff-ish and talked to me like I was stupid. I know what I'm doing, I've applied for a passport before. He took my picture for my passport and while they were printing, he ran my card, $20 for pictures. TWENTY. and when he handed them too me, they were faded and poor quality. I'm probably going to have to get more taken. I was so mad I just left. A waste of $20. I should have done my research before hand, Costco does them for FIVE DOLLARS and you get FOUR copies!

I always forget about this place! I need to frequent it more often! Always great food, clean restaurant and relaxed atmosphere. I had a mistake with my order and the employees were so accommodating, the manager even came and brought me my new pizza. EXCELLENT example of customer service, I was very impressed.

SUPER YUMMY! I'm not eating for days!  Peach lemonade is divine!! The one downside was the employees reacted as if they've never served someone with allergies before... My sister cannot have dairy and she told the server that multiple times, they brought the pulled pork out with no bun for her but brought her an ear of corn slathered in butter. The manager was super quick to get involved and get her a new one which was great, no harm done just be aware if you do have allergies to ask and ask again! Overall great experience really fun atmosphere and out of this world food!  Can't wait to go back!

I'm not one to complain, I'm in the service industry, so I know bad days happen. This was worthy of others knowing. My service rep literally LIED to me. He quoted me for an oil change and I let him know about the radio having some issues. Wrote down the quote on the paper, gave me the yellow carbon copy. When I came to pick up my car, there was an extra $100 tagged to the bill. The guy then told me it was for inspecting the radio. I then told him he NEVER said it would be $100 to LOOK for the problem. He then assured me that he did and even quoted me that price. Unfortunately, like a dummy, I didn't have my copy. I continued to argue that we never would have had them check out the radio if we would have been told it cost that much. I understand that it costs money to inspect things, but we were never told ahead of time and he then lied saying he told me that. Thankfully, he took off the $100 (probably because he knew he was wrong) He said he didn't want to lose my business...too late. I came home to look at my receipt and sure enough, he had added the "1" to his copy...my quote was for $100 less. I won't tolerate being lied to.

Haven't been here in over two years and we were looking at some jeeps. Worked with Mark V. Who was absolutely wonderful! True example of customer service! My husband and I aren't ready to buy at the moment, but our experience with Mark definitely has us wanting to come back when we are ready to purchase!

My husband and I got  tattoos of a bible verse on our wrists. Bob was absolutely wonderful! He was so willing to work with us and give us something WE wanted, but still make it something that would be really good quality and last forever. I really appreciated that he wanted to make sure the tattoo looked good for a very long time but still make sure it was a tattoo that we loved and true to our desires. These were our first tattoos and they all made it a great experience! They are all very kind and EXTREMELY talented artists! Just seeing the other peices being done at the same time, they were incredible!!

Ordered some take out today for me and a colleague and long story short our order got messed up. It happens, I totally understand that! What turned my experience around was the recovery, it's all about the recovery! As soon as the manager/owner recognized that I had been waiting, he got involved. Not only that, but the employees were apologetic, sincere and gave me a voucher for a free entree! Way to make what could have been a bad experience a good one! Our order wasn't 100% correct but at that point I know they were trying to just get it to me, which I appreciate! I will definitely be back, customer service like that is hard to find!

I had the most wonderful experience today! This salon is so different from the moment you walk in the door! You don't feel like just another head of hair! The moment I came in they offered me water and tea and the receptionist was so friendly! Cristina did my hair and did an AMAZINGLY job! I have her complete control, telling her I wanted something new and fresh! I don't even know how many inches we cut off ( she estimated 12!!) but the whole time she made sure I was comfortable and she was so professional! I absolutely LOVE my hair and can't wait to show everyone! I live in North Scottsdale and today's service and product make it worth the drive!

We had an amazing experience here! Wonderful service and even better food! We live in the neighborhood and have always wanted to try this place and we were so happy we finally did! The manager came to our table and was so friendly! He bought us dessert for our anniversary, and it was to die for! A dessert calzone, Nutella, banana and a sugary crust! Heaven! Cannot wait to go back!

New favorite restaurant! The location is so stinkin cool and the food is unbelievable!! I could have drank the salsa... The staff there is just phenomenal, everyone treats you like you are a regular, so friendly and when the ask if you need something or how the food is, it's like they REALLY care! Seriously. You can tell they all care about their jobs and care about their customers. Love this place and can't wait to go back!

I am so disappointed with this location. My mom and I have been coming here for years. They have really gone down hill. Mainly their customer service. Everyone there is so snobby and rude. I came in with a pile of clothes in great condition and they took absolutely nothing. Not one item. They didn't even say why, the lady just pointed to my stuff and said, "We don't want anything." Apparently Ann Taylor and White House Black Market isn't what they're looking for. So disappointed. I will be looking to consign elsewhere.

Yum. Just yum. There is no way anyone could go here and NOT find something they like! So many options and everything is so good! The waitress informed me that you can order their homemade bread... Can I please have one loaf for every day of the year? Heavenly!! The customer service was really great as well! The only reason I didn't give them five stars was the restaurant itself was a little grungy and needed some attention to detail as far as cleaning. Everything else was incredible, I cannot wait to go back!

Fun decor and atmosphere!! Casual ambiance with familiar foods done in a sophisticated way. I just have two words for you, butter cake. To this day, the best dessert I have ever tasted. It was such a great place to celebrate my birthday and I can't wait to go back! Especially for that butter cake...

I am absolutely in love with this gym! I signed up for the 30 day challenge and I'm on day 15 and could not be happier. They are so encouraging and always push you to be the best you can be. I really enjoy how there are people working at all levels. There are people who are just starting out and others who are extremely fit athletes. Regardless of your experience and fitness, everyone comes out being challenged and stronger. All of the coaches are so helpful and make sure you are doing the workouts properly and safely. Scott is extremely patient, engaging and truly cares about your success. I cannot wait to finish out the month and I hope to continue my fitness journey with TruHit!

This eclectic little place would never have been one that a picked myself. My friend bought a groupon and we went together and I am so glad that we did! It was such a wonderful experience! I really felt like they care about YOU and you're not just another wallet walking in their door. I wish this gem was closer to where I live because their customer service is out of this world!

Nom nom nom. Have you had the spicy sweet potatoes? So good! Great place to grab a healthy meal. It is on the pricey side for the portion sizes especially. I really enjoy eating on their patio! Overall good restaurant!

We had an wonderful dinner here! Lettuce wrapped tacos were delicious and so nice that they have that available! The pork carnitas are fantastic! What really stood above it all was the margaritas! The absolute best margaritas I have ever had!! I guess they make them in a Bellini machine so they're super smooth and yummy! Cannot wait to go back for happy hour!

I absolutely cannot wait to come back here! My only complaint is that we don't live closer! However, my husband and I both agreed it's better there's some distance otherwise we would probably be back more than our bank account can afford!  We started with the smoked wings which were really great, some heat and some sweetness. Great combination. I had the sweet potato black bean burger. I don't have adequate words to describe how delicious it was!! So much flavor in one patty! I wish so badly I could make something like this at home. I especially loved that it was crispy on the outside!  My husband had the "mother of all burgers" and said it was the best burger he's ever had!  Emily was simply fantastic as our server. I really appreciated how knowledgable she is about the products she is serving, both food and drink alike. She is an incredible asset!  Needless to say we had an incredible experience and are thrilled to have this restaurant in the Phoenix area! We hope to try the brunch soon!

Received a phone call at noon that they were canceling our reservation because of staffing. On Valentines Day. No efforts to get me to come back, won't even answer the phone. Looks like they won't ever be getting our business. Happy Valentine's Day to us, looks like we're ordering pizza.

Best BBQ I've ever had. I haven't even tried their sauce because the meat is just so good without it, I don't want to ruin it! I cannot wait to go back! The customer service is phenomenal as well. I am so happy to have a place that doesn't cook their food in BBQ sauce because my husband doesn't like it! It's nice to have a place we can both enjoy! I cannot stress how much I enjoyed this place!

This place is so much fun! I wish I could remember the name of our server, he was absolutely fantastic! I even forgot my dessert at the table and he chased us out the door to bring it to us! It was very busy but definitely fun to be able to play ping pong while we waited for our table! The only down side is that it is on the pricey side and as good as the food is, I'm not sure it's worth the amount we spent. Will probably go back for drinks and apps!

This place was so wonderful!! From the atmosphere, to the service, to the food! I cannot wait to go back. For those who like Bloody Mary's (not a personal fan) they have the most extensive Bloody Mary bar I have ever seen!!! They have every garnish you could ever think of! Definitely try to go before 10am on the weekend, that's when the crowds really hit! I just can't say enough about this place!  New favorite for sure!

This place was absolutely amazing!! The original restaurant we had reservations at for Valentine's Day cancelled on us...Turned out to be a good thing because we ended up here!! What an amazing restaurant, from the ambiance to the service. They were very very busy being a holiday and the server did not skip a beat. Even when I found that they had run out of my favorite kind of dessert, he not only took care of our dessert, but brought me chocolate ice cream for my "chocolate craving." So thoughtful! We absolutely loved this place and cannot wait to go back!
