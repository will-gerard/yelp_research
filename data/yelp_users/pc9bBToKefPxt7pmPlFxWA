Staff doesn't seem to be awake. Burger was saturated with grease, bottom bun soaking in grease. They didn't get my shake on the order and after reminding wait staff 3 times about it, I finally got the shake when I was about finished with my food. Tasted like they poured it out of a McDonald's machine. Asked them to take it off the bill, which took another 10 minutes to get out new bill. Frys were unseasoned.  We absolutely will not be giving this food joint a second chance.
