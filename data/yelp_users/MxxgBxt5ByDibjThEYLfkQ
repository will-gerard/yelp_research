So I have been a food rut and haven't really been inspired to want to try to make something at home. But Chef Pete has totally blown me away with EVo. I don't even know where to start.  Well first the must have drinks are Grapefruit Basil if are looking for something tarte and refreshing but the John mule its all the right notes if you are looking for a little sweet and a favor you just can't pin point. For Apps: MUST get the Spiced Pork Belly- if you love watermelon salad this take you to a totally different world great texture, right amount of spice, and the home made pickle watermelon rinds.. the well season super tender pork.I can get this all day and just thinking the salty and the crisp sweet watermelon mmmm The raviolo- is this huge homemade truffle ricotta goodness with the cuper crisp bacon bits to give the salt you need.   Totally something I never had before was their beef heart sandwich which has this amazing homemade mustard seed. My fellow elite Jody favorite was the  EVo salad and i love it just as much but the brussel sprout leave were charred to perfection and the micro pear bites was such a better idea then when you get those large slices that you would have to cut.  We also had the chicken thigh and bone marrow, equally really good if you are looking for comfort food.   After all this yes we still shared two pasta dishes! How can you not- they all homemade too. If you are looking spicy you have to get the squid ink pasta- its creamy with a hint of uni favor but the pasta is cooked to perfection and then you get hit with a little heat of spice after every bite, it not too spicy as you keep going so you end up eating the whole thing and realized you forgot to get a bite of the huge crab chunks.  The Fadellini- that classic clam sauce with a twist and it was a lighter version with these beautifully made pasta.  Price point- we under price for the quality and service you are getting here as some of these dishes in Chicago or NYC would be much higher so totally worth checking out.    Great play on texture, hitting all favors of salty, sweet, sour, etc in each dish and honestly hard to bored.

So just wanted to see if I can score on a designer things and I walked out with pretty much all brand new items. So this place is a halfy- new clothes things in front and consignment in the back.  I scored on the cutest $10 black short. I had on alot of dresses but the owner suggested something I seriously would never dare to wear because of my naturally large chest but I loved. I loved it so much she recommended a strapless bra  from Nordstrom so i thought I give Nordstrom a shot- Well believe it or not the Wacoal strapless bra is hands down the best strapless for  large chest that have breastfeed.  So of course I wore my new outfit 2 hours later for a night of with my friend including my new favorite statement necklace that I also got which was a silver horn. I also got an open choker that she recommended that i am planning to wear as soon as I get back to Chicago with an outfit in mind. The new clothes are totally my style if you are looking for a little hippy, rocker, trendy, that is comfy that you can throw on and feel amazing with little effort.  If you are fan of bauble bar.. go here first because it is seriously I think the same item for less and all very well hand pick.

Great spot to people watch but honestyl the ice coffee was amazing.. nicely roasted and the bean already had a hint of sweetness that I didnt even need sugar, Just a little creamy. I also got the smoke salmon bagel and that was really good too and just gave me a great start to my morning.

The pieces are seriously way to new to believe this is a consignment store. If you are a size 8 shoe this might be heaven for you. 6.5 had a smaller selection but still good.  Alot to look at and the hang bags are all gorg. Price wise- it is pricey but seriously there is barely a mark on anything even some of the sole of the shoes! I didnt find anything I had to have but when I am back in town they will be on my places to go list.

Came here for lunch since I was working in the area. I was craving pasta so I got  the carbonara and my co worker the chicken sandwich. I wish I switch because the pasta was just super doughy( cooked) and the cream sauce was overcooked as it was separating on the spot. To top it off, the Bacon was way to salty and it was just a mess as the egg on top was just too much and not needed if the sauce was that rich already.  three bites and i was done,
