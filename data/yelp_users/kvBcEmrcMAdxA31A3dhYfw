I found these guys on yelp and have been very satisfied with the service.  The office is clean, organized and friendly.  I needed a ride home after dropping my car off, and they provided shuttle services and even picked me up from work when my car was ready. My brakes were squeaking noise, and I couldn't tolerate the sound.  I was on the verge of going insane.  They fixed my brake, and found out what was causing the noise (brake pads, and calipers were installed wrong). They were good at communicating and honest throughout the entire process.   The price was fair for the time and efforts. I just left the shop and my brakes are now working like new... and another auto-shop may have elected to do an entire brake job.  I will definitely be bringing my car back here for future service.

Not very good, this was probably some of the worst indian food I've had.  (I've been pretty spoiled)  At one point there was something that was hard in my food and I cringed when I bit down.  I'm not sure what it was.  I'm used to very well flavored Indian food, and the curry was bland. The service was good, and it was inexpensive, but I think I'll try some other local places first before returning.

Whenever I'm up for a game of pool, Clicks is only a short drive away.  There is always a table available and a tasty inexpensive draft beer to be had.  The staff is always attentive, and the specials are worth showing up for.  Even the food is okay after a few drinks.  6/25/11 Drove by clicks the other day and it is now closed...

I always enjoy going here, the coffee is always great and the owner is super nice.  I always stay a little longer and chit chat with her.  In a big city,  its the people who work in small cafes like this that keep me coming back.  I love seeing the same face!

I always find myself over here before, during, and after a concert at the Clubhouse.  I've even gone to watch my Boston teams on the big screen.  The owner is from Boston and a big time fan.  Overall, drinks are cheap, food is okay, but I always feel comfortable and at home here, lots to do.

This place was great,  they found space for our huge group of 25 people, and were able to get us all feed, and happy even though we kind of took the place over.  I was impressed with the food and have been meaning to return for some more menu sampling and of course so fine Italian desert....

I always stop over here when I'm in Tempe,  you can't be the prices! The hummus, gyro, tabouli have all been great.  My friend and  usually waiter, Ali even convinced me to try the Turkish coffee, that was good.  The baklava counter is always irresistible at checkout.  I'm going to have to visit soon.

I drive by this place on my way to work every day and their parking lot is often full. I was curious to see what the fuss is about, so I purchased a groupon.  My boyfriend and I walked over there for dinner one night and were hoping for some really tasty food.   We were seated promptly and our server was very friendly, our water glasses were kept full and our food arrived fast.  The atmosphere was nice, candlelight, with nice chairs. I don't like to feel pressured into buying wine, beer or cocktails, and our waiter seemed a little pushy on that front... He almost seemed surprised and annoyed we weren't ordering drinks.  But the main complaint I have is the the food was not very good.  We ordered chips and salsa, and the salsa was bland, kind of tasted like one of those 99 cent cans of salsa from food city.  I ordered a grilled chicken burrito.  I guess I should have studied  the fine print on the menu more.  The server asked if I wanted shredded, grilled, or crispy chicken. I asked for grilled and that added $2.95.  He then asked what sauce I wanted on top, red, green etc.  cha-ching another $1.95.  Not to  be the master of complaining here,  but my $12.95 burrito was now a nearly $18.00 burrito.  I know I had the groupon,  but the point is I should love an $18.00 burrito.  I should go home, think about it, dream about, tell me friends about the best burrito in town, and try to mimic the ingredients to create my at home version.  The chicken was dry, the $1.95 red sauce tasted bland, I kept wishing for some hot sauce.  The burrito was suppose to include some passion fruit sauce... there was nothing passionate about the fruit sauce, I don't think it was even in the burrito.  It was just kind of a bland sloppy mess. My boyfriend ordered the pork verde enchiladas, and I tried them.  They seemed alright.... I gave him my burrito and he who is in the clean plate club, did not eat it.   Our bill was $40.00 for two dinners and a order of chips and salsa.  The groupon helped, but even for $25.00 I felt like the food was sub par.  Anyway,  I can walk here in 3 mins flat, and I have not returned.

This place is awesome!  Real authentic Greek food.  I grew up with two Greek uncles and the food here reminded me of the meals we used to share.   The price was very reasonable and the owner is super friendly!!!!  I can't wait to go back!

Super friendly staff, and a great gyro.  I'd like to go back and try a few more items,  I went in late night, and was the only person there, but they chatted me up and made me feel at home.

I  went here twice over All Star weekend, as we were searching for something not commercial and a little bit more low-key.  We found Hanny's and were pleasantly surprised.  The pizza was good and filling,  the snack plate was perfect with a martini.  Overall, the staff was friendly, and attentive, the prices were reasonable and the food, well it was pretty good.  I didn't walk out of there feeling like we got hosed like I had a couple nights ago at the Tilted Kilt....

I love this place,  always a good crowd of people, and good price.  I always get a fresh Thai coconut, the spring rolls, and some pho.  I often bring friends and they love it.   I'd go more often if it were closer.

I always enjoy the concerts here, and the food is good.  I am sometimes disappointed with the service.   Everyone is super friendly,  but they forget to bring the drinks we ordered and we end up going to the bar to get them...  6/25/11  I still go to the Compound often, as the selection of live musical act seen here are second to none in the Phoenix area.  However, I continue to be disappointed in the service, and food. Last time I was there my sister had a taco, and the fish was bad.... how can you serve up bad fish? My other sister ordered some soup and they just did not bring it, they left and she had to go up to the bar and ask for her food.  When we were seated and waited about 30 minutes before anyone acknowledged us... I had to say kind of loudly, "looks like we have no waiter" and someone finally came over to us... the place was dead... and they ignored us, a table of 5....  The staff is friendly but they just do not get good customer service.. and if your going to charge for top quality food, make sure it is infact top quality, and most importantly fresh...  I will keep frequenting the Compound like I said I love the music,  but they really need to do something about the service.  I've been there maybe 20 times, and it is often very poor....

Visited this place for the first time, and was very happy with my food.  I loved my chicken mole taco, and my mahi mahi taco.  Portions were huge and I ended up making two tacos out of each that I bought.  Mexican food is everywhere here in Phoenix, but this one hit the spot with great flavors, and an awesome fresh salsa bar.

Went again tonight with my sisters and we shared a few tacos... great service, the waitress was super friendly, and although she was the only one there was attentive.  We ordered a burro to go, and she packed it nicely with a bag of chips.  We finished out this meal with some flan, and having had what I thought was great flan in Mexico, I was pretty impressed!

This place was awful.  I had heard people talk about the Tilted Kilt as a great place to grab a drink, and a good bite to eat.  Well it was All Star weekend and I suppose I could give them a break.  But...I can't  if you are really busy chain restaurant that just opened you can't have service sooo poor.  We were ignored for awhile, finally a waitress came,  our food took over an hour and when it came it was cold.  I had a bean burrito, it was overly salty, cold,  and even though I was super hungry,  I couldn't bare to eat it.   It came with sweet potato fries that were still frozen in the center.  All of this for like $12.00.... place is kind of a rip-off, and since I am a female,  the girls in short skirts, and big boobs doesn't make up for crap food, and crap service.  The waitresses tried to be nice, but I think someone is training them to be overly annoying,  they sit down at our table to take our order and kept talking to us...  I didn't really understand that.....
