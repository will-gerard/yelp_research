If I could give this place a -5 star rating, I would. Went here last week to get my tongue pierced.. I usually go to Love & Hate Tattoo for EVERYTHING. But for some reason, I let a friend talk me into going here.. BAD DECISION!! All of the employee's there were not very personable at all. Jose pierced me. It was extremely fast. Didn't talk me through anything and completely skipping over the healing process and how to take care of it.. A few days later, my tongue began to bleed NON STOP for a good 10 minutes.. The swelling still had not gone down either. I called the next morning and he didn't seem concerned AT ALL. So.. I went 2 more days. The exact same thing happened, this time my tongue was extremely tender. The next morning I called my normal, trustworthy shop Love & Hate, where the pierced had me come in, took one look at it and said, "How the hell did he fuck your tongue up so bad!? Don't ever go there again!" I had to get it removed that day. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. They need to stick to tattooing.. but I haven't heard very many good things about that either for them.. This shop is a JOKE. Jose - I really hope for the sake of others, you never do another piercing ever again. Thanks for the waste of time and money and potentially getting an infection.

I'm not usually one to eat at places such as El Pollo Loco.. Especially with my eating habits and their lack of options for me. Anyways.. my coworker and I stopped by for lunch (because it's close to work and I was out of time). I got a $5 bowl (just beans and rice), which tasted fine, for the most part, she got the street tacos.   They gave us some salsa with our order: 2 red, 2 green.. The green was tasty but the red on the other hand I'm sure was rotten.. The containers with the red salsa in them were bloated and ready to explode, which led me to believe they were no good. Sure enough, they exploded upon opening and the smell was awful and so very sour. It was disgusting. Definitely threw those away!  Needless to say, my stomach and my coworkers stomach is upset, 3 hours after consuming less than half of our food. My food had pico de gallo on it, so due to the way I feel, I'm guessing the tomatoes in the pico were bad as well.   Guess that's why I choose NOT to go here normally.. of course the one time I do, I get sick. Thanks, crazy chicken. You can keep your rotten tomatoes and sour salsa, jerks.

Finally tried Four Peaks out last night for date night! It was a little loud but the atmosphere is cool - I love how it's open and the brewing tanks are exposed! There's nothing like going to a brewery and actually feeling like you're IN a brewery!   For our appetizer, we ordered the Thai Hummus plate. That hummus was seriously some of the BEST hummus I've ever had! Next for our entree, we ordered the Veggie Beer Bread to share (such a huge portion!). The bread was so soft and yummy and the veggies inside were sauteed/seasoned to perfection and oh so tasty!   I'm already a fan of their Hot Knot, so naturally I ordered that. It tasted sooooo much better getting it right from the source!  I definitely recommend this place for all you crafty beer lovers!

Finally getting around to reviewing the tasty, Green!   Parking is kind of crazy, but totally worth the hassle! It's a quaint cute little spot and has a super cute patio! The girls working there that took our order were super polite and helpful.  They offer lots of different varieties - YAY!! (It's hard to come across good vegan places with variety like this, so that itself is refreshing!) Anyway, I ordered the Diablo Red bowl with tofu which was absolutely delicious and SO much food! They also serve local craft beer (Four Peaks), which is always a plus in my book! I'd say the prices were pretty normal for a place like this.. Expect to pay $7 - $10 per plate.  I definitely recommend this place and will be going back!

First time at Carly's Sunday afternoon after visiting Radish at the Desoto Market!  After enjoying a $7 IPA and a $10 cocktail at Desoto... we decided we wanted a decently priced Bloody Mary. So, my roommate suggested Carly's. I guess they used to have $4 BM's on Sunday's? But that has changed to $6 now when you buy 2. Not bad since they add lots of garnish (if you're a veg head, make sure to ask for no meat or cheese).   We also ordered the hummus trio which came with red pepper & regular hummus & this olive Tapenade (which is to die for!) served w/grilled flat bread & terra chips for $8.  Next, we ordered a Beermosa to share with a shot of Bourbon (for an extra $2)! I definitely recommend it! Super strong and worth the $$!   Needless to say, after that trip to Carly's I left with a full tummy and had a good buzz going on! I can definitely see myself coming back for some drinks and their vegetarian options!

Most of us, still drunk from the night before ventured out to find the hangover cure, aka pho and stumbled upon this little place, Pho Thanh...  Upon first impression, the place was packed (good sign!), very clean and full of employees cleaning off tables. We seated ourselves and someone came to our table right away to take our drink orders..  I was more than thrilled to discover that they had a section in their menu just for vegetarians (no scanning through the whole menu to find veg options)! While everyone else was ordering their pork spring rolls, shrimp spring rolls and pork pho... I went with the Cuon Chay which is the fresh vegetable spring rolls with imitation shredded pork and the Canh Chua Chay which is a sweet & sour tamarind soup. Beautiful presentation and such an impact of flavor! Portions are HUGE. I took more than half of my bowl of soup home! I enjoyed every single bite. My meat eating friends enjoyed their dishes as well! First time trying pho for me, (vegan pho at that!) and it was DELICIOUS! They had all kinds of authentic drinks too, which I thought was really neat! Can't wait to try the soy milk they make in house!

First time officially going out for Tiki drinks - and Hula's is definitely the place to go for a good, cheap, local tiki cocktail!  If it's cool enough to sit outside and enjoy the patio - I highly recommend it. Inside can be a bit crowded and noisy like a cafeteria..  Moving onward - during happy hour, most tiki drinks are only $5! And they have some yummy food on special too! (The spicy edamame was delicious.)  While we were there, we got the Dr. Funk, Painkiller, Zombie and the One-Eyed Pyrat. They were all great but the Dr. Funk and the Zombie were definitely my fave! The presentation of the drinks is awesome too. Each drink comes in a tiki mug to match the theme of your drink; so fun! Now I know why so many people are into tiki cocktails! I think I may be a new fan!  From what I hear and have seen, they have a pretty good dessert menu! I definitely gotta try a piece of their Coconut Cream Pie next time! ;)

Centre Pointe is amazing and has been my go to salon for the past several months now. Everyone there is so nice and the atmosphere is clean, professional and super classy! Don is the greatest, I absolutely adore him!! I've never left unsatisfied! It can be a little pricer than other salons, but it's absolutely worth it for the quality of service and products! I refuse to go anywhere else!

Came here for the first time after reading the reviews Saturday night..   Upon first impression - the air outside smelt AMAZING (which enticed me even more to go in), it was a quaint little place but rather clean and we were greeted right away by the nicest young lady that works there. She let us seat ourselves and grabbed our drink orders. If you like New Castle, I recommend trying the Ethiopian Amber Beer that they have. It was pretty tasty!  We shared the Vegetable Combo plate (which is a taste of everything made out of veggies), it was very good, super flavorful and tons of food! Definitely easily shared between 2 or 3 people! The cabbage and potatoes, mushrooms and red lentils were probably my favorite.  Towards the end, it started getting busy, so we had to wait several minutes for our check, but everything else made it a pleasant experience. Really no complaints about this place.. There was only the one girl working the tables, so the wait was totally legitimate.

Firstly - They are not very attentive to waiting customers even though the place is no bigger than 10x10... I had to ask where my food was after waiting for about 15 minutes. The price for the guacamole and chips is overrated for the tiny bit of guacamole that you actually get. The tacos weren't bad. The chicken tacos were sweet (which was weird) and the beef taco was a bit salty for my taste.. I might be up for giving them a second chance based on the other reviews, but my first impression was horrible.

Finally checked this place out! Not once, but twice! Yeah, it was THAT good. And I'd go back!  Super cute and quaint with a homey and cozy atmosphere in the heart of the Grand Ave art district.   They recently switched from vegetarian to 100% vegan! There's lots of gluten free options as well!  On my first visit, we ordered the Nopales Like Home with coleslaw (because they were out of their awesome potato salad) and the Jake the Snack nachos. The jackfruit barbacoa in the Nopales Like Home was delicious and the nopales were cooked to perfection. The nacho "cheese" on the nachos was so yummy and flavorful. Everything was perfect.  During my second visit, we ordered the Avo Sando and the Secret Wonder Bat, both with potato salad. The pesto on the Avo Sando is out of this world. I need the recipe! The Secret Wonder Bat is probably the closest thing you'll ever get to a Reuben. I was so surprised by how much it actually tasted like a Reuben! SO GOOD! Oh, and the potato salad... amazing!  Groupon has a good deal for Bragg's too, which was nice!   Service wasn't anything special.. but who likes to be bothered every 5 minutes when you're trying to enjoy a meal out? Honestly, I can't wait to go back and try more of their sammies and breakfast stuffs! It's worth it for the food, especially for the quality/freshness of it.

This place is AWESOME! Especially if you're vegetarian/vegan!  I don't eat cheese or meat, so having the opportunity to load up on veggie toppings without any extra cost is so great and so worth it!! Their ingredients are always fresh and they offer fresh basil too (yum)! The pizza is always cooked to perfection too. They have a pretty decent craft beer selection also, which is always a plus!! :D   Definitely recommend this place.

I've been to Mother Bunch on 3 separate occasions now.  (Based on my first and second experience, I would've rated this place 4 stars.. but my vote went down to 2 stars unfortunately after the last visit.)  The first went well, enjoyed the vegetable pate and a few different beers.   The second visit was strictly for the beer and location, which also went well..   The third visit, was well.. a disappointment. I took my mom here for their brunch special ($10 for food and a 10 oz. beer - not bad!) Saturday around noon. We ordered a flight of 4 beers that we literally waited 15 minutes or so to receive.   Finally got our order in of the Chilaquiles WITHOUT chicken. I specifically and politely asked for no chicken because I am a vegetarian and do not eat meat.. So, when we finally got our food 20 minutes later, there was chicken in it.. which I didn't realize until I took a bite of my food because it was buried under everything.. Needless to say, I spit it out and had to send my food back.   Now, I know the food wasn't the waiters fault, he was actually awesome when I told him about the issue, but the amount of time it took for everything was ridiculous.   I love the beer Mother Bunch brews and has on tap, the location is great and the atmosphere is laid back but their lack of attentiveness and speediness really hinders my opinion on them and any decision for a  future visit.   I was definitely let down. Maybe it was just a bad day?

First time going to a rotating sushi bar!  Upon first impression - I was definitely surprised by the cleanliness and all the variety and freshness of it.  Prices on the belt range from $1.75 - $6. The plates are color coordinated, so there's really no confusion! They also have a full menu you can order separate dishes off of that isn't priced bad either.  There are a few vegan/vegetarian options on the revolving sushi belt too, which I thought was cool.  We got the Edamame, Asparagus Roll, Sweet Potato Roll, this bean curd thing that is not featured on the menu (it was good though!) and a plate of vegetable Yaki Soba noodles (from the menu). All of which was very good! Our total was under $20 for 2 people!  The service isn't the greatest, but you ARE pretty much serving yourself, so it wasn't a huge deal. All the servers there were very nice and always keeping up tables/sushi belt.  I recommend it and would definitely go back.

Super yummy AND healthy!! Be RAD and eat at Radish! :D  I love all of their options and fresh, colorful ingredients.Such clever, fun names too! I hear the employees have part in naming their dishes - so cool!  Glory and Erik are amazing and so helpful!! Glory made my salad to perfection and served it with the best smile!   I ordered the vegan/gluten free salad, Gnarles Parsley. Such a good choice and clever name. All the ingredients blended so nicely together. And for the small order, it was still a lot of food!  I can't wait to go back and try their juices!! Keep being awesome, Radish!

Such a cool concept! Valley Bar is like a modern day speakeasy!  The dim lit atmosphere adds to the whole vibe of the place. Plenty of seating areas, lots of standing room for shows, super cold AC and plenty of free games to play! So much fun!! With it being in an alley way though, I highly recommend getting an Uber or biking down there!   Also, the kitchen food is from Short Leash and they just happen to have some pretty sweet vegan options! The vegan chili fries are to die for!   They have some good beers on tap there too! Decently priced. Beers are the same prices as the beer at Crescent Ballroom, so that's nice.

Finally got to try this place out! With it being so close, it's PERFECT to bike to and I love how they have a bike map! :D  These are the beers I tried: - Senor Gallo (ABV of 5.1) - for those of you who like lighter lagers, this is for you!  - Jolene Ginger Pale Ale (ABV of 4.5) - Different, but I liked it. Super gingery, so if you're not a fan of ginger, don't try this.  - Jomax (ABV of 6.9) - Coffee Wheat Stout.. YUM!! Loved it. Got a whole growler to take home! - Wren House IPA (ABV of 6.8) - Yay for hops! Not too hoppy, just right. Nice and refreshing. Can't wait to take home a growler of this bad boy!  Heard they have food trucks that come around 4pm. Looking forward to going back to fill up my growler and getting closer to my $1 fill up! Fill up a growler 9 times and get the 10th fill for a $1! Who doesn't like beer rewards?
