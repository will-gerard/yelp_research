Things I like about this place  The all you can eat beef ribs are fun.  The family style salads.  The view/location.  Best view in the city.  The building is awesome.  The bull, the slide, the multi level floor plan is really cool.  Things I don't like.    I always order the beef ribs but sometimes they are a little fatty, but that goes with the territory.    The band.  I hate the damn band.  That's not the kind of place you to listen to live music.  It should be at a back round kind of volume.  You can't hear the people at your table talk.  The positives totally out weigh the negatives.

This place is very unimpressive. I don't think it's particularly bad but there is just nothing special about it. It's a chain restaurant so I expect them to have there stuff together as fare as wait time on food and they don't. Been there twice and food was slow both times.   There was nothing special about my French toast. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't good either.

This place isn't bad.  It's just overrated.  It's a little on the expensive side.  They only except cash and I'm always convinced that cash only establishments are run by the mob.    I know many people think this is the greatest place ever but I just don't see it.  I think they like the idea of the place more then the actual food.    Again, it's not just overrated.

We had a lot of fun.  I've taken the tour twice and it was real informative both times.  I highly recommend you check it out.

I give it a 4 star because I compare it to it's competition.  I am not putting it up against an Abuelos or some fancy sit down kind of place.  I am comparing it to Filibertos or Amados or that kind of place.    I am big on breakfast burritos and they have my favorite.  I don't really venture off that section of the menu.

This place is pretty awesome. It's like Disneyland more meat eaters. I especially recommend the rib eye steaks and the beer brats. I sampled the pulled pork and it was really good too. I want to go back and get some of that.    A really cool part is the dog treats. I always pick a pigs ear or something for my puppies.   The only knock on it is that the place isn't cheap. You are definitely paying a premium but it is worth it for sure.

This place is awesome.  Everything that a BBQ joint should be.  I order some type of meat sampler.  I got brisket, pulled pork, and some ribs.  The pulled pork was awesome and everything else was really good.  The sides were all you can eat but I was given so much meat I didn't get any extra.  The drinks are served from a mason jar....nice touch.    The only knock is it's the fanciest most modern place but BBQ wasn't meant to be fancy.

The beer was pretty good.    Pretty cool space and easy parking.    I think the are going for some weird counter culture hipster vibe when they came up with the vision for this place.  It's like they sat around and said "bars that play music so loud that nobody can talk is so conformist and over done....instead we should play weird british movies/tv shows so loud that nobody can talk.  Ya we're so different and cool".

Easily the best donut place in the valley.  No competition.

The building is weird but I dig weird.  Not sure what the building was before but I think re-purposeing old buildings for new businesses is really cool.    I went with a couple people and we tried to order almost everything they had.  I really liked the burger and shakes.  The biggest surprise was spare rib tacos.  I'm usually make boring food choices so I didn't expect to like them but they were really good.  When I go back I will order those.    I see a lot people complaining about the service but I thought the service was very good.

We showed up on a Thursday around 7 o clock, towards the end of their dinner rush.  We were seated and it took the waiter about 5 minutes to greet us.  Being a group of 4 nerdy guys, we would have loved to have been served by one of the many pretty waitresses on staff.........NOPE!!!  We got the one gnarly dude waiter.  Makes sense right?    We ask for the list of the draft beers and he points out this weird faded piece of paper that was almost unreadable.   I couldn't seem to find my favorites on tap but I could get a can so that was no biggy.   We give him our beer orders and it takes about 10 minutes for him to get our beers, that were all out of a can.  So it basically took them 10 minutes to pull the beers out of the refrigerator and bring it to us.  As he gave us our beers he apologized.  This ended up being a theme of the night.  We ordered two more rounds of beers that night and they all took forever to get and he apologized every time.  It ended up being the joke of the table "House of Brews, where every beer comes with an apology."  Good slogan right?  I ordered the prime rib dip and it was good.  I really liked the old school wedge "jojo"  style fries.    With the exception of our sword carrying waiter, the wait staff was very easy on the eyes.    The place has lots of TV's and would be a decent spot to watch a game.
