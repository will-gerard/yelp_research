Plenty of gas pumps and convenient to get some cooked food inside.  If getting gas, caution for enter and exits  at pumps.

Wow, the wait at the drive-thru is painful in the heat!  Even with the air-con.   I don't know if because it was extremely hot and humid that this wait seem to take forever.  But prior to going through the drive-thru, we had parked on the other side of the building and I walked to the other side to use the restroom, taking my casual time.  By the time I returned the same car was still at the drive-thru.  And when we finally made our order and received it, it seemed as though it was too long to wait for a drink.  Take caution:  there are quite a few homeless hanging in the area.

It's unfortunate that I just read poor review of this place, because our experience was totally the opposite.  My husband had been working with the dealer via email's and phone calls on a Little Guy trailer we were interested in on their lot.  We live in Southern California.  The right numbers came up where we were ready to make a purchase. With check in hand we drove out to AZ, not knowing if we were going to get what we saw and read on the ad.  We were greeted by the employee my husband was dealing with.  Before we were, we had saw the Little Guy and did our own walk around inspection and had a couple of questions on some areas.  But we got some reassurance from the manufacturing (via text) that all was OK after sending photos of our concerns.  The Tom's Camperland employee was very helpful and pleasant doing business with, we hope for the same for the next customers.

Best garlic prawns!  Their Thai iced tea, yummy!  Make reservations!  This place gets packed quickly.  Friendly service can't wait to eat there again!

Wow, it's been awhile since we visited this restaurant.  But, we hadn't forgotten about it.  We always thinks about the Garlic Prawns (Chef's Choice).  Since this was an impromptu trip we didn't have a set plan for anything special, except to have Garlic Prawns.  When we reached our hotel we immediately called the restaurant only to find out they are completely booked this evening and tomorrow evening as well. They said it could be up to an hour or more wait.  We decided to chance it since we wanted our guests to try the Prawns. My husband went into the restaurant and place our names on the waiting list.  we decided to cruise the strip thinking we had at least 45 minutes, well, within 20-25 min we got a call saying they are ready for us.  I was thankful we didn't drive further into the strip , we may have lost our spot if we didn't return on time!  To not make this any longer, we got our prawns and we were pleased just like the first time.  Our guests enjoyed it just as much.  We enjoyed the Peking duck curry, yellow curry, nam sod, and fried banana and coconut ice cream for dessert.  Everything was excellent, including the customer service.    Oh, how I long to return already!

Delicious Gelato!  Beautiful and fun decor  and the outdoor patio has a view of a couple of made waterfalls.  I do have to share when sitting out in the patio area it is a bit loud from the waterfalls.  We visited here during the evening so the lighting of the falls was just beautiful.  But, I would love to sit indoors and take in the beauty of the decor.  It also has a large tv screen, there may be another one but I noticed one.    The people were very friendly and read to serve you something delicious.  Everything looked so delicious!  We only had room for our gelato and we shared a plate of tiramisu  dessert.  Both were very good, but the tiramisu was a bit more decadent, with the hazelnut crust, yum.  Now this place is located inside of the Wynn Hotel, so it's a very classy looking place. I can't wait to try something different each time we visit!

At the time we visited this place it was not busy, yet our sushi were made fresh with what tasted like fresh ingredients.  It's more like your fast food type of place.  It is nicely decorated and the service were friendly.  Our order : Teriyaki Salmon Philly Roll Volcano Roll Unage Crunch Roll  If we were in the area and in the mood for sushi we would visit again.  I can't remember all that we ordered but check out the photo's.

Very fun place! There was music going and people line dancing inside.  Before you head inside though, they have outdoor seating for eating.  Indoors, there is plenty of merchandise to make shopping difficult.  So many delicious things.    You place your food order inside.  It was a bit busy when we visited and at checkout it was a bit disorganized.  I would really like to checkout the place again during the day to see everything outside.  And of course to try out some menu items.

This was a good find for us as we were passing through town.  My husband wanted some flavorful but quick food since we had our dog with us.  We had seen the sign for Panda Express and were headed towards it when I eyed Yan's.  We were  very happy that we stopped here.  We entered and were greeted kindly.  Of course we were the only customers at the time. There were a lot of choices on the menu.  They also have a menu on the wall with pictures, which will give you an idea what you are ordering.  We were very pleased with our Twice cooked beef, Shrimp Chow Suey, and Deep Fried (battered) Shrimp.  We ordered a side of white rice to eat with the Twice cooked beef.  The Twice cooked beef was my favorite!.  The employees were very friendly up until the time we walked out the door.  We wouldn't mind stopping by Yan's again to try some new dishes, but for sure I would order the Twice cooked beef again!  WE'LL BE BACK (In Arnold's voice :D)

We were here a couple of years ago, and were pleased with the massage, so we decided to give them a try again.   You still have the cozy feeling when you walk into the place, nicely decorated throughout.   I checked with my husband, and both our massages were very good.  My husbands complaint was the male employees don't seem to keep the prep noise down as the females.  They were dropping the bucket of water down and sliding it across the floor.  Other than that our service was pretty good.  I had Luna and I would request her again if ever in town.

The station is clean, very busy.  We were just driving through the town and stopped here to fill up.  So not sure what customer service is like.

Candy, you are one tough cookie!  But the massage was awesome!  Boy, oh boy my feet were tender, but I knew that I needed that deep massage, it surely worked out my knots.  We came to this spot on the spur of moment decision and luckily they able to work four of us in.  The chairs we sat in for our foot massage were very comfortable.  They have about 10 of these chairs in the one room .   The place looks and smells clean.  The person checking us in was pleasant.  I think because she knew we weren't going to be attended to immediately she asked if we wanted a drink and made sure she communicated with us every now and again letting us know they aren't ignoring us.  I was told from the others I was with that their service was good as well.  We all agreed we would definitely return.

It is probably because the time of day we came in that the donuts were not fresh.  But we were, OK, I was craving some of my favorites.  I selected the three and was only happy with my old fashion donut.  The chocolate one... the chocolate taste wasn't what I am usually used to. The glazed just was too dry.  I will have to go back bright and early in the morning closer to home and do this review again.  What a pain, not, joke only.
