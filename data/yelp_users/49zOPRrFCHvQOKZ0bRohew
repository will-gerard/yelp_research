I ordered take-out a day in advance for a lunch meeting at work. The man who took my order was very helpful and easy to work with, and our order was perfect and so delicious. We got beef, chicken and lamb kebabs, and Greek salad. My co-workers loved it!

Love this place! Tami at the front desk was so helpful when my front bumper was ripped off by rebar sticking up from a curb. She worked with the insurance company and advocated for me; the insurance company ended up paying for the repair. Tami went out of her way to make sure my car was fixed before I had to drive it out of town for the weekend. The Select Auto Body team also thoroughly cleaned the car inside and out (it was dirty); they even took off the headlight covers and de-clouded them. Excellent customer service and excellent work. Thank you!

Two years ago, Select Auto Body replaced a damaged front bumper on my Corolla. They did an excellent job. A couple weeks ago, the paint on that bumper started peeling off. They repaired it for free, giving me a loaner car to use in the meantime, and they even washed the exterior of my car before returning it to me. Great service!

This place has REALLY gone downhill in the last couple of years. I used to love coming here--hosted my 25th birthday here with a group of friends in 2008--but probably won't ever go back. Recently, I tried the chicken tenders and they literally were gigantic McDonald's-style pieces of reconstituted, processed chicken. As someone who loves fried meat and junk food...these just were nasty. Then I tried the ice cream--ordered a single scoop of rocky road to go. I actually dumped half of my serving in the bushes on the way out because it was so bad. Chalky, artificial, not the rich chocolate it should be. Painful. I finished it because I don't like to waste food, but it really was awful. My friend got a root-beer float to go, and it literally took almost 15 minutes to make. Sorry Mary Coyle! I used to love you!

This restaurant literally was a deciding factor when my husband and I purchased a house in the adjacent neighborhood. The staff are so friendly, and the food is so delicious. It's our favorite place. This location is completely separate from other Thai Ramas in the valley--way better than the one in Tempe. Try the angel wings and yellow curry!

Ate here for the first time last night (take out) at the recommendation of a friend. Most families in the place were Chinese--always a good sign. I had to wait about three times as long as the guy said I would for my food to be ready, which was a bummer, but it was delicious and worth the wait. Looking forward to going back!

The website malfunctioned, so my reservation was not properly received. My ride to the airport did not show up, leaving me to scramble for a plan B and nearly miss my flight. The customer-service agent assured me I'd receive a refund. After waiting several weeks, I contacted them again, and they denied my refund.

Everything was great until the event itself, and unfortunately the poor experience at our event overshadowed all of the other good things Heidi's Catering offers (like quick communication, competent administrative staff, tasty food and an excellent banquet manager).  I work for a nonprofit, and we hired Heidi's Catering for our biennial benefit dinner. We hired them based on positive referrals from her past clients (including on Yelp) which is why I was so surprised by our poor experience.   When we met with Heidi weeks before our event, we asked her how she made sure they wouldn't run out of food (we were serving the food buffet style). She pointed to her wall of awards and said, "I didn't get all these awards for nothing." Point taken. But then they ran out of food. At the event, we had well *under* the number of guests we told them we'd have, but we still had about 20 people who didn't get full meals: 14 of those people had no meat or potatoes at all, and many others took very tiny portions of meat and potatoes because they saw the food was running out. This negatively affected our donations because some of our donors were upset that all they got to eat was salad, cooked vegetables and crackers. And dessert.  Other problems that night:  - The servers began clearing the salt and pepper shakers and the napkins while people were still eating--while the program was still going and people were on stage speaking. It was incredibly disruptive, and I could see on the faces of a few guests that they were not pleased. At what restaurant do servers take away your napkin and salt/pepper while you're still eating? The server for my area of the room seemed particularly inexperienced, clunky and unsure of himself--our guests were notably distracted from the program we had designed for them.  - The coffee was served lukewarm and unevenly (only some people at each table were offered coffee).   - We paid for tea service, but the servers didn't offer tea to the guests. I asked for tea because I knew it was an option, and I was given a cup of hot water (no tea). So I had to wait until the server returned and ask again for a tea bag.  - We paid for centerpieces and received lovely candles and fresh flowers. This was mostly nice, except some of the flowers were dead and were sitting in dirty water--I'm guessing they were reused from a previous event(?).  - The desserts were assorted small bites you eat with your fingers. They were very good, but they were served with cocktail napkins featuring a giant "Heidi's Catering" logo. So incredibly tacky--I could not believe they decided to advertise at our event, to our guests, without asking us. I would gladly have paid for plain napkins had I known they would do this.  If you are considering using Heidi's Catering, I would suggest you review the items above with Heidi before your event, to make sure you get what you expect.

Our server was very unfriendly and unwelcoming. I felt like I should have apologized for being there.  The food was very sweet ... the soup, spring roll, garden delight ... all too sweet. Nothing was spicy!  Overpriced for the quality of food and service.   I highly recommend you go to Thai Rama on Camelback if you want good Thai food and friendly service.

Friendly staff--even when our group of 4 asked for split checks. The food is decent. But my big problem with this place is the prices which are about 25% higher than they should be for the food served. I got the Cenpho Sandwich (panini with brie, green apple, bacon and raspberry dressing) and a small side of sweet-potato fries. $12! This should be no more than $9. The food is fine but definitely not outstanding. I would rather save a few dollars and eat similar (but better!) food at he Phoenix Public Market.

Just got home from a friend's bday party at Sidebar, and my ears are ringing and my throat hurts from having to shout in order to talk with my friends. The music was ridiculously loud. I would go back in the future if I knew I'd be able to hear my friends talk...but I probably won't got back. No beer on tap--all bottles--and the margarita was way too sweet/sour. Bummer!

The iced coffee is like a dream. Just as delicious as I remember having in Anlong Veng, northern Cambodia. The beef was much more tender than I expected--so good. Service is a little slow/unattentive by American standards, but you'll just have to chill out and accept it. I love this place!

Worst post office ever. I've never seen more than two people working the counter, and I've never seen fewer than a dozen people waiting in line (this is not an exaggeration). The employees give incorrect information, and they are rude while doing it! Go to Paper Crazy on 12th Street if you need to send something.

Cheaper than Lalibela and perhaps even more delicious! The food is amazing. I shared #5, the beef and lamb combination, with a friend, and we had some left over (and I eat a lot).   We stayed for the traditional coffee, and it was SO great. It takes some time, so don't order the traditional coffee if you're in a rush. My friend, who spent time in Ethiopia, was so happy to have this experience again; it brought back all the memories.  You can munch on fresh popcorn and smell burning incense while the green coffee beans are roasting. They're roasted DARK! Then, the beans ground and freshly brewed in a beautiful pot. Served in tiny cups with or without sugar.  I can't wait to go back to this place!

I showed up with my laptop. Bought breakfast and coffee, left a 70% tip and sat down to work. Opened my laptop but couldn't connect...then an employee told me, "Oh yeah, Macs don't work here." ...Really?! Maybe you could put a sign on the door so I don't waste my money here. Too bad--the place has nice ambience. But I have to say the food is fantastically mediocre.

Recommended by my Afghan friends, consistently delicious, friendly staff, quiet enough to have a conversation, and good prices. I love everything about this place. My only wish is that they'd be open on Sundays!  My recommendations: Chicken Karahi (THE BEST comfort food), Mantoo, and Kabli Pulau (order two skewers of meat per the one plate of rice--that gives you a better meat:rice ratio). Also, the green chatni is good on everything. My dad actually drank it straight from the little plastic cup....

These people saved my bike. I probably would have given up on restoring it had they not been there to help. I have to say I would have appreciated better communication (letting me know my bike wasn't yet ready when I went to pick it up at the scheduled time...twice). Also, note that they only take cash, so bring some with you! But the work was excellent, and the people are honest, reasonable and happy to help. Thank you!

We were one of THREE tables in the restaurant, there were two servers on staff, and the service still was incredibly slow; our server disappeared for so long that the other server came to check on us, and we had to ask for our bill. Our server also was pretty rude. We ordered the monkey bread, which was underwhelming. We also ordered the meatballs, and those were good. The decor of the place is gorgeous, but it doesn't make up for the bad service and mediocre food.

3/4/16: Updating my review to say that while the food here is good, some of the staff make the place unbearable. It's always been sort of a cold/unfriendly environment, but yesterday I had the worst service I've ever had at any restaurant. I actually left because of it, and I'm not sure I'll ever go back. I'm still shocked at how rude the guy was. Just one example: A few minutes after I arrived, and before I ordered food, I was thirsty, so I helped myself to a cup of water from the water dispenser in the dining area. (I'm 8 months pregnant and had just finished a full work day--thought it would be OK to have a drink of water.) On my way to sit down, a staff member came up to me and said he would prefer I use the glasses on the table instead. He actually took my water from me and threw it in the trash can before I could have any of it. Who does that?! This was after a couple of other rude encounters with him, including when I asked him what the $5 nosh plates were, and he said coldly, "They're $5 nosh plates." I laughed, thinking he was making a joke...but he was actually serious and made me sit down before he would give me the menu.... Such a jerk. Sorry, French Grocery, I can no longer toot your horn.  This place is one-of-a-kind. All of the food I've tried (beignets, spinach and cheese criossant, fresh iced tea, cheeses) has been excellent. The prices are reasonable, as well. I enjoyed a spinach and cheese criossant this morning, and it couldn't have been better--it was packed with fresh spinach and just the right amount of cheese. crispy on the outside, warm and soft in the middle. The staff are friendly and helpful; they'll let you sample  the yummy fresh cheeses for sale. The beignets are a fun alternative to doughnuts (they do take about 10 minutes to prepare since they're fresh!). I can't wait until the weather cools off so I can walk here on Saturday mornings. Love it!!

Old review: BEST spinach and cheese croissants in the Valley. Absolutely packed with fresh spinach, a decent amount of mild cheese, and a flaky, fresh croissant. I almost feel healthy eating it....

This place has excellent potential--I hope it succeeds in the competitive market of Central Phoenix coffee shops! Great selection of wine and beer, and I love all the gorgeous art and handicrafts for sale. It's good to know a portion of the money I spend there goes right back into my community. Could use some help with regards to business processes (taking and fulfilling orders, keeping dining area tidy), but hopefully the staff will get a hang of this soon. Looks like this might be my new favorite coffee shop--much less pretentious than Lux and more welcoming than Copper Star!!

I'm not a vegetarian by any means, but I got the veggie breakfast burrito on Saturday, and it was amazing--especially for $4! Very filling and full of all kinds of vegetables--not just onions and the cheap stuff. I had a red-chile pork burrito here several weeks ago, and it also was perfect. I love this place and can't wait to go back! The staff all are very friendly, too.

I was happily surprised to find that Mike, a certified arborist, actually participates in the work of his crew--he doesn't just sell you on his expertise and then pass off the work to someone perhaps less experienced/knowledgeable. He cares deeply about trees, and it shows. Mike was very easy to work with despite his busy schedule. He always arrived when promised, set fair prices and even returned right away to correct an error done the first time. I would recommend him to anybody who really wants their trees well cared for.

Food is decent but overpriced. I got two very small food items and one also-small beer, and it cost me almost $23 including tips. Crazy! The Cajun place is the best out of all of them. Burgers were a huge disappointment according to my two friends who had them--save your money and go to Five Guys instead. Great space but not for eating....
