My new favorite bar in Phoenix! Dress anywhere from Casual to Fancy and you fit in. Two step, hip hop, slow dancing, line dancing. They have everything.   The bar tenders are incredible and take care of you well! TIP EM BIG!!

The Armadillo Grill really surprised me. A dive bar in the midst of all the pretentious restaurants and shopping center around the Baltimore area. A resturant / bar with pool tables and a bunch of tv's with sports. I love dive bars, however, I also like when they grow with the times.  I couldn't imagine coming here to watch a game, because despite their large quantity of TV's they are all too small and cheap in quality.   We came on a Monday night late because a friend of ours has been out of town for a month and we wanted to meet up the SECOND she got back. I had the wings, (I'm sure you are shocked). The size and cooking of the chicken was fantastic, however I'm not a big fan when bars use breaded wings instead of grilled.   The ladies got chopped salads which actually looked phenomenal. I def got 'out ordered'.   I probably will only be back if a buddy wants to meet here, but I certainly can't see myself coming up with the idea to meet here for drinks especially in the Biltmore area where there are just so many other better options.   However, I will say that this place probably has that local, consistent customer base where the same people frequent it on the same night of the week. A total cheers atmosphere for sure. So if you are close and live in the area and are looking for "your dive"...this'll work.

Probably the 2nd best steak I've had. The food is expensive, sure, but thats what you are there for. This is first date, anniversary, birthday type spot. It is a chain yes, and there are probably 'local' spots that I would rather frequent, however you can't deny the quality of the steaks.   The cocktails, wine and drinks have always been solid. I had an amazing Gin Martini with blue cheese olives, a cab with my steak, and an Irish Coffee paired with my bread pudding desert. Everything was delicious.

Fiesta is my place! Ever since I bought my house down the street nearly 4 years ago Fiesta has been a staple in my life. Breakfast burritos on weekends, Cheese only Quesadilla for my 2 little nuggets... AZ burro's and Grande Quesadilla for dinners.   I also love their enchilada meals with a side of Mexi Rice and beans. Everything here is delicious, and breakfast burritos at night...oh mann!!!  Also, if you want something quick or for an appetizer, chips quac and cheese for the win! Can't say enough about it.. Love love love!

If  you have a beer drinking friend in town, this is place to take them! Best bar food in the valley, especially their nachos and spinach dip. Furthermore, some of the best beers I've ever had brewed right here local. Kiltlifter is my all time favorite beer and I'm lucky to live within biking distance. Def a killer spot!

This gem is definitely the place to go for that 'boys' night out for dinner. Single buddy throwing a BDay party? Dinner here first!  Vibe: The atmosphere is straight gangster! Like actually gangster. Durant's is a former hangout of 1930's gangsters. Reason enough to come here. The Bartenders are probably the classiest and best in the valley. Don't tell them a drink, tell them a type of liquor and they will recommend a masterpiece. However, this is the type of place you go to and drink a Glenlivet 18year.   Food: No contest, a top 5 steak in the valley. Their prime rib is probably top 2. Even their $19 burger is delicious, but don't get that.. Get the Rib-eye on your first visit!  The only negative, due to its age, is the bathroom is small and kinda GRO! However, the first time you take a friend, I like to screw with them and tell them the bathrooms are baller and they should check them out... Friends always back confused like I don't know what 'baller' means.

Great coffee, great place / space.  But unless you walk in with black horn rims, laceless chuck taylors, and a plaid shirt with a macbook pro in hand, you'll get eye judged from everyone... Including the staff.   If you visit this place casually, and not exclusively to the point the staff doesn't know you, they act annoyed that you are wasting their time. So what if i like a little sweetener and cream in my iced coffee, I don't need to be eye judged by a twenty-something making $9/hour.  However, I'll just say, it's still my favorite coffee house in Phoenix Metro....just wish they were more accepting of non post-hipsters.

If you're downtown, Carly's is kind of the staple. The first time you go, its absolutely imperative that you play the "interpret the piece of art hanging behind the bar" game. You'll get it wrong, thats not the point, its just a fun game to play.. But be creative about it and not racist.   2nd, Carly's always has some fun live jazz playing, typically just a single saxophonist, maybe a dual or trio tops, but its always nice to have in the ambiance. The people that go to Carly's are awesome, so the crowd is always fun and never full of any pretentious people. Who ever you meet or just sit around will always be pleasant and that is a huge important quality to me when it comes to places to get a cocktail or dinner.   I for one have ironically never actually eaten here, I always end up just doing cocktails after dinner, which I certainly recommend everyone do at least once - but lets be honest. You'll frequent this place.

Meh.   Overpriced, psuedo urban hoity toity experience.   Should you come here at least once and try some house cocktails for $10 each? Sure, why not.   But is this a place to frequent? Not at all, well except phonys. Phonys will love this place. Holden, however would hate it.

I love the SideBar. Not popular enough yet to get too crazy. You definitely want to avoid the crowd by coming on Tuesday or Thursday night...That type of place!  The bartenders are very knowledgeable and totally helpful in recommending cocktails if your feeling laid back and not wanting to pick.   Everyone I've met here is cool as hell and supa friendly. I love places that amazing people and this place accomplishes that to a T.  The couches and hang out areas are comfy, but sitting at the bar and chatting the bartender or my neighbor up is my favorite.

Yogurtland is by far my favorite yogurt shop of all the recent boom in this market. I find their consistent flavors are just that.. consistent. If the seasonal stuff comes in and doesn't tickle my fancy, the regulars are still there and delicious.  However, lets talk seasons. They have the best rotating flavor base around. I especially love their beginning of summer rotation... 12 weeks of decadence.   They FINALLY have a phone app to acquire points and add up to free yogurt. (A punch card system has been missing for a long time).   Next the staff... This particular location is great about hiring young high school staff with supa personalities! Its in the heart of Scottsdale, so a breath of fresh air to have fun, exciting personalities to interact with. Yes, they are just giving you a sample cup and a total... but that's all the more reason to have fun with it.   Cleanliness: A Plus! When families with kids come in and wreck a table, they are on it! A big part of 'pour your own' yogurt is cleanliness. They are awesome at wiping down the machine so as not to  have gross reminants left hanging and I supa appreciate that.

I feel like giving a negative review to one of the largest chains in America is dumb, short sided and negative. However, its not like I don't enjoy Dunkin Donuts..i mean everyone does.. its just that it happens to be down the street from Bosa Donuts. Thats just unfortunate.   I guess the one thing I will compliment is definitely their coffee. Their good old america drip black coffee is truly delicious even on a national chain scale. I find myself going thru the drive thru just to buy a 12 pack of Dunkin Kuerigs. I know I'm not the only one!   All in all, if you want a donut, go early in the morning, they aren't like Bosa who make donuts 24/7 throughout the day, therefore if you go after 10 am, chances are all of the good donuts will be taken, and those left will not be very fresh.

Only beer and wine is pretty lame for being owned by the neighboring liquor store. However, the vibe is cool, doesn't get too crowded and no DBags hand out here. The absence of food also pulls the rating down, however it is a solid HH spot for you craft beer fans.

I have been waiting to write this review until I was really inspired, because I wanted to do this place justice.   Sitting at a coffee shop, a little wired, listening to some amazing Explosions in the Sky in my headphones, I finally feel I'm ready.   The bad: North of McDowell. I mean, this place is supa close to me, so I'm happy, but I really wish this place had a sexy downtown location because it is so freaking good it would blow up if more people were near it. I feel the location, although keeps it a hidden gem, also repells people from going, although let me be the one to tell you, it shouldn't! You NEED to go here if you are chippy and salsa person. Bottom line. Not optional. The absolute BEST in Phoenix metro ever. If you disagree, hit me up and I will pay for your meal. I'm not kidding. I believe in it that much.   The good: The Salsa bar. Jesus Christ himself would call this Salsa bar a miracle. From reds, to greens, to peanut, to hot, to mild, chunky and smooth they have everything, hand made from scratch and incredible. The flavors actually rotate so some times you'll go and get a new treat to try. Most of them are inspired by regions of the world and have salsa flares about them. I can't stop, thinking about it now. I may leave this coffee shop and go there for lunch today now...   The gourmet tacos. Incredible, large chuncks of savor steak, giant shrimp (yah I know that makes no sense), and great corn tortillas make this no flour boy a very very happy camper.   Obviously you'll need to choose the right salsa to add on top of your already incredibly delicious taco, but choose wisely. The flavors are already perfect.   I hope this review has done it justice. It's incredible and needs to be in your rotation. Especially if like taking your friends out to new places they have never been before.

Ritos is incredible! I actually go to the one Downtown, but couldn't find it on yelp so deal with it.   The tortillas, OMG! Dying delicious.  The red and green sauce are good and all, but its the tortiallas that make Rito's so freaking good.   The steak inside the steak burrito is cooked perfectly. Chewable, savoury, and chunks of steak, not little bits   The place is bomb. The line is worth it so just enjoy!

All of Fox restaurants are legit, and Zinburger is no different. Delish ISH! Love the Breakfast burger w/ a fried egg on it. I get it lettuce wrapped, no mayo to keep it fairly Paleo. Sweet Potato fries are bomb and don't need the aoli they come with if you wanna keep the calories down.

Over priced drinks.  Occupants are typically 35 years old or older.... but trying to act younger.  Not much for dancing, and not in area meant for hoping around. If you drink here, there is no where else to go.   Not a fan.

The MM is a total Meh bar/restaurant. They have your typical 'okay' pizza, an average beer menu but nothing great. This just happens to be one of those places you go because a buddy is there with a group of friends and you get that text to head over, and you're all 'sure whateve'. Nothing fancy, nothing to die for, but you'll inevitably end up here. You probably wont go back though.

Windsor is a solid little date spot in central phoenix at Central & Camelback which you definitely need to take a girl a to. I have been twice now and wanted to share each of my experiences with you.   The first was about 9 months ago, where a lady friend of mine wanted to take me as she lived pretty close to it. We sat in one of the nice leather booths had a couple of cocktails and dinner. All of the patrons were super friendly and everyone kind of feels that because we all know and love this place, we should be awesome to each other. I love businesses that attract these types of people. Dinner was solid, I had a chicken sandwich sans the bun and garden veggies. I knew I would be back.  The second time was for a friends birthday dinner where we took a group of about 10. They surprisingly had room for us and nestled on nice leather couch towards the back. The cocktails again, maybe overpriced, but my Lawd they're delicious. They also have a great price for 3/4 pitchers of beer, so if you're a beer drinker, you're in good hands.   This time I had the PicNic Skewers, which is essentially one skewer of steak, chicken, shrimp, and veggies, served with an amazing mustard sauce and tamitillo salsa. Delicious!  The vibe: On the floor on the left side of the restaurant you will see, "You Should" and on the right side, if you pay attention will see "Question Authority". I love this. Thousands of patrons will come and go and never see this hidden gem of their decor.   The hallway to the restroom is lined with old cassette tapes, giving a great backdrop to a cute little date selfie.   Around the corner from the restaurants is the cutest dessert store ever! Technically, its separate but its not. Its part of the experience. End your date (especially daddy / daughter dates) for the perfect end to a great evening out.   Bottom line: You'll love Windsor!

Talk about a lame chain of a resturant! Just because you slap on a home town heroe's name on the front of a building does not mean you should ever go there.   The food is terrible and expensive - bad combination. Bartenders poor mad weak, I'm assuming to save monies. On my last visit during the 2013 NBA Finals, I did not care at all about the game, being Heat Spurs..I wanted to drink. Guess what? $150 later, no buzz!   Save your money and go elsewhere and hope Thunder Dan can do more with the GCU Lopes than he can managing the Suns or this Restaurant.

Seriously why did it take me so long to find this gem? A checklist style menu/ordering system is so pleasant and easy. It also helps from driving the cost of a burger way too high.   These two hippies simply nail the perfect lunch burger spot! A husband / wife running the front smiling and greeting everyone that enters, whether their first time or their 30th with a Piece sign and a "hows it hanging?"   I swear, the nicest people eva!  Also, the food is BOMB! Great burgers, sides / options, and a generous portion size. This is THE perfect Saturday burger lunch! I cannot wait to visit more frequently.

All of the reviews below are right. Luke is the man. Dude fixed my iPhone 5 front screen in 40 minutes.   Is it overpriced? Yes. But do you want it done right, and fast?? Then just blame yourself for not having a case, like myself, bring it, pay the money and walk out completely satisfied.   Phenomenal customer service and also work. It really does look and feel brand new.   I had an iPad repaired at a iCell Fix in Fashion Square mall...they were terrible! A) Took 3 days B) wifi didn't work, had to take it back C) another 2 days D) Off center...   Definitely come to Mac Masters where they know what they are doing and will get your baby back to normal quick!

Love Cartel Scottsdale. All of the Cartels, however especially the Old Town Scottsdale location. This place used to be an independanct owned coffee house owned by a church I think, and even though now it is a chain it has maintained that amazing independant feel.   The staff are supa nice, make anything you want, and judge you hardcore if you put milk or sweetener in your joe. I'm also a big fan of using Square App to process credit cards because they email you a receipt instead of waste paper. I've only ever been for coffee on Sunday mornings to study, work, and read. However they do have a lunch snack option and serve wine and craft beer.   Can't beat Cartel for coffee anywhere in Scottsdale.   Each table has is supa orignal, handcrafted. The patio is completely shaded and not bad even on a hot summa morning. Bring a friend and play some of their chess or checkers games or sit and enjoy free wifi: password espresso

One word: Brunch Sure you could come here for HH on Fridays (as there are always a large number of cute single ladies here).  Sure you could come to dinner.   I just don't know why you would! O.H.S.O is a brunch place period. A top 2 Mimosa in the Valley without question!  Back Patio! Forget about it. INSANE!!!!   I used to come here when it was "Black Forrest Mil" bar for dancing, and now that it has been totally revamped, I come here for the amazing back patio they added and great beer selection, mostly local to the AZ area is a big plus for us local boys.  And now... a game for you to play!  Everytime to you go... Create an acryonym for O.H.S.O and leave it as tip. I've played this game on FourSquare for years, but since Yelp is so much more amazing, I have to bring the tradition over here as well...  Some previously made acronyms we've come up with are... Obviosly Hot Sexy Occupants Other Humans Steal Olives Outlandish Hominids Sucky Oxygen Owning Honest Shiny Oysters Outlandish Hyper Sensitive Orks Orangutangs Have Sweetened Oranges Etc..  Please enjoy the acronym game here by leaving them as tips!

So I know what you're thinking... "Why is a guy reviewing a nail salon?"  So, a friend of mine recommended this place to me bacause I wanted a place close to where I live in South Scottsdale even though she hadn't been, she had heard it was decent.   Decent nothing! I took my 4 year old baby girl with me as a surprise daddy date before dinner and dessert. She flipped. Sat totally still and got her nails done, in PINK of course with GLITTER!  "Everything should have glitter" she explained.   The front desk girl totally flattered my little nugget calling her princess and asking her questions while our stylist got the 'quick drying' nail paint out, an essential for a baby.   The staff was supa friendly and accomodating and weren't annoyed one bit I brought a little one in. Def a recommend!

Breakfast is my thing. Sure dinner is everyone's thing, but breakfast is my thing. I don't sleep in on the weekends. I like to get up early, get on my bike and ride to a spot for some delish coffee, an omelet and to feel the morning quiet before tons of people start to go out shopping.   So I hit up Squash one morning hoping to find a hidden gem. Downtown Phoenix just doesn't have the breakfast/brunch options that South Scottsdale / Arcadia have, but at least I didn't go to Matt's for the 100000th time.   Squash is decent, right on first south of McKinley, and you can even see the old Matt's location out the back window.   My server was a young lady, obviously doesn't care about her job but is there. She took my order and brought me my coffee. It was cold. So I chugged it. I finally got more when my food came out, although it wasn't the server who brought it but a more engaged woman,  possibly the manager. She was quite pleasant, she really was.   The food was okay. The eggs in my omelet didn't feel like eggs honestly, but perhaps that stuff that is poured out from a container, but I have no proof of that so I feel maybe its better to not speculate.   Price wise, not too bad. Normal breakfast prices, and the Mimosas were actually very competitively priced at only $3, although I did not have one as it was too early (even for me).   All in all, give it a shot, but I don't I'll be frequenting this place and it certainly isn't a spot you'll be taking out of towners to see when they are visiting Phoenix for the first time.

A great CrossFit box way up in North Phoenix! The thing about CrossFit is that its communal, and its awesome that the people in N Phoenix have a place like this to workout. They just doubled their square footage, installed a sweet new rig and have great people in the gym.   A friend of mine goes to this box, as he lives only a mile away and he doesn't stop talking about it... But, that's normal for Crossfitter's right?  I went to their first open competition for local affiliates to come compete and they ran it very efficiently and made it supa fun.   If you live in N Phoenix and are ready to change your life.. hit up Spartanfit CrossFit!

Everyone loves Matts. I don't need to review it...   I do want to fill you in on the new location they just moved to in 2013, a block north of the old. It is larger, thank Gawd! but not much, thank Gawd again. That was part of the charm. Go on a weekday, when you have the day off and it wont be crowded. Being a sucker and going on Saturday at 9:45am is surely going to cause you to wait in line. Thats rookie business.   But the new location, is still small enough to keep its charm and unique, downtown, local vibe but large enough to not have to pull tables together for a 4 top!   Their food, menu, daily specials, and coffee all still consistent and amazing as always.

I had been a CrossFitter for about 7 months before Copperhead opened. I had been looking around and trying other boxes in my area looking to make some gains in my weightlifting and strength. I stumbled upon Copperhead on the Affiliate map, saw the website and a few pictures and thought the box looked gorgeous. I luckily happened to stumble in on opening day and I am so glad I did.   I've been a member here ever since and hate missing days.   Coaching: Mitch and Adam are incredible. They teach technique and form over time any day. They don't care how many reps you get done if you look like a CrossFitter instead of a legitimate Weightlifter.   I got my first Muscle Up and 200# Clean thanks to these two which were both HUGE goals of mine.   Facility: Absolutely Incredible. Not only is box huge, clean and has great equipment, we share space with a Ju Jitsu studio, affording us occasional time on the 'matt' for handstand practice and back flips.   Furthermore, the owner just broke ground DOUBLING the CrossFit size and really showing that he really supports this community.   Family: This CrossFit box is different. We are a family. Lake day trips, supporting our Coaches in Weightlifting competitions. We are truly knit together by the sweat and blood that we leave on the floor together. We help each other, encourage those next to us to beat us in a WOD and clap the loudest for the last to finish. There are no egos, no 'bros' checking girls out, etc... Everyone comes to put in work and feel great doing it. Bottom line, this is my favorite place to be in all of Phoenix!

I had never heard of this place. We hit this place up for a buddies bday after one of his friends got us kicked out of Sandbar. The name sounded promising... A) Who doesn't love margaritas, and B) a modern hip place is usually fun.   However, when we got there, we quickly found out why its in N. Scottsdale. The crowd is essentially a 45 year old and up early dinner crowd.   The drinks:  After all this a bar entitled with the word Margarita in it. So the Margs and premade, and the bartenders just pour them into glasses from a carafe. This has its positives and negatives.   Positive: The drinks come out quick.. You order, she pours, done.  Negative: No human element to it. If you request it a little sweet, they have to alter it. If you want more agave nectar, no chance, etc...   I personally am never coming back: But thats because I don't live up there. If I lived in Cave Creek or Desert Ridge, etc, you'd probably eventually find a menu item you'd like and find a way to make the margaritas not too sweet. Like I did by adding beer to it.

Alright, here we go. Pallets at Canvas : blech, my stomach cringes and turns to even waste my time writing a review for this place, but if you are a casual passer by or visiting the area you deserve to know the truth.   First the good: The location. I mean really it is a good location, 3rd & Roosevelt I mean come on. (That's all I have on the good).  The Bad: The location - I know I know, that was supposed to be good. But really, what the location really is, is sooooo typical. My biggest complaint about Pallets is how 'On purpose' it is. Its too perfectly located at the corner of 3rd and Roosevelt, not first, not 4th and just south, but perfect. God only knows what some venture capital investment company who owns this place paid for that spot. That alone rubs me the wrong way and makes feel gross for even going there once.   The distressed look. Listen, this place is super new, yet the sign of the building, the wood inside, the concrete floors are all distressed like some lame @$$ 10K grandfather clock.   The bike racks outside... Ugh don't get me started. Listen, its Downtown Phoenix. We get it, the bike culture exists and is growing. Post-hipsters with their brand new bought all put together fixies, Sunday Funday crowds on their beach cruisers etc.. But instead of just putting a bike rack out front you have to have them built into the shape of bicycles, then painted bright neon colors so that from afar way off people can see, "ooh this is cool place to ride bikes too." I feel like puking even thinking about them.   The food: Neo Asian fusion with bits of Sushi inspired by Japan, Korean food, and some obvious Thai choices. The problem here again is its so obvious. People that love thai food, I mean really love it don't get Pad Thai! People that love Korean food, like really love it don't get Steak and Broccoli, and people that love Sushi don't American Rainbow Rolls.  So if you're visiting do not sold on the location, use Yelp to help you find some real gold mines in fabulous downtown Phoenix, there are plenty, but skip this joint just like I will be forever as well.

The bar is nice as a bar, but thats all this is, a bar, that plays country music. LAME! No dancing? Way LAME! The screens and tv's are huge. We watched the Silva / Weidman fight here and really liked the visibility and lay out of the tv's. I'm sure I'll come back for football season and other fights, but I expect a lot more from a name like "Dierks Bentley's Whiskey Row".
