Overall the food is good,and I LOVE spicy Thai, but when they ask you how spicy you want your food, they are WAY OFF on their number system. I always ask for a #4 on each plate hoping its spicy enough, but tollerable to eat and when I get my food, its not even a #1! This has happend to me at least 4 times, and it really sucks when I get all the way home with the Take-Out to figure this out. Now when I pick up my Take Out, I have to taste each container of food before I leave so I'm not disappointed.

My daughter is 2 years old now, and I finally took her to the Children's museum. We both had such an incredible time. There are so many things for her to do there. It really have her a chance to explore on her own as I followed her around. The noodle forest was her favorite. The staff was very friendly and helpful. It's great to go right when they open and spend a few hours before nap time. We will definitely be back!

Best dive bar with awesome grilled chicken wings, and one of the best chicken quesadillas in town. You can go there on any night of the week and find live music, and a great crowd.

Must try the Chicharones de queso, carne asada torta, guacamole is amazing, and try to get a few of the street tacos. Amazing!

Sunday brunch is back! The homemade Bloody Mary mix they use has got to be the freshest bloody I have ever had. Nothing artificial or 'canned' about this one. Try the chicken waffle bites or the green chile pork burrito. I took my 4 year old there on Sunday and it has a warm family atmosphere, but still a wonderful Sunday football scene. Great place to watch the game!  Our family will be back next Sunday!

So happy I tried his place. I now pick up dinner Togo every weekend. Every item I try is so full of flavor, and cooked to perfection.  My favorite item is the Chicken Saag.
