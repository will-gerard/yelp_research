Service: Could have been better. We were left alone for long periods of time and only saw our actual server 3 times out of the 8 or so visits. Food: Disappointing. We tried a variety of rolls and found the portions to be small and the taste to be mediocre. We ended up getting dessert because of the small portions and we were fairly pleased.  Price: High. We were there during happy hour so it wasn't that bad ($4 for eight very small rolls), but I wouldn't be happy spending twice that during regular hours when there are better, larger portions at other sushi joints. The desserts were the best part of our meal, but not worth the $7 for a little ice cream and fried apples. Appearance/Location: It is a good looking place in North Scottsdale. The music was way too loud, which some people may like, but I enjoy conversation over dinner.  Bottom Line: Generally I find small Scottsdale restaurants disappointing and this was no exception. I don't plan to go back.

Service: Very good. Both times I've been here we were promptly seated and constantly checked on. If you order a water or iced tea they bring you a glass and leave the pitcher! For sodas they bring two! The food also came out very quickly. Food: Very good. I've had the signature protein pancakes and the choco-nana (I think) pancakes. The former are good; The flavor reminds me of granola. The later was fantastic and will probably lead to an early death. It is chocolate chip and banana pancakes with a big ball of vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup on top. Fantastic. All the portions are HUGE so come hungry. Price: Reasonable. You definitely get what you pay for, and some. Appearance/Location: Let's be honest, the place isn't going to win any style awards, but it is open, bright, and clean. I don't go to restaurants to look at wall art anyway. It is in a great location with a lot of other food and shopping. Bottom Line: A great joint for breakfast with tons of great food. I'll be back.

Service: Excellent. This a small establishment and our hostess/server took great care of us. If you have a second beverage already on the table before I finish my first, you are doing it right. Food: Fantastic. I've only tried the Mongolian Beef, Sesame Chicken and Crab Wontons, but I was impressed, especially considering the price. The menu looks to be quite varied and interesting; all dishes can be served with beef, chicken or tofu and a side of steamed rice, fried rice or noodles. They are very vegetarian friendly. Price: Excellent! I spent $8 and walked away very satisfied. At $6 an entree this is very affordable. Appearance/Location: Meh. Now I don't really care about these sorts of things, with food as good as theirs, but it is in an awkward, aging strip mall facing away from the street. It's a good thing the QT is right next door, or I never would have seen the joint. Summary: I will be going back and bringing friends.

I freakin' love this place! I've tried just about everything: Most of the burgers, several of the specials, the pulled pork, and tacos. Everything is awesome! Whoever the house chef is deserves to be recognized for his unique and delicious combinations. Just go here.
