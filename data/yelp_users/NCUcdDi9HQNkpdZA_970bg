I would not recommend staying at the Ritz.   With all of the great resorts and hotels in the valley, there are better options for the money.   I purchased a two night stay as part of a charity package in the expectation that what I was to receive was something special.   Don't get me wrong, the lobby and the bar are extremely classy and ooze Victorian elegance.   Then we got to our room...  First red flag that this wasn't going to be a Ritz experience, and a sign that you are generally getting shafted is when they stick you in the room that is right next to the elevators (723 to be exact).   Aside from marble in the bathroom, you couldn't tell you were at a luxury hotel. That said, the bed was very comfortable.   Red flag number two were the little cards around the room that asked us to participate in their environmental program and expect the room to be turned over once every other day and to reuse towels/etc. So, no fresh towels the following day.   I thought this wasn't a big deal as they had a locker room off of the fitness center. However, to call this a "center" is laughable. I'd call it a fitness boutique. Two showers, two sinks, a sauna and by far the cheapest complimentary products to use. $1 White Rain on a marble counter top isn't classy.   No spa, no salon (I was told I could leave the property and go across the street if I were looking these types of services). Not very helpful if you are traveling and need to get ready for a wedding or other formal event.   The over-the-top moment occurred when I reviewed my bill to find that they were going to charge $27 per night for overnight parking. When I asked how in the world they could charge such a fee I was told it was because we were in a highly congested area in Phoenix. Give me a break! It once again smelled of cheap.   Overall, I thought the Ritz is largely capitalizing on its name and short-changing its guests where ever it could. With all of the other luxury options in the city, don't bother staying here.

Best brunch I have had in a very long time. The service is beyond excellent. I couldn't finish a glass of water or mimosa if i tried. The servers worked as a great team and made sure our table was always cleaned when we went for more food and our glasses filled.   The seafood buffet options (king crab and shrimp) were tasty as were all of the meat options (lamb, roast beef, bacon covered port roast).   The only knock I would have against the food was the deserts, which mainly were little layer cakes. They tasted stale and prepared long before they were served.   However, you will impress everyone you bring with the amazing views of the city.

Such a great steakhouse! I could not have been more impressed with the experience.   It started with a knowledgeable bartender that put together a refreshing gin mixed drink and a solid gin martini (I always recommend Hendricks).    For dinner, started with the oysters which were very good. For dinner I got the double cut bone in fillet. Talk about an amazing flavor! I really appreciated being able to see an example the cut prior to cooking the meat, very nice touch.   For dessert, I had the chocolate lava cake, which was delicious. The server was nice enough to give us a free VIP after dinner cocktail.   I will be going back.

By far the coolest wine bar with the deepest menu in the valley. The scene is dark and intimate, making it perfect for a night when you want to wow that special someone.   That said, Kaz has become increasingly popular over the years to the point where going on a busy night on the weekends can be frustrating. If you're planning on coming with a group, come early or call ahead.   The best night to go is Thursday when valley Motown jazz legend Dennis Rowland performs. The "jazz experience" in such an intimate setting always makes for an exciting eve.

If you are looking for authentic Italian with a great right-on-the-corner atmosphere look no further than The Grotto (and by that I mean stop wasting your money at Bucca).  My absolute favorite on the menu is the chicken parmesan. The cut is lean and fried to perfection, topped with delicious mozzarella and served with pasta with "tastes like it was made back East" red sauce.

After having my dogs stay here on five separate occasions, and after our last experience, I feel compelled to warn everyone to avoid using Always Unleashed.   Brian is a great manager, and we really wished that his level of customer service was present in the rest of the business.   Karen is one of the most abrasive and unprofessional people I have ever met. During our second time of using the service she literally argued with my wife over a billing dispute, in which Karen was in the wrong, to the point of making my wife cry. This was the day after our wedding, mind you. When confronted by me Karen denied everything, which demonstrates how shallow a human being she is and how delusional she acts as a better-than-the-customer "owner".   I just picked up my very stressed out dogs who were literally drenched. When the dogs were given to us, by a 12 year old worker which in of itself was odd, she indicated that my dog just had a panic attack and gave a short apology. Completely unbelievable.   My Boston came back with a belly full of marks and with crusty seemingly infected eyes. (See picture.)  I would expect that either when I was away I would have been alerted to such a development or at least have been made aware about this when we picked her up. Not only do you not receive any sort of exit report, but their streaming cameras have not been working. [Edit: They haven't been working on phone browsers, which when you are away and traveling could be extremely useful.] I think this says a lot about how transparent they are and how little personal attention they apply.   In short, do not trust these people with your dogs.   Follow up to Karen's response: Just to get the facts straight, the Living Social coupon that Karen is referring to was actually a Groupon that clearly stated one coupon per person, not per household. One was for my dog, and one was for my wife's dog. Karen verbally assaulted my wife asking how it was possible that she purchased two coupons. I purchased one coupon, and my wife purchased the other. My wife asked why Karen was being so mean to her, again, the day after we just got married. When I called Karen to discuss the matter she played it off that it was a mistake in the Groupon and that my wife just had a "misunderstanding." When my wife was crying as she left the store, was that also part of the misunderstanding?   I would also like to point out that there weren't any other customers in the room when my wife asked if Karen was f-ing kidding with the way she was acting. Karen would like to slander my wife's character in an effort to prove her point, which again demonstrates how shallow of a human being she is and how awful she is as a manager.    To be clear, we never apologized to Karen. When I called to complain about the initial encounter to Brian, he apologized to us and indicated that both coupons would be honored, and we decided to utilize the second coupon during our pets last stay. When Karen attempted to start an argument with me regarding redeeming the coupon I repeatedly told her to call Brian, which she refused to do. To her credit, she did honor the coupon, but not without providing me with the abrasive response that she did. But again, Karen sets the facts aside and wants to present things as she sees them.        The "wet dog thing" is actually a picture of hives that developed all over my pet during her last stay. My pet required a steroid shot and now is on medicine to clear things up. NOTE: I am glad Karen now acknowledges there is a rash, but denies her service was responsible!    But who are you going to believe, Karen or your lying eyes?  You can believe Karen or you can believe the person who has clearly articulated his concerns with the quality of service received by Always Unleashed.  2nd Response: Maybe you should take the advice of some of the negative reviews and actually talk to your manager Brian. Since you still refuse to provide the actual facts, let me just lay them out for you.     For the record, my wife and I purchased two $50 Groupons (bar codes 2435-8710 and 0801-9536). The first Groupon was utilized on May 19th, at which point you threw a fit and yelled at my wife, the second was just utilized on July 21st in which you refused to honor what Brian had to agreed to to settle this matter.   Additionally, we paid for the temperament test, and paid the full rate June 15th for day time services and June 29th for day time services. At no other point did we utilize coupons, Living Social deals or any other sort of discount programs, so stop trying to mis-characterize me or my wife.   3rd Response: Not your resort? THE PICTURE IS FROM THE DAY WE PICKED HER UP. She was FILTHY and SCRATCHING HERSELF when we got her. Did you leaver her outside during the monsoon?! If she was covered in filth, did you think not to clean her? You were negligent to the care of my dog and it cost me $68. We have paid full freight on more than one occasion you slanderous liar. BEWARE

11.26 Update: I would point out that Karen is updating her responses to my complaints after she just received another complaint about vet bills from Yelper Sue P. If you want to gamble with your pets health, take them here. If not, look elsewhere.      Prior updates: If your facility is wall to wall artificial turf, and since my dogs came home covered in filth/mud, you have admitted to leaving my dogs outside during the monsoon. Did you know that dust is a significant trigger for allergies? That ties out what happened to my dogs during their stay at your facility.      Karen has more than proven my point regarding her lack of professionalism.   In addition to her updates, Karen contacted my wife and I directly with the following two emails:  07/24/13 at 11:29 AM: "Your dogs were never stressed and because they you alls as their parents they can't come back Well miss them though they are wonderful"  07/24/13 at 2:49 PM: "Crazy they weren't stressed!  As I said I really do wish you well, we just don't get along.  I'm sorry I rubbed you the wrong way and vise versa  I'm not, nor is Always Unleased for everyone, my apologies.  Best of luck."   In addition to slandering my wife and I, Karen has now identified us by name on the Yelp platform, which not only demonstrates your her of professional, but I believe is a violation of the TOS of Yelp (which I have made them aware of).    There was never a third coupon, as Karen continues to lie about. I have provided full verification of what actually transpired here, including the actual Groupon numbers, which were purchased.    So long as Karen continues to lie, I will continue to present the truth.   At the end of the day, fellow Yelpers, you need to decide if this is the type of person you want to trust with your pets.  Note: The actual fine print that this pathological liar refuses to acknowledge: "Limit 1 per person, may buy 1 additional as gift."

Delux is by far one of the best beer and burger spots in the valley. I recommend getting a classic with double applewood smoked bacon and cheddar. Add a mini-shopping cart filled with sweet potato and regular fries and you have the perfect cure for previous evening overindulgences!   As an added bonus, Delux is currently featuring Lagunitas Brown Shugga' on tap, which is an amazing american strong ale.

I have been absolutely blown away with the quality of this gym. I recently transfered to the DC Ranch Village from the Camelback location. While I will miss the polar plunge and the bar by the tennis courts of the former location, you can't argue with how nice this location is.  Sure, some might complain that the monthly rate is too high, but the equipment is nearly brand new, there are a variety of classes to take all the time, there's tons of towels and water refilling stations, the rental mountain bikes for the local trails are free, the place feels like a resort (very much like the Montelucia), the locker room looks straight out of a country club, and the pool with the mountainside views is spectacular.

After hearing lots of positive reviews, I finally had the opportunity to savour the Sunday brunch at St Francis.   The food is fresh and rich. The Baker's board was a great start and showed the range and sensible attention to basic details offered by the kitchen.   The St Francis Bloody Mary, apparently voted best of Phoenix, was carefully crafted from at least eight different ingredients. While I enjoyed the veggie base, the flavor profile is distinctly citric. Unfortunately, I am more of a fan of salt and pepper, so next time I am going to have to pass on what otherwise was a great cocktail.   The Cucumber Cooler was refreshing and tasty. Anything with Hendricks does a body good.  I highly recommend the fried egg sandwich. Bacon + spice + mozzarella + red peppers = yum.   The wood-oven baked eggs was the wow offering on the menu. Baked eggs and braised beef plus broccolini and tomatoes with bread is a rich and filling plate with a taste you'll want to visit again soon.   On a busy day, a couple may be able to get away with finding a great seat at the bar. However, if you're you're coming in a group, it might be worth calling ahead.

OTT is the definitive go-to, within walking distance, unassuming, right in the middle of everything, easygoing retreat within the heart of Old Town.    The beer list has surprising range and offers great selections such as Lagunitas IPA, Great White Hef, Odell 90 Shilling, and Dogfish Head IPA.       The primarily outdoor bar is welcoming and pet friendly.

After going twice, Cullinary Dropout is likely my least favorite of the Fox Restaurant Concepts properties.   The first time, I at least got to laugh. I ordered a large-format Chimay Red Cap which the waitress was uncomfortable trying to take the cork out of, thus requiring the attention of an overly confident manager. As the manager was mid-sentence in his explanation of how skilled he was at handling the situation, the cork shot by my face and nearly took the eye out of another patron sitting at the table adjacent to me. (Which made for an uncomfortable remainder of my stay.)  That said, there are some tasty bites on the menu including: soft pretzels & provolone fondue and the pork belly Cubano.   That said, the entrée's are sometimes less than memorable. I've had better short rib pasta, the beer battered fish and chips are okay, and I'd rather go to Lo-Lo's for chicken and waffles.   Also, last time I went I got stuck at a small table by the door on a relatively chill evening and then waited 20 minutes for a waiter to show up. Service thereafter was painfully slow.   If you're looking for a relatively upscale beer experience, I'd suggest going across the street to Yard House. If you're looking for a more wine oriented time, I'd recommend venturing elsewhere.

Yet another impressive event! While the heat always gets you, it was much less muggy then last year.   I was very impressed by the increase in the amount of beer vendors in addition to wine vendors for this year's go-round.   The demonstrations by Chef Payton and Chef Kantak + the infamous Richie Moe were definitely a highlight.   I think the only improvement would be to segregate desert and coffee oriented offerings in to the shaded corner by the museum, instead of interspersed amongst the rest of the offerings. Otherwise, what a great time!

I had the pleasure to eat at the back bar at Orange Sky. The bartender was friendly and attentive and made a great Burbon Collins and suggested a delicious Zin for dinner.   I had the oysters and the fillet (with the compound butter sauce), both which were excellent.   Unfortunately, it took some time for my dinner to come out of the kitchen despite the fact that the restaurant was not all that busy. This made a quick bite turn in to a multi-hour affair. Additionally, it was disappointing that you are exiled to the no-view back bar if you want to have an entrée at a bar.   Otherwise, I had a great time. I would recommend reserving a west facing table around sunset if you're looking for a great romantic setting.

Wolfley's has everything you could possibly want in a local bar/restaurant with lots of room and walls of TVs. The menu has a ton of choices, making it a great place to bring a group with mixed tastes.    I am a wing fanatic and Wolfley's Cajun Buffalo wings were the best flavor I have had in years. If nothing else, I will be back for these!

Total failure in execution on a take out order consisting of 2 dozen  wings (which I thought were good last time) and a custom pizza.   The wings were soggy and and had little flavor. It also looks like some of the pieces were not fully cooked.   The pizza was an abomination that had a base resembling a straight-from-the-freezer-isle pizza in consistency and taste.   After my second go-round with Wolfley's, I significantly regret having such a high initial opinion of their food.

Tanzy proved to be a pleasant culinary surprise in the new Scottsdale Quarter shopping complex.   The upstairs, vaulted-ceiling, heavy use of creative metal design throughout has a welcoming and stylish feel. The large bar makes dropping in as a couple very approachable, although a reservation would be prudent for the weekend.    The food is very very good and has a freshness that only quality ingredients can provide. The tagliatelle bolognese comes in a heaping portion and fills you up without leaving you with a heavy pasta dinner feeling. If you're in the mood for a solid pasta meal, I would highly recommend this dish.   The braised beef short rib with goat cheese gnocchi is great, although the flavor profile came up a little short (I would recommend the short ribs at Citizen Public House over what Tanzy had to offer).   While I did not have a custom craft cocktail, I did appreciate the fact that each corner of the bar was equipped with lots of fresh fruit and every flavor of bitters you can imagine. I will be ordering one next time I stop by.   Finally, I always appreciate a bar/restaurant that serves a less  ordinary beer on tap in addition to serving craft cocktails and wine. In this case, I would highly recommend the Racer 5 IPA by Bear Republic Brewery.

If you haven't heard about Citizen yet, you soon will. Old Town's newest treasure has the perfect combination of great location and ambiance, amazing food, a smart beer list and unrivaled cocktails.   After going twice since the opening some of favorites thus far include:  Lagunitas IPA on tap, Pisco Sour, Turley Zin, Tenderbelly Pork Pastrami Belly Pastrami (a must have), Fair Trade Coffee Charred Short Ribs, and Tenderbelly Pork Tender Loin.   The staff is friendly, prompt and knowledgeable. Citizen offers a variety of seating options, making it a great neighborhood drop in or perfect setting to impress others on a big night out.

Wood fired pizza with meats from Defalcos, what more could you possibly want?   With my ancestors from Calabria, my heart, along with my taste buds, were warmed by the Kicker, which features Calabrian salami and hot oil. The Nutella shake as a desert was also a nice European-styled touch! Will be returning soon!

I was so excited to find out that a new casual beer bar was coming to the neighborhood. I looked past some of the recent negative Yelp reviews and hoped that my experience would be better. Unfortunately, at the end of the day Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers just did not deliver.   As for the beer selection, it is fairly decent, including one of my favorite beers (Bell's Two Hearted).   With a beer bar, I would expect that the servers have a minimum requisite amount of background in the beers they are serving. Alas, the bartender was more of a Miller kind of drinker and an off-shift server (who was a loud bar patron) demonstrated an even lower familiarity with the beers being served.   Being that it is a newer establishment, I can look past the fact that the servers didn't know their product. That left my end opinion significantly reliant on what kind of burger was delivered.   I had a $12 Bacon Bleu burger with onion rings. If I'm going to have a burger that costs more than $10 I expect a ton of quality and a lot of flavor, neither of which was provided. The burger fell apart on what I thought was a cheap quality bun and the meat tasted as though it was sourced from the discount pile at Bashas in the same plaza.   If you are looking for a quality beer experience in the area, save your money and go to Four Peaks.

If you are looking for the best craft beer bar in Old Town (if not one of the best in the valley) Brat Haus is your spot. I thought it was so good that I went two nights in a row!  Attention Bells Two Hearted lovers...they have it...on tap! Not only that they have some of my favorites including a spread of Lagunitas, Stone and Dogfish Head.   On my first visit, we were not messing around and ordered the delicious Dogfish Head 120 minute IPA. Be warned that it's a $15 bottle, which only seems expensive unless you have had it served to you somewhere else (Taste of Tops charges ~$20 when they have it in stock).   We split the pretzels and fundido to start. The pretzels are delicious and are a great  filler/base when tackling the beer menu. The fundido was good and I'd like to try it with sausage/exotic meat. I had the guest Sicilian sausage with peppers which was back-East-style delicious! The next evening we stopped in for apps, and I repeated the pretzel and fundido order and stuck with the Two Hearted all the way.   I can't wait for it to cool down a little bit so we can enjoy the expansive outdoor area. I also predict that this will be one of "the" destinations after spring training games. Well done Payton and I look forward to visiting again soon!

"Why am I here?" was the only thing I could think of while standing on the handicap ramp in a very crowded, very poorly chosen location.   I've thought about the positives: Expansive craft beer selection, relatively quick service considering the space constraints and crowd size, live music, and lots of guest brewers coming in (shout-out to Four Peaks!).   But after considering all of these positives, I was still standing on a ramp with a $7 Brewdog IPA (which is amazing) in hand questioning why in the world they would put this great of a concept in this terrible of a location.   I can't help but to think that World of Beer Inc. saw an opportunity to capitalize on the craft beer culture that has been pioneered by the likes of The Roosevelt Tavern, Four Peaks, Papago Brewing and Taste of Tops (among others), and forced their corporate concept on to Mill Ave in to whatever space they could find.   It should be noted that this Florida-based company is being run by the former management of Outback Steakhouse. At least I hope the franchisee is a local and has better bona fides than the corporate Outback crew.   If you really are in to craft beer, support your local proprietors!
