I stayed at San Carlos May 19th - 20th. It was merely "okay".  I liked:  Historic old school hollywood feel. It was chic. I dug it.  The place had character and I particularly liked the outside of the rooms more than the in. We were in walking distance to the places we wanted to go.   How about no on these items: Surprise! No hotel parking. You can pay the Valet 20 bucks or pay 15 over at chase's parking lot.  Surprise! They hold an extra $25 on your card in case of room damage.  Ghost lounge? It was Saturday night and the dance floor was empty. It wasn't the plan to go there but it was kind of depressing to see that.... Ghosty goodness? Nope. There was a somewhat weird vibe about the place but nothing really standing out. My house has had more ghosty vibes and action that I received here.   It has the potential to be pretty awesome but the surprise extra money you end up spending seems like it makes up the difference of what you save. I will probably avoid going here again, including the club.

Ah, the veggie house.  The complimentary tea is excellent. I do understand the language barrier being and issue with the waitress on staff. I've had the problem a few times. However If you end up with David he takes very good care.  Three strip soup, Lemongrass chicken and the spring rolls are big favorites of mine.  The service has always been on the slow side and I've never gotten out of there in under an hour.  I never realized it was a cult I just thought they had an real admiration for the woman on the wall, whom I figured owned the place.  Anyways I've always found it peaceful not creepy and find it excellent to calm and eat good food for good prices. My omnivore friend begs and pleads to go to this place whenever we're together which speaks volumes to the tastiness.

Tonight I tested out the new Loving Hut. I grabbed some To Go, and honestly it wasn't as good as it had been previous times. : ( While I didn't see any of the slaughter videos mentioned in more recent review than my last one, I did notice the extra tv running the normal Supreme Master info.  The new layout is nice, but I liked the food from before, my sweet and sour faux pork is now labeled "sweet and sour divine" and has bell peppers that it never had before. Three strip soup has been taken off the menu completely (they did make it for me though :) I'm hoping it'll be better if I dine in next time, but for now I'm fairly disappointed with the new Loving Hut and left missing the Vege house.

This place....Oh My..... Well if you're a vegetarian...RUN.  I got stuck at this place due to a corporate event my company hosted there.  Let me say, how excited I was at the idea of Mexican food at the Christmas party. Then my vegetarian instinct kicked in when I got there....hmm....lets check for lard. I asked the waitress who was going around...slowly I add but it was a busy night so maybe the service is faster when there isn't a huge event going on. (I'm thinking understaffed?....hoping?) Anyway, I was then informed that they cook their beans with bacon. What? Yes. Bacon. So there went the idea of a burrito, a tostada. Depressing. I ended up eating the very "ehh" chips (deep fried tasting and thicker than the typical chip. I'd venture to guess possibly flour chips?)  I'm not a big drinker so the allure isn't there for the bar aspect.  I will honestly never be back and from what the people who actually did eat there said I didn't miss anything.

I enjoy Joeys, esp. if you are looking for some place quiet.  Whenever I have been in there my guests and I are the only ones in the place. I actually spent my 21st birthday dinner here. The owner is really nice and remembers my name each time I'm there, in fact he is almost always the person who takes my order.  I do agree that the prices should come down a bit..  The service will keep me coming back. I don't really get the creepy vibe that the other reviewers got but then again I didn't take the vegetarian house as a cult either.. Its excellent for dates you actually want to talk to, its been a cure for the restaurants that I can't even hear my guest speak. I must say, if you do go and enjoy liquor try the lemon cello. The owner makes it from scratch and its even better when you dip cannolis in it.

This is a great bar. Bar service was friendly and helpful, even though I am that annoying customer that has no idea what I want. The bartender tried to figure something out for me and was more than willing to customize. Through out the night the waitresses checked up on us (my friend and I) and made sure we didn't need anything.  There was a few times with the female vocalists that I couldn't hear them over the music but, the issue was promptly fixed. (This was from the Otep show in November)  I have been to Joe's before, but it has been years. They've expanded and now have a patio. The feeling of the show is small and intimate, which is the experience I prefer versus bigger venues that have everything super blocked off. Great place to hit up excellent rock shows. I highly recommend here. Its not the prettiest bar, its not going to be like a nightclub...ever...thank god. It is definitely a good bar, with a good selection and mosh pit allowance. They also have consideration for underagers (not me but still to include everything) and section off a space for them.  OH! and I almost forgot, they had a big serve yourself water container on the bar, which I thought was brilliant. It kept the bartenders free from pouring water all night and people didn't have to wait for an essential drink of water.

I Love, Love, (Let me repeat it once more for effect) LOVE this place.  I was invited out to brunch with a few people and was unsure about this place, it was kinda hidden behind the home depot...in fact I missed it the first time I went there. Being a vegetarian I looked at the menu and noted almost everything had meat...which may be my only small issue with the place..the lunch is pretty meat based. HOWEVER!!! one beautifully glow point...they will take it out, make exceptions and add things with no issue. Once they came out with it wrong, it was taken off my bill, immediately fixed, apologized for and I have never had any issue with service. Actually, haha I've been in several time but my last visit was in August(Which this is where I demanded breakfast/lunch on my birthday). I walked in Saturday at 12:10, told them I needed to be out by 12:30 and they were incredibly accommodating. Made sure I was seated where I could read (I went alone) and the food was out by 12:20, so I had enough time to eat, pay and leave. Also the waitress thought ahead and brought my drink in a to go cup. The (I believe) manager Kat remembered me from August! Execellent customer service, Excellent Food and to the person who complained about prices...have you been to IHOP/Dennys Or Village Inn lately? Crackers is on the same level if not somewhat cheaper for some things. P.S. Try the tea & Bread Pudding! Its great and my vegetarian friends don't be afraid to tell them to subtract the meats. I always get the New Hampshire Skillet - No Meat, add in tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms and it comes with broccoli. YUM!  )

I ended up here on my birthday and the bartender made a stellar impression on the phone. We called around 6-7 on a Saturday night and he said he would have a table waiting.  I was thrilled to come in, and it was a nice atmosphere. They do well with the space they have. I was a little sad by the menu because they vegetarian options were limited.  I ended up ordering the fettuccine alfredo with mushrooms. Typically I adore this dish, I can make it from scratch so I'm a bit picky about it. It came out with onions which was not on the menu. I despise onions with a passion. I had to wait for the waitress to come back so I could tell her, that was a good 5 minutes. When told she rushed off without a word, although I was still trying to ask her a question. It was really abrupt. She was generally nice most of the visit but I was still thrown off by the weird behavior. Apparently it was not supposed to come with onions anyway. The other gripe I have is that the sauce seemed watery and runny instead of the thick creamy sauce alfredo typically would be. The wine was very good, but again with the waitress I attempted to ask her about the wines and she did not seem at all knowledgeable while she dodged my questions. I'm not sure if we would make a return visit. Service and the confusing food issues just aren't up to par with surrounding places. My friends enjoyed their food though although were also baffled by our waitress.

I really enjoy coming here for the happy hour/reverse happy hour. The staff is hit or miss, if you a have a good one then you will be well taken care of unfortunately if you have a bad one prepare to wait forever to even order.  I'd love a few more vegetarian options on there but I definitely make do with what they've got. Drinks are usually good but sometimes a little strong for me, but I'm a wuss so people who like to taste the alcohol will like them a lot. :)  They aren't really prepared for younger kids to come in so keep that in mind if you are bringing family. Oh. and its ALWAYS really loud with the music.

Last night in an attempt to go forth and have a fun night with friends we visited this place...and now we never will again.  The music was loud enough that we could barely speak to each other and place looked divey, but we were going to try it anyway. After going to the bathroom whose stall door looked like it was kicked in several times and barely hanging on. The awkward unisex bathroom has only two stalls and wasn't very clean. (Which indeed matched the rest of the place.) The bar chairs and tables looked like patio furniture that desperately needs replace. The karaoke books are cheap plastic slips in binders and also need replaced, as they look like they've had better days.  The service was awful, it took forever to get some service, (I'm guessing this place is a go up to the bar and order) The bartender was rude and talked over us without listening much.  The place was also dead, not including us there was about 8 people there. This dive has definitely dove and we'll be spending our money where upkeep is more of priority.

I love this place. The review about them being angry I've never seen.  They were some of the nicest people I've met. When I said something about wanting more vegetarian options the reply was "we'll make it work! just let us know." There is no Alfredo on the menu, but the waiter guaranteed that it'd be no problem for them to make. The 4 formaggi pizza was fantastic. The spaghetti is great, so is the cal-zone. Everything on the menu is served with good sized portions, enough so that I have leftovers. Which is awesome as I am the queen of leftovers.  I highly recommend this place and if you want something not on the menu ask, they are more than willing to accommodate.

I found the food excellent, but keep in mind this isn't typically Mexican food this is Tex-Mex which is a whole different variety.   Our waitress was fantastic, and talked me into getting the melted cheese on the side. It was quite tasty, indeed it has a bit of skin but generally if you cook cheese or milk included products into a liquid quickly it does get one..and personally I didn't haven't issue about it.   The menu isn't extensive, it would be nice to have a bigger menu but with how accommodating the are, you could probably something off the wall and they'd be willing to do it.  I ordered the bean and cheese burrito, which is delicious, and large.  Its a fatty, and I loved it.  When asked if they cook with lard the hostess had an immediate answer and listed what they used to cook everything with. I was so happy. Most have no idea, and aren't very polite if you ask. She was very friendly like everyone else we encountered there.  I was told that the Steak was perfect, and mr.hard-to-please was filled up (had left overs) and stayed that way the rest of the night. Which was great. The salsa has an interesting flavor, and I must I dig it. I"m not a big fan of mexican rice so I didn't partake in eating it, however the fan of mexican rice at the table liked it, (but not as much as the fajitas)   Conclusion - Excellent Staff, Great Food (Its Tex-Mex..not just Mex so bare that in mind. There is a difference!) Atmosphere reminds me of some place that would be placed in a Tarantino film. Price is average sit down if not a little high. Expect 2 people = over 30 dollars.

Wow.....I have not ever had any of the experiences of the bad reviews.  I frequent here enough where they know me by name.  They've always been nice, professional asked me about my work, hows life etc.  My foods always been on time, hot and tasted good.  I don't think my order ever has been wrong but I order pretty basic.  Bean & Cheese burritos, 5 dollar cheese pizza, Deep fried mushrooms & zucchini. Anyway, I dig this place. Its great cheap pizza, no frills and the burritos are monster sized.

I remember many years ago how much I loved going to Captain Bills.  My mom found this place and I loved the stickers and the subs were good.  Plus i was cheap enough that my mom could afford it. I decided to bring my brother who lives out of town here even though i hadn't been in awhile, and I brought my three year old daughter. A mistake I will not make again.  First off, there was no sourdough. Which there definitely used to be.  My sandwich was pretty bland, it tasted like bread and thats about it. Plain white bread. Yum! Glad I drove out of my way for it.  Then, the most awesome part. My kid needed to use the bathroom, but oh wait....They don't have one that their customers can use. i was instructed to go ask the Mexican place across the street. Thats what I want to do! Pick up my three year old and drag her across the parking lot and pray that we make it in time. I won't be coming back. The once funny stickers it seems are only updated with political crap instead of general humor, the once great subs are bland, their service varies depending on which high school student you end up getting but most of the ones I've encountered during the times I've gone had attitudes that I chose to ignore because it was a fun, unique place that had good subs, and finally....to end this huge run on sentence there isn't even a bathroom to use. Just that, in itself is enough where I'd question going back but the whole experience including the food is just not worth making the trip there any longer. Stickers and history can only take you so far.

I hadn't been to Sizzler in years, and had the urge after moving for some salad. This was the only salad bar close and so I talked my reluctant fiance into going.  The service was super nice and attentive. (not annoying attentive mind you, he kept our drinks filled and made light conversation) The manager was nice as well, and everyone was helpful.   The food was constantly being rotated out with fresh food and everything was kept clean. I don't think there was a moment we were there that the staff wasn't cleaning something. It was great.   Only the bathrooms weren't the cleanest/nicest, definite wear and tear from the area.  The fruit was possibly the freshest and sweetest I've found all summer in particular the watermelon. Don't hate on Sizzler just because its corporate...this place has topped the service I've been receiving elsewhere as of late. So if you're in the mood for customer service, cheap prices and all you can eat I recommend that this Sizzler be your destination.

I've never experienced anything but pleasant helpful staff any time I've been here. Years ago I dropped by on my way to work for a bagel & drink, they were fast and good then. Today I have them deliver to my home and they were fresh, good and they've changed up the spreads to even better. There is actual veggies in the garden vegetable spread. I do prefer the previous way of doing spinach and cheese bagels but this one is excellent as well. I also ordered a sandwich, that didn't come out right but Linda was very helpful and easy to deal with in regards to a replacement order.

This place....Wow.  Okay, so after work my friend and I went on a dining adventure. We decided Italian and we were using the yelp finder deal and everything that popped up was just....No. We drove by here, flipped around and decided to duck in here to check out the menu.  As we walked up we were confused as we still couldn't find the yelp for it but we walked in.  The hostess gave us menus and as I asked if they use chicken stock in their Alfredo she went over to what I found out was one of the owners. They do not use chicken stock. Our soon to be waiter popped over to tell us everything in the place was made as you order from scratch.....I nearly died of happiness. We debated over many things and settled on fettuccine alfredo and my friend had meat tortellini with meat sauce.  We both enjoyed our food immensely. It was amazing. We then had tiramisu that pretty much had us wanting to order another round even though we were completely full and ready to be rolled out of the restaurant as ball shaped humans.  Our service was nice, he was helpful. The owners whom I met upon leaving, because I popped over to gush about their restaurant were also complete sweethearts.  I will be back! Addiction list, this type of place is what you're made for! Oh! Also! I was informed all their soups are made with vegetable stock! Hooray for vegetarian friendly!!!

For what was supposed to be on the nicer scale of hotels on the strip I was very disappointed. I guess that a bribe is needed for a decent room to be had, forget the fact we paid over $350 for two nights.  We were placed at the 21st floor and had a view of the back of buildings.  I do not suggest this hotel if you are going to ever put on your make up, the yellow lighting was awful, and all over the room. I figured out that the mirror on the door was better than the bathroom mirror due to the yellow lighting being lessened at that area.  Also, several machines in the casino were down and the guy running the roulette table wasn't very friendly at all. We ended up spending more time in Ceasars than our own hotel.   The "Le" everything actually became the joke of the weekend. Its ridiculously cheesy, never mind the romance, which our room wasn't very sexy at all. I actually think they gave us a handicap suite.   Over all, the Stratosphere beat them when I stayed there last. In room, staff and price. I cannot see the reasoning behind this hotel having a 4 star rating, especially with the amenties being far and few. (15 for internet? come'on. La Quinta has free wifi. ) Its best feature was the location, because you truly are in the heart of the strip, however I think I will try some place else next time, they did not impress..

Everything was yum here. Server was attentive even with a heavy crowd.  Woodchuck was on tap. We splurged here in an over eating extravaganza. Worth mentioning: Artichoke was hot when I requested it out quick. Now you think this would be the norm, its not. Usually everywhere ends up waiting til its cold to serve you the artichoke at least luke warm.  We also had the mac and cheese (squared?) vegetarian style and it was really good!  Truffle fries: YES. Calamari was a hit, and my darling date enjoyed gardein chicken strips.  My daughter (18mo) enjoyed her grilled cheese, fries and a cherry lemonade.  The whole mean was yum. Glasses stayed filled.  We will be back...

I cannot believe I have forgotten to review one of my favorite restaurants.  I have been coming in for years and I absolutely love it. I typically get the pasta plate and order a gnocchi with garlic butter and spinach which is big enough on the full for me to take home and eat for lunch the next day.  The half is good sized too, but you only take a little home then.  The atmosphere is typically friendly. (Every once in awhile you encounter a miss-hire with the wait staff. I had one waitress every time I came it. Ugh. She was just not cool but I'm hoping she just isn't there any more.)  The decor is old an Italian homey feel.  I will say I prefer this location to the newer one near the 101. Its a smaller setting, I don't feel as forgotten and my food is always hot at this location even when I do take out.

We ended up here twice in our Vegas stay. They are open to mixing up the menu a bit (adding, subtracting things) The servers kept our drinks up. The food came out hot. Our dinner was fantastic.  On our lunch there, our server was somewhat non-existent,  and our food was eh. My alfredo came out rather watery, and broccoli undercooked, but it was okay.  Which is why this review got 4 stars instead of 5.

I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. It was clean, beautiful and classy.  I loved the modern and fresh look and the staff was helpful as well as friendly.  Now, you may be thinking....Ali, if you liked it so much why only 4 stars?  Well that my friends is because of this weird hold they do on your card when you check in. I'm used to giving my card to hotels, and I figured this would be no exception however upon check in they place a hold on your card the value of the room...even if the room is paid for. I've seen small charges on the card...or hotels just keeping the number on file but at 70 dollar hold after already paying for the room is a bit ridiculous. Also, paying the 30-something 'resort tax" on top of the room cost was a bit much esp. since we spent 2 different nights here in the same week. Ouch. I have to agree with previous reviewers about the free late night snacks it is a bit detouring to need to head down to the front desk, we thought there would be a minibar/snack thing in the room. It was quiet when we stayed there on a monday and then on a sunday night.  We will probably stay again, but will definitely plan for the "hold" charge.

I came in about hour before closing time to Claim Jumper.  All I truly wanted after a day of mall shopping was good customer service and I received it.  Artichoke appetizer came out cold, Bam. Server took it back, fixed it.  Took it off my bill as well. This guy got everything we needed, when we wanted it and I just loved it.  I highly recommend Danny as the server to request, and yes I left him a close to 50% tip. Excellent service. I called up to tell his manager as I wrote my review.

This has to be one of my very favorite spots. Their cream of mushroom soup is excellent. In fact I once began craving it in Glendale and drove all the way out just for that.  Their bartender is knowledgeable and is happy to help you pick out something you'd like. (Also, let you try and write down the names)  The waitstaff has always left something to be left desired and the place is always packed. I'm not a big fan of their bread.  However, their from scratch pastas and ravioli is all I've ever ordered outside of the mushroom soup & wine. Which, I must say is amazing.  I highly recommend to anyone.

This location isn't very helpful with their clients. I wandered for quite a bit before finally finding someone to ask questions of, who ended up disappearing with another customer.  I also was informed they no longer give out samples due to a lawsuit which I was surprised about. I was speaking to someone about potentially booking services, we seemed to get a long pretty well and she ended up advising me longer than the original person had.....however I went to check out, but decided to go look at something else before I leaving and I'm pretty sure I overheard her and another person talking about me negatively for asking about samples (I didn't know the new policy that they couldn't and any time I've been before the people helping me in the Scottsdale store had insisted on them) and assuming I wanted free services...which I didn't...so this is close my work, and I've gone back but I doubt I will book any services in the future with location and only stop in when I have a quick pick up and already know what I want. I'll visit MAC, Sephora and try to drive out to the Scottsdale location if I'm going to be changing up my routines and products.

Roxanne Myer is the only person allowed to cut/dye do anything permanent to my hair. She is amazing. I have brought her in pictures of anime and she recreates the cut flawlessly. I've brought her in photos of two different styles and she works with me to create the look I want.  I should say the way I ended up at Bangz.. I had my hair cut by someone, who did an OK job.  I decided I could dye it myself. -.- Which was very bad. Upon waking the next day I had an orangish streak and dull black hair and it was awful.  I couldn't style it at all.  I had a photo shoot in 4 hours. Quickly I called Bangz, open on a saturday. Roxanne was available, and was my hair savior.  She dyed red over the black giving it the look I had wanted in the first place, fixed the cut to what I had really wanted and styled it.  She is absolutely the best, I have received loads of compliments on the work shes done with my hair, and I swear if I ever moved I'd come back just to get my hair done with her. Shes is not only my hair dresser at this point, I consider her a friend (I never see her outside of the salon, but I absolutely adore her.)  She is priced very inexpensive considering the talent behind what she does. She isn't 20 bucks but a cut is under 50.  If you have anything you want done I recommend her with all of my compliments. She is the best.

This is my new favorite place and what my addiction list was made for.  I came here twice in one a few weeks ago. I stopped in to grab a cup of tea when I had food to pick up next door. The staff is amazing. Helpful, sweet and definitely one of the reasons this place is popular is the customer service. The tea blends all smell amazing and you can see everything in there, fruits etc.  I think my favorite is The Grey Duchess. Once the staff compared an Oolong I was buying to a huge. I think, The Grey Duchess would be like a passionate kiss from a beautiful woman then. Its floral and pretty, I don't even use sweetner with it. Honestly most of their teas I don't even feel like I need sweetner because of how flavorful. They will custom brew you a cup right there if you want btw. I am kicking myself for not stopping in sooner. This place is the best. If you even just like tea a little....run not walk down there to enjoy a cup.

I really enjoyed the Grand Lux Cafe. The staff dealt with my menu changes without a second of "oh, you're that customer" Which I loved.  I became addicted to their Peach Bellinis which if I had nothing to do and lots of cash, I could probably spend a lot of time there sipping.  The staff had my guest and I seated immediately, every time I've been there. Each waitress has been wonderful. Kept their distance for privacy but kept drinks filled, order was as ordered and food was hot.  I agree that the price could come down a bit. The recipe isn't hard or costly, but I guess the $17 is for ambiance right?  I could also do with out needing a jacket every time I'm there.  No one ever had any issues with us staying late. In fact on a friends birthday we were there 2 hours after closing and they didn't say a word, just kept refilling the glasses. Although also be warned if you go on your birthday they basically serve you a fried peice of pastry with some powder sugar.

Yesterday I ventured into Roka Akor as it is near where I've recently started working.  I am a big fan of sushi places. I may not be into eating the fish but I am all about some miso, veggie tempura and veggies rolls (...and whatever else I find minus meats). So upon finding myself on a closing shift and hungry I called them up ordering a bowl of miso soup-$5 and an order of veggie tempura - $6. i was told it would be about 10-15 minutes so I waited 10 and headed over. I spent a bit of time waiting at the bar where the bartender was friendly but very obviously busy.  It looked like the drinks were well poured and I found myself thinking maybe a night after work I could gather some friends up and have some drinks, dining & fun. I will say that this place is decorated beautifully.  On to why there are two stars. I was delivered my bag and I walked out to my car did a quick glance to see there was a bowl and a box in there as I was walking.  I returned to my desk and busted out a small bowl of miso soup which was half filled. The tofu looked as if they had fried it. It was ok. I've had much better that was more cost proportionate. I had hopes well, maybe that was a mistake and some how I ended up with a complimentary side version of miso instead of the appetizer. I shrugged it off. I then opened into my veggie tempura, how disappointed was I to find seven pieces of bland vegetables. Had I not looked I would not have really been distinguishing the difference between the vegetables, just so you know my taste buds are not damaged (non smoker, 1-2 a month if that drinker). Now completely disappointed and irritated at myself for wasting eleven dollars here when I could have gone to anywhere else near by to get a portion of something that was actually filling. I still clung to the idea that maybe this was a mistake where the portions were incorrect but alas upon my phone call to their manager today it seems that is what should be expected from this particular place. I will stick to other sushi places that give me more than a double shot of miso.  As you have probably figured out I'm not coming back. Just for fun, I'll post what I saw when I opened up my food from Roka so you know what to expect.

I visited this Z Tejas a couple of months ago and had a fabulous time. The downstairs was about to close, but they said no problem seating us anyway.  The bartender actually served us and did a great job.  When about to order something he had tried and hadn't liked he gave his input and explained why. Which I appreciate the honesty about a product he didn't feel was up to standard, saving me the time trying it.  My food was hot, and tasted great.  Our server didn't know how I liked my sour cream so he brought out both ways. Cold and the way the chef served it.  My drink was never empty. Service was honest. Food was hot. They did great and I plan to return again. Unfortunately my second visit was less amazing, but still good.

I'm rather conflicted on this place. So far, I've gone three times.  The first the food was absolutely amazing. It came out dish by dish and was incredible. Not only hot and fresh but mouth watering.  This is when the owner was there, and he was chatty but distracted by a sports game on. We were the only people in the place so service was directly from him and quick.  The second time I had take out, it sadly wasn't as good but I figured it was because I took it home and shrugged it off. (owner wasn't there that time) The third time I went the food was luke warm, and wasn't as impressive.  I'm thinking its a hit or miss based on if he is there.   More on the owner, he was really nice to us, very passionate about his food and love of food. I could see where he might have come off as arrogant at times but it wasn't anything that bothered me. I preferred him to the girls working the 2nd and 3rd visit..at least with him our food came out great. I'll be back to get another impression since its unclear if my first experience was a fluke or the other times were.

I've visited this location a few different times hoping to get better results.  Alas, its a no go.  Its always incredibly busy, very loud and the tables are small. (They have a few bigger, but apparently if you're only on a date, small is the way to go. I was afraid of knocking my drink off the table.  The food is alright. The artichokes give me the feeling they cooked them earlier and then microwaved it before they brought it.  The grilled asparagus didn't seem fresh at all and actually reminded me of when I forget I have asparagus and pull it out of the fridge a couple days before its going to be bad.  They did however make the portion bigger with the strozzapreti, which I appreciated when dealing out $16 for a pasta dish.  The service was really slow even when the room began to clear out.  (We ended up being there for about 1.5)  Oh, and word of warning wear shoes with serious tread. I've been there wearing heels twice and have nearly fell because of the floor.  Beast seating is outside because you escape from the busy, noisy and crowded inside however, keep in mind you're in the middle of a shopping center so you will have cars driving by, and people all around you. Its not a horrible place, I'm not absolutely against it, but its really not worthy money they charge. My date had some sort of steak which he said was decent, the sauteed spinach wasn't very good and tasted canned and the crispy Italian potatoes were alright.  He said "It was decent, but not worth $28. He also said by the outside he expected a lot more from this place and the decor inside he wasn't a fan of at all.   BTW, Vegan in Yelp listing? Almost everything on the menu has meat, butter, or cheese on it. I wouldn't call this place Vegan its barely Vegetarian.  This was my last try of this location of NoRTH I've had better service and food at the Glendale location. I'd say, save your money and head some place with a little more class, faster service and better food.

Cafe Review  I can see why raw foodists adore this place. It has a lot to offer.  If you are huge into vegetables, raw foods, fresh tea this is a fantastic place for you. Its about a fresh as fresh can get, and tastes green. Its good, portions are large, you can split a wrap easily.   If you're looking for cooked dishes this really isn't your place, they don't really seem to have much to offer on that. However their soup was good.

We headed over to my old movie home AMC 30, where I've been going to since my teens but I haven't been in quite awhile. I took my daughter to see the Jungle Book. We went out for a quick dinner prior to the movie, with tip that meal was about $20. Now, you may be asking me...Ali....why are you telling us about your dinner when we're on the AMC yelp profile? Well let me tell you friends why that is relevant.....we bought our tickets, no big deal, I was around $12 for us, we went around 5ish and my daughter is only 5...so kid pricing. Yay! We stopped at the snack bar. We had, you know just eaten but she really really wanted popcorn and a slushie.... 1 Small popcorn (which was not at all small), 1 medium Slushie (small doesn't exist and it was a pretty big one) and 1 medium soda (also, I would have said large on this one too) $17 and change. Seriously? Are you SERIOUS? My dinner at a sit down restaurant was LESS than the snack bar for 2 drinks and popcorn? I spent more at the snack bar than for the ACTUAL TICKETS? Insane. While AMC 30 has nostalgia for me, and we may be back, we for sure, will NEVER, No, Not Ever, Not Even IF I AM STARVING, plan to visit the snack bar again. Remember when Harkins started doing the shakers of popcorn flavors and they're just chilling for you to use whenever? Well AMC like that idea, but, heres the catch .45 cents for a small container. Way over priced, Do not ever go and get snacks there, if you're a snack and movie person, go some place else, this place is so catastrophically over priced on their food and drinks its insane. That being said, movie was good and the theater was completely empty.

The scene: Its stylish, clean and new. They've been up and running under a year.   The service: Super nice and right on top of everything. If our waiter wasn't on it, another one was right there to take care of it.   The food: Definitely inexpensive (4 items at $7) You can get a good, filling meal for two people easily under $20. Mine came out a little cold, but it was tasty. It was also out fairly quickly.   Overall: We'll be back, they took good care of us and its a great late night stop (open til 12am)

This place was great. I'd love some more flavor options but the fact their fruit was fresh, tasty and had variety!   Love the smoothie option!

I absolutely love this shop. Both women who attend the shop, one being the owner I believe are absolutely friendly. However, honest enough when asked what do you think, they give you an opinion that actually counts instead of the normal shop garbage of everything looks great.   I found so much at this shop I loved. Some sexy high pumps, a couture dress and several pieces of jewelry fitting a hard to please friend's taste.  The prices are reasonable, and if its been there for awhile she'll work with you a bit.  A truly great gem amongst the resale shops. It really depends on the item if its expensive or not. Its very worth it going in.

I am currently sitting here at my computer eating #28.  Which is egg noodles stiryfry with mock shirmp (I cut the mock ham)  and I opened my dish up to find, a veggie stacked dish.  YUM! Tofu, Baby Corn, Cali flower, Broccoli, mock shrimp, Bell peppers, cabbage, and noodles. Not spicy, which is good because I fear the spice!   I found this place driving home and saw "Grand Opening Boba Juice" I threw on the brakes flipped a bitch and went right in The staff is friendly, and the place is well kept. I was hoping it was going to taste as wonderful and I hoped and I was right.  Its great. I will be back. Hooray Central Phoenix for having good boba and good vegetarian food!  ***I drank the taro smoothie boba. They didn't skimp at all on the boba, was made quickly and tastes good. I wish it was maybe mixed just a little longer because a couple sips were a little powdery but the rest of the drink was awesome!

So I finally decided to do it.  My first waxing experience. and it was on. Brazilian, full leg and underarms.  The works.   The front girls were super nice, I really like them.  I went to the back with Sarah and it was ow. super ow.  I was super stoked so I walked out of there, left a tip and went home. When I hit home I realized that she had missed several areas, told me to tweeze or shave the rest.  After realizing how much was missed I wasn't too thrilled.  I called up today (the next day) and spoke with Erin the manager who booked me right away to come back in, apologized and said it would be fixed.  I came in and got the amazing Rachael. I will NEVER go to anyone else again. She was awesome, total turn around from the first girl.  I am hair free, she was nice, it didn't hurt as much.   If you ever have an issue with service here, it definately is to your benefit to speak up. Erin is excellent at finding solutions to fix the situation.  and again, I gush about Rachael's professionalism and fantastic work.   Thanks guys!

Would you like your chow mein to look nothing like chow mein? Would you like to have zero noodles in your chow mein but actually receive a small white bag of things that look similar to capt. crunch instead? Oh then this is place for you. If you'd like actual chow mein look elsewhere. This has been the weirdest customer service experience of my life. I called after I received my order, which was like..40 minutes later and I live right behind them...like seriously I can jump a wall, walk about 30 feet and there I am. Anyway, that wasn't a big deal I figured it would be that long. I call back after I opened this and saw what I had received. Also, ordered were spring rolls which were not crispy and oily enough where I needed to wash my hands after touching them. I told them this, and they told me that is how their chow mein is.....and I told them I was massively unsatisfied and I wanted a refund. They then told me to come down there and bring the food back. As pissed as I was, this was the last thing I was concerned about. I was then called back by one of the workers stating that they would not give me a refund because I should have known that they make Chow Mein without actual noodles referring to the menu which says "crispy noodles"....except there were no noodles....just a white bag of weird small pieces of something they are saying are noodles. I then get into a yelling match with them, let them know they will be taking it back and I'll be there in 5 minutes. I came in there, returned the food and they handed me my money back, I returned the tip for the delivery driver since its completely not his fault that they aren't actually service chow mein. One girl at the front told me "I needed to calm down, and that if I have illness I should be in a hospital." after that I will never ever order from them again. The ordeal of this entire thing is enough to not only keep me from returning but I will tell everyone I know in this area about it. I would vote them a negative star if I could. The only small amount of customer service in the place is the owner who called me later on and apologized. Unfortunately there was a serious language barrier so I'm not sure he understood what had happened other than a customer was majorly pissed.

Oh My, Tasty. I walked in trying to find a family owned candy shop that was there years before and what a surprise. I was greeted with the smell of baking from scratch french bread and a gorgeous array of desserts. The Lemon bars are to die for, as are the very rich brownies. The buttermilk pie is fab, and so is the almond bar I tried.  I waited for the french bread, and should have taken the offer for her to cut a piece off before I drove home with it. It smelled so good, I picked at it the entire way home. The woman (who I assume was Shelley) was polite and was a total sweetheart as another customer came in and babbled on about her medical history for the last 2 years barely pausing to take a breath. *sigh* Go Shelley's patience!  I definitely recommend this place. Also my Vegan compadres, she lists on her card "Vegan Delectable" as well as, "Dairy & Wheat Free" and "Sugar Alternate Items". Go Forth & Indulge My Friends.

I love. Love. LOVE. Jessica and her awesome little dog.  She was so completely freaking awesome.  I was on a hunt for something specific and she helped me, we almost found the perfect thing but alas, boobs foiled my plans for the perfect vintage look again. Damn you. Damn you both.  Anyways, we did find an awesome red dress and she directed me to the other vintage shops around. I super loved that she was so cool to offer up competitors stores. She is tops for customer service, satisfaction and a great selection.  Super cute clothes, great prices. :) Blueberry Deluxe live on. I'd cry if you ever shut your doors, cause I have to come back for more!

I'm mixed on 3 to 4 stars for this place. Here is why:  The Great: My server was fabulous. Complete sweet heart and was completely friendly.  She kept a good pace of us never needing anything and being a part of the experience but never made it feel as if she was over doing it or intruding.  Sarah was a great server that night and I am sure if I go back I will request her again.  She genuinely seemed to really want this night to go well and did her best to make sure it did.  The Good: The food was good. Typical melting pot. I was disappointed that the big night out menu had no vegetarian option. That was really irritating but we moved past it and went with the Spinach Artichoke fondue, California salad (with sharp cheddar instead of the Gorgonzola) split of the vegetarian entree, and a custom mix of the dark & milk chocolate fondue with assorted flavors we chose. My mom was more impressed with the entree than the fondue which is sad for a fondue restaurant.   The Not So Awesome: Where we were sat we had people buzzing by us all the time, it was close to the kitchen. I remember comparing it to feeling as if we were seated in a hallway. Which, to be honest it seems like there is a lot seating that would feel that way.  As I mentioned earlier the vegetarian option was rather limited and I was disappointed in their lack of foresight with the Big Night Out Menu not having any vegetarian option. From what I've seen before from this place this isn't a typical and they usually have an option to turn the big night vegetarian if you wish. I don't know what happened this time, but bummer for our entire table.  Also, its not the easiest place to find. Go take a drive around the building after turning right in the first available turn in point and on the other it mentions the melting pot's entrance is around the corner.  To sum it up, honestly I believe I would have had a much less enjoyable time if it wasn't for the shining service of our server. If she had been someone else and not been so good at her job I probably would have been rating this place lower because the atmosphere was just ok with our seating, the food selection was much more limited that normal and what I had expected. I'm not saying I'll never go back, but if/when I do I'll be making sure to reserve a table in her section to ensure my dining experience goes well.

This place was good, and service was friendly.  Their fruit left something to be desired and there wasn't a smoothie option like at Mojo. I definitely will be back at some point but this isn't someplace I'd head to if I wanted something healthy, its more of a sweet spot (plently of sweet flavors, candy add ins etc)  vs. Mojo had both the sweet stuff and a healthier fix covered.

I've been to this location twice. The attendant was friendly. The menu was easy to read. The taro boba was fresh and yummy! The doughnut holes were cheap and so damn good. I love this location. I love Bosa.  This location is a far cry from the other on my DNR. This one goes for the addiction list hands down. I'll be there again soon, I only work 10 minutes away.

This place is great. Whenever my order is wrong its fixed no problem and often offered a complimentary dessert to help smooth the situation. The staff is friendly, helpful and looks actually happy to be working there! I'd definitely love it if their vegetarian soup selection was more often but I am very satisfied with what I have had there. I have not ever had a bad experience there. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a quick place to get some quality food with actual customer service!

I loved Hollywood regency and I love Antique Sugar even more.  I am a super fan.  I came in on the same hunt I was on when I went to Blueberry Deluxe and Tucker helped me so much.  Customer service is the BEST in this place.  Between him and some awesome customers that were in that day, I had some great help finding the perfect dress. Which for me is no simple task. Short with an hourglass figure.   Definitely going on my addicted list. I'll be coming back for more.  Not to mention Tucker is super cool!

This review is from their drive thru menu. Be careful to really look closely at this chaotic display of a menu, you may think that something is one price and its actually another.  The items and prices are so close together in and in different sizing it looks like they just slapped updates up there and hoped everyone would figure it out.  I figured out I had made a mistake when I ended up at the window paying 5 bucks for a taro boba....with whipped cream that I wasn't given an option to decline (I hate whipped cream on drinks.) When I was completely caught off guard by the receipt handed to me, because the attended didn't let me know the cost before charging me and I stupidly had not realized that I hadn't followed their menu since everything was close enough to be mistaken for another price or item on there. I spoke up and asked about it, the attendant was rude about it. The boba was cooked well, however not enough of a pull for me to pay more and have to deal with rude service/chaotic menu. Eh. Another for the DNR list.

This place is absolutely amazing. The flavors are to die for. If you see this place around (its mobile) I definitely recommend grabbing a cup. They let you sample to find the perfect flavor and they will let you mix which is good because when I try them I'd like to take a huge cup of all of them. Last trip to the Lulu stand was at the Rave Run and I had Coconut/Mango/Orange.....and it was so good. If I have money and this place is around...I know where my cash is going to.

This place is awesome!  The prices are great, its clean, they actually use vegetable oil and NOT LARD. Thats right folks, I can actually go through this place late at night and get myself a burrito without the worry of lard!  YES!  Thank you Federicos!  I am so looking forward to getting my Black bean/refried bean cheese burrito mix from them. They are located right next to my 2nd job and they are the bomb.  Also, the burritos are big XD.  You will not be disappointed either your stomach or wallet if you stop in here.

I can't really think of anything to say about this place.  It was dull.  I stopped in because I switched work locations again, and craving a veggie roll hard.  I ordered to go.  Miso soup- Bland, it was eh. Decent portion, just not really anything that I'd purchase again.  I gave the specifications of what I wanted which was veggie tempura roll, they were out of broccoli which was :(.  The roll came apart, the rice rolled on the inside which I'm not a big fan of.  It was kinda a waste of money and I do not plan on coming back.  Oh, and it was really cold in the place.

The food was great. The service was too. My only wish is more vegetarian food.  They do hummus, and domas so well I only imagine if they came up with some more vegetarian friendly dishes. Heads up, theres meat broth in the soup which made me sad. I totally was game to eat it til I found out.  Prices are very reasonable and if you order take out (which I did) its ready on arrival. Definitely check it out. I'll be back...and I'll keep praying for more vegetarian dishes. :)
