Friendly staff, but way too expensive for a simple oil change. I pay $20-$30 at most other places. Here they charged me $46. I will not be coming back here again.

This was my first time at BJ's and I was pleasantly surprised. We started with the calamari which was cooked to perfection and had some delicious dipping sauces.  I had the Tavern-Cut Garlic Chicken Pest pizza and my wife had the Double Deluxe burger.  The pizza was a good blend of all ingredients.  My wife's burger was still juicy and delicious even when she ordered it well done. Even the beer was above par. I had the house lager which had some great robust flavors. The kind of beer I would expect to enjoy at an upscale bar. And last, but not least, our server Alicia (sp?) was fabulous.  Very accommodating, friendly and on top of everything. Although it was on the higher end of my price range, I would definitely eat here again.

One of my favorite little local restaurants! The street tacos are amazing.  I love the cultural variety they bring from south of the border.  The art and atmosphere are hip but not pretentious.  And the salsa bar is stocked with 20 different unique flavors. Watch out! Some of them are very spicy! Small inside so there was a wait on Friday night, but the service was fast and friendly. Love this place!

I'd been here once before but this time it was even BETTER!  Drinks are great...I had the raspberry gimlet. Food is amazing. Mac and cheese muffins were to die for and the slider sampler was very flavorful.  Along with the games and good music (although it was a bit loud for conversation) I would recommend this place for any group gathering.

Sunday brunch made delicious.  The wait at 11 am on a Sunday morning was long but worth it.  I had the Pork Confit Benedict. The pork was amazingly juicy and flavorful and not at all overpowered by the hollandaise sauce.  My wife had the Oink Omelette which was massive (with 5 eggs) but delicious with bacon, ham, and sausage.  Reasonably priced for the quality and service.  I would definitely eat here again.

My wife and I came here during the Tempe Festival of the Arts just to have some beers and were delightfully surprised by the food and beer selection. The Flatiron steak sandwich and tater tots were delicious and the selection of beers was definitely to my standards. The wait staff was friendly and efficient when we sat at the bar.  We will definitely be coming back here.

Love this place!  They have the best Old Cuban (my favorite drink) and other craft cocktails. Good ambience. Great staff - they always have great recommendations for drinks.  Unique menu with delicious food.

Great happy hour.  My friends and I went for dinner on a Thursday night. Not too crowded. Amazing staff and service. And all the dishes we ordered were some of the best food I've ever had. I had the green chili Mac and cheese and it was a perfect level of green chili. My friends had the Athena pasta, the Mediterranean pasta, and the roasted butternut squash rigatoni.  All equally delicious! I will be coming back here soon and often!

I was looking forward to some delicious BBQ for dinner and was thoroughly disappointed.  My wife and I dined for about $30 ( not including an underserved 15% tip). What I got was worth about half that.  Two strips of semi-dry brisket, burnt Texas toast, and decent 5-cheese Mac and cheese with a can of soda for about $15.  Not even close to being worth it. I would not recommend this place.

If you want delicious organic food, this is the place to go.  I went their during a busy Friday lunch rush and it was still a great experience.  I had the Flying Avocado wrap which was delicious. My wife had the Forbidden Rice which was equally amazing.  I kinda loved that they had tea and lemonade to drink and NO soda.  They also carry a local brew, today's pick was Four Peaks White Ale.  There were many great choices on the menu, even a mix and match section.  I would recommend this to anyone who has dietary restrictions...or anyone who loves great food!  Yummy!!

I highly recommend this place! I tried it for Restaurant Week and was not disappointed.  They had a great selection of local beer. Their wings were a 4.5 out of 5 on my scale, and I'm very picky about wings.  The sauce was a perfect mix of heat with a little sweet.  The Lone Star burger was perfectly cooked and delicious.  And I loved their mason jar brownie sundae.  My only wish was for a more engaged waiter.  He came to the table, but never really asked if we needed anything or how our food was. Otherwise I will definitely be back to try the other burgers.
