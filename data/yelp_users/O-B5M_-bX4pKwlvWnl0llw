Service was horrible had a child who was waiting to be seen I told had solid himself ( fully potty trained) and no one did anything. I was carrying all the patients stuff instead of being given a bag. I seen dried up blood in the procedure room bed all on the back and side of bed. It was well over 45 min just to get our discharge paperwork. We were told we had a 6 hour wait by the doctor then nurse said no only a few. Nothing is consistent. This was all experiences in the emergency room. I was highly disappointed considering all the renovations they are doing to the hospital seems like they are making the outside look good but what about the inside???!!!! I'll look in Tempe and drive to Tempe to find another hospital.

Great store. Clean, friendly service and good prices! Best part is free childcare! Gives you up to 90min to shop kid free! Video monitors are set up around the store so I can keep an eye on the kids.

Extremely poor service. An older man sat us down at our table, with papers on it. Didn't even say hello. He was rude and not friendly. He came to take our drink order and I asked if they had root beer he rudely said "no, beer, what?" So he brought me orange juice which he chose for me. I got up and left before my drinks even came. Took my money and business down the street. They really need to work on hiring better employees. I will not go back again! Went on a Sunday at around 5pm.

Great prices and very friendly staff. The staff is helpful, I needed something they walked me right to it. I am impressed on the selection and prices. I won't shop anywhere else but here. Parking lot is clean and restrooms too!

Amazing food and service! Our waiter was constantly checking to see if he could get us anything. FOOD IS AWESOME THOUGH! I was really impressed. It isn't cheap but still not that pricey.  I thought it was worth it. The kids enjoyed the green sweet salsa. They give you chips and three kinds of salsa when you sit down. Totally recommend this one!

Loveeeee this place. Sign up for ikea family card! Free coffee or tea up stairs each time you come. Plus 1 additional hour of babysitting (when it's not busy) tips about babysitting:  it can get veryyyy packed fast especially on the weekends.  Sign the kids in and then go up stairs to get food or down stairs cafe for. 50cent hotdogs!

ZERO STARS!!!! I can't express how horrible their service is. There is a cashier who has been working at frys forever and her service is in the toilet I can't believe she still has a job there. DONT SHOP HERE! I was made embarrassed about my form of payment today and this was the straw off the camel's back. I have never been treated so badly in my life. Will never shop here again!!!

Much better than wildhorse. It instantly smelled better too! Not like super heavy smoke. The pay out was descent. Not a lot of open slot machines but I seen plenty of room at the tables. The staff was nice at the player club. I would recommend this casino over wildhorse.

It was a small stinky casino. You have to bet high. Even penny's, I couldn't find anything cheaper than 40cents a spin. I came out smelling like smoke bad my hair and clothes. I ended up Going down the street to Lone Butte and it was better.

Good homemade cooking. Ma and pop place. Great service too! If you want a more intimate conversion though others can easily hear you. The crowd is mainly elderly but it doesn't matter best food ever! Glad we tried it!

It was really long class but our instructor made it really fun and interesting. Pay online and save time. It was a descent price. The class was full. No need to bring any paper maybe a pen but they have handouts. Ladies wear shorts or pants you will be getting on the floor doing compressions on a dummy.

I absolutely love this place! The service was amazing. They asked if we had ever been there before. It was our first time they brought out good size samples of tons of bbq!  I got the pulled pork sandwich, it was so yum! I added regular sauce on it. My kids got the turkey it was the best turkey I've ever tasted! The atmosphere is awesome!  Just a really great place all around! I highly recommend this place and if I could give more stars I would! My all time favorite place to eat hands down!!!!!

Just like the name says, it has an American twist on Mexican. I love it because it taste amazing and is good Mexican but not the kind I gotta run the bathroom immediately haha. Chips and salsa are a must add them to your order. El pastore burrito was ugh ok but carnaisada burrito was yum!

It was ok. Over priced for what I got. I got a regular spa pedicure $25 plus callous remover $5. I seriously did not get a massage I got lotion rubbed on my feet and legs. That's the best part of a pedicure is the massage so I was disappointed. Also the technician did not speak to me at all until the end when she wanted a tip. I guess everything's worth trying again but it was a waste of $30.
