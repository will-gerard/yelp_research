Right now I'm really disappointed. Only frozen meat, one type of sausage. They say they have grass fed meats, good for them, but I didn't stay to find out.

My Mum has been coming here since I was a kid & now, as a growed up, I can't imagine going anywhere else. Dorothy has a great eye for color & design, she has worked with me to frame a variety of media including photos, buttons, antique cross stitch, drawings, and of course posters. Sometimes the project starts with the frame! I can attest that the craftsmanship will be excellent & that the project will be completed in a timely manner. The best part is that while custom framing is not cheap, Dorothy will work with me to make it affordable and beautiful.

Holy Happy Hour, Batman! 2 melt in your mouth sliders with smoked Gouda, a side salad & a beer @ just under $10. I'll be back & I'm bringing my friends.!  Staff is good, regular @ the bar with his paper is friendly & fun. 2/4 beers on tap are local.

The scuttlebutt around the 'hood was that this place is a great new addition, so I thought I'd try it out for taco Tuesday.  The deal is this: $1.75 street tacos & $1 off a salsa flight & drinks. The kicker is that the drinks are expensive to start with. A Corona for $5.75 ref price & $5 oh happy hour - in this town! You've got to be joking! The margarita was bland & sour, I couldn't drink it. My exchange was handled with grace by the bartender, so kudos there.  I got a round of their tacos, four.  Pollo asado: very dry meat, all white though if that appeals & bland.  Short ribs: not bad, also a bit dry.  Braised pork: finally a tender meat! Subtle but nice seasoning.  Octopus: the winner, well seasoned & tender , with the natural flavor coming through :) something that is actually quite difficult to obtain.   The skinny: Bland overpriced food & drink attempting to play to the CenPho crowd & thinks it's achieving through decor. Clearly a gringo trap.

You get what you pay for - not much. I found my fish to be tasteless, rubbery, & high on food coloring; spicy is not an actual descriptor; fillers are rampant.
