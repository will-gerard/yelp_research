Yeaaaa ceba hut! The best sandwiches goin in tempe in my opinion. Whatever you do YOU MUST get it on their garlic bread! I suggest the East Coastern (pastrami hot) but you really cannot go wrong here. They have an entire menu of tasty choices, and they deliver for you too if you can't drive! At the shop you can grab a kool aid, enjoy some good tunes from the employees, and watch cartoons. They've recently expanded so there is also a lot of new space for people to enjoy their sandwhiches. (Personally i liked it as a packed joint, but whatever space is cool too. Definitely get your sub toasted. If you're super starving, grab one of their tasty soft cookies! They have a huge stoner theme going on, which is great if you appreciate that! but fear not! the sandwiches are good enough for any "square" to crave it on their lunch break. GO GO GO, you will not be dissapointed. LUNCH or munchies.

yay, im a fan. Of course it's starbucks, but this one is good. They're quick and pretty friendly. Not overly strange barista types. At night it can be a good place to get some work done as it is decently empty at night. The crowd comes in at lunch and late morning. Early or late enough and you'll have a free spot to get a cup.   I'd tell you what I had, but it's starbucks, if you don't know what to order...it's 2012.

The absolute must go bar in Tempe. Perfect for an afternoon drink with friends. Sit outside nestled in trees, blocked away from, but only a few feet from busy downtown Tempe. Perfect place to kick back, relax, and talk with friends.  The atmosphere is very relaxed. The music is also a plus playing music spanning from independent artists to classic rock.  If lunch is what you're looking for then look no further. Casey's has a terrific menu of sandwiches, appetizers, salads, and full meals. Famous for their oysters, Casey's is definitely not just your average bar. On that note it is also very laid back and very much so "every mans" bar. A strange paradox! Check it out! It's also haunted!

This trendy sushi bar holds an amazing happy hour! Tues-Sat 430-630, prices are cut in half on sushi and other menu items, and the martinis (and other drinks) also receive the half off treatment. The bartender we got was a great guy, knowledgeable on the menu and funny. I recommend the Barry White Martini or even just asking the bar tender what he recommends. The white sangria was also very good. For sushi I'd recommend the red hot chili pepper and for an appetizer get the spicy rockin shrimp tempura.  The ambiance is pretty trendy, more of a place to go for a cheap happy hour early dinner and drinks with friends. Good music playing and tv's on, also not a bad place for a first date. Very fun, relaxed atmosphere. Think chill scottsdale sushi club almost. A seat at the bar is probably the way to go depending on how large your crowd.   Definitely worth your time, some of the best sushi I've had in Arizona.

It's a chain, so you probably know what to expect with the food...delicious! If you are unfamiliar with Panda, they offer great chinese food at the ready at good prices. Definitely grab chow mein and orange chicken, then throw in any of the other entr√©es (kung pow being my go to). Also the spring rolls are great and be sure to experiment with sauces.  This particular one, however, lacks in service. There's usually a long line that is poorly attended upon. Often times I've had to wait while they cook up refills. I've also seen them have only one person on for dishing out food and running the cash register.   Besides the service being slow, the place is clean and has good seating. Perfect place to grab a quick meal or to cure that chinese hankering! Good lunch for with friends or solo study time.

Guys, skip applebees, this is where to take a lady. It's not expensive, there's delicious bruchetta and salads disguised as "trendy" "light" food, and great drinks. It's very laid back and the service is very accommodating and fun. Here you'll see small groups of girls/women dining, and a multitude of couples. I definitely recommend the bruchetta and grab a glass or two of wine.  They have a large screen playing movies (last time I was in it was playing Lebowski...so PLUS!) and the whole ambiance/design/decor what have you is relaxing, rustic, and unique. A great place for lunch or dinner. They also had some good tunes playing. Very urban rustic casual...if that even makes sense. check it out!

This place has very tasty food and a good little atmosphere, as well as stocked with good beer.HOWEVER I think it is a little over priced for a hot dog and beer joint. Also it is lacking in proper seating. Could be a lot more enjoyable with more atmosphere. If you don't mind paying a little extra and finding your own place to eat, then by all means enjoy these delicious hot dogs and (overpriced) drinks.

OK, so this place is not favorable. I do not want to incite any horror sensations. But this place brought unwanted objects in my food and a terrible case of stomach problems for a few days. Skip this place if you'er craving Thai, go elsewhere.

These guys are great. A little corner shop reminiscent of the bodegas of my native East Coast (that have delis inside) . These guys have a taco stand inside that has some of the best mexican food around IMO. The ingredients they use are top notch. Very tasty, very clean. Diamond in the rough.

I must admit that I have yet attend Robbies as a restaurant patron. As a bar, this place is pretty great. Most Thursdays-Saturdays its packed with college kids partying. It's a lot of fun and pretty crazy. They have an in door bar, two patio bars, a dance floor, beer tubs all over the place, and most everyone is dancing outside. Some nights it can get a little too rowdy for some people. But see how you hold up.  Sunday night they have live music and the place dies down big time, which is great if you love live music and a little peace with your beer. Usually it is some sort of acoustic set (very chill and laid back).  Other nights of the week it can get fun, especially when closing time hits, and I HEAR it's a great place to eat, but i'd save it for the drinking.  I recommend beer! or vodka redbull.

Breakfast or lunch this is your spot.   For breakfast I recommend getting one of their delicious healthy omelets. The hot Juan is a personal favorite. But they also make one with avocado that is equally delicious. For lunch I highly recommend one to get the chopped salad, truly delicious especially the pesto dressing. For dessert pick from any of the delicious cookies or pastries at the counter. Enjoy a mimosa from the bar to help your hang over on Sunday.  Very trendy atmosphere. Inside can get crowded but there is usually room outside, and in the cooler weather the dining experience becomes quite favorable. Perfect spot for a late Sunday morning or any lunch date. Check it out!
