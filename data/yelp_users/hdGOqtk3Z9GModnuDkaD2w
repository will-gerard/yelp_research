Great service and okay food. I ordered 5-Spicy level ( where 4 is Thai hot) and the food came out tasting sweet. I love La's Thai on McDowell and Hayden much better

Amazing sichuan place...I used to be a regular when I was in Phoenix. They used to make the best Kung Pao Tofu... But this time, I wanted to go with my current favorite sichuan dish.. dan dan noodles. They were amazing but I shouldn't have ordered them for lunch... they were no way enough for me.  As always, the service was fast and the food was tasty. Really miss this place.

Hands down 5 stars for this place. Whenever I visit Phoenix nowadays, this is a must go place!  The secret is a few scoops of curry sauce, few scoops of spicy thai, a dollop of garlic, a whole lot of dry pepper flakes, loads of veggies and a request to make it very well done....this place makes a mean stir fry!! I love it!! love it!! The problem is that I over eat and I am too sleepy to work afterwards.

Looks like yelping is not a very reliable way of finding a good place to eat in touristy spots! The service was slow but very friendly. The waitress was amazing and was apologetic for the delay. After a super long wait, the food finally arrived and it was pretty disappointing. It was not just mild...it was bland. Thai food can be anything but never bland... so disappointed.

Bought my car here in 2010. In the last 2 years...I've never wanted to go anywhere else. People are great and the service here is great. They saved me a lot of money by looking up the recalls for my car and sent me a day before my warranty expired to fix a lot of stuff on my car!!!  Overall... great shop where they know their VWs

As a vegan I discovered this gem! Great Pho with veggi broth and their pepper tofu is to die for!   If you go there don't forget to order their freshly Limeade...very refreshing!

Disappointed!  It used to be a 5 star place fore me...it's slowly going down hill. The portion sizes are down. I love to order their pepper tofu...I am getting a lot more rice that I used to...but the portion of the curry went down. So, I feel like I am eating just steamed rice.   Secondly... I heard a few complaints from my friends and ignored them... but I too had a rotten red bell pepper in my pepper tofu. Now I see the trend. Used to be a great place.

Great place to have nice cold one! Nowadays, with me getting old and friends buying houses in Gilbert, I think this will provide a great midway hangout spot.  The food was good and the beers were taststy and cold and the waiting staff were just great! I am trying to remember what I had that night... but...had too much that night to recollect anything.

If I like a restaurant, I make it popular. I have the habit of dragging all my friends to the places I like.This my mission with Fresh mint. As I have no friends in Scottsdale, I need help from fellow yelpers This place is real good!!   If you go to Fresh mint, make sure you try the fried rice in a clay pot...it stay hot for the whole time you eat it....tastes YUM!! Their fresh rolls are to die for... to top it all off, the service is just out of the world! Go there and I am sure you won't be disappointed.

I was a big fan of Char's on University and Rural. After they closed Char's, I had to search for another Thai Restaurant where food is not sweet.After quite a few disappointing trails, I finally decided to trust in random picks. That's when I googled for Thai food and found La Thai. After the first visit, I knew that I am going to be a regular. The first time, the food was tasty but not spicy and I had to spice it up a bit to match my taste. The cook/waiter remembered that and when I went there next time, they made sure that my food is extremely spicy... that's when I realized that my search is finally over. Now I have a thai place where I will be eating at least once every week!

I am addicted to Thai food and I get my regular fix is La's Thai. This time, we were around Chandler mall and wanted to try a new place. Though a bit pricey, the food was great and the portions are huge. I got Drunken noodles triple Thai hot and my wife got an Thai iced tea and Panang Tofu and we shared the vegetable tempura. The food was amazing...Panang Tofu was a bit flat but I have to blame myself as I didn't take the waitress' suggestion. By the time we were done, the owner came in and talked to us and gave a breif history of the foods we just had and asked us to watch the football game with him... I loved everything about the place...good food, friendly and attentive waitress and overall feeling that we are welcome at the place...  I am keeping one start till I try couple more things.

Great little Thai food joint. I tried their Panang curry with Tofu hotter than Thai hot. Though it wasn't as hot as I was expecting, it was pretty tasty. I wish they had their starter soup with Veggie broth just so a lot more people can have it.   It kind of frustrates me when I go to a Thai food place and food tastes sweet. Till now, it was only La's Thai that made the cut...Tasty Thai is a close second.

I rarely go to Indian restaurants. But this is a place I love to visit often. The food seems as if it was done with great interest. When u go there, order anything with rice. They cook it to perfection. I like their handi dishes a lot.  If there is one thing I can suggest, it is that they should stop adding food coloring to some of their dishes. No need to guild this Lilly!

Amazing Szechwan place!  This place is now on my itinerary.  The food tasted amazing and it was so cheap. I am so glad that unlike place in San Francisco they don't nickle and dime you by charging for rice per serving.  We ordered Hot and Spicy Tofu, Fried Chicken cubes with hot pepper and hot and spicy pork kidney. All the dishes were amazing and the waiting staff was super friendly... as with all the good food places, it's pretty packed at lunch so plan accordingly.

If you serve a good Veggie Pho you are in my good book. That's the only thing I tried at Pho Cao is their Vegetable Pho with vegan broth and it was just amazing. Add to this a very friendly and attentive service.. a definite 5 star candidate!!

Finally.... a good Dum Biryani in Tempe. Been to this place twice and twice I was place a couple of time and both times, I had good experience.  Dum Biryani, Mirchi Ka Salan were great. Pakoda and Manchurian were good.  The food was really good and I hear that their happy hours are good too! Should try it sometime soon!

Indo-Chinese cuisine is pretty popular in India especially in the South India. I've been wondering why there are so few of them here in the US when the Indian diaspora is increasingly south India. If you are expecting the American chinese or real chinese cusine, you will be very disappointed.. but if you know what Indo-Chinese tastes like.. this place is pretty close to what it should be.  Went here with a big group and tried almost everything on the Menu... loved their appetizers, and all their fired rices tasted similar. Their spice level is pretty mild and the sauces that they put on the table are very tasty. I am sure it's not the food you should be eating all the time being deep-fried and all but it's a great guilty pleasure if done once in a while.  The service was good albeit a little slow. The restaurant get packed so, having a reservation definitely helps.
