I absolutely loved this place. Our server Jeremy was beyond amazing and helpful. Our food was over the top amazing. We had the four course meal and every course was delicious. The cheese was a great start and I loved the apples. Cesar salads had great flavor. We ordered the classic meal for dinner which had a great variety and tastey sauces for us to dip out meats in. Dessert......OMG!!!!! Words cannot describe how good it was. We will be back. I give this place top ratings!!!

Came for dinner tonight waited 15 minutes and no one came to our table. I love the food here but the last two times I've been here I've walked out because the service is horrible. Not impressed.

Absolutely amazing place to bring your family. It's not just great produce and fun picking the fruit it is an experience. The baked goodies are amazing and yes they do run out or you may have to wait for an item, that's because of the quality of their treats.   I highly recommend Schnepf Fatms to anyone. They are super fun during their events but yes you should be prepared to wait in lines. This is not Disney land where they can accommodate a large number of people. Items do sell out and there are rude customers there that don't understand all the work and everything that goes into their amazing events.   I will be enjoying Schnepf Atms with my kids over and over again year after year.

They say they open at 11 on Sunday's however I went there at 11 hoping to tan quick before I went on with my day. Well no one was there. So I waited and waited and waited. This is not the first time I've got there right when they claim to open to wait 15-20 minutes before they really open. Once my sessions are used I will not be back. The beds are ok. Nothing special unless your going to the Scottsdale location. Then they have an amazing high intensity bed. The Tempe location....just ok.

Absolutely amazing. The view is to die for. Right under camelback mountain. We sat on the patio and it was just relaxing and beautiful. The service was also top of the line. Our server was very attentive and the staff helped with clearing out table and refilling water. The whole team worked together so we had an amazing experience!  The food also was great!!!  I had the Cobb salad. It was fresh and I loved the dressing. My friend had soup of the day and the Cesar salad. I will be back. It's a great place to dine!

I love how fresh the food is. The vegetables taste as though they were just picked. The sauce is flavorful and the kids menu is perfect.

Brought my kids to see Santa at 7pm and because we weren't there at 1230 to get tickets my kids couldn't see him and left bawling!!!  We went last year and didn't need tickets so we had no clue we needed them. The managers were beyond rude and had no customer service. We have frequented this store quite a bit however we will never go back and we will let others know about the horrible experience we had tonight!

Food was good. Chips were crushed and salsa tasted like pickles but everything else was great. I love the game system on the tables. Perfect way to keep kids busy while waiting for food. Server Nate was excellent.

Amazing place to watch the packers!!!!  Being from WI I love my Packers. This bar is the closest thing you can get to being at a WI bar back home. The crowd cheers, they have prizes, bloody bar and the game is visible from every seat in the house. If you love the Packers this is the place to be.   You even get kick off cheese!!!

The sports department here is a joke. My daughter plays volleyball and last season we had issues with our coach which was our first let down by the Y. The director made it right though. The tournament at the end of the season was so unorganized. Our coaches never got notified there was a tournament and then everything was very last minute so we ended up missing it because we already had plans. So we decided to play another season as we have an amazing coach now. However it's Friday and we were just notified today our game time is changed. Again not ok. We make plans on the weekends and I have more then one child in activities. So changing the game time the day before the game is not acceptable. The scheduling of the games for the Y is horrible. If you have nothing to do on the weekends then sign your child up here. Otherwise I recommend somewhere else.

Horrible place to bring your kids. They go thru teachers like it's no ones business. The staff they had over a year ago was amazing. Now they are rude and could careless about what's going in. Ms Keisha is wonderful however the other director is rude and cares about herself. She doesn't talk to the kids or play with them. A year ago I'd say this place was feast. Now I'd say go anywhere else but there. I pulled my kids out of there and I now have stability for my kids vs random people in and out.

Would not go here unless you absolutely have to. I saw Dr Vegh and she was wonderful. Checked up on me and made sure all my needs were met. Her staff however sucked!!  I called the office multiple times with serious questions and concerns and no one would call me back. So I would end up calling a nurse at the ER. Their voicemail states that if you call before a certain time they would call you back the same day. Well they don't call back. The office is nice and clean but the staff needs a lot of work!  I give this place two stars only because the doctor I saw was very good.

My kids and I love going out for frozen yogurt and we frequent zoyo often. Tonight I'm having 6 girls stay at my house and they are playing cupcake wars. I stopped in to grab a gift card for the winner when then owner/manager started talking to me. He was super friendly and very nice. We love the yogurt here and the staff is amazing!!!!

Food tasted ok. Nothing special. The menu had maybe 10 items on it. Service was ok. Highlight was the lady making the balloon hats. She was amazing. Kids meals were almost $9 and nothing exciting. Atmosphere was dead. The Senor Frogs we've previously been to were amazing. This one sucked. Wouldn't recommend or go back.

Staff was very friendly. Ali gave me a microdermabrasion and she was amazing. Explained to me what I needed that would benefit me but wasn't pushy at all.  My skin feels amazing. I highly recommend going to Ali for any skin care need.

The selection of sushi is AMAZING. We tried a few different rolls and lived them all. The server was so friendly and explained to is what was good and if we liked certain styles what would be best to order.   This place is great and I would highly recommend it. I have seen them on groupon as well but with or with out it I'm there.

This branch is a joke. I came in with coin from cleaning out my car. They rudely told me they couldn't accept my coin unless it was rolled. Then handed me a tray to roll it. Last I checked I was at a bank where that's their job. Not impressed. I remember why I don't use that location. Every time it's something with them.

The food is amazing. So fresh and healthy. The juice is freshly squeezed and tastes amazing. I've had many different dishes here and have yet to be disappointed. They are so axing lunch time gets really busy so if your in a hurry make sure you call in your order. I highly recommend going here.   The staff are always friendly and offer great help if you can't decide what to order.

Absolutely love climbing this mountain. It is not for beginners or kids!!!!  I hate coming out here and seeing little kids when there is no way they could possibly hike this with out an adult carrying them. Also beginners should pick a different mountain. Seeing someone with their foot snapped in half or someone having a heat stroke is not fun. Bring lots of water, go early before its hot and be careful.

Wouldn't even rate them one star. Worst customer service ever. Plus they tell you one thing and when that doesn't happen and you call back they tell you something completely opposite. Happened to me three times. Do NOT use Cox!

The food here is beyond amazing. Everything is fresh and the flavors are on point. The menu has a good selection of things to choose from. The kids menu also has great healthy choices.  We loved everything we ordered, Philly cheese steak, chicken and shrimp, soup salad & a club and the kids grilled chicken meal.  The service here however is horrible. We had three adult meals and a kids meal. We got the kids meal after we were done eating our dinner. We asked for ketchup, salt and an extra plate all which we got after we were done eating. Also we ordered corn which we didn't get a spoon to eat it with.  The manager did come over and take the kids meal off our bill and sent us home with chocolate cake which was nice.  So good food and nice manager. Service not too hot!!!

I love the pick two combo. I had the cauliflower soup with a power salad. The food was all fresh and they prepare it for you as you order. I loved the chocolate dipped strawberry that comes with your meal!!  The desserts looked amazing. If I wasn't beyond full I could've had a hard time choosing between them. They were nicely displayed. The staff was also great. The store is new so I figured there may be some kinks but everyone worked together and they were all so friendly.   Highly recommend going here!!! It's nice to have a place like this in Chandler!
