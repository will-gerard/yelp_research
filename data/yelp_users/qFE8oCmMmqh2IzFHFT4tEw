These guys do awesome work. I waited a little longer than I wanted for my car but quality work takes time. I wouldn't go anywhere else. I have dealt with a lot of shops and these guys are by far the best. I won't go anywhere else in the future. Phillip is the man. He took awesome care of me and worked with me. I can't thank him enough. You guys are the best!

I was in there on 5/17/14 at 6pm the male bartender was changing the Patron Chiller with 2 Big bottles of Patron. One side would not take anymore tequila so he jams his fingers into the hole on top of that machine were the liquor goes. If you want Patron that has had dirty fingers in it this is your bar. Then I called to speak to a Manager and the Girl who answered was extremely rude asking me why I wanted to speak to a General Manager. She said they were busy. So from the time I left to 5 minutes later when I called a tour bus must have stopped by and dropped off a bunch of people cause it was dead when we were in there 5 minutes prior to the call. So I will just let everyone know my experience instead of the General Manager. Would not recommend..
