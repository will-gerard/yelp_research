I love Goldie's! Great casual sports bar. Must haves are the Monaco Focaccia, the Grilled Artichoke, and Spinach and Mushroom pizza.   Staff is always nice. They love there regulars here. Even if your not a regular you will get awesome service. Sunday mornings are always crazy in football season.

The ladies here always do a really nice job and try to engage with the customer. Not a bad price for Scottsdale either.

Every time I get groceries from here they expire that day after. We bought linch meat and cheese and we got home looked at it again and it's open and moldy. This has happened several time. I only get fresh produce or cheap vitamins from here.

Ling and Louie's is Asian meets American. Always great. Happy Hour is awesome. Calamari, lettuce wraps, and Sushi rolls are to die for. Atmosphere is always up beat. They have such a great variety of drinks from beer to liquor to wine. You can tell the Owner/Chef or managers, really care about your experience.

I like the Tavern Grille mostly because it's a sports bar that gives a little more variety in their menu. Food is always great here. Service is okay. If your still hungry after sitting there for fifteen minutes waiting on someone to acknowledge you then this is the place for you. That's the only down fall to Tavern Grille.

Lived here for three years and management has changed about three times. Paying way to much for there refinished apartments that have just been painted and new handles on the kitchen doors. Management is not the best.

Scottsdale brewing company has mastered the craft of brewing beers to appeal to the local cliental. Their restaurant space appeals to large parties and a couple small booths. It also has a large bar to where you can just stop to have a beer after work. As for its prices, it took a risk and featured a scratch menu which is fresh but you pay for it. With a menu that's basic bar food, it's nothing that's going to turn heads. The beer and atmosphere are awesome.
