I am so confused by all of the ratings. I've tried this place twice now hoping that things would be better and that I just ordered the wrong items but I was, yet again, very disappointed. The only thing this place has going for itself is that they have large portions.  As for the food, it should be called Tex"ass" Grill!  First time I visited, my boyfriend and I ordered the ribs meal. The ribs were dry and extremely salty. The sides weren't any better either. Their potatoes were bland and coleslaw was over-dressed.   Seeing the highly rated reviews on their Chicken Fried Steak, I hoped my most recent visit would bring redemption to this restaurant, but, boy was I wrong!  Their Chicken Fried Steak was bland as was their gravy and mashed potatoes! They didn't bother to season the meat and it seems like it was just dredged in season-less flour batter. The gravy was flavorless as well.   I really wanted to like it but my taste buds fought against me. I felt dirty trying to take another bite because I kept trying to fool myself into thinking I tasted the meat... or the batter... or the gravy... or the potatoes. My last bite of redemption... the biscuit.... which was also flavorless! What happened to buttery, flaky biscuits? They would be well inclined to consult the Pillsbury Dough Boy for some pointers because those taste 100% better.  Disappointment and empty stomachs filled my household for the rest of the evening. At least something was full.

Didn't get to play this game but I will definitely be back for it! Looks awesome! #shootemup #master  I also prefer the atmosphere and customer service at this location over the one on Desert Ridge.   My only complaint is that they need more airhockey machines!

DO NOT BOOK EVEN IF YOU'RE DESPERATE! If I could give it no stars, I would! I have never stayed in such a filthy and disgusting place in my life! I wouldn't stay here if it were FREE!!!   We went here for a short one night trip to Phoenix while we were looking for apartments to rent out and nothing worked! We made a complaint to the manager (and then had to call customer service who did NOTHING!) about the facility because of the rude service we encountered when we informed them of the numerous long, red hairs (I have brown hair!) that were found in our towels and cold shower that I had to take because the water wasn't working. The manager then went on to say that "they were embedded in the wash." I uploaded pictures of the towels but we'll see if they post them. They were not embedded but rather picked up from the ground and re-folded after the previous guest used them.   The company stands behind certain "standers" and the first core value that was stated on their "plaque" of promises wasn't upheld. We didn't receive the "warm hospitality and clean comfortable rooms where everything work[ed]" and even though our expectations were not met, [our] needs [were not met] in a timely manner" (Days Inn Promise from plaque).   They gave me a measly 25% discount and mocked me when I demanded my money back. The room wasn't clean or ready for us so why should I pay for less than mediocre service and accommodations which could have made me sick!?!?!?!   How are they still in business!?!?!?!?

Great place to shop and a lot of variety. I prefer this outlet over the newer Glendale one because it actually has some shade and better stores. Something the developers should have been more mindful of considering we are in Arizona.
