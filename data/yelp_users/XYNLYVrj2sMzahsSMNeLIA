Best Chinese food ever! My family and I love this place. We might even call this our home away from home haha. My boyfriend and I first discovered this quaint little restaurant a year and a half ago and we have been coming back ever since, sometimes 2 or 3 times a month. The parking is adequate, the food is amazing, and the staff goes above and beyond to make you feel welcome. I absolutely love the moo goo gai pan and egg drop soup. My boyfriend can't get enough of the kung pow cabbage. My children ( ages 3, 5, 6) always eat the sweet and sour chicken and they actually like the egg rolls, which is a huge win. The prices are almost unbelievable for the amount of food you get. The portions are huge, you will always have leftovers. Also, they have the most genuinely friendly staff who are willing to make any accomodations to please you. Everything about this place is perfect. What I like most is that I can always count on having a pleasant time filled with great food and service when I eat here. There are some restaurants I enjoy eating at but I never know what kind of service I'm going to get or how well my food will be prepared because the staff is always different. The Grand Dragon has consistently provided the best service to my family and I for over a year and I would recommend them to anyone.

This shop has wasted my entire day and caused me a lot of unnecessary stress. The staff is completely incompetent and lack integrity. I do not trust the mechanics to touch my car again. Nobody knows what they are doing there. The mechanics and the guys in the shop are just as confused about what one another is doing as they are about what they themselves are doing. I will never come here again and wish I could get back all the time and money I've put in here.

Awesome customer service! Hands down, best liquor store. I'm definitely making this my 'home' liquor store even on those rare occasions that it happens to be out of the way, its worth it! Ive been through here a few times in the past but may or may not have had a little too much to drink and dont recall the experience. However, the fact that they deliver has always made them stand out in my mind. So Friday night on my way home from a family dinner I drove through to get myself some Dos Equis and the man at the window was extremely helpful and pleasant. My boyfriend drinks non alcoholic beer but doesn't like the taste of Odoules, after explaining this the man brought out another brand that happens to be my boyfriends favorite. He had a nice little casual conversation with us and then gave all three of my children some candy. I was surprised by how friendly and patient he was with us, especially on a friday night.

All I can say is, read the reviews because they are not lying. I wish I would have read the reviews before going here but we were in a hurry to get home and this happened to be the first DQ we saw on the way. When we pulled in it was really dark and had a strange feeling about the location. There were no cars ahead of us yet when we pulled up it a took a while for the employee to greet us. Once she did we had to repeat ourselves 5 times before she finally told us to just go to the window because she couldn't hear us. Once we got to the window we ended up having to repeat ourselves another 3 times before she finally repeated our order correctly (which was a small snickers blizzard, small fries, and a $1.89 vanilla cone dipped in chocolate). First she handed us a tiny vanilla cone so we handed it back to her telling her we wanted the 1.89 cone dipped. She took the cone and brought the same one back only dipped in chocolate then handed us the blizzard and told us to wait for the fries. We ended up waiting an additional 5 minutes just for the fries. We would have just left had we not already paid. I would not recommend an establishment with incompetent employees and terrible service such as this. It was as if the employees did not want customers because they didn't want to atually have to do their job. I wouldnt be surprised if they were doing drugs in the back
