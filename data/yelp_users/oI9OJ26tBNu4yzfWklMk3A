Checked this place out for the first time today as I have been stalking nail salon reviews for a few weeks now, trying to find a place closer to home and cheaper (without sacrificing quality & experience) than my usual place.    I have to say, I was pleased with my experience!    Separate, dedicated reception space makes a world of difference on initial impression, and I think that helps them be able to recognize you've arrived and therefore greet you almost immediately.  The whole place was very clean and did not have a strong chemical smell.  The woman who checked me in directed me to pick a color and before I had made a selection, they were already ready for me; which was nice because I always feel awkward when I am ready and they haven't told me where to go (which I don't think would be an issue here because as I said, they have a dedicated reception/lobby sitting space).   Pricing was really good for what they offer you: a fully-functional and not-over zealous massage chair while they give you a thorough salt scrub, calf/foot massage, paraffin wax on your feet, brief hot stones before they do the hot towel part to get off excess oil/lotion, and of course the detailed nail care.   I paid less for the above mentioned here than I normally do at my regular price, and they don't use the hot stones at all.   It seemed that this place uses the hot stones regardless of what pedicure you get (they have three options - basic, luxury, and VIP).    Overall, I will definitely be back, probably with my husband to get his opinion (as we normally get our pedicures together ) at least one more time before I determine if this is my new place.

Poor customer service.  Our tech barely told us anything when we dropped the car off to him, except that the "service manager will be right with us".    "Right with us" turned in to 1/2 hour wait without having anyone even say one word to us.  I watched 3 techs work on one car and another sit in the lobby on his phone.   Jiffy Lube is supposed to be quick and this was anything but.    We finally "interrupted" the guy on his phone to ask if since they hadn't even started on my car, if we could just take it and come back later (I had to work soon).   All of a sudden, there was a rush to get me done.   And we still suffered the poor customer service from the service manager that rushed through his apologies while answering the phone multiple times & cutting our conversation short.   Next time, I'll make the appointment at the dealership.

I'm more than a little shocked at the negative reviews on here...  Some of them seem reasonable (pushy on cash tips, excessive upsell, maybe even the ones that say they felt rushed/hurried) but others seem a bit far-fetched...  I have been coming to this salon for a bit more than 6 months now and have never had a negative experience.  I had been going to a place in Scottsdale, that I was loyal to, but when they closed I decided to try 7 Day since some of my friends had regular check-ins here.    First off, I was paying $35 out-the-door (service, extras, tip) for my old pedicure place and the service there was hit & miss, but overall, okay.   Here, I pay $35 for the #2 pedicure (different scents/oils available) and get way more bang for the buck!  Longer massage than any other place I've been to, essential oils/scrubs, thorough work, complimentary bottles of water, massaging chairs that ACTUALLY WORK (how many places can you say have massaging chairs that actually do what they're supposed to?!?)  This place even has massage chairs for the waiting guests!  TONS of nail techs always working and a very relaxing environment.  :)  My most recent experience was by far the best - ask for Kathy to do your pedicure.  She spent more time on my nails, focused on where I needed the massage (usually they do just anterior muscles, I prefer posterior "calf" muscles), gave me a rockin' paint job (that she made sure *i* thought was perfect) before letting me leave, AND gave me a second top coat after I was already drying (though, I'll admit that one is probably because I tipped generously.) Hey, when you give that much attention to SOMEONE ELSE'S feet - you deserve it!!!

So I feel the need to update this review because I have been coming here for about 5 years now and can honestly say it's overall one of the best nail places I have ever been to.  And yes, I have tried other places.    I love coming here because the nail care is exceptional & they take their time.   This is not a good spot for a quick in-and-out service.  I mean, they'll do a basic polish change or pedi if you want that, but it's really worth it to make the time to get one of the specialty pedicures.  $46 for exceptional nail care, sugar scrub, callus remover, paraffin wax, decent length massage, with an aromatherapy factor?  So worth it!!  I have several technicians that I have had help me over the years, and really, they're all pretty good.  Everyone has their favorites of course, but I haven't walked out of there unsatisfied with any one technician.  A lot of them even know me & my husband when we walk in and come say hi.   Since my initial review, I have brought all of my girlfriends, my family, and even some co-workers to 7 Day Spa -- all of which return.  That should tell you what you need to know about this place.   Things you should know:  - they are always busy.  Don't let that dissuade you. If they ask you to go pick polish, take your time and they will be with you before you have a chance to look at all the colors.   - they do ask that you tip in cash.  Come prepared because there are no exceptions to that (ATM on site but who wants to pay ATM fees?).  - the guys do great nails too!  Some people are concerned when a man does their nails for whatever reason, but this place does have a lot of male technicians and they do a great job with both nail care & polish (they can even do pretty designs!). - the owner is basically always here and he is constantly making sure his employees are doing a good job & being professional.  If he comes up to your nail tech while they are working with you, don't freak out & think they are talking about you.
