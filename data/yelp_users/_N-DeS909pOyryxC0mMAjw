What a gem. This place is just true blue delicious.  Let me put it like this, everytime I have gone there for some reason a bunch of Firefighters were eating there. Firefighters love good food and eat a lot but do not make a lot of money. If this place fits their needs then it exceeds mine.  I always get one of the Tortas and usually take a few Churros with dulce de leche filling.  This place is just genuine.

La Grande Orange is one of those places that I like so much yet due to so many others liking it forces a strain on my ability to like it.  Allow me to explain. Everything on the menu and in the store is a solid quality product. If it is something to be eaten then it is delicious. If it is something to buy and use in some other form or fashion then it is more than likely a great at whatever it is.  The area where liking La Grande Orange becomes a challenge is that it is always soo overcrowded with customers that the lines and wait for orders can be pretty long. The parking lot is ridiculously small and fills up fast and is almost always full with one or two cars already camping out for a spot.  That said, my mouth and stomach convince me that this place is just too good to give up on.  I have been living in Dallas, TX most recently and have thought about how nice it would be to have a La Grande Orange out here. With all of the people recently relocating to the Dallas area maybe those who run LGO should consider placing a location out here.

I was recommended this place by a local foodie who is very picky. He swears by the place so I trusted him.  The location is nice, and pretty cool inside. The menu is impressive and has a lot of cool ideas. The food that I ate however was not any good.  I paid so much to get so little and what little I got was not impressive at all. I was actually embarrassed as I brought a few friends from out of town there and they also thought the food was gross. I felt like they would never trust my judgement again.

This place has some of the best chimichangas in Arizona.  I love how crappy the building is because it makes the food so much better. I think pretty much everyone I have ever taken to this place got nervous about what was about to happen at first glimpse of the building.  All have left happy to know the place existed and instant fans of the food.

Dr. John Holmes is a true hero!  I am so pleased with the level of expertise he brinded down on my wife and I as we worked through our first pregnancy. He was so considerate and patient with us.   In fact we had seen four other Doctors prior to him in an attempt to identify the source of pain my wife was going through. The first four doctors excused my wifes claims impatiently and without taking thorough measures to identify the possible issue.  Dr. Holmes was very careful and listened. In very little time he discovered what the medical problem was and made it a priority of his to take care of it. It was because of this care that we were even able to have children. On top of all of this he delivered our first baby.  My wife and I are once again expecting but are in Dallas without a super hero doctor. I wish I could just fly my wife down to Mesa just so she could continue seeing Dr. Holmes as she was very comfortable with him.  Thanks for the great help Dr. Holmes, and to all of you in the Phoenix area make it a point to find out how great he is.

This Doctor really cares about his patients. I wish all the other doctors were as caring and thoughtful as he was with my wife. If you are in AZ and need a good OBGYN then you might give him a try.  We were new to the PHX area and had gone to 4 other OBGYNs' prior to Dr. Holmes and each one told my wife she was exagherating pain and said she was too young to have any serious complications. Dr. Holmes was the first to identify the signs of endometiosis and conducted the surgeory to take care of it.

Dr. Randy Leavitt is the best Doctor ever.  Not only did Gilbert Pediatrics provide the greatest level of care to my newborn, they went the extra mile with their compliments and customer service.  I actually owe many thanks to Dr. Leavitt and the people of Gilbert Pediatrics for taking a thoughtful moment and giving a very considerate and well thought recommendation for my wife as to which OBGYN she should see. Turned out to be one of the greatest suggestions as he discovered certain things early which allowed us to resolve a medical condition that would have become much worse.  Thanks again Gilbert Pediatrics and I highly recommend this as the primary choice for those of you in Gilbert.

No longer a believer in DDD.  I thought Guy Fieri was into good food. I used to look at the places his stomach would conquer in amazement and have even allowed my fat heart take trips out to some of those areas.  The fact that he has not stopped by Flancer's has burned a hole in whatever organ it is in our body that allows us to trust someones judgement.  I used to force people to drive from Scottsdale, Glendale, Goodyear, and Phoenix just to try Flancer's. They all became instant fans and the only complaint ever heard about the distance to get there was that our lunch break was not long enough to make it a lunch option.  Now that I am in Dallas, TX my wife and I find ourselves missing this place. The "We must meat I aint lion" sandwich is just so awesome.  Go to this place.

Nellos is perhaps one of the best pizza's per cost in Phoenix.  My wife actually prefers them over many of those up scale fancy pizza parlors.  Overall they have a very good consistency and have won my heart. Try their buffalo chicken pizza (I'm an anti chicken on pizza guy but this deserves an exception).

While living in Tempe for school I made several trips out to Vegas. Obviously getting out of boring old Phoenix was a must, but I am talking about driving all the way just for Rincon De Buenos Aires.  This place has great variety especially to those unfamiliar with Argentine cuisine. Their empanadas were exactly how I remember them to be when I lived down in Argentina.   I was so over joyed when I learned that the owners made their own chimichurri sauce. I ordered pretty much one of many things and a bunch of empanadas. All of the stuff I had was great.  I would love to make another visit soon.

This place is awesome!  They have homemade chimichurri! Milanesa! Empanadas! Alfajores! They even have Pomelo!  I stopped by this place a few times when I would drive from Phoenix up to SLC. Everytime I have made the pit stop to Rincon De Buenos Aires it has always been a real treat. Friendly people and great food.  If you are not familiar with Argentine cuisuine then let me recommend that you give this place a visit.

This place has a lot of great things going on. When you enter through the doors you might get a second thought about ordering food from what appears to be a mini mart for noodles and other random trinkets; don't be an idiot! Stay in line and get something,..anything,..it is all good.  I absolutely enjoyed their cheese steak sandwiches. The Italian sodas were always refreshing and they have so many other things.   Take a second to read the owners story it adds to the reason you will like this place.

Cheba Hut. I think this place is okay. The pokalolo was my favorite sandwich. I have gone into this place many times, but always felt like something was either missing or needed to change. I don't think I ever really picked up on what that thing was. I will say that there is a lot of people who love this place.   I think it is a bit overrated and got tired of the whole weed theme behind it. I also felt slightly disgusted by some of the people who made my sandwiches there (taking a shower is too mainstream for some of them).

I have been to this place a bunch. I like the idea the history and the atmosphere of a shack but this place is somewhat overrated.  To me the guacamole is what does this place in. I cant get over the use of  frozen artificial guacamole. The burgers are decent but could use a little improvement.  Over all I do like this place and may be harsh on the rating I wish I could give it at least three stars but I feel their overpriced for what they serve.

The pizza here is good, but my favorite thing they have on the menu is the meatball sandwich with the waffle fries.  This place is totally a local legend and most of the things I have had here were good. Great spot for a group especially when its not too hot and you want to sit outside. The service is pretty good and one thing I have always appreciated is that when waiting to be seated they give you complimentary fountain drinks,...maybe that isn't common but they did it for me a few times.

One of the greatest secrets of Arizona!  I surprised my wife by getting a casita for the weekend of her birthday. The staff were very helpful in making sure everything was set up just right and that we had a great stay.  The casitas are great for a romantic getaway on a budget. the whole property is so relaxing.

Great establishment and especially for it being a chain.  The place is clean and has a transparent kitchen allowing us patrons to know that the ingredients are in good standing. The prices are within good range and the seating makes it very convenient for groups.  I like their menu it's simple yet offers enough options to make it an agreeable spot.

I still remember the first time I walked in to try the sandwiches at Corleone's.  I stood there in front of the register gazing at the menu thinking about what I would or should or could order.   The guy with a military type buzz cut  interrupted unfocused decision making process asking me if this were my first time in. I responded saying yes and he immediately punched in a few buttons on the register as he told me what I would be having.  For a moment I though to myself "what a rude a-hole but then I thought well the guy knows whats good there and then I thought about how many times I wanted to just skip passed the silliness of dealing with indecisiveness of many people I had to work with and decided I liked that jerk who took my order.  I must say the order was definitely not what I would have ever chosen for myself but it was insanely good. It actually became the most common sandwich I would eat from that place. I introduced many people to this place and most feel the same that it is very good.  Now that I am here in Dallas, TX I have even recommended this place to friends out here when I found out they would be going out to Scottsdale for business. They ended up coming back bragging about how much they liked it.

Dr. Hiatt performed the LASEK surgeory on my horrible eyes.  I have had bad vision since I could remember, in fact I still remember I got my first pair of glasses at age 10 and it changed my world. I never knew you could actually see the individual leaves on trees from ten feet away. I got my first pair of contacts at age 12.  My first interest in corrective surgeory took place while in high school but was quickly shot down over the concerns I saw from a Dateline special.  It wasnt until I ran into a friend who had the procedure done before I was able to ask him about the experience and his own level of satisfaction before I sparked an interest. He explained the time and effort he had made in researching the best place to get the surgeory. Swagel Wootton Hiatt was his place of choice. and so I went in and started looking into it.  The people at S.W.H Eye Center were very professional, extremely informative about the process and risk. They made me sit down and take a test over the material I studied prior to even scheduling an appointment to know whether it would be possible for me to have the procedure.  I am in my second year after the surgeory and feel that this is one of the best things I have ever spent money on. My level of satisfaction has never been in question. My favorite is watching people struggle or complain about their contacts knowing that I no longer have to worry about that.  Thank you Dr Hiatt for the great vision!

I absolutely am a fan of this place.  Cheap prices great food and a clean atmosphere. I love the Cuban Torta. Order one up with a Mexican Coke and you should be in good shape.

Possibly the worse food in Tempe. Don't let the unwashed Cadillac and fancy tv screens trick you into assuming the food will be good.  I made the mistake once on my own, but the second time was due to a stubborn tourist relative who by looking at the outside just knew the place had to be amazing.  The first time I ordered a burger and chili cheese fries. The burger was something I would expect from a hospital and the chili served on top of the fries had cinnamon in it,... who the hell wants that in their chili? I didnt realize chili cheese fries was a dessert item.  The second time I was practically dragged into the place. I decided I would order a cheese-steak sandwich which was a huge mistake. The bread was disgusting and the meat was third class. I couldn't finish half of it.  The service was absolutely ridiculous. Funny thing is that I was sitting there for about 40 minutes waiting on the waitress. I finally grew impatient as my wife turned to me in pain and said she thought she was having contractions (she was 9 mos pregnant at the time).  I got up and had to bark at the waitress to ring me up and give me my card so we could leave. We actually ended up going to the hospital that night and had our baby that morning. I always joked about the long stairway up being what started her labor.

How this place is so loved and popular amongst so many in the Phoenix area astounds me. I love the idea of their food and hours they are open is awesome, but every time I have eaten at this low cost palace for late night cravings, I got real sick.  The food quality is low and the taste is nothing amazing. Either way certain conveniences about this establishment make it the ideal spot for high school and college kids so they will continue to thrive with little effort to providing quality.

Yes this place is good!  It has a great menu with new age ideas. It uses organic stuff and local ingredients. The sausage they use is very good.  I feel however that this place is slightly overrated as it is very hard to get a parking spot and table. I guess I just don't like being around a crowd much. Anyway my understanding is that the guy who runs this place is a nephew to the previous owners of Nello's  I would go back but this is more of a special occasion place for me simply because of the difficulty getting seated.
