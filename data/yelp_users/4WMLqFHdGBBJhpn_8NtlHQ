My family and I used to meet up at the Biltmore Chevy's for happy hour quite frequently and were bummed out when it closed. We went to the Arrowhead location for dinner Friday night and were sat right away, had excellent service, and delicious food. The waiter even brought my parents dessert for their anniversary. Surprisingly, one of the same employees was still working there and mentioned to me that our favorite waitress from the Biltmore location was still working for the company at the Mesa location. This is obviously a great company that hires great people! I expressed my compliments of the server to the manager because it was such a great experience. And the kiwi margarita was amazing!

Ulta has the best return policy! I took back my new favorite curling iron after it had cracked, and without a receipt or original packaging, and not even buying it at that particular Ulta, they took it back - no questions asked! I have had a great experience returning products at Ulta in the past and it's really refreshing to find a store that believes in customer service!

This has always been a last resort for me when re-selling my clothes. I will usually take my stuff to Plato's Closet, which gives the same in trade or cash, then Buffalo Exchange, then Other Mother's. The last few times I've cleaned out my closet, I've opted donating my rejects instead of re-selling to Other Mother's because they pretty much give you pennies for your items. Yesterday, I decided to try them out one more time and I was more insulted than ever. Taking two pair of name brand jeans, an unworn shirt with tags still on, and 5 pieces of jewelry...they gave me a whopping six dollars and some change in cash! I would much rather donate my clothes to someone in need than to get ripped off by this store ever again!

I love living here! It is quiet and the staff is amazing. Anytime I've needed anything, they've taken care of it on the same day. There has been no turnover and it's been great working with the same people consistently since I've lived there. They always go above and beyond; in fact, when I needed a jump for my car, a staff member was right there and ready to help. I would recommend this complex to anyone!

Dr. Van Sluyters is the best! The very first time I went to see him, my car wouldn't start when I was leaving and he tried to help me get it going! After that, I decided to become a patient for life :) Not only does he care about his patients, but he is personable, friendly, and his staff is amazing. His Office Manager, Heather, is super friendly and an absolute pleasure to talk to. I highly recommend this practice to anyone looking for a good dentist!

The pharmacy at this Target offers exceptional customer service! The pharmacist was extremely helpful, making sure that all of my transfers were being taken care of and was willing to go above and beyond to get one filled that was not ready. He was personable, knowledgeable, and seemed to really love his job! The only complaint I have is that this pharmacy seems to operate on more abbreviated hours than the other Target stores I've been a patron at.

I gave up Starbucks for lent, mostly to save money, and I decided to try this place, after passing it by several times. I've been here 3 times now and the staff are consistently friendly and they have hooked me up every time with some sort of discount! They have everything in a fat free, sugar free version also! It's my new favorite place!

This place has always had good food and good service, but in the past the service has been sort of slow when I've dined there during the lunch hour with larger groups. However, I have nothing bad to say about them after the visit I experienced this week. The food was excellent, the server was polite and attentive, and two different workers were constantly refilling drinks. On top of that, they were busy and still able to give us ample attention!

I have been going to this studio for a little over a year and I absolutely love it! The Sumits sequence is awesome, combining the best of Bikram and Vinyasa Flow. The heat makes it challenging and a great work-out for your mind, body, and soul! The owner, staff, and teachers are wonderful and make you feel like family :)

This place is insane. I know it's Chinese and all, but the woman answering the phone doesn't know a lick of English. We spent 5 min on the phone just trying to give an address. And that's 5 minutes of my life I will never get back. Then out of sheer frustration (and hunger), I hung up on the incompetent operator. She then proceeded to call back no less than 5 times. If you are hungry, don't call them. But if you want a good laugh, I highly recommend.

I have recently started going to Dave's Astanga Yoga for Yoga Teacher Training. I am so happy that I made the decision to attend Dave's studio. The owners, Dave & Cheryl, are kind, hands-on, and really care about the students. I feel very welcome and experience an amazing energy from those around me. They've done a great job of creating a culture that embraces all levels and I am confident that the knowledge I'm gaining from them will take me to the next level in my practice.

Weekend before last, I went in and saw a sign that said they had stopped selling for the night, so later that week, I called to see what the cut-off time was for bringing in clothes. I was informed it was 6PM and because I practice yoga in the evenings, it's difficult for me to make it there before that time. So I waited until the following Saturday, only to be informed that they aren't buying again until Monday. At this point, I was starting to get irritated, as I've sold at this location as well as the other two without this issue before. Anyway, I decided to stop in tonight because I was not going to yoga. I got there well before 6, but was faced with that familiar sign that they were no longer buying for the night. As my annoyance mounted, I patiently waited at the counter until I caught someone's attention. I was informed once again that they would be buying on Monday. So I explained how I had been in previously and called ahead and the owner piped up saying, "I am the owner and I set the hours." Oh no she didn't! So I let her know that she might want to inform her staff to explain the stipulations over the phone. She then ranted on about her inventory and how she's getting ready for 'back to school.' And i care because??? And as I turned on my heel to leave, the young, messy-haired girl at the counter said, 'Here's a coupon.'  Right. Like I'll be back for a 4th time; Three strikes - you're out...and outed on Yelp!

This is my new favorite place! Cheaper and better than Paradise Bakery! Bread is really soft, every meal comes with a chocolate covered strawberry, and you can make your own Italian sodas! The service is also friendly and fast!

I had been told how amazing the food was, so I think I was slightly disappointed. However, it WAS good, just not life changing...but the thing that set this place apart was the service! I felt like I was in a sit-down restaurant. The cashier was very nice and personable, came to check on us, and it was extremely clean and well-decorated. It did not feel like a fast food joint.

Alison Trumbull is the best! Not only is she knowledgeable about Pilates, but she is a trained ballerina and yoga instructor, so you will get a really well-rounded workout with her. She has awesome equipment that makes working out fun. If you're looking to tone up and feel good while having a blast, go see her at Studio Allonge!
