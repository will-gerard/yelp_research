This is what heaven would taste like if heaven had a taste... hands down my favorite Mexican joint in town, I have not had a bad thing on the menu. The people who run this place are impeccably nice, and always respectful. Listen if you want a bad burrito that tastes like Chef Boyardee, go to taco bell... you want the real deal! come here.

First go around, when buying from this company was awesome... that's because the sales guy that I worked with the first time, was a gentleman and a scholar (his name is cliff and he doesnt work there anymore). The next time, the sales guy was ok, not great, English was not his first language so the language barrier was there, not a deal breaker by any means.   The horror begins after you drive off the lot. Listen when you tell me you are going to give me a deal, and tell me that this is bottom dollar what you are going to pay! I expect you as a person to honor that word... This place has gone downhill since the fire, The all mighty dollar is what runs this place now, and not integrity... I get it, its a business... but a shady one at that...  Steer clear, you can find better places to work with.

I love this place, my favorite Mexican joint in Arizona. Hours and days are a little screwy, so make sure that the place is open before you go, otherwise this place is awesome.

Do you like people talking through your movie, what about kids texting through an entire movie, or trashy people giving their own commentary? well then come on in, this place will be a wonderland to you! Come try the 10 dollar stale popcorn, the abysmal customer service, or maybe even the sticky floors EVERYWHERE.... you'll think you were walking in O.J. Simpsons ex wife house...   Come enjoy the worst theater in Arizona. Stay White Trashy!

I am most likely bias, but I love how quiet it is. They don't try to sell you anything while you are working out. The staff is super nice and is very supportive. Not terrible pricing, but manageable. Well if you don't like this gym you can always slap a planet fitness sticker on the back of your 97 Honda civic... but don't expect anyone to take you seriously after that.

I have always looked at this joint and thought, " meh one day " well today was that day... They had my favorite brew on tap, and as I walked in seen oysters sitting on ice, on display. I thought " I'm gonna like this place". The wait staff is the definition of customer service (Amanda was my server). Then the food came, papadeux's was my favorite place in town. Tonight that changed. Arrogant butcher! You win. Job well done. Will be back shortly

you ever had your taste buds slap you in the face and ask you. "I am not sure what you are feeding me? but don't you stop!"  Fuzzy's is my all time favorite taco joint, everything from the margaritas to the SOFT SHELL tacos!, don't do the hard shells. the taco sauce is so good, you could drink it.   If i could eat here every day i absolutely would, worth it! eat here!

I honestly cannot say enough good things about this place. The first time we walked into this place, I got to admit the building is kind of sketchy looking. The old saying stays true, NEVER judge a book by its cover, this is the most authentic Thai food I have ever eaten, And when you order it Hot, They actually make it hot!, Seriously I had to go outside to cool down (it was 110 out that day). The staff is some of the nicest people I have ever met, and consider them friends now. This place truly is a diamond in the rough and is one of my top restaurants in AZ

The food here was really good, and I really have no complaints. Wasn't wowed by any means, but wasn't disappointed either.   I will come back when I am in the neighborhood, I do recommend this place over Joe's but not over Hot and Juicy
