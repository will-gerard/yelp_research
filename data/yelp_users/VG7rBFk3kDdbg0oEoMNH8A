No draft beer or even any beer for a froday!!! You can't get a burro enchilada stable either. Poor service also!

Amazing atmosphere with trendy designs  inside and out!! Pool is outside in the middle of hotel so you feel very secluded and private while soaking up the sun  Award winning beer and eats also along with life changing rooms at an exceptional price!!!

This place is terrible!!!! They make you wait outside in the heat because the place is so small!!! All this outdoor seating and no mister system!!! Menu is very limited and you cannot separate checks!!! I wouldn't be coming here if it wasn't for the other half family wanting to eat here!!! Terrible, just terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!

Good place for beer. But horrible management and there are so many open tables it's ridiculous.  The food is good too but like I said, lack of proper planning with clearing off tables and sitting people!?!!?

Great customer service with a down home feeling. Volkswagen has always made a quantity and affordable vehicle. Free food while you wait, free loaner car and free shuttle service!

There is no traditional Mexican food even close to the "life changing" feeling your body and soul experiences at Rito's!!!!!  I suggest any burrito made enchilada style with two mouth watering tacos!!!!! This place is LIFE CHANGING!!!! Owners all the way down to the individual who thankfully accepts your money is all family!! I felt at home!!!!!

The most amazing, professional, personable and down right cool barbers!!! Best fades given in the great state of Arizona!!  Owner Yolanda did it right with the shop layout, prices and unique yet talented staff!!! Being law enforcement, I need a haircut every 10 days. Sr's Barbershop is always available to keep a hood man looking supa fly and down right sexy!!!! I've been to hundreds of barbers throughout the United States and Sr's is the best!!! I'd even pay $50 for a cut!!! Check them out! You won't be let down!!!

Like I've said before; local, organic, fresh, and all natural "life changing" food with outstanding employees coupled with soul moving customer service makes this place a must have!!! For breakfast, try the Devils Mess or the Biscuits and Gravy with chorizo sausage. I guarantee you'll want to be a better person and outperform your staff at work!!!! 80% off your dollar stays here!! Please tip generously as the bigger the tip, the better you impact lives and win assist workers with personal enrichment!!! Breakfast, lunch, or dinner/happy hour, this place outperforms al other local cafes!!! Local beer too!!!! Live love love this place!!
