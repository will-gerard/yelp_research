I've been here before but this last time I went sucked. Why you may ask?It was the waiter being rude, ignoring me, & food was cold. Plus he kept looking at me every time he passed by our table. Not checking me out or flirting but ugly looks. He's lucky I didn't have a little walk with him outside the ihop for disrespecting me. Lucky for him I was with my sister.

Prices here are crazy high for being a big lots. I'll give them that the store inside looks nice and they have many things to choose from compare to other big lots, but $15 for a pillow? When I can get the same one at Target or Walmart..Methinks not.

A few years back I went for an L.A. dodgers sign. They charged me around $70. The guy showed me the design on paper and I said it was ok just to have it outlined and then pepper shade on the outside. When he was done it wasn't what he showed me. I remember him telling me "hey if you need a touch up or fix come back" wtf? lol why would you need to redo it unless you f****d up. I left and went back to L.A. I come back and forth between phoenix and L.A. Today I found the place and went to talk to them to fix it or give me my money back. I don't care if it was a long time ago. The guy says there's a new owner and he doesn't remember a guy with the description I gave him. To fix the tattoo they f****d up in the first place was going to cost me $130. No thanks..I rather go to West Side Tattoos. I recommend them especially for black and grey urban style tattoos. I will upload the tattoo they did of my L.A. My real rating is -0 but the lowest is 1 star.  -Tattoo slanted  -Lines not same size all around -Shading not what was requested -Shading done poorly

I just left this place with my cousin and I've seen better places in California. I'll give them that the females are worth the 5 stars but them them being stuck up, place is small, with no private rooms, and loud music me thinks not. They were only half naked and even their nipples had paint on them what the hell? lol.

I went with my sister 2 days ago. It was my first time eating Famous Dave's. I got a hamburger and got some mac & cheese. They were both okay, I tasted better. Now the hot wings & onion rings were better. the place was packed we sat outside.

I remember Lenny's from 2003 on 27ave & Glendale. One of the first places in AZ that reminded me of some good burgers back home in L.A. I heard they opened one in central Phoenix so I had to stop by. I noticed they have a new look and their menu has so much stuff compare to the first place. Wtf?! holding out on us on the west of Phoenix? Well it's okay I forgive you guys, I seen they are remodeling the one on 27ave & Glendale same look and menu better be the same :)

No breakfast?..really? Well that gets -2 out of the 5 stars and -2 because of the 2 times I went and got my order wrong and one time at night time they took so long to ask for my order. it looked like they were closed but no they were just chilling inside side, I had to go to the window and tell them what's up? You guys rich you guys don't need to get my order anymore? Haha I only come for the biscuit and gravy which they don't sell so bye.

I never ate here until last week. I'm picky on the wings, for me they have to have the right sauce and enough meat. Well I came here and ordered the bbq boneless wings and they are bomb! I mean good! The fries are okay too but I think they add sugar on them and that's weird. Other than that it was good. I also tried some of the hawaiian flavor wings but I didn't like them. They kind of tasted like the chinese sweet and sour chicken.

I went with my sister like 2 hours ago. I got 1 al pastor taco and another shrimp taco. They were both good, the only thing was that within 30 seconds the tortilla got cold. So 4 stars for you :)

It's right next to the mall and some other stores and restaurants. It's open 24 hours so that's good if you need a pack of condoms real cheap lol. I did see they change stuff around so I just had to get use to where everything was but over all it's a great Walmart.

Best car wash please in AZ! I went yesterday and get the $20 unlimited for each month and it's well worth it with all the things you get for 30 days! Do the math you normally pay $5 each weekend times 4 = $20 with with their unlimited you can go every day or Friday, Saturday and Sunday always looking clean and smelling good!  My package:  Scented Soaps Soft Foam Scrubs Spot Free Rinse Rim & Tire Scrub Clear Coat Protection Triple Foam Polish Undercarriage Power Wash Turtle Ice Wax/ Paint Protectant Rime & Tire Cleaner Choice of Air Freshner Tire Shine

I went yesterday after noon to the mall and then here. My first time eating at five guys burgers and fries. I this is what I got and recommend  cheeseburger with lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, grilled onions, ketchup, mustard with regular fries cajun style  The cheeseburger is in between and in&out burger and a culver's burger. And they fries are very good, even though they look dry. Put some ketchup on them fries because they have a very strong flavor. And finally the soda machine lol I seen that on tv and funny that after me there was 2 teenagers and they guy was what the?....vanilla coke? and i can pick more flavors? He was so surprise that he started talking to the female about it and saying can you believe that?lol wow. And is it me or my lol look like a drowning guy LOL

I came with my sister yesterday. I've been here before so I already knew what to get and what not to get. As you can seen in the reviews below me, there is sushi included. The people that work there are very nice and helpful.

I just left from here and I don't know what you people are talking about and this having almost 5 stars or an A inside the business. This smells like sewage all over the place I could not be inside for 1 full minute. I walked out I can't believe people can eat inside with that smell in the air. I ordered an al pastor taco since I was there and yup just like I guessed it was nasty. Tortilla was cold no flavor and small for I think 1.50 You people on here don't know what's good tacos LOL

Great burgers and fries are okay. I have to try that animal style :) the bad thing about this place is there's not that much room to eat and you'll be waiting on your car to the outside for a bit..it gets packed afternoon.

Not much on the menu but their chicken is good, better than Chick-Fil-A. I got the box combo 4 Chicken Fingers, Fries, Coleslaw, 1 Cane's Sauce, Texas Toast, Regular Drink. I thought they had more sauces but they don't, it's only 1 and it's nasty. It taste like ketchup, black pepper, and mayonnaise all together. Yuk! lol I notice the outside kind of looks like Culver's..

I just came from L.A. at 3 pm and met up with some other friends from Cali I met when living here in Phoenix a years back. The boxing fight was on last night so we went here to eat some wings and watch the game. The place is new and it looks nice inside they female I think her name was Emily some cute blonde was very nice. We were like 15 in that table and took care of us even though we made it difficult her to charge what beers to who since we kept on changing places to sit lol. I will come back again for the great service and the water she brought me lol I was driving :)
