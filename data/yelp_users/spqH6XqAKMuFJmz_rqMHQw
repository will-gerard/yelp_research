Excellent food & service. I had chicken tacos and my husband had chicken fajitas! We left with smiles on our faces and full bellies. I highly recommend this Old Town Scottsdale special.

One of the best dining experiences I have ever had. We came here with a large group and they took such good care of us. The red curry is out of this world!! Do yourself a favor and go! Moulay (the owner) will greet you and provide you with the best experience. Last night was our first time here. We WILL be back!

Edible, but not impressed. I was excited about it because of the reviews and was not satisfied. I may have just purchased the incorrect entree (salad) which was bland with not much flavor at all. Feel free to give it a try, but be sure to order something other than a salad.

Great place. Great atmosphere. Excellent food. Be sure to make reservations because it gets busy! Fox Reataurants, you've done it again. Way to go! The Henry is a must-dine in the Phoenix area.

Excellent. Delicious. Absolutely stunning food choices. As a lover of seafood (and a picky one at that), I have been anxious to try this place. My husband surprised me last night and took me here for our date night! We started off with a side of fries for our appetizer and then both ordered our entrees. My husband got the shrimp pasta and I got the scallops. What looked like a small portion size ended up filling us full! We had no room for dessert (and that rarely happens..haha). We both enjoyed our meals. The scallops were hands down the most perfectly-cooked I have ever tasted. They were on a creamy bed of polenta and garnished with mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, baked peas (strangely good and crunchy), and onions. Every flavor combined to make one of the most enjoyable meals I've had! LGO hospitality, you've done it again and for that, my husband and I are grateful. I highly recommend this place and any other LGO concept. You will not be disappointed.   P.s. Be sure to read the menu with prices before going. We did this so we knew that it was going to be a pricy meal. Yelpers, it is seafood...what else do you expect? Do not let the negative reviews on here of their food being expensive stop you from going. Save up a bit, go for a special occasion, anything, and enjoy yourselves!! We highly recommend treating yourself to this place.
