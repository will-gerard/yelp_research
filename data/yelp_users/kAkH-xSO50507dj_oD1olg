People will likely keep coming here because of the location but that doesn't mean you have to.  I think we would all agree this is consistently the worst service ever experienced at any type business. Im surprised that people are shocked. It's clearly a corporate culture to try to be arrogant and pushy toward the customers.  They are acting like this on purpose. It would be too much of a coincidence that they hired the 20 biggest jerks in AZ. They have trained these people to make your life horrible.  The waiting area is high comedy as everyone is milling around commenting on how much they hate Cobblestone. Obviously just go any place else and you'll have a better experience. It would be impossible for it to be worse.  I bet their complaint department is just one giant paper shredder.

This is one of my favorite places in AZ.  First of all, the "buzz" is one of the best inventions of the 21st century.  It's delicious.  Both breakfast burritos are phenomenal, but my two favorite items are the oatmeal and the turkey club.  They are superb.  I ashamed to have written this much without mentioning the guys that run the place.  They are hilarious and always in a good mood.

I've tried about 5 different barbers since i moved to AZ from Boston.  This is the only place that I've been to more than once.  I've been about 8 times.  They have been incredibly consistent in listening to what I wanted.  Also, they do free neck shaving if you are in between cuts.

And the Herb Box does it again... I knew not to go back after the terrible service, but my girlfriend said she really wanted to try it.  So what happens? I check my bank statement and they charged me twice!  Once for my meal and an additional charge for 137 bucks!  I'll change this review if they handle it well, but I'm not holding my breath.

The 5 stars here are basically just for the bartender, Mike.  He's a magician.  He made some phenomenal drinks that we'd never tasted before.  He also threw in a few samples when we weren't sure what we wanted.  The food was great as well. The chicken tacos were excellent as well as the grilled corn.  This place is a no brainer. You have to go here.  The cougars were out in full force, but it's definitely a place for the late 20's crowd as well.

This place makes me appreciate Jimmy Johns.  This place makes you feel like cattle being herded to the trough.  It's a Miracle they are still in business. You can get better sandwiches at Whole Foods or Jimmy Johns for a lower price!

The other reviews of the Optima that don't give it 5 stars BLOW my mind.  This is the nicest complex I've ever seen.  Indoor basketball court, one in door pool, 2 outdoor pools, dry cleaner on site, garage parking, 3 different restaurants, and a great concierge... and we haven't even touched on the actual apartments!  Hardwood floors, stainless steel appliances, and granite countertops are standards.  The people that live here also make the Optima even better.  A smattering a young professionals, professional athletes (NBA, NFL, MLB) and nice families make it a great place to live.

This is the best breakfast place around. Period. They are consistent, fast, delicious and very friendly. They also are great caterers.  I would bet there is no friendlier staff in AZ.

The first time I went we had a big group and plenty of conversation so we didn't really mind the slow service.  The flat breads were all great as were the tacos.  The pulled pork sliders were a little weak, but the food was very good overall.  The second time the horrible service reared its ugly head.  My girlfriend and I sat down and just under 20 minutes went by and no waiter came to see us.  The one guy I saw was absurdly overworked.  The poor kid seemed to have 10 tables and was bussing his own tables as well.  When we left the manager seemed genuinely apologetic and tried to offer us an appetizer.  I just can't give my business to a place like this when there are plenty of restaurants in the city that are hustling to earn our business.  I like the food, but the atrociously slow service is too much to bear.

This family owned business is all you can ask of a dry cleaner. They are fast, consistent, have great hours and they will try to accommodate special requests. Lovely people. Can't beat them.

I almost hate when service is this good because they've basically earned my business for years. The suits are excellent. I was pleasantly surprised. Definitely best place in the valley for a suit. Tons of great options. Shirts are a 4.5 out of 5. If you're a fat dude these won't work. They haven't started their bespoke suits and shirts yet but I'm looking forward to those. The ties and shoes are good but not their bread and butter. There was a tall blonde dude who was very knowledgable, personable and friendly. I've been desperately looking for a place to get suits since moving from the east coast and I've found it. I gave this place no shot to live up to the hype but it did.  If you're a guy who wants a good price for high quality slim fitting shirts and suits save yourself the aggravation and just go here. It's hidden up the escalator by Tanzy. Basically above Lululemon.

This place is top notch. The sushi was excellent as was the service. Great upscale atmosphere and bar. This place isn't just for golfers. It's worth a night out.
