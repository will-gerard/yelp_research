Less than 15 minutes to change a car battery on a weekend day without an appointment?  Awesome!!  After getting a jump start at the airport (my car decided to seek revenge on not going on vacation with me by killing the battery in my absence), I rummaged through my glove compartment to figure out where I had purchased my last car battery.  Turns out it was a couple of years ago at another Checker establishment.  This Indian School location is the closest to my house so I drove straight there, pulled up and was literally on the road again within minutes.  Checker has great warranties on their batteries - 24 months guarantee for a free replacement and big discounts thereafter.  I only ended up paying $40 for my new one.  My only complaint is that it's difficult to see this Checker from the road.  It's in the back of the shopping center near the Food City.  At least that means plenty of parking when you roll your autos in for new parts. :)

This review is specifically for the Alvadora Spa...and even more so for Mariah who gave me the most incredible facial I have ever had in my entire life. Ladies and gents - if I were you I would definitely take advantage of the $99 summer promotion and treat yourself to a truly rejuvenating experience. I've had a number of facials in my life but I've never had an aesthetician actually stay in the room while the masks were drying and give upper back, cranial, arm and hand massages nor have I ever had luxuriously warm rehydrating hand mitts during the process of a facial. My skin has a new, refreshed glow to boot. This is the pinnacle of facials - I will never go anywhere else!

YUCK! Should have read the reviews before I darted in for a quick wax. The towel on top of the waxing chair was covered in old, dry wax...I got the creeps and asked for paper towels to lie on it was so bad. The wax itself was awful. I left with yellow wax stuck all over my face, I had to use tweezers when I got home and now I have a weird rash. What a waste of time, money and hair! Please go elsewhere.

Anytime I can't hitch a ride to the airport I always park at PreFlight.  Why?  Because it takes much less time than parking at the airport itself, it's cheaper (check out the coupons on the website!) and they have a Frequent Parker Program so I earn a free day for every five days parked.  Now, I always liked PreFlight but last week I decided that I love them because after returning from an awesome weekend in Vegas I hopped on the PreFlight shuttle bus (which comes every few minutes) and arrived at the lot to find a sad car with a dead battery.  It was hot and I was in no mood to play games with my car.  I tried and tried but I couldn't get her to come to life.  Within seconds a PreFlight staffer drove up out of nowhere in a golfcart with a portable jumper cable box and revived my car so I could get a move on.  Talk about service!  Had I parked at the airport I'm not sure how long I would have been stranded!

The other night my girlfriends and I were starving after a book and author event that we attended at Dobson High School.  Craving Indian food, we stopped into Copper Kettle which is located in the closest shopping center to the school.  It's not often that I feel invisible, but the poor service we received here made me feel that way.  There were only two other occupied tables when we walked in, and the wait staff made me feel like I was intruding on something important.  They were all standing around a table and I had to actually make eye contact to get the head nod directing us to our seats.  After asking for water three times, we finally got it WITH our entrees (not to mention that you can't order a Kingfisher to wash your meal down because they don't sell alcoholic beverages).  Yes, they ignored all of our requests for something to drink until they could bring it with our food.  The food was actually fine.  We ordered three vegetarian dishes - the lentils, vegetable curry and a cauliflower dish.  The spice level was right but the portions were pretty small.  And, they charge for rice.   That's one of my biggest pet peeves.  Has the price of basmati rice gone up so much that you have to make me feel silly for asking if it's included?  I love Indian/Pakistani food, but the poor service here was more memorable than my stomach's happiness so I don't think I'll be returning if I find myself in the area again.

Sticklers - I've been searching for you...and I'm so happy I found you! Since starting a job downtown nearly a year ago I've been looking high and low for a place where I can make my own salad and not get charged an arm and a leg for liking lots of veggies.  And, now, here you are!  I see a long and beautiful lunchtime life together.  With over 30 fresh toppings and mix-ins UNLIMITED for $6.50 you are definitely the healthiest and best value in (down)town.  I may not go right at 12:30 when the crowds take up all of your indoor seating, but I have no doubt that I'll be back very soon.

After years of worrying about our pup being stuck in a crate at the groomers, we finally decided to try a mobile groomer whose entire attention would be on our girl. Linda from Galloping Groomers was the perfect solution! She was extremely loving to our dog and groomed her exactly the way we like...the process really could not have been easier or more positive! I highly recommend this reliable company. We won't be going anywhere else for future grooming appointments!

Yum Yum Yum!  I went to Las Glorias for lunch today with a large group (there were 11 of us) and I always get nervous when dining with so many people.  It's inevitable that someone's order won't be right or service will be molasses-slow...but not here!  After we all ordered, I don't think more than 15 or 20 minutes went by for all of us to get our piping hot, fresh comida - and not one mistake was made - bonus!!  Everyone's dishes looked fantastic and judging by the fact that by the end of the meal not a piece of rice was left on the plate, I would say this place was a hit for everyone.  Let's get to the food!  While we were waiting for our entrees, we all devoured the tortilla and sweet potato (?) chips which were served with both warm bean salsa and a fresh, pico de gallo-like salsa.  Both salsas were perfect and did their job tiding us over until our meals arrived. I was definitely influenced by the fact that New Times rated Las Glorias' fish tacos the best of 2009 so it was a no-brainer for me (and at least 4 of my other dining companions).  The tacos were honestly perfect.  They were double wrapped in fresh corn tortillas (I hate when all of my taco toppings leak through the tortillas so I definitely appreciated the double dose) with perfectly grilled whitefish, crumbly Mexican cheese and shredded lettuce.  There were huge sides of arroz and beans with cheese on my plate which added to the wonderful flavor and filling portion.   And for only $7 this was a serious bargain.  The arroz con pollo, shrimp burros  and other entrees that were ordered around me received major kudos as well.  For dessert, we ordered the flan, churros and lip-smacking fried ice cream which were the perfect way to end the meal.  Who doesn't love a little dessert-tasting, right?  I will definitely be returning to Las Glorias on a Wednesday when they have their 99 cent fish tacos night (and if I recall correctly beers under $1.50).  Hello mid-week deal!

My husband and I had a delightful, romantic date at Backstreet recently...but because we happened to be there on the VERY LAST NIGHT that this fabulous establishment was open for business, I sadly won't go into much detail.  I loved this space - a hidden gem in every regard from it's location to its ambiance and fantastic and affordable wine selection.  As memorabilia from our great date and as a personal bon voyage, I look forward to opening the bottle we purchased from the accompanying shop at a later date.  Until then, if you were a fan of Backstreet Wine Salon, make sure to log on to their website and add your name to their email list so they can keep you updated on any future news.  I don't know about all of you but I'm sick and tired of these wonderful, independently owned places going out of business. :(

Our daughter has such fun with teacher Sarah on Saturday mornings! We have now completed two seasons of Music Together with our 13 month old and have really enjoyed this wonderful, enriching family experience. Children are never too young to begin appreciating music and this is the best place to start!

STAY AWAY. I didn't want to get any further into my review without declaring my warning up close and personal. From start to finish my recent experience with Paesano was atrocious. First, I called to ask if they had a website since I would be ordering a lot of food for a work event and the guy gave me a website that doesn't exist. When I told him it didn't work he raised his voice in a "are you stupid tone"? He repeated the spelling of the website which still didn't exist so I finally asked for him to fax a copy of the menu.  When I placed the order the next day I asked if they include paper plates and utensils to which he replied in the same "are you stupid tone" "uhhh why would we do that? People either eat in our restaurant or they take the food home where they have plates and forks there."  OK...  When I arrived to pick up the food at 4:00 like I said I would, no one was at the front counter.  An entire five minutes goes by and still no one.  So, I called the restaurant from INSIDE the restaurant until someone came out to acknowledge me. Turned out to be the same gruff guy from the phone who appeared to be the owner and manager.  Nothing was ready...not even the side salads. He disappeared and spent another 10 minutes preparing the food which came out to extremely small portions for the price.  I mean, each little ravioli cost around $2 a piece!  When he went to ring me up the final kicker ensued.  First, he charged me for 9 entrees when I ordered 7.  When I asked him to go over the itemized receipt he said "what, you don't trust me?"  Ummm...hello...NO turns out I shouldn't trust you at all since you overcharged me for 2 invisible meals!  Then, without apologizing for his mistake, he rang me up again and this time charged me $1000.06 for my 7 meals. You read that  correctly - one THOUSAND dollars.  When I looked at the credit card bill before signing I pointed out his error and he replied "No, it says 100 dollars."  To which I was blown away.  I practically had to shove the bill in his face for him to accept his mistake.  Finally, 20 minutes after I was supposed to have left I finally had my overly priced food and paid the correct amount.  The owner/manager could not have been ruder and I hope this review prevents you from facing his wrath in the future.

This is a review specifically for the bakery at this Fry's Food Store (I am not taking into consideration the fact that the worst drivers in the state of Arizona choose to shop here and endanger my life when I attempt to park - that's not Fry's fault!).  For my dad's 60th birthday party I initially wanted to order one of those fancy, I-can't-believe-someone-has-the-creativity-and-patience-to-make-something-like-that kind of cakes from one of the independent bakeries in the area.  But, after receiving estimates ranging from $90-$175 for a cake that would serve our 50 guests I just couldn't go through with it.  Instead, I chose to call the bakery at this Fry's and ordered a hilarious/delicious 1/2 sheet Picture-A-Cake featuring an edible screen printed photo of my dad on his Bar Mitzvah day.  The cake itself was an mmm mmm good red velvet with cream cheese frosting and only cost $34.99!  Our guests couldn't believe the cake was baked at a grocery store.  The only reason I'm not giving Fry's five stars is due to the ease of ordering.  They do not have the ability to receive photos as attachments via email - you have to bring in a hard copy of the picture that you want screened on.  The ultimate outcome is definitely worth the extra trip, though!

Smelly Dog is, by far, the best value in doggie day care in the valley. Our pup goes to "camp" two days a week at Smelly Dog and she literally drools with joy as soon as we pull up and she realizes where we are.  The staff at Smelly Dog are incredibly friendly and they don't mind throwing the tennis ball to our retriever for hours and hours because they know it makes her happy. The large amount of play space (both indoor and outdoor) was very important to us when looking for daycare establishments, as was a cooling system in place for the hot summers.  Smelly Dog has both! There's no extra charge for them to feed your pup a mid-day meal if you bring their food in a bag, and the best part is seeing my little girl pass out from exhaustion at the end of the day from all of the fun that she had.  Thanks Smelly Dog for taking such good care of our pup every week!

After having countless yummy lunches at SWITCH I decided to host my dad's surprise 60th birthday brunch here a few months ago and I am SO glad that I did!  A huge thanks to Jason and his staff for helping to make our party such a success.  The ambiance, food and service were absolutely wonderful - each of our 50 guests loved SWITCH (so much so that one of my dad's colleagues already booked the space for a private event, having never been there prior to our party)!  The coordination for our event was so easy and seamless leading up to the day itself, too.  Jason helped me put together a menu that allowed our guests to pick from among 5 options (one of which is not on the regular menu but was easily added because it's my dad's fave breakfast food) and all you can drink bloody marys, mimosas, coffees, juices and soft drinks.     Our menu consisted of: Croissant Sandwich with egg, bacon, smoked Gouda and Aioli Egg Burrito with jack cheese and potatoes Mornay covered Crustless Quiche with smoked turkey, green onions, spinach, and mushrooms. Candied Pecan Pancake Stack Sourdough French Toast Stickies with bacon or sausage  The portions were huge and all of the dishes received rave reviews!!  Jason also printed personalized menus for all of our guests which were featured at each place setting.  The staff were attentive and accommodating and the space is so beautiful that we really didn't need decorations.  If you are looking for the perfect venue for a private party, I recommend SWITCH 100%!

After dogsitting at our place for two friends' pups, we were definitely in need of carpet cleaning if you get my drift.  Last year we had mistakenly used one of those companies that mails coupons all the time claiming low prices and ended up having to bargain our way out of a ridiculously higher price once they arrived.  We weren't going that route again!  After speaking with Brett at Epic, I was very pleased with the estimate he gave which ended up being the price we paid - go figure!  They day of our service we were even more impressed with the heavy duty, top of the line equipment that Epic uses and the light citrus scent of the products was leaps and bounds better than the chemical/wet carpet smell so many other companies leave behind.  Our carpets dried quite quickly and all of the ugly stains were sucked away!  I would definitely recommend Epic for affordable, high quality carpet cleaning!

While many dogs are crate-trained and find their little cages comforting, my four-legged daughter thinks differently.  So, when it came time to find a place for her to board over Thanksgiving weekend I was surprised that my search came up with so few cage-free facilities in the Phoenix area.  I was very intrigued by what I had read about Villa La Paws so we made an appointment to see the facility and for our girl to have her trial observation time.  I appreciate the fact that they observe all potential "clients" ahead of time to make sure they are socialized.  After she passed her test, we signed her up for her Turkey Day slumber party weekend and were very pleased with the service she received. We had a very early flight out on Thanksgiving but the staff were flexible with our sunrise drop-off time.  Each dog has a designated bucket so you can bring your own food and treats with instructions and be confident that they will remain on their regular feeding schedule.  My husband and I loved the fact that we could log onto the webcams and see our girl playing and resting day and night.  The ample, clean indoor and outdoor space is really great and it was adorable seeing the dogs all snuggled up together at night via the webcams.  The daily report cards were super cute, too.  Be sure to ask about the requisite pick-up and drop-off times for boarding, though.  We were surprised to see a day care fee added to our last day based on the time we came to get her.

So maybe the name doesn't fit the face...but Local Breeze is a wonderful, independently owned, affordable establishment that is most deserving of having many a bridal shower thrown there.  In fact, I recently co-hosted a lovely bridal shower there myself!  The other bridesmaids and I knew that we wanted an adorable, shabby chic place to hold a Saturday lunchtime shower for 15 of our vegan bride's nearest and dearest.  After chatting with the manager, it seemed that this was going to be easy peasy.  He was completely flexible - we could either use the entire weekend brunch menu or he would type up a limited menu of selections for our guests.  There was no minimum charge either way which is a stellar bonus considering so many cute, bridal shower-y places in Phoenix require you to spend a certain amount.  Local Breeze also has several vegan dishes on the menu (phew!) but we decided not to limit the entire menu to veggie/vegan options.  The manager pre-printed personalized menus for our guests featuring 4  brunch entree options that were $10 or less (talk about a bridal shower on a budget)! We ended up choosing: Bananas Foster French Toast Fire Island Eggs Chopped Salad  Veggie Island   We also pre-ordered carafes of their white sangria so our ladies could get into the groove directly upon arrival.  The food was plentiful and received lots of props!  While our waitress seemed a little hungover from partying the night before, the outdoor setting was perfect for our shower and our bride was as happy as a vegan clam!

I don't think it's right that I should have an irritated feeling in my stomach every time I walk into my gym with premonitions that as I peer toward the stairclimbers I will undoubtedly see long lines and broken machines.  I have been a member of this LA Fitness since August 2008 and what I find truly incredible is that all four stairclimbers (yes there are only four regular stairclimbers) have NEVER all been working on the same day.  I guarantee you that there will be one if not two "out of order" signs on these machines on any day of the year.  When I've inquired about the timeline for a machine to be fixed, none of the staff are aware and it typically takes months for it to be repaired only for another one to break.  And, if you try to come any time between 5:00pm and 7:00pm, forget about a quick workout. You will wait and wait for a machine. This is a large gym and with only ONE water fountain in the main cardio area you should expect a line there, too.  I'm also disappointed that in this era of sustainability and green-friendliness you will not find a single recycling receptacle in the building.  LA Fitness probably throws away thousands of disposed water bottles each week.  That is just sad.   The only reason I didn't give this review one star is that I find the cheap membership cost and proximity to my house somewhat redeeming and I happen to like the smoothies at the cafe.  Otherwise, I miss my old gym.. a lot.

I wanted to update my initial review to let everyone know that things have gotten even WORSE at LA Fitness.  As mentioned previously, there are only 4 regular stairclimbers at this gym which are supposed to accommodate the thousands of unappreciated members.  Only TWO of these stairclimbers now work (one of which has been broken since the Spring).  Please see the photo above.  Instead of replacing equipment that continues to break month after month, LA Fitness will just slap an out of order sign on it and call it a day.  Suffice it to say that they have not purchased a single piece of new cardio equipment in years because it would actually cost money.  Speaking of investing in the facility, the carpets are so full of crusty sweat and mildew that the stench permeating from the building is starting to get nauseating.  The absence of towels and the lack of a proper amount of sanitizer and paper goods throughout the gym makes this situation worse by the day.  Anyone know if 24 Hour Fitness is having a membership promo these days?  I would RUN off the treadmills at LA Fitness now to find out.

I LOVE a good deal, so when I received a coupon in the mail for Top Design Nails, I was intrigued by the $26 mani/pedi which included a FREE eyebrow waxing to boot.  There are a lot of small nail salons near my house, but I haven't really found one that provided quality service worthy of a return...until yesterday.  As soon as I walked inside Top Design I noticed how much cleaner and organized it was than other establishments I had treated my footsies to, and I didn't have to wait at all to get my services started.  Honestly, all three of the services I received were firest rate.  Unlike other places that charge extra for salt scrub, this was included in the service, and my favorite part was the fact that they warm up the lotion before applying it to your feet and legs.  It was such a delightful experience!   Since I started grad school I've definitely neglected myself a bit so my eyebrows were in need of some taming.  Anna, the owner of the salon, made them look tip-top in a jiffy.  She also owns the alterations place next door which only charges 8 measly dollars to put the original hem back on designer jeans.  Such a bargain!  This morning I woke up and admired my nails, toes and eyebrows and was so happy that I've found "my" nail place.  Anna informed me that the $26 special will be running for a while so get yourself into Top Design for the best deal in town!

Efficient AND a bargain!  I'm a sucker for coupons so I finally called to make an appointment at European Wax Center (I was in dire need) since I had received my coupon for a FREE bikini wax in the mail a while back.  It turns out that all first time female clients can choose between a free bikini line, eyebrow or underarm wax (men can choose from a free eyebrow, nose or ear wax).  Yes - free free free!  I usually do more than a traditional bikini line so the receptionist informed me that I could get 50% off the price of a brazilian (which would be $17.50) or full (which would be $14). I had my appointment last night and was impressed by how professional and clean the waiting area was.  I waited less than a minute for DeAnna to come out to lead me to her room which was spotless.  She applied two different skin treatments first then used a high grade wax that does not necessitate cloth strips.  She definitely knew what she was doing to make it as painless as possible...and got me out in a jiffy all smooth and clean.  DeAnna also gave me a bunch of samples of the company's lotions and body washes which smell incredible!  I couldn't stop smelling my hands the rest of the night!  The prices at European Wax Center really can't be beat.  I've already made my next appointment with DeAnna and will definitely be asking some questions about the promo passes they sell to get even more discounts on future services.  Until then, because I filled out a little comment card I get to cash in on the $5 off coupon they handed me on the way out!

Bridesmaid dilemma solved!  I was recently a bridesmaid in a wedding where a familiar situation presented itself - LOVE my friend to pieces, do not love...not even a little bit...the dress that my beloved friend selected for me and the other bridesmaids to wear.  After a ridiculously high estimate at a different alterations place, I was in a bit of a time and monetary crunch to find someone to make all kinds of alterations on this dress quickly and with little investment since I knew I would never ever wear it again. I had driven by Kim Alterations countless times so I popped in and explained the situation.  Kim was as shocked as I was about the cinching, shortening, pulling, prodding and pleating (yes - pleating!) that needed to be done to this thing.  While we were conversing, Kim mentioned that she does a lot of alterations for David's Bridal so I had full confidence she would make this dress work (actually, I felt like I hit the bridesmaid dress alterations jackpot with this one!). Even though she was going on vacation the following week, she made all of the necessary changes quickly at a crazy affordable rate.  She should definitely be your go-to woman for bridesmaid dress alterations big and small!

I had to order a banner for a work-related function and after receiving quotes from several local places, the estimate I received from AZ Pro Signs was by far the lowest.  What was most remarkable, however, was that within hours of sending my final proof to Jason, the owner,  he had it printed and shipped via overnight service so it was in my hands LESS than 24 hours after I placed the order!  The banner looks great and is durable enough (it's weather proof!) that I'll definitely be able to use it again.  I had a few questions while I was designing our banner and Jason always responded very quickly in a friendly demeanor.  I would highly recommend his company for banners and signs big and small.

I love my dentist!  And, no, I'm not nuts!  As soon as you walk into Dr. Hogan's cute, sunny, clean office any apprehensions you may have about allowing someone to poke and prod in your mouth immediately wash away.  I've never had to wait more than 3 minutes to be called to the back for my appointment to begin and Dr. Hogan's dental hygenists are super gentle and efficient.  Dr. Hogan herself is lovely and so kind and professional.  She doesn't exude that preconceived "scary dentist" notion at all.  I really like going to a dentist's office that is small and offers personalized care without long lines and waits.  Kudos to her office manager for never giving me slack about my constantly changing schedule when I call, too!

I'm always very skeptical of restaurants that boast cuisine from all ends of the earth. Make up your minds people! Jacqueline's menu has chocolate chip pancakes, asian rice bowls, deli sandwiches, Mexican dishes and a crazy smattering of other options. Can one establishment really be that adept at all cusines? I think not.  I had a lunch date with a friend who was visiting so after picking her up at the Scottsdale Hilton I decided this was a close place to try.  My friend had the tuna wrap which was mayo city (she could only eat half of it) and after scowering the menu for healthy pescatarian/vegetarian options (I think only the Greek salad lacked chicken) I decided on the fish tacos.  I know ordering fish tacos at a restuarant that doesn't claim to be southwestern or Mexican was risky but nothing else really appealed to me! The tacos were ok...small bits of fish torn up inside flour tortillas with salsa, lettuce and "Mexican" rice on the side. The portion itself was huge so I definitely got my money's worth but the food was just "MEH"! I liked the fruity iced tea though. Maybe this place is better for breakfast? I don't think I'll return for a lunch or dinner meal...

This is the second year in a row that we've used Terry Williams' services for our tax preparation and I am so pleased!  For any of you who have procrastinated with your tax filing - give Terry a call pronto!  She typically takes one week or less to prepare your taxes no matter how complicated they may be and she is vey receptive to answering your questions big and small.  If you're like me and are not astute in the financial department, it's nice to have someone who responds to you quickly and intelligently.  I also appreciate Terry's affordable cost.  I don't think it should cost an arm and a leg to have someone prepare your taxes.  Terry typically charges between $150-$200 which is very competitive!

Meh. Went here for lunch with my colleagues after our annual department planning meeting.  Our server was far from welcoming, my boss had a long hair floating at the top of her beverage and my salad was mediocre.  One of my colleagues asked if she could have the gluten free crust option for a lunch pizza and the server unapologetically told her that it's only for the larger pizzas.  Really?  You can't accommodate a different crust for a smaller size?  Kudos to them for having vegetarian ingredients like tempeh, but I think that there are much better dining establishments on Mill.

This has become my go-to lunch spot.  The salad toppings are always fresh and varied, the falafel is great and the prices can't be beat for a healthy, quick meal.  The staff is super friendly, too!  They usually have samples of their yummy smoothies out on the counter for customers to try which is a nice touch while you're paying your bill.

My husband and I were really in the mood for pho last week during the big rainstorm we had in the valley but we didn't want to drive all the way to Da Vang even though it's our staple pho joint. We were the only people in Pho House when we arrived so we were served quickly (though the server did not come to the table once to ask how we were doing) but I was extremely disappointed that their vegetarian pho has absolutely no vegetables in it besides some floating onion and they do not carry tofu at all.  The luxurious, filling pho that I always enjoy at Da Vang was replaced by a bowl of broth and noodles.  In the future I will be driving the extra few miles to you Da Vang - I will not cheat on you again!

Dizzie is phenomenal! We hired him for our daughter's first birthday party and he kept everyone (parents, three year olds, babies) entertained for a solid 2.5 hours. He is truly a talented artist with a dynamic personality. Our friends and family were blown away by his creations. I would recommend him in a heartbeat!

We use a higher end dog food to feed our pup so we're used to driving up to Scottsdale to purchase it...so I was thrilled to discover that Pet Club opened a brand-spanking-new location near the Biltmore!  Not only is it clean and well-stocked inside but the prices for food, treats, etc. are FAR less expensive than competitors in the same caliber of pet stores.  I also want to commend the nice employee who carried my heavy, 35 pound bag of dog food out to my car for me.  Welcome to the neighborhood, Pet Club!

One of the best new restaurants I've been to in a while. A converted 1940s-ish Scottsdale home, this place has the Best ambiance--especially the outdoor patio. The brisket appetizer is amazing. I had the scallops for the entree and it was fantastic. Can't wait to return!

I took the hubs and dad here for Father's Day dinner and we truly loved our meal. I had the bloody mary mussels and I honestly could have poured the sauce into a cup to drink every last drop it was so good! Other highlights from our party's order included the BEAUTIFUL beet salad and the short ribs which my dad devoured.   The 5th star here goes to service. Our baby was a bit fussy and one of the servers (not ours) came up and said that she would be happy to walk our baby around and entertain her with the toys in the (fabulous!) gift shop while we enjoyed our meal. She said that when she was a young mom a server at a restaurant offered to do the same thing for her so she was paying it forward. So, yes, we basically received free babysitting at this lovely restaurant. Our server was very attentive too, and I want to give him a special shout out for accommodating our martini with blue cheese olive request - since they didn't have pre-made blue cheese olives he used a pastry bag to fill olives with blue cheese himself. My kind of guy!

I LOVE BellaBody! I've been taking barre classes with Debbi for over a year and truly love her teaching style, bright and cheery studio, and the diversity of her classes. There's no intimidation factor here - just a fabulous workout to be had. I also appreciated how Debbi made accommodations for me throughout my pregnancy. She knows her stuff! I've taken barre classes at several other studios in town and have to say that BellaBody is my fave!
