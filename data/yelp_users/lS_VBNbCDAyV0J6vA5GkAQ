You guys suck.   Your oil guy sold me the top-of-the-line thing without telling me there was another option and then that there was a $10 charge for a filter on top of it!   And when I went to check out the check I did clearly had no sense of customer service and just kind of shrugged her sellers and said sorry!!    So instead of going to the closest carwash to my house I'll be finding another one.  Unless of course you decide to respond to my review and do something about it!     Ken.    714.328.4475  And PS.  Since I got ripped off I didn't bother tipping your wash guysi'm sure they don't appreciate

I just had the weirdest experience at this place.  Heads up apparently they are not open on Mondays.  I walk up knock on the door because you know sometimes to restore locked doors... And the woman on the counter and dives to the ground to hide.  Then a dude comes to the door when I knock again and tells me they're closed.  No problem but weird I guess I'll take my watch repair work to the Santan mall!! Heads up don't dive for the ground when a customer knocks on the door.

Yo Cafe rio.  Your food is awesome. We are loyal.  But hey....30 minute line??   Not so cool.   Can you guys manage that a little better??  Like tortillas. They need to be ready....and that long with general disorganization the past two times we've been here....well that needs a little help!!    Ken
