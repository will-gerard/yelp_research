Went on Saturday for lunch, delicious, great service and we tried the stuffed chicken tortillas I think they are called and it was so delicious I kept eating from my sons dinner. I usually get the chopped salad from the sides menu and it is a really good sized salad with chicken and blue cheese.  It is $10.50 but can definitely be your meal and has just enough dressing to be light and you feel good after eating it, not over stuffed as it is easy to do here. The warm sourdough bread is awesome and I am not a bread fan whatsoever.  Our waitress was Brittney, an absolute beautiful young lady and she was very sweet. We love this place and have never had a bad thing to report. Just prepare to wait if you are in a vacation destination such as my hometown of San Diego or Hawaii. Very busy and popular.

Went for my husbands birthday today and as always it was amazing!!! Omg the combo fajitas were to die for..... The service from the hostess to our waiter Angel, to the manager of the restaurant was above and beyond. Kudos to Chevy's, you guys are awesome.

How can a single store consistently put out such horrible items. Now I will say that I do go late and usually only because everything else is closed but is that an excuse? You are open, you are open. Its has been several months since I last was traumatized with old, stale EVERYTHING but last night after a 5 hour trip up to Flagstaff and back, I was desperate at the thought of having to make something at home. It was last night 12:45 (close at 1:00) I ordered 2 Jr Chz Dlx (extra pickles and onions) and a small chili with onions. Well I got a cheeseburger with guess what? Pickles and onions- nothing else and oh yeah, a 2/3 full cup of room temperature chili. OMG why don't I learn????? I have had AWESOME Wendy's before- It can be done. Maybe if I went at lunch I would have better luck but but under no circumstances am I risking a lunch meal there. I am a night nurse so many times I go to these places because of my busy schedule so this is my excuse- What is yours Wendy's? PS....... Never again

Well we drove across town to try this place because of the good reviews. First of all I LOVE hole in the wall Mexican places and I have been to a lot. I am from Denver and pretty much grew up on Colorado Mexican. We spent six years in Southern Cali, and about two years in Arizona. The food is just very,different then Colorado and with that said I want to rate this place on the low end of the scale. If the chips and salsa would have been decent I probably would have left a bit happier. The chips were cold, thick and flavorless, the salsa was a very thin not so great as well. There were 5 adults in our party, everyone got something different. I was not impressed by any of it. I ordered a chimichanga at the recommendation of the server and it was not good at all.  I got it "enchalada" style for two more dollars and it had about a spoonful under it, not enchalada style at all and for $12.00 I was like seriously wishing we were anywhere else then there. The waitress was very friendly and brought me a side of sauce but the best thing about this place is you get a giant Coke with refills. My husband and daughter had a margarita and they were decent but for just under a hundred bucks I was pissed all the way home lol!, If your ever in Colorado hit the Santiago's, and see how we make our Mexican :)

I arrived here yesterday and didn't realize I had missing parts to my newly installed trailer hitch and I couldn't take the trailer because I had no lights. The guys at UHaul worked for over two hours making calls trying to find the parts for me and I will say that Joe was the nicest guy and really went out of his way for us. I cannot say enough about how thankful I am. I am in a very tight time crunch and this could have really been a disaster.  Thanks again!

Well this evening we were going to head down to the restaurant and get our complimentary dinner as promised by manager Chris on April 27th. If you read my previous review you have an idea of what the situation was last week. As I stated, the manager was very nice and he offered my family free dinner next time we came in. Well we decided to go tonight but I wanted to call Chris and give him a heads up that we were coming.  'GM' Rosario?... answered the phone and I asked for Chris. This Rosario told me that he was not on tonight. I told him who I was and let him know that we were planning to come down tonight. I explained the situation and this GM (how he got that position is way questionable) basically told me that 'we don't do that here'. Okay..... So did you want to call him and he can tell you what he offered to us, or do you just want to take care of us and you can deal with Chris tomorrow?... No,no,no and no..  Are you seriously joking right now?  I have the receipt, I have a review online discussing how great Chris took care of us and you really are not going to honor your managers promise???   Mr 'GM' then started telling me how he is going to discipline Chris tomorrow and blah,blah,blah....  STOP Mr horrible 'GM wannabe' Rosario. Do not talk to me about your disciplinary action you plan on handing you manager because that is not only incredibly unprofessional but it is not appropriate to discuss with your customers. What a joke, what a lousy sad excuse for a supposed GM. We had a few more words and he then said I could come down and talk to Chris tomorrow when he is on duty.So you want me to drive down there! And what? This is the night we are able to come, not tomorrow.  I advised that I will come down tomorrow and get a refund. According to Mr 'GM', they will do no such thing. Apparently they give out cards, not verbal promises.  Well Mr Worthless, thank you for nothing, I will let Chris know tomorrow and I most definitely forward this to someone higher up then you and someone that may actually care about customer service. REMEMBER- this comp was offered, not asked for.  Well my family is obviously not going to the buffet tonight, LOL,  We are heading to CheeseCake Factory, where the food is amazing and always 5 star.. 'Mr GM', you will be passed on to cooperate or whoever I find appropriate and they will be hearing from me, about you.

Ok so yesterday I received a call from 'Chris', the nice restaurant manager. So it seems like my review last week made to the higher ups and I assume they were not very happy. If that's the case then good. Customer service is so important and when I called last week I had a pretty bad experience with a different manager. It's was enough of a bad experience that made me Yelp and share my concerns. Well Chris was so incredibly nice on the phone yesterday and it did not surprise me because he is awesome in his job. Well after everything that happened last week I was pleased to hear from and he basically told me how sorry he was. No worries Chris- I appreciate the follow through and the personal call. I was informed that the company sent out some free dinners although it was not necessary, it was appreciated. Thank you for taking care of your customer. 4 stars for service. Thanks again!

Well I'm happy to say that our 'free' dinner was pretty darn good. I don't know her name but the lady manager with the long blondish hair remembered us and she was so nice. Happy to report a positive review. Thank you, I really appreciate the follow-up and we will definitely be back! :)

I have been dealing with budging vein, lower leg and ankle swelling issues for a few months before I realized that it was not resolving on its own. I am a nurse that works crazy long hours and I'm 41 years old so I thought I am too young for this right? Well I learned that is not the case.  I'm in good shape, not overweight, no medical history so what could be wrong right? Well I have greater saphenous vein reflux I guess you call it and anyone can get it being sedentary OR standing quite a bit. I am a floor nurse (14 years)  and I run a lot but this did not help nor hurt my situation. After two months of swelling, serious vein distinction and a very obvious swelling in my lower leg I decided to get some help. As soon as I googled my issue I came upon a website with Dr Oz. I LOVE Dr Oz so I payed attention, called the facility and the very next day I was in the office being seen by an amazing, sweet, and caring Nurse Practitioner who listened and made me feel like I was important. I set up my appointment with the ultrasound tech ( he is awesome) and in less then 10 days I had my procedure scheduled.  I chose general sedation for my own reasons and the day I arrived was so good, so professional and well organized that even as nurse, I was very impressed. The anesthesiologist was so so great that still, to this day I want to hug him!!!! I went into surgery talking and nervous, and woke up just amazed that it was done and I felt nothing. I went home that day, never had pain or discount (as promised) and less then 10 days later I feel 100% better. My swelling is nearly resolved, ( 2 years I have had swelling with an unknown reason, accounting it for my profession) I have no more 'tight' ankle feeling and I have one tiny puncture mark that looks like it will fade to nothing but a memory. I  am so pleased and after my follow-up everything looks great. I cannot recommend this center enough to anyone experiencing my symptoms. No more vein bulging, swelling or tightness in my leg/ankle. Thank you AZ Vascular Center, thank you Dr Oz for recognizing how great this treatment and facility is. I am very excited to recommend this facility, procedure and most importantly this staff of excellent people that figured out how to provide a service ( with customer service) that is simply very rare in this day and age.

Well this is the second year taking my son to Red Lobster for his birthday. Last year was awesome, amazing service and flat out incredible as our server bent over backwards to give us great service. This year it was just the three of us and quite honestly, after waiting 10 minutes to get water I was already irritated. No service, very busy yes but I had to get up and let the management know that we had been waiting for quite some time after being seated. They were busy and I get it but not cool in my opinion when you all want the all you can eat shrimp and you can't even get water lol!' We got no plates with our bread and used our napkins, had to ask for soda refill several times and only after complaining did we get some faster service.  Well they did sing happy birthday but no scoop of ice cream, no nothing. Kinda crap when last year they have us 3 deserts for 8 of us. Not looking for the freebies but c'mon guys, who doesn't give a birthday desert?!! Oh well, food was good and fresh and hot. Just not worth $75 for slow service without even getting a scoop of vanilla for the kid. Had to go to Bashes afterwards to get cake for pictures. Who has a birthday without desert?? Red Lobster, I will pass next time. You were nice enough but that 25cent scoop of birthday ice cream would have made all the difference. BTW- we tip good but won't be back anytime soon.

Ya know we have been eating RR for a long time and after today I think I will skip it for a LONG time. Service here is hit or miss, ( San Diego is always good ) and today was a definite miss. I ordered my food with guac on the side and pickles. Never got either because our waitress didn't come back til we were pretty much done. I did get my guac finally and it was too late lol! So the waitress said "oh my manager took off some for not getting your food right' ha ha we get the bill and he took off a $1.50 on a $10 burger. Why bother RR? I would have rather had nothing taken off because what a joke to do so little when my food sucked!!! The manager is ridiculous and I hope he reads this. Way to take care of your customers.

Not bad for Chinese buffet style lunch. The sushi selection was better then the Avondale location but the lunch price was also higher. Overall good lunch- green tea ice cream is so awesome!

Seriously disgusted right now guys. I have been eating here for about 2 years and never had a complaint. Right now I don't even know if I dare eat this crap. I'm mad and to sum it up your place is filthy, flys all over, salsa bar is crusty and looks like it has not been cleaned in forever, your trash can is covered in multiple layers of filth, and when I asked for some fresh cucumbers your staff came out and put in new cucumbers then grabbed the old slimy ones and dumped them on top. Oh my God you must be kidding. The place is pretty busy and I'm surprised I'm the only one who seems to even notice.  Disgusting! The store in Phoenix by my hospital is clean, well maintained and has decent sense of cleanliness and well prepared food without the complimentary flys to go.

if I could give no star I would. So after my last disgusting visit I tried again on Tuesday after work. I really do want this place to be good because I have had good food and service before. Well, what can I say? It definitely was cleaner but still not great.The trash can was cleaner but still stained with red goo down it. Good Lord, buy a decent trash already.  I went in for Taco Tuesday which is 99cent tacos. So I order, and my total comes to $5-something. So I ask the girl why its almost $6 for 4 tacos. She points to the sign and yes there are new signs with a price increase. Okay, no problem, whatever. I tell her that for almost $6 I would rather have the carne asada burrito. Nobody was doing anything at that point (cooks) and she just looked at me for a second and said ya. YA?? What is that all about? Whatever at this point. So I get my food and it is by far the worst tacos I have ever had there in over two years. Nothing in them and extra greasy crap dripping all over. Well I guess if there is not too much in them, you basically get a grease soaked shell. So disgusting. I am done with this place and maybe if they get their crap together I will go back. No big loss.

Really I was hoping this would be a good place to eat because Buckeye has a limited number of places to dine- WHAT a disappointment this turned out to be. My husband and son ate at a different location when we first moved to Az and they said it was not too good but we tried it tonight and let me tell you- I hated this place so bad I had to yelp to at least get started what is sure to be horrible reviews that are on the way. First, the place was full (just opened last night) so as you can imagine it took forever to get our food but the minute it came I wanted to laugh.  My pizza looked to like a Celeste frozen job that should run about a buck at your local Walmart- seriously not kidding. As far as the taste it was micowave-ish and the crust was like hard horrible cardboard. My husband also had a pizza, buffalo chicken and his was a little better but same crust and to compare buffalo chicken pizza, we had the new Papa John's last week and that was pretty darn good. My son had chicken tenders, total bar food and total blah. We tried a few different wing flavors ( 49 cent wing Thursdays) and they were okay but this place is on the Never-Go-To-Again in my book. Save your money and avoid cheap, overpriced crap. Our bill was just under $50.00 with a tip, 2 cokes, 1 water, not ever a beer. Buyers remorse..... Should have hit the Buckeye Chipotle, THATS always great :)

Had to try this place when we noticed it up in Surprise last week. Sunday and Monday closed so we had to come back!! Growing up on Colorado green chili verde has made it very hard to find anything close (Santiago's!!)  I ordered a green chili burrito 'smothered' but wanted beans and beef inside. Not really sure what I got but there was only beans and green chili inside. I did pay just over $10 so I got charged but didn't get what I ordered. Should have been $8.40 according to the menu. With that said, it was very good, lots of pork and a generous amount of chili on the outside. Cheese and lettuce made it great. Wish there was a hotter option but by far the best chili I have had anywhere all over Southern California and Arizona since I moved 8 years ago. Will definitely be back :)

WOW!!! Review pending. Go anywhere other then this 'Hospital' My husband and I decided that he needed to go to the ER to get assessed because he woke up in the morning with these large bumps on both of his legs just beneath his knees. His legs swollen, tender, and very red and hot to the touch. He began to develop raised bumps on his chest, back, and arms. It seemed to progress pretty quickly. My husband never complains about anything and absolutely avoids Dr's and would never dream of an ER visit unless he thought something was seriously wrong. I am a Registered Nurse and specialize in med/surg and after monitoring him throughout the day we decided to go down and be seen. I'm not positive but I thought it may be Erythema Nodosum, but I cannot diagnose of course, that would be up to the Dr.  He checked in and was triaged very quick and then brought back to one of the beds. A male nurse came inland asked what was going on and we explained his signs and symptoms and gave a detailed report over the last 24 hours. The nurse was not paying attention at all while we talking. He did not do anything other then a quick glance and then exited the room.  Next the Dr came in and paid even less attention then  the nurse. Now the Dr just stood for a minute and she did not assess my husband or even slightly exam the affected areas. Now my husband had flu like symptoms over the last few weeks and had generalized fatigue. The Dr did not ask for any history, did not do an exam, and turned and left the room without saying one thing to us or even give us an opinion as to what it could be. I never mention that I'm a nurse when I go to the Dr or clinc or wherever  as that could work against us.Wells a few minutes later the nurse came back in with discharge papers and an Rx for two antibiotics ( Keflex and Bactrim) as well as a oral prednisone.  No information, no exam, no review of history of other acute symptoms and he was handed his paperwork and said we could go. My husband was so mad because he was given no information and no medical advise at all. We asked the RN if we really were being released and the nurse said "what would you like us to do" Nice bedside manner you uncaring idiot.  We left, husband very upset and " we need your $125.00 co-pay" Even if it was something minor we should have at least been educated and given a rational for the antibiotics Now anyone in the medical field with direct patient care knows how important education is. Had we been just two people  with no medical back ground, we should have at least been informed on the importance of taking the antibiotics as prescribed, even when you are feeling better. Wow! Medication such as antibiotics have to be completed properly and many patients do not know this. So much for quality care and we will never use this "hospital" again.  Absolutely horrible service and care.  Hopes this helps even one person if they have a choice where to receive care.

Love it love it love it! Reclining leather seats; $5.00 early shows; self serve Coke products; you reserve your seats when you buy your tickets and you can cruise the mall until the movie starts. Doesn't get more comfortable!!
