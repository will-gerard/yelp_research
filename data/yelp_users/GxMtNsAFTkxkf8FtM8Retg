Honestly, this is one of the best bangs for your buck when it comes to quality sushi at a low price.  I say this because there are higher end places (which i reserve a 5 star rating for).  The lunch specials can't be beat in my opinion and the overall quality is great 9 times out of 10.  Highly recommend trying Sakana if you haven't already.  I go to the scottsdale location because its closer but the other locations do also have teppan tables!  The scallop nigiri, house smoked salmon nigiri, sweet shrimp (ama ebi) nigiri and mackerel are must orders in my opinion.  Don't forget they have fresh wasabi for a buck, totally worth it.

Myself and members of my family had been going to Scottsdale Hills for many years.  While I haven't quite experienced what i would consider poor patient care i have recently experienced poor service from staff.   My west highland white terrier was a patient at Scottsdale hills for a few years and during that time had some tests, xrays, etc. performed.  Recently when pet became ill i contacted Scottsdale hills to obtain any records that they had because i was seeing a couple specialists (cardiologists and internal medicine) who wanted to see all history dating back as far as possible.  Having had X-Rays and other tests completed at Scottsdale hills a few years ago i figured this would be a good place to start collecting data but they had none.  In fact they had no record of me what so ever and blamed this due to a newly updated system.    The service representative i spoke to initially could not find any records using my last name, pets name, or phone number as points of reference.  I then mentioned family members which share the same last name had been there within the last few months and had fairly consistent visits prior to that.  The service representative searched for every last name starting with the first two letters of my name with no results then asked if perhaps i had another last name?  Then asked if i had contacted the right establishment. After becoming rather frustrated i was told that someone would look into the matter at once and call me back.  A couple weeks (or more) later i receive another call from same service representative asking me to remind them if they ever found my pets records.  I said no, she searches again and no record of anyone with my last name.  At this point its too late anyway because i've already seen specialists so i politely say that its okay but mention that i will be reviewing them.  Around 10 minutes later i receive another call mentioning that they have managed to find info on one pet belonging to a family member but nothing on mine.  If you're looking to a long term vet i suggest looking past this establishment because their inability to store, archive or properly maintain medical information that you are paying them to accrue may be lost and you just might find yourself in my situation.  I understand the need for businesses to modernize technology but find it surprising that there was no method to search data stored in a previous system or that my request was not prioritized until i mentioned the word "review".

These guys are great! The current character limit on Yelp will not allow me to write a proper review so I will just keep it short. Goody's is a company providing a service to its customers that is rarely found today. They honestly have love for what they do and will do everything it takes to keep you happy even when other shops have caused problems. I have been impressed by them on more than one occasion and their ability to troubleshoot issues with Mercedes Benz vehicles is not surpassed by anyone in my opinion. On more than one occasion they have solved issues that other shops could not and their approach was to simply throw parts at the vehicle. Goody's approach is always to troubleshoot and order the part that's defective because they have the ability to detect problems that these special vehicles are faced with.  Simply put. None of my vehicles will be worked on by anyone else.

Used to like this place but very disappointed today.  They ran out of koobideh on a sunday (that's like McDonalds running out of Fries). After the server explained the situation she said same price for barg. Eventually we agreed (reluctantly). Then our server came back and said no, its going to cost extra and would rather us know than just give us a bill for more than expected (as if that's an option, surprise! $).  Our party of 6, some from out of town with strong cravings were about to head elsewhere.  We decide to speak to the manager who instantly confirms there will be no koobideh. My wife (who's Iranian) and i come frequently and expressed our disappointment.  My wife is fair skinned with light hair and doesn't always get recognized as Iranian. So... Her and the manager switch to farsi and not a moment after realizing shes Iranian we are told he can have koobideh ready in 10 minutes.    About 10 minutes later, not a minute more, we were served what we had been asking for all along. Interesting right? Now you can form your own opinion from reading this. I know for us, we will be thinking again before returning or referring others and will be make a point to tell our Iranian friends about this story.  I couldn't be more ashamed and embarrassed for them over this experience especially after patronizing the business for many years prior. Bottom line, the food isn't quite like it used to be and apparently there are some other deep rooted issues as well.   But hey, there's always Persian room.

You've found your garage door service, repair, installation, and upgrade experts.  As a business owner and a person who often outsources specific home improvement / maintenance i can say with 100% confidence that you will not find a better, more qualified nor dedicated company offering this set of services.   I wish I found these guys sooner because my first call to them was to fix another companies mess who most likely made a couple extra bucks off me by installing a small spring on a large door.  Very knowledgeable. extremely professional and courteous.  Did i mention speed of service?  I have used this company a total of three times now on three separate jobs and every single time the phone is answered on the first ring and the service tech arrives exactly as expected, often within the same day (sometimes within hours of calling).  Dan has provided impeccable service each visit and clearly is an expert at what he does.

This is a 5 Star real estate group and nothing less.  Absolute experts within every area they focus in, clients can expect to gain more than just a great home buying experience.  Joshua and the rest of The Hill Group pride themselves on educating the people they work with about the current home market and help you align your requirements with your budget to get you a home in a great area that you and your family will not only love but will benefit from financially in the years to come.  I had worked with another Realtor for almost 8 months which led to frustration and the decision to find a new Realtor. I purchased my first home from Joshua in the DC Ranch area and every aspect of the search and sale went smoothly.  At the time of my purchase prices were low which is obviously a good thing, however, the area i was looking in was a hotbed and at the time a bank owned home would get listed and have multiple offers within the first day or two.  Seriously, this Real Estate Ninja (Josh) was all over any new listing that he thought i'd like and would always make a prompt and aggressive offer that lead me to a successful purchase after around a month of searching.  The bottom line is this, I love these guys. I ended up with the right home in the right area that's gone up in value. I'm normally hesitant to refer others to a company but i have complete confidence in The Hill Group. I've referred a few friends and family members since my purchase and all have had the same experience i did. They made me look like a hero, which i like!

This place is quality,  I've been here twice and so far the only thing better than the service is the food.  The grilled meat is especially good.  When it comes to Mediterranean Cuisine I'm very picky. The chicken kabob is full flavored and juicy as is the kefta and tenderloin. I highly recommend trying the mixed grill and get tenderloin since the kefta is already a mixture of beef and lamb.  If you like meat on a stick you wont be disappointed.

Fantastic Food, Adult Beverages, Service and excellent value!      I normally like to wait until i've been somewhere a couple times before posting a review.  I feel like there are a lot of Yelpers out there who will just go somewhere, pick up on one bad thing and then bash a place or will have one good experience and go rave about a place.  That being said, I really enjoy The Clever Koi and i've been a few times now.    I eat a lot of traditional Asian (mostly Japanese) cuisine and i liked everything i ordered (which was a lot). The Chinese long beans with crispy duck tongue was bright in flavor with a subtle smoky finish.  We tried all of the steam buns and while i did enjoy them all i thought the lamb pastrami and pekin duck were the best. The smoked pig face kimchi dumplings pretty my blew my mind.  I wasn't such a huge fan of the smoked octopus but i generally prefer octopus in raw or ceviche form.  Oh and not to forget, these guys know how to make some serious adult beverages. I like old fashions, sazeracs, manhattans, etc. but ended up having a couple of their "Enablers" as well as the "Donny Wang Fizz".    This place certainly adds something to the area that was missing and i wouldn't be surprised to see another location open up soon because this place.  This is my new go to when a friend asks for a recommendation.
