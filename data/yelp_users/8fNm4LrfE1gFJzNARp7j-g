What a great body shop!  They did an excellent job faster than expected : ) Amazing customer service and they always kept in touch with me.  Oh and to top it all off, my truck was detailed when I got it back!  Would definitely recommend to all!

Sadly, this is the first bad review I have had to write.  Firstly, I have been going here for a couple of years and they have always done a pretty decent job.  So that is why I gave them 2 stars.  Otherwise they would have gotten only 1.  Here it goes...  I went in there with my new car.  The interior is a flat black leather.  They proceeded to lather (heavily) my interior with Armor All.  And I mean everywhere.  Anything that was leather, or not, they lathered.  Yes, lathered.  They even Armor All'd the screen for my navigation.  Cringe!  I mean come on...who does that?  Especially on a brand new car with a flat black leather interior...  So, that was that.  I showed it to the employee and he agreed that it was not supposed to happen and they should have used the leather lotion treatment as they always had done in the past.    He told me to bring the car back the next day and I would have to leave it with them for a "couple" of hours to get it all off, free of charge.  I bring my car back the next day and they call me about 4 hours later notifying me that they were all done.  When I went to pick up my car, there was ZERO CHANGE!!! What, what, what??  It looked as if they even put more on for some reason!  Are you kidding me?  A manager is called over and here is the basics of the conversation between the 3 of us:  Me: "Why is there still Armor All everywhere? You guys were supposed to get it all off.  What did you do for the past four hours?"  Employee: "We tried.  We are not able to get this 'stuff' off."  Me: "What, why?"  Employee: "Because it is oil based."  Manager: (seeming really confused) "No, its not oil based, because we don't use any oil based products.  However, he is right, we are unable to get this 'stuff' off."  Employee: "Yes, it is oil based, that is why we can't get it off!"  Me: "So what am I supposed to do?"  Manager: "I am not sure."  Me: "So I am just screwed??"  The manager had nothing left to say.  He kinda tried to stutter some words out but mainly just gave me a blank stare.  Didn't offer anything to try and make up for it...not even a free car wash.  LOL.  Later.   I took my car to the BMW dealership and payed them $200 and they had it off in 3 hours.   Now I can never go back to this place which really sucks because it was my favorite car wash.  Blasted.    Go here at your own risk. I did.

I have had such a rough time finding a reliable landscaping company.  Jeff and his crew completely changed my outlook on the Arizona landscaping scene!  He was at my house the very next day!! Super professional and a killer job!  Thanks Blooming Valley!
