I used to make jokes about how I'd someday like to open a yoga studio called Extreme Yoga (everything had its turn being marketed to us as "Extreme" for a while there in the early 90s didn't it?) There would be intense, muscle-building poses (this was before i'd heard of the genius of joe pilates), a drill-instructor-like leader barking orders for the next pose "I SAID RELAAAAX, MAGGOTS!!!, and criticizing you for being a weak little mealy-mouthed wuss if you couldn't get or keep your balance, etc. Good times.  Well, someone practically stole my idea and opened Bikram Yoga studios all over the place!  Just kidding, but not really.  The process of signing in as a first timer was so painlessly simply I thought sure I was skipping something, but nope.  Even as a Groupon customer, there was only a slight upsell mention of how purchasing an additional block of time during the first week would mean a better price than getting it afterwards.    The price of 'renting' a towel must be designed to be purposely prohibitive so that they can avoid too much volume with their commercial towel cleaning service, because I don't think $2 is a very fair price at all for what you're getting (NOT getting, just borrowing), and they'd much rather have everyone bring their own towel.  Nice that it's available though.  The facility is clean and seems spacious from the lobby, but the limited square footage of the studio room itself filled up very quickly with bodies. A shower/restroom/not-lockers-but-cubby-holes room is decent, and apparently kept stocked with soap/shampoo by volunteer donations.  Two instructors on different days gave a similar, but varied class.  Each having a slightly different style, both being competent and thorough in their directions -- I just felt that I could do without hearing about chakras and such related subject matter (i know it's part of the territory, but i think the lack of focus on the spiritual side is why i like joe pilates so much)  The class itself it pretty butt-kicking.  The advice to sit, but at least stay in the room, is good for when you feel the need to rest.  A newbie surely will need to sit for some of the standing balancing poses.   I did, but in only two classes, I showed a marked improvement in that i only sat down twice the second class -- meaning a 3x improvement over the virgin visit!    MORE NEWBIE ADVICE: ~drink a lot of water beforehand, and do not eat too much greasy food - you will sweat it out and it will give an odor like french fries, believe me.  which brings us to: ~take a shower IMMEDIATELY prior to class, or as close as possible, because you will sweat about 2.3 buckets, and as the wonderful instructor mentioned, the skin is an organ of elimination and this sweating is about releasing toxins, and toxins are stinky  ~sniff your towel first, if you rent one - some of them, although clean, still have a lingering french fry odor permeating the cotton ( i wasn't the only one oozing grease, i guess)  ~prepare to be sore.  this is a real workout, not some tai chi, ol' lady smooth flow stretch yoga crap.  put effort into a program like this and you won't need weight training.  I absolutely got a lot out of just these two visits, and plan to detox more during the next 3 weeks. Considering the price of this place (outside of the groupon), I don't think the excessive charges for the towels or the BYOsoap is very appropriate.   That would have to be figured in when I decide if I want to continue with the membership after the initial period expires.  For now, I'll just keep stinking up my corner of the studio with french fry and chinese food sweat (beer, too!), and hope it doesn't disturb the folks on the neighboring mats all that much by harshing their mellow with fantasies of grease and carbs.  8^ ) I love being healthy.

Moto is more than a sushi joint, because I dig the place and I won't eat a scrap of the slimy stuff.    Moto is a very friendly, neighborhood place where it only takes a few visits before the staff calls you by name.   Avoid the end of the bar area if you don't want to hear a gamut of extremely non-PC jokes, comments, and other debauchery.  If you aren't comfortable with this, don't bother seeking out management, because the raunchiest dude in that corner is probably the owner!  Craft/MicroBrew style beers are always on tap and domestic junk is never! Regular tasting parties have been held in the past by Stone Brewing Company out of San Diego. As if you were ordering wine, ask for a menu with a description of the daily beer choices, which tells you it's name, brewer, predominant style or flavor, and even alchohol % content.  Watch out for those high % beers; it doesn't take much before you've over done your intentions!  Considering anything except sushi, the menu offers a wide assortment, from usual to unusual.  I can't judge the sushi, becaue I don't eat it, but it sure looks neat and it's fun to watch being made.  Take some time reading the menu, because 1.It's full of funny (in a rude style) humorous tidbits, and 2. you'll find original dishes like the Thai chicken quesadilla, buffalo burger, and a cool build-it-yer-self meal for your own ultimate original combination of carb, protein, sauce, and veggies.  Become a regular here, and as long as you're not a complete tool, you'll feel like one of the family.  If you are a complete tool, this is the kind of place that you might be shown a sign that says something like:  "We reserve the right to refuse service to assholes like you."   *Note, I never actually saw such a sign in the building, but if you read the funny bits in the menu and rules for AllYouCanEat sushi, you will see that this is the exact mood and tone with which the place is run.

Mutt-friendly microbrews - oh yea.  Hiking with Jaek recently one evening was culminated wonderfully with a tasty ale on their shaded patio.  Sure it was warm, but we were together - a boy and his dog and his beer.  Beautiful, man, beautiful.

For what it is, it's the top of the heap. Dive bar with spectacular craft beer selection. Several nights of free entertainment each week, including live bands and stand-up comedy shows, trivia, what else? I guess that's it, but those things are awesome.  Friendly staff, clean enough, and i won't pretend to not remember whether or not i already mentioned the spectacular beer selection, but seriously, it's a really special, extensive menu for beer connoisseurs. one of the best (in a small joint) in the valley.

I'm not biased because it was my wedding reception and I was half  responsible for picking it out (well, 40%, no, more like 23%), but this was seriously the best wedding cake I've ever had.  The cake itself was BEYOND 5 STARS - it was a multi teired beauty on a white wrought iron triple platform, simply smothered in fresh strawberries, blueberries, and rasberries.  So YUM.  The cake and frosting were an excellent consistency and perfectly not-too-sweet.  The only thing holding back the last star was an unfortunate situation during the select-your-cake appointment, where the previous appt ran long, and even though it was the customer's fault, not the cake-lady's, cake-lady didn't really do anything to try to speed them up, and her pained glances in our direction did not make us feel any better about sitting there listening to 3 humungous women ask to try each and every sample in the entire building.    Fleur De Lis seems very mom-and-pop-ish, but this I did not confirm.  They are affiliated with the Embassy (Fountain) Suites at Greenway as the one of the bakers from which you may choose your cake that is included with the wedding package, so we weren't sure what we'd be getting. But the cake was a big hit; I don't remember a single person not loving it, and we had to scramble to get the top put away for saving before everybody gobbled it all up.  I'll try to remember to add a pic because it was truly spectacular.

Pink Pepper has always been something I drove right past, but today it's convenient proximity to Jamba Juice (where I had a BOGO coupon) made me decide to try it out.  I thought the JJ would be a nice soothing dessert if my meal was nice and spicy.  I enjoyed the lunch boofay very much - enough so that I had no room for my smoothie, and that is saying something if you know my love of smoothies.  The boofay area seemed small as you view it through the glass strip mall window, but once inside, it blossomed into a wide variety of dishes which were plentiful and varied: multiple rices, noodles, and soups, and several dishes each of chicken, seafood, tofu, pork, veggies.  There was a cold salad bar with regular and asian style salad.    Labeling of dishes was okay but not perfect, and I almost got a helping of deep fried calamari in creamy sauce that I thought was chicken, thank Buddha I didn't!  (yeah, I thanked Buddha, hey, we are in a Thai place)  Service was really friendly, start to finish, from several staff.  They have an oddly placed bar that looked well stocked for a restaurant.  Clean, yes, very much so, but uber-outdated decor.  A couple of other reviews mentioned Miami Vice, but I'm more reminded of those late 80's Nagel paintings and sneaking in a few guilty episodes of California Dreamin' (cheesy Saved By the Bell after-effect) when I would have claimed I was already much too old to still be watching.  I'm calling this 3.75 Stars, but I'd easily give another star if there was some mango sticky rice available with the boofay for dessert, but I'll admit that's a lot to ask.  For a sweet bite to take some spice off the tongue, the bowl of 'fruit salad' (peach, pineapple, banana) and doughnut-hole-like, sugar-coated, fried dough balls would have to do.  Another thai restaurant I reviewed, Thouch of Thai ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/touch-of-thai-phoenix-2#hrid:XgMuRmuhpdQwbGXU9PMu5w ), seems to be North Phoenix's most popular Thai place, and it's allright, but Pink Pepper really takes the cake.  They are family owned and operated with only two locations, but they've been in Phoenix since 1983, and have earned a mass appeal since then.  This is from their website: " Peoples Choice - Best of Phoenix/ Best Ambience 1985  10 Years of the Best Thai Food - "Phoenix New Times" - `84, `86, `87, `89, `90, `91, `92, `93, `94, `95, `96.  Arizona's Best - Arizona Republic & Gazette - `91, `92, `93, `94, `95. "  I'm not sure what happened in the mid-90's there, but my guess is that Pink Pepper has just stayed the same, while the popularity of thai food in general -- and the sophistication of the Phoenician palate -- has grown up around them.  With a lot more choices, Pink Pepper is not quite the novelty it must have once been.    Lunch boofay six days a week though means I will be back, and I will also use it as a way to get finicky eaters I know to try something different (boofays are great for that).  I loves me a boofay.    Weekday lunch price $9.15 after tax (no drink)

To quote my previous review:  "I'm calling this 3.75 Stars, but I'd easily give another star if there was some mango sticky rice available with the boofay for dessert, but I'll admit that's a lot to ask. "  == Well, I didn't get my Mango Sticky Rice, but the Saturday boofay contained a few items not there during weekday lunch, including a wonderful Thai Custard Tart with Apple slices and a seasonally updated version of the fruit salad with tons of ripe mango, strawberry, and pineapple.  The hot line had a few extras as well.  There were more seafood dishes than during the week,  a unique thai 'salsa' with diced green/red peppers and avocado, and a new crispy tofu number I hadn't ever seen before.  I also got to experience the same level of friendly, attentive service I've grown to expect, but from a completely different set of staff.  Consistency like this points to a very well run establishment.  So since I promised I'd do it, 4.75 stars!

After a few parties left and we were the only ones in the place, we were just like the family from A Christmas Story christmas afternoon, although no one sang us a rousing chorus of "Deck The Harrs" like they got in the movie!   We got several dishes to share family style.  Menu items more than hold up the 5 stars I gave the lunch boofay.   Special thanks to the chef who rustled up khai yat sai, a thai omelet stuffed with minced chicken and veggies that wasn't on the menu, but a member of our party ordered in near-fluent thai, surprising both me and our server.  Spicy pasta with chicken, Red curry chicken, blushing Buddha (veggies in brown sauce), chicken fried rice, spring rolls, Steak & Chicken with spicy thai lemon garlic sauce, and the khai yat sai were all superb.    Thai custard and fresh Mango sticky rice just sent this meal over the top, but for the portions the price was not over the top.

Rubbery, nearly raw, white outside, pink inside chicken in two different buffet dishes.  I hope they looked at my plate to try to figure out why i simply got up and left, but in my opinion, if you are incompetent enough to put an entire serving tray of undercooked poultry out on a lukewarm steamtable, then anything I can try to explain about what was wrong, will likely fall on deaf ears anyway.

There's a huge banner out front proclaiming : " UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT THE OLD OWNERS ARE BACK" , but I didn't ask "for how long?", so can't say how that pertains to the less than stellar reviews showing up here.  I got solid 4 star food and service.  I definitely recommend choosing "Burnt Ends" as your meat! It is a mix of pork and beef brisket, but cut into hunks instead of shredded.  It's not burnt as the clever name implies, but the chunks give you plenty of crusty "BARK" full of smoky flavor.   My usual habit of mixing the sweet and hot sauces being offered worked out perfectly.  The amount of fat in the meat was absolutely appropriate, unlike other reviewers have said.  It's needed for flavor, tenderness, and juiciness, which my sammich had all three of.  If I went for BBQ and got 100% lean meat, I'd complain!!!!  On a bizarre note, their fries were the exact taste and consistency of McDonald's fries!  Maybe a good thing to some people, maybe even great to some, but if they're not going to be the thick homecut wedges I'd prefer, then I'd say they should aim more for Wendy's fries 8^ )  Service was great.  The decor was clean and full of stylized jazz musician paintings and sculptures.  My only gripe is that I hate menus with rules, and this one was interspersed with the classic "No Substitutions" for the lunch special, and a few others.  No biggie, i understand they need to try to control some costs, and i'll be back regardless.

A place that bills itself as a "5 star dive bar" and pretty much fits the description.  (I mean, you wouldn't expect them to label THEMSELVES as 4 stars)  They serve a variety of non-bar foods, like soft-corn tortilla sreet-style tacos.  There are a few good beers mixed in with the usual regulars.  They spice up the week with nightly trivia and weekly free comedy shows. Really nice people on staff, too.

falafel phoenix best falafel best phoenix best falafel phoenix best phoenix falafel phoenix falafel best phoenix best falafel  6 Star Falafel !    IT'S GREEN!  Seriously the best in the valley, perhaps anywhere.  AND IT'S GREEN!  It really does look like some hippies may have cooked up a batch of "Magic Falafel" in the back of their VW camper bus in the Shakedown Street parking lot of a Dead concert.  I'm sure it's more benign spices making these garbanzo flour patties the color of money, grass, and a soccer player's ass, but they are a mos def a HOMEMADE recipe.  I'm not saying all light brown falafel is from a box, but that's what most gyro places are doing.        8^ P`.',.`    ---pPbblltptllptbt I can do box all by myself.  Various kebobs, dolmas, greek and tabouli salads, pita sandwiches --  the menu is classic greek fast food deli style, which just like the strip mall pad they occupy, the menu is a bit smaller than it used to be.  They've changed ownership and also pared down the size of their store significantly since their heyday.   Yusef's was Best of Phoenix by New Times, or AZ Republic, or Get Out, etc, quite a bit circa 90, 92, 93, 95, 96, 2001 if I remember the signage.  Since then, things have gotten tough in the American economy for a niche market of Middle Eastern folks.  I sure hope they didn't suffer from former customers purposefully avoiding them after 2001 for any sort of discriminatory reasons -- what a shame that would be!  Perusing the aisles of the grocery while waiting for your food to be prepared is like being flashed to an indoor version of an exotic marketplace bazaar (like in the first Indiana Jones movie, or hey, like Shakedown Street) full of strange and enticing shapes and smells and textures, foreign languages, and lots of "What the heck is THIS!?".    Spice grinders!  Pomegranate juice! Curry powder! Turkish coffee pots!  Anchovie fillets! Fresh Olives! Tamarind extract! I'm ready for the PARTY!  Where's the Houkka?  THERE IT IS! Up on the wall, several to choose from actually.  My green falafel sandwich was freshly made, hot, and delicious. Still the best falafel in the Phoenix area (but sadly, it was found to be "Magic" only in it's tasty savory goodness).   Only $5.99 with a soda, or check with the owner on bartering your knit sweater-making skills.  Can anyone recommend a good Goo Ball vendor for dessert?

Lim's Chinese Boofay is a throwback china boofay.  If you want seafood and spring rolls and vegetables and no MSG, you'd better head elsewhere.  If you remember going to a china boofay in 1979, back when nobody knew or cared that Chinese people never eat this stuff, and you loved the kitschy decor and salty fried food, then Lim's is your place.  I'll bet that the recipes and decor are the same as they've been for the last 30 years.  You've got your requisite fried rice, lo mein, beef/broccoli, sesame chicken, sweet&sour pork, egg foo young, eggrolls, fried chicken, and maybe a couple of other items beyond that.  Everything was cooked not so bad as far as the consistency on the Crispy-Greasy Spectrum, but had so much msg that my mouth literally had a buzzing feel when I left.  Not a taste, a FEELING, left over from the monosodium glutamate infused cuisine.  Blech.  The Discard Pile was actually tiny for the sesame chicken, but instead of honey it was flavored with syrup--cheapass imitaion ''maple'' corn syrup.  Still, I must admit it was lean chunks of white meat chicken, and was my favorite if I had to pick a poison. S&S pork looked lean, with large chunks of nonfatty meat, but the insides were a little gristly, and each bite in had about 20% come back out onto the Discard Pile.  Seems like they tried to keep it lean, though.  In the entire boofay table, there was hardly any color from veggies.  All I found was some icebertg lettuce and coleslaw in the cold section, plus brocolli in the beef&broc, carrots and onions in the S&S, and some white cabbage and a few onion pieces in the lo mein.  That's about it.  Oh, the egg rolls had cabbage inside, too, and Are the old school thick skinned, bubbly deep fried and mushy, not the spring roll thin skinned crispy kind.  Lim's had some decent flavors and I created a small Discard Pile, so could be a 3Star boofay by getting rid of the msg, using honey instead of syrup on the chicken, and adding a bunch more veggies into the mix.  $6.25 lunch ($1.50 more for a soda) was not worth it, no matter how much volume you shove in.  Still buzzing from the weird msg high.  No sir, I don't like it.

The drive to the top is really fun, and the view is worth it.  I really enjoyed it here, but there's too much freakin broken glass on any of the trails down near the main shade/view structure that you should realy avoid it if you have your dogs with you and stick to the more wilderness areas.  30 other reviews = TLDR (i just learned that one, see how I'm applying) so I'd rather be brief and useful than wordy and redundant.  I did read Chuck R's review, and I have to say, I wish I knew more of the nooks and crannys that you do, but I can tell you that if you want to explore the Western reaches of the park, do so by starting in the center or east, and not to bother with approaching from the West side of the mountain range itself.  All you'll find out there is a bunch of paranoid, possesive property owners who didn't stop to think that if they chose to own a home on a ribbon of private land that surrounds public land and restricts the public from getting to their public land, then they'll have to endure a little bit of traffic from said public.  Here's a clue for any of those property owners, whether you're on South Mountain, Piestewa, wherever....the guy sneaking around is the one you call the cops on for being a suspicious trespasser, not the guy driving a family suv with 2 dogs in the back, who calls you from the street as he sees you in your driveway so he can ask directions on how to get to the park entrance so he doesn't have to bother you nice people in the residential neighborhood anymore driving around here.    ah, duh.

Barro's is the best pizza in the valley, and a local chain that made good!  This is a newer and cleaner Barro's than i've been used to going to, so points for that.  The fake brick walls kind of close in on you, so I advise not to ingest any hallucinogens prior to your coming in.

I'm no connoisseur based on living in a certain part of the country or anything like that, so I won't discuss regional styles or anything heady like that; I just know it's good when I taste it.  Pulled pork sammy  on egg bread kaiser roll was really good.  Not too fatty, but enough for some juice and flavor.  Portion size that looked nicely 'good enough' to my extra hungry eyes, but quickly swelled into 'more than enough' once I was well into it.  Sauce was good - sweet and tangy - but I wished it were a little more smoky, since in it's current form it seemed to conjur in my mind the thought that it tastes a little bit reminiscent of McD's prepack nugget bbq sauce.  I stilll liked-ed it.  I had to remind myself to put down the sandwich at about 2/3 finished with it, in order to eat some of my fries.  Putting down the large sized sammy was no small feat, since at this point in time my hand was basically the only thing holding it together!    I managed to put it down safely and get to the fries, which were thick cut and seasoned as if they were curly fries.  Okay, but not made here in the kitchen, that's for sure.  It was important to finish the fries first, so that the tasty juicy pulled pork and sauce was to be the last flavor in my mouth, the one that would linger.  If you're like me, you put a lot of thought, as you eat a meal, into which flavor you'd like your last bite to be.  It's way more personally important than considering what your breath will smell like later to others.  If a part of the meal was good enough, and I know I want that flavor to be the last bite, it's worth it for me to skip dessert!  Service was fast with not over the top, but subdued, friendliness.  Perfect tone for a solo late lunch diner.  I'm sure she would have bubbled right up for a family with kids.  All of today's daytime staff I encountered seemed to be experienced pros.  Before tip and extras, the sandwiches are around 8 bucks.  The fact that I'm still full (satisfied, not uncomfortable) 4 hours later means it was certainly worth it.    The freaky decor will have you in pig-kitsch night-terrors.  Look for the flying pig attached to the pounded tin ceiling tiles, that is painted to look like a Hindu deity ~ bizarre even in this place.

Used to be more of a novelty than it is. Get your funky fresh breads and cereals, cheap wine, fancy beer, imported cheese, gluten free, organic produce, etc, etc, etc. But what they have is what you get, and that's it.  Selection is limited, but what they have is usually pretty good price and awesome quality.  There is always a line, but if it get's too long, they are responsive and send help.   Being in the outskirts of Arrowhead mall's campus, traffic in the lot always sucks.  Depending on the time of day and day of week you go, it's either little old lady traffic jam, or milf central in this location of Trader Joe's.

Big chains are important to submit reviews for. Even though the biz would have you believe that it  means you'll get consistent product and service across their multitudinous locations, has this ever been the case?  Even Taco DingDong taco meat is spicier in Phoenix than it is in Detroit.  This Old Timer's Boofay is run sublimely compared to the metrocenter location. The service level and the quality of the food coming out of the kitchen is drastically in a different league.    Food is still pretty generic - lot's of starches and cheeses and such to fill you up.   There seems to be a bit more pride of execution here.  Yeah, I know, it's a chain buffet, practically a cafeteria.  No matter.  What many folks don't realize is the amount of food dishes in a place like this that are prepared in a traditional, homestyle way.  Things like homemade salad dressings, madaroni and cheese casseroles, etc.  They do it to save money.  Reult is fresh, homestyle food for you. So they made it in a batch to serve 30 families, so what.   Breakfast is the real deal here, and around $6 if you skip the overpriced drink. Huge selection of all the favorites, and they're busy enough that it stays fresh.  I can't wait to be old enough to get my seniour discount here.  Inside of this svelt, healthy body is trapped the wrinkly, grumpy soul of a 68 year old man.    You kids get the hell off my lawn.

A~ an experience with Biddulph Mazda, that's what kind.

Alta Vista Veterinary Hospital has been my goto vet for years, even after I moved out of the area and now have to drive a ways to get there.   They've got very reasonable and competitive prices, and the ABSOLUTE BEST HOURS of operation of any vet in the area. If you work regular weekday office hours, and need a weekday evening appointment, it can be impossible to find that anywhere, but Alta Vista has always been accommodating.   My experiences with Alta Vista began years ago when my best friend Gideon ( www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iVlC0mKQ0k ) came into my life. Alta Vista is a sponsored vet that you can choose for your free initial checkup when you adopt through the Humane Society.    I've also been back for instances of illness, emergency injury, and routine surgery (neuter -- not me, one of the dogs), and they've been friendly and helpful each time. I do not at this time recall the names of individual vets I've seen, but they all seem genuine and knowledgeable.  I've only had Science Diet suggested to me lightly and then dropped, and any vet visitor knows what a pimp all vets are for that crap food.  One of the vets was even supportive and knowledgeable when I was asking questions pertaining to transitioning to a raw diet (  http://www.rawmeatybones.com/  ).  The neuter surgery I visited for was also a freebie using one of the Maricopa County Big Fix Program vouchers ( http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/SpayNeuter/voucher.aspx ).  I love that they participate in these programs which help the pet community. The voucher gave the surgery fee free, but not all the meds/aftercare, and Alta Vista was not pushy at all when it came to my choosing what level of care, and therefore expense, I wished to incur beyond the free voucher's value.   Alta Vista is a full service hospital and boarding facility as well.  I've not used the boarding facility services.  They've undergone a renovation, or actually, moved to a newer larger facility since my initial experiences.  The new facility is spacious and clean, both front and back office.    **It is unfortunate that sometimes folks have experiences with their loved ones that end tragically, but it is not fair to blame the medical professionals who try to help, even if they end up failing, no matter if your loved one was furry or not.

Open letter to business owners everywhere:  Watch out!  Your dream is in jeopardy.    All that you'd hoped for, all that you've worked for, is reliant upon one key factor, over which you have only scant control -- you somehow need to get your hourly wage employees to either believe in your same mission, or at least be able to fake it for the paycheck.  How you do that is part of your undertaking as a small biz owner, but you simply must figure out a way to do it.  It just won't do to have a super original idea with great potential (such as the delightful SOUNDING Steakenburger idea) ruined by careless execution (such as the ironic twist of having the SHAVED RIBEYE STEAK portion of the conglomeration OVERCOOKED and OVERSEASONED, ie burnt and salty, while the GROUND CHUCK portion is barely even cooked to a state of RARE.  Shouldn't it have been the other way around -- well done ground meat and rare steak -- at least  for food-safety's sake?).  A wonderful thing like 'fresh-cut fries with sea-salt' looks good on paper (or the menu board).  However it's a menu item that's tough to execute well, and a soggy, greasy pile of limp tubers did not look so good on my plate, nor taste like much more than a soggy, greasy pile of limp tubers.  Business owner, I know you can't be everywhere at once, so aside from standing behind them watching at every moment, there must be a way to instill in employees some portion of the excitement you feel about sharing your idea with the world. If you can't inspire a little bit of this quality in them, they won't instill enough quality in your food, no matter how creatively and thoughtfully the menu/recipe was formed.  Sadly, many wonderful dreams have ended when the owner gets a rude wake-up call that their brainchild wasn't nurtured attentively enough.

Open letter to restaurant customers everywhere (especially Yelpers):  The inc.com article recently discussed in Yelp Talk makes good points about the serious impact that Yelp can have on a business, positive or negative. http://www.yelp.com/topic/tempe-new-article-on-yelp http://www.yelp.com/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.inc.com%2Fmagazine%2F20100201%2Fyouve-been-yelped.html  Despite any controversy the article also may have included, I realize the importance of being a responsible reviewer more after reading it, and hope I can share that feeling and understanding with you now.  Especially when it comes to independent, unique, one-of-a-kind places -- would you really want your favorite local flavor to disappear because a yelper or two didn't like a particular server's muffintop or tone of voice?  With that in mind, I must humbly take on a review Update that 's weighed heavily on my soul for some time.  Several months after my initial review of Steakenburger, I received a note from the owner, Tom.  He sent a personal message instead of a public comment, and did NOT at all make the mistake some proprietors do by responding in an angry or condescending tone to my critiques.  Instead I found the response to be brimming with *CLASS*.  I received a sincere and heartfelt letter apologizing for my experience and asking a chance for redemption.  If you read below, you can see that they took the review and steps to address its criticisms VERY SERIOUSLY.  I would like to invite all Yelpers to remember to give second chances and update their reviews often, even the bad ones, whenever appropriate to do so.   Sometimes things go wrong that are outside of the biz's control. Sometimes a rogue server is having a pissy day and takes it out on you. Sometimes they just make a mistake.  We all do.  And we always want another chance, don't we?  Ask us and we'll tell you we DESERVE it, too.     ----------------------------------------------------------------- "Ryan C- My name is Tom Philp, owner of SteakenBurger.  First, I am bummed about your bad experience.  With that said, I truly appreciate your candid feedback.  I cringe every time I re-read your experience (which is often), but I believe your review has made us a better restaurant.  While we are still hiring from the human race, and will make mistakes, I'd like to believe that we listen to our critics and respond with systemic adjustments to prevent future similar occurrences.  I have waited some time to respond to insure that I felt comfortable that we had improved our processes and consistency.    I'd like to invite you back for a do-over .... I've read all of your reviews and know that I could get skewered again if we fail you, but also feel that we would get a favorable review IF (and only IF) it is warranted.  At the risk of your wrath, I invite you back.   Thank you for your consideration of this invitation.  Tom & Judie Philp SteakenBurger" ---------------------------------------------------  The folks at Steakenburger are a class act, and I wish them great luck in their tough business endeavors.  Steakenburger earned their redemption, and they highly DESERVE it!   I went back for the food, becasue it is unique and fresh and tasty.   The Steakenburger was a delicious meat-pile, cooked to ideal doneness, and yet still juicy without feeling greasy.   The homecut fries seem to be double fried now, or something, becasue they had a crisp outside while retaining a potatoey mushiness inside -- perfectly cut thick with the skins on.  Homecut fries are hard to crisp up, and they've done a wonderful job with this recipe.    There are ten different flavors of wings (let's see if I can remember them: mild, med, hot, suicide, zombie (?!?), bbq, honey bbq, honey hot, habanero, damn i fell short!) and there is even a neat challenge to eat a certain number of habanero wings within an hour and get your picture on the wall of fame.   I'm sure Adam Richman has this one on his radar allready for a future MvF.  Steakenburger is way more deserving than some of the junk that's been on DDD, too (Chino Bandido, blech)  In summary: GO TO STEAKENBURGER !

All the food offered sucks balls (except the heaping mound of french fries for like $2 that the cook fries up quite well), and the owner guy is a TOOL, the kind of jerk that thinks it's okay to banter in a talking-shit/put-down kind of manner with a complete stranger as if they were a long time friend.  Fake friendly doesn't cut it in the service industry.

Many people don't know it, but even though Barro's is a chain you'll see in various locations, it's a LOCAL chain, family owned and operated.  They established here in Phoenix circa 1984 (i think it was) and have grown and expanded all over AZ quite successfully ever since.  The best pizza in town, even if service is a little inconsistent.

This is the exact same food from the exact same people who brought us the fine 7foot tall, tube sock and sneaker wearing, weiner squirting ketchup onto himself at Mr Gyros  http://www.yelp.com/biz/mr-gyros-glendale#hrid:vNtdB1l_gwBMZ4slKfrGBQ  They're both solid 3.5 stars, serving Chicago style dogs, falafel and gyros, italian beef, and other assorted fast food.   Mr Gyros gets 3 and so BurgerMania gets a 4, maybe for nostalgia at eating at this building in its previous incarnation as a Wendy's all through high school.  I've only had the gyros and fries, both really good, with HUGE portions. I trust DarenC though, who has tried it all, and liked it all but the burgers -- but with the Pastrami-Burger getting a special mention, I had to put it on my list for next time.   (Ironic, with the name, but these guys aren't really specializing in burgers, making the alternate name "GyroMania" suggested by the previous yelper a great idea)  Friendly owner or his son will chat you up if you like;  I found the matriarch of the family who served me at Mr Gyros a bit more reserved, but still cordial.  They also run the Mr Gyros II up in Anthem.  So nevermind the Bell Rd car-dealerships, Motel6, Waffle House, and other nearby neighbors (the lady with the short skirt doesn't really want to 'date' you) and pop into BurgerMania for a little of everything.

They do a 2-fer lunch deal and they don't charge extra for brown rice like some of the indie locations of SamSam's do.  Nice decor and service.

I forgot they built a bunch of FF places along Deer Valley Rd over the last several years, until my bro Daren C reminded me (shout out).  I've been making the rounds to various area Arby's using the shit out of the free BBQ Bacon Cheddar Roastburger (arbys.com/coupon and today's the last day!)  I thought I'd try out another store to avoid wearing out my welcome on Bell Rd., and I'm glad I did.  This is a clean, efficient operation.  The building's pretty new, with a large dining area full of a variety of walled areas and nooks and crannies, giving many of the tables a private feel. There's even a big atrium window, and a real, live 15' or so ficus tree growing indoors out of the floor in the dining area.  Great atmosphere for this kind of place.  The service was quick and friendly.  I could tell that the young guy at the counter thought the manager barking orders was being a dick, but he took it in stride, smiling and saying "yes, sir" the whole time.  "richard" the manager was only doing what it takes to keep a FF store running smoothly, though, and young guy will someday get a job selling cars or something, and look back thankfully on all 'richard' taught him about  upselling and add-ons, smiling and being friendly.   Bad on Arby's for getting rid of regular french fries, though, as they now only have curly or potato cakes (which are great, but i always appreciate variety). btw BBQ Bacon Cheddar Roastburger kicks butt.

Rolando's occupies a former Taco Bell carcass and has been here for ten years.   Why have I been missing this place?  I'm not afraid of dingy booths and a CASH ONLY sign! They may look like one of your typical indie mexican fast foods with the big white menu board with red and green letters, but they really served up some delicious food when I stopped in for some takeout this weekend. Two friendly dudes were running the show, and one of them was even wearing a chef's coat.  I thought it was silly at first, but not after tasting the cuisine they plated up in styrofoam showcase boxes. Shredded chicken tacos, even with a fried, hard shell, were not the least bit greasy, and even though they fell apart while eating them I was able to fork up every single bit of the remains without dodging any greasy or fatty bits (NO DISCARD PILE!).    The same applied to soft corn shell carne asada tacos, with fresh made guacamole and tomatoey-onioney-cilantroey pico de gallo.   I didn't have the beans, but even they didn't look greasy at all, and the rice was fluffy and light, if a bit on the bland side. The 'green' sauce was absolutely yummy, with enough spiciness but flavorful heat, not show-off heat. Rolando's having a guy in a chef's coat is no joke; this is mexican fast food at its finest and for cheap, too!  Spending less than $14 on two full combos meant plenty left over for some Stone IPA to wash it down.

First (and only) Half of Review:   I happened into this dive bar/grill recently since it's near my NoPho / Ghettro-Center 'hood.   Stackers gets points for having a few different beers on tap (Bass, I can't remember the rest) along with the regular boring finds. That's all I was there for at the time.   I did not eat, but they seemed to offer a lot in the way of typical bar food. Maybe they have super delicious food, maybe not. I'll never know.   There would have been a second half to this review. There would have been a follow-up where I found the place interesting enough to go back when I could sample the food, too, because I did find the place interesting enough to warrant that second visit. That's what I was planning to do as I sipped my beer.   But there isn't going to be a second half to this review.   It all came down to watching a skinny dude in a cap come in from out front -- obviously smoking cigarettes -- and proceed to gather ingredients and utensils and then actually make what looked like a big jug of tartar sauce, or something, and then prepping other items, WITHOUT WASHING HIS HANDS.!!  This is inexcusable.  Skinny cap dude was not the cook at the time, a young lady was at the grill, but he was doing prep work in the back.  The trouble seemed like only him, so I resist my temptation to hard-nose and give only 1 star, and give them 2 instead.  I had so completely planned to go back and try out what seemed like it was going to be some good bar & grill grub, but I just couldn't bring myself to do so. Maybe if I were to run out of other places to check out I'll try it again, but not if skinny cap dude is anywhere in my sight.   For me Stacker's has fallen before even getting a chance, like a barely played out game of Jenga ruined by a clumsy player.

What makes this americhino boofay different from all the rest? Nothing.  It's just got decent quality consistency in the food.    Most of the service is also of a decent quality.    The variety is quite good for the price.  With mongollian grill included, your choices are just as much as at the super buffets, but a few bucks less out of pocket.    They've got a great coupon where weekday lunch between 2-3pm is only $3.99 drink included!

Cheap chinese buffets are my favorite type of "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives" to seek out and enjoy; a little bit of risk can sometimes bring a great reward. Other times..., well, it's a gamble that either pays off or it doesn't -- hopefully you don't pay too dearly!   China Harvest is one of the good finds, but it takes a very specific taste (ie cheap) to fully enjoy a dining experience there. The restaurant is housed in a former Denny's restaurant building, in a Food City shopping center at 28th Ave and Cactus in North Phoenix, and with its sloping, tiled roof, really looks like an old chinese building. They added a bright green, almost chartreuse, interior paint-job and stuck compact fluorescent light bulbs in all of the booth's fixtures to spruce up the place and make it their own, creating quite a trailer-chic ambiance.   China Harvest has been in this location for a long time, and is almost always moderately busy. It seems to be a family-run operation, since the same workers are always there whether I go for a late dinner or an early weekday lunch (insert Labor Law joke here). In several years of coming here, I've never gotten personal with the staff, but they are always polite, recognize me as a regular customer, and are even occasionally cheerful, if reserved. Cleanliness is okay, but the place is OLD, so maintains a pretty dumpy facade.   If you can get past the decor, China Harvest does make some pretty good 'american-style' chinese food. All of the staples are there, such as S&S chicken, fried rice, noodles, egg rolls, etc. They also include some items that are not always found, but that I appreciate, such as spinach, bean sprouts, and other veggies. I am not a seafood fan, but they always have plenty of choices, from stuffed crab to shrimp to mussels, which my wife and daughter enjoy a lot. I've even seen folks 'sucking the heads' of a pile of crayfish. I usually stick with the several varieties of chicken dishes, such as spicy General Tso's, sweet honey-sesame, or teriyaki chicken, and the BBQ pork as well. There are plenty of generic dessert choices to choose from including soft serve ice cream, fruit, cakes, and there's always room for Jello.   My only concerns are that a lot of the dishes are cooked using a deep fryer, and sometimes the temperature or draining must not be quite right and the items are a little on the wrong side of the GREASY-CRISPY Spectrum. On those days, the food quality combined with the environment would only warrant about 2.5 stars. If this could be remedied to at least be consistent, or better yet if there were more dishes prepared by grilling, woking, or baking, I would enjoy the food even more.  Also, there are no toppings available for the ice cream, just a standard soft serve machine with VAN - SWIRL - CHOC and a choice of a dish or a cone. I get around this by adding some of the bananas with fake strawberry sauce from the salad area of the buffet, but some chocolate syrup and nuts would be even better.   A nice choice for lunch is to take advantage of paying by the pound to get it to go. You get to load up however much you like and pay for that much -- lunch to go for me is usually around $3-5, which can save over the All-You-Can-Eat price if you don't have a big appetite that day. I don't like this on days when I want a ton of food, though; then it's better to go to a one-price per box place.   China Harvest may only be a 3 star joint to most folks, but it is right up my alley as a low cost, decent quality, cheapo china 'booofay'.

I wanted to update the review since China Harvest has updated their decor!  If you've been there in the last few years, you've seen the weird shade of green that accented all of the white-ish walls.  If you're like me, you grew to like the odd green color for its strangely soothing quality; I can't help but be reminded of a 1940's mental institution.  Well that has all changed (KIND OF) since the walls have a fresh coat of off-white-wash, and the accent color has been changed to a lovely, putrid, baby shit yellow-brownish; I can't help but be reminded of the classy and stylish 1960's Harvest Gold kitchen appliances.  Technically, it is an improvement, although you have to question the judgement call on the color selection.  Perhaps for the person in charge of that choice, the mental institution green was just a little too appropo?!?  They also put up some very nice wide-slat wood blinds with a medium dark wood stain tint.  They do a great job at blocking out the harsh sun, or even harsher Food City parking lot that graces your window view.  Still cheap and still usually great, just not consistent.  Another recent improvement is steamed white rice in a rice cooker for you to scoop from instead of from a dish on the steamtable.  Keeps the rice nice and fluffy instead of it turning into crunchy toothbreakers.  Still my 4 star goto cheapo china boofay.

I moved very near this restaurant about a year and a half ago.  The first time we tried it, we loved it enough to keep going back several times.  The food was delicious and original -- not what you get at a typical generic americanized mexican restaurant.   The place has really gone down hill a lot in a short time. The latest time we went will also probably be the last time we go.  The food simply stank.  Everything came with a pile of hard purple cabbage, which unlike the typical but useful pile of lettuce&tomatoes, was nothing more than garnish.  (this cabbage can be seen in just about all of the photos others have posted)  Dishes that had been consistently good over several visits were suddenly changed, and not for the better.    My daughter's shrimp tostada thing was a portion size almost half of what it used to be, and if she's going to order something that costs more than what I order, It'd better be worth it, dammit!  I know Parrilla Suiza has long been considered agreat place, and not your typical mexican restaurant, but it just isn't the case anymore.    I am curious if any other former long-time customers are recently feeling the same?

Goldent Nugget has a name that mashed together the names of two of the raunchiest pornographic magazines in mass publication, so I really expected very little from them.  It was a surprising visit, though, with fresh food and a super low cost.   It is sad to see the other review judging this place against the other "super buffets" nearby.  It's truly an apples to orange popsicles comparison.   If you want to go to the giant place with crab legs and junk for $12.99, go ahead.  If you want the kind of buffet you got in 1981, this is the place to get it, for a 1981 style price, too.   Does this menu sound familiar? fried chicken, sweet&sour pork, egg foo young, pork fried rice, egg rolls, beef&broccoli, sweet&sour chicken, jello, pineapple, hot tea, get the idea?  The thing is, that even early sunday afternoon, this little old school hold-out was hopping with business when the other two giant buffets nearby were full of screaming kids and gluttons piling crab legs six inches high on their plates as if they don't know they're allowed to go back for more.  Golden Nugget staying so busy means a lot.  There are many regular customers coming back.  The food rotates quickly and stays fresh.    Sure, the prompt, no-frills service from the host/cashier/server/owner/? guy borders on downright surly.  However you do not bother setting foot in a place that looks like this if you need 5 star service.  The food was REALLY GOOD. There was a more authentic seeming dish made with chicken and spinach in a garlic sauce that was more super than anything in the super buffets multiple steam tables of repetitive dishes.   I just wish I would have gotten the number of the doctor that advertises making house calls, posted on the wall here at Golden Nugget.  Not really a good sign to see this sign....but hey, I have a few bucks I saved since I didn't go to the super buffet.  The people getting take out buffet reallly got their moeny's worth, too, since the lady dishing out the food REALLY piles in as much as she can fit.  [cash only]

Maybe in the early 80's this was the coolest shnitzel in the 'hood, but now it's just plain spaghetto.  Really not impressed at all.  Tiny portions.  Mediocre quality, at best.    Too much bread($) for not enough meat(meat).  This place is riding on its reputation, but where it got its rep, i'm not sure.  If you're a fan, then hey, more for you.    I'm not coming back unless someone makes me an offer i can't refuse.

SouperSalad : Sweet Tomatoes  =  Church's : KFC.  I like it better than SweetTom, even though the selection isn't really any larger, it just has more meat available, whether in their soups or at their rudimentary built-yer-own-taco bar.    Recommendation is still to go when and only if you have a coupon, otherwise it's simply not worth the price.    These guys get bonus point for offering "permanent" coupons for $5.50-ish price, and have that price all day Tuesday without a coupon.

If it's not divey enough to be a real dive then everything that WOULD BE charming about a dive just becomes nasty or stupid or annoying.  Combine that with all the worst traits of a 'nite-club' style bar and we find Metro Sportz Bar.  A place that has an appearance as decently presentable as this is simply not allowed to pull the crap of  "CASH ONLY" and then point you to their privately owned and highly fee'd ATM against the wall.   And trying to be that cheap-ass while selling mAcrobrews at mAcro prices!  Seemingly serious bouncer presence checking ID's and such, and yet when a tweaker walks in wearing pajamas and carrying a chihuahua, security dude's too lazy to get up from his stool and plate of fruit to do anything about it, but he did make sure to verbally complain about it to anyone in earshot, from the time puppyTweaker showed up until about 5 minutes after he was long gone.   I think I'll end up back in here eventually, and then I'll know if another server crew might bring more of the friendly neighborhood divey feel this place wishes it had. In the meantime I've got plenty of other places to play free chip-tourney poker.

Mi Comida is a new name for an old favorite. ~ Mi Cocina Mi Pais hasn't changed their staff or ownership, just their name. ~ I guess it was too hard for gringos to pronounce.  Well, ¿Qué te hace pensar que este güero no sabe la buena comida?  A brightly colored, spotlessly clean, and intricately decorated interior make you feel festive and also homey at the same time, as soon as you walk in from the strip mall, Taco Bell drive-thru-facing exterior.  A friendly greeting, a bit of menu consultation, and a basket of chips with a spicy but perfectly balanced salsa was soon in front of me.  My sandwich was piled high with thick, moist slabs of roasted, marinated pork that had the most savory flavor.  It came with a delightfully tangy dish of julienned red onions, pickled in vinegar, on the side.    I used up all of those yummy fuscia onion slivers on my sandwich de puerca; after a tiny sample, however, I left the pico-like salsa fresca alone -- too much heat for this nortero -- but it was a cornucopia of color and texture and flavors!  ¿Qué te hace pensar que este güero no sabe la buena comida?

Overhyped and I don't know why.  Unless maybe those kids whose parents used the "electronic babysitter" too much grew up and found a place to feel at home - substitute a beer for the bottle, plop in front of TV.  Selection of beers on tap had a couple of nice choices, but c'mon, if I'm going to have to pay $6.75 for a large so-called premium/import draft, I'd better be having a little more skin shaking in my face than I'd care to have from these "Santisi Girls".  I'm sure they're nice young ladies, but I don't see coming here for the benefit of their obligatory company or vacant personalities, even if I was a single horny young 21 yo dude.  Saw a few small groups having fun with darts and pool balls, and a few lost souls at the bar.  Mostly I saw a few of the staff working hard (a busser and a waitress) while the rest of the folks in SB tshirts milled around and chit chatted each other up.  There weren't many people when I was there kind of late on I can't remember if a Sunday or weeknight.  The lighting was quite bright, allowing me to see all that grime and slime that normally goes unnoticed in this type of place.  What you don't know CAN hurt you, but even so, ignorance is bliss, so I'm only eating in *dimly lit* sports bars from now on.   That lighting is there for a reason, and it's not just to cause you the lovely surprise of waking up hung over next to a sasquatch after a night of binge drinking with your community college "frat" buddies.   I need a call out from my man, Flavor-Flav, BOYEEEEEEEE!!, cuz this one's made the Don't Believe the Hype List.

Owned by the same parent company as Old Country, and much of the same food, but just not as good (or should I say not as mediocre?)  This location is close to my job and they give a 20% discount if i show my badge, so I end up here sometimes even though it's not so great.  The food's ready to grab and eat, so that works well for lunch hour.  The digs are showing their age and wear and tear, but most of the bussers seem to keep things tidied up (as they try to earn a tip from you, even though they don't even get you drinks anymore)  Pretty much everything here used to be better a few years ago.  The last several visits I've encountered things like wilted spinach one visit only to have my complaint remedied by NO spinach on the next couple visits.  That's what i get for being picky i guess!  Your lunch here will consist of such delicacies as cheese enchiladas, cheese pizza, macaroni & cheese, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, green beans, corn bread, spaghetti, chicken dumplings, soup, jello, and an iceberg/romaine lettuce mix, and a few other things.   'tsabout it. ...day in and day out, with an occaisional 'teriyaki' chicken & white rice or grade-school-cafeteria-grade 'meat' patty on dried bun, or something like that thrown in to keep you on your toes.  They used to offer both ice cream and yogurt in soft serve machines, but usually it's only one or neither.  Just like the main courses and sides, the dessert selection just isn't what it used to be.  The creme brulee and prime rib must be held back until the weekend when they charge that $2 more.

I don't know if this place change ownership, or if some of these yahoos have selected the wrong location for the review.   this is one of the best small and independent fast food chinese food restaurants in Phoenix.   I and my family and friends are regulars. it is ridiculous that some people believe that they are able to assess a place in a single visit just because it wasn't perfect. they are friendly, the food and vegetables are fresh and hot, and the prices are great. want-to-be food critics need to realize that no restaurant or magazine or television food critic evaluates a place good or bad in only one visit.  this is a five star place for the type of restaurant it is.. I encourage anyone who has only had one visit, especially if it was two or more years ago, to either revisit or I hope that the intelligence of the reader is able to discern the difference. I love new Asia kitchen

I enjoyed my lunch here very much. A nice portion for a nice price. Chips were thin and crisp; warm and just the right saltiness. Salsa was pretty good, but mix regular and hot sauce for the best roasty flavor.  I really enjoy service from more experienced servers.  They're super friendly and you never see extra facial holes or anything like that.   I love being called "Hon", too. 8^ )  Everything was clean and comfortable.  Might be my most boring review ever.

That crazy St. Francis ~ Dr Doolittle of the Catholic church.  I'm pretty much a-religious, but seeing the Blessing of the Animals and Adoptathon event posted, and knowing that the Franciscans are the mellow cool hippies they are, I felt like this would be a great day, and it was.  The grounds are beautiful, but I didn't set foot indoors.  Francis wouldn't have been indoors, either though!  He'd be out with all the dogs, cats, and even rats waiting to be adopted into loving homes.    Lots of rescue orgs, breed-specific or not, were there with some wonderful and gorgeous animals.  I'm glad to see so many actually went home with folks that day.  The best part was the sign above the area where they did the pet blessings, that was not even put up specifically for this event, but is simply a regular fixture on the front of an outdoor gazebo, which says: "All God's Creatures Are Great."

While not my favorite indian buffet, this one was pretty good.  There was a fairly large and varied selection. I found everything I had to be tasty, just seeming to be flavored towards the bland end of mild. I also found all of the dishes to have a higher level of oiliness than i would have liked. There was not as much 'char' flavor on the tandoori chicken as I am used to. The garlic naan was not only delicious, but it comes straight to your table hot and they just keep bringing it, as long as you're eating it, no need to run out or even ask for more. Service was prompt and courteous, but it was too busy while I was there for them to be able to display anything beyond simply keeping things up with the rush, which they did nicely. The tables were a little cramped even when some of them were still empty, but as soon as the placed filled up, it was ridiculous. There were an unfortunate few whose table was placed so near the buffet that they were in the way of the line that formed. That lined was so much worse than it should have been, however someone long ago made the unfortunate decision to place the buffet line in a U shape. This makes it hard for more than 2-3 people to dish out food at the same time, and everyone else waits outside of the U for their turn. I thought the L shape of another buffet I go to was inconvenient, but I'm going to love it next time i go compared to this U buffet. Many things to enjoy here, including the value.  It's under ten bucks, and there seems to always be a $1 off coupon available somewhere.

Would never have reviewed this place, except Gabi's review made it seem necessary for me to mention that .......   *** Trails is the WalMart of head shops. ***  Like Gabi's friend, I too, used to frequent and even work at one of these establishments. I have experienced situations that brought to light the owner's mentality when it comes to suffocating out any potential mom & pop competition, just like the Big Box Stores.   If you have a choice, you will be better off sticking with a more indie smoke shop instead of Trails.   Trails is the older flunky burnout kid who didn't graduate from high school yet; always bullying the younger, smaller kids while acting like a big baby himself.   And the poor employees get brainwashed into thinking that the few bucks per hour carrot they are getting dangled in front of them is so very worth being able to keep their freaky hairstyle and piercings while at work.   Interesting bit o' trivia:   Arizona is one of the more lenient states towards the sale of items with 'multiple uses' , where some of the uses may and some may not be legal. The main reason for this leniency is because Trail's owner's father was a state politician at one time and helped make sure the laws stayed favorable to his son's lucrative business!

The air is thick in this hotel.  I'm not talking about smoke. You walk in and the warm, rich wood everywhere make you feel comfortable right away, but there is a feeling in the air. It is a familiar feeling, even though you may have never been here before. It's the feeling of nostalgia.  It's the feeling of class. It's the feeling of old Vegas. ...and it's really my style of place.  The building has been here since before just about anything else in Vegas -- 1906, so the strange familiarity and comfort start a creative soul to fantasize of sordid misadventures held here in a past life, perhaps a roaring 20's soiree or a post-WWII survival celebration.  The rooms themselves, although remodeled with modern conveniences like LG LCD tv and iPod doc alarm clock, are still thick enough with that ether-substance of the psyche of more than a century of guests that one can forget about the present time and get swank with the ghosts in the room.  (Sadly, I never saw any real ghosts)  Crank open the lock on the windows and actually open them up to let the 'fresh' downtonwn air into your room!  Check out the hand-tiled bathroom and instantly transport yourself to your gramma's tourqoise powder room to draw yourself a bath from separate hot and cold cross-handled faucet turns.  As long as you're coming alone or as a couple, and not trying to share a room with 3-4+ people, the only real drawback I can see is that if you're a person of large mass or width, there may be a tight squeeze in that bathtub or even on the toilet, with your arm pressing up against the wall.  There was a bit of the Freemont Music coming in the room, but that doesn't go forever, and wasn't an issue at all.  A request for a room on the opposite side of the building helps a lot.  For a ton of class, nostalgia, convenience, and value, Golden Gate in downtown Vegas is going to be tough to beat, and I'm surely going back again.  Maybe someday if I'm ever a homeless ghost, this would be my ideal place to squat.  I could make sure no one else was disappointed by not seeing ghosts here!

shmoogled definitions of CULT on the Web:  + followers of an exclusive system of religious beliefs and practices   + fad: an interest followed with exaggerated zeal; "he always follows the latest fads"; "it was all the rage that season"   + followers of an unorthodox, extremist, or false religion or sect who often live outside of conventional society under the direction of a charismatic leader   + a religion or sect that is generally considered to be unorthodox, extremist, or false; "it was a satanic cult"   May I now introduce... the regular customers of Chino Bandido.  I am a HUGE fan of cheap-ass 'Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives' type of joints, too, but this place is so over-rated; I'm just sick of hearing about it.  Sure, there are some flavor combinations that you can get here that would be difficult to find elsewhere, but the slight novelty is not worth the trouble.  If the fairly average tasting food were good enough, I'd be able to overlook the location in a strip mall that has 'Future Home of North Phoenix's Crack Whore Day Labor Center' written all over it.  If the portions were large enough, I could overlook the ugly (and inconvenient to eat out of) pie-tin ToGo box that your food is served in, and the price that seems like a decent price only until you get your food.  If more of the barely cordial staff I encountered were like the minority smiley and friendly staff, I could over look the STUPID and arbitrary ordering system that one is expected to follow.  There wasn't really much help, as some described, and why should you need help ordering when you are just picking a meat-rice-format combination, anyway?!?!  Although there are a few dishes that are pretty tasty, there is nothing 'fusion' about the menu aside from the fact that you can have your Jamaican or Chinese entree rolled into a burrito or cooked into a quesadilla.   ~Big Whoop~ It's neither as much of a choice nor as satisfying as it seems like it should be.   All of these supposed choice combinations and yet no Brown Rice.  The redeeming factor earning my second star was the friendly youngster washing tables, chatting up customers as they finished eating and he whisked away their garbage, offering to bring them an extra cookie for the road.  I also felt yucky about the whole inconsiderate, non-'PC' atmosphere surrounding the bandito panda and the 'takee-outee' part of the name, and I'm not a very PC person, in general.  They may as well have put up posters of rair-road and raundry workers in pointee hats with rong pointee mustaches saying 'ah-so, you want extra starch in your Revi's?' to a grizzly old Gold Rush 49'er.  Oh, and just go and look for yourself at their Health Inspection reports.  YEESH

I don't care what my mom thinks, I LIKE the way this place smells.  Bookman's hosted a Dog Days of Summer event this past weekend, which was really a non-event, as far as I was able to see, but it was still Bookman's and they're super cool even when nothing special is going on.  Their raffle ticket announcements were unintelligible and I had to ask around to find out how to even get a ticket.  The free ice cream from Blue Bell was apparently packed up and taken away within less than the first hour of the event which went from 1-4pm.  There was also a loosely organized craft class in the back room for the kids, and a table set up near the media area that had pet-oriented books pulled aside into a convenient grouping.   I only found one worth having this time, a book about hiking and camping with your dog.  A maze of shelves full of musty treasures and excercise equipment for your imagination is sure to provide some pleasure for everyone, as it kept me and my K9 companion Jaek occupied for well over an hour.  i'd never known I could bring my mutt inside, and the staff were all friendly and accomodating, but bookman's being dog friendly was apparently news to some of the other patrons, as well, since they looked a little shocked by us and the handful of other pet/owner couples present.   Open note to other pet owners, if your canine friend has some dog-aggression issues, putting a harness and a "Don't Pet Me I'm Working" patch on it will not trick anyone into thinking your buddy's a Trained Therapy/Assistance Dog.  No problem with you trying to take your dog places, but just saying work on its social skills a little first.  I knew I was a fan of Bookman's, but recently perusing their website has reminded me just what an awesome local, socially responsible company Bookman's is.  They are a model of the whole Reduce and Reuse before Recycling philosophy, and they walk the talk, too, it's not a marketing ploy like some companies try.  Bookman's kicks butt.  Even if my Mom thinks it's stinky.

Despite it being a common topic of discussion on yelp, reviewing a fast food chain is quite useful. Sure the food and prices will be pretty much the same at all locations, but the employees, service, the environment, and other quality issues will vary greatly. The staff at this whataburger are very nice and competent. My only criticism is that sometimes my chocolate malt is not mixed all the way and I get my first strawfull of nothing but chocolate malt sauce. However, this is a hand mixed shake which is a rare luxury in fast food nowadays, and I am receiving 32 ounces of chocolate malt for around 3 dollars and 50   cents. That's about twice as much as you get for the same price anywhere else. Can't beat that. Plus, if you only get a beverage or fries and there is a line in the drive thru, you'll often get to pull up into Lane B, which is shaded and you won't have to wait for the suv full of screaming teenagers or the van with 5 blue collar dudes ordering $14 dollars worth of food EACH. They'll bring it it to you, collect your money, and on your way you go.

Iain, Keri, anyone else questioning the name change... PLEASE READ AND THEN RE-READ CHER T.'s REVIEW.  It's sincere and heartfelt, and explains about the importance of the name change in a first-hand way that most of us could never know.  Piestewa's a pretty cool hiking area, but not really any different than any of the other metro area mountain park systems.  Unless you are specifically looking for the previously mentioned "stairmaster effect" the best bet is to avoid the summit trail alltogether and either use the Circumfrence Trail, which goes around the entire base of the mountain, or head to the north end of the parking area and begin at that trailhead.  If you want to take your pooch [the kind on a leash, not under your bellybutton] then forget about the Summit trail because no dogs allowed on the summit trail (only).   There is still some rock scrambling on these trails, and they don't have the same, well-established cement steps that they do on Summit trail.  There are a few choices of looping trails from here [check the map board posted] which will take you up and over one or more of the slightly smaller peaks, and on the other side you are in a large expanse of desert wilderness that seems truly hidden away from the city sights and sounds.  You can't even hear the nearby 51 Fwy; the occaisional plane or chopper overhead is all the civilization you are aware of if there aren't other people around.  And there are always less people out here than on the stupid Summit trail.  You'll see more dogs, horses and bikes out here, though, so mind your right of ways [another thing posted on the sign at the trailhead -- sense a pattern?]  If you are prepared with the right stamina and supplies, you can even journey the main trail north from here right into the 32 Street or even the Dreamy Draw and onto North Mountain Park.    Just remember: No matter how far you've gone, you're only halfway there -- you still have to come back!  and pick up after your dogs

Make whatever jokes you want about the name as if you're a homophobic 7th grade boy, but Dick's Hideaway has really got a great menu of American food.   Might not be a burger, fry, and shake diner, but New Mexican cuisine is American all the way, and as a matter of fact, among their many southwestern tinged dishes, they've got a superb thick, juicy burger, grilled up on an open flame right in front of you as you sit at the bar, with some great fries AND a nice full plate of dark green salad for somewhere around 11 bucks-ish (last I was aware).

Another stop on my recent free chip tourney poker binge.  This is exactly what you want in a neighborhood bar.    Grungy enough looks to keep the pretentious hip crowd away, and super friendly atmosphere inside.    A neighborhood that gives you an uneasy feeling, that goes away and drifts to downright comfortable once you're inside a short while.  A server or two who look like they're in their late 30's to late 50's, who call you "Hun" repeatedly.  A limited menu of bar classics, cooked up right in front of the bar.  No fancy vending machines, but a nifty "insert quarter/spin handle/ grab nuts or m&ms with palm of other hand" type of old school vendor.  Haven't tried it, but I've heard tell of their great burgers for years.

The idea of paying for a self-wash seemed a little silly, but after trying it at home and making a big mess -- only to end up with the dog outside in the mud within minutes after the bathing, and leaving them so moist that a funky smell develops as they dry -- it became an obvious and worthwhile choice.  My first experience with self-wash, at a nearby competitor, was horrible, but my time at Wag&Wash was so much better.  The facility here is clean and fairly spacious.  The stainless steel tubs are sturdy, and the spray equipment and drains all worked well.  They had a rubber brush to use on the dog's fur while sudsing and washcloths available for cleaning ears, etc.  I did have a little trouble with the suction-cup-leash that was supposed to hold my 70 lb dog secured to the front side of the tub.   It didn't.   A wet dog jumping over the edge of a slippery wet stainless steel tub that's elevated several feet over a slippery wet tile floor is not a healthy combination for the poor dog, who pulled a "Bambi on ice" and comically (but i'm sure painfully) spread all four limbs out in all directions and landed face first on the floor.  I asked for a non-suction-cup leash and secured him to a bar at front of the tub afterwards, but damage done.  Just go with the basic wash; the pricing options for various extras aren't worth it.  Why pay an extra several dollars for a specific scent of shampoo, when there isn't a conditioner with the same scent, since the conditioner is what the dog ends up smelling like afterwards, not the shampoo?  The blow dryers were powerful enough to blow out not only the water, but lots of leftover hair.  Sometimes the nozzle end blew off the hose, but i'd rather have the blowers be too hard than too soft.  I feed rawmeatybones, so i didn't shop the food selection much, but the premium brands offered are expectedly pricey.  I did pick up a rubber brush for cheap de-furring.  I will be back to use my frequent washer card.  Check out the pic of poor, wet, sad Doogie.

This joint might be the shit, but I'll never know.  I am confident in my formula for a good thai place: a grungy, ghetto-fied exterior with a clean and tidy interior packed with actual thai folk.  Excited by the nasty, dirty exterior of the building and its sketchy location, I was disappointed to find the inside to be less than spotless.  I was quickly, if nonchalantly, greeted and seated with a menu, among about 2-3 other full tables.  After sitting over 10 minutes with nary a glass of water or a peep out of the staff, I had hope that the approaching server was on the way to take my order.  Alas, my hopes were dashed when the server went to the table that was already busy enjoying their meal and proceeded to take a To-Go order from them, so that it could be ready when they left.  Seeing that the other two tables hadn't received food yet, and had been there long enough to deplete their thai teas completely, I was very upset to know that I would be sitting starving, waiting for my food to be cooked AFTER these folks who were already eating their food had their To-Go order cooked.    Uh uh.  I left the menu I'd nearly memorized by this point and my non-existent glass of water on the table and skeedaddled.

CHEESE AND RICE!!!!  If you only make 3 muhfuggin things, you'd better make those 3 muhfuggin things gosh darned well, by golly!  The burger was only a buck-69, sure, but it was dinky, and it wasn't going to matter *how* I used it; there just wasn't enough meat. [insert joke about how "I'm not used to that" here...bahdumbump]  GOT DOWN SAT ON A BENCH!!!!!  I sat as the first car in the drive through, after having paid and gotten my drink, for literally 8 minutes, knowing full well that I'd only ordered a single burger and fries, wondering what the creative curses the poor folks behind me were hurling at me for thinking that I'd ordered the whole store. Sure, it was 12:30-ish, but I watched about ten orders go out the front counter in this time.  Again, no exaggeration.   If the orders were in fact being passed out in turn, and the inside counter had gotten that backed up, that's a pretty sad thing. Finally the food...  fuh-DANG-ah!!!!!!!       Dem buns was greeeezy!!!  I first noticed that the inner wrapping paper had acheived that completely see-through window effect that Dr Nick recommended Homer look for as his ticket to gaining enough weight to achieve Disability status.    I unfolded the drippy paper to find that I could literally squeeze drips of grease out of the bun like a saturated sponge, but only on one half, mind you!  The other half of the bun had edges that were hard enough to warrant 'bird-food status' for any bread product in my household.  The one napkin I'd been given was useless, since it had been purposely draped over the french fries, presumably to keep them warm(?)  Luckily, I had a stash in the car....of NAPKINS, silly.    `,8^}     I will say, since I found that slimy thing and the cool limp fries that went with it inedible, that the girl inside was quick to offer my refund, but also quick to make it clear that she wasn't really listening to any of the comments I was providing, but instead was chosing to blow me off as Mr Angry Customer.    I guess I had already shown my cards by letting slip a comment similar to:  "If you only make 3 muhfuggin things, you'd better make those 3 muhfuggin things gosh darned well, by golly!"  (but not verbatim~ahem~)

These ratings are all about comparison, as fellow yelper RandH recently pointed out in a review.  Well, this park isn't perfect, but by golly, compared to other dog parks within the city of phoenix, this one's pretty NICE! (Glendale and Chandler are much better - I'm working towards a future list i think)   I know....the 'hood. I'll admit it's not the best, but on a saturday morning with the park full of soccer game family traffic I doubt too heinous of crimes are going down here. You can park on the street right next to the park fence if you're nervous and want to keep your vehicle within view. I can't comment on others' nighttime experiences, but it does say the park's open until 10pm, so if they're not well-lit, that's a negative.   There is a huge area for big dogs and a good sized one for yippers, too. The arrangement of seating and shade is quite nice. There are plenty of mature trees providing real shade, and the grass is well taken care of. Too bad that a 'visual minority' of idiot owners litter cigbutts and leave dog crap behind. You have to wonder what these peoples' homes look like. X^ {   The people I met that day were friendly and conscientious of their mutts. It is sad that this is also something I've found to not always be in abundance at the local dog parks.   No fancy dog agility equipment here like some other cities' bark parks, but anyone who goes to one of the tiny chain link kennel runs at Grovers Basin Dog Park or Avondale Friendship Dog Park should really make the drive and check it out sometime.   Your dogs will love you for it. Oh wait, your dog loves you even when you yell at it because YOU'RE grumpy or when you accidentally step on it during the night, so how about : your dog will love you MORE for giving it even more variety of sights, socialization, and pee-mail from canines they've never met before!

I thought this dog park was a little sucky until I visited a few other Phoenix dogs parks.  Now I know that as far a PHOENIX dog parks go, this one is actually pretty darned nice.   Now, compared to Glendale, Scottsdale, Chandler, different story. But for Phoenix, this one is large, has lots of grass, nice working water stations with large buckets, separate sides for big and little dogs, and most of the people are pretty decent, too.  That being said, if you're a person who:      a)  doesn't know the difference between a big and little dog (or at least one that can handle itself amongst the big guys and one that can't),      b)  doesn't know how to pick up after your dog,      c)  wants to bring a toddler or a stroller for cryin-out-loud,      d)  doesn't want to pay attention to your dog and let it shit or fight or whatever while you socialize and smoke cigarettes on your lawn chairs in a big semi-circle,       e)  doesn't know the difference between aggressive play and an aggressive dog, and chooses to display this ignorance by chucking a full 1.5 liter Dasani water bottle at full velocity towards a group of 3+ dogs who just happened to be playing near your big dumb St Bernard when it decided to pussy out and *Yelp* as it dropped to the ground (in a typically submissive dog-language move)  ...then just don't bother coming in the gate here, and let the rest of us have a good natured, clean, healthy, fun time.  Oh, yeah, if the softball goonies are here they come in droves and parking sucks - i see a lot of people go across the street and park in the convention center lot, but your dog will love you even more if you park down the street in one of the other Rose Mofford Sports Complex lots, and walk through the park on the winding sidewalks to get to the dog run area.

Mom's Day.   Dad's Day.   Let's just make up one and call it Black Bear Diner Day, and I'll gladly go for breakfast, even if I have to endure a little wait.  The orange juice is freshly squeezed, comes in a large glass, and  tastes like cutting an orange in half and making sweet oral love to it. The food is really good.  Everything except the bear claw, ironically, but really, everything else, from fresh fruit, to griddle items, to biscuits&gravy, to even a cheapo steak & eggs has been certified as yummy by either myself or a close family member anywhere from kid to grandparents.    Service ranges from acceptable to nice and friendly, and with the tiny bear paws running the length of their kooky suspenders as part of their uniforms, you hardly even notice most of them have freaky punky tattoos up and down their necks,etc.  Breakfast is a 4.5 over several occaisions, and I'm factoring in one late lunch experience at around a 3.75-4.  Black berry shake is a fizzle to the -ive point oh, fo' sho'

Discount ftw!  Easily 4.5 * (not 5 since they don't seem to wheel and deal on the price as much as they used to)  A couple weeks after getting a flat on a remote trail, I get another flat on a forest road out somewhere between Strawberry and Camp Verde.   Luckily, my trusty crappy spare was still working, so on it went and off I went.  A mile or two out, still deep in the forest with no cell coverage, a two inch rock shaped like a fucking triangular arrowhead gashed its way into my spare which then hissed itself to death.  Me, my 13 yo girl [edited from  "a 13 yo girl" so as not to sound so creepy!], and two dogs then set out on a moonlit, muddy footed, half hour journey back to the spot where everyone else was camping for the night.    We stayed until morning, and with everyone's generosity (campers rule!) ate a hearty breakfast and had a loaned spare tire installed with plenty of help (can I Yelp these guys? Five stars!)   Home now, and I've gone shopping for tires at Pep Boy's (old dude gave crappy cust service - i know you don't only have one tire for me to choose from), Wal Mart (charges extra for everything if you have TPMS), and Firestone (decent price with buy 3, get 1 'free', but warranty can't compare to Discount).  Back to Dicount I go, again, as I knew I probably would.  I'm a loyal customer for over a decade now.  Friendly, helpful, intelligent customer service.  Took the time to explain why their warranty is so different and so much better than the standard or even the extra warranty you can purchase elsewhere.  These guys give free repairs, whether you bought the tire there or not, using the philosophy that it's free for customers, and you're a customer that just hasn't bought tires, yet, but you will be back when you do need them.  Shitchyeah!  That's practically Miracle on 34th Street, right there.

When a place called Pink Cabaret shows up on the list of free chip tourney poker venues [ http://playnpt.com/ ] it only takes a few seconds for the brain to process...."wait, we can go to the crappy wanna-be dive as usual over near Ghettrocenter, or drive a couple extra miles and play at a strip club?  Let's go!"  The poker players get in without any cover charge, but are relegated to a side-room area WITHOUT a view of the main stage and bar. Early in the evening, the service stank back there, *FORCING* one to go out into the main room where all the dancers were in order to visit the bartenderess.   The burlesque-attired cocktail waitresses were able to come around more often once biz picked up and more servers arrived.  They were friendly, but I found myself jealous of the greater amount of attention the obvious regulars were getting.  Very homey atmosphere for a boobybar. Although I didn't partake in any of their services, the dancers were friendly, and I think most guys/gals could find their own personal favorite style or type from among the variety of ladies.  Impressive pole work going on up there!  The digs themselves were nearly topnotch.  This building must only be a couple of years old, at most, and compared to other venues, it REALLY shows in the cleanliness (or at least lack of griminess) of the tables and chairs, bar, bathrooms, carpeting, etc.    The crowd was friendly, but considering the West Side location I'd recommend not to come flaunting a big mouth, if I knew I was the type of person who needs to watch that sort of thing (DarenC). 8^ )  A local caterer was running a BBQ smoker out front, selling pulled pork, etc but it wasn't quite ready yet when I was leaving.  They don't run a storefront, but I think it was H&H Catering, or E&H, or N&N - sorry, dude, get better signage!  Anyway, it smelled delicious and he was really friendly, so I plan to try it out next time.  My personal pet peeve, the Male Bathroom Attendant, was in residence, though.  Nice guy, but c'mon, you think on a Wednesday night we need a breath mint guy handing us paper towels?!?  I don't think so.  As a matter of fact, let's do away with this ridiculous fixture once and for all.  You women don't have to deal with a matronly old bag sitting there on a stool, collecting tips for perfume samples and spare pads, do you?  I didn't think so.  This is nothing a decent vending machine couldn't handle.  Plus I feel sorry for the guy -- I mean, at least he's not a human signpost out in the sun, but what a crap job. I'll be back here for more free poker, because its got more nipples showing than Bullshooters [http://www.yelp.com/biz/bull-shooters-inc-phoenix#hrid:bYK0DGz8LSGZfZCdkEjX8g ], and because the boobies I see are not on old Native dudes like at Wild Bill's  [ http://www.yelp.com/biz/wild-bills-saloon-phoenix#hrid:sCd6p_CiAVonqLF0N-8PmA ]

I'm updating my review, but not of the club itself, only for the BBQ caterer and my comments about the bathroom attendant.  I still hate the bathroom attndt concept, but Arnold is a genuine dude who will engage you in real conversation (meaning he will listen and respond to what you said, too, not just talk at you ).  He presents a great argument about throwback-style service, that used to be the norm whenever the high-falutin' went out lounging for coctails, and he truly enjoys *service* - not just handing you gum, but interacting with you as a fellow human being.  As far as bathroom attd's in general, I'm a convert, as long as the guy on the stool is as cool as my new buddy, Arnold.  Now the BBQ - shitchyea.!  This trailer smoker is brought out here by W & W Catering, owned by the Woods brothers.  John(?) was again super friendly, eager to talk about his ingredients, methods, or anything else for that matter.  He offers pulled pork, chicken, smoky links, and i think brisket, too, kept warm and smokey with a real smoker fired with glowing hot red mesquite wood.  You can get a styrofoam plate with the full meal of meat, beans, corn cob, roll for $10.   Or, you can get just a sammich for $5.   There's no fork involved with the pulled pork.  He donned a plastic glove, grabbed the hunk of pork shoulder, and started pulling off chucks to chop up a bit and stuff into a kaiser.  Topped off with a scoop of tangy and sweet sauce that you can taste the wood in, and I was as close to heaven as one can get standing outside of a strip club on the other side of the tracks in the industrial West valley. 8^ |  Dinner gets a plate, but sammich is served on sheets of tin foil.  Bits of tin are not fun to find crimped between your molars, but I guess I'll take the blame, myself, for having been the one in control of my mouth and chompers.  The Woods bros dont have a brick & mortar that they sell from - *yet*

"That's all you need to know, right there, " she said, pointing up behind her head at a framed plackard from local news affiliate CBS 5 Dean's List.   It was dated from like 1996, or 2003, or something like that, I can't remember, but it wasn't very recent. "What's that got to do with Customer Service?" I asked, completely perplexed.   I was just trying to tell her that I've had the same thing happen here twice now in two visits, where she is attending to personal business instead of her customer, ie me.   "Go on. (waving towards the door)  We been here 17 years.  We don't need YOU." "You haven't even listened to me.  I'm going to have to tell somebody about this." "I don't care.  I dont need to listen.  I'M the owner. Go." (she starts pacing back and forth behind the counter, like a caged animal or a person about to get in a fight) "You're the ONLY owner?  So you're saying your PARENTS work for YOU?  Here, and down the street at BurgerMania?" "I'm the owner.   I don't care."  A customer standing next to me, who's already received her order but has been waiting the entire time, come to find out, for Mrs. Rude to scoop her an ice cream cone, chimes in with, "I don't think she WANTS to listen to you."  You think?!       Moments earlier, I'd stood at the counter ready to order, while she was digging red plastic baskets out of one of the trash containers in the lobby.  She saw me, and proceeded to continue what she was doing without acknowledging me, for a few more moments.  Then she comes around the counter  -- no hand washing -- and proceeds to take my order.   $7.03 ... hand her my card, she swipes it but doesn't press any buttons on the card machine or the cash register.   ~ On her phone laying on the counter, she continues the texting she originally started while taking my order. ~ It's taking forever, and she keeps going back and forth between the credit card reading machine and her phone laying on the counter.      -a few buttons pressed over here, -a few buttons pressed over there Finally, I say "Forget it, this is the second time you've done something like this to me recently, and it's not acceptable to me.  I'm taking my business elsewhere."   "I WAS WAITING FOR THE MACHINE! "  she lamely attempts to defend. "You were on the phone instead of doing what you should have been doing." "Go ahead.  I don't care.  That's all you need to know right there."  .......and now you're up to date, back at the top of the review.  WAIT!  I forgot to tell you about what happened last time:  I go for a late lunch, and I'm after a Falafel sandwich, easy enough. Into a near empty dining room walks your humble narrator, and there's no one waiting in line at all, since it's 1 ish already.   A single patron is waiting at the counter for his food, engaged in personal conversation with our villain, Mrs Rude.  As I stand patiently behind Chatty Customer Man, Mrs Rude makes no effort to wrap it up or otherwise acknowledge me as a waiting customer, despite having already made indisputable eye contact.    "Shit, Did they just change subjects?!?" I'm thinking to myself, as I make the Universal Signal for depicting the perfect combination of Hunger and Readiness at a food ordering counter -- I caused my keys to jingle in my hands.    I literally stood at an empty counter while they chatted for a full minute and a half before I decided to turn and begin walking away. I didn't rush, since there were a few Mother-May-I-Giant-Steps between me and the exit, and I would have gladly turned back if called upon.  But she let me go, and now I know why.  Mr Gyro doesn't need my business. Mr Gyro doesn't need your business.  And if Mrs Rude does, in fact, speak on behalf of the entire ownership of Mr Gyro, well, then I guess   Mr Gyro doesn't even WANT our business.   So be it.

Since I live less than a half mile away, I've seen a lot of Asiana's ups and downs over the past few years. Lately, things are much improved over times past  (surely, shiny, new competitor LF on Bell opening up created some incentive). Overall, me likee.   The non-food aisle is great fun to explore, with everything from kitchen gadgets, knives, pots & pans, more shapes and sizes of ice cube trays than you've probably seen in one place, and who even knows what this thing is supposed to be used for?!     This is where I purchased my lawnmower. Okay, so it's really a rough-cast 8' steelbladed sickle on a wooden handle; mow and edge your entire front lawn with one and watch your neighborly interactions quickly achieve great improvements! (My step-dad may have been certifiable, but tthat doesn't mean I didn't learn a useful thing or two from him. One dirty pearl of wisdom I'll pass on to you from his philosophy, is that unless you're talking about tthe kids & neighborhood you grew up with, the best possible relationship you can ever hope to have with your adult neighbors is one of "leaving each other the ℉#¢% alone", and hand-mowing your lawn with an 8' sickle pretty much establishes this for you.   You need a collander and tub to wash some greens? They have pint-sized all the way up to give-your-75lb-dog-a-bath-sized, in plastic or stainless steel. Hey, no Asian/dog jokes -- nearly half the store and customers are eastern European or Indian.   But speaking of dogs, I used to get mine fresh fish from the butcher area once a week but not so much anymore. They've revamped that area of the store so that the mongers are still there cutting and gutting the day's seafood & other meats, but they do it behind a tall barrier, package the results on plastic-wrapped foam trays, tag and shelve it. No more customer interaction, which is to me a big disappointment.   I had preferred to feed my beasts a less processed fish than most humans want for themselves, but no longer have a choice. Also sad about discontinuation of the sale of salmon heads, which I know was very popular for a lot of other customers. (Perfect meat:bone ratio for raw-fed dogs, and apparently for soup-fed people, and was only 99c/lb.)     Other treats like chickenfeet or pigsfeet are actually more expensive here than western grocery stores, because they're more popular for regular use., not considered scrap.  I know of no place else in the immediate area that a person so inclined could purchase a skinned, whole  frozen sheep's head.  Good to know, in case neighborly relations need some additional fine-tuning.  Produce is pretty good here - very reasonably priced for most items, and much variety. Sure, they're less picky about "ugly" fruits and veggies, causing you to pick and choose a bit to find the better specimens, but I do that anyway at any other store's pyramid piles of so called Perfect looking produce, don't  you?  (Besides, ugly pieces are more likely to have fully ripened prior to being harvested, so taste better than the prematurely plucked alternative.)    My favorites are their ever-present stock of both pickling and Persian cucumbers, and the tasty, tiny red or white potatoes, loose, not hidden in a tinted bag, for 69c/lb.    I may never know what 75% of this store even is, but I like it's funky personality, and yes, it's funky scent, too.

Upgrading to 3.75  JT's menu seems to expand everytime i go; it's quite extensive.  When you get it in sandwich form, they toast their pita bread a little more than other places and I really dig it like this. They always have super fresh bright green leaf lettuce here - not pale, lifeless iceburg.  JT presented my falafel sandwich without sauce so that he could offer a new sauce on the side for me to try.  He described it as a little spicy, but sweet, too, since it was made with mango.  I can't remember the name.  I'll just call it chili-mango sauce. It tasted a little like Taquis

This 2.5 had been *generously* rounded up to a 3, but no longer....  I went to Culver's, basically.  Now I get what Freddy's is trying to be.  Although Freddy's has a mythology that  lays claim to being the originator of the burger style, Culver's just does it better.   http://www.yelp.com/biz/culvers-phoenix#hrid:yDsMVl72kItXdkeWUKHLog  They do everything better.  From friendly customer service, cleanliness, to the fresh and tasty food; and the thick yet crisp on the outside crinkle cut frys were simply a model of perfection on the delicate Greasy~Crispy Spectrum.  The basic sundae automaticaly comes with 2 flavors of topping, so they aren't trying to unfairly skrimp you for skrilla left and right with extras.  Very cool, Culver's!   Boo Freddy's for being so lackluster with customer service, overseasoned with food, and generally failing.

"Make something as generic as possible to appeal to as mass a crowd as we can" must have been the proprietor's business plan.  This place reminded me of the "sports-bar-like" area inside of a Chili's, only overgrown into the entire establishment.  Annoying decor, staff,  and, yes, crowd too.  They had the same football game on every single TV in the house, even those screens right next to each other.  Nothing but stupid logic there.  They also used this football game as an excuse to postpone the start of the scheduled poker game that they'd agreed to host, but only because they wouldn't use one of the TVs to show the poker stat screen.  Whistle!  Penalty!  Lame.

Inspired by recent Talk, this rating simply must be updated.  Fatburger has a QUALITY-quality that places it in a wierd limbo between other fast food burgers and places like Fuddruckers.  If you are a fan of the king, either of the two clowns, or the red haired girl, then Fatburger is likely to feel too expensive and that it takes too long.  However, 'you get what you pay for' and 'good things are worth waiting for'.    Freshness, a multitude of assembly choices, and overall quality are big standouts at Fatburger.  The employees at this location have always been friendly and courteous.  Tuesdays: buy a combo, get another burger free!

Robek's is yummy.  They've got me addicted to what ever they call their concoction with OJ, Strawberries, Blueberries, frozen yogurt, and I get soy protein and/or vitamins added.  They are a little higher priced than Jamba, but they taste way better. Jamba's vitamin add-in always makes my smoothies taste like one of my high-school science teachers always smelled -- like alternating between sticking your nose in a freshly opened bottle of vitamins and and in an old lady's butt --  but Robek's doesn't taste like that; their's is good.  The staff always gives you a friendly hello, the second you walk through the door, the ultra-promptness of which makes it seem a bit fake at times.  Service is pretty quick and efficient for a smoothie joint.  Never had the food, but they offer very limited assortment of prepacked sandwiches.  If you're cheap like me, watch for BOGO smoothie coupons in the newpaper circulars a few times a year.

They still stand out in the walkway with a platter of samples, mostly trying to lure the lemmings out of the line to jump off the Mc-Cliff next door. They landed me with an unbarbed, straight hook (a toothpick) and some tastey bait made up of bread, chicken, cheese, bacon, and some sort of sauce. I didn't even ask the name, I just said I wanted whatever that chick is giving out, and a few minutes later I was eating a giant sized version of the teaser.   Apparently their specialty is the philly cheese steak style sammiches, but I'm not sure I'd try anything new for a while this sammy was s ogood, unless the platter chick is out fishing again with some new bait!

My best friends in the world, past and present, have come from the Humane Society.    Multiple experiences with this Sunnyslope location have shown me that they are full of wonderful, caring staff, much of which operates on volunteer basis. They've always been clean (as much as possible) and friendly, and even if their rules are a pain to me, such as waiting for them to get ahold of a former apt complex before they'd let the cat go home with me, those rules are designed for the best interest of the most pets possible. I've dealt with the dog, cat, and little critter depts, and had positive experiences with them all, as far as adoptions.  I've also dealt directly with the vet and vaccinations offices, and had positive experiences with everything from simple shots to euthanasia.  Previous reviewer Kate G has had a single experience that, while sounding horrible, is also only giving one side of the story. Her one star review is not a fair assessment of the kind of situation that she put the shelter in, and how they were forced to deal with it.  Bringing any new animals into the shelter, stray or not, is dangerous, and quaranteen-like circumstances exist.  They have rules to follow, and they have to be very strict about them for the protection of other animals already in the shelter.  Going through the volunteer orientations should have given a chance for this concept to be learned and its importance understood, but I guess not.  I can see how it would be hard to understand what happened if you just plain don't understand what happened, but this shelter does not deserve to be unilaterally slandered like this.  She gave up responsibility for the pups to AZHS because she didn't want to take on that responsibility herself; with that responsibility, AZHS made what they determined to be the best decision for the pups and all other animals in their shelter - to put them down.  Sad, yes, but likely altruistic on the whole.  AZHS brought me some of my best friends, and although like any organization they must be kept in check, the services received at this place are really wonderful.

Flour. Sugar. Butter. Egg.  Big.  Friggin.  Whoop.  Didn't go in, but they were delivered to my office.  Had two flavors - both were okay, but so sugary that they tasted pretty much the same.  Frosting tasted distinct at least, and was decent frosting, but there was actually too much of it piled up there.  (I hear an elderly Jewish man in the background of my review right now, saying in a most stereotypical Jackie Mason voice, "I should have such problems.")  I guess this is a clear example of an establishment setting a higher standard for itself with their pricing point, presentation, and marketing, and then not being able to live up to that standard.    A $0.50 cupcake from a girlscout bakesale may not have the prestige or cachet, but I'd bet that the girl or her mom at least stirred the batter properly before putting it in the little cups.    One of my cupcakes had the unstirred situation happening -- where one bite was flour-y, the next almost tasted baking soda-y for some reason.    Inexcusable.  There is a sliding scale for judging those places that charge premium prices.  That means this cupcake gets a 2 star rating, while the bakesale homejob from the box would get 4 stars.    Because it's not trying to be something it's not.  Flour. Sugar. Butter. Egg.  Take that, lemmings.  Bourgeois be B&.

A nice different option for lunch, my brother and I enjoyed the burgers recently.  They were offered in an assortment of sizes and toppings, but since it was the first time there, I opted for a plain burger on a pretzel bun.  The flavor and consistency, while not the best in town, was pretty nice, and actually surprisingly good for 'bar food'.   Service was decent, although for the lunch hour it really wasn't very busy at all.  I think I would like to come here for llunch again, and try something different, although the menu isn't that large, and for a craving for a burger I will choose another place.  I guess this is around 3.65, but i'll round 'em up.  What can I say? The black and white photos on the walls of sexy chicks with their plumber's cracks exposed ('half moon") may have swayed me.

If you've ever been an inebriated bachelor and piled whatever you found in your fridge in between two slices of bread or into a tortilla,  or perhaps a struggling mother who feeds her family a hearty mash-up of Whatever once a week on Leftover Night,  then you'll appreciate "The King of the Sandwiches".  Don't be afraid of rubbing elbows with your fellow patrons, or of a little grease running down from your overstuffed-torta-compressing hand all the way to that elbow.  Try somethign that sounds loco -- it won't be that hard.  A couple of the choices contain basically everything you could think of to put on a sandwich, and then some.  Actually, you could get a single sandwich that contains the innards of about a half dozen sandwiches all at once.  Epiphany~  LRDLT's Del Rey and Las Reynas sandwiches are essentially the Turduken of torta shop tortas.

In grade school, one of my best friends, Pranav, had me over his house a couple of times for dinner.  His mom cooked the most bizarre, yet flavourful food my near-virginal midwestern tastebuds had ever yet encountered.  At the time, I remember not really being sure I liked it, and at the same time craving to go back and have some more!  When I recently began to work nearby to India Palace and saw their sign for the lunch boofay, I thought back to those days in Pranav's stinky house and marched right inside with my 9 bucks in hand.  They are a little more classy than the pay-first boofays, as you are seated and served drinks by waiters, and will get your bill later.    At first glance, the bufett table seemed smallish to me, but once I started scooping out the various gloops onto my pile of rice & veggies, it really added up fast.  There were plenty of choices labeled as Meat/No Meat, and with the dishes' names, although I still had to consult the menu to decipher what gloop I was scooping.  For the non-adventurous in your family or group, there is some nice almost-plain jasmine rice and tandoori chicken (simple skinless barbecued chicken pieces that taste like the best picnic cooked-over-a-charcoal-grill chicken you can remember).  For those a little more adventurous, just try it all.  They do not stock the exact same items each day, so it is a must to go on different days to sample all you can.  You can round out your meal with some fresh veggies, although not really a full fledged salad-bar (not like the veg-heads don't have plenty to choose from here), and I loooooove the mango chutney, mint/cilantro/whatever sauce, and tamarind sauce.  I get a big bowl of each and use it all up -- NO WASTE!  Goes great with the freshly made naan bread that you get with your meal.  My grade school friend Pranav is a big-shot doctor now in Boston, but I'd love to have that chance to take him here and find out if it's as authentic as it seems to be.  Judging by the large volume of Indian clientelle that I always see here, it probably is.   I always find that to be a great way to judge any ethnic eatery or grocery store.    Watch out for the (anise?) near the register.  It's not as close to an after-dinner mint as I was led to believe.  PS: not sure if others would have the same experience, but my 12 y.o. did NOT like this place at all, and since they stop the 'Kid's Price' quite young,at like 9 or so here, I learned to save my cash and not bring her.

I just had a wonderful conversation during lunch with the friendly owners, Mr and Mrs Dosanjh.  I commented that I always see them eat their own food right from the buffet table (unlike the staff at many chinese boofays), and he was happy to proclaim that he and she eat lunch there everyday -- his son two meals a day!  And why not?  It is delicious, wholesome home cooking, after-all.   When the people who created -- or inherited -- all of the recipes tell you that everything in the restaurant is made *from scratch*, while literally breaking bread with you, it really has a special meaning.  I got to share my story about my grade school buddy, and let them know about Yelp.  Their friendly interaction is something I've already come to expect from the rest of the staff, so it was nothing shocking.  Today's assortment of dishes was excellent, with all of my favorites, a spicy bean sprout dish I'd never seen before, and also more fresh veggies now than in my original review.   Veggie-potato fritters (can't remember the indian name) were zesty and not greasy at all.  Chicken curry had so much savory flavor without being spicy at all, it literally made my mouth water just sniffing it.   The Tandoori chicken aroma grabbed ahold of me in the parking lot where I first smelled it as I stepped out of my car, and had me floating through the air like a cartoon riding on the scent vapors, all the way into the front doors.    When the people who created -- or inherited -- all of the recipes tell you that everything in the restaurant is made *from scratch*, while literally breaking bread with you, it really has a special meaning.

Lunch boofay the other day with my brother and his coworker was one of the best tasting lunches I've had here.  My recommendations:  ask for Garlic Naan instead of plain, but be ready for fresh garlic breath all afternoon.  Go several times, since the about half of dishes they have out vary from day to day.  I've discovered that sometimes I'm not a fan of the items, but have been glad to try new things, since I've also found some unexpected gems. (don't expect me to remember the indian name, though)  Don't worry about crazy gimmicky coupon sites that just want to spam you all day.  This food is superb at the fair price they charge normally.  The owners are great, and staff is friendly and eager to serve.

I absolutely despise feeling like I've been judged not worth someone's time due to their assumptions about my financial status based on my outward appearance. And this time it wasn't even by a girl in a G-String on a pole!  Okay, so anyone who reads my reviews knows I'm not regularly dining high on the hog, but don't the beautiful rich people slum around in workout gear sometimes, too?  So after a recent run down Central Ave, one of my K9's and I decided to partake in a little of the awesome concept Donald S calls RETOXIFYING.  A little snack and some wine out on the patio sounded great to me, so I went over to Bomberos.  It was early in the day, so they weren't at all busy, there were only a couple of other customers either inside or out.  I walked in and out between the patio and the inside seating area several times over a few moments, purposefully contorting my face into the restaurant patron's "where do I go?" look.  Since the server's work station and door to the kitchen area were in that narrow hallway, I actually was in the way of the couple of servers who were there trying to move to and from the two dining areas.  I did not get greeted at all, either before or after I had to stop one of them and ask for a menu.   I sat and reviewed the menu for a several minutes, all the while continuing my confused, helpless patron routine.  Nothing.  With nary a peep out of the servers, I walked away.  My tendency to frequent $ instead of $$$$ places comes less from a lack of means than it does from my countless experiences that what you get for your $$$$ is often not worth it.   If I have a 2* experience at a $ restaurant, I may be a little upset, but if I have a 2* experience at a $$$$ establishment, I'm going to be postally pioughd.  Bomberos may treat you like one of the Sunnyslope Elite, if you show up looking like you are one of the Sunnyslope Elite.  Maybe then their overpriced wine and admittedly tasty looking nosh might seem worth it.  (It IS all from South America)  Without friendly or at least minimally cordial customer service, they can stuff it up their stuffy butts.  I ended up stopping at a nasty dirty nearby Sonic (limited options due to the dog, remember) where both the order-taking electronic voice and the rollerskate-less carhop both had the decency to ask me how I was doing that day.

I dug it, but I'm not gushing out stars like gametes, here, as some...  Well, even if you're not a gyro lover, Chicago Gyros still has plenty to make you full and happy.  The falafel sandwich and big mound of fries stuffed into the lunch basket was filling and cooked just right. My tiny taste of the heavily seasoned chicken gyro meat, i think it was, left me craving more of the savory flavor.  The owner cooks up fresh hot food even late night after the restaurant closes for patrons of the Poker Union http://www.yelp.com/biz/poker-union-phoenix#hrid:IooN-FXYZ_TDj3B8iHptoA Cool!

O'Donoghue's is quite a smooth, chill place.   $2 HH beers that even includes things like Blue Moon and Full Sail amber is a pretty smokin deal.    ...and all day HH on Saturday!  It seems that if you'd like to stalk or otherwise find and meet BrianS, this is your best bet!  After the recent attempts to recruit yelpers after the wine tasting soiree, a scant few of us shared great company and hilarious conversation at Brian's local version of Cheers.   But since it's irish, there was plenty of craic to go along with the beer and whiskey being served.  Funny I can get a better (cheaper) happy hour deal by driving from near Ghettrocenter to near Grayhawk!   8^ P

Good food and actually good customer service!  This is a new ownership compared to the last incarnation under a different name, and they are much improved! The food is varied and of decent quality; my Discard Pile* was very small.  There was an assortment of seafood, pork, beef, chicken, and vegetable dishes.  Nothing I had was too greasy, either.  The only item I'm used to that I missed was bean sprouts.  I dug the honey chicken and orange chicken, the pork spare ribs were nice even though the sauce was too sweet, but the beef short ribs tasted too much like plain old roast beef.  I don't like mushrooms but would bet that most folks would appreciate their unusual addition to the inside of the springroll style eggrolls.    The real standout for me that day was the customer service.   In a boofay? I know! My experience at Fuji Boofay was the exact opposite of China Star http://www.yelp.com/biz/china-star-super-buffet-phoenix-2#hrid:CjQqXNGlBOFi-aVdY6VWIw   Allow me to briefly elaborate (ooh nice oxymoron)  I walked in and had already noticed the quite clear signage stating that lunch lasted until 3:30pm and dinner began at 3:35pm.    It was 3:32pm. [dun dun DUUUHHHNNNN]  I braced myself for the worse (see China Star review), when the smiley young lady at the counter asked,  "Do you want lunch or dinner?" "I get to choose!?  Well, I don't eat any seafood." "Okay, lunch then.  You'll pay later."   ...and I'm led to my seat. Yea_eah. I think I like that kind of service very much.  I will come back when ever I get my vehicle serviced next door.   * I measure the quality of a boofay, especially its meat items, by the size of the pile of grisle, fat, and ? that is uneaten and cut off or spit out onto the plate.  Of course, smaller is better when it comes to the Discard Pile!

I've enjoyed the Waterfall trail both with and without water and it is way better with, of course, but it was neat to be able to hike right into the cool, shady crevice that the pool occupies when it is there.  I've enjoyed the Waterfall trail both before and after the installation of all the boundary rails and informative signage.  I understand the need for the railings and found the information, well, informative, but my overall enjoyment of the site dwindled on this more recent visit, compared to my previous visit, when the primitive trail and barrier-free view of the petroglyphs left me overwhelmed with imagineerings of the hussle and bustle that this area once must have been full of.    Maybe the maintenance they do here means there's no broken glass to get in my dogs' feet?  Nope, albeit admittedly there's less here than many local parks.  PS: Was I supposed to pay or something?

For those wondering, the restaurant.com coupons work fine, however the incompetent staff at Il Posto couldn't and/or wouldn't figure out 18% for the included gratuity.  The coupon clearly states that it would be included, so no surprise there..... ...but a big WTF when I realized looking at the receipt that they had either purposefully or accidentally calculated exactly 20% as the autogratuity.  Now by saying it may have been an accident, I'm really pushing things and trying to be nice because I overall liked the place.  I cannot honestly come up with an explanation as to how a person who'd graduated 4th grade math could read a peice of paper saying 18% and then calculate 20%, unless is was blatantly done on purpose with the idea that the customer wasn't going to figure it out.  SHAME SHAME SHAME  The decor here is a mish-mash of old and new, good and bad, nice and ugly.  They've recently done (some) remodeling, since I saw a huge dumpster in the parking lot, but they aren't finished inside.  There are huge areas where exposed surfaces are in need of paint or drywall, and a huge sheet of plastic hung in a doorway behind us, swooshing with every breeze of a server walking by. The outside patio area did indeed look very neato, like a street in italy or new york.  Inside, they have a dining area with warm wood accents, a lit-up fountain, and dim lighting (which i liked, but the mrs said was making her feel woozy) right next to the kitchen area's flourescent light fixtures and flourescent lime green paint.  What classiness the first area had was lost with barely a shift of your glance, since there's no wall or anything separating the two areas. The very uncomfortable booths have hard wood back and a butt cushion that's token at best, with the bottom of the seat being way too long, so your back can't reach the seatback so you are forced to chose between sitting upright with no backrest at all, or slouching so badly that a painful arch is in your middle back.  The food had good and bad, as well.  The bread basket with pesto dip was superb, and like many others have said, we should've simply eaten that until full and then left.    The lady's ceviche was a huge portion, and said to be very good (didn't eat it), but the tortillas I did sample were overcooked, looking only slightly dark but tasting burnt.  My NY strip pizziaola - after being ordered as "tell the chef to aim for between Medium and Medium Rare" - arrived at barely even MR, but was tasty enough with all that garlicy marinara (*SLICES* of shaved garlic, like in Goodfellas!) that the extra juiciness was okay with me.  I used more of the appetizer bread to soak up the bloodiness.  Mmmmm aus juis  The other had a penne dish with chicken and mushrooms in a brown sauce.  This was said to be all just fine, but my keen eye saw the chicken going untouched and a few peices of penne being pushed around.  Probing proved that all was not just fine, since the chicken was quite dry, and the penne was so barely grasping to reach al dente doneness that she thought at first it might be whole wheat pasta (the dim lighting may have contributed also).  Service was 'eh'.  Yes, that's right.  It was so generic, by-the-book, make sure we cover all the requisite phrases and checking in moments -- but nothing more than that -- that I cannot even warrant the "M" to give them the entire 'meh'.    When inquiring if we'd like wine, and asked for Spumante, the server replied, "you mean Spumoni?!? We don't have that." We looked at each other.....I so badly wanted to ask "so, you don't have the wine, or you don't have the ice cream?"....but we both just gave a tentative "okaaaaaaay..."    Chose not to try getting any wine.   8^ |  There was nothing too horrible about the service, but nothing great either......  EXCEPT of course there was the fact that someone involved in making up the bill decided to _*help themselves*_ to a 20% gratuity when the coupon states that an 18% gratuity is included.  Even with the mediocre service, I would have added a personal table tip to the auto-gratuity, but I certainly did not do that once I saw the 20% on the bill. I also chose not to bring it up with the server, because it was obvious that they already knew that it was calculated at 20%, and I wasn't about to play the whole Pretend It Was An Error game. There was no mis-reading the coupon. There was no mistake in the math. It was *calculated* at exactly 20% with intention. So that's what they got from me.  Nothing else.  ...except this review.

My Freddy's Frozen Custard rating 2.5 had been *generously* rounded up to a 3, but no longer....I dropped 'em down.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/freddys-frozen-custard-and-steak-burgers-glendale#hrid:GvLhtxnxG9PaPbLWxNuq6w  I went to Culver's, basically.  Now I get what Freddy's is trying to be.  Although Freddy's has a mythology that  lays claim to being the originator of the burger style, Culver's just does it better.    They do everything better.  From friendly customer service, cleanliness, to the fresh and tasty food; and the thick yet crisp on the outside crinkle cut frys were simply a model of perfection on the delicate Greasy~Crispy Spectrum.  The burger?  Even though it was still in the take-two-patties-at-a-time thin style, each of these patties was about as thick as the two put together at Freddy's.   The flavor really proved that it was fresh, not frozen meat pre-grilling.  The meat was cooked all the way through, and yet still juicy.    http://www.yelp.com/biz/steakenburger-long-wongs-phoenix#hrid:K1GltivZImD5el_e8Qg2iA  The basic sundae automaticaly comes with 2 flavors of topping, so they aren't trying to unfairly skrimp you for skrilla left and right with extras.  Very cool, Culver's!   Boo Freddy's for being so lackluster with customer service, overseasoned with food, and generally failing.

I will never understand why places like Chipotle (even Taco Bell) who have all the food precooked, and all the server has to do is scoop it into a tortilla or dish and wrap it up, can still manage to work so slowly as to get their line backed up for 15 minutes with only a few people in it (as if I'm at a Subway)!   I am not at all prejudiced against hippydreadlock folk based on appearance, but the rasta chick happened to be the problem this night, since she was moving in slow motion like she was blazed off of her gourd.  I don't understand why I can get as much salsa as I want, on the side in a cup, with my burrito and there's no charge, but as soon as I order a bag of tortilla chips then i HAVE TO pay for that same cup of salsa.  Still good food when it's what you're in the mood for, but this particular Chipotle loses a star for gross incompetence.

Fans of the dramatic misfortunate adventures of RyanC read on...  WikiWiki, whose name creates instant old school rap flashbacks*, catered the recent Tiki Party PBR Concert featuring Fishbone and other cool local acts. The grilled meat smelled good (although when does grilled meat not) so I stepped up to their little table setup and surveyed a grill full of what looked like flattened chicken thighs and their menu sign which offered a limited selection from their regular menu:   $5 Chicken  $7 Beef Short Ribs or $7 Meat Combo  -all with white rice and macaroni salad.  I ordered the combo.  A few moments later I opened up the styrofoam clamshell the Young Male (YM) staffer handed me.  I'd gotten all rice,and there were in fact two small icecream scooper mounds of glutenous grain, but slapped on top of it was one small piece of chicken, perhaps one very small or half a large deboned thigh, and one small strip of short rib, which had less meat than a steroid-addict musclebound lunkhead's got in his roomy banana hammock.  I extended my hand holding the food back towards him and said "that's all I get?" Making no gesture towards grabbing the tray at all, he replies matter-of-factly, "that 's how much you get." After spending a few moments politely describing the larger portions I've seen everyone else sporting and asking for either more food or a discount, YM refuses. Another patron has arrived and is loose on PBR, so is standing way too close for my personal space comfort, but this means he's heard me and YM talking.  Let's call him Drunken Dirtbag (DDB).  Now, DDB is amused by all of this, but he's also hungry, so he asks YM to rustle him up a Chicken Plate with Mac and rice.  YM doesn't even hesitate, but instantly offers DDB my plate of food, saying "You want to buy this? He doesn't want it anymore so you can just pay him" I've been holding this food in my personal possession for over 5 minutes now, and although i never spit on it or anything, YM doesn't know that!  Is this even something allowed by health laws? DDB chuckles heartily but declines, saying he just wants the $5 chicken plate.  "Me too....now", I contribute. I explain to YM that I will just have to alleviate my feelings of being ripped off by causing him to lose some significant business.  I won't lie or make anything up, I'll just show anyone who steps up to order exactly how much food they can expect for their money, and then they can decide if it's worth it, instead of having to be surprised and disappointed like me. YM: "Go ahead."     Game on, this should be fun.  `,8^ )  Actually, it wasn't even working out that well, since more than half of those I showed still wanted to order, but I did get some sympathizers who joined my protest.  My friends were also supportive, letting me be, and checking back in on me after several minutes.  I was getting a little tired of holding onto my principals by this point, when OF, sorry that's the Older Female staffer from WikiWiki, came over with 7 single$ fanned out like a hand of cards, excitedly letting me know, "Okay, here.  You can go now.  Seven dollars. Here."  This was not her coming rushing in to save the situation, no, no.  This was a good 15 minutes after my initial order now.  This was her resigning herself to the fact that I wasn't going to go away, and the night was still young.  I smiled at her, turned around and set my tray on the table, giving YM a snarkily satisfied smirk, and went back to the festivities, proud and bully-ish feeling at the same time.  As far as the restaurant istelf, well, it is run by these grumpy stubborn, non-customer-service oriented folks, apparently so I'm never setting foot in the place, nor ever eating their overpriced, underwhelming food ever again.   *yes, my friend Eric and I really did break dance to that song in 5th and 6th grade. Jam on it...Jam on it...Jam, Ja-J-J-J-J-Jam on it!

China Star used to be my fave.  We're talking... I was there every 4-5 days for several months straight.  The cooks or owners moved from the sister location at 43rd and Bell, also a former Red Lobster building, I think, because suddenly that china boofay sucked and this one was my crispy-chewy happy double lucky place to be. I was well on my way from my usual paradoxically doughy, yet svelt, bod --looking like a mad scientist's genetic cross between David Spade and Vin Deisel -- rapidly growing towards the likes of my all-time china-boofay hero, John Pinette.   And then, in true "YOU BEEN HEAH FO' OWAH ! " Pinette-ish fashion, I came to know the wrath of Sam (probably not his real name).  This manager or whatever he is just does not like me, all my repeated business over the months be damned! I guess he caught on to my (and many other's) idea that we could show up at a buffett around the end of the Lunch period and before the start of the Dinner period, and pay the lunch price for a first round of lunch foods, and then all of your seconds, thirds , eighths,  are chosen from the newly put out dinner dishes.  Did I mention I was cheap?  Okay.  So Sam did not like the whole idea of this, and I'm not sure what kind of back-kitchen meetings they held about revenue-generating ideas, but they came up with a plan to stop it.  So even though Lunch is posted on their sign, door, printed menus, etc, as ending at 4:00pm, when Dinner begins, they started to charge the Dinner price at 3:45pm.    Pblllttpppbbbllltt!! {sound of a 'rasberry', for the onomotopeiaically challenged}    Mind you they do not even begin to put out the new Dinner items until around five minutes after 4 o'clock.  When I protested, and mentioned that I don't even eat seafood, which makes up the bulk of the new dishes put out for the Dinner menu, Sam does not care, and gets angry when I point out that the printed menu and sign say 4:00pm. Due to the line of customers waiting behind me to pay, Sam quiets his obvious anger and says it okay this time, we pay Lunch price but we only get 20 minutes to eat and then we have to be done, and he's going to check to make sure no Dinner items are on our plates!!!!! This really ticks me off, and I turn into Mr. Angry Customer/  Like Mr Furious from Mystery Men, my super power is to get really, really mad, but I've vowed only to use my powers for the Consumer Good. I begin spouting about all the business I've brought this place and how I'm going to contact the attorney general's office and have them come in and do some sort of consumer pricing audit, or something like that.   As usual, this technique only results in everyone in the lobby -- Sam, the other customers, my wife -- thinking that I'm a complete lunatic.  So instead of my intended desire of having my protest elicit a mob-mentality massive walkout or sitdown or picket line or some other such psuedo-political nonsense, all I succeed in doing is embarrass my wife and make the line of customers behind me all-the-more anxious to step up and pay their hard earned plastic; at whatever price: they don't even care. (I wasn't just Mr Angry Customer, though, since I really did go online and send a note to the AG's office, and they sent back a form letter saying, well, basically, nothing at all.)  I hope that other consumers out there will join me in refusing to put up with BS like this when we encounter it.  Sam, I've got a dollar store digital wrist watch here for ya.  My present, from me to you.  I've set the time 15 minutes ahead, so you can point to it with exaggerated gestures when you argue with customers about how much they have to pay at what time.  No, that's okay, I can afford it.  I went down the street and paid the lunch price for my china boofay instead of your inflated 'Linner' price.  [food still worth 3.5 stars]

Okay, so after reading a super hilarious recent spiel about the personal trainer and the Yelp Menace in Cali, I reread my review and decided that even if I don't want to patronize this establishment anymore, I want my review to be fair (and I don't want to be listed as a menace, now, do I). So since I rated the service a 1 and the food a 3.5, I think a 2 is a more appropriate overall score than my original 1. I forced myself to eat lunch there one more time to confirm that the food is tasty enough to warrant this adjustment, and it is.  I went around 2:00pm-ish to avoid trouble, and no, I did not bring Sam the watch.

Poli is a little different than some of the other ~bertos places, with a bit of variety in the menu and a bunch of quality in the food. The place is clean and the booths are quite cushy and comfortable. It was good, but fuhDANGah i can't be loose enough to give 'em more than a 4.0  The Carnitas taco was great.  (that's pork for the gringos and recent transplants) It came in full size, not tiny, soft corn tortillas, with roasted pork chunks covered in a drizzle of "guac-like sauce / saucy guac" and some pico de gallo.  The pork was standout - tasty and tender and not dry at all.  The Pollo (chicken, Guero!) taco was good, as well, but not the best I've had.  Shredded chicken was moist, sure, but this stuff is always precooked and waiting in a watery broth to be tong'd out into a waiting shell, so not too hard to be decent.  Poli's was average to good in the meat, generous with lettuce and cheese, but the hard corn shell was not the right consistency and crumbled into my hand as i ate.  There was a Carne Asade Nacho (grilled meat and chips, Pan Blanco!) plate that was about a foot in diameter and about a third as high.  It looked impressive, but the meaty bit I sampled had a wierd taste -- good at first, but then almost 'fishy' later.  Who knows. 8^ |  NQI Napkin Quality Index : poor, not the worst i've encountered, but only a 2 star napkin experience, as best.  I will be making more return visits, but this does not earn the title of the best hole in the wall mexican joint from me.  (A title a Somethingberto's near you is wishing hard that they had!)

Holy cow.   I could be a Hindu if only the method of worshipping was eating the object of worship. (which I guess makes my true natural religion Vulvan, but that's another story)   `,8^ }  The Half Priced, Half Kobe, Half Chuck, Happy Hour Daily Dose Burger was Wholly delicious.   The pretzel-bread bun just took it over the top.  The rest of the menu looked thoughtfully prepared, and a brief conversation with one of the principals confirmed the serious attitude with which they take their establishment.  The staff handling our patio party was to be heartily commended.  The server was actually remembering and calling most everyone at the table by their first name! The empty plates and beer bottles never lingered long, and the cucumber slice infused (i'll never enjoy lemon-water quite as much again, this stuff was so refreshing!) water glasses were never empty.  Perhaps the wonderful company of multiple yelpers and the genuine conversation had me in a bit of an in-clover stupor, but I left Daily Dose with a feeling of fulfillment that went far beyond my belly.  Special thanks Donald for the set-up, and Carin's parents for being so hip and cool!

Grady and Carol were super friendly creating a downright homestyle, accomodating atmosphere. Just like the food. My brother and I split and shared the pulled pork and the bbq brisket sandwiches.  Both were delicious, but my personal taste preferred the smoky pork.  There are other choices written on the wall, with pictures that make it all look just as good as what I sampled. There are three choices of sauce - Mild, Hot, and Super Hot (which really is!) I thought Hot was near perfect, but did ask for a sample side of Super Hot, which was nice in small amounts, and great mixed with kethcup for the salty and very hot fries. There are cold sides like macaroni and potato salads, etc, and the peach cobbler looked good, but we didn't have it today.  Yelpers should be very impressed that once he saw Daren, Grady got all excited about having him try his new variation on the potato salad, since he'd read Daren's Yelp saying that the sides may be a little lacking, and he knew just what was missing and had spiced the dish right up.  Daren confirmed that this batch was quite good and that the things he thought weren't right last time were good now. Grady was very pleased with himself, and Daren enjoyed the taste, but ironically it was the last of the batch and he had to have fries instead!  The storefront is in a strip mall that, although a little run down, is nestled nearby a portion of Phoenix Mountain Preserve which beautifies the background.   2 tables and about 5 chairs fill the sit-down portion of the lobby, but with this weather coming right now it shoud be on your list of picnic and reunion weekend get togethers for pickup of catering style takeout.  Plus I see a very cramped episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives in their future.  See you next time Grady and Carol!!  PS: I can't think of any specific thing that makes this only 4 stars instead of 5 except that I just know that it will give me an opportunity (excuse) to try more things right away and bump it up to a 5 soon!

Third visit, and she calls me by name upon walking in the door!  I made it by for dinner Saturday after trying several times on a Sunday (they get a day off, too y'know)  Delicious as usual.  I notice on the menu boards that they are now offering quite a selection.  Besides BBQ brisket, pork, chicken, 1/4 or half chicken, wings, ribs, and all the fixin's, they now also offer a bunch of seafood options like fried catfish, etc.  I got a tshirt: "I [heart] Grady's BBQ Sauce"

Oh, and it's so clean in their kitchen, I'd be willing to eat off of the floor near the baseboard behind the prep table. No kidding, I've seen it.  Aside from that the kitchen was intoxicating me with a smorgas~copia of aromas.   Daren suggested setting up a Special Chef's Table in the narrow hallway, which I heartily agreed with.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a9JpaxYER0

I'll be sad that I can't stop in to my local neighborhood storefront for the best BBQ in phoenix,   but I'll get over that since I can go down to the Downtown Farmer's Market every weekend for a fix.  I'm downright inconsolable about not being able to see as much of my two friends, Grady and Carolyn.  8,^ (  Viva Grady's      http://www.yelp.com/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%   .

A little patio with a little waterfall and little birds flitting about. A little bit different than your average local mexican, since it's NEW mexican style. A little bit of $ for a little more food than I could eat at once. A lot is how much I like Gil's food and service. A lot is how much effort the proprietor seems to have put into creating a unique, quaint, homey, and comforting menu and atmosphere. A lot is how much effort you should put into finding this little gem.

I dig this popped corn.  The actual store I didn't go to, but someone brought a big bag full of smaller sample bags in to work after eating at the Cult of the Chinese Pandero.   (   http://www.yelp.com/biz/chino-bandido-phoenix-3#hrid:hi2081NhaaPybV3CXKdgeg   )  Whoever comes up with all the flavors must be like James Brown:  "I don't know karate, but I do know Cah-razy!" See DarenC's nice list below of all(?) the flavors they have.  I had Backyard BBQ and Cheesy Chipotle.  Imagine an ideal of what those flavors must taste like and that's what it taste like.  Great flavor.  I don't know the prices, so I can't use my harsh, judgmental, sliding scale like I did for Sprinkles (  http://www.yelp.com/biz/sprinkles-cupcakes-scottsdale#hrid:eG2YCPUzmLY0pO09huS-MQ  ), but I know it has to be premium.  The difference is that my sample of Poppa Maize actually lived up to high expectations.  I'm going to risk seeming like the greedy co-worker and go back for another.  Sure I've had my share, but most everyone has left and there's plenty still there and I want to see if there's one of the sweet flavors left for dessert!   ("I was told that I would receive a piece, and last time I did not recieve a peice.....") I can always say the nighttime cleaning crew must've helped themselves.

Luci's is like one of those annoying "slash" bands; you know, rock/ska/gregorian chant/fusion kind of thing.  Even if there's something you like, there's all that other stuff to contend with. This place is a slick bastard child Mini-Me of a Trader Joe's meets Fresh & Easy meets Starbuck's meets CircleK, etc,etc,etc. Think of an item you can buy at one of those stores, add 50-100% to the price, reduce the selection to usually only one (or very few) choice(s), and voila!    ~ Luci's. Everywhere I looked I saw something I liked, tempered with something that made me take a step back.  Usually it was price.  Second most often it was selection. ...then I got to the case with meats and cheeses and found prepackaged (excessively packaged,btw, way to be NOT green) slices of proscuitto or something similar that were way out of date - 6 days past the printed USE BY (not sell by) date.  For a store this small, to have more than a half dozen of these packages out in prominent view is not okay.  At least pull a F&E and let the clearance hounds take them for a bargain when they're about to be past due, but don't just keep trying to sell them for full price. They make some fresh lemonade and teas, then put them into individual 20 oz/32 oz plastic cups and leave them in the fridge case.  Fine during a lunch hour rush, but for me to have seen a full case of 'em at 9pm-ish meant they were about to throw it all away (either that or save it for the next day?).  This is not only wasteful of food and plastic packaging, but also drives their costs up. This feels like an expensive imitation of the real deal, like an "authentic" NY deli or St Louis BBQ being dropped into Kierland Commons by  PepsiCo/KFC/PizzaHut/TacoBell, or when a Vintage (glorified thrift) shop opens up in an artsyfartsy or ritzy area and starts charging Vintage prices for stuff they got at Goodwill's 50% off sale the week before. Although I'm sure that's not where Luci's in getting their food.  It might not be $6.99 for a $2.99 box of cereal if they were.

Luci's can leap from Two Stars to Four, in a single visit!  Jaek and I recently hung out at a table in the open garage-door, inside patio type area of Luci's, and we both had a great time. (see photos)  A big reason for this was the friendly and helpful demeanor of Braden, a barista/juicista/pastryista behind the counter. After eyeballing a red velvet cake slice with cream cheese frosting dolloped up on top that actually had *GLITTER* covering it, I asked how they made edible glitter, or if those were just for show. He explained about pulverized polished sugar, and after I shared that I have a bonified, legit case of picaphobia (glitter - it's little tiny sharp edged peices of metal or hard plastic, you know, with a mind of it's own, an inability to wash off, a tendency to get men in trouble for indiscretions at the boobiebar, and a seeming ability to reproduce.  I think it may be alive and evil, actually), and that I was taking a huge psychological step in overcoming it by having decided that I was going to get one of those slices and actually eat my psyche's penultimate nemesis, he congratulated me and said that it was on him.    Well, since he comped that glittercake, I felt allright splurging for a tasty, but still overpriced, big glass of fresh squeezed OJ.  I tried, but couldn't find a single expired meat or cheese item in the fridge case.  I still say it's a weird conglomeration, and a bit pricey, but if I was a local without a car, being able to walk here every couple days would be wonderful.  Oh yeah, the fine folks at Luci's have put up a nice plaque thanking the local firefighters who saved their place from destruction during Richardson's recent burn.

I call it Central Avenue Hiking Trail.  I've heard folks call this the Bridle Path, but there are a lot more running shoes and strollers than riding boots and saddles. NOBODY says Murphy Bridle Path, except maybe some grisly old dudes munching stogies and kicking out women at Phx Country Club.  "there are no brides either so all the times you see it referred to as Bridal Path is wrong. " Artur C.   ell oh ell 8^ D  I really love this path.  I like going out into wilderness more than strolling through the city's center, but THERE'S SHADE ON THIS TRAIL !!!   Yea! If you were to go all heat stroke it wouldn't take a helicopter to extract you!   Yea! Lots of friendly people of various hobbies and fitness levels, and a Boy Scout troop (I cannot recall the name of to give credit to) has even continued to supply the doggie mitt boxes with real pick-up bags, even though the city of Phoenix has stopped supplying them to all of the dog parks. At the north end of the path, you are a little south of Dunlap ave, near Corbin's and Bombero's, and at a crossroads with the Trail going along the Canal.  You can park in the lot at Senior Villa Mexican Restaurant [*Edit: Formerly this mexican rest, but now the new Central Grille at 8525 N Central*].  If you want to start further south, then there are plenty of churches where you can prob park, but this restaurant is not open in the early part of the day, so even on weekends, this is a nice place to park.   Lock up!  Despite your surroundings, and those even more posh further to the south, you are only a 5 minute walk from downtown Sunnyslope.  On the southwest side of the canal, there's a house with it's back wall bordering the canal path.  The folks here have built a few Guard Towers for their little dog, and s/he gets to runs up the steps to see over the wall and bark at whomever is going by.  NEAT and FUN for that dog, but was a little distracting to my dogs, who wanted to eat that yappy little....) Only trouble I had:  once you're down the road a bit further south on Central, you are moving past various houses, estates, and condominiums, and are no longer near any of those restaurants up near Dunlap, however there is a distinct odor of DIRTY SPENT FRYER GREASE all up and down the path.  I wonder if the city sprays a petroleum product on the unpaved path to keep dust down?  I hope not; they did that on my street as a kid in Detroit, and anyone who walked on it barefoot got blisters, cracking, and peeling skin.  Blech!  Even if I lived near here, I'd rather have the dust, and I don't want that on my dogs feet, either. One reason I'd use this path in the summer is that with all the nice sized shade trees, you don't need to get your dog booties.   Pick up after your dogs.  What's with the people who tie it up in a baggie, but then leave the baggie?

If you're old enough to remember service stations that weren't just gas stations, where you checked your oil and tires at the same time you filled'er up, then this place will bring you back.  Maybe not to the service stations of the 1950's, but maybe the 80's or so, before the invention and proliferation of "Git It Cho Damn Self" gasoline. In addition to the ubiquitous self serve pumps and C-store, they also have service bays where you can get your oil changed or other such mechanical tomfoolery.  I haven't gotten service or checked their prices, though.  As far as gas, you can pump it yourself, sure, but they are using the old school method of charging more for credit than for cash, so be careful of the price. [Using a Valero/DiamondShamrock gas card gets you the cash price, though]  Nice thing is they don't try to scam you by advertising the cash price then upping it at the pump if you pay credit; they advertise the credit price, and you get the awesome feeling of getting a nice little discount when you see the cash/gas card price!  My cherry on top is that you aren't going to be charged $.50, $.75, or even $1.00 for use of the air compressor, like other gas stations nowadays.  The island nearer to the building actually has TWO (2) air pump hoses built right into the side of the island's little wall, one right next to each gas pump!

La Mirage Mediterranean occupies a wierd pad in NoPho's Bell Canyon Pavillions Shoppping Center, at I-17 north of Bell -- the room's kind of shaped like a big wedge of cheese.  But it's fresh and tidy inside, with twangy M.E. music and an owner-looking guy with slicked back hair sitting in a back office while a couple of women were out front serving customers.    Compared with other M.E. places I've been, the food was really good, but a good , tasty, quality stand-ard, not stand-out.  Considering that other nearby choices start with "Native New...",   "Hometown...",   "Apple...",   "Hoot...", et al., this is really a great option to have available.  I also had the Lunch Special::: sammie, side, and drink for $5.99.  You choose any pita-wrapped sandwich, from among about a dozen different meaty or veggie selections, including chicken or beef shawarma, tika, kabob, falafel, hummous, etc.  You can have a soup, house salad or fries, or for a $buck extra get a Tabhouli Salad, that I found really tasty, lemony and not too oily, larger than expected, with lots of tomato bits mixed in, and bulgar wheat bits that were closer to soggy grape nuts than chewy couscous.  After a few initial weird bites, I eventually decided the texture was really nice, and I'm a fan of it now, over the more common pasta-y bits.  Mixed it into my Falafel sandwich, which was really good, but not the best I've had, just really good (there will never be another *ORIGINAL* Yusef's, which is my gold standard, well, really they were green!)  They have a stage and do entertainment here as well, with a website to consult for special event dates.  I've driven past this place pretty late on a Saturday and seen it hopping.   For some reason they have a DJ'd Latin Dance night once a week, I think every Tuesday.(?!?)   Overall really nice place I'll be back to, for sure.  Maybe not for the live music, but mos def for the awesome Lunch Special.

I attempted Lin's, to be honest, but it was inhumanely packed, had too long of a line, and was highly priced.  I went with 80% as good for 50% the price and came here.  I think I made a fine decision.  Rand is the GRand Boofay Master, and I can add very little to his well-written review.   Everything he says about New Great China is true:  The food is pretty darned good. The booth was uncomfortable. It deserves to survive amidst nearly insurmountable competition. The server was really cute.

Boo for Chick-fil-A closing the Ghettrocenter location, which was closer, but yea for this location for being so much closer than Arrowhead.  Come to think of it, this location was quicker and more efficient than Arrowhead, resulting in hotter, fresher food.  Yea for Deer Valley Chick-fil-A. My lunch hour drive thru order was ready before I was with the cash, meaning the chicken's precooked, but they still had to slap it together, since I got the lettuce and tomato.  All the food was fresh; nice generous portion of green leaf lettuce, good-as-can-be-expected tomato (2 slices), and the waffle fries were in the exact correct place on the delicate Greasy-Crispy Spectrum.  The two clerks I interacted with were friendly and it even seemed genuine.  Sure Chick-fil-A is not as cheap as other fast food choices, but it's so much better feeling the clear juice of a real chicken breast run down your hand than the mucky slippery oil from a chopped & formed chicken 'patty' that a lot of places have. (Exactly what part of the chicken is the 'patty', anyway?)  Churchies own all their places, so they are oh so annoyingly closed on Sundays as a rule.  But the food is so good that any effort to protest them by not going the rest of the week would be short-lived.  Now if they ever started in-store proselytizing, that'd be a different story, but they've never done that, far as I can tell.  When I go in, I get the Ice Dream; exactly what part of the cow that is, I do not know, but it's sad to think they get those cows' hopes up by making them stooges for their "EAT MORE CHIKN" mock-protest marketing campaign, only to steal their dreams from them one way or another, and freeze them up for a tasty frozen dessert.  I picture a dark and gloomy torture room, probably the basement of one of their churches, where cows are strapped up and sucked of their dreams,  like the hapless folk from the Dark Crystal having their 'essence' drained by the Skeksies.  Or maybe that's how they get the fresh lemonade?

Utterly superb customer service!  There must be at least 47 employees buzzing around like bees.  I was startled by an offer to "help you right here sir!" only seconds after entering the front door, before my eyes had even adjusted to the change in light.  Awesome menu offerings and wide selection of choices.+ Fresh not frozen burgers with lots of customization available. + Tasty desserts = Great American Fast Food

Had an interesting breakfast today, since my Shanghai Boofay lunch was so early.   MikeC, NormR, RandH, DarenC, and I met up at the place which has recently opened in the carcass of the former original location of China Star Boofay, in the carcass of a former Red Lobster, near 43rd Ave and Bell Rd in North Phoenix. So since there will soon be several thorough reviews from notable Yelpilluminati, I will stick to those areas that are uniquely mine:  Greasy~Crispy Spectrum: .-. 4 stars .-.  nothing was too soggy at all, and there was a crispy outside on very many dishes.  Bonus that the terryaki chicken appeared not to have been deep fried but perhaps baked.  Discard Pile: .-. 4 stars .-.  i had very little to cut off or spit out (thinking even of the short ribs) and most dishes actually had absolutely zero Discard Pile.  Notable were both the honey and orange chicken, and a nice crisped-up outside on the wontons.  McKenna Novelty Factor: .-. 5 stars .-. (here's another category, newly named, for how i judge a boofay, whether it's got the 'same old same old' or it has unique items that you can't get just anywhere)  Shanghai had several items that were pretty novel.  Scoop-it-yer-damn-self Thrifty ice cream in about 8 different flavors.  Sushi bar that included seaweed salad and other acoutrements.  Also of note was what Norm said was called a Dessert Soup, which had a yellowish syrupy looking liquid with a small amount of blanched peanuts and red grapes floating in it, along with what at first apeared to be bits of tripe, like in menudo! Norm later figured out that it was ceylon agar (just think of it as vegan gelatin - it's from seaweed!), and with the server's help, that the small round fruits that looked like small apricots or orange lychee, were in fact a chinese fruit called loquat, we supposed related to the cumquat, every gradeschool boy's favorite thing to call someone as a name, since it's a real fuit and how can you get in trouble for that?  RyanC-isms: .-. 3 stars .-.  A few personal favorites were missing, such as bean sprouts and a General tsao-type chicken (the spicy chicken they had wasn't spicy at all, and was mostly jalapeno flavored).  I also wish I could have put some chocolate syrup on my ice cream.  The lone bowl of rainbow sprinkles made me wish for more of a sundae bar, although MikeC seemed to be doing very nicely with the cone(s)!   $7-something for lunch is just allright since it doesn't include the drink.   The decor is comfortable and clean.  The service was excellent, with plates cleared quickly, and friendliness all around.   The nice ladies found answers to our questions and even took our picture, too!

My first review is a year old now, and I'm still eating at Shanghai Buffett 3-4 times a month for lunch.  I'm a big fan.  Norm R's right, they deserve the 5th star.  (not that they're a ritzy place, but to judge each establishment against only it's own category, this is really the best of the large chinese buffets in north phoenix)  Michael K makes a great point about the friendliness of the service.  90% of the staff is very smiley and friendly, and also extremely Service-Oriented.  This is a rare quality, in this rushed world where so many clerks and servers seem to be simply 'phoning it in'.  Your dirty plates will disappear and your drinks will seem to refill themselves.  Variety and freshness are simply what I've come to expect from Shanghai.

Some yelpers get on the "no chain restaurants" idealistic bandwagon, which is a worthy cause, if not taken to an extreme form of foodier-than-thou pretension. However, there seems to be a lack of acknowledgment that the lowly, oft-forlorned, buffet and other Chinese restaurants are almost always independently, family-owned and run, local businesses.   Seeing the same employees everyday, obviously working 12+ hour shifts, sometimes with their children sitting in a booth doing school work, is the epitome of the local indie ideal. They are making a small profit margin , too (otherwise they might upgrade the interior amenities more often), so cut them some slack and if you know you don't like a buffet format, then don't go to one and give a bad review because a chef didn't plop your steaming hot dish from his pan to your plate, or because someone brought their grubby children for a bargain priced night out.  Shanghai is still one of tastiest buffets in north phoenix.  The food is very good , judging against other restaurants of it's kind, of course, this is a qualified 5 stars. One cannot go in expecting fine dining atmosphere and expect to pay less than $10 for their meal if one is of sound mind.  I'm not sure what some reviewers expect when they start their comments off with a phrase like "i dont even like buffets" and then proceed to rip a place apart because other people were touching the serving spoons! I wish I was an owner here. I'd make no effort to kiss the butt of the customers trying to walk all over me.  ( The staff is very friendly to regulars, as well as angelicaly patient with grumpy, demanding, difficult customers.  )  I'd tell them to take their pretentious, trying-not-to-pay $80 butt and gtfo.  Criticisms of the place being old are warranted, and there is a lack of cold salad greens. The latter is made up for with some delicious veggie dishes of bok choy, green beans, broccoli, and/or spinach hot dishes. There are slower days, and especially slower times of day when you may not see many customers  and the food may replenish a little slower. When the Friday night or Saturday afternoon rush is on though, both the restaurant and crowd of customers seem to gell into a single well oiled machine.  PS There are almost always coupons available from Val pak, Clipper, etc.

Tasty House has 4 reviews -- two of which have been chosen as ROTD on separate occasions.  They may have gotten lucky with the infamous yelp algorithm, but they really do deserve it.  4.5 stars   ( even for a Hole-In-The-Strip-Mall )  The quality, portion, and price all combine together in a trifecta of value.  They are really friendly, ingredients are always fresh, and the food really is tasty!  Fried/Steamed dumplings is a new favorite.  They are thicker and more doughy, like dim sum -- and delicious!

I'm fi'in to be back soon.  Oh yea.  It won't matter what you get it on, as long as you get the breading.    The breading.   !!    Somehow this stuff defies the laws of physics and packs more good stuff into its thin, crispy layers than should be able to fit.  !!  I had a Pork Chop Sandwhich with fries for $6.50, and the chop was HEE-UGE.  You can get catfish, chicken, whatever.  Get something breaded.   (!!)  I'm sure the ribs are great, but they don't have them breaded, so forget it.  (Just kidding - I wanted ribs, but they weren't ready yet. "He won't serve them until they're tender enough," said the server, of the chef.)  I also overheard a neat conversation about how they wanted to be sure to be able to advertise "GREEN", and that, among other things to that effect, all of the interior decorating -- chairs, tables, wainscotting, etc -- was recycled.   Fabulous.  Do they come breaded?

Disclaimer and Qualifications: I'm a midwestern gringo, but I've been here 20+ years, so can take a little heat.  My wife is half Thai, and her Mom and Aunts used to sit around prepping, cooking REAL ACTUAL Thai food (and gossiping) all day long, so she knows the good stuff.  The first time we went, she loved it so much that the second time we went and got a TOGO order, we brought home over $75 worth of food for her, I, and a 12 yo girl.  This doesn't mean three $25 meals, either,  since each entree/appetizer ranges from a little under to a little over $10.  Yea, leftovers!  Instructions: 1.  Hire a group of thugs to tie you up, slip a sack over your mousse-head, toss you in the back of a cargo van, and dump your pretentious, elitist butt INSIDE the front doors of Siam.  2.  Enjoy the tastiest, most authentically prepared and flavored Thai food you'll likely have this side of Bangok, served by friendly authentically prepared and flavored Thai folk, in a very clean and ornately decorated, authentically prepared and flavored environment.  3. Go through moral, ethical, and spiritual crisis as you decide whether it is time to forgoe your judgemental, plastic-coated, dream world where everything is pristine and sanitized, so that you may indulge in the tastes of the real world, not the Real World tm.  4. Decide that you simply cannot face the ugly Glendale strip mall you know is outside those doors; have thugs kidnap you back to East Valley and drop you off at Kierland Commons, so that you can wash away the filthy feeling with an overpriced gourmet coffee amongst the beautiful people.  Pretend you didn't just start down the dark path of heroin-like spicy Thai basil & peppers.  Pretend that you won't be slinking back to the other side of the tracks to cop another score sooner than you think.  Look around at all of the fronts -- on the stores, and especially the people -- they want you to believe that they are authentically prepared and flavored, but they aren't.

Bonjour Mes Amis   Dit mon la verite'! 5 stars?!?  Ca c'est bon   Lafitte's seems to be one of the nicest restaurants in the area, and still quite affordable, considering what you get for your money.  (and this from a bonifide cheapskate)   It was also nearly empty for Sunday dinner, but I'm sure that is something that varies greatly seasonally. Lafitte's is hidden inside of the Embassy Fountain Suites Hotel s.e. corner of I-17 and Greenway Rd, and is a little cajun/creole restaurant that really is a Lagniappe!   The menu was quite large and much more varied than I thought it would be. (not all seafood)  Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are served.  Gumbo, Jambalaya, soup, Po'Boy and a bunch of other sandwiches, salads, pizza, entrees from pasta and veggies to fillet, ribs, prime rib, and more scrimps than you, Capt. Dan (and Bubba, en spirit) could ever get from a night out on the Jenny in the bayou.   The baby back ribs had both a dry rub and a sauce glazed on while grilling ~sweet, spicy (could've been a tad hotter), tender and meaty and moist.   The prime rib came in a slab worthy of Fred Flintstones dinner plate. The large portion was seriously somewhere between two and three inches thick, and the portion and it's demi-glace filled HALF of the plate, shoving the colorful mixed veggies to one side, and the side order of chicken and sausage jambalaya -- luckily in it's own little cup -- was moved onto the table to accommodate meat-slab-slicing-room.  The beef was cooked perfectly to order (MR for me, R for pop), tender, flavorful with or without the sauce, and just the right amount of fattiness.  Let us return to that jambalaya. WHEW BOYEE, it was a delicious dark gravy stew over rice that easily could be a satisfying meal on its own! C'est magnifique, I gau-RUN-tee!   There were two different scrimps dishes at the table as well, which both must have been really good, because neither the saucy one or the pasta-ey one got shared with anyone!   There is a tasty although probably over-hyped ice cream dish on the desert menu that seems like some sort of cake but is really just a big slab of Neapolitan ice cream with a tiny bit of meringue on the outside.   Service was superb! Our server was lively, attentive, funny, and really nice. She was knowledgeable about the dishes, offered recommendations when asked (even a bit of a Miracle on 34th Street-ish: "I'd get one of the other sides, not because the sweet potato fries are bad, they're just average, and so many of the other sides you'd be missing are so good"), and was also familiar with the details (and made sure we were, too) of the restaurant.com coupon.   The restaurant.com coupon was what really made this a smokin' deal, and I heard from a coworker that they have a BOGO in the Entertainment book ,too. Even without the deals, the menu is really not very expensive considering the quality and portion size that you get at Lafitte's. 4 out of 5 dinner entrees were all $16, with many choices on either side of that average. Lunch sammies complete with side of fries or ? are around $8-9. The ice cream conglomeration fed all 5 of us for $8. Not bad 'tall, mon cheri.   Laisser les bons temps rouler !

¿Qué más se puede pedir?   This is what 5 stars is all about,  and yes, I'm doing it after only one visit.   ONLY?!? This one visit was a near perfect restaurant experience.   ¿Qué más se puede pedir?  This is another of my favorite combination of a grungy, old strip mall hiding an absolute gem of an independently-owned eatery.   Kind of like a geode in restaurant form.   EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE  is a great place to start. All I was doing was minding my own biddness, reading the menu posted in the front window as I strolled by.  (Maybe I was going to the tattoo shop, maybe trails, maybe 7-11, maybe cheba hut, who knows? (oh, yeah - me, but who's saying?(i could, but that's not important right now.)))   As I began to get a feel for the menu, but still not quite sure if i'd venture in, Raul opens the door and warmly welcomes me inside. Vocalizations of reluctance are futile, as he insists that I sit inside and cool off, even if just to read the menu, which he places in front of me and offers to answer any questions. He's away and back in a flash with a tiny dish of toasted corn (pic), which he proudly declares is what they give in restaurants in Peru instead of chips and salsa. Along with it, he added a sample of what he called Peruvian 'lemonade', which was actually passionfruit juice -- FRESH juice, with tiny, weird, soft seeds floating in it, and everything!   Of course, I was hooked, and he knew it. I ordered a full glass as i munched my salted feeder-corn-looking appetizer and selected from the menu full of great descriptions of the dishes, and even several photos to help a gringo like me.   ¿Qué más quieres?  EXCELLENT FRESH FOOD  Okay, they've got that in Peru, apparently, and brought some here for us! There are a variety of 'regular' mexican items, but flip that menu over and find another page full of Comida Peruana. A multitude of ways to get your fish, chicken, beef, shrimp, squid, octopus, egg, beef heart, corn, veggies, yucca root, plantain, and spices.   quieres más? Seco de Cabrito? (goat stew?) sorry.......  only on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.   My Lomo Saltido(pic) had beef, chicken, rice, onions, tomatoes, and HOME FRIES mixed with cilantro and other spices to make a tiny amount of an au jus like gravy on the bottom of the plate, which i made sure flavored every bite that got into my mouth. Not greasy at all. Yes, there were chunks of fried potato that really were basically home fries mixed in, and yes, it was absolutely delicious.    I did not even use the two salsas that were offered -- i didn't need them -- but watchout! the samples i had were zoomin' hot. Even the milder green was fiery, but the orange (habanero-tinged?) hotter one was out of my tolerance range!   es que todo?  NO! Although the hole-in-the-strip-mall setting will turn a few folks away before even getting to the door, "Peruvian Corner" has really put some effort into making the inside inviting and clean. They've used stone and tile and vibrant paint to create an environment a half-step up from the typical stripmall pad turned restaurant.(pic)   Ahora estoy contento, VAMOS!

So far, the Pink Pepper 5 stars have carried over, but I'm nervous...  I asked the server, "So, even though there's new ownership, you won't be changing the recipes, right?"  To which she replied, "Oh, NO! No, no, no.  We won't change anything; we'll just make it more AUTHENTIC."  Wes, Daren, and I glanced at each other, exchanging a telepathic,  "Uh huh.  What the hell does that mean?  Are you changing or not?!", but we all just smiled back.     We'd just enjoyed a tasty and satisfying lunch boofay with a smorgasbord of choices for under $9, after all.  Tons of dishes full of exotic flavored veggies, meats, seafood, and sides -- even a few desserts.   I enjoyed Thai custard with apple slices quite a lot.  MMMMMM I want another piece.  Having seen more of the team than most yelpers, I can confirm that the super friendly and attentive staff seems to remain the same so far.  I didn't see any new faces, but there were several new dishes added to the usual weekday lunch boofay.  Thai toast was weird but good, with its syrupy, cucumber and red onion dipping sauce.  As long as they know enough to not change everything that already works so well, the new ownership should enjoy success, including a hefty lunch crowd, with me in it a few days a month, at least!

A burger with whatever-the-hell-you-want on it for no extra charges for things like jalapeno, grilled onions or peppers,etc sounds like a smokin deal.  $5 for that burger alone, with no combo deals in sight, brings you back down to earth.  The beef is high quality, with no grissly bits, and the toppings choices are many with plentiful, almost too much, volume.  Makes for a deliciously sloppy affair to eat a burger that is just as tall as it is wide!  I was worried when I unwrapped my tinfoil and saw that the bun had been pretty much smashed down during assembly.  I looked around and it was standard operating procedure, so I dug in, and the bun held up surprisingly well for being so pushed to its limits of moisture absorbtion and weight support.  Salt peanuts! Salt peanuts!  free for the taking.  They are everywhere -- something to be aware of if you have one of those allergic kids that they shut down school for when a classmate opens a PBJ sandwich too close. I also worried about their storage technique for the sacks of potatoes.  Either they are wasting hundreds of pounds of spuds, or they plan on using these after storing them out where any kid could poke their grubby little fingers into holes in the sacks, or stab the potatoes with a pen, or punch and bruise them, etc.  Prices are high, but I dig Five Guys B&F.  You seem to get what you pay for, except for the drink -- $2.19 for a 32 oz is just gouging.

Perfectly adequate as a gas and convenience store frequented by neighborhood commuters and students from the nearby high school.  It's a little dirty, and they recently removed those neat advertising TVs from the pumps, so pumping gas is less entertaining here than it used to be.  but here's the thing....  Pump N Munch is a *superbly clever* name for a gas station / convenience store!  Bravo on that, if it's their own, novel idea. (shmoogle shows another store in Lansing, Michigan with that same name -- since i'm too lazy to investigate further, it becomes a chicken and egg paradox, as to who had it first or whether they're related in any way)  However, having the slogan on your employees' tshirts be such a stolen and uninspired piece of drivel as "What Happens at Pump N Much Stays at Pump N Munch" is simply inexcusable.    C'mon, that's the best you could do?  It might as well say "Got Gas?" on the other side.    (I bet if they see this, they'll say, "Great idea!" and print those tshirts up, pronto)  Hmmm, the one in Lansing, MI is even called "Dick's Pump & Munch", so I'm going to have to give them the benefit of the doubt.  I'm not even sure I could do any better, but let's try:::::::  I don't know, maybe, "Pump N Munch - Satisfying ALL Your Cravings"  "Your Neighborhood *Service* Station winkwink"  Or how about something like, "in a recent customer poll, most men prefer to Munch, then Pump, while most women prefer no Pumping at all"  Addendum _ This place charges a premium price to buy gas on credit or even your debit card.  This is sadly more common lately, but at least at the Valero's they waive the extra fee if you use their own gas station charge card.  Even using a Shell card, PnM doesn't give you the cash discount.  Big Fail since that means I'll not be buying gas here unless it's some dire emergency. Here's one, "Pump N Munch - Getting Our Dirty Hands in Your Pockets Since 1996"  8^ {

It's a strange phenomenon that happens so very rarely, where something is redone, a song or movie for example, and ends up better than the source material --   *More Real Than The Original*  ...Buffy the Vampire Slayer television show vs. movie    ...Jimi Hendrix vs. Bob Dylan All Along The Watchtower (even Dylan admitted it was Jimi's song now)  There is a restaurant concept sweeping the valley right now, based on a certain small number (between 1 and 3) of people of a certain philosophy (free-wheeling, nature-loving, noodly-music-listening) and their crazy atmosphere establishments full of odd "paraphernalia".  Well, think about how one of those places got your hopes up and then  left them dashed, and head on over to Rocket Burgers & Subs for everything you thought you'd get with those other guys:  ~A fresh, clean, uncluttered atmosphere that you can sit comfortably inside of while enjoying your meal. ~A HUGE selection of almost any kind of soft drink you'd desire to quench that thirsty, dry mouth of yours. ~Lots of variety of menu, all with inexpensive good quality items of decent portion ~A radio playing the xmsirius Grateful Dead Channel for your soothing/stimulating dining pleasure. ~and a couple of really nice, friendly, hippy-on-the-inside-not-just-for-show restauranteurs eager to discuss their business and products, who are not only present now, but seem that they'll be sticking around to ensure the quality and value of their new place doesn't wane.  The food is fresh, fast, and inexpensive.  If you want burgers, subs, dogs, pizza-bread, gyro, salad, handmade fries &  onion rings, PBJ with homemade jam  -- they've got it.  The chicken sandwich had a light crispy breading and a solid chunk of breast meat.  The burger was a smaller patty (available as a double) but not dry, and the condiments were fresh and generous.   For both sandwiches, the standout part was the fresh bun from Simply Bread (local).  It was soft/firm enough to be just right, and had great flavor. They have a cooler chock full of interesting and bizarre selections from Pop The Soda Shop (Jones Soda, imported ginger ales and root beers, glass bottle real sugar sodas from mexico, dublin dr pepper, etc). My spicy Bleinheim Ginger Ale did not skimp on the ginger flavor!  A couple of real ex hippies would do it like this --  no flashy superficial emphasis on outward appearances and gimmicks, just quality, freshness, and friendliness that is truly genuine and sincere. I feel like I made a new friend. Rocket Burgers & Subs is one out of this world place, and I'm glad it landed in my neighborhood.

Allow me to break it down.  Arrive at a boofay and pay at 8:37pm (per receipt).   After taking a seat and gathering drinks, proceed to boofay tables to commence face stuffing selections.   Notice a lot of usual items absent or severely depleted. Ask Too-Much-Cologne-Stinky-Manager-Guy at cash register what time is closing time. When he replies 9pm, but you may continue to eat until 9:30, I confirm that they will continue to replenish food items up until 9pm, otherwise I want to get refund and forget it, there's not enough time. He assures that they'll continue cooking and asks me to simply inform him of any missing items.   I do -- two main entree items that they advertise as 'signature' items. I wait around for the items they're supposed to be cooking, all the while watching as other dishes become emptied and are not refilled.   I ask about the original two, and one of these other dishes, and Polite-but-Unfortunate-Puppet-for-Stinky-Cologne-Manager Asst Manager goes in the back and comes out to tell me they aren't cooking anymore.  I relay to him my previous convo with Too-Much-Cologne-Stinky-Manager-Guy and say what gives?   After checking with Too-Much-Cologne-Stinky-Manager-Guy in a mysterious back office location, Polite-but-Unfortunate-Puppet-for-Stinky-Cologne-Manager Asst Manager informs me that it has been decided that it's not appropriate for me to receive a refund in this situation and there's nothing he can do. I remind Polite-but-Unfortunate-Puppet-for-Stinky-Cologne-Manager Asst Manager that I paid by credit card, and if I truly have not received the goods that I paid for, I'll just file a dispute with them.   He goes in the back again. (am I buying a car, here, or what?) Upon return, Polite-but-Unfortunate-Puppet-for-Stinky-Cologne-Manager Asst Manager presents me with a business card, on the back of which Too-Much-Cologne-Stinky-Manager-Guy has hand written a note entitling me to one (1) free adult boofay at any time of day. There were three of us in the party, and apparently Too-Much-Cologne-Stinky-Manager-Guy has decided that since I'm the only one complaining then I must be the only one who deserves a free meal credit.  Poor customer service has made me second guess my love of cheap ass boofays.  I guess i'll just stick with my nasty indie china boofays and avoid this WalMart of Culinary Mass Volume all together.

Reviewing their food for the first time at their new restaurant location in far north phoenix (Deer Valley Airport only USED TO be the boonies), but i've been hearing about their meat for some time now.  A delicious smoky aroma gently smacks you around and lulls you into submission once you enter.  A simple menu offers the lunch selection (soon to offer breakfast too). I knew i wanted pulled pork as an entree, and honestly didn't notice what else they had.    The usual side offerings of beans, potato salad, and coleslaw never appeal to me, personally.  I don't fault them for that, but a pickle spear being my only other available side left me feeling less than satiated.  Maybe some french fries, or at least chips?    The pulled pork sandwich had a nice smoky flavor, and the meat was juicy without being fatty.  The bun was simply generic.  Maybe these guys could get into cahoots with a local baker to put their special meat on something a little more worthy?    The sauces offered were "Sweet Mild" (which was both) and "Hog Wild Hot" (which was neither, but still tasty).  Both had a distinct molasses sweetness in a thick tomatoey base, the Hot with a little more spice flavor to it, but not much heat at all.  The atmosphere is simple and clean.  Ribs, breakfast, and "Swine & Dine" nights are on the way, according to the owners. Look forward to many more days of coming back to work smelling like a meat smoker !

They've now added several menu items, including brats in many flavors, seasoned waffle fries and sweet potato fries.    While finishing up our HUGE sandwich of smoky, porky goodness, the owner invited Daren and I over to taste a sample of a new HOT sauce he was developing (in response to customer comments, of course). It was tangy and had a nice smokiness and a bit more heat than the other sauces.  Looking forward to a final version on the tables, but I have to recommend these midwesterners get out and sample more of what this part of the country considers a baseline as far as Scoville units!  8^ )  ... going back to work in a Hickory/Mesquite cloud gave them some great free advertising.

Funky little independent eastern-european-owned bakery, pastry, and cake shop that also does a handful of sandwiches.  Doesn't sound like much, but tastiness and quality aren't necessarily noisy. 8^ )  I'd often passed this place on my way somewhere else, seeing their European Bakery sign and thinking they MIGHT have a deli, but they aren't advertising it, so why take the chance.  Daren C and I finally stopped in, and we were glad we did.  The breads are all made fresh daily with what the owner is proud to tell you are his own versions of classic european recipes, and the meats are all imported.  The owner is quite happy to talk about how he sends back a slab of pastrami several times if it doesn't look right ot him. If the man tells you that he put together all of the sandwich recipes because those are the ingredients that taste best together, you would be wise to heed that man!  For 6.50-7.25, you get a HUGE sandwich on a fresh-baked sub-baguette.  Daren's Italian had everythign you could think of, and was a veritable UN of sandwiches, it had meat and cheese imported from so many different places.  My roast beef with roasted red peppers and swiss was absolutely delicious -- like a rare steak, a small salad, and bread all wrapped up in my hand for lunch, instead of spread out on a dinner plate.  The baked goods are where the husband and wife team claim to really shine, and it sure did look and smell wonderful. There are an assortment of pastries and baklava and other tasty treats to select from, both familiar and unfamiliar looking.  TheFrench bread the sandwich was made on was tasty and soft inside/ crisp outside. Their other loafs looked and smelled delicious.  And for only 2.99 for a full sized loaf i know i'll come back and try more bread flavors soon.

I must say that this is a 5 star combination of those things that make an establishment deserve the coveted 5th star~  Excellent, Friendly Customer Service  Fresh, High Quality Ingredients and Superb Quality Control  The Pastrami is DELICIOUS here!  The fresh $2.99 loaves are huge!  Crusty on the outside and soft on the inside.    Mmm, Bread.  }^ )

Funky little breakfast and lunch cafe with an ecclectic menu.  Some may say a jack of all trades masters none, but to know a little about everything is exactly the kind of knowledge a cafe "chef" should have.  Where else in the known universe can one indulge in a Rainbow Doughnut and breakfast burrito in the morning, then come back to the same place and not be able to decide if you want a pizzasteak sandwich, spicy Terriyaki chicken bowl, or fried bologna for lunch?  Awesome friendly service from Bobby, too. Yes, that's him. Say hello and make a special request.  If he has the food in the building, he'll cook it for you however you like!

updated 8-5-11 I tried again, and it still has the stupid glitter, but I'll focus on the food.... No good.  Average, if I'm generous. They put way too much food out at any given time for the amount of customers, meaning it sits around getting un-fresh waiting for you to come around.   As you poke and prod the item's unappetizing shiny (greasy) exterior, wondering if every goldamn thing in the building is cooked in a deep-fryer, you reluctantly find a less-grissly or fatty bit to relinquish to your plate.   By the time you get back to you horribly decorated table, the oiliness of each dish has congealed into a lukewarm film coating the thing.    Some people say bigger is not always better. I say Bigger is always not better.   ===========================================  Sorry, but here's the thing: You can't put glitter designs on the table tops with a stencil and white glue, with tiny pieces of the metal chips flaking off from the pattern and migrating all over the entire surface of the table.   That isn't food-sanitary, in my opinion.

This new place is not your average fast-food chicago/greek style gyro joint, at all.  It's so much better....  This is a fast casual semi-fine dining version of one of those restaurants.  The place is an oasis of clean and cozy considering the strip mall location.  They offer several authentic and freshly prepared choices for lunch and dinner, and use beautiful pictures of the dishes as part of the menu.   This not only helps a person less familiar with the food to select an item, but also ensures that you see SEVERAL dishes that look splenderific, causing you to plan your next visit before you've even finished ordering today's meal !  I've had their delicious gyro and falafel sandwiches for lunch, but also the unexpectedly exciting marinated chicken breast sandwich, and sampled a few other dishes. Every time Daren C and I have been in for lunch, they've offered a bowl of soup as an appetizer -- several flavors have all been tasty.  The food is really good, 4 - 4.5 stars.  The service is what really takes this place over the top into solid 5 star rating territory.  The husband and wife team running the show are friendly and will chat with all the new customers and 'new regulars' (the place isn't that old, but there are regulars already).    Watch for the little boy, though -- maybe 4 or 5 years old.   This little charmer who hangs out in the dining area is not only super polite, but he is likely to give you a shy "Are you enjoying your soup?", with no prompting from either parent.   While Daren and I ate last week, we heard his dad telll the story of how this little guy suggested they get one of those sign spinners, since it would be a good way to tell people about their new restaurant.  That little dude will be running this place someday.  It's certainly good enough to stay in busniess long enough.

Brought my family in for dinner on a Saturday, and we were literally treated like guests in their home.  This great, family-run, independant, unique eatery is just what everyone hopes for in their neigborhood.  If you're not in the neigborhood, don't worry, you'll be welcomed whole-heartedly. Drive past as many local fast food gyro joints as you need to on the way, and you'll be glad you did.

Since my last review update, SUPERB SERVICE, has been the number one reason I keep going back over and over and over and over again.  That does not discount the DELICIOUS FOOD made with QUALITY INGREDIENTS, least of which is genuine LOVE for serving their customers.  Ninos has added numerous menu items to try, and even though I am a loyal fan of the chicken sandwich on garlic bread and the 2 meat plattter, everything else tried has been worth the venturing away from my favorites.   I know of at least two customers that are in the restaurant EVERY TIME my brother and I stop in, and after initiating conversation found out that they are there LITERALLY EVERY DAY (one gentleman sometimes comes TWICE the same day, lunch and dinner). Yes! There is enough variety to sustain this kind of obsession!  Several times I have gone two days in a row, myself, or dinner one night and lunch the next day.  You will not find better food or service at any equivalent place. Sounds like hyperbole, but it's true!

I eat at boofays all the time, so believe it or not my problem isn't with allowing patrons to handle their own serving utensils and potentially cross-contaminate food allergens or bacteria.  My problem at Ghenghish Ghrihll (where the heck do you put the "H" again?!?) is with the way the staff handles their meat. Sounds pretty yucky, and it is.  After going through a useless ordering procedure instruction by the server, the complications of which are rivaled only by the ridiculous ChinoBandido http://www.yelp.com/biz/chino-bandido-phoenix-3#hrid:Rc5orUUva9KTB4kMp7EgMw , I winced as i grabbed a serving tong laying on top of a pile of raw meat, dished out my portion, and went on touching other serving utensils on the veggies and spices and sauces. GROSS.  Guessed about what to put on the dang thing, and was scared, really, since the server warned to be sure to know you like what you put on by tasting it with a tiny spoon ( from a bowl where it was touched by all those other peoples' grubby germ-laden meat-tongs-hands) .  GROSS.   Thinking that "well, at least it's going to be cooked now," I hand my dish of e-coli-laden vegetables and warm grey meat chunks to the ''chef'' and scurry into the restroom to wash my hands with soap.   When the food finally comes (long wait) to our table in the overly cramped dining room, the portion is onderwhelming and the thing is ugly.  The veggies are overcooked, and when i try the meat chunks, they are undercooked to the point of being rubbery instead of flaking apart as i chew. GROSS.  I will admit i got lucky and concocted a decent flavor, but it was a total fluke.  Unimportant.    I was counting on that warm, grey, pile of exposed-to-the-public meat being cooked through and through to eliminate any food borne bacteria sure to be lingering around after its recent history of unhealthy handling.  The server was more than happy to allow me to fill another bowl, and the guys said i could have them start cooking the meat first and add veggies later , but why should i have to ask for that?    Well, it didn't matter, because i never got the chance to even have them cook up that second bowl.  As i stared down at the sloppy serving station, trying to decide if thinly sliced meat meant more or less chance of bacteria, I watch a staff member fill up the raw chicken tray with more rubbery chunks.  He does not place the new container in the server and pour the old meat on top of it, but instead simply pours new, frozen meat on top of the old thawed meat already in the bin.  This is not only against common sense, but against food handling procedure.    Who knows how many times he refilled this way that day, or how long the meat down in the bottom of that container had been sitting there?!?   GROSS.  If asked whether I prefer to allow all of that sort of thing to just go on behind the closed doors of a kitchen where i can't see it - YES, that's exactly what I prefer.

_..~~``''  F YOUR I ''``~~.._  not sure if permanent or temporary, but paper sign on door says CLOSED MONDAY   I like Pete's thai boofay for lunch. The food was very good, and it was a reasonable price.    There were a lot more selections than I thought they could possibly fit in the two buffet tables. If you're a poor decision maker it may be overwhelming in a good way.     Even if you're a cautious newcomer to thai food saying "I'll stick to lean meat with veggies in a simple tasty sauce" you still have at least a half doozen choices.   The only thing I wish were available were more fresh/cold veggies or salad fixins.  2 kinds of hot soup and plenty of tofu options were available.  Service was very friendly when they were paying attention, but seemed to only come by the table when i was back up to the buffet, thereby avoiding interaction. Although I cannot say it was on purpose, it just left me feeling rather unattended to at times, even if the drink got refilled and the dirty plate disappeared. No biggie.  I like Pete's thai boofay for lunch. The food was very good, and it was a reasonable and very lucky feeling price at $7.77  Everything was clean and neat inside.  Place looks weird outside, sure, but so what.  If we judged a book by its cover, how well would YOU fare, huh?

Brand spankin new.  Staff flits about like hummingbirds, primping, tidying, friendlying up patronage with check-ins and cookie samples.     There's a real executive chef supervising the highly visible goings on behind the glass partition between the dining and food prep areas.  There is real pro-culinary experience back there.  The breads are baked fresh on premises daily.       A surprising amount of variety can be found in the menu, with all the usuals, plus a few nifties like the Meaty Spud, a crispy-shell bbq-taco-salad thing, or a 10 oz burger.       The breads are baked fresh on premises daily.        Lunch prices were very reasonable for a sandwhich+side+drink combo.  Take home prices for meat were a little less thrifty. They make batches for each day and don't keep food for the next day, though, so if you come in 3-4pm you get a discount on the selection that does remain.     There will be tweaking with a place this new, such as a conversation Daren and I had with Chef J about kicking up his special sauce a notch or two on the heat, which he happily heard us say, since he'd originally had it much hotter, and told us to plan for it to be next time.       We've got our eye on the burger, which Chef J and the owner both talked up as a custom crafted 80/20 chuck recipe that will endure minimal processing or handling, never frozen, cooked over a charcoal grill.  Guess where and when the buns are freshly baked?

after going back for a second visit for the burger, I moved these guys up to 5 stars, because they're classy, clean, use fresh high quality food, and are responsive to customers.  Ric's is the best place to go get BBQ in the area, because they cook the meat in such a way that you don't have to go around smelling like a campfire all day, just for having set foot in their store.  FUDANGAH !

PORK BURGERS !!   (please, sir - I'm using that as an adjective, not a verb)  ahem THEY HAVE PORK-BURGERS !!   A delicious addition to the menu. The only problem is, I already had a short list of must-try-it-next-time that I can never seem to get to, since everything I've had I loved so much I didn't want to order anything else. ( until the next time Ric or Chef J talked me into trying something new, that is )  This is the new favorite.  I don't even put any catsup or sauce on it, just meat, bread, veggies.   French fries are hand-cut and double fried to a crispy-chewy constistency that is rare and satisfying.  I really mean to try to 'Loaded Spud' and the chopped chicken someday, but between the burger, porkburger, and pulled pork, I may never get there.

Do not be fooled by the name - all of these Hibachi Grill & Supreme Boofay's popping up around town are under different ownership, with quite different recipes coming from the kitchens.  this location claims to be the largest in the valley, but it must mean sq. footage or something, because the selection was lacking. There seemed to be a ton of food trays, it's just that nothing very good was in them.  A lot of repetetive dishes, a lot of starchy  filler-uppers.   Way too much non-chinese food.  If i wanted hot dogs, kelbasa, chicken nuggets, etc i'd go to Old Timers boofay, not a China Boofay.  Everything in the place seems to have an oily sheen from it's time spent cooking in the deep fryer, since this seems to be the only way anything is prepared.  The entry way is impressive looking, and if you're not really paying much attention, you may get beguiled by the flashy lights and clanking knives of the live sushi and hibachi chefs, but do not be fooled.  This is ameri-chino fare at it's most mediocre, and not worth the price they charge.

Vibrantly painted walls with circus patterns and jester hats & faces greet you at Jester's, along with a friendly welcome from the gentlemen running the show behind the counter.   (NOTE: If you have an evil clown phobia, one of the paintings may be borderline, but just remember these are jesters, not clowns. Clowns are sad men who pretend to be happy in order to make you laugh because you feel sorry for them. Pitiful. Jesters performed out of fear for their life, though. They weren't pretending, it was genuine and real. So real that if they weren't any good....KCHXXXSZ   "OFF WITH HIS HEAD! That's Brave. Big difference.)  You'll find a small but solid assortment of fixin's for your fully customized burrito, tacos, enchiladas, taco salad, or whatever you'd like to make from the ingredients they have, apparently! In burrito form, both the chunked chicken and shredded carnitas pork were quite good. The meat is grilled fresh and simply seasoned, giving folks a chance to add heat from outside sources as desired. Considering the demographic of far north phoenix that Jester's serves, this is a much better idea than serving meat that is overspiced from the start.   The mild fire roasted salsa was also quite mild. ( a hotter version is offered, no worries ) When i mentioned to my brother that it's flavor remined me in some way of a batch of salsa that i tried to make myself once, he asked "is that a good or a bad thing?"  Well, it's not a bad thing, but although i rather enjoyed it's tasty flavor -- which tasted to me as if it may have red pepper pureed into it somehow, but i could be wrong -- i will say that this mild salsa's flavorful, interesting taste is different enough from what most people are used to that it may get some criticism for that. i enjoyed it.  I didn't taste the hotter red version this time, but their Verde tomatillo salsa was absolutely delicious - tangy with a roasted mild kick to it.   I will enjoy trying some other menu items at Jester's. Carnitas tacos sounds like a good short term goal. I believe I will achieve it. I was trying to bring a tie back to the jester story here, but saying that i'd come back out of bravery or out of fear for my life, as opposed to pity, would seriously convey the entirely wrong idea!   Go to Jesters, like i will go back, because of the good food and friendly service. No better reason needed. At the risk of getting my head cuttoff by the king, that's no joke.  ~*KCHXXXSZ *~

First, I'm going to call out several of these fake reviews and welcome any newbie yelpers to be my 'friend', but i know it won't happen.  Secondly, within a two mile radius two indian food restaurants closed within a year, one just a month ago, and three new indian restaurants have opened. You have to either question the intelligence or admire the huevos of any business owner opening a restaurant amidst so much competition. Unfortunately, in this case, it won't turn out to be such a bold, impressive move. I can't see these restaurants all surviving in the area at the same time, and the best will find it's way to the top.  It won't be Indian Paradise 2.   After a couple of tries, this place is just not that good.  They offer a somewhat larger appearing selection than some of the other indian buffets. The first visit, when they had a busy rush due to their grand opening, this larger selection seemed like a good thing. However, on the second visit, when it was slower,  the food was sitting out aging for too long compared to their customer count, so it did not stay fresh.   The dishes are decidedly unimpressive, and ethnically confusing.  Imagine a dish that is basically a chinese lo mein noodle, with a flavor profile similar to mexican spanish rice, and there's also a chinese chicken dish with indian spices.  There was a decent curry, but the masala tasted like salsa. (Perhaps the written recipe had a typo, who knows?)  The "mango" chutney and custard have mango-flavored pears and other mixed canned fruit bits.    The bread that came as I finished my lunch was hot and fresh, and very full of fresh garlic bits, but also had some weird anise seed baked into the dough, imparting an odd licoricey flavor that I didn't enjoy.  Sitting down to a Stella Artois water glass was just stupid, and the multiple pieces of FLY PAPER strips hanging from the ceiling, one over a food prep/bar area, the other over a customer dining table, just really ensured that I won't be back, not even to fall for another $2 off coupon.  I am not sure which dish it was that my body chemistry altered as it attempted to digest, and it made me all burpy the entire afternoon - and the burps tasted like the non-marshmallow, oatey, catfood bits of Lucky Charms.

Very friendly service : customer first.   Stopped for couple bags of ice. There wasn't even a pitch that I could call a soft sell, just really a mention of the expensive, special, magic water, then he offered a brochure and just let it be.  My bill was cheaper than I thought but I only had a debit card, no cash. Instead of suffering the transaction charges from visa for such a small bill, he insisted I just take the ice bags and "get him back next time". Now, your mileage may vary, so dont go in expecting the same and don't take advantage of their hospitality...like I did. Still owe them a buck seventy five.  OOPS, I'm coming dont worry
