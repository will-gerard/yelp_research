The food and staff are always very good. I order something I did not like and they took it back and got me something different. They were very apologetic management came over asked if he could sit down and and talk to me about the issue wrote down why I did not like the meal after I got my new food came back again and made sure I was happy with it and bought me a desert. Outstanding service. Will be back

Service was so slow. Took for ever to get waited on and soft drinks took a long time as well. Then after placing our order (2) orders of fish and chips and (1) 1/2 rack of ribs took over 45 mins to be brought out. The waiter had to flagged down to get refills ever dissapointed in the service.

I have tried a number of things now.  I think my favorite is the Green chille burrito.  This is family owned and operated.  The staff speak English and take customer service with pride. This a great whole in the wall.

My girlfriend and I got the Orange Chicken Combo to split.  With an extra order of crab puffs the Combo was more then enough for the 2 of us it came with the Orange Chicken, 1 egg roll, 1, crab puff,  rice and low main. It was all very good we will be back.  The staff were very nice and caring took pride in what they serve.

I  have been eating here for years.  The food and service was excellent I think it is kinda pricy but the portions are good so I guess it's worth paying a little more.  I love there hot sauce and chips and think there cheese crisps are excellent.

The staff for the most part are all really nice and friendly only a few of them are kinda rude and don't seem to really care about there job or patients.  As for the Doctors they seem to be in a hurry to discharge you as soon as they can.  But I'm sure that's because of the corrupt insurance companys.

My daughter was taken to Arrowhead Hospital on 11/26/11 by the Peoria Fire Dept after passing out 2 differnt times, hitting her head, throwing up, and shaking and wetting her pants. Her nurse was so rude to her and my wife and I. Her bed side manner was so far off base. The so called P.A. that was taking care of her seemed like she did NOT care or want to take the time out to figured out what was really going on with her. I would have rather had a vet take care of my daughter then this so called P.A. who spent a total of 10 mins with her. All she did was order a number of labs to be done then after they were done she  came in said everything came back okay and said "Some people just pass out for no real reason its nothing to worry about just go home a rest." This was the first time she even saw her. She just did not want to take the time out to figure out what could be going on. Trust me I would not take a frog there for a Band-Aid. I hope this is helpful and hope you are all in good health.  Brian

I have been to Great Clips a number of different times and have always been satisfied but my visit there on Thursday, 01/16/2014, was the last time I will ever go there again!!!!! It was at the Great Clips in the Deer Valley Marketplace located at the corner of W. Deer Valley Road & N. 83rd Ave. in Peoria.  When I first got there one of the women looked my name up under my phone number and put me on the waiting list. Then another woman called me up to the counter and asked for my name. I told her my name and she said it wasn't there. Then she asked for my phone number. I told her but I had to repeat it several times. She was very rude and was extremely hard to understand due to her accent. She said her name was Nina (later when I looked at the receipt it showed her name to be Niculina). She directed me to a chair and asked me how I wanted my hair cut. I asked her if she could check the notes in the computer to see how it had been cut the last few times I had been in because I wanted it cut the same way. She walked over to the computer and looked at it for a few seconds and said "something happened to computer, there's nothing" and walked back to the chair. I told her how I wanted it cut but she wanted to do it differently. I told her no to do it like I said. Well after she cut my hair (If you can call it that) I asked her if she could rinse my hair off in the sink, not shampoo just rinse with water so I could get all the extra cut hair off and she said no she would have to charge me for a shampoo. So I asked if I could do it myself and she said no. Then she immediately put gel in my hair without even asking if I wanted any in my hair. It was ok because I use gel in my hair anyway but I thought it was odd. Well after I got home from having dinner I took a shower and my wife looked at me and said OMG!!! Your hair!!! Go look at it!" It is REALLY REALLY BAD! I have bald spots in a number of places where my hair is cut all the way to the scalp! How does someone do that?! Then there are other places that have long hairs that she did not even cut! To top it all off when I looked at my receipt she didn't even spell my name correctly, it reads Brayen not Brian??? I have e-mailed them and also called their corporate office and I am still waiting for them to call me back. The sad thing is I am job hunting and now I have hair that looks like a monkey cut it for bananas. I'm not saying ALL the stylists there are bad but if you do go there just make sure you DO NOT have Niculina (Nina) cut your hair.

I have to say this place has the very best Fry Bread in town. It blows the State Fair away by far. The place is small but that is fine it makes it seem more family owned. They really take pride in the food the put out and they give you a lot. The desert fry bread is great also.

I eat at Arby's including this location a number of times a week. I get there beef and cheddar I have always got them 2 for $5.00 when i was rang me up it was almost $9.00 I asked  the casher if they were not on sell anymore she was looking it up when Joe the manger came up and said very rudely if you don't have a coupon then you pay full price. I told him I have never needed one before he said well you should have and will for now on, so if you want them you will pay full price for them! He was just very rude about it. I am unsure if I will come back to this store again.

As we had great food. I have been eating here for years. I have taken my gf here 2-3 times now since we been together. We took the kids here for the first time and I think that was a bad idea. Not Because anything was bad or went wrong it's because every time we want pizza it has to be from Anzios lol. No more having delivery because it's not good enough. I get we only like Anzios they are the best please we will be good if you love us you guys will take us there. Lol.. They are right it is the best pizza wings and great spaghetti and lasagna. Oh yeah now they also tell me when they get older they want to work there so we can get a discount and can eat there all the time. Lol

Tried it for the first time tonight. I guess my expectations were set too high by all the reviews I read. I order cheese enchiladas and the cheese was NOT melted inside. I also ordered a bean burrito and the beans were very good. The guy taking orders was not very friendly at all.

Today our dinner was not very good nor was the service. Waitress was not frindly at all more or seemed very put out when she was asked for anything. We got 2 cheese crisps well they were crisp alright burnt, the red chile burrito the meat was tough and 3rd the fish tacos also were very well done. They were not very busy not the best night to take my daughter out for her High School graduation dinner. I think we all would of enjoyed taco bell more. The last time we went 2 weeks ago it was only okay I did not update my rev8then as I don't like righting negative things and was hoping it was just a off night. Guess not seems like it's going down hill. To bad guess we will be going to Popoo's on Indian School for now on. Even if the parking sucks.

John the owner and Rod are very friendly out are honest. They take pride in the work the do. If you have been to another auto repair shop go to him and ask him if the work really needs to be done. They will not try to take advantage of you or do work that is not needed.  They are very big on Women, elerdery and young not getting ripped off. The price is are a little high but no more then any other shop and you will know it's done right the first time. He had done work on my truck, my mom's care and other family members. I don't trust people working on my stuff because I been ripped off. He also saved my parents a ton of money because the dealer to them the needed a lot of stuff done that was not needed. It can't hurt to talk to them and get a second opinion.

This was the worst service I have ever had anywhere.  My family should have just walked out it took over 1 hr to get our food out ( a family of 5) we  complained to manager and she said I'm sorry I only have two cooks tonight.  When the food came one meal was not even there.  one meal  was the wrong meal.  The third meal was messed up.    But to be nice the gave us 10% off that was a whole $4.86 off  what a joke. I will be never eating there again.  We spent over 50 dollars.  The only good part was the waiter was very nice and you could tell he felt really bad.

After my last experience I was done with Domino's.  Well after a nice phone call from the manager I believe his name was Jacob. He made everything right and fixed the issue. Tonight we tried them again and everything was perfect there were no issues at all. Will order from them again in the future.

It's a small mom and mom place. If your in a hurry it's not the place to go but it is worth the wait. The only thing I have had was there pizzas. The toppings are fresh pizza is hot a little of the pricey side. But it's worth it. They been there for years. There deep dish is okay the only thing I don't like about it is there is a lot of sauce on it the put it on top of it. That's to keep the toppings from burning but it's good.

My girlfriend and I ate here last night. We used a Groupon for $20 worth of food for $10. The food was good and even though they were crazy busy they were still very friendly and attentive. You have to put your name on the list when you walk in, literally- you have to write your name on their list that's kept on a clip board by the register. The only snag was that we were waiting outside and when they called our name inside first someone else took our table. We went in to check to see how much longer it was going to be and saw our name had been crossed off. When we brought this to the attention of the hostess she apologized and made it right by seating us immediately. We will definitely be going back.

The one star is for the rude ness of the owner and I assume his wife. Tried getting some information on what some of the times were and what was in it. They seemed very put out we were trying to place a to go order. The place was empty so there should not be rushed. After we asked about a few things he was sitting down by the register and then started talking In Chinese to the lady. He started razing his voice and she told us he didn't want to sell to us. What why??? She just said he said no.

place is dirty smells staff are rude. placed a phone order walked in and was shocked by how it looked inside. I walked up to the counter and someone slicing the pizza sneezed and kept cutting pizza. I started to walk off and was asked if I needed something? I said "No not now. I placed a order but after seeing someone sneezing and cutting pizza I don't want to eat here." I was told well you still need to pay for it we made it so you have to buy it! I walked out and a manger called and told me I need to come back and get my pizza or I could never order a pizza from another Peter Piper Pizza again!!! I hung up and they called back I refused to answer the phone.

We had not eaten here for a number of months. So my Daughter and I thought we would have it delivered. We got the Orange Chicken and Beef and broccoli. They both had little flavor and the beef was tuff and grisly.  We also got the hot and sour soup and it also lacked flavor.  Very dissapointed. I don't think I will go back.

I have been eating here for a long time there food is always good. Everyone treats you like family. Prices are good the only real down falls are the close early and are not open on Sundays. But there nothing wrong with being closed on Sunday also they do NOT take credit or debit cards only cash and checks.

We ate here on Tuesday 03/06/2012. The service was poor the food was okay but I have to say they really made me mad. My wife ordered the chicken parmesan with the sald bar. Then found out that what you don't eat you can NOT have a to go box. I can under stand them not letting you take your sald home but you can't take you left over chicken parmesan??? That's just crazy I would understand it was a all you can eat but it's not. I will never go back again.

Do NOT go here. It is nothing but a major scam!! But a deal through Amazon for $39.00 it was for the eye exam and $218.00 towards frames and glasses. How ever when I got there and was told that it only covered the eye exam and the lenses NOTHING else!! The lenses them self were almost $300.00. Since I did not have enough to pay for frames and the difference in the lenses a total of $390.00 I had to pay for the eye exam $90.00 for nothing but a eye exam. Very pushy also and lots of up selling.

The one star is because of service and wait tine. We got there at 7:22 and stood at the hostess stand for over 10 minutes. I then picked up a card from the table and called to ask then what was going on. Finally they came after I called her. The girl was very rude. We were carry a baby and had to ask for a high chair. Guess she thought we were going to let her crawl around on the floor or just hold her. Lol I asked for a manager but nope no one ever came. We placed our order and it took for ever to get it. They were NOT busy at all. The food was good but service sucked I will not go back to this location again.

Worst pizza and service without a smile.  Next time I would rather eat frozen cheep pizza then this crap.  It tasted like Tomato sauce with some garlic and salt mixed in.  Cheap cheese and the crust was like pre-made frozen. The staff were more concerned with talking and playing on the cell phones.

Offered to loan me tools to do it my self but with me just having back surgery I am unable to do it. So now I wait they said 45 minutes to an hour. Hope they are right.

Part of our order was made wrong. We didn't notice it until we got home glad we live very close  by.  So my Daughter and I went back when she went in to tell the the lady upfront was rude and treated her like dirt.  Even argued with her about it no customer service at all.  We have not been there in years and I have to say this place has gone down hill and really need to retrain there staff on how to treat customers.. I don't believe that a customer is always right but we when there is an error just fix it and make things right instead of arguing about it.

Once again fail order not correct and even asked them if they remembered to add the brownies to my blizzard was told yes. Got home and there were not one in it.  They were very slow at taking orders and even slower getting them out.. Tried calling but no one would answer (called at 9:00) so yes they were open.  The cheese burger was very dry tasted premade and was sitting in a warmer.

Food was great and so was the service. Sylvia herself was working tonight and made sure everyone was greeted promptly and was taken care of. The servers-not just ours but all of them were friendly and stopped by our take multiple times to check to see if we needed anything. They had a live band playing and they were pretty good. This was the first time in many months that we had been here and the remodeling they had done is amazing. The decor is beautiful and they really improved the look of the restaurant. Over we had a wonderful experience.

I have not been here since 8/10/12. Today we stopped by and had lunch. The food tasted good the service was good but about 20-30 minutes after eating we were all sick. We had bad cramps and to put it nice it was coming right out. Don't think I will be back called and left a message to have a manager call but never heard anything back from one. Will let you know if I hear anything.

We passed by the Sandbar & it looked cool & fun so we decided to stop by for dinner with our family. The previous reviews are right, it's more of a bar than a restaurant. It has a great beach bar atmosphere. It would be a cool place to hang out with friends if you are just going there to have fun & snack a little but if you are going for dinner I will advise you that it is more than just 1 $ in rating. My daughter wanted to get just a taco & it was going to be around $10! I usually get mini chimis from other restaurants so I thought I would try theirs. The mini chimis I get at other places come with 8 mini chimis & a side of jalopeno cream cheese. There was only 4 mini chimis on the plate & the jalopeno cream cheese was inside the chimis & no side. They tasted ok but but we were very dissapointed & won't go back.

Been coming here for a few years and have never had bad service or bad food.  If you have young kids they bring them a small piece of dough to play with. If you want you can watch them make your pizza. All the pizzas are hand tossed it's really neat to see them toss your pizza in the air.

My wife and I ordered to go. I had a bean burrito deep fried enchilada style she got a red Chile burrito the same way as mine. Neither one of cared for the enchilada sauce at all. It ruined both of our meals. The only thing that we both really loved was the chips. Very disappointed might go back for just the chips and flower tortillas I will stick to PoPo's.

Food was okay just not as good as it used too be. The service was beyond out standing. Maybe they were just having an off day. After all we all have bad days. No restaurant can be perfect 100% of the time. I will try them again.

The service we had her today was the best I have ever had at any other AT&T corporate store.  The Rep Jeremiah Wilsery was very helpful took his time and done a out standing job. I will be upgrading to a new phone soon and he will be the one I see.  The person working with him was also very outgoing and helpful.. If you ever need to do anything with AT&T high recommend go to this store.. Trust me I hate dealing with the metro store I was going to before.

The pizza and service has really gone down hill. Seems like they don't care about quality and only think about the quantity they can sell. When you call to tell them there was something wrong with the order they become rude.

We have ate here a number of times. The food was always good however last night it was only far we got the #3 combo green or red chili burrito rice and beans we got the green it did not have a good flaver had much better before. The beans tasted burnt the rice was good.  This was the first time it was not good.  Will try again but not the green burrito.

I came in to get my Jeep washed then Mike & Cody tried talking me in to a $300.00 detail. Lol its a jeep for one and it is a 2002. Anyways they suckered me into having the had wash done. Well I was in a hurry when I left because I had to get some things done. I got home it was dark I did not go anywhere the fallowing day. Now its day 3 when I walk out there was or is dirt still stuck to it. Not just a little but a lot. I called them and was told. "I should of walked around my car before taking it and I should of came back the same day or the next. " I tried telling him it was dark when I got home and I did not go anywhere the fallowing day. But he did not care. I wish I had never gone there. They are crooks.

Tonight we order a pizza and 2 sub's for deliver.  Food arrived in no time. The pizza was very hot and fresh. The cold sub arrived cold with lots of  meat and fresh toppings. I will be ordering again. This place beats all the pizza and sub chains.

The staff are all very frindly. Place is very clean inside and out. The food is good with lots of flavor. I know it's fast food but it is a lot better then Taco Bell and I think it's even better then Filibertos. If your unsure what something is they will explain it to you. They are open 24 hrs but the best thing I like about them is they care about their employees. They are closed on Thanksgiving and Christmas like they should be. I respect that very much.

The pizza and service sucks here The cheese has no flaver and the pizza sauce reminds me somthing that you get out of a can and the crust was tough and reminded me of store bought..... The staff were unhelpfull and rude. The crzyiest thing was when were were going to take our left over pizza home the took our left overs and put them in a fricking paper bag yea a bag not a pizza box. I could only laugh and ask them "wow  you trying to save money on not using pizza boxes??? AS we walked out the bag was sucking up the grease i just left it by there door. I was so pist don't go there frozen pizza is better.

We have eaten at several BBQ places but this was by far the BEST!  The staff were very friendly and the food was delicious! We had the pulled pork sandwich. It was moist and tasty. They had several different types of BBQ sauces to choose from but the pork was delicious without anything on it. The Mac N Cheese was extremely creamy and the corn bread muffin was moist and slightly sweet.   It doesn't have a large marquee sign and it would be easy to miss if you didn't know where you were going or what you were looking for. It looks small from the outside but they have a larger dining in the back. Both dining rooms have a large flat screen TV so you can enjoy sports with your meal.  On our way out we saw the staff making up a beef brisket plate which looked as good as our pulled pork tasted. We will try the brisket next time we go and we  will DEFINETELY go back!

Came here with my family and friends. It's been along time since I have eaten here. The rest of my family has not been here so I wanted to show them how good it was. The place was clean inside unlike other reports and food was very good as it has been in the past. We will be back again also I want to let it be known that the service and all the staff were very nice, caring and out going.

My wife and I went here for dinner. I love pizza and am very picky. I have to say we both really enjoyed our pizza. We also ordered the four (4) cheese backed Spaghetti. Now I never order or eat spaghetti because I really do not care for it. BUT WOW this was GREAT!! I someone who don't care for Spaghetti really enjoyed this meal. The only down side was there garlic bread it tasted like they used butter flavored Pam with garlic. Now they do give you free bread for dinning inn that was very good.  The service was good. I agree with others I wish the tables were a little bigger and they used the trays to left the pizza pan off the table to give you more room since the tables are very tight. We will be back for sure this food was some of the best we have had in a while and beyond the best Spaghetti I have ever had.

I have to say that today Cousin Vinny's really let me down!!! I placed a order for delivery as I have done in the past without any issue but for some reason I guess I am not in there delivery area. Funny I was a few weeks ago but today I am not. The lady who called me back was very rude when I told her I could not pick it up she hung up on me!!! Wow I can not believe this I have ate there more then 50-60 times. Then to be treated like this. I mean if they delivered here before the should of called and said they can deliver here this time but in the future I will have to pick it up. Then just hang up on me WOW!!!!

The pizza is very good I have ate there a number of times since they have opened. I only had one (1) bad pizza out of 15-20. NOT bad I think. The only reason I can't give them a 5 is the girls are young and rather play and  jole around rather wait on you. This has happened a number of times. I will walk in and have to wait to place my order cause they are talking and joking with each other rather then wait on customers. But teens will be be teens and they just don't take things seriously.

My family and I had an OUTSTANDING experience at Jersey Mike's. The staffs were beyond A+!! My 19yr Daughter who is pregnant became ill (NOT FROM THE FOOD) but from her issues she's been having. The staff did everything they could to help out and making sure she was okay. They even stayed late to ensure she was okay to leave with us. We have NEVER had such caring staff restaurant before. Now about our subs WOW they were so good blows Subway, Blimpie and the other so called fresh sub places.

This review is for Friday July 1st.  We tried them for the second time we got there pizzas 2 both were to have extra cheese and light sauce. The pizzas both had a lot of sauce o. Them when we finally got out waters attention and told him he said "Well you did NOT tell me you wanted light sauce so that's how it comes our sauce is the best what would you like me to do have remade now?" I told him well I told you twice light sauce maybe if you wrote it down you would remembered. I asked how long it would be to have them remake it and he said they are busy so probably 20 min or more. We told him for get it because we had plans we tried taking the sauce off with a knife but it was making a mess and felt dumb so we just did not eat there and left. He asked if we wanted to take it with us. No we did not want a ton of sauce we dud not like them. We left 2 almost whole pizzas and hungry will not be back no discount sorry nothing at all.

I want to say from the very beginning that I am very big pizza lover and am a fan of Papa Murphy's. How ever since I just down the street from this location. I must say there a big difference from the location at 51st Ave  & Olive and this store.  My experience I order a Family size with very light sauce and extra cheese. I was unable to watch her make it as I was waiting for the credit card machine that was taking for ever to come back approved the time it did my pizza was made. I asked the girl that made it.. This does have very lite sauce right, she said yes. I then asked her it also has extra cheese right and again she said yes. After I got home it had a lot of sauce and did not have extra cheese.  I don't like a lot of sauce tried to eat it but just couldn't so tossed it out I wasted my money and am hungry. Unsure if I will return waiting on a response back

Let me start off by saying we read the reviews about this restaurant before we went and honestly if it wasn't for the special  anniversary dinnner for my in-laws that we were attending there we would not have even tried it. But since we HAD to go this is our review;  We decided to go in with an open mind and not let the reviews we read tarnish our opinon of the place and let the food do the talking. When we walked in the decor is beautiful and there is a tropical waterfall and pond with gold fish swimming in it. Our spirits were lifted as we now had hopes of a delcious meal. We were severely let down and disappointed. We have been to several asian buffets and this one is by far the worst we have ever been to.  We were a large group of about 30 people and we were in their large "party room".   Service: Not good. They had only 1-2 wait staff that did not understand much English and it took forever to get drinks refilled and our used plates picked up. They would come in about every 30 minutes to pick up the dirty plates and would not refill drinks until after ALL the plates were picked up.  Food: Not good. They did have a number of different things to chose from but most of it did not taste good. We kept trying different things hoping to find something edible for the $10 a person we paid (plus the cost of our drinks) but we didn't. As a matter of fact my wife became sick and one other person did not feel good after eating their food.   They have a number of different flavors of frozen ice cream in a freezer like the kind Baskin Robins uses so you have to reach in and dip your own ice cream out. So now you have 100's of different hands reaching in to get their ice cream. I LOVE ice cream but there was NO WAY I was going to eat it after all the kids and people reaching in there to dish out their ice cream. They use only one ice cream scoop for all of the different ice creams and no one was washing their hands. Thats just nasty and unsafe!!   For people allergic to tree nuts it is dangerous to be using the same scoop for all ice creams since some ice creams have nuts in them. Plus we heard from others in our group that were brave enough to try the ice cream that it was hard as a rock and almost impossible to scoop out.   Some of our group were noting even eating or not eating much and planned on going somewhere else to eat dinner after the party.  Cleanliness: Good. We were satisfied with the cleanliness of the restaurant but not enough to make us go back for food we won't eat.

Toms Thumb is out standing food is hot and fresh with outstanding taste. It goes to show you the pride they take making sure there food is the best. It does not just stop at the food the customer service is some of the best that I have ever had. They really care about there customers and thrive to make your you are happy and feel welcomed. When you want to have great barbecue and want to be treated like family head over to Toms Thumb and give them a try. They will not let you down.

My Family ate here last night 03/08/2012. The service here was better the the other reviews. But the food was NOT as I had hoped it would of been. It just did not have a lot of fl aver and kinda pricey. They don't have much of a menu selection I know they have only been open a few weeks so maybe they can learn to cook and hopefully expand there menu.

I have eaten here a number of times when it's late and don't feel like cooking it's okay not the best but does the job to fill you up. We'll tonight I ordered the 2 cheese enchiladas after I got home and stated eating it I found 2 YES 2 black hairs in my food. I was so grossed out i started gaging. I called them and the lady said "No we don't put hair in food you lying to get free food." Then just hung up. Will NEVER eat here again I will go the extra mile and go to  Federico's on 43rd and Peoria. There cleaner inside and out.

I have taken my daughter here countless times due to all her medical issues. We have never had a issue and have always been treated with 110% respect and have always took the time out to go over her medical history. Not once have we not been treated with less then complete and up most concern. They are very caring and treat you like family. If they are busy the wait time can be a little long but that's only because they take time out to listen to your needs. They are honest and do everything to make sure they take care of your needs before you leave. I trust them with my Daughter and she is my pride and joy. I'm a single parent and that means a lot to put my hands in someone's care.

We had my mom and dad's 50th wedding anaversery party here. The staff were friendly we had the cater the food in house. it was okay we have had better but not too bad. The main issue was it was very HOT in side. They forgot to turn it on early as they had said they would. The chairs they used were very hard after sitting for awhile. How ever the place is very nice inside and out. It would be a lot nicer if you had a event when the weather was cooler.

When I came inside there was no one in line I walked up to the counter. There was a young black guy as the cashier. He was looking down I stood there 2 minutes and I asked him can you take my order or are you busy. He said "what do you want" placed my order I had coupons on my phone and he did know how to do it he said. Really  what??? After getting home with my food it tasted gross we ordered off the LJS it all tasted like the oil was old very unhappy. Could not eat it called store over and over but only got fax picking up.

We came here and got a LG pepperoni pizza with extra cheese and a order of 6 garlic knots.  The pizza was very good wish there was a little more pepperoni on it but there was a fair amount on it. As for the Garlic knots they suck  they were dry and no real flavor. 5 stair for pizza 1 for the knots

Well they really pissed me off to night I called them at 7:45 to be told that they can't take any more deliverys I asked why put me on hold we are closed. I asked I thought you closed at 9:00 ummm back on hold we are closing now. I asked did you change your hrs?  Hold on the owner gets on the phone not very friendly and said we were slow so we are closing and leaving now. The sad thing is they lost a big order tonight and a catering job for this Saturday. I tried talking to the owner letting him know that I had a very big order tonight and he didn't care at.  Guess they don't need money or customers guess that's why they can make up there own hrs.  Now have to find a real pizza place to cater our party. Big loss for them

Well this is my 3rd time here since they moved access the street. The service and food had gone down hill big time. Service is slow, rude unprofessional. The food is poor comes out cold and was wrong. Management does not care and just makes excuses for his staff and food. Plays the blame games but refuse to  compensate you for the bad food and service. When I told him he just said. " Well this is NOT a 5 stair restaurant we are doing the best your food was remade again and you ate that. Even if I got my remade foid when the rest of my family were almost done eating. Was told the cook didn't see the new ticket right away. Since I have tried them 3 times and all three times there were issues I will never be back. Especially since my last reviewe when staff were yelling and fight with one another and again nothing was done. Very sad to see a place run like this.

I would like to let everyone one know of 2 experiences I had at this location. The first one was on Thursday May 5th just before they were closing so I placed my 2 pizzas to go. When I got home the bottom of both pizzas were burnt. I tried calling but as I said they were getting ready to close before I even ordered.. how ever all the staff  were very funny friendly and very helpful.. Well since they were closed I sent them a email.  I revived a reply from Fred and he expressed his deepest apology as well as send me out two complementary coupons replace the Pizza. Fred went out of his way to ensure that things were made right with me and I was happy.. This the most out standing customer service I have seen in a long time.

This place hall really gone down hill since they moved access the the street. I have eaten here 3 different times once the day they moved then about a month latter and my last time for sure tonight. Every time there has been an issue. Food has come out wrong and or cold. The service is slow and and rude. Management does not care. We complained about the food and service and was "told there doing there best and our food is the best. This is not a 5 stair restaurant it's a family restaurant. I told him about the food coming out wrong and cold he said well we remade it for you and you ate that." Did not say sorry or offer to make us happy. Since this was the 3rd time we had a bad experience we will not be back.

I came here after splitting my lip open. Because of the location of were it was split open at there was not a lot they could do without it hurting more.  I also have high blood pressure and when I came here it was really high.  That was there main concern to get that down and make sure I didn't have a stroke.  Dr was very caring as well as the nurses.

Sadly to say this place had really gone down hill.  As for it being clean that's a 5+ stairs as for the staff being nice it's a, 5 also but where they have went down hill is the knowledge of the Doctors.  Due to my Daughter's chronic medical issues and my GF being sick we have had a total of 5 different visits (at different times of day/night)  our first visit was out standing pretty our review.  But our last four they didn't take there time to really figure out what was wrong.. I will admit it's my fault for going back after the last few times.  But figured we our human and can make a mistake.  But the last 2 times I will never go back there for sure. The 2 main issues were ad follows my girlfriend was having a lot of pain in her stomach and has blood in urine and would get dizzy off and on. Against her better judgment I talked her into go to the stand alone ER.  They did some labs and said everything came back good that it was just a start of a UTI.  They gave her some antibiotics and let her go.  We live 5 mins away from there she got home and was still really hurting so she decided to go to Thunderbird Hospital to make sure that everything was okay.  They drew all the same labs and her CBC was all way off white blood count was supper high urine showed blood after doing a ultra sound, MRI and a CT scan they found out that her essure had moved and had poked there her uterus wall and needed surgery. Not a UTI and labs were NOT  okay like they said it was..  Now two our last issue my daughter has a number of medical issues she had been having lower left side stomach pain and was throwing up unable to hold anything down. Due to it be really late we just went to Dignity that was a mistake. To start off she has a device called a port (it's used to draw blood,  give IV's because her veins blow easy from when she getting Infusions every 3 weeks.) they wanted to start a IV and draw blood we let them know that they will need to access her port because her veins our bad but they refused to do it after 3 tines and no luck I got pist and made them use her port  they the labs came back good and was told it was food poisoning.  The next day she was in  more pain and she followed up with her PCP who sent her to Thunder Hospital they ran a number of tests and found out she had a severe infection in intestine and needed IV antibiotics,  a upper and lower GI and potassium... Please do not go there for anything big.  Even though they call it a stand alone ER it's really like a glorified urgent care.

Okay now I have been here for the last time for sure.  Every single time I go the mess up my order.  There is always something missing or wrong. The staff are nuts yelling at each other.  When you tell them and show them there is something wrong or missing they act like it's your fault.  If you get a to go order I STRONGLY SUGGEST that you check it before you leave!!!

The  employees here are a bunch of rude smart ass punks.  They don't care about there customers  at all.  When they mess up on a special order and you call them they tell you well I cannot do anything unless you bring the whole pizza back. Well I'm not driving all the way back there can I get a credit no if you can bring me the pizza now I'm sorry I can't help you is there anything else you need?? Yes your name hang up

I am VERY PICKY and hate to try new things.. Well I have to Thank my GF Ashley for taking me into trying Pie Wei because they are amazing.  The servings are big and the flavor is right on.  The staff are all friendly and take there time to explain what's in the different dishes. You order at the counter and they give you a # sign to place on your table. When your order is ready they bring it to you.  They have a big selection of self serve soda with free refills.

Not very happy with our lunch experience on 03/16/16 we got seated right away but took a while to get waited on.  There was some confusion guess they thought our order was taken already.  I order the BBQ sliders WITH OUT the onion things well it came out with them on it. I told her I ordered it without Onion and she said I didn't here you tell me that if you did. I hate Onion.  We were in a big hurry so I just picked them off because I know that all they would have done in the back.  It was only okay because in the back of my mind I new there were onions on it fried or not I hate Onion  my GF hot the prime rib sliders it was very tuff and fatty she did not eat but 1/2.  No one came back to check on us even.  We had to ask someone else for refills X2.  When she did come back with the check and saw my GF didn't eat much she first said those are so good you get fill already.  We told her how it was showed her the fat and all she said was do you want a box.  Lol no its not eat able.  Oh okay is there anything else you guys want desert.  After telling her no gave our check.  No sorry or let me get the manager.  She seemed very new scarred and unsure of her self. Was hoping this was going to be a lot better because I wanted to do my parents anniversary here. I really hope things get better and this was a off day.  I wish you guys the best of luck and welcome you to Glendale. God bless
