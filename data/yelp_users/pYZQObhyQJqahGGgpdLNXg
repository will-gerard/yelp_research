Absolutely delicious pancakes. I can't wait to return to Pittsburgh for these pancakes. The word on the street is, Obama loves Pamela's too. But how could anyone not?

The title of their website says it, well, best: "Best_Sandwiches."

Unremarkable, if not downright disagreeable, sushi and an odd atmosphere make this one of the dumpiest places I'll not return to.

Who that within two months of adding a bar & kitchen, Lux could have quite probably the *best burger in Phoenix*?  Green chili cheddar burger: Highly recommended.  The bartenders are great, too. Have them mix you something new.

Delicious. Gigantic servings. You've been warned.  One of the few places I can find a Biltmore benedict (with lox). Anything with corned beef will be great; I love their corned beef hash (with Cholula).

I came in with an open mind, and Papaya Thai has very fair prices, but I would not come back here again. The Pad Thai was completely soaked in what tastes like Mae Ploy sweet chili sauce (http://is.gd/9UkrI) -- a good sauce but it completely ruined the Pad Thai. The yellow curry was a bit runny and just not impressive. The worst part was the mango smoothie -- super generic and didn't taste much like mangoes. The Thai Iced Tea, however, is great; but that's great most places. The ambiance was poor, too; there were specials chintzily painted on the windows

Their mango smoothie is quite delicious and the baristas are always friendly.

Mood Swings is a fun and relaxing experience. I have never had a bad cut here. Since they use Aveda products, everything smells good in an herbal sort of way. The ladies are friendly, and so is Juan. Rachel usually cuts my hair and I must say, not only is she sharp with the shears, she is a great listener - about my hair and about everything else, too. Mood Swings is lucky to have her in their employ.
