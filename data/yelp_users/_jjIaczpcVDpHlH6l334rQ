This place used to be REALLY REALLY REALLY good.  I'm not sure exactly what happened, but the food went WAY downhill!  While the portion sizes went lower and the prices went up, the quality of the food seems to have dropped as well as the expertise of cooking it.    The Chicken Parm that I got was pathetic to say the least.  It was a tiny little piece of chicken breast and was dry as a bone.  The side of spaghetti was even small.  It almost looked like a children's portion as they set the plate in front of me.    My wife and Dad both got the Mizithra Cheese...portion sizes were VERY noticeable between the 2 (She got a LOT more).  Sometimes you you get the Mitzithra Cheese with WAY more than you need...sometimes you get a lot less.    Service:  Well, it wasn't the best.  It took 20 minutes for anyone to come to the table...I had to go to the hostess and tell her that it's been 20 minutes and no one has even stopped by our table at all.  Once she showed up, it wasn't completely horrible.  The Old Spaghetti Factory used to be one of those places where you can go and meet up with the family for lunch/dinner and have good food as well as walk out of there full.  Their food used to be excellent and not taste like it came out of a microwave...or pre-cooked in bags like the Olive Garden.

Lived in the valley my entire life...never once been to Pete's.  A couple of my co-workers begged me to go.  They praised how good it was..even have the bumper sticker on the wall of their cubical.  Fish tacos were actually REALLY good and the burger was large for a 1/3lb.  I was quite impressed.  I'll be going back!

Oh so Yummy! Letter E lunch special!  I've been going to Al's for YEARS now.  They have some of the BEST Tex-Mex food anywhere!  Their chicken has *ALWAYS* been very moist and tasty.  I highly recommend trying them out!

Great food.  Great atmosphere.  We got an Olive Appetizer, a Cheese Plate, and Bruschetta (Brie & Apples with Fig Spread, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese, and Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese)  I got the "Nine Iron" Hickory smoked bacon layered with grilled chicken, fresh burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and dijonnaise  My wife and her friend split the Vegetarian Grilled asparagus, roasted artichokes, red onion, vine ripe tomatoes, goat cheese and house made pesto  And, of course, a bottle of wine.  We rolled out of there STUFFED to the gills!  We will be going back again soon!  There is one problem...if you don't like to give your car to a valet, then you have to walk...far.  On the good side, it's only $3 for valet.

HORRIBLE!!  I had to wait for my Spaghetti and Meatball stuffed Calzone!  They should have known I was coming!!!    The food was just as good as I remember from 2 years ago...maybe even better!  We had dinner there Saturday night and it's now Sunday and I'm drooling thinking about my leftovers in the fridge...That yummy, yummy, yummy sauce....mmmmmmmmmm.  OK, *burp* (excuse me) I'm back... mmmm that was good!   :(  Now I have no more left :(  Unfortunately, they don't have one in Chandler...I wonder if I can get Mr. Spinato to open up a 5th one out here! *hint* *hint*

Swimming pools... NOT CHEAP!  You find this out the hard way when you buy a foreclosed home!  Leslie's Pools have been great to me.  I've become "Norm" every time I go into there!  Phil (the manager) has been GREAT!  He has been EXTREMELY helpful (just short of coming out to the house and doing it for me). ;P

After reading these reviews, I almost felt that 5 stars was too much...then I thought back to dinner and remembered how excellent it was!  First of all, this was on a Saturday night and the restaurant was completely booked up with a wedding on the bottom half and a physician's dinner on top.  There were 100+ of us on top and the hor'dourves were that they served were excellent!  They even had a vegetarian one for my  wife!  My Favorite was the lobster casadia!  After drinks, they escorted us off the terrace and into the restaurant.    Appitizer: Crab Cake w/ lemon juice and some sweet sauce  YUMMMMMMMY! I would come back JUST for this!  (After living in Louisville, KY, it's been hard to find good food here in the valley. )  Salad: Arugula with strawberries, goat cheese and balsamic dressing.  Main Course: PERFECTLY cooked steak and sea bass with potatoes.   (Now, remember... FULL wedding below and 100+ people on top.. everything came out perfect...even my wife's vegetarian dishes.)  If you ever go to functions where they feed a LOT of people the same dish, you will find a lot of the time that the vegetarian dishes are usually a LOT better...in this case, it was the opposite!  (only because her food could have used some meat in it :) )

My Sister-in-law's mom forces her and my brother to take her to Knock Kneed Lobster every time she comes into town from Baltimore.  We met up with them .  2 piece fish and shrimp w/chips.  They even have pasta for the vegetarians!  The Mizithra Cheese Pasta was WAY WAY WAY better than The Spaghetti Factory!  We got a side of hush puppies...SOOOO YUMMY!    WAY WAY WAY better than Pete's Fish and Chips (which is still good).  There is only 1 problem ... no Diet Coke ....Pepsi products :(

Without the help of Yelpers we would have never found this place!  Everything made fresh...and to order.  The burger was great!  Wife's Gardenburger was the best she's had in a very long time.  She got jalapenos and they even had some kick (she thinks they were fresh).    It's a bit of a drive from South Chandler, but worth it.  We will be going back again!  We both agree it is worth the drive out to Lindsey & Broadway for a really good burger that is not from yet another chain!

Dim Sum mmm mmm  good!  My wife and I had to pretty much roll out of there...we ate WAY too much!  The biggest problem was that you keep ordering more and more as the carts roll by.  We've been back a few times for Dim Sum and will be going back again!

Just got home from eating there...  *****NEVER AGAIN!!*****  Service: POOR  Took 20 minutes to get Vegetable Spring Rolls to the table, and 30 seconds later came my Pad Thai.  8 minutes after that, my wife's Vegetable Curry came.  Food: POOR  Pad Thai:  Average (at best) flavor.  The shrimp may not have been fresh because they were awfully "fishy".  Vegetable Curry:  Flavorless (spice level 4 too!)   They don't even have Thai cooks...they are Mexican!  I don't want Thai people cooking my Mexican food either!

What the heck happened to PF Changs?  They used to be one of the best Chinese food places around!  Wife and I went there a few weeks ago and both vow to never return.  Her food had zero spice mine had double...had to send it back...after a 30+ minute wait on it the first time then another 15 the second.

FINALLY good Thai food *AND* good service!  We didn't have to wait 20 minutes for water/food!    Pineapple Curry was VERY good.  Lots of Pineapple, onion, and chicken.  Had a very good flavor (couldn't stop eating it).  Wife had the Pad Thai...had to send back because the Tofu wasn't fried.  Once she got it back it was "perfect".  The Pad Thai had just enough sauce to give it a nice flavor, but not too much to over power it.    We will be back for sure!!

Thankfully Sprint uses Franchises as well as their own corporate stores.  I STRONGLY suggest that *ANYONE* goes to a Franchise rather than the Corporate store!  I had an extremely unfortunate experience with the corporate store, but luckily found the owner of this Franchise who was very happy to help out.  The customer service he gave my wife and I made me come back to Sprint.  I was on my way over to another mobile provider and was going to also cancel my wife's service, but the owner of the store was VERY helpful and wanted to retain my wife's service and gain mine again.  I haven't had *ANY* problems with my service or phone since I started dealing with them.  I will never go to another Sprint store ... this is the one!

Had issues with my roller ball on my blackberry.  I took it in to this Sprint and they were able to fix it in just a few minutes!  This is one of the only repair places for Sprint that ACTUALLY repairs the phones...not just box and ship them somewhere else.  We plan on moving out of Chandler, but I *WILL* make the trip for any of my cell phone needs to this Sprint!

Got seated right away (had reservations) 20 mins to get drinks  25 mins after that to get cheese plate 25 mins after finished with cheese plate to get soup/salad 18 mins to get entree after finishing soup. Scallops came out cold.  They replaced it in less than 3 mins (food for me, bad for someone else).  Vegetarian option is 1 pasta dish or salad...no ability to make a veggie plate.    Really need better wait staff.  Doubt we will ever go back.

WOW!  Our friend, who we took to another Italian food restaurant the night before and was horrible, showed us up!    My wife and her friend got the "Homemade Ravioli alla Nina" ... WOW!  (nothing more needs to be said)  Veal Parmigiana with Spaghetti al Pomodoro (...I'm starting to drool thinking about it again!)  The Veal was sooooo tender almost didn't need a knife.  Their sauce was also EXCELLENT!  Spaghetti was cooked PERFECTLY!   After our bad experience, this is our new Italian restaurant!

mmmmmmmm steak sub mmmmmmmmmmmmmm  Sorry.. had to wipe the drool up.  Ok... The sub was VERY good and filling.  Pasta salad was excellent as well.  Very glad we tried Crazy Jim's vs the same old fast food crap that we normally get. One of my Co-workers got the Chicken Patra Sub and was very happy with his sub as well.    As someone else noted: the fries go to us "wet" by the time we got it back to the office.  I suggest going for the pasta salad!   We will be adding this to our weekly spot for lunches now!

Forgot my cell phone at home... decided that I needed it and some good Chinese food for lunch!  I'm not sure why Robert M. only gave it 4 stars if its "the best thing he's eaten all month."  The Express part is that they are setup like Kentucky Fried Panda (Panda Express), but they also have a long list of other stuff on their menu like any other Chinese restaurant.    There are only 2 negative things that I have found: 1.) The restaurant is setup more like a fast food or take out rather than a dine-in place so taking a date there probably isn't the best idea (other than take-out). 2.) Pepsi products! :P

Wow!  Food was GREAT!  Bean dip was ooohh soooo yummy!  Unfortunately for my wife, it has meat in the bean dip.  Salsa was very good.    Fresh Guacamole was really good too!  Baja Fish Tacos.. $.99 each on Wednesdays *AND* $1.50 Coronas too!  The fish tacos were grilled, not fried and came out PERFECT!  They came on corn tortillas and didn't need to be smothered in salsa or tarter sauce.    My wife got a Veggie burrito with some tomatillo sauce (had GREAT flavor).  She was VERY pleased!  The location of this place isn't in the best neighborhood, however the food is GREAT!

Not much more to say other than ****BEST MEXICAN FOOD IN TOWN****!   I've tried NUMEROUS other places.  Some were good, some made me ill. The only problem with Las Glorias is that they have ruined me for all the other ones. They are the "Gold Standard" for all of the rest.

Chas Roberts Plumbers are the BEST!  I had a minor emergency...well more major...the plumbing was backing up into the guest bathroom from the kitchen sink.  We called Chas and had them come out to unclog the sewer and found that the sewer lines had collapsed in 3 places.  They were able to put a new 3" sewer pipe through the old 4" clay pipe and save me from having to dig out my patio and pool deck!  I have since had them out to add a soft water loop, and new water heaters!

Unfortunately when you can't wait for your order to be shipped by NewEgg, you have to go to a place like Fry's.    Be *EXTREMELY* careful when buying something re-wrapped by a certified Fry's employee.  The equipment is sometimes re-stocked even if it's bad.  If it was an open box, chances are that it is missing some part as well.    The store feels like you're going into a dirty Walmart.  Don't eat anything dropped on the floor or give it back to your child without sterilizing it first!

I was searching for a Beretta M9A3 (calling about 20 local shops) and it turned out that they had one at S&S.  There was another dealer in North Phoenix who also had one, but was charging $50 over retail "supply and demand".  Alan, the owner of S&S, gave me a great deal on one because he wanted to earn my continued business.  Guess what...2 weeks later, my wife and I purchased 3 more guns from him!  Highly recommend if you're looking for SIG SAUER guns!  He knows the ins and outs of them!

I'm not sure if they changed something after reading horrible reviews, but it's a WHOLE lot different than when I was in there before.  Food was actually really good as was our waiter "Omar".  The fundito was really good...chicken was SUPER moist!  Fajitas were a bit on the veggie side (a LOT more veggies than steak), but still good too!

Salsa had no heat, not even the hot one.   food was flavorless and over cooked.   Service was horrendous.   Nothing to say good things about.   Vegetable fajita had no seasoning and tasted canned and greasy.   Fish fajitas also lacked seasoning and fish was cut into small pieces and treated as though thawed.   Guacamole tasted store bought.  Would not recommend

Happy Birthday to ME!  5 of us went there on Friday night... GREAT service and GREAT food.  Started off with some drinks while they got our table together.  After we sat down, we ordered a cheese plate, a dried and cured meat platter, and Italian meatballs to start.  Ordered a second cheese plate ...YUM!    After that, we were feeling very good and went all out...  Lobster Mac and Cheese Pork Schnitzel Angus sliders x2 Tuna Tacos x2 Crab and Avocado Sphere Hummus and Baba Ganoush Wild Mushroom Ragout Artichoke Barigoule  Those Tuna Tacos...wow...I am still craving them!    OK....getting REALLY full (but there is always room for dessert)!  Creme brulee trio Cheesecake lollipops Tiramisu  ...put a fork in me...I'm DONE!  I will (without question) be going back next time I'm in Vegas!

A very well hidden gem!  It was a chore to find this place (coming from the SR51), but once we did, we were happy to have found it!.    This place is hidden in the Ghetto, but the food is excellent!  My wife said that it was the best falafel she had had in a VERY long time.  The hummus was fresh and tasty.  The steak "sandwich" (which was a wrap)  The pita bread was awesome...  They have a meat and pastry counter in the back of the store...the baklava was soooo yummy!  ...oh and the portions are LARGE!!   4.5 stars!   -0.5 because of the location :P

Been going to this Chen & Wok for over 10 years now...their woks are VERY seasoned.  They have been in business for over 25 years and the food is great.  Friday nights...be prepared to wait a bit for the 10000 phone orders they get, but they will pump out the food fast and it's still very good!  Mushu Pork is my "go-to" dinner item there. Lunch specials are great too!    *WARNING* the food comes out HOT and Delicious!

Wife and I have been there twice now..Pad Thai was excellent as was the Massaman Curry!  The only problem we have had was the service...it took SOOOOO long for anyone to even come to the table.  The waitress was busy filling some large table's to-go boxes instead of waiting on other tables.  The sad part was that we filled our own to-go boxes.  Even after the not-so-great service, the food was good enough to come back for.

Lost 2 stars!  Sat in the restaurant for 15 minutes ... no waitress ... no water ... no nothing.  We left.  Sad part was there was people who left, then came back and got service before us.  The guy who came in after us got seated, hot tea and his order taken while we just sat and waited.  SERIOUSLY doubt we will be going back now.  If you have an hour or so to kill, you can wait for your food/service in there.

Do you ever want to go out for dinner but just can't decide on what you want or where you want to go???  Well, I think I have found that place to go for very good food.    The Pernil Asado (pork) was very moist and flavorfull.   My wife got the veggie enchiladas...all fresh veggies.  Cornbread caserole (with bacon), jalapeno cream corn, and chipolatle mashed potatoes were all great.    The portions were very big...had to roll is out!

Trader Joe's ... the hippy place.  hehe  Actually, the hippies have it right.  It's an excellent grocery store.  It's my wife's "Happy Place"...which means I go there :)  They even have free samples!  We moved away from the valley for a couple years and she made me drive an hour and a half (one way) to go to a Trader Joe's so she could stock up!  Their plants are very nice...we have like 800 orchids all over the house (she can't resist getting at least one every time we go).

Whats not to love about Costco?  Costco is the Target to Sam's Club's Walmart.  It's just cleaner and has a better feel.  The people are always helpful and if they don't have something you want, suggest it...they might order it for you.  The "Kirkland" brand is Costco's "house" brand.  The products are always of high quality.  They have an Excellent dog food  (Better than Iams).  Best of all if there is something you don't like...they will take it back without any issues.  If you're REALLY smart, you will get a business license from the state, and sign up for the Business Amex ... 5% cash back on gas!!  During the high prices, I was saving over $0.15 per gallon!!!

Unfortunately you can't give negative stars...or less than 1.    WORST SERVICE EVER!  Service my wife and I received was so bad that I decided to pay the $200 cancellation fee JUST to get away from them!  Both times my wife and I went in, we were forced to wait around and both times and was rudely greeted and "helped" by the manager.    I found out that this is a corporate Sprint store...they could care less if you're happy or not.  I even sent a nasty gram on Sprint's website and got an email back from an Executive VP advising that they were going to look in on this and fix the problems.

Server was EXTREMELY nice!  Food was very good.  My sister-in-law, who is both picky and EXTREMELY pregnant, loved it too!  The server was even nice enough to slide the table out so she could get into the booth :)  Buffalo and Kobe beef burgers were great!  My brother had some fish (with wassabi mayo) cleared his sinuses!!  We will be going back!

They say they are St. Louis BBQ... but their sauce is not.  It's a California based BBQ joint.  It, however, was surprisingly good!  It is not cheap, but also not really expensive.  Honey butter and biscuits were great!

Fish tacos were actually pretty good!  They were just a bit light on the sauce, but otherwise very good.  Also got the Deep Fried Onions/Zucchini.  Those were EXCELLENT!

Probably one of the best Gyros I've had in Phoenix!  What is also great is you can order from their website, pay for it and have it ready for you when you get there!  (Great for those of us with 30 min lunches).

*GAG*   Worst Italian food I've ever had!  Worse than Olive Garden!  Food was bland and over cooked.  Sad part is that Olive Garden was in the same parking lot.

"Welcome to Firehouse!"  (..as you walk in the door)  Subs were VERY good!  Very glad I ran across this place!  I've been back several times (unfortunately it's not very close to the house).  My car just seems to drive to Ray and the 101 around lunch time ... weird.

Schnitzel w/ Fries .... WOW that was good.  Got a Falafel appetizer... yum!!  Wife got a Cheese Bourekash which she barely let me have a bite of.  Israeli salad was very fresh and I didn't even get to finish it...it was finished for me.  Owner is very smart...he offers a lunch special..."free fountain drink when you pay cash."

Lunch was very good!  I had the Orange Chicken.  The chicken was crispy, and moist on the inside.  The crispy spinach was actually very good and helped give the dish some very nice flavor.    My friend had the Mongolian Beef.  Lots of flavor, nicely charred on the outside and moist on the inside.  This place is a higher quality Chinese restaurant.  It's not the cheapy Chinese food most people are used to getting.

I've only been there for their wine tastings....YUM!  They had a 5 course meal with 5 different bottles of wine.  They even made special arrangements for my wife since she's a vegetarian (and we didn't tell them ahead of time).  Her food was almost better than mine!  It was so good that we made reservations for their next one!

2 year anniversary last night...Tymn (our waiter) was GREAT!  Robert suggested a great bottle of wine (which we took one home too)!  My wife just told the chef to "surprise her"...which he did!     First Course: He made a fresh spinach, heirloom tomato and walnut pesto with scallions and bruschetta.    I had a salad with cayenne blue cheese and carmel corn and vinaigrette.   Second course: Udon salad with honey cayenne praline cashews and schezuan vinaigrette.  I had the ostrich with pesto fresh mozzarella cheese heirloom tomatoes.    Third course: Wild Mushroom couscous with walnuts and truffle oil.  I had the Opah with a crab bisque and Udon noodles.

First of all ... Amazing food.    The Edamame is by far one of the best ones I've ever had!  You have to try the "The Famous, One and Only, "What's In This Steak". "  My suggestion is to get a half order of it then another half order of something like the scallops or one of the fish dishes.

Upscale Thai food.  The restaurant is very nice and clean.  The owner came by and made sure that we were happy with our meals.  My wife and her friend got the Tofu spring rolls.  They said they were very good.  The "peanut sauce" didn't taste like peanut butter (which is very good) and had a nice bite to it too.  Yellow curry with Tofu (uber spiced) was very good as was her friend's eggplant (also uber spiced).  My Musaman Short Rib had GREAT flavor...only problem is that there wasn't more :)

HOLE-IN-THE-WALL!  This place is itty-bitty-tinnie-winnie.  However they pump out HUGE flavor!  The pizza is, by far, the best in the area (that I have had)!  If you're a thin crust fan, you will love their pizza!  The toppings were all VERY fresh and plentiful!

I have 3 words.....  SAME DAY SERVICE!  ...AND it's only $2.00 (with coupon).  The owners are both EXTREMELY nice and helpful.  They even have an "after hours" drop off program so you don't have to go there during normal hours (if you forget).  I will now ONLY go to Del Ray!

OMG I'm gonna be sick!  Yeah... True, it's a kitchen, but not so sure on the "food" part.  The food was EXTREMELY bland and without flavor and in smallish portions.  Nothing that we had at our table was ever worth going back for.  This was a few months ago when we went, but we won't be going back!

Been there several times now.  So much that the waitress gives me a hard time (in jest).  She knows that I want a Diet Coke and Spicy Garlic Green Beans appetizer.   My wife and I have had a large selection of their menu and have yet to find anything not good.    They now have a BYOB (Bring Your Own Bottle) policy.

Trying out a new restaurant on Valentine's Day is not something I would normally recommend...especially in the neighborhood of 12th st between Thomas and McDowell (at night).  However, we had a GREAT experience!    The restaurant was an old home with a lot of modern flair.  The tables were spaced out well (so you weren't packed in like sardines in a can).  With reservations, they pull out the scrabble tiles and spell out your name (what a neat touch)!  Everything from the food, to the service, to the bartender (who can actually mix drinks), and even to the manager who was very nice and helpful.  Highly recommend the Cheese Curds, Poutine, and the Red Beans and Rice!  I am fairly certain that we will be going back again...and soon!

My Jack Russell wasn't eating and we got worried.  We took him to the vet (got an appointment the same day).  The staff was very helpful and caring.    The Vet couldn't find anything wrong with the little guy, so we ran a test...unfortunately the doc couldn't dig any "presents" out so they gave me a little vile and told me to get a "sample".    My wife immediately says "he's your dog...you do it."  YAY ME ... not.  After taking the dogs out for a couple walks to get him to finally go...I had the unfortunate job of "getting the sample".  Thankfully they didn't find anything wrong with him and the very next day he started eating again.

This place is BUSY!!  Every time I drive by, there are a TON of people in there.  When you go in you stand in line like at Sauce and order at the counter and get a number for your table.  My high hopes for this place started to go away when it started to feel like a chain restaurant with the same boring food pumped out to the masses...   Happily I can say I was wrong.  They use fresh ingredients by local AZ businesses!  I'm happy to support local business and will be coming back here again!   Costa Breakfast Burrito: Spicy chorizo, bacon, cheese, & scrambled hash brown.  ... WOW!  The flavors are incredible!!  This was easily one of the best breakfast burritos I have ever had!

Grilled Cheese was EXCELLENT!!!  Of course there was a MOUND of bacon on the grilled cheese!  My wife got some veggie thing (as usual) and liked it as well.    The manager walked around the restaurant so I told him about Yelp and his reviews.  He said that he has only been there for a couple weeks now and has cleaned house.  He was really upset to see the bad reviews and invites people back to try it again.    Next time we are in the area, we will be sure to go there for brunch again!

3 words for the Chapman Mazda Service Department:  BAIT AND SWITCH! I purchased a brand new Mazda a few years back and have gotten all of my maintainces done by them.  With the purchase of my new CX-9, I got LIFETIME Oil Changes for $10!  What a great deal!  I know that by going to the dealership they will find new and ingenious ways to bring that cost up by finding things wrong with it.  I was fine with that.    HOWEVER...when I went in on Saturday morning, they found no other things to fix.  Great.  I go to pay for it and it's $36+.  This is nearly 4 times the cost of my $10 LIFETIME Oil Change.  I was told by the service writer that they got rid of that plan and no longer honor it.    Needless to say, I will no longer be going to the dealership to purchase anything or get my repairs done there.  Also, I will not be buying another Mazda because of this.

4.5 stars  We had some really good Empanadas with Guava and Cream Cheese... WOW!  They were very good and sweet!  I had the Ropa Vieja (#31) (Shredded beef, bell peppers, onions, and Creole sofrito, in a savory sauce) with a side of Moros (White rice that is cooked with black beans and topped with sautéed garlic and oil).  My wife had the  Frijoles Negros (black bean soup with white rice on the side) and Yuca Frita (Fried yuca wedges).  Both of hers were very good too!   We both WAY over ate!   We met the owners of the restaurant and found out that they have only been here for 2 months and now have their liquor license.  We will be going back!

This is our new go-to place to buy unique jewelry and to have jewelry/watches fixed/adjusted.  The owners are great...very friendly and knowledgeable.  They have AMAZING prices (wholesale, not retail).  They have everything from low-end stuff to high-end.  If you're looking for something special, they will find it and get it for you!    I definitely recommend you check them out!

2 words... HOLY CRAP!! The pizza was AMAZING!!  As was the garlic cheese bread!!!  I got the Brooklyn Bomber (Pepperoni, Sausage, Meatball, Bacon, Ham and Garlic) pizza and my wife got the Veggie (Tomato, olives, Feta, and mushrooms) pizza.  Both were EXTREMELY good AND they weren't all icky greasy like many others pizza joints.    While we were there another customer came in and got the Chicken Shawarma Wrap with a side of Tzatziki that was freshly made.  He raved how good it was and how much he would be going back to try all the other stuff they had as well.   WITHOUT QUESTION....we will be going back there!!  It's just a little hole in the wall pizza joint, but they have HUGE flavors and GREAT prices on their pizzas for all the ASU students!

FRESH FRESH FRESH!!  EVERYTHING IS FRESH!  I spoke with the owner and he was telling me that he made his own pita bread as well.  The food was GREAT (as usual).  We had hummus, cheese bread, and a huge bowl of fresh Taziki sauce.    My wife ordered the Crispy Penne and added mushrooms, I had the Calzone with Pepperoni, Sausage, Meatball, Bacon, Ham and Garlic, and our friend with us had just a Pepperoni Calzone.  We rolled out of there stuffed with LOTS to take home!

This was one of the better Mexican food restaurants I've been to in Phoenix.  We did go on Monday (when they first opened) so the service was kinda "meh".  However, the food was very good.  This is Mexican food, not TexMex.  It's not like Valle Luna (which is good that they aren't).  It's been rough finding GOOD Mexican food in the Phoenix area.  mmm Chips and dip... their salsas were really good... not full of vinegar.  Their "hot" has good flavor, but isn't so hot you can't eat it.  Bean dip was REALLY good too!  Their chips were good and weren't oily either.    They have a **H U G E** menu...  The Carne Asada was really good!  It's a sirloin steak topped with green chiles. Garnished with guacamole. Served with chile relleno.  Probably one of the best I've had in Phoenix.  My wife got the spinach and cheese enchilada verde.  It came out with 2 friends... (3 of them). They have their special sour cream (onion flavored).  It was very good too!

Worst and Best car wash I've ever gotten. And here's why...  I went on Saturday morning about 11am and finally got out of there about 40 minutes later. I was in lane 3 (the REALLY SLOW lane). I expect that if it's taking a LONG time, maybe I'm getting extra care and a great wash. I was wrong. I finally get out of there and as I'm leaving and pulling out onto Bell Rd I notice that my dash wasn't even wiped down.   I quickly came back and spoke with Rich (white shirt) and he took care of it and made it the best wash I have ever gotten from Danny's. He found LOTS of issues and made sure that I was happy with my wash. He said that he would be having a discussion about quality control with them the next day at their meeting.   As a former Danny's employee, I know that sometimes you get really backed up and want to get through them quickly, but you have to remember that the customer is paying for this service and, in most cases, tipping on top of it so the quality needs to be as high as possible.  Because of Rich, I will be back!

WOW!  A COMPLETE AND UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT!  My wife and I had been bragging on how GREAT this restaurant was to our friends and how they are going to LOVE it!  We brought a couple of our friends (one from out of state) and had some of the worst service and food that we have had.    The service was so bad that she didn't even take drink orders... we had to flag her down to get them.  The Filet and Shrimp...  For $18.50 you expect a nice steak and some shrimp... She got 2 wafer thin cardboard cutouts of steak and 4 shrimp.  The shrimp weren't bad, but the steak was horrible.  They replaced the steak with a piece of grilled chicken (cut up).  Our other friend got Spaghetti...She rated it as worse than High School cafeteria food.  At least in High School you know what you're going to get.  She said that the pasta was mush.  I got the Baked RigaTony...normally very good... it was very wet and half of the noodles were soggy and the other half were "ok".   My wife's was the same.  The server did try to argue with us about the meal, but we asked for a manager.  The manager did comp the 2 meals and give us some coupons to go back, but I'm not sure if I want to risk that again after that!

1 star for the food, and an additional star for the cheese plate and service.  The food was HORRIBLE!  Pizza sauce tasted like it came out of a can!  The pasta was under cooked (some pieces were crunchy).  The waiter even said that is exactly how he got his when he had it too.  He knew it was under cooked as well.  Also, the food was fairly over priced (especially for what you got)... the $1.00 frozen pizzas had LOTS more flavor than the margarita pizza (and better sauce)!

Food was very good.  We did the Mozzarella Platter.  They actually make the mozzarella at the table with the cheese curd. They add in flavored salts, balsamic vinegar, and oil if you want.  They made a special veggie plate for my wife and my steak was great!  Drinks were nice and strong as well.

I don't eat mushrooms due to my mom forcing them down my throat while I was a kid.  I actually tasted it and ate the whole thing!  If my wife reads this or anyone else... you can call her and ask for yourself! :)

I really can't say enough about how good this place is. Unfortunately they don't pay me for reviews in money or free food. I really just want to let everyone know how good it is so they can continue to produce great food at reasonable prices. I can honestly say that I have never had anything bad here or just "meh". Ninos (the owner) has done a great job making sure the food that he puts out is the same day after day. I love this place!   If you're sick, his soups are great for that too!

As someone what had literally tried everything on the menu, I can assure you the food is great!  Try something new!  If you don't like it, they will replace it for you.    Their food is high quality  (I even saw the food delivery guy order some for himself).  It's really worth the stop!

We went last weekend for dinner.  We got a table outside right away and they were fairly quick at taking our drink order.  Then we didn't see our waiter for 20+ minutes.  We flagged down another waiter and he re-took our order because the other one forgot what we ordered.    We finally got our drinks and our pretzel order (which was really good).  We ordered a couple Poutines, but they were very sparse on the cheese curds and the gravy was WAY thin.  The vegetarian version of the Poutine didn't have a gravy (they could easily come up with a mushroom gravy...or even buy it from Trader Joes).   The brussels sprouts were good, as was the burger.  I will probably give them another chance in a few weeks and hopefully they will have everything figured out by then.  It's really nice having a micro brewery close to the house!

According to my wife,  who claims Tennessee as home,  the southern fare is delightful.   Hush puppies, NOTHING like Long John silvers', were superb and the buttermilk dressing brought her back to the south (had to order a second batch because they were so good).  The fried green tomatoes treated as though they came off Beale street in Memphis. Real chef...not premade crap out of a bag.   Service was great too.  A new favorite for sure!

Ok... been there 4 times now and finally getting around to writing a review.  This is now my new favorite BBQ place in town...and not too far from my office!  Chopped Brisket and Pulled Pork are my favorite, however, I tried the Hot Links today and they were very good as well!  One thing to try is their boneless rib sandwich (on special)...AMAZING!  Unfortunately, it's not an everyday item.  Maybe if enough of us request it, it will be one day ;)
