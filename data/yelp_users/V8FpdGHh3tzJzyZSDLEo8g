Tried Tott's for the first time last night with my mom. We ordered over the phone and the guy taking our order was very friendly and polite. Picked up the food and it was waiting for us when we got there.  The crab puffs were a little heavy and greasy for our taste. The egg drop soup was delicious - lots of egg! The chow mein also had a lot of vegetables, which I loved! The orange chicken was okay; a little soggy. My mom liked the beef and broccoli, but didn't really have anything to say about it (pretty average). Portion sizes were great and I had my leftovers for lunch today. I would order from here again, especially for the mein!

I walked into this small establishment with a craving for my usual - a skinny, decaf iced vanilla latte. I wasn't greeted coming in the door and was surprised to hear no music playing. Had four customers in front of me, which wasn't much compared to what I am used to, and the barista at the register was happily taking orders from those who seemed to be regulars. However, I quickly noticed the energy in the room was dead and their baristas moved like molasses in December. It took me 15 minutes to get my drink and when I got it, the coffee tasted burnt and bitter. The only saving grace was the sweet barista at the register. Sorry, Starbucks, in the future, I'll find a different location.

I love Yogurtland! They always have awesome flavors and a good selection of toppings. The prices are great and the eating areas are kept clean. Definitely a favorite for a light and sweet dessert!
