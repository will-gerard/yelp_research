Don't even bother coming here. This was supposed to be the future of McDonald's. Kiosks where you could order your food and not interact with people. But unfortunately that did not happen. The people behind the counter looks like they shouldn't even be here and They don't want to be here. Why the hell are they getting paid $15 an hour? But the new building is nice but that's not a good enough reason to come and actually get food.

The woman behind the counter was very slow and seemed like she didn't want to be alive and she was very rude.  But not a rude as the woman who threw my cup onto my tray. Not placed, not tossed, but threw it on my tray.

Being a former employee of sonic I know how busy it can get. But there is something to be said when you can't even get a simple Sunday out to a customer in 15 minutes. Especially when there's only three other cars in the lot at 10 o'clock at night. And to make things worse not even an apology for the wait time.

I took my mom here for her birthday dinner cause its where she wanted to go and we havent been there in a while.  I don't know if it was the over burnt roast beef, the under cooked chicken, or the shoe leather they tried to pass off as steak, but coming back here after 8 months left a very bad taste in my mouth. My family and I use to come here all the time when I was younger and the food was great, the atmosphere was wonderful and the staff was very friendly.  This use to be the place to be, now I would gladly spend the extra $3 and waist the gas to go to a different golden buffet (Golden Corral).  Do not waist your time and money on this place anymore, Trust me I won't.  I would rather eat out of the dumpster behind Taco Bell than ever eat at this Hometown buffet again.  You have lost a lifetime customer, and anytime your name comes up in conversation, I may just puke.

I went to this location for the first time today. In fact it was my first time ever having the conveyor belt sushi experience. I must say with the very reasonable prices ($1-$3 per plate), the variety of food, and the wonderful atmosphere, this place is quite possibly my new favorite restaurant. I'm going to be eating here maybe once a week from here on out. You will definitely not be disappointed with the quality of food at this place as well. Try this out at least once, you will be very happy you did.

Over the past couple months I've walked by this location several times and it always seems to be closed literally it just seems like everybody just vanished from this location. All the stuff is still inside but there are no employees I know cupcakes to be seen. There are still posters in the windows but a paper towel taped to the front door that just reads closed in pen. Does anybody know what happened?

I am so happy this location opened up.  It's so close to home and honestly better than any other pizza place I have ever been too.  The serious slices are as big as a new born baby and taste like GOD himself kneaded the dough.  I would recommend this place to any and everyone I meet.

I came to this location about a week ago just on a whim. I love revolving sushi bars and I'm always up for a new experience and my favorite revolving sushi bars is about 15 miles away from my house so seeing another revolving sushi bar in my area I decided why not. The atmosphere was nice, but that's about where all the good things end.   I started off by ordering in iced green tea and I grabbed one of my favorite types of sushi the Philly roll. The cream cheese in this role was the majority of the role. The cream cheese overtook the flavor of everything else. Next I grabbed some at a edamame which was thoroughly undercooked and pre-salted. I personally don't mind having the salt on there but I know some people wouldn't like it salted. I'm sure you could ask for it unsalted but at a revolving sushi bar it's all about getting it from the conveyor belt. Next I tried a Las Vegas roll which had no flavor whatsoever. Next was a tuna roll and the tuna tasted like it was dropped on the floor. At this Time I asked the waitress where the restrooms were and they were all the way on the other side of the restaurant which you literally had to go through a maze to get to. After spending about two minutes in the restroom I came back and my place was already given to another customer. If it wasn't for the fact that I consider myself to be a good person I would've walked out without paying.  When it comes to revolving sushi bars do not waste your time at this location. I will continue spending my money and enjoying Teharu sushi in Tempe rather than go to this place again.

Being a patron of the old Camelview I was pleased to hear that they weren't closing for good just moving to a new location with an updated feel to it. Being in the new section of the Scottsdale fashion center, I expected it to be very beautiful. And from the moment you pass into that area it is breathtaking. From the ticket booth to the lobby and everything in between it is simply one of the best new Harkins that I have seen. That being said I do have a problem with the seats. Being how Harkins is very late to the game on the new comfortable reclining seats I would think that they would be the best that I have ever sat in. Boy was I wrong, and in a very painful way. Not only where the seats very uncomfortable but the leg supports were too short (and I'm only 5'10", my fiancé is 5'3" and even her legs were dangling off) and I had to keep my head tilted forward to see the new Star Wars movie in 3-D leaving such a crick in my neck. It was very difficult to find a comfortable position that my fiancé and I could sit in. The only thing that Harkins did right with the seats is that they are all interconnected so you don't have to worry about which two seats you reserve. But when it comes to comfort of the seats I would rather go to Cinemark or AMC. Mind you this review is only for this theater, I have been a long time patron of Harkins theaters ever since I was a child, and I will never stop going to Harkins, mostly because they have the best popcorn at any movie theater that I've been to and some of the best prices when it comes to tickets and concessions. But if I'm looking for a relaxed evening where I can sit comfortably in a reclining movie theater chair I'm going to go to the Cinemark. Sorry Harkins but you really missed the mark on this one.
