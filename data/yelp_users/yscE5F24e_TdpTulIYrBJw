My wife has a massage room on site here and I always enjoy the lovely smells that come from this shop. The family owned business has been around since we've been here (9 years) and they are always super friendly to me. I Know I have a unique perspective because of my wife's story, but they are always nice and seem to have the store under control, not to mention they love what they do there !

I always enjoy my local Rubios. They know us by name and always greet us with a smile ! Their phone etiquette can use a little work, but the cleanliness and friendly staff make up for it. Not to mention their food is always GOOD !!

I am a member here at their Men's Club and I enjoy this course very much. As a 1.1 Index golfer it still poses challenges and the greens are always in great shape !

The biggest Whole foods I've ever seen ! Always VERY HELPFUL (and sometimes humorous) staff here. Food is always fresh and I don't wait in line very long, IF EVER  !

the staff here is not enjoying their work. It feels too much like a factory assembly line here in here. SMILE PEOPLE ! Life's too short to be miserable.
