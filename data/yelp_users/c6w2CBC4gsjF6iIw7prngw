You can't go wrong with the chile relleno, chicken, or breakfast burritos. I can't believe there isn't a review of this place up yet. The horchata isn't as good as La Tolteca's, but you can't walk to La Tolteca from Palo Verde at 2 in the morning, and it wouldn't even be open anyhow. My 5 stars take into consideration the price (extremely cheap), service (always solid, not exceptional, but generally friendly at a minimum), and cleanliness (may look grubby, but I've never gotten sick).   I don't think the jukebox works.  The chips with guacamole are decent (they come with a mountain of shredded cheddar) but only if you add some red salsa.  LITTLE KNOWN SECRET ALERT: free chips at lunchtime (could be weekdays only). Do it.

I had a chicken chimichanga because it was their $5 lunch special. In retrospect, I should have ordered something else that would have challenged the place more. At this point, I feel like I've visited my fair share of -ertos restaurants in Phoenix, and I should have known better to get chicken + tortilla + sauce + sour cream + token cabbage instead of something more complex and interesting.   There is no reason to go to Nico's when there is a Filiberto's down the street. I might consider going back if I was trapped on the corner of Southern and McClintock, starving, and if I had eaten at that little deli place next to Sunflower Market every day for a year, and I was allergic to Long John Silver's.  It's not that bad, just nothing special. And no salsa bar!

Courtney was my second shooter for a wedding in Phoenix last year, and I have known her for several years since we collaborated on some student photojournalism projects. She's got a great business sense and an even better eye, and will treat you with professionalism, respect, and honesty.   One of the best things about good photographers is that they are open to new techniques and bring an open mind along with all of their expensive camera gear. Courtney is a great example of this - she soaks up photography knowledge like nobody else and you'll see fantastic new stuff on her blog almost constantly. See for yourself!
