I knew it was too good to be true when I was lured into a cheap plane ticket from Phoenix to Vegas. After I go through their multitude of fees, my ticket was the same as Southwest, but I had to drive an hour from my house to their tiny little airport instead of 10 mins to Sky Harbor. Then we get here, and our flight is delayed FOR FOUR HOURS!!!  Really Allegiant? With not so nch as an "I'm sorry" from the crew either. In fact ALL crew members left the building so they didn't have to answer any questions. No comps, no drinks, no service. Never ever again will I fly this airline, and I will tell everyone in my life and in my social media circles to avoid this worthless airline at all costs. Buyer beware!

I had an air conditioner condenser line leak on the very first day I moved into my new home.  The leak damaged my wood floors.  I called Dave at McAll's Air Conditioning and Heating, and he came right over (it was after 7PM).  Dave quickly identified the problem and was able to fix it on site.  He was very reasonably priced and is helping me pay him through my insurance claim,  I highly recommend McAll's Air Conditioning and Heating.
