I've almost exclusively purchased dress clothes here since my first suits. They have the best selection and an expert staff, so it's disappointing to have to write a less than stellar review for this Men's Wearhouse.  I went to get a jacket and a pair of pants tailored earlier this week and had a couple of issues. First was getting hassled about exchanging a gift for the next size down without a receipt. I then found out it would take 7 days to get two simple alterations done. Between this and a less than friendly cashier, The overall customer experience was less than satisfactory. I called after 5 days to see if they had maybe gotten my alterations done early (by their standards) and they said they would check and call me back. I never got a call back. I would still consider going back to Men's Wearhouse, but will try to find a more hometown place with a better customer experience before I do.

To be brief and allow you to make your own opinion on how Brendi H served us tonight I'll just transcribe the dialogue between her and I and her and my colleague that I was sitting next to.  My colleague ordering an appetizer Colleague - "I'd like the Formaggi i Salumi"  Brendi - "Would you like the Proscuitto and Tres Leches?"  C - "Is it included?"  B - "Yes"  C - "Sure thank you"  When she received her bill she would find out those two items were each $5 and not included Disclosure: the menu itself doesn't hide that they are $5 supplements  Myself ordering dinner Myself - "I'd like the voodoo penne"  Brendi - "Would you like the arugula or house salad?"  M - "Sure" (I didn't hear the 'or' and for whatever reason I thought maybe the house salad was made with arugula)  B - "Which one?"  M - "oh sorry, I'll have the arugula"  This is a $12 salad and I didn't enjoy it much.  By the time I was halfway through the salad it had got around the table to me that she deceived me into thinking it was included because she got a few others at the table too.  What she said to my colleague was a lie and what she said to me was deceitful and I will make sure my team does not have dinners here anymore. The only reason I didn't give one star is because every time I have a large group that needs a recommendation in Tempe this place is accompanying and has good food but what happened with Brendi is very unfortunate.

Sherri, a master stylist here, not only gives me exceptional haircuts, she has guided me on a life changing journey. A while back I set out on a journey many men have set out on but see too  many obstacles to finish. This is a journey of freedom, commitment, and persistence. If you're a guy reading this, you many have embarked on such a journey. The man bun. What is generally 12-18 months of an awkward stage, Sherri mitigated very well with her expertise and consulted me on managing this process throughout. Her glowing personality and outgoing spirit always makes for great conversations as well. No matter what kind of hair related service or specialties you're looking for, I would recommend her to anyone.

Club Sar in simplest terms is a place that fosters a purposeful, active, and positive lifestyle among your Scottsdale peers. If you're looking for some premium health club that you can show off that new lululemon jumpsuit in a crossfit class, get the F out of here! This is a blue collar gritty old boxing gym where the people of Scottsdale want to sculp their bodies and minds into the strong purposeful temple they've always dreamed of. So if you want to have "THE BEST DAY EVER" as Jonathan, the fitness guru and comedian on staff always says, get your booty in this place. You won't regret it.

I just had AZ BBQ for the first time because one of my roommates eats there enough to apparently get his picture put on the wall with the rest of the regulars. Take that for what you will for him personally, but it's just that kind of place which I appreciate.   I had a hop knot IPA, a tri tip sandwich per recommendation, and green beans. Tri tip was kind of thinly sliced/shredded and well coated with BBQ sauce, and I will pass on that recommendation to you. Green beans were very good as well. They had these thinly sliced pieces of some kind of bacon or cured meat of some sort (if you know what it is let me know). Ambiance and overall experience wasn't anything special but it's a good meal served by good people so I'll be back in a week.
