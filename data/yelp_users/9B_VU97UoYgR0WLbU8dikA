I have been getting Mystic Spray Tans here for over a year and am very pleased! Staff are always very friendly and welcoming and Celebrity Tanning is one of the only places in town with the Mystic HD booths. (Google it to find out the advantages) I don't do the membership but make sure to always buy the deals such as buy 5 get 1 free or any of the Groupon Deals they run.

Best Vegetable Curry I've ever had! I opted for the yellow curry and was really impressed by how much flavor it had and just the right level of spicy. I wouldn't say it's the least expensive spot but worth a couple extra bucks in my opinion. Definitely going back!

Any chance I have to make it to Liberty Market with friends I will! I love this place! They make a fantastic cup of coffee and amazing panini sandwiches. I particularly like the array of vegetarian options since I don't eat meat. As a garlic lover I can't get enough of their garlic hummus! Oh yea, and yes the bathrooms are indeed very cool. :)

I hate writing bad reviews but I wasn't very impressed with this place for the prices they charge. :( All was not lost though since I had printed out a coupon from their website for 20% off. The pedicure stations don't have massage chairs and I didn't think my manicure was as clean and nice as it could have been. The lady who did my nails was super nice but I don't think I'll be returning to Total Bliss unless it's for a different kind of service.

The cleaning ladies are very nice and professional. I feel at ease having them in my home. They also are very dependable and punctual!

Space Age Lodge is a comical and obscure spot to stop in during a road trip. However, if you are vegetarian, skip it. The only thing on the menu I could order was a very greasy quesadilla.

Simply one of my fave restaurants in the valley! The servers are always really friendly and the menu is delish!! I love the ambiance and modern decor. You must check out their amazing martinis and wine selection as well. If you haven't been here you need to!!

One of my favorite restaurants in the valley! I'm vegetarian and I've never had a dish there I didn't like. They have a huge menu and a great wine selection. (The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the seating area is somewhat small and they don't do anything special for birthdays.)

Oregano's never disappoints! Great service and amazing food as usual! I'm vegetarian and but can appreciate very good Italian food! My fave dishes are the Bruschetta, Veggie Wedgie sandwich and the O-Riva pizza. They have fairly nice patio seating which I appreciate as well! If you've never experienced Oregano's I suggest you get your butt over there asap! (Wishing they had better drink specials though)

I was pretty impressed by this place! Their prices are really great and I loved my vegetarian curry dish I ordered for take-out! It tasted fresh and reminded me a more authentic and less expensive version of Pei Wei.

I had great customer services up until the $75 tri-shorts I bought I discovered were too big for me. I tried to return them the very next day (desperately hoping for an exception) and they would not honor a return or exchange since I had taken the tags off. They have lost my business forever due to the return policy.  Update: I did understand the return policy when I purchased the shorts. They were very upfront with me regarding the policy. This doesn't change my decision to go elsewhere to a place that is more helpful when a purchase does not work out. It is a great place to shop if you are 100% positive about the item(s) you need but as a newbie to Triathlons I suffered the consequences.

This is my home away from home! I love my personal trainer (Patricia Rose) and the metabolic specialist helping me with my zone training (Mark Wagner). The Life Spa offers superb services that I would pay for anywhere else but love the convenience of it being right there in the gym! I can't say enough about the food in the Cafe...yummy! And great vegetarian options! The protein shakes are a little spendy but very delicious. Paying a few extra bucks for a resort feel gym is well worth it to me!

My friends and had dinner here before our movie that AMC in the same complex and the food was phenomenal! It was kinda dead due to the odd time of day we visited but the service was awesome. I wish I could remember our servers name but she really seemed to know a lot about the dishes and care about her job. We partook in the $4.95 mojitos which were yummy too!   PS: We used a restaurant.com coupon too! :)

Every time I go somewhere else to get my nails done I kick myself for not just going to Pink Polish. It's a bit further than I like to drive but TOTALLY worth it. They do the best job on pedicures and Shellac manicures I've ever seen and very reasonably priced. I'm sure you can find cheaper places but you're going to get lesser quality. Let's put it this way....if I was getting married tomorrow I'd get my nails done here today!  My favorite ladies to ask for are V or Libby!

I usually try to schedule with Julia when getting a brow wax because she's awesome. I've gone to many places for this services and she ranks right up there with the best. I also have had a massage that was amazing. I'm a Massage Envy member but it's worth it to me to spend the extra money to get one at Life Spa once in a while.   I wasn't a fan of the pedicure I received there and felt that the pedicure chair was in a really awkward "closet" type area. I hate to say something negative because I love this place but I probably won't go for that service again.   It's worth mentioning that the front desk ladies are very helpful and friendly.

Had a phenomenal facial with Julia! I haven't felt that pampered and relaxed in a long time! Julia really pays attention to detail and it's clear she's very educated and good at determining what your individual skincare needs are. I completely trust her to decide what to do with my skin when I arrive. In addition she's very personable and makes you feel like you're a good friend of hers. Can't wait to schedule again with her!

Close to my house, fresh tasting rolls/sushi, chill atmosphere and cheap saki bombers on Thursdays! I love this place!   Also, they have pictures of most everything on the menu which is REALLY helpful when choosing from their selection!

I really like this spot! The atmosphere is really unique and chic! My friends and I had a blast exploring the crazy mirrored hallways upstairs and "glass floor" in the elevator shaft. Great cocktails that I haven't been able to get anywhere else and the food is fantastic as well!

I was happy with the friendly service at the counter and the speedy wash. I particularly happy with their hours as they close at 6pm and most places close around 6 during this time of year. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I can always nit-pick places they missed in the interior, but that's going to be most places. Overall good experience!

I love this place! I'm vegetarian and get the Falafal wrap at least a couple times a month. I love the it's a smal privately owned place and every staff member has made me feel like a valued customer.

Great spot for fellow vegetarians! I had the vegetable rolls app and the vegetable curry and both were very fresh and full of flavor!  I LOVE that they have online ordering for take-out too. (Use promo code NEWGRUBR for $5 your first online order over $10.)

My favorite sandwich place in the valley! I LOVE the veggie turkey sub because it comes with vegetarian deli turkey slices and I don't know of any other place where this is available. A vegetarians dream come true!

I went a couple weeks ago and I'm really excited about the Gilbert Farmer's Market expanding! I bought some delicious Kalamata Olive Hummus and some Fire Roasted salsa! I'm anxious to start buying more fruits and veggies from them in the future!

If you like getting spa treatments (and who doesn't) then it's silly not to stay up to date with the specials and reviews AZ Spa Girls offers. Make sure to subscribe to their newsletter and "like" them on Facebook. I've been able to take advantage of amazing steals for massages, gel manicures and B-12 shots.

Really yummy sandwiches and cute modern decore! Perfect for lunch take-out as it's pretty small with only 5 tables inside. Love the Grilled Veggie and Goat Cheese sandwich as well as the Caprese sandwich. Didn't think I'd like the Blue Cheese Cole Slaw side because I don't care for mayonaise but it was delicious!

It seems that Two Drops has had some issues with their start up particularly with the scheduling of clients. My guess is that the overwhelming Groupon response has caused some chaos and the management just wasn't prepared for the traffic. However, I booked my appointments in advance and have a pretty good experience there. Rosario is the one who has done my facials and she's very personable and sweet. I appreciate good "bed side manner" at med spas so I like her very much. Hopefully Two Drops of Beauty can continue to progress organizationally and get more positive feedback.

I was introduced to Bikram Yoga at this studio after buying a coupon deal online. Though I can't say that I'm in love with Bikram or Hot Yoga, this was a GREAT place to try it out and get your first feel for it. The staff were very accommodating and helpful to a newbie like me and I felt very comfortable and welcomed the whole way through!

For an establishment that markets being fresh and healthy I'm shocked by the limited vegetarian options. It's really close to my house so I go sometimes for lunch or just a beer on the patio. But I really wish they'd up the game on the menu.

My small group and I wanted to check out something new with a patio. And boy did the Vue deliver! Fantastic outdoor seating! I had trouble finding items to accommodate my difficult vegan gluten free dietary restrictions but Chris (GM) went above and beyond to help me out. He got an idea of what I like and had the kitchen literally invent some delicious bruschetta bites for me. Wow! The guys at the table tried the watermelon smoked wings and were impressed by how good they were! We will absolutely be back to enjoy the patio, amazing service and good food!

I'm super picky about who does my nails and this place is quality. I had never done the powder dip nails and now I don't think I can ever go back to gel. I can't believe how strong my nails are!
