I will never come here agen. The girl that took my order was illiterate. Had to repeat myself multiple. She was not professional at all talking in slang to the point were she could not be understood at all and trust me I know slang. Then she forgot my ice coffee that I orderd. She then proceed to make the coffee but I had no idea what she was doing or how much of creamer/ caramel to put into the cup. Another employ had to stop and shower her what to do eventually he took over and made my coffee him self. This whole process  was way to time consuming. I will not be returning here to any location. Much better off going to your competitor Starbucks and Dutch Bros.

I said I would never come here agen because of the horrible services I received last time. However my bf wanted to come here because he likes your sandwitches. So I agreed to tagging along. The gentleman in front of use walked out out and said to use befor he left that he had been waiting for over 10min and not one of the employs had acknowledged . being that we were very hungry and had not eaten breakfast we decided that we would wait still. We the only people in line waited another 8min. Not one of your employs said hello, we will be with you in a minute, we were not acknowledged at all. It was like we were not even there. Iv had horrible service before this was beyond that.

Considering the location I thought this would be a good breakfast place. Sadly I was mistake. The Restaurant smells dirty. There hole staff is ghetto and trash. They have employs wearing street cloths were our food was being cooked. No one was wearing hair net's and some employs were not even wearing gloves wall handeling food. All employees were loudly talking about drinking, partying, and other inappropriate things.  The food it's self was alright for the price you pay.

This is by far the worst mexican food I have ever had. The bacon in my burrito was raw for starters. There carne asada with more like dog food. The smothered chimichanga I ordered had no sauce what so ever and the side of sour cream was spoiled smelt like it had been sitting out on the counter for a week. This place need the health inspector called on them

This place never disappoints me. Last time I went there a small mistake was made, when I call to notify them about it they went out of their way to fix it. They gave me a free blunt of my chose. I chose the Luke Skywalker loaded banana peppers spicy mayo lettuce tomatoes onions jalapenos all that good stuff. Literally the best sandwich I've had I've ate at five star restaurants that charge $25 for the sandwich $8.59 sandwich blows the rest out of the water. There stafd always so friendly and has awsome ideas to add t9 your sandwitch to blow it out of the water. I come here at lest onces a week with my man Keep up the good work. The manager at the location on souther and between Dobson and Alma School always makes a pleasant experience sorry I forgot your name but but he he's black hair wears a benie. Yall need to give him a rasie.

This place is delicious. Kinda stumbled on it. I just move to west mesa erea ans it's wright across the street from my house. The first time I got the black pepper chicken and the mongolian beef. The meat was unbelievable tender had the right amount of vegtibals and sause. You get a lot of meat for the price. The 2nd time I got the bbq  beef and fried rice with shrimp, chicken and pork.  This place is going to be a regular spot for me and my boyfriend

The health spring juices they have are amazing I got with kale apple cucumber and lemon. Drank the who thing in minutes I highly recommend that drink. I also got the egg Benedict I forgot the name but it has mushrooms, spinach, onions, baccon crumbs with holiday sasue also came with a side of potatoes. Which was also amazing I also added a slices of ham for $5 more.  Their service was okay nothingness exceptional that definitely was not bad.  Their you play your bill up front after the waiter drops it off at your table. Ones she sat the bill on the table we were still their finishing up our meals. Like we were forgotten about. Also your plates are every small. It's hard to cut you food because their is no room the food falls off the plate.

I would not have given them any stars but had to so I could wright this review.  Waited up front for over 25min to get some tools unlocked so my bf and I would purchase them. Their was no employees any were walked up and down the aisle and still could not find any. I guess they all go on brake at the same time. After waiting a total of 30 min then all of a sudden their was 4 people back working. But then again the store is located in mesa so you shouldn't expect much customer service when the people are only  making 8.50.

Last week- I have eat here once befor and it was exceptional Great food awsome flavor and nice staff. I thought coming back to this amazing place would be a good idea but boy was I wrong. The women. Who took my order was not professional, friendly or helpfull. I ordered a pizza with BBQ sauce, cheese, pinapple, jalape√±os, bacon, sausage and ham. I was wanting a sweat and spicy pizza. That's not what I received. They completely forgot the ham and took it apon them self to add mushrooms and zucchini. With those two added food items it through off the whole taste of the pizza. I could only have a few bits before I throw my slices away. I ordered this pizza four my office. I was ranting ans raving about how fantastic your pizza is. Every one was wanting Me to order from giant rustic pizza but I convince them streets of new York was better. We all were let down. I nor any CO workers will be ordering from you.

I got one of their promotional coupons which is the only reason why I went in there. In the past I have not been a big fan of Chipotle. I got a burrito bowl me and my boyfriend got a burrito. Omg it was so yumi. I love the fact that their GMO free and antibiotic-free this is definitely enough to make me come back for more. Plus all their employees are supper nice. Great customer service from whom ever was at the check out at 2:20 today !

My boyfriend and I wanted to try something new so we though we would give this place a try my mom's always saying it's pretty good here. Sadly we were very dissapointed. The place was pretty much empty so we though we would get timely service boy were we mistaken. It took over 45min  to get our food. Our server  never came back to fill our drinks I had to track down another server for that. In fact our server never returned to our table till our food was ready witch is funny because the white couple sitting next to use saw her several time with in 20min. When our food did come out she completely forgot our appetizer. When we reminded here she rudely ask ""uuu so do you still want that".  Both of our stakes were over cook I got a medium rare it was more of a medium. My by got a medium and it was well done. The only good thing about our experience was the tie died I drink which was delicious. Mallory was our server

This is by far the worst dealership I have been to. I have had problems here my last visit but we're able to clear them up. How ever after today I will never be coming back here agen. My appointment was at 12:30 I sat in there car line for over 25min befor I was even acknowledged by an employee.  When he finely did come up to me he asked for my name I gave it to him. He came back 5min latter to tell me that he doesn't see my name for appointments today, witch is impossible because I made it yesterday to get a new tire because mine has a nail in it. Needless to say that employees didint offer any solution to the problem didint ask why I was here or get someone in management to see were this mistake was made. In fact that employ never came back to my car just pretend like there was not problem at all. I waited about another 15min on top of the 30min I already waited. No one came up to me agen. So I got out of my car and asked to speck with a manager it's been 15min and still no manager. I walked to the sells department and asked to speck with a manager there I was told no and to go back to the service department. I have never been so neglected and disrespected at any customer service/delership. I will never return to this location or any other one for that matter. I will be telling all my friends family and co-workers about my horrible experience and that they should never come here etheir. I was planing to buy my 2014 toyota corolla at the end of my Lee's bur I will not be any more. I want nothing to do with a money hungry business who dose not care and treat there cutomers they way I have been treated. I have know waited an hour no manager no solution and I have to drive away to another  tire to another shop so that I will be able to drive my car safly.

I've eaten here numerous times with coworkers and I'm very disappointed in the food we got. My coworker and I ordered the chicken and hummus and when we returned back to the office, we were very upset to find there was hardly any hummus, it looked like someone scooped and slatted a small amount of hummus, and forgot the pine nuts, tomato and our chicken was cold. I wish I could rely on them for a quick healthy lunch but I will not be returning for the price and quality of food rendered.

Lets start off with i Love dutch bros. Laney I belive her name took mine and two other Co workers order. She was very friendly and talkative gave good recommends on drinks that our off the menue. Not sure what she made me but it was delish!!! Best drink that I have had there. My co-worker got two drinks but for what ever reason there machine was not able to read her card. She also tryed  the one we're you scan he card on the phone and it still was not reading her card. Because of the small inconvenience Laney comped both my friends drinks with out any hesitation or complaints from use. Will be coming back to this location only!! Thanks for the awsome service Laney made our day !!

The greater who sat out table was not friendly at all. Was alot more welcoming to the white family in front of us. Our server was on top of it. Our drinks were never empty. She was very friendly. Our food was okeay but our fries were cold when they came out and waited quite a while for our food to come out for an empty restaurant. When we told the waiter that they were cold she offered to bring new ones out. But by the time we got them we are already full from a mill. I like chili but we will not  be coming back

This is the shit !! I work at the dental office right next door so I Come here often for lunch. Iv only gotten cheeseburgers there. Every one I have tryed is awsome. The sweet and spicy is by far the best cheeseburger I have ever tasted at a burger joint. I get this every time know. The burgers are Huge and FULL of flavor. And a dark and stormy drink to the meal to top it off can I say yumii. It's a lil pricy for what you get in my opinion but like I said everything is delicious so I don't mind sending money there.

I come here because it's right next to my work. I normally always get the sweet and spicy burger witch I'd awsome!!  This time i was dissatisfied. The burger had almost no jalape√±os witch made for a very bland flavor if any at all. Better off going to in and out at lest they have consistency.

The first time I came here I got one of there combos. Bacon, sausage, eggs, biscuits and gravy the whole bit. After I eat almost  half the mean I noticed there was hair in my food. I brought this to there attention and they acted nonchalant and no resolution.   Today I decided to give them a second chances with my bf. He got the French tost meal witch was okeay. I got the country fried chicken witch was repulsive. All it was, was a ground meat patty that was fried. Had absolutely no flavor was basically like eating cardboard. Then we waited over 25 minutes to receive our check after eating our food. We will never be coming here again and we are for sure going to tell  friends and family kn about our horrible experience and also will never come back  here agen.  FYI -after eating at this horrible place I got food poisoning. Spent hours laying in bed and throwing up. DO NOT GO HERE !!

LOVE THIS PLACE !! The staff is awsome. Always friendly to everyone. I don't even need to order, they know me so well they already know what I am going to want. They are supper fast. The longest I have ever waited was about 3min and they were slammed. There coffee has a distinct flavor which I love. When you get expresso shots you can actually taste them. They prices are great cheaper than then Starbucks.

My boyfriend and I decided to give this place another try. Let me start off by saying our waitress Glenda just started here. She very friendly and good with people. Very attentive our drinks were never empty. She checked on our table the prefect amount of times not to little not to less. I did not like my soup and she changed it out at no charge. Then our steaks came out. My boyfriend got the parmesan crusted steak and thought it was okeay.  I got the jalapenos steak and ordered it medium however when it came out it was well done. Glenda got me a new steak and the manager tony comped my meal. People should learn from tony he has the best customer service. I have seen and experienced myself

My bf and I came here. The srvices was horrible. They messed both of our burgers. I got one with two kinds of cheese, mushrroms, banana peppers with everything bread. The only thing they remember was banana peppers everything else was wrong. I sent my burger back twice and still couldn't get it wright. They also forgot my bfs cheese and added a bunch of stuff he didn't even order. Some girl with short hair was no help at all was kinda rude. I could also see other people around us sending their food back too.

So lett me start by saying I love this place I come here all the time.  Today I forgot my card but had a roll of quarters. I told him this and apologize in advance. They told me to save my change that this meal was on them. The owner and his employees are genuinely kind people. Always make you feel at home with their upbeat and positive vibes.   You have to try the fish/torta can you say                       AMAZING seriously it's mouth watering!!

The flavor was awsome. The employee are really nice. Definitely stands our from other ice cream places. Only reason I gave them a low rating is because their was hair in my ice cream.  employees with long hair should have to where in a ponytail or up.

My boy friend and I stopped by here because it's close to our houses and looked good. Staff was friendly. It took FOREVER for our food to be ready. They brought out our fries fist. We finished them befor our burgers got to use. Then they made my bfs  burger  wrong. Took another 10min for it to come out on top of the 25min we waited for our  food original. I finished me meal befor he got his. For as long as we waited we could have gone some were nice.  Was  a nice experiment  but we will not be coming back.

When I first arrived I ordered and mango margarita which was amazing it tasted just like a mango. On the downside I didn't see my waiter for over 25 minutes I had to  stop two other employees before she ever come back to my table. There was only 3 other parties besides myself so I could understand if they were busy but they weren't. She never told me her name but she was the only whiter server with blond hair.  Drinks amazing 100% Her service 10%  All the other servers that I was watching were very attentive to their tables. I might go back but I would request not to have her.
