We got there at 8:11 and didn't leave until 10:30 because it took the waiter at least 5 times to get Everyones order right. It took probably until almost 10:00 for everyone to get their food. Only reason I give it 2 stars is because the sushi was great and I got it after a reasonable amount of time. I would only go back here to sit at the sushi bar because they were good and the sushi chefs looked like a good time to have conversations while you eat.

Don't get me wrong. I love Pei Wei. Great service, delicious food. I'm giving a 2-star review for one reason. I ordered online and went to pick up. I received a meal with chicken instead of what I had ordered, which was a shrimp dish. I'm writing this review to remind you to check your order as you pick it up. Don't get home and find a wrong order in your bag! And Pei Wei, please get the order right so that my brother, who is vegetarian, doesn't have to take out all the chicken from his plate!

Very good sushi! The Vegas roll and golden state roll were the best!  I would recommend this place, just be careful what sushi you order because a few roles come with only 5 pieces and are sorta expensive. Oh and if you want a tasty spicy roll get the Tiger's Eye Roll. I could keep naming rolls but you get the idea!

Screen was broken. Took it in and a few hours later told me the costs. $180 for the new screen, $100 for the labor. Pricey from my perspective, and someone told me I should have just gotten a new laptop, but we'll see in the long run if I made the right choice (hope this laptop lasts a while longer)!   Long story short, new screen is beautiful, and computer working fine! They even checked to see if I needed a new spyware protection, which I did! The service was done within  the week. Good job RED7

This is my first time coming to this particular Jiffy Lube. Read the recommendations of coming to this one instead of the one down the street. The Jiffy Lube on 67th ave and Bell is my go to place for an oil change from here on out! Great customer service, quick service, didn't oversell. Thanks Jiffy Lube!

Best sushi I have had so far! So many to choose from!! Spicy tuna, Vegas, Philly, Hot Lava, Shrimp Tempura, Fire Dragon; the list goes on! Seriously don't be hesitant to try the variety because you won't want to stop! And for lunch specials, I've been there twice for lunch and ate 2 rolls for the price of one! Sweet success. Try this place soon!

So 3 years since this review and I've been to a lot of good sushi places in Tempe, Scottsdale, North Phx, Glendale, and downtown...Hon Machi is my go to place in Chandler.

Either we caught them on a bad night or maybe my expectations were too high. At any rate, food was not too flavorful and very greasy. The noodles with minced pork had good reviews, and what I had did not match up with those reviews. Dumplings and egg rolls were delicious though. I may try again in the future, but will order something different.

I wish I could give this place more stars. But a place with the word "Burgers" in it led me to setting high expectations for the burger I ordered. Thank goodness for my big appetite that day because I ordered the regular burger and a chili dog.   The chili dog was spot on! The burger, cold and not much to it. Maybe I should have sent it back, but I hate being wasteful, so I ate it. But sadly that made me not want to order a burger there again for a long time. I'll give it another chance someday because of high rating.

Went on yelp before coming here to see if it was a bust..not a bust! If you didn't know I am a sushi lover! Me and my brother came here before his Lasik eye appointment..and Oh. My. Goodness. Delicious! We were most impressed by the spicy yellow tail. And cannot believe how cheap it was during happy hour! Can't wait to be in the area again just to go here again.

Make sure you make your way here! Great service, incredible food, and very Mom & Pop feel. The meatball appetizer was delicious, and can't go wrong with any of the pizzas here. I would definitely come back here, and soon!
