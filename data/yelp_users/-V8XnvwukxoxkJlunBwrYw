The office staff is awful. I hate moving and really don't want to deal with the hassle when my lease is up but I also don't want to deal with them.  They are simply just rude and act inconvenienced any time you call (it's your job to help me!!) the apartments are mediocre at best but the location is nice. It's unfortunate they don't have better staff as I'm sure they will be losing renters if they continue this way.

Lex was great and it wasn't nearly as bad as I expected.  She's patient, makes it comfortable, and asks what you need.  Definitely will come back.
