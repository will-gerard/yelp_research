At this point I'm regretting my decision to switch from Big-O to Discount Tire.  Yes, their prices were lower and yes, their sales staff are very helpful and friendly.  I am sitting in the lobby trying to get a warranty repair looking at my car sitting in the same spot I left it over 2 hours ago.  Still hasn't been fixed.  This is getting ridiculous.  What good is a warranty if you can't get it done in a timely fashion?   For a simple tire repair, Big-O always had me in and out in under 30 minutes.  I may have to go back when these tires wear out just for the conscience of the repair time.

This was my first time eating at the Fogo de Chao in Scottsdale and it might be the last.  I have eaten at the Fogo de Chao in Dallas many times so I knew what to expect, amazing service and perfectly cooked and seasoned meat.  For the $30 you will spend on lunch, you should not expect anything less. As I walked in, I was not disappointed.  Everything was first class.  The salad bar was just as you would expect in a five star steakhouse.  I learned from previous visits not to waste too much time at the salad bar.  I came for the meat, cooked Brazilian style, and I was hungry. As soon as I sat down, I flipped my card to "green", which signals that I was ready for meat.  "Red" means stop bringing meat.  I didn't really care what came to me first; I knew it would all be delicious.  As luck would have it, the first "gaucho", Portuguese for cowboy, to come by had one of my favorites; top sirloin.  My mouth was watering as he sliced off two big pieces from the rotisserie skewer.  This is where the fantasy of what I was expecting ends and reality set in.  The meat was dry and rather bland.  What!  This had never happened to me at this restaurant before.  Of the dozens of times I had eaten in Dallas, the food was always perfect and top notch.  The Scottsdale Fogo de Chao was turning out to be a disappointment. I thought to myself that I simply had one bad cut of meat and it was bound to happen sooner or later.  I tried the filet mignon, the lamb, the chicken and the pork.  They were all dry and flavorless.  The only thing that made spending $30 on lunch worth it was the fabulous meat, yet what they were serving was not even as good at Texas Roadhouse. I'm sure that one day I will go back and give them another chance.  Every day that passes I convince myself that it wasn't as bad as it was.  As soon as my memory fades enough, I'll be back for at least one more try.  Besides, it is too much fun to drop a bread crumb on the table and watch the headwaiter scramble to come clean it up.

I have purchased 2 bikes from these guys. They are nice guys and will give you a reasonable deal.  Except for the one time that I showed up 5 minutes before closing to get a new tube and the door was already locked (with people still inside), they have always treated me fair and were very helpful.  I would recommend them if you are in need of a quality bike.

Just had my teeth cleaned at Boyse Dentistry in Mesa (Dobson & Baseline). It was probably the most comprehensive, professional, and thorough exam I have ever had. I was really impressed with the staff and Dr. Boyce. I highly recommend this office for anyone who is looking for a great dentist. This is NOT one of those offices where you are pushed through like cattle. The Dr. doesn't cut corners. His staff are exceptional people. I can't say enough. Two thumbs up!!!
