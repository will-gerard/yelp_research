This place was pretty tasty, especially because my chorizo breakfast burrito was only $3.99.   This place isn't the most fancy, but it was clean and the food seemed to be made with good quality ingredients.

This place is pretty cool. It's a real chill atmosphere and there aren't an overwhelming amount of people there (which I like!).  I showed up to meet some friends on a Friday night. The inside is great, there is a big horse, a small stage, and a bar maned by a fun staff. The decor isn't fancy, but it has character. A band was setting up getting ready to play. I would have loved to hear them, but my friends were outside so I headed there.  Outside there is a big patio. It was a little chilly, so there was a fire goin' in the firepit. There was also a musician outside, so I wasn't missing out on entertainment. She was playing calm, folk acoustic, making the mood of the night even better.  The group of 7 that I was with were able to sit comfortably, there was plenty of room. We enjoyed good conversation over the music and weren't bothered by wanna-be types trying to be cool. All of the customers and staff there seemed very down to earth.  Great atmosphere, decent prices, and cool people.

All I can say is, I really hope this place was having a bad day. I was really hoping this place would be good. I loved their sign out front and was hoping for a new place to go...but I guess not.  When you first walk in, there is no real clear direction as to where you go to order. I walked up to where they were making sandwiches for another customer and stood there. There were two people behind the counter making sandwiches. One left to ring a customer up and came back. All along, for the 5 minutes I was standing there, nobody said "we'll be right with you", "Hello", nothing. I didn't even get eye contact, but I suppose that would have meant they would have had to say something.  I finally got an "Are you ready?", which as a side note I thought was somewhat rude. You can't even give me a "Hello. How may I help you?" Just an "Are you ready?" as if I had been making him wait a long time before making my decision. No... I was waiting on you. But I digress. I ordered and decided to get my sandwich to go because the environment wasn't much to look at and it felt claustrophobic.  The food meh and made with what seemed like bagged bread. You can look at my photos to see what I got. I think they speak for themselves.

Yum! The food at all Oregano's is always delicious and I'd have to say the same about this location. Both the food and service is good here. It is very consistent with other locations.  It also is consistent with most other locations in parking - or lack there of. Unfortunately, this is just something you have to take with most locations.  Otherwise, great place to go! You can usually get two meals out of your entree, too!

Hmm...I wouldn't say this is the best meal I've ever had and paying $30 for a mediocre meal isn't my idea of a good time.   The night started with a socially awkward waiter, who wasn't a bad server exactly, but it just made the mid-meal interruptions more noticeable.  I got some pad thai and the best thing was the sauce. I can say I thought it was pretty decent, but the rest was meh.. The chicken was dry, the tofu was more chewy than tofu should be....but the worst part! is that my noodles were not good!! It's a NOODLE cafe!   Might be for some people, but it's not for me.

Wow. One of the worst meals I've had in awhile.  My husband and I came here for some Chicken Fried Steak because he went about 3 years ago and said it was awesome. We showed up and knew that we wanted to order the Chicken Fried Steak right away. They took our order, we waited shortly and our salad came out. Wasn't the best salad. Wasn't really fresh..had a lot of ranch on it, but I can see how somebody might like it. Ate some of it and pushed it to the side.  Soon our steak arrived. I was so excited to try it! I took my first bite and was shocked to find that it was completely bland. I added some salt and ate some more. The meat wasn't the best, which I understand because it's chicken fried steak, however it tasted frozen to me. After the 4th bite, I had to ask my husband if it tasted the same as before. He shook his head no and commented on how disguising it was. Even the mashed potatoes were bland. I agreed and started to feel gross thinking about eating any more of it.    We both pushed out dishes to the side, with lots of food still left on our plate. When our waitress came by about 10 minutes after she dropped the food off, we told her we were done. She asked if we wanted a box, which we declined, but otherwise no questions or concerns - she didn't even seem to notice that we ate almost nothing off of our plates. Didn't feel like bringing it up at the time, so we just paid our $35 for and left. I hate KFC and I would much sooner eat that than eat here again..

This is a great lunch place, I go here frequently. The food is always good, and as long as you go at lunch, you don't have to pay tip! My favorite order is the spartan club and the pesto fries, yum!  The staff is nice enough, have never had any problems (including the time I spilled a whole glass of water on the table/floor). The atmosphere is ok, not exactly my taste but very typical for a Greek restaurant. The seating outside is awesome on a cool day.

Hava Java is a great place to go if you're looking to quickly grab something to go or even if you are looking for a fun place to hang out. The staff is always very nice and work efficiently! I always get an Americano which has great flavor.   Love the atmosphere - especially when the weather permits openings the sliding doors in the front.

A great sit down restaurant where the food is delicious, the staff is nice and the prices are awesome.  It's the type of place that serves delicious, neighborhood style food. The flavors are wonderful. It's one of those places that start you off with hot tea, which I love! The lunch specials are super cheap. You can probably eat here for less that some place like Panda Express and you'll get better food!  The other things about Chinese restaurants in the decor. Usually it is 80s-esque decor with a pastel palette, luckily this place isn't like that. Hey, it's still not New York Chic, but it's not a disaster either.

This is a fairly good home depot. It has a lot of construction type materials and I have heard it is the biggest home depot in Arizona. The only problem with the store itself is that sometimes it doesn't have as much "home decor" (lighting options, window treatment, etc) type items as other home depots I've been to.   The staff is usually fairly nice and knowledgeable. The rental department seems to have lots of options, which can be good for the bigger jobs around the house. The parking lot isn't the best, but that's not really their fault. I've had a few interesting incidents there, but none related to the store.

I generally enjoy eating at Einstein's. It's a good tasting, quick, and fairly priced meal. The shmears are good, the bagels are fresh, and the sandwiches are filling. So, I must let you know this review applies only to this Einstein's.  I've come here quite a few times, but finally decided to write a review because I'm sick of the mistakes - it needs to be said. At any fast(ish) food restaurant, there is always an expectation of some mistakes being made on your food. But when those mistakes are continually made and cost you extra money...you start getting fed up.  I've had certain staff members screw up my order every time they make it. This is very frustrating, especially when you order cream-cheese (at something like $1.50 extra..which is kinda ridiculous in the first place) and you don't get it with your food, it's infuriating. When you often get your food to go, you don't realize until you reach your destination and it is too late by then. You always have to check your order after leaving Taco Bell, but I thought Einsteins was a little higher than that - apparently not this one.  However, there is one shining star - Cathrin. If everybody made your order as quickly or perfectly as her, this place would be getting a much higher rating from me.  So, if you are going to this location, I warn you. Some of the employees don't pay attention.

I don't get this place..I seriously think I could go to the store, get the same type of ingredients and make a similar sandwich for less money. I know there are lots of different sandwiches here that you can try. I suppose I prefer a place that has a select few sandwiches that are really good opposed to a lot of choices with ok flavor.  The bread is seriously the cheap kind you can get at the store. It comes with a cookie which doesn't taste like anything special. Lots of people like it here and I can't say anything really...negative happened. I just won't be back.

I love Baker Nursery! Their selection of plants is superb and the plants always look fresh. The staff is always very nice and helpful. And I love the atmosphere...sounds weird for a nursery, but it is very homey. It is as if you are walking into somebody's back yard...which is almost true. I believe that the house next door is the owner's property.  I remember my mother bringing me here as a child - I always had so much fun there. She brought me here because she also used to go there as a child! Baker's has been around for so long and is a wonderful family business. You should go check it out!

This place is great! I've bought more than a few items here.   There is always a good selection of items and the best part.. THERE ISN'T CHEESY CRAFT CRAP! I'm one of the people that gets irritated when I see these types of things in an antique store. It isn't a craft store..it's a place for OLD things.   Their selection of OLD items is great and their prices are decent. The staff is always really nice and they are open on Sundays, which can be a rarity in Antique stores. I don't think this place is cluttered, I think it is laid out well. If you are looking for something in particular, the staff is very knowledgeable about what items are in the store. Overall great place to go!

Over the years that I've antiqued in PHX, I've started to add this place to one of my favorites. The staff always is always nice to me and I've found quite a few fantastic pieces for my house. The prices seem reasonable and there's a couple booths that always have something fun to look at.

I was honestly surprised by how many wonderful pieces and history this place had. I wasn't sure what to expect since Florence is a small town, but I believe that this museum is better than some in Phoenix.  There were lots of really old, wonderful and odd things. One of the most unique of the pieces are the ropes that were used to hang people in Arizona. There is also a sock monkey from Winnie Ruth Judd. Don't be alarmed by my interest in darker items, there are also items of lighter subject - glasses that have turned purple from the sun, clothes, etc.  One of my highly recommended Arizona stops.

This used to be my FAVORITE place. I used to be able to find various hidden treasures for a good price. I got a few mid-century-esque pieces without breaking the bank. Yes, they had a scratch here or there, but they looks great in my house. Plus, Saturdays are half off, making weekend treasure hunts an every week event.  However things have changed recently.. There seems to be a new employee who has started in the past 6 months. She seems to think that all the items there are SOOO amazing and prices them way to high for what you are getting. The furniture still has scratches or dings or needs to be cleaned up, you can't charge like it is new. You are a tiny, local shop. You have to price accordingly. I've even seen IKEA items priced like new. People give you things for FREE..it only seems fair to me that you wouldn't try to rape people with your pricing.  I've been putting off my review because I wanted to give them a good review, but things just keep getting worse.   Sad. No more weekly stops here for me.

I can't believe I haven't wrote a review for Ted's yet! By far, one of my favorite places to go. You can get full off of some tasty food for a great price. I normally get a hot dog with mayo, onion, hot sauce and a pickle. I also like the corn dog and onion rings. I can always get a satisfying and fulfilling meal for $5-7. Love it!  Can get a little crowded on the weekends, but generally all the people are pretty fast and nice.

I went here long ago with my school when I was a kid who couldn't care less about history, but I was finally able to come here as an adult to get the full experience. I loved the old building and was happy that they have kept a lot of the original details. Not all of the exhibits were that interesting - but I still learned a thing or two about AZ and it's history. Definitely recommend coming here at least once as an adult if you are interested in Arizona history and old buildings!

I love LOVE love Brass Armadillo!  Although this is somewhat of a drive from my house, it is always worth it. Every once in a while you can always find a good deal for a spectacular, unique item. And even if you don't, there is always interesting things to look at.  The people are usually pretty nice and it's fairly clean. I've never eaten at the cafe, but I'm not sure I would. Looks like it wouldn't be great....but everything else seems good!

This place is pretty amazing. I've been here a few times for breakfast (I have yet to try lunch) and get the white flannel hash or they're monkey cakes (I believe that's what they are called).   It is always delicious. It is usually not too crowded and I enjoy the atmosphere. They're coffee and drinks are pretty delicious too.   I would have given this 5 stars, but the last time I went, the service was horrible. The few times I had been before, I had never gotten this. Perhaps they were short staffed.

This place is more like a museum than an antique shop. There is definitely a fair amount of $7,000+ items in this place, which makes it a great place to look around, but a horrible place to shop. However, it if possible to find a decent priced item here or there.

I love this place. It is one of my favorite Antique shops in the city! There is a wide selection and variety of booths and items. There is everything here from match boxes, cute purses and hats to retro/vintage furniture, wacky mannequins, old cameras and old toys to reminiscence over. And! They are decently priced and have a nice helpful staff.

What can I say? Dilly's Deli is a classic in the Tempe area. Awesome place to get a delicious sandwich for a descent price and be able to get in and out fairly quickly.  I personally like the gobbler. Great taste of Thanksgiving without the "I ate WAY too much" feeling.

This place is delicious and cheap!  We don't live in Tempe, so we don't get to come here often, but when we do it is a treat!  We always get the marylou (which is a quesadilla type appetizer) with a side of sour cream and share! It's plenty of food for a meal and it all comes out to less than $15!  Yea, the interior design isn't unique and the place isn't spotless...but it's been around for at least 10+ years! What can you expect from an old building?  I'm just sayin'... if you're looking for some good, cheap and authentic Mexican food, La Fonda is where it is at.

I love, love, LOVE the items here. The furniture is the best part - there are lots of great items that I would to love to have in my house, however it is usually too pricey for me.  They have some really cute clothes and they have local artwork which is awesome. The owner and her cats are nice. Overall, fun place to go!

I honestly don't understand what all the hype about Delux is about. I honestly prefer Fez.   The meat is supposed to be this amazing, specially raised beef - that's all good, but could you maybe add some flavor/spice to it? I'm not sure they even added salt. Besides that, my bun was soaked with juice. Really? I've never even got that at Burger King.   The one positive thing I have to say, is that the atmosphere is pretty cool and they are open late. BUT..even though they are open late..it's not enough for me to go there even when late-night options are slim.

Mamma Mia might be the best tasting and cheapest New York style pizza in town! You can get two slices of cheese pizza and a drink for $3.50 while still satiating your craving for delicious pizza. They also serve an array of other good foods (sandwiches, wings, cannoli..mmm, etc.), but one of the best of the other dishes is the vodka penne pasta that pretty much melts in your mouth.  The staff is really nice and the owner is a cool guy. They always bring the food out quickly and the quality of their food doesn't waver. So...try them today!

This place has great food, great service, great atmosphere...but a crappy wait.   I love eating at Matt's, but I don't go as frequently as I would like because of the wait. I think the food is better than most, they use fresh ingredients from the farmers market down the way, which always improves food quality.  Some people don't like the size of the restaurant, but I love it! It wouldn't be as fun and intimate if it were bigger. I have had Matt's a few times, but today I went at 6:40 (10 minutes after they open) and it was incredible. There was no line and no people, making the feel of a "small breakfast joint" feel real. It was calm, quiet, wonderful and reminded me to write a review! So, if you're an early bird and can get there around opening time, I highly recommend it! Otherwise, it's good, but prepared to wait while sipping on some yummy grapefruit water.

This is a really great library and probably the best in Phoenix! Among the beautiful architectural elements, this place has a pretty descent selection of books and music. There are different levels of the building that gives a great separation. There are lots of areas that allow you to sit a read all the different books. There is also a really cool teenager room that provides a cool hangout for all the young folks. Haven't had any bad experiences yet. Overall a great place to go!

When going vintage/antique browsing around the Melrose area, Qcumberz is a must on our shopping journey.  Qcumberz always offers great items at reasonable prices (which is sometimes hard to find in that area). At times, it can be a little crowded in there (from all the stuff), but that's what I love about it. There is always so much to look at and I think the layout adds to the atmosphere.  Oh! One of the most important things, and I almost forgot! The parking situation can be confusing. The parking lot is directly in front of the store and that is it. If you don't park there, you may find yourself confused and wondering why there is a lady is telling you there are other options while handing you a pink pamphlet with a fetus on it. If this is the case, you have arrived in the "Planned Parenthood" parking lot and need to move.

If I could give this place zero stars, I would, but I was forced to give one. My husband and a few friends used to come to this place every week on Tuesday night for Trivia. Every night, we would order food and at least one of us would drink.  Recently, we showed up for our normal trivia night and upon asking what I wanted to drink I said water. It was cinco de mayo and I was probably going to have a drink, but hadn't made a choice yet. The waitress then told me that they are only serving bottled water after five now.  WHAT? YOU WON'T SERVE ME WATER?  I didn't get irritated at the waitress, she didn't make the rules we just wanted to talk to the manager.  While waiting for the manager another tabled ordered water and were told the same thing. They also wanted to speak with the manager.The manager visited their table first and we listened in. After talking with them for a bit he said, "Well one of your party has ordered 3 margaritas, it's ok for you to get water. From now on whenever you guys come in you can have water."  The manager then finished his conversation and came to visit us. He talked with us about how he didn't like people coming to trivia and just ordering water. (That is completely understandable) However, when I told him the situation of us being frequent visitors and that we always ordered food, he didn't seem to care. He asked if we were sitting in the same area last week and I replied yes. He then mentioned how he noticed we were drinking water and said this is a bar, you can't order food and get free water.  We then walked out.     This bar does not serve you free water AND on top of that, their food is not that good and overpriced.

One of my favorite parks that I've been to! There are two areas, small and big. I have a small dog so I go into the little dog park. The running room in this area is much more limited than the big dog area, but that's ok - it seems to be enough room for the little ones. There is a water faucet to fill up water bowls and allow your dogs to cool off.  One of my favorite features are the trees! It's a mature park and the trees are gorgeous. They provide lots of shade and make for a relaxing soundtrack.   This is one of the furthest parks from my house, but I always make the trek out there just to come here.

If there's one thing I like to do, it's start my morning off with an old fashioned! QTs donuts are by far the best I've had - particularly the old fashioned. I'd tell you to try one, but that means you'd probably be the dick that takes the last one so there is none left for me. So...try another type!  Like most QTs, this one has all the great things that most QTs have. Their food is usually fresh and their drink selection is good. Nice staff, clean premises. Overall good place to go!

I love Bertha's. I admit, when I first came to Bertha's, I wasn't sure it was 5-star worthy. Mainly because my personality causes me to be skeptical of what everybody says is so awesome, however, I went again and found that I started craving the food there. Now I am a regular and you can usually find me there on Saturday morning enjoying my delicious breakfast wrap (which is one of my favorite by far).   There are lots of delicious choices - The Thai Chicken Wrap, Salami Pesto Goat Cheese, and the Roast Turkey are my most frequents. All of the bakery items are delicious. I love the cookie that always comes with the lunch sandwiches! So good!  The staff is always wonderful and very friendly. The whole experience is always great.

I have to say, this is probably one of the nicest Safeway stores I have ever been to. One of it's shining features is their deli department. It's a great place to stop for lunch. On the spot, they can make you salad, pizza and sandwiches or you can get one of their well made deli items.  Plus, the staff is always really nice here and the store always seem really clean.

This place is great. It is almost always a must to stop here when I'm at Tempe Marketplace. Their tea is top quality, they have a very knowledgeable staff and an amazing array of tea flavors.  Sometimes if I don't know what I want, I can go in and tell them... I'm tired or I feel under the weather or I feel overly hyper... and the staff can suggest teas to me that will help however I feel.

In my opinion, this is one of the better attractions in the Phoenix metro area. When people visit, this is definitely one of the places I take them to. There is a really large variety of activities to do here.   The main attraction is shopping. There are lots of great shopping places to go here. Then when you've expended all your energy having fun doing that, you can grab something to eat to replenish yourself at one of the surrounding restaurants. They have everything from good ol' cheap, good food to more expensive, higher-end dining.   BUT here is the things that Tempe Marketplace offers that other "malls" usually do not. There is a main stage where a band is playing almost every night (every weekend night at least). Plus, there are fire pits, a kid's water fountain/area and seating for people to just hang out.  The winter season is one of the best times to come here. There are usually lots of fun events. The past couple of years it will "snow" at 7pm. The fire pits are also a great place to socialize when it's chilly out. I usually like to grab a tea (from Tea Fusion) or a coffee (from Starbucks or Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf), sit next to a fire pit and listen to the live music.  Overall great place to go!

This place was only alright. The rolls were a decent size, but the flavor wasn't there for me. Bland is a good word. We went here because of the conveyor belt sushi, but there was almost no selection on the belt and no signs to let you know what was what.  Atmosphere wasn't bad and the service was good.

I love this place! The food here is not only amazing, but also very affordable. I was impressed by the quality and flavor of the food here the first time I went. Plus, every time I come back to order something new, I am impressed again!   I love their panini and regular sandwiches; both are equally delicious. And to go with your tasty meal, you also get, don't act too surprised, a pickle! Now, this isn't just any sandwich pickle, it is their very own pickle and it is quite good. One of my favorites! To top it off, they often have $5 meals after 5pm - a good deal!  I used to go here all the time when I lived in Chandler and now sadly go less frequently because I live downtown. I hope they open a location in downtown soon!!

Yum! The food here is always good and it's a decent price. The owner is really nice and always makes sure that your experience is wonderful. I always get something with Gyro meat and it's usually great. During lunch rush, sometimes the Gryo meat is not cooked at long. It's still good, just hasn't had the chance to capture as much flavor because they go through so much meat. Yea, the decor inside isn't my style, but I've certainly seen way worse in other Greek restaurants. Overall, one of my favorite places to go for Greek food.

In me and my friend's minds, this is the best pizza place in Phoenix metro. I'm surprised to hear that people feel that the food is not good and overpriced and that they have gotten horrible service.   The Food: The pizza here is amazing. Top quality fresh ingredients. Anybody who says otherwise probably doesn't have a mature palette. Yes, if you are looking for a standard, greasy NYC pizza, go to slices around the corner. (Which is also good, just different.) However, if you are looking for a fresh meal that you can leave feeling good, go here.  The Price: I think this place is well priced for what you get - Fresh Ingredients that complement each other. If you aren't full after eating here and think it is too pricey because of your unfulfilled appetite, I have two things to say.  1. You need to reduce your portions- My husband and I can share a pizza here and be full.  2. You need to understand that price isn't always based on quantity, but quality.  The Service: Every time I go to this place, the servers (not just the one waiting my table) are always amazing. In fact, they are so good you would think they were the owner. On top of being prompt, they always are very descriptive and helpful.

Some like it hot. If you're one of those people, you'll like this place. The food is tasty and some of this dishes have a nice kick to it.   I probably come here about 5 times a year when I'm going out to eat with my family. Good place to feed and seat 6-8 people groups. The service is usually descent and the prices aren't too bad.

I love fresh and easy! They always have great prices and deals on good food. I know some people don't like the discounted items that are about to expire, but I love them. They make a great, cheap meal for that day.  I love that I can always walk into a F&E and come out with something I'm excited to make. One of my favorites is their pizza dough w/ whatever ingredients I'm craving at the time (which are usually avl at F&E).   Not all of their products are amazing and some of the prepared meals don't suit my palate, but overall this place it great. I can honestly say my life got a little better when Fresh and Easy came around.

I love the smell of garbage in the morning! .. ok no, I really don't. And this place has got some rank smell, but seriously this is where everybody takes there trash. I didn't expect anything less!  Doing some work on our house, we had a load of heavy tile/rubbish to get rid of. The great part is that this place is free on the weekends if you live in the city of Phoenix. All you need to do it make sure your current Phoenix address is on your drivers license.   There was a little bit of a wait..but it was the weekend after the "Haboob of 2011"!! So, there were lots of people trying to get rid of their fallen down tree clippings understandably. Overall, probably on spent 45 minutes there tops - this included unloading time. Not bad and a heck of a lot cheaper than other options to disposing of trash.  I guess I could have given this 5 stars..but I guess I just can't find it in my to rate a dump a 5 stars. Haha, not sure what a 5-star dump looks like, maybe this is it, but I'll stick to the 4-stars since I'm not sure.

I came here again and had a good experience. The staff was really nice and I got my drinks quick. That is my usual experience, so I will bump this up to 4 stars!

SMEEEKS! I do love this place. It's a great place to find fun knick-knack toys and it has lots of fun candy to choose from. It's great because a lot of the candy is more old fashioned - it feels like you're in an old-school candy store.  The staff is nice and they always have lots of sodas to choose from to go along with your candy.  They are a little more expensive than going to walmart to pick up some candy, but they are a local store! I  love to support local and recommend you do too!

Teakwoods is a great place. Decent food, cheap prices, and nice staff. Plus! you have to love the free bucket of peanuts on every table. I often find myself wondering how and why I have eaten so many peanuts, but still continue to crack more and place them into my mouth. Tuesdays are my favorite day because it is wing night. Wings are both cheap and delicious.

"Meh..I've experienced better" pretty much sums this place up for me. It's not that the food is bad, but I don't think it's great either. The quality of the ingredients seems fairly fresh, but my complaint was more in flavor. It just seems bland. And for the price, I honestly feel I can go somewhere else and get more bang for my buck.  I know lots of people who love this place, but it just isn't for me. I've tried this place a few times and never felt impressed, so I give it 2 stars because I don't plan on going back.

This place is rockin! It's really easy to make tiki seem really lame, but Hula's does a great job of creating a cool, modern tiki environment. On top of that, the food is very tasty.   I had the steak sandwich. The ingredients and seasoning mixed very well together. The steak was perfectly cook and was really great quality. Good prices for what you get.

So far, I've had great experiences here at EWC. The staff is always very friendly and usually get me in and out very quickly. Only once did I have to wait past my appointment time more than a couple minutes. I was sad that I didn't get any type of discount, considering if you are late for your appointment that you get docked. However, the fact that every other time I've been has been positive, I will let it slide. The prices are fairly inexpensive and the products they use always seem to work great for me!

Out of all the local coffee shops, this is one of my favorite. First, and most importantly, the coffee is great! It has a nice rich flavor, but isn't bitter. If you are looking for something a little sweeter, I recommend the Matador (along w/ the 50 other people here have).  Secondly, there is some pretty delicious food. I really like the quiche the best.  Third, the staff is always nice.  Lastly, it's a cool environment. If you're looking for a cool place to hang out, this is a good spot.

Found myself here on a Friday night after a few friends suggested it. Lucky for us, our friends gave us a good suggestion.  The atmosphere is cool - a vintage/modern look. The restaurant in located in what looks to be an old brick home. I wanted to see more of the inside, but it was really nice outside, so we decided to sit on their equally nice patio. The staff was nice enough. But the food was the best part. Good quality ingredients paired well together.

Whhat? I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. It is by far, one of my favorite taco shops in all of Phoenix. Authentic. Quality. Delicious.   When you first come in you get chips and can start experiencing the amazing salsa bar. Each flavor isn't just thrown together, but put together with thought and care. I have favorites, but they are all pretty tasty.  Follow that up with some amazing food (I personally love the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco plate with double rice). Then you can wash it down with a, not-so-traditional, but in a good way Horchata.   They will then drop the bill off and you will be pleasantly surprised that you had such an delicious, fresh meal for such a reasonable price.

Yum yum yum! I love this place's breakfast burrito and their carne asada. For some reason, the first time I went to the 7th ST location, i didn't like it. However, I came back after about 6 months and now I am addicted!  I do prefer this location over the 7th street for some reason. This location seems to have a nicer staff. Plus it's close to some really awesome antique shops! Makes for a great pre-antiquing breakfast!

I'm not vegan, so when I was about to put the Mocha Latte cupcake from Treehouse Bakery into my mouth the first time, I didn't know what to expect. To my delight, I loved it! The cake was moist and the frosting was just the right texture. Together they made a great combination of flavors.  I decided to try a few other things and they were all great. Out of the cookies, I think the peanut butter cookies are my favorite.  Treehouse Bakery = Scrumtrulescently delicious cupcakes, cookies, muffins, and cheesecake that will leave your mouth happy!

So excited that Treehouse has now opened a store front! Now I can indulge in my cupcake urges almost instantaneously! I also love the decor in this place and the neon sign kicks up the coolness a notch for me.

This is how I feel about Torched Goodness. http://youtu.be/G3IgFsEEOik  Perfect idea for a food truck. I got the salted caramel which was very good! The flavor was great and it had a good price to go along with it. I can't wait to go back!

Umm...YUM! Short Leash is, so far, my favorite food truck and my favorite hot dog in Phoenix!  My favorite is the lady, but I do often try their weekly specials. The owner is always super nice, the food is great and affordable. I suggest that you follow them on twitter and find them at a location near you!

What I love best about this place, is that when you are hanging out in the VIP room and your gazing out of the huge wall of windows, you feel like you might be in New York for a second.  I wouldn't say this place is really a bowling alley, but more of just a club, but it is still a fun place to go. I didn't have to pay for anything when I was here because I was a company party, so I can't say if I would have paid for this again, but I did have a good time while I was there.  The drinks were pretty weak, but the food was pretty good and the atmosphere is fun. Plus there is a lot of great places in walking distance.

Five guys gives a good burger! I think their meat is of good quality and their toppings are on par as well. The fries are also very good. I like them Cajun style. Plus, they give free peanuts - who doesn't like the free nuts that Five Guys offer?   This particular location was good. The staff was nice and the food was good. The service was quick. The only down sides to this location is that, one, it is at Scottsdale mall (seriously - the clientele at the mall  seem to find it impossible to see past their own selfish aurora.) and two, the soda machine. They have one of the new, supposedly high-technology dispensers. Really, people can't seem to understand it and it takes 3 times as long waiting in line to get a drink as it would normally.  Otherwise, great place!

Before I start, I want to say that I REALLY like Jimmy John's. Their sandwiches are awesome and have great flavor. They are quick and cheap (that's what she said), but this location...I do NOT like.  The food here is on par with the rest of the JJ's, it's the staff at this location that gets me. First of all, if you have a question about something on the menu, they act like your an idiot. Then, when you finish paying, they assume you've never been and rudely tell you to go wait for your sandwich when in reality you're just waiting for them to hand you the drinks you paid for.  I've been in here multiple times when there is music playing, which is fine, except that the music isn't censored. So, if you are planing on bringing your kids here, you should probably be prepared to have them hear some cuss words.  After you get your food, you will probably be able to see the staff all gathered in a circle laughing and conversing as if they were at a bar, instead of actually working like they should be. Honestly, I'm not sure how this location makes money. They would probably do better to hire a couple of efficient people instead of having 5 or 6 inefficient people on staff who do a horrible job.  If you can - go to another JJ's.

Had an AMAZING time here! I, of course, forgot our server's name.. I believe it was Matt thought, he was awesome! Really talkative and friendly, but not in your face. He suggested we get this side of corn which was fantastic! Both my husband and I loved the tacos and the chips. We also ordered a white sangria, which our server kindly gave us a tiny sample of the red sangria, which I will be getting next time.   Overall great experience. Food was great. Service was great. Atmosphere was great. Price was great.  Loved it and will be back soon!

A couple of things stuck out to me for this place. One was the really clean and refreshing ambience they've got going on. The other thing that stuck out was the lightness, yet tastyness of the food. I had a turkey and egg sandwich, which was pretty darn good.  The staff seemed nice, too and the prices really weren't bad. I met somebody here on my lunch break and surprisingly made it back to the office in time. Sometimes it's hard to get in and out at a sit down place in an hour, but they pulled it off. However, I feel like there would be no pressure if you wanted to stay and chat for a bit.

I LOVE Belinda's pickles. I personally enjoy the pickles with the peppers. The pickles are always crisp and filled with flavor. They always set up shop at the Phoenix Public Market. Whenever we see them there, we must buy. They are usually giving away free samples, so you can try before you buy!

I'm so happy that this Five Guys opened here!  Five Guys is a great place to get a burger. The base is a delicious patty, spiced and cooked with good flavor, inside of a hamburger bun. From there, you can choose an array or toppings or none at all. Once you order, you wait until your number is called and you go get your food.  It can be pretty heavy, so it's not a frequent meal I partake it, but when I do I enjoy it very much so. The Cajun fry's are delicious. There is no reason to order anything other than a small. They give you a cup-full inside of the bag on top of your regular order.

Yum....  Chipotle is delicious! One of my favorite places to go. The quality is almost always consistent and delicious. Decent price for the food, clean environment and the staff is always pretty friendly.  My favorite is barbacoa bowl or salad. Always has great flavor. The chips are also quite delicious. Can get a little busy at lunch (although I think that is common knowledge - thought I'd mention it) - BUT that is because it is so delicious.   This particular location has always done well, but so has most.

I never wanted to find myself on Thomas Rd. saying "I'd like 3 fingers", but that's how my night at Cane's began.... Over all, I can say my 3 finger experience wasn't as fulfilling as I'd hoped.  For being a place that "specializes" in chicken, I wasn't impressed. The special sauce was alright. They give you a piece of toast with your meal. Overall it just seemed greasy - not my style. I'd rather go get some chicken from Safeway.

A great little shop to stop by if you are antiquing in Phoenix. Lots of interesting pieces for a reasonable price. They even offer delivery if you aren't able to transport your newly bought treasures.   The owner was very nice and helpful. You can tell she loves what she does and wants to share the joy of the objects in her store.

Orange Theory is a place that kicks your ass and you like it!  The trainers here are knowledgeable and help you push yourself. The facility is clean and there is usually plenty of parking. It is a little pricier than your normal gym, but I guarantee you will push yourself harder and see results faster at this place.

Mind blown. The burger was amazing. The taco was amazing. The shake was amazing.   Clean interior, friendly staff, good prices and, yes, good food. A+ in my book.

I really loved the atmosphere here. I'm glad that there are people out there using the historic building around DTPHX. The staff was really nice and I enjoyed the coffee. I got an iced Americano, which is easy to make bitter, but it didn't have any bitter to it at all. Overall great experience!

This is, in my opinion, some of the best ramen we've got around! Lots of people are saying it's not authentic, which might be the case, but as far as Phoenix goes, I'm so happy this place exists. I got the spicy miso and was pleasantly surprised. The pork belly appetizer is also fantastic.

I really wanted to like this place.  I ordered the pork broth ramen. The broth and noodles were pretty flavorless. The vegetables were ok, but didn't feel right. The meat inside the broth was actually pretty good, but that's the only thing that stood out. I had to add hot sauce and soy sauce to everything in order to get any type of flavor.   The service and location are fine, but nothing special there either. The price is not bad-$7.50 for the bowl. I was going to get a can of UCC green tea to go with my meal but it was $3.50... $3.50! Ridiculous. Pretty sure I've seen those for $1 elsewhere.   I'm not certain this place is even worth another try. Everything was just meh and they would have to improve greatly for me to want to go back.
