Although the store is a little cluttered always when you walk in, the last time I went I bought a snowboard for my boyfriend and the service was awesome! The guys were so nice and even with it being so busy during Christmas season, they ordered my board and it was the easiest process ever. I highly recommend this store for snowboarding gear!

The food is always good and they are super fast in processing time. We go here about once every two weeks for breakfast on the weekends. We only get carry out because it's always packed and there is no where to stand or sit most of the time and that would be my only complaint.

The food is always good but the service has been very poor every time I go. We started getting carry out over dining it because of how poor the service is.
