Stopped by here for lunch for the first time on Friday.  Great lunch special - 1/2 Tuna Melt and a big bowl of New England Clam Chowda'.  Very tasty, plenty of food and I was told this is a standing Friday special.   Plenty of interesting beers on tap with two nice big tv's showing sports.  Staff was very friendly and I will definitely be going back.    Lunch Special, Iced Tea and a generous tip: $15

One of the best restaurant experiences in Arizona!  We have now been there three times in the last three weeks since being introduced to this culinary gem.  The food is authentic and fresh with specials that are creative and interesting.  The drinks are served with gusto and the customer service and friendly faces are second to none.  This is officially our go-to spot!

The worst customer experience I could ever imagine.  I wish I could give negative stars.  I have to imagine that Plumbing Supply companies in ISIS controlled Mosul Iraq have a better customer experience than Standard Plumbing Supply.    My general contractor sent me to their pick out 2 valves, 1 diverter and 3 shower heads.  I get treated like a big jerk from the minute I walk in the door - the lady is way too busy to help me pick out what becomes an almost $2,000 order.  Seriously, she gave me and my wife maybe 6 minutes of her busy day.  This was 2 weeks ago.  Our new shower has been great to look at and hangout, problem is the standard Moen equipment we ordered is still not there - so it is more of closet or sitting room than a shower at this point.  I have called 4 or 5 times - every time my sales associate is too busy to talk.  My GC says he has called countless times as well - fruitlessly.    The last I heard from them is how sorry they were last Thursday and they were going to have the parts sent overnight via FedEx.  Well today is Tuesday @ 5:35PM.  So either they are complete liars or have no idea what the common term "overnight" means with regard to shipping and freight.    Bottom line:  I would rather chew glass then give them another dollar.

The process started out pretty well with an online assistant named "Sally" pointing me in the supposed right direct with the Internet Sales Manager "mike". From there the situation deteriorated into the typical laborious car salesman charade.  Needless to say, I am not driving a Hyundai from San Tan - it's a shame because the product is solid and I was ready to pull this trigger.  I learned a lesson here.  Go with your gut.  The guys at AutoNation Honda were my first contact in this process and turns out the most honest and straight forward.  A fair balance of a reasonable deal and EXCELLENT customer service.

Great lunch spot.  Quick service with lots of options for a reasonably priced meal.  They also offer fresh wasabi which had me crying!   Miso soup and a salad with all the lunch specials.

Enjoyed a great burger experience this past Sunday.  Toasted bun, just enough BBQ sauce to make it interesting and the burger was cooked perfectly.  Fries are more like chips, but are awesome.  The finishing touch was the homemade next-level jalape√±o sauce.

Gary and his team did a great job fabricating a custom balcony railing to match our existing pergola.  Their attention to detail and Artistic vision made this process and absolute pleasure.  We will bring him back to to a security door and RV gate soon.

Great local spot.  Awesome coffee prepared anyway you can imagine it.  Free WiFi to get some work done while enjoying your coffee or breakfast.  I have had breakfast here twice and I can't get away from the delicious French Toast - real maple syrup and sweet cream. Staff is very friendly and the music playing is always on point.  A real treat in Maricopa.
