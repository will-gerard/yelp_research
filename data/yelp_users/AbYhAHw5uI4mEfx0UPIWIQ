The food is good. It's not great. It may be slightly overpriced for some... BUT  they don't get discounts for buying in bulk like the chains and the owners are good people trying to make an honest living.   It's local, family run business and the service is awesome. The owner greets you with a huge contagious smile when you walk in & she is always super friendly.  AND YES -- DON'T FORGET: it's CASH ONLY!  I wish the Valley had more places like this.

A co-worker introduced me to this place and I love it.   The bread is awesome. I always get the chicken sandwich with roasted red pepper. The pesto dressing is fantastic.  All the food looks great. I haven't heard a complaint from anyone I know. And don't forget to stop by the bakery on your way out.

Wanting something other than a sandwich I stopped in. I got a chicken teriyaki bowl with white chicken. The chicken tasted bland and manufactured. A few pieces were also a bit fatty. The sauce was good but not good enough to save the meal. Thumbs down.

I checked out Cibo after reading the reviews on Yelp.  The wait wasn't too bad for a Saturday night. To kill the time, we went next door to Local Breeze and had a few drinks (I want to check that place out next).  After about a 30 minute wait, we got seated at Cibo. The place feels "cozy." As previous posts have pointed out, the restaurant is built into an old house. It's got a nice atmosphere. You can go with friend or take a date.  My group all ordered a pizza (Margherita, Prosciutto Crudo, and Salmone). No one had any complaints. Everyone liked the crust and the fresh ingredients. I'm not a big fan of ham, but the prosciutto was fantastic!  For dessert, we ordered the Nutella and Mascarpone. It was refreshing (on the day we went, it happened to be 115 degrees -- gotta love summer in Phoenix).  I'm glad I went, I'd go again, and I'd recommend the place to a friend.

The customer service gets 5 stars. The staff there is great & provide one-on-one attention.  I went in for new shoes. Using a treadmill, the employee did a video analysis to figure out which shoes would be the best for me.  The employee then took the time to bring out FIVE pairs of shoes & let me run around outside to try out each one.  The staff was knowledgeable about what they were doing.  Great place.  While they have a great selection of running shoes, I wish they had other shoes as well.... but not a huge deal.

It took me a couple of tries to get used to it but now I am hooked! JJ's is a fantastic alternative to Subway. I give it 4 stars --with the realization it is fast food. Great, tasty, quick sandwich!

For the price - the car wash was mediocre. When I left, there were water marks on the car.  I paid $30 for "VIP wash." Despite the list of services included - the car did not have the 'wow' look when I left (and it's a new car so it's not like they would have had to put a lot of elbow grease into cleaning it).  This was my first trip. While it could have been worse - I won't be making a second trip.
