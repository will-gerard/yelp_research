Let me just preface by saying I absolutely love the food at Grazie! The Emiliana salad is fantastic and the Vegiearina Pizza is to die for (the onions are so sweet and the perfect mix with the salty cheese).   BUT... after my experience there a few weeks ago with a large party, I seriously might never go back! The place has a reputation for terrible service, and I guess it fulfilled those expectations. Our party of 13 for a surprise birthday dinner was seated for 15 minutes before the absentminded server came to let us know he'll be with us shortly for drinks. Finally, he came over, took our drink order and I let him know up front that we would need to do separate checks.... his response: "ummm that takes a long time, can you do at least 4 people per check?"  What?!?   After pre-ordering the desert calzone, he decided to place the order for a regular calzone and not let the guest of honor order an entree because "someone else already ordered for him."   Half way through the meal, a surprise guest arrive- a Cockroach scurrying across our table! The owner simply said "oh it's because we leave the patio doors open" and took the crushed roach in my napkin to the trash.   After 2 1/2 hours it's desert time, we get the Calzone situation straightened out, and before even asking anyone if they would like to order desert, plates and silverware are placed on the table (hello... this is a surprise dinner, the Birthday boy doesn't know they are bringing him desert!!!).   Finally, we get the check, which of course, the server decided to just put us all on one bill (with an automatic 20% gratuity... no wonder why he didn't care about actually serving us) and then proceeded to complain about the number of credit cards being charged.   To all of you Grazie lovers: I have love for the place too, well, the food, but the above is just so unacceptable and disappointing... wouldn't you agree?   Total Time Frame: 7pm-11pm.... for Pizza.

I've been coming to El Encanto for just about 15 years now and every time I get the same thing!! Two words: Pollo Fundido. Do you love cheese?!? Do you want creamy cheesiness in every delicious bite of your Mexican Euphoria? Don't even look at the menu. The other things worth talking about are the Queso Guillermo appetizer. Of course, more cheesy deliciousness accompanied by dried shredded beef,  pico de gallo, and a few sliced limes.   The salsa is amazing- try not to fill up!! You must save room for a Chocolate chimichanga with Mint Chocolate Chip Ice cream for desert.   Warning: you will go home with an stomach explosion- but consider yourself warned, and it's 100% worth every bite!

SPICE HEAVEN!!!  If you love to cook, bake, grill- whatever, you will absolutely die when you walk in this place! They have every single spice you can imagine (over 40 types of Cinnamon for example... who knew that was possible?!?). They have a variety of specialty spices in rare raw and pure form, as well as blended spices and seasonings for different forms of cooking.   One of my favorite purchases is the Vanilla Bean Sugar. It's just pure white sugar with fresh vanilla bean mixed it- I love to sprinkle a little in my morning Oatmeal! Delish!   If you're stuck on what to buy Mom for Mother's Day, or maybe a bridal shower gift- pick up one of their pre-made gift baskets or customize one to suite that person's kitchen hot buttons!   This place is a must visit- you will definitely not walk out empty handed!

I just realized that I have never wrote an actual review on Nick's, my favorite Phoenix spot. Maybe it's the nostalgia? I've been coming here since High School. Maybe it's the casual, family owned atmosphere? No matter which location you visit, you'll most likely see Nick checking up on things. Most importantly, it's the consistency. No matter which location you choose, it all tastes great, every time.   For me, this is good Italian food, but in the American way. If you're looking for real Italy italian, you may choose another spot, but I find the typical Lasagna, Ravioli, Baked Zitti to be fantastic! I love their Bolognese, and if you notice on my profile, my last meal on earth would be their chicken parmesan with a side of spaghetti bolognese- each entree comes with a huge side of either fresh veggies or pasta. The portions are huge, so I love to eat some, and it's always even better the next day! Here are a few of my favorite dishes:    -Di Mare Salad (with grilled calamari like Gabi M says) - Tilapia Picatta - Chicken Ravioli (my best friend Natalie always tells me that if you get     the Chicken tortellini, you actually get more!) -Chicken Parm (note the above) -Baked Ziti (have them add meatballs) -Cannoli (I'm pretty sure I could spoon feed the filling like ice cream! Was that too much?)   Go to any one of their locations for a casual, quick Italian meal- I'm never disappointed!

Clean. Quick. Good Price. Options. Friendly Staff- what more could you want for your Sunday Mani Pedi?   Well, after trying to go to my normal spot Allure Nails on a Sunday at 10 (they don't open until 11), I checked out near by Nail salons on my Yelp Blackberry application and found this gem!   Like Gabi M. said it's super clean, with granite countertops and top of the line nail salon chairs. Shawn also offered me a bottle of water multiple times throughout my pedicure. They have an awesome selection of colors, and actually have the racks organized! Plus, all pedicures automatically come with hot stone message after the normal foot scrub and heal treatment. Even their basic pedicure for $25 gives you a little more, but they have tons of upgraded options if you want to spoil yourself!  Note: they did not have a tip line on my credit card charge slip- good thing I had cash or I wouldn't have been able to tip!

This is my first review!!  Anyway... Humble Pie. My co-worker and I went for lunch today after reading the mixed reviews on here, and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. I love Pizza, and if it was socially acceptable for me to eat it for every meal, I really would; I think that Humble Pie definitely meets my standards.   We sat outside on the patio, which normally I would love, accept for the mister/fan system combo, which made my straight- but naturally curly hair- frizz up in seconds. I was surprised to see the place relatively empty for 12:15 during the week, but I guess it's still "new." Our server, a young guy, greeted us right away with glasses of water, and had our other drinks to the table in seconds. Note to Humble Pie: if you leave the sweetener packets on the mystified tables- the sugar clumps together and doesn't come out of the packets!   We ordered the Chopped Vegetable Salad to start and it was amazing! Not heavy, a little tangy, a great mixture of veggies (Asparagus, white beans, cherry tomatoes'), and the cheese was amazing! I'm a big fan of the chopped lettuce!   Next, we shared two Pizza's: Chicken Pesto with Leaks and the other was a simple Margahrita. Both, were very good! The mozzarella was fresh, the tomato sauce on the Margarita was tangy and smooth, and the Chicken on the Pesto Pizza was moist and delicious! Everything was seasoned perfectly and the crust had the perfect amount of crunch.   The pizza's are small, so I walked away feeling very satisfied and definitely wanting to go back! I bet at night this place is going to be packed!   Hurray for Humble Pie!!

It's Saturday, it's rainy day... and all I want to to do... is eat. My Dad, boyfriend and I decide to try the new Herb Box location in DC Ranch, even though we've been to the original locations hundreds of times.   Upon first walking in, I loved the intimate setting and decor. I will affectionately call this the "Arcadia Farms of North Scottsdale" because of the ladies-lunch like atmosphere. Lucky for the two men that I'm with, we spotted about 3 other guys over time!   We ordered the Cilantro-Lime Crab Dip with Plantain Chips. At first, I was startled that the dip was cold, but really got into the bold flavors by the second or third chip. I would have eaten more, but my Dad proceeded to dump half the bowl on his plate and hoover it down! It must have been good!   Entrees included the Flatbread with heirloom tomato's, goat cheese and roasted corn, Butternut Squash Enchiladas with a tomatillo salsa, and a boring Tuna Sandwich.   I loved the flat bread! It was crispy, and the corn was perfectly sweet to balance out the goat cheese. The enchilada's were very different, light and fresh tasting.   The tuna sandwich was boring (Go to Taylor's Cafe for the best Tuna!!) but like Gabi said... the sweet potato chips are amazing and I had to beg the server to take them away from me so I would stop eating!   Overall, I really liked this place for a weekend lunch joint! The way I see it, go big or go home.. stuff your face at a place like this maybe once a month, because the price is not something you want to spend every day. But then again... maybe most people don't order like we do :)

YOU ARE GOING TO DIE!!!   For awhile now I have been saying that the Kierland/Promenade area needs to have a frozen yogurt shop. Well Miami Rice is sooo much better than that!   Miami Rice is a store completely centered around 20+ flavors of Rice Pudding! Along with the typically ice cream toppings, they also have Active Culture Frozen Yogurt. They have everything from your typical Chocolate and Vanilla flavors, to Peanut Butter (my favorite), Canoli (amazing) and Coconut Creme.   Mix a little bit of Rice Pudding with the French Vanilla Frozen Yogurt... I'm telling you, it is amazing!!   All of their products are gluten free and no trans fat. The yogurt's are non fat as well, and I believe the puddings are too, but don't quote me on that.   They owners of this franchise are so warm and welcoming and let me have as many samples as I wanted! Through conversation they even offered to give me free Rice Pudding refills... seriously who does that?!?   If you're looking for an not-so-fatty alternative to Fro-yo or Gelato, try Miami Rice!   (They will even tell you to "Have A Rice Day!")

I just love Sam Fox and all of his foodie goodness! True Food Kitchen, the latest to come from Fox Restaurant Concepts and Dr. Andrew Well of the Oprah fame, certainly lives up (and possibly surpasses) the fame of it's sister restaurants.   The menu consists of all Natural/ organic foods with a healthy twist. The servers are even wearing "natural clothes" that actually look like pajamas!   I ate quick and wish I had time to really dive into the menu, but what I had... I loved! My boyfriend had the Ahi Tuna burger and said "it was the best ahi burger he has ever had" (BOLD STATEMENT). I had the Turkey Spaghetti Bolognese, which was amazing! The bolognese had chucks of carrots and other vegetables, and the portion size was perfect. We definitely wanted to try the Sashimi appetizer, that the table next to us said was delicious and fresh.   Overall, the service was excellent- they really were interested in if we enjoyed our experience and had any comments for the new serving team. I loved the menu, it was so different and not outrageously priced. It's clear that a lot of research went in to everything from the decor to the wine selection.   I'm looking forward to getting into the menu a bit more next time!!

Can we all agree that the absolute most annoying thing is bad service?!? I had the strangest experience at Daily Dose. I read the review in the Arizona Republic about the amazing omelette's, pancakes, and overall atmosphere so I was dieing to try it!   The atmosphere is very lounge-like and completely different than most Breakfast hot spots. The owner was very friendly and sat us right away- the table happen to be next to her baby asleep on the booth bench next to me. You know when you are sitting so close to two other tables that it's hard to even hold conversation??   We ordered- I asked for the Prime Rib Omelet and my boyfriend got the Caprese Omelet. Our server (there were only two for the entire restaurant) messed up the order but nonetheless, I felt the food was lacking overall flavor- basic things like Salt and Pepper! Don't be fooled- the food looks amazing! But back to the "experience...."   As the owner brings us our food, she was sure to point out "tell all of your friends that this is a great place to drink!" And brought us a drink menu filled with Happy Hour specials and things like "Join us for NFL Sundays." So the loungy  atmosphere, with NFL Sundays and Drink Specials, leads me to ask... what exactly is this place?!? In Old Town Scottsdale, with so many Breakfast restaurants, or bars, or sports bars, you need to stand out- pick what type of place you're going to be, and go with it!   They most annoying part of our Breakfast was that good friends of the owner and server were seated at the table next to us- while the two payed more than enough attention to that tables needs for drinks/paying the check, I sat there for a good 15 minutes with out Coffee or Water and a messed up order! It doesn't end there, another couple walks in the front door, and the owner is in the middle of bottle feeding her baby, so baby in tow, she seats the couple.... does anyone else think that's weird?!?   Ironically enough, as we're sitting there, empty cups, check ready to be paid, Channel 3 TV comes in to film the great place- I couldn't help but tell my boyfriend how unsatisfying the experience was as the camera man panned across our table.

I would love to keep this short and to the point. Press is amazing! Such a unique concept of Coffee meets Wine with a friendly, relaxed atmosphere! I tend to go every Sunday morning to read the paper, a drink and some good. Try the  Iced Toddy, which is their version of Iced Coffee and is specially brewed to not be watered down. This drink makes Starbucks taste like water, and ever since, I can not bring myself to go back to Starbucks (not that their coffee was good anyway).   The staff is so friendly- after going just a few short times, they know your name and what you like to eat and drink.   Try the Steal-cut Oatmeal or Breakfast Burritos!   You will absolutely fall in love with Press... and it's dog friendly too! Woof!

One of my most favorite pleasures in my food life is Sunday Brunch. If you're looking for that amazing Hotel brunch buffet, this is the spot! I've been to a good amount of the fancy resort brunch buffets, but this one has the best spread, and for the best price.   $60 per person (don't chock) get's you unlimited amount of fresh shell fish, Belgian Waffles, Pancakes and typical breakfast items, the most amazing Filet Mignon taco's, petite filets, shrimp scampi, unbelievable crab cakes, lamb chops, a huge spread of cheeses and dried fruits, and finally, an entire room dedicated to your sweet tooth! Honestly, I could keep going on, that is just a few of my favorite items! Each dish is constantly replaced- don't you hate it at the buffet when there is one scoop of hash browns left stuck to the side of the pan? Services is Marriott amazing, and I promise, if you are looking to gorge yourself and your family on a special occasion, do not overlook Camelback Inn!   PS- the patio is gorgeous and they have nice live music throughout brunch!

This place is like a well oiled machine! From the second you call to schedule your initial (and free) consultation, to all of your post-opp follow up appointments, you will be blown away by the professionalism and prompt service.   I chose to use Dr. McCullough because he came recommended by my normal eye Dr. and many family friends. The new location off of Allied Way (behind Whole Foods off of Scottsdale Rd. and Mayo Blvd) is absolutely gorgeous. I have never waited more than 5 minutes for my schedule appointment, and never more than that for Dr. McCullough to come to the exam room.   I had one pre-opp consultation- we agreed that PRK surgery would be best for my thin corneas. I scheduled the surgery for the following Friday.. check out the schedule: 2pm- Take Valium for relaxation 3pm- Arrive at office (feeling good!)  3:10pm- Pre-opp measurements 3:15-3:30- Post Opp instructions 3:30pm- Surgery 3:35pm- Walk out of Surgery 3:40pm- Get in Car and drive home  I wish I was joking, but I'm not! Bing, Bang, Boom- I was outta there!   Now, 3 months later, I see a perfect 20/20 (PRK has a  bit of a longer recovery time, which is why it is the less desired choice, but still totally worth it!).   The Consultants were more than flexible with financing terms and offer incredible discounts depending on what you Vision Insurance allows (I have Aetna and they gave 15% off just as a courtesy for having insurance!!!).   I loved Horizon Eye- I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who is even slightly considering correcting eye surgery!

If there was such a thing as zero stars- this place would be it!   A friend a I went for Restaurant week and the food was nothing to ever go back to. We had the crab "cakes" which I am surprised they can even get away with calling it that- more like fried crab and mayonnaise balls.   Then, we had both had a Chili and Coffee rubbed Scallops. They cut the scallops in half to make it look like more, dunked them in a oil bath and then poured coffee grinds and chili paste all over... mmm yummy!!!   The best part of the meal comes with the check: they neglected to tell us that after a month of being in business, they still have not connect their American Express machine. When we went to pay, the server said "ohh we can't take that yet." To which my friend and I argued that we should have been notified ahead of time, what if we have nothing else to pay with?? The conversation gets so ridiculous that the manager comes over and tells us it's not his fault and there is nothing he can do so I will have to pay for the entire meal with cash or another credit card. "I told my servers to tell each table" he said. I'm pretty sure that's not a good enough explanation.   I am sparing you tons of heated details... the bottom line is I give this place 5 months tops and it will be donzo!

Mmm I'm a fan for sure! This is one of those  places for breakfast that could easily be overlooked- but don't!   They have a really cute patio that is the perfect outdoor Saturday morning breakfast spot. I love the Roasted Corn Omelet. It comes with these amazing potatoes (a mix of sweet potato's, purple and white potatoes- delish)! If you're not too hungry, try getting the Cucumber and Avocado smoothie, or the granola with fresh berries and yogurt!   It's so surprising to have a live music bar have such great organic and healthy food! I will say the one down side is that the service is slow, which of course, if my big no-no.  But overall,  if you're in the north phoenix/scottsdale area, check it out!

I'm definitely a fan! Here is what I like: -A trough of cheese for me to drool over and spread on a variety of toast-point options - Creative hot and cold sandwich's, including the Chicken Gruyere with Pancetta and Balsamic Onions- try this on Sourdough rather than the Baguette and you won't be sorry!  - Coffee. Good, strong Coffee. - Friendly Staff - Homemade Salsa to pick up on the cooler  Here is what needs some work:  -It's pricey. I wish I could play here more, but I feel I would be broke relatively fast.   Oakville Grocer, I hope you withstand the pressures of the economy that has cursed other Markets/Restaurant concepts such as yourself (eh hem.... The Kitchen? Dish?) and last a long time!

I really love this place! A casual and comfortable atmosphere with awesome food and good priced wines! I love 5th and Wine for Happy Hour during the week with girlfriends-try and sit in their "living room" setting and grab a few appetizers and a $5 glass of wine- I really love their Riesling.  The French Fries and Bruschette's are a great way to mix sweet (Brie and Apple Bruschetta) and salty (garlic and parmesan fries).   Want to get crazy? Try the Julia Child's  Beef Bourguignon, a Saturday night Specialty that is Hearty and absolutely delicious!

This place is huge! I love the decor, atmosphere, and of course, the food! I went for happy hour during the week (pretty good happy hour menu) and shared a few things:   -Beet Lollipops- I think they need to be revamped- instead of roasted beats on a stick, rolling in crushed pistachios and served with a goat cheese dipping sauce, it should be the beat, stuffed into a goat cheese ball, and then rolled into pistachios -Red Pepper Hummus: it doesn't top Pita Jungle's, but good in its own right. I love the crunchy lavosh and thing sliced cucumber  it's served with - Deviled Eggs!! Yowzers!! You must try these!  -Mac and Cheese with Chicken: so delish, really creamy and huge chunks of grilled chicken!  -Cucumber Martini: not too sweet and very refreshing  Our server was so friendly and attentive, and told us that recently, Saturday nights have been packed. I've heard they have great bands (but he specifically told is they are shying away from the "blue martini" type bands).   They're main menu looked amazing! I can't wait to go back and try more!

It makes me so happy when I find a great new lunch spot! Vatra has a fabulous menu of ....carbs! If your dieting, i recommend you save this for later! They bring two kinds of bread to start with a tomato butter- pace yourself, there is more! My friend and I shared the Smoked Brea appetizer, which is smoked on a cedar plank- when it arrived at our table, the cedar smell filled out table and the flavor eased into the cheese- so good! The apple chutney on top was so delicious with the cedar flavor! We also shared the Aria pizza and asked to add caramelized onions, a great touch! The crust had a good flavor and the ricotta and prosciutto on top were very fresh, however this is not bursting with flavor. I found myself taking some of the tomato butter and putting it on the pizza.. oops!  I love the contemporary, zen atmosphere and really can't wait to go back for dinner- I have heard that in such a short time, the place packs people in!
