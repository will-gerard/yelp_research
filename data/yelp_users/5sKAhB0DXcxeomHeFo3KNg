Very impressed with the service. Most RA locations I've been to have snotty service but here they really are friendly. Sushi was delicious a lot better than my last RA experience at another location. Came in during Sunday happy which I would recommend.

I'm a fan of RA and this was my first visit to this location. I went with a friend and my daughter during happy hour so I expected it to be busy. When we arrived we gave our name to one hostess and she said they were cleaning a table so we should be seated shortly. About 5 mins later another party of 2 arrived and they gave our table to them so we ended up waiting another 10 mins for a table. We ordered and wanted our appetizer first but they ended up bringing our sushi first and our appetizer last!?? Our waiter was horrible obviously he wasn't hired for being a good waiter. He cared more about flirting with us and other guest. When it was time to pay we split the bill and he never brought back change. I tried getting his attention but he didn't care. I was to fed up to wait for my change. He definitely didn't deserve that $10 tip on a $35 bill. Beside the bad service the sushi was great which is why I give them 2 stars. They need to train the staff with better customer service.

Ehhh not the best. Came here around lunch time in a Friday and the place was not busy. The moment we walked in the employees were standing around talking to each other we were completely ignored. One employee who seemed rather busy cleaning a table came to seat us, because the other employees didn't. The menu offered many options but everything seemed the same. I finally settled for a basic burger. After receiving our food our waiter was no where to be seen. It took awhile to finally get the attention of another employee to switch out the high chair because the one I had for my daughter had a broken buckle. For a place that did not have many customers the noise level was loud not because if people talking but the annoying background music I couldn't even have a conversation with my friend. After finishing our meals an employee came up immediately to clean the table but we were still waiting on a check. Not sure I will be coming back.

Not impressed. The offer lunch specials at a great cost. I ordered a slice of pizza and 6 medium wings. Was disappointed with the pizza being super thin and hardly had any taste, the wings weren't any better they had no taste and they were super dry. I don't plan on coming back.

Amazing food and service. Came in during happy hour and was surprised at how little I spent. I ordered chicken nachos which was delicious and only cost $5. The passion fruit sangria was just what I needed and only $4. In the end I spent under $10. This is my new happy hour spot!

One word to describe this place DIRTY! With all the bodies that they pack in here you think they would provide good a/c. It's so sticky and gross the moment you walk in. Nothing is clean and the playground is not maintained. The tables to eat on are neglected and I didn't see a worker wipe them once. Even the workers look dirty as if they ran a marathon I guess due to the lack of ventilation. Expect to smell body odor the entire time you are here. After leaving I needed a shower. For the price they charge I expected a more clean environment I was lucky enough to have a groupon so I paid half the regular cost. The kids enjoyed the place but complained about the smell.

Built my own bison burger which was delicious you can't really go wrong with a burger. Meat was cooked just as I wanted. Ordered a side of sweet potato fries and was disappointed. They were dry and over cooked. They were more like sweet potato chips because they were hard and crunchy. Service was alright not the best I've had. The decor is hideous the blue windows can really hurt the eyes. I would recommend eating outside, inside smells terrible like they have a bad sewer line. You think they would fix the problem.

No longer my favorite Starbucks. Horrible customer service. Received bad service twice in 4 days. Apparently it is so hard to smile. Girl at the drive through really did not seem to care. Decided to go inside for once and they forgot my drink. The girl did not write it down, and seemed more interested in talking with her friend then helping me. Don't see myself coming back.

Came here as a walk-In with a friend and we were given an appointment right away. My friend got a manicure and I got a pedicure. They lady did an awesome job my toes turned out great it definitely was a great experience.  I brought my baby with me and the everyone was so kind and patient when she became fussy. Their seemed to be a ton of regulars which says a good thing. The prices for my pedicure with a design was $24 so the prices are wonderful. I will definitely be coming back. For anyone coming for the first time be sure to have cash for a tip.

Went to Filiberto's because I wanted fish tacos. Was very disappointed because the fish tasted as if it was sitting out for hours maybe even days, and recooked. I took one bite and that was it. When I approached the workers not only did they deny that the fish was bad, but they refused to give me an order of something else at no cost. Very disappointed and never going back!

Great little bakery hidden in a run down looking strip mall. Don't let the location fool you. This was my first visit, I was looking for some authentic macaroons and I made the right choice coming here. The owner greeted me and pointed to the list of flavors. I ordered blueberry, mango,raspberry and chocolate orange. They tasted fresh, I finished each piece in 2 bites! They were delicious and the price was great $1.50 a piece. I also discussed with the owner the different options of cakes for my daughters upcoming birthday. I will definitely be returning and and will be updating my review when I do!

Not the best frozen yogurt. Limited flavor choices and limited toppings. Frozen yogurt was not cool enough and was very runny. If you are looking to get fruits in your yogurt this is not the place, fruits appeared dry and not fresh. A little to pricey I want to say I paid over 40 cents an ounce.

Absolutely yummy. I recommend the Gelati. It's three layers, custard on the bottom the Italian ice in the middle and custard on top. I'm a fan of orange so I had orange cream custard and orange Italian ice. The staff was wonderful they offered samples which really helped with finding flavors that tasted well together.

Went here for lunch and I absolutely loved it. The moment I walked in was greeted my a very nice waitress. When we were seated and given a menu the prices were low. For lunch you receive a bowl of egg drop or sweet and sour soup along with an egg roll and your choice of rice. I ordered mandarin chow mein with shrimp most restaurants charge extra if its not chicken not this place. You can choose any type of  meat or shrimp at no extra cost. No to mention the food was ready right away.   For two lunch orders and drinks the total was just below $20. I will definitely be returning.

Such a great place to bring the kids. They have an area for the big kids and a toddler area. While here I ordered a turkey sandwich on a croissant and an Italian soda. The sandwich portion was just right.  My only complaint is they need to keep the toddler zone a toddler zone. My 15 month old was playing in the area and some kids way to big for that area kept pushing and kicking her. They really need to make sure the parents are watching their kids. I had to tell these kids to play nicely because the parents wouldn't. Some parents bring their kids here and pay no attention to them so beware. The entire time I was here I heard 5 kids crying because another child had hurt them. Make sure you avoid lunch time it can get super crowded and limited seating. They only have a few couches surrounding the play zone.

First off I purchased a groupon for a 3 hour class. I was hesitant about taking the class (I lack painting skills) but wine and painting seemed like a great pair. The instructors were fabulous and they walk you through every step. They provide all the art supplies and the wine glasses, just bring a bottle (or 3). Makes a great date or girls night, whatever your reason you will not be disappointed.
