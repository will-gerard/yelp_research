Small place - best for take out.  The food is very good, fresh and consistent.  I order from there anytime I want Chinese food.

Love this place!  So Dak owned.  Food is decent.  Love the rib tips.  The live music is fun. Fire pits to roast marshmallows are super fun for kids.  It's a great place to just go and hang out.  If you plan on going out after the only draw back is you leave smelling like a camp fire.  But I fed recommend checking this place out.  Unique  and always fun.

Great calamari-  I'm from NJ so I know Italian food.  Good sauce.  I recommend going for lunch.  Good lunch menu and reasonable.

One of my favorites in the East Valley.  Consistent and absolutely awesome food.  The Thai mussels are wonderful, I have never eaten anything @ Otaku that wasn't awesome!  Talented sushi chefs and great service.

I love Taco Bell for years and is one of the o my fast foods I eat.  This location I was excited about but every order in the last 8 visits they got wrong.  Wrong ingredients, wrong orders, sour cream on everything.  It seems like they don't know the menu and just throw whatever together and it should be good. I will not go to this location again.

Good to see a new thriving restaurant in the area.  I'm from NJ so we always battle Chicago pizza but this place is good.  Friendly atmosphere, good sized portions and it's a place to try in the East Valley- especially if you're from Chicago.

Excellent new place.  The food is fresh and tasty.  Fire wood oven - I had the chicken pesto sandwich.  My mom had the caprese sandwich and my dad has the Italian.  All were fantastic.  The place is clean, decorated nicely and a friendly staff.  I will go back again if not get a pizza from there tonight.
