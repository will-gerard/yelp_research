Times are getting better, much better. But we're still not back to where we were in 05' 06', so when my wife's birthday rolled around we thought it would be a good time to use the Roy's gift card we'd received as a gift from a family member. My wife, daughter (16), son (19) and I slipped into our goin' to town duds and we were off.  Considering the generous amount on the gift card, we thought we were in for treat. We used to be Roy's regulars at the Scottsdale location, but that was quite some time ago, and we were in for some surprises.  My wife had been thinking of sushi all week, but except for one quasi-roll, Roy's no longer serves it, so that's what my wife settled for. My Daughter ordered the short rib, and my son and I splurged, or so we thought, on the surf and turf which was billed as a petit filet and half a poached lobster. I understand petit, and I didn't expect an Aussie tail and an 8 ounce filet but what we got was shocking. If our filet's were 4 oz's I'll eat my hat, (which is about 8 oz). 3 bites and it was gone, the lobster would have been a decent sized prawn, 3 slivers of asparagus, a tablespoon of potatoes. I kept expecting Ashton Kutcher to pop up and tell me we were being punked. Again I didn't expect a Texas steak so big that "If you eat it it's free" but this was beyond the pail. I've eaten all over the world, I'm somewhat experienced.  I moved what little there was around my plate and then pretended that I was full from the calamari appetizer. I gave my son half of my steak, (1.5 bites) and all of my lobster tail. It was just appalling. My daughters meal was wonderful and my wife enjoyed the roll, we both had a glass of wine and we still had to cough up $140. on top of the $100 Gift Card. I left the place feeling like Clark Griswold after those Arizona Mechanics emptied his wallet for those 4 bald tires. Totally screwed. It was my Wife's birthday so I kept a smile on my face as we strolled around the beautiful Marriott grounds after dinner, then drove us home and made myself a sandwich.

It's not enough to be different. To offer Ukrainian Mango Fish with Jupiter Nuts and curried Venezuelan Pangopeas is nothing to crow about if it taste like, well, crow. Restaurants who live by this "different is enough" credo usually burn brightly then disappear quickly. The townspeople eventually let the king know he is wearing no clothes. It takes courage for a restaurant to be different and it takes real talent to do it well. When I take the time to shave my legs, do my hair and put on a new dress, I want an adventure. I'm looking for something new, something different, and nothing buried in cheese.  Last night I hung the whip from my belt, said goodbye to my monkey and left for our 9:15 reservation (yeah, that's right, 9:15) at  Cowboy Ciao.    Cowboy Ciao is nestled among a group of restaurants along Stetson Drive in Old Towne. You really have a lot of options if you're walking that street, but none will give you what you will experience at Cowboy Ciao.   Let's start with the hostess stand. It's the end of the dinner rush, yet when we enter we are greeted with a burst of enthusiastic attention that makes me feel much more important than I deserve. If I'd gotten this kind of treatment on our first date it might not have taken so long for Tammy to...nevermind.  Tammy's entrée was the special, seared Diver's Scallops in a braised beef reduction with mushroom.  The scallops were perfectly cooked, tender and sweet. The beef and seafood flavor pairing was startling for the first second, then together with the mushroom they melded together in such harmony, well if it were 1962 Liverpool, Brian Epstein would have put suits on them and booked them on the Ed Sullivan Show.    I had a braised pork shank over fingerling potatoes and a cranberry walnut chutney. Excuse me a moment while I blot the saliva from my keyboard. Okay. The shank was fork tender, and the chutney, this little knot of heaven perched atop the shank, could make you forget a foreclosure. The richness of the nuts, the sharp bite of the cranberries put me in a trance. As if this weren't enough, this rapturous shank sat on a bed of fingerling potatoes nestled in a rich cheese sauce. This dish is pure, unadulterated comfort. As comforting as watching "It's a Wonderful Life" in a snowy cabin, in front of a roaring fire, on Christmas Eve, with Burl Ives humming carols during the commercials. Are you feelin' me?  If it's possible, the only thing as good as the food is the service.  When the staff at Cowboy Ciao gets through with you, you will gladly, enthusiastically give them the keys to your beach house, you will drive them to the airport, you will help them move. Whatever they need, because they have tried, and I'm pretty sure succeeded, in listening to you and then giving you everything you need. They navigated us through the 3200 different wine labels and the nearly 30,000 bottles, to two glasses that paired perfectly with our divergent entrée's. (Incidentally, the wine they recommended was only $12 a glass, and that for a nice pour. Not bad when they also offer wines at around $30 a glass.)   Now for the R-rated appetizer.  You might want to dim the lights, lock the door and wedge a chair under the knob.  Cowboy Ciao's menu is peppered with guest quotes. The quote that accompanies this dish is, and I quote "That Mushroom dish is so good, I wanted to take my clothes. ." I like to think it was said by an attractive woman. It is called the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry.  Cremini, button, oyster, cepe, lobster, black trumpet, shiitake, morel and yellow foot mushrooms bathed in ancho cream over double-cooked polenta, topped with grilled portabellini, avocado, tomato and cotija cheese. Enough said.  Now unlock the door, smoke a cigarette and go to bed

First of all, there really is a Flo. It's her face on the website, and you will see her at Flo's Chinese Restaurant often, walking the tables, checking on her guests, a strong quiet presence. Here is what I think you need to know: Flo gets it.  She understands what people want, how much, how fast, and she get's that while things are better, they can still be tight.   Iv'e been to dinner at Flo's with a party as big as 17.  Finding a restaurant that will please the 17 distinct and neurotic personalities of food-mates, (Settle down, I keep you anonymous) is no small task.   There are roughly 15 Appetizers to choose from, and Flo's sweet and sour sauce is the mortar we use to hold them all together. It is great on everything, and I've poured it straight from the saucer into my mouth. It's so good I've devoted a whole paragraph to it. Back to the Appetizers. My daughter Olivia will lie right to your face to get an extra Flo's spring roll. She will fake a limp, put her arm in a sling, ask you if you've lost weight. Whatever it takes. Our Wing-nut, we'll call him Cluck Norris, calls Flo's Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings one of his favorites.  I'm happy enough with the little bowl of wontons and sweet and sour sauce, Flo's version of chips and salsa, that come to the table gratis.   Flo's offers a green dinner salad. The lettuce is fresh, topped with some orange slices, pretty standard stuff. It's the dressing, this magnificent, green, sweet, horseradishey (look it up, it's an actual culinary term) nectar that is absolutely fabulous. We've tried to coax a few of the ingredients out of Flo's savvy and tight-lipped crew, telling them we have allergies and that it's a safety concern, but no dice. They smile knowingly and give nothing away.  The main courses are solid, and we can't budge our kids from their favorites. My son, 19 and 6'7" has two favorites, the Cinnamon Shrimp and the Sweet and Sour Chicken. The shrimp are plump and sautéed with peas and carrots in a sweet-spicy sauce with a hint of cinnamon. It is served, as several of Flo's dishes are, over shredded lettuce. Yeah, shredded lettuce. My favorite dish, the Lemon Pepper Shrimp and Chicken, comes over shredded lettuce and it hits all the gustatory pleasure zones. The shrimp pops in your mouth, the chicken is sliced thin and together with the lemon and pepper, the oils and scallions, is savory and spicy, crunchy and rich. I have to tell you, I've tried to speak while eating it and drooled right in front of a loan officer I'd taken to lunch. It's just the price of doing business at Flo's.   A Chinese restaurant is only as good as it's Sweet and Sour Sauce. I know an authentic sweet and sour sauce is supposed to be browner than it is red. The sweet is supposed to come from the sugars in fruit or honey, the sour from vinegar. So, in terms of authenticity, where's all the ubiquitous bright red sauce come from? I don't care. I want my Sweet and Sour sauce really sweet, and slut lipstick red. Flo's delivers.  It is soo good.  I could eat a bowl of white rice, drenched in Flo's Sweet and Sour, every day for the next 9 months and not get bored. When I'm alone, I like to take a big table spoon of it and smash it into my face then pull the spoon away and let it fall down my shirt, then I spend the next 3 minutes licking my lips. Yeah, I have a problem.
