Had a living social deal, it was about to expire, and I wanted to use it. Unfortunately, it didn't apply for take out. The girl who answered rudely informed me. I checked the coupon and nowhere did it say "dine in only" or "not for take out". I called back and spoke with Ryan, the manager, who was nice enough to let us use the coupon anyway. The fun doesn't end there! I drove down there with my wife and daughter, and my wife ran in to grab the food. As she grabbed the food, not 10 feet from her, talking to another server, the rude girl from earlier said (try and imagine this in your best snotty little 20 something bratty voice) "ugh, I TOLD that guy it didn't apply to take out, I don't know WHY he talked to management about it." And rolled her eyes. All of this in front of my polite, sweet wife who did nothing wrong. I have been here multiple times with my parents, who are regulars at this bar. The food is great, but after this, I will NEVER return here. And you probably shouldn't go here either if you want to use a groupon or a living social or anything like that. Because they treat you like YOU'RE an asshole.   Short version? Don't use a coupon because if you do, they'll treat you like crap.

You ever buy donuts and eat one or two when they're still fresh, then go back 6 hours later for another one? Not as good, right? That's not the case here! The first time I had their donuts, a coworker had brought some in. Had one first thing in the morning and it was delicious, still warm and fresh. But what really blew me away was when I went back for a little late afternoon snack and those donuts were still great. They hadn't gone all stale and gross, still tasted amazing. Five stars, all the way.

Great little shop to grab coffee from if you're in the area. The staff here is always very friendly, and their espresso shots are always a great way to get the blood flowing in the morning.

If you're looking for affordable but tasty Chinese, delivered to your house QUICK, then give them a try. Don't expect 5 star dining, they're not that place. And that's fine. For what it is, it's great. We've been ordering from here for a few years and they never disappoint.

As far as JJ's goes, this one is good. Food is always good and the service is great. They are definitely very fast with their deliveries, which is awesome!

I was using V2 brand ecigs for awhile and enjoyed vaping, and have nothing bad to say about that brand (it's great for beginners, in my opinion), but I kept going back to my cigarettes. So, I decided I may need to upgrade and after some searching for a local shop, I found this place. It's a bit of a drive for me, but after my first visit, I felt it was worth it for the convenience and the excellent customer service I received.  I walked in and was greeted warmly by the owner and explained to him I was looking to upgrade to something better than what I had. I purchased two eGo-T kits, and after doing extensive research online, I've found his kits are very well priced and competitive with what you can get online, except at Butt Out, you get to walk out with your new kit in hand. I received a battery, a usb charger cable, and a clearomizer with a bottle of liquid with each kit. He showed me how they work, let me sample a bunch of flavors and even stayed a bit past closing time to make sure I was satisfied.   I liked this place so much, I went back and bought an eGo-C Twist kit the next week and purchased a kit for a coworker. I have been referring all my ecig using friends to this place, and will continue to do so. Their customer service, price, and selection is top notch. If you are looking for a place to buy locally, look no further. You will get what you want and they are also very knowledgable if you are new to vaping. And also, thanks to Butt Out helping me get a good setup, I am three weeks cigarette free. Five stars all the way.

This is my regular spot. They are right up the road from my home, so location is perfect. The people are very friendly, very knowledgable, and they have a great selection. They run daily deals and even have a rewards program for frequent customers. Give them a shot, you won't be disappointed.

If places like this were around right when I turned 21, I would be a regular. As a working parent, I don't get out as often but this place is a little slice of home. It's got all kinds of games, and plenty of space to socialize with friends. The selection of games here is absolutely awesome and they're free to play, so that's cool. This is a wonderful concept and I hope more people give this place a shot. It's a gamer/geek bar, so don't expect the best food or drinks, but what they have is good. All these people giving it one or two stars are being way too nit picky. Come here for the games, stay for the good times with friends. You definitely won't regret it.

Went to see if they had any liquid for my ecig and whoever was there was watching tv with someone on a couch and acted like I was bothering him by coming in and didn't have any knowledge about the products I was looking at. I asked what they were and if he knew if any of them were good and he just shrugged and said "I dunno, I don't use that stuff." I understand if you don't personally use every item in your store, but you should at least be a little more knowledgable about the things you carry and maybe try and act a little more friendly in the future. I don't need sunshine and rainbows, but at least don't look annoyed that I just interrupted what you were doing.  Suffice to say, I won't be returning here.
