I had high expectations with the line out the door. Maybe the other food is good but the lamb burger was completely dried out, the Greek sauce on top was a joke it was disgusting with huge chunks of onion and no flavor, the bun was flavorless as well maybe skip their specialties and stick with the common menu.

I am surprised to see there is another Lisa s but we are different people! I too had a very good experience with Dr Hunt and my hormone replacement. I was referred to her by my regular doctor and between the two of them they dialed in my hormones and thyroid and I have never felt better. Dr Hunt is very knowledgeable when it comes to hormones I was previously getting injections and they started to not work as well. dr. hunt explained to me why I should try a different method and that it would be more effective and she was absolutely correct. I am NOT a needy person so I don't need bedside manner the way others might. I need a doctor that's knowledgeable and effective which is really what's important when choosing.
