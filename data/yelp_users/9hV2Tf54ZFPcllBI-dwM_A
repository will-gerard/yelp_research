Nice place over all.  The beer is good.  Other than beer, I have only had the nachos and they were average/tasty.  The waitresses are always friendly and helpful.  The restaurant is comfortable and they also have a nice out door patio.  The beer sampler is a good way to start your beer quest!

As far as Taco Bell go, this place is pretty great (you could say it is .....  SUPREME! Ha).     The place is clean, the staff is friendly and smiley, they speak English I can understand, and the drive thru is always open. What more do you need? Of the 5 or so times that I have been here I don't think they've ever messed up my order at all -- which is pretty great considering it is a Taco Bell!

The staff, doctors, PAs, RNs, etc are mostly great!  They are very quick, efficient, low waiting time (if there is any), great location, able to see you same day (if you call 8am - 8:30am), and all around exceed expectations..... The only reason I did not rate this business 5/5 is because when I have called the main line to make an appointment or to request a follow up phone call, the receptionists can be curt.  I understand they have business to conduct, but speaking as if you are mid-bite into a sandwich,yelling to background noise while on the phone, and being short is a difficult combination to tolerate..... especially when there are so many other places to go to in North Scottsdale.  I will continue going there, I think they are a great group of doctors / medical professionals, and I am overall very happy with Paradise Valley Family Medicine.

I like this place overall - MOST of the staff is great and the food is consistently yummy.  I especially enjoy the home fries and their thick bacon slices!  Bloody Mary's are filled with horseradish and kind of pricey IMO at $5-$7, but are nice for a treat every once and a while.  Also, they have great coffee and a dog friendly patio.  If you're trying it out for the first time, get a yelp deal or SOME type of deal, take a leap, and dive into the bagels head first!

The owner is a great guy, very friendly, takes time to explain things, and gives you what you need!   I bought a bike for my younger brother, which he rode around a bit, and decided he wanted something a little more rugged -- we brought it back (with a flat tire and slightly bent rim - whoops!) and the owner offered to swap it out for a comparable bike, helped my brother pick one, and adjusted the seat --- DID I MENTION THIS WAS ALL WITHIN 3 MINUTES OF CLOSING TIME!?  He stayed a little late to help us and then even recommended a restaurant close by (Wagon Wheel - figures, right?)   This area is shady, but the owner and the store is not!  5/5 all the way!  :)

Solid Wendy's location. I come here for lunch sometimes and the food is hot, quick and the order is correct.   the workers are nice enough and they even asked if I wanted ketchup in the drive thru which is almost unheard of these days!  The new burgers, french fries and brewed iced tea is my personal favorite!

I haven't visited for lunch - which apparently I am missing out on based on the reviews below!   Anyway, I have been twice for a dinner and it has been sub-par.  Most recently I visited this past weekend 8/24/13.  Sure, they may have the cool fire and loud, clanging spatulas - but it seems like more gimmicky than anything; I would take Benihana over Kyoto any day. Also, the staff we had both times were also sub-par.... which truly fulfills the need for this restaurant to be rated "Meh. I've experienced better."

I have never had a good experience with the pharmacy here -- long wait, short staffed, complaining, takes hours for a prescription..... No thank you!   There is another CVS open across the road (NE Scottsdale/ Shea) that has a better pharmacy and is 24 hours....   This store is newer, decently stocked, and the CVS front desk staff are nice.  However, if you are looking for a quick pop-in somewhere, circle K across the street may be a better option.  :P

Great lunch specials!   I always get the Chicken Caprese Pita with a side salad which is only around $6.50 including tax.  The food is consistently tasty and they have a solid menu.  They also have a full bar and a nice patio area outside.   Sometimes the service is slow if you sit down at the tables so I always sit at the bar for lunch.

Food is acceptable, service is terrible.   I have eaten at this restaurant three times; twice for lunch and once for dinner.  Each time I have visited this restaurant, the service leaves something to be desired such as...... decent service. It takes 3-10 minutes to be acknowledged by the hostess once you are at the restaurant, time to be seated (even when there are only a few patrons), and even longer to be acknowledged by any one to take a beverage order.  The staff makes you feel as if they are doing YOU a favor by even talking to you/taking your order and the general ambiance is bland.  Once I called to ask if a reservation was needed, the hostess said no and hung up on me.   When we arrived we requested to sit outside and we were informed that the tables were all reserved / taken for the night.  During the whole night and the two hours it took to eat, the patio was less than half full.  For the most part, the staff is unprofessional, took time chit chatting instead of helping people and seemed immature.  The waitresses were the only ones that worked and polite, but the kitchen and overall service is very slow.  I do not recommend this place for lunch if you have any time constraints.  The last time I visited, the two parties on my right and left each had issues with either the service or the billing and the manager had to speak with them.   The food, overall, is decent and some items are over priced.  One member of our party ordered ravioli which was $20; the issue was that the plate had a total of 5 medium sized raviolis and they were still hungry after an appetizer and dinner course (that's $4 for each piece of a medium sized no-frills ravioli!!).  The appetizer of basic bruschetta for two is $12 and fries are $8.  I had the beef burger twice; once it was very dry and the second time it was good.  I would probably be fine with the prices, if the service was not so bad.  One note.... The menu varies from day to day so you may want to check their web site prior to going to make sure they are serving what you like on that day.  However, don't always expect to have their daily offered selections available.  I went once with my mother at 5pm and she tried to order a chicken dinner.  The waitress stated they had ran out of chicken! At 5pm!  The restaurant was not even that busy and that was one of their 6 main courses offered that day.    I will not be going back here a 4th time.  If you are planning on going to Mill Ave in Tempe to eat....   there are a lot more restaurants available that offer better food, prices, and service than Cafe Boa.

I wanted to get my Mercedes-Benz W126 S-Class car looked at for a while since it ran sluggish, had red nail polish split everywhere, slightly scorched upholstery  and had ice cream residue on the ceiling.  The final straw came when my mother smashed it into a wall in our underground parking lot in another one of her drunken stupors (aka post 6:00 am).  After that, I just decided - I HAD to get this car fixed.    I asked my husband for help, but he said he was too busy perusing his dreams of becoming an "Actor" to even drop the car off at the shop!  How rude!  So, one day when I finally made it out of bed before 5:00 pm (it's OK - I'm a stay in bed mom), I took my Mercedes to Tobias' Automotive Specialists to get it checked out.   The guys at this shop were great - they were so nice, professional, and did outstanding work.  I do have to admit, I was a little saddened when neither Chuck, Chris, or Jason commented on my amazing Sh√©male shirt.    I can genuinely say, thank you Tobias!  Maybe even my daughter will be excited for once now that we have our car back!

Great place!    The decor is a little tacky, but the good food, pitchers of beer, and super staff make up for it.  They serve beer in the coldest mugs ever!  The beer literally had little ice particles in it and it was only $8 for a large pitcher.  Also, they have great lunch specials and the regular prices are decent too.  Lots of items to pick from from pizza (of course) to wings to like 10 different types of pasta.  Good, laid back place for kids or large groups too.

I have eaten at Fuego Bistro many times and each time is AMAZING!!! I have tried most things on the menu from spicy beef empanadas to the NY strip steak or the slow roasted pork. Everything I have ever had at this place is phenomenal. They flavor their food in unique ways I would never even think of and it turns out great.  The sides are delicious too (example: try the Green Chili Cornbread Casserole and Chipotle Cheddar Mashed Potato). I typically do not enjoy desserts, but they have a Chocolate Torte with ice cream that melts in your mouth (yes, that means you should get it!). I very rarely write reviews, but this place is totally worth it! The staff is very pleasant and you can usually catch the owner, Jeff, sauntering around. Every person I have introduced to this restaurant is blown away. One tip: The food does take a little longer to prepare than Jack in the Box, so allow a lunch break longer than 30 minutes to allow time to order, receive and enjoy your food. Also, if you are planning on going on a busy night like Friday or Saturday, I would suggest you call ahead to ensure a reservation since it is a smaller restaurant. I first found out about this restaurant a few months ago through a promotion and once you try it, you'll be hooked too.  They also participated in Restaurant Week in 2010 and I hope they do it again in 2011!

Ok, yes, this area is totally thug life: do not get out of your car if possible.   However -- out of all of the Carl's Jr locations I have been to, this one has the best food and the nicest staff.  They have never made an error on our order, the ice tea is delicious (and cheap!), the food is hot and fresh, and if I am unfortunate enough to be in the area again --- I will totally go back here for a quick bite!

I went here for happy hour today and I was very pleased!  The restaurant is beautiful, the waiter was attentive, the food was great, the chips/salsa were complementary, and the beer was cold, frosty, and delicious -- what more could one want?!!??  The happy hour deal is AMAZING (half off appetizers, $2 beer, $4 large margaritas.... awesome!).  I would go back in a heart beat to the happy hour; however, I am unable to comment on the regular service (I'm assuming it is a little more expensive, but great overall!  :) ) Also, they have a GREAT patio that I would love to check out during the fall time.  Lastly, my mom also loved the food, food, salsa, and layout of the restaurant -- very impressive that it appealed to both of us!     I was full, content, and happy after said happy hour here.  I will definitely be back soon!

They get 5 out of 5 starts for their Monday - Wednesday SUPER AWESOME 2 meals for $14.99 deal!  That is right, kiddos, ALL DAY -- not just limited to lunch.  My co-worker and I have become weekly regulars and the staff is always polite, nice, and considerate.  If there is ever a problem, they quickly correct it and are very receptive to special requests.   Seriously, where else can you get a steak dinner for $7.50 each AND get to throw peanuts on the floor without your mom yelling at you or you having to clean them up!?  Also, the unlimited, free, hot, buttery, melt-y, and delicious sweet dinner rolls are AMAZING!  (note: do not check calorie content of the rolls before visiting.... it will ruin the pure bliss enjoyed while devouring the rolls).  Also, you can opt for healthier options here much easier than you can a burger place (salad, chicken or steak, and steamed broccoli easily does the trick!)  Overall, even without the super amazing deal Monday - Friday, I enjoy this place and will continue to go back.  (p.s. did I mention the free rolls!?)

Food was a solid 4/5, staff is great, they serve booze at a decent price throughout the day (aww, yea!),   My friend and I split a salad and a pizza about 2 weeks ago which was really great!  ....Then, last week, we had an office party with food catered from this location.  I want to be honest with you all:  DO NOT GET THE THIN CRUST......   I tried the Pesto Chicken Pizza with thin crust and the crust was basically like a crisp (Which I am not a fan of... If I wanted a one-sided quesadilla, I would spent $5 at Fredericos).  My side salad was good and THE BRUSCHETTA IS FUCKING AWESOME!!!!!!!  I do recommend going to this location, getting some booze and amazing bruchetta..... for that, I thank you!!

I went here with my younger brother last weekend, and, IT WAS AWESOME.  I had not visited this location, but I had a hungry 15 year old on my hands and a coupon full of pockets.    I got a bagel - he got a breakfast sandwich - and all the food was good!  The drinks were on spot and the shift manager was oh-so-sweet and oh-so-kind.  She put up with our indecisive ways, was actually warm/friendly (shocker for Scottsdale), happily accepted said coupons, seemed genuine, and her cohort in coffee crime was great too.   So, thanks Dunkin!  I will definitely be back!

This place is SO good and I am SO FULL!   I visited this restaurant tonight and was very pleased overall.  They have good happy hour deals, great food, and AWESOME staff/service!  Everyone from my mother to my younger brother were happy with their plates and the staff is some of the friendliest I have ever met.  I will definitely be back soon.  :)

So, so, SO good!  And the owner is amazing - so warm, friendly, AND the head chef.  I had a great mojito and chicken/veggie spring rolls appetizer.   It is kind of hidden in the middle/towards the back of a strip mall area at Scottsdale and Shea -- find it; IT IS WORTH IT.  The restaurant is small, intimate, dark, and would be a great date spot (however, I was allllll byyy myyyseeeeeellllff).  It is a super cute place that I am planning on returning to with my mom in the next week or two.  The prices are comparable for North Scottsdale.

I like Fresh and Easy in general....  But I really like this one since it is right beside my house!  They have great pre-made food for a quick on the go meal or pre-packaged items to make an easy dinner for a family.  The prices are reasonable, but there are great deals if you have their weekly coupon (sign up for their weekly email!) or if you get the discounted food that they are trying to get off the shelves late at night.   They also have a sweeet-tah wine and beer section with decent prices.  I also enjoy that when I go to look for something, for example paper towels, there are like 4 choices instead of 4 million that I would find at Walmart (seriously, people, who needs THAT many choices?!).  I like just that they keep it to just the basics, which, in turn, makes my shopping headache free, simpler, and quicker.    No long lines, nice staff, easy to understand products/labeling, fresh veggies, and it is easy to get in and out.  I'll keep shopping there! (as long as they continue to let me in.... jk).

I honestly don't understand why everyone rants and raves about this place.  It is a sub shop that is ran by unhelpful and rushed college kids.  They do not allow many choices and its kind of similar to in-and-out (regarding the atmosphere, not food).  They received 2 stars instead of 1 becaues they are very fast which is good if you are in a rush for lunch.

Fast, clean, highly operational, NEWEST technology... The staff were ALL friendly, personable, and helpful from the receptionist to the nurse to the MRI scanner dood, to the PA to the doctor on hand.  Great location close to the 101 (also down the street from my house!!).   My only complaint is -- As the night went on, the staff became a little rowdy and began singing a few pop songs (granted, it was 5am in the morning and I am known to get rowdy at 5pm at a desk job...).  I am glad they get along well (better than being hostile in a work environment!) -- but I was trying to sleep.  However, I would trade a few minutes of upbeat pop songs sung glee-style for the great care I received.  Also, it took a little while to get my MRI done since they were backed up (totally took care of me while waiting though!).   Overall, great experience (considering the dire circumstances) and I will post if any additional updates.  Everyone really appeared friendly, caring, and compassionate -- which is great when you're in a time of need.  Also, they took time to explain things which I appreciated!

We ordered delivery for the first time from this restaurant last week and it was great!  You can do all of your ordering online which I thought was super helpful - and - they delivered until 10pm!!.   We had the sweet and sour chicken (5/5), chicken with cashew nuts (5/5), curry chicken with onions (4/5) and spring rolls (3/5).  The rice came with each of the main dishes and was delicious!  The curry did not taste milky-ish as I have become accustomed to and enjoy, but instead was on the watery side and had a lot of bell pepper flavor. Overall good and I will definitely be back in person!

One word comes to mind..... YUM!  Everyone is ranting and raving about the burgers (which are  scrumptious), but you need to try the subs here too!!!  The subs here are amazing!  They are a great price and you get a lot of sub for your buck.  The meat, bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, etc are stuffed into delicious whole wheat bread (they have other types of bread too) and the toppings practically over flow out of the sandwich.  This place is great because they have different types of food to please almost any one and it is all delish.  They have a good selection including burgers, subs, mini corn dogs, salads, gyros, fries, onion rings, etc etc that are all custom made to order.  The burgers are great and I tried the "moo-yorker" on a whim which was delicious.  The fries are fresh cut on site and the kitchen is open.  They also have a HUGE soda collection that has many different types of specialty sodas from all over the place.   I have gone to this restaurant many times and the atmosphere is laid back, casual, and down to the basics.  Good place to go if you have kids.  However, it is a smaller restaurant with limited seating. Also, if you are trying to impress a pretentious date this is probably not the spot for you. The people that work here are all very friendly, helpful, and has a family owner-ship vibe.    Basically.....  This restaurant has yummy food and great prices.  I definitely recommend that you stop by if your in the area!

No. Noooo thank you.  My friend ranted and raved about this place - it sounded good, close to work, and I was in the mood for some BBQ.  I purchased a pulled chicken BBQ sandwich, side of mac and cheese, and.... waffle fries I think (obviously, unforgettable). Within the first bite of my chicken sammich, I found a chicken joint thing within the chicken.... There was only a bun, pulled chicken, and bone fragments (no additional toppings).  They did have a lot of different types of sauces and they were great (hence the two stars instead of one)!  The mac and cheese was super bland and mushy.  The actual restaurant is near deer valley airport, in an office plaza, and has an industrial feel to the inside.  If you really like BBQ, check it out, but check the food before you take your first bite!

I'm a lunch regular here.... there are some pros and cons, but overall the pros keep me coming back!!!  Cons: Order issues; about a quarter of the time the order is slightly wrong.  This may be to the menu since it varies and, to their credit, it is always corrected promptly with an apology.  Also, this is a newer restaurant that opened in 2010 (I believe) and they may not have everything perfected quite yet.  Portions; the portions are sufficient for me, but I'm not sure some of my other lunch partners are "stuffed".   Pros: Food; great!   They use local, organic, and free range ingredients as much as possible and you can taste the great quality in the food.  The food is always fresh, flavored wonderfully, and delicious.  I usually get the chicken sandwich with bacon on ciabatta bread.  The dessert, soup, and appetizers are also good.  Appearance; the restaurant has an open layout, modern, bright, crisp and clean (the bathrooms are modern and clean too!).  The decor is really cute and offers comfortable seating.  Staff; always very friendly, helpful, cheerful, and accommodating.  Food prep time is appropriate and usually 5-10 minutes.  Coffee; really good!  It is smooth and delicious and they offer it hot or cold.  All of their water is purified and all of the beverages turn out great as a result.  Environment; very relaxed, peaceful, and you are not rushed.  There is also a nice patio area if you wish to sit outside.  I originally found this place because I had a coupon and I have continued to come back for lunch.  The prices are reasonable and they offer lunch specials.  Everyone I have introduced to this place has been pleased.... I suggest you try it too!

Best thing about this place?!  24 HOUR PHARMACY, BABY!!!  That means, day, or night you can get the hook-up on your doctor prescribed meds.  Also, the store, while it is an older store, has a lot of stuff you can look at and buy while waiting for said meds.  Also, one pharmacist in particular is AMAZING and went out of her way to assist me (will post name when I can find it - definitely deserves props).....  Not so great thing? Pharmacy --  No drive through service for drop off or pick up.  :(   They are ALWAYS busy so be expected to wait 30++ and probably deal with some one frazzled (hit or miss, like most places).   The store is a little older, but they have a great alcohol selection and nice staff (that makes almost all the difference....)  Not many pharmacies and stores around here are 24 hours, so that is why they get a 4/5!

Great store! It was closing time and I just needed to pick up one item. The manager was so nice and let me in to grab what I needed. He went an extra step to help out a customer when it would have been easier just to say "Sorry, we are closed" and shut the door. Even though it was after hours, ALL of the staff were in a good mood and very friendly.   Also, the store is clean and well put together. Lots of merchandise. Good location in the Arrowhead area with tons of other shopping very close. From the phone rep to the manager to the cashier all of the staff is super friendly and helpful. I will definitely keep shopping there....!

I checked this place out for the first time due to a coupon at work (YAY coupons!).  I had turkey and provolone on wheat "Mike's Way" (onions, lettuce, tomatoes, olive oil blend, red wine vinegar and spices).    I was kind of cautious about having it "Mike's Way" since I usually load my sub up with olives, red onions, pickles, tomatoes, cucumbers, ranch, salt/pepper and everything else almost under the sun -- however, since the veggies were SO good, crisp, fresh, ripe, etc, the meat plentiful and the bread was great - it was perfect.    Also, the staff were super friendly.... My only regret is that I did not pick up napkins!  So, thanks! I'll be back for sure!  The regular sub was a perfect size for lunch.  :)

Yes!  My steak was perfect and delicious..... Mmm... Steak.  I had the 8 ounce filet mignon with broccoli.   I also had the heirloom tomato salad as an appetizer - the small tomatoes, cheese, and drizzle was great, but the larger tomatoes did not have much flavor and didn't seem fully ripened. I posted a picture; beautiful looking salad.    Service was great and the music was a perfect touch.  I would love to come back some time to try their happy hour!

I've taken many pups here a few times over the course of 6+ years - including a momma dog with partial born/ miscarried puppies, a dog for spaying, general check ups, micro chip checking on strays, etc. Full service. No appointments. Minimal waiting.  A few things are consistent - the veterinarian knows what he is doing, no frills, no bullshit, he is direct, expertly serves your animal's needs.... And then is on to the next animal.  Yes, it will be a crowed office (leash/ cage needed) and it will smell like pee / animals (I'd be concerned if it didn't!?!?)  Now, if you want someone who up charge you on B.S. (because they can - it's a beloved pet), panders hours to you, tries things that probably won't work and charges you 3-4 times as much (albeit, in a new office)..... Then this is not the place to go to; seriously - save your time.... Instead go to a doggie spa and maybe they have some herbal remedies that can perhaps prevent cancer in your dog.    For me, personally, my main concern is having my pups cared for by a wise, but direct veterinarian -- but everyone has their own prerogative.  I originally came here to check on hours since I will be traveling from Scottsdale this weekend to bring my dog, Cleo, in for a hip issue.... Glad I could give my two yelp cents though.    Be realistic people; this is a great established vet that works with people and has a  passion for animals - not to gouge people.  Message me if any further questions.

Nom-nom-nom-NOM!!  I love this place.  It is a small corner restaurant in an office building so it doesn't stand out too much -- but it worth looking for!    I have been there 10+ times with co-workers and I have tried everything from the wraps to the salad to the chicken shawarma; it all delicious and made to order.  The place is cute too because they have little extra things you can buy in case you need something kind of random, but don't want to go to a second place on your lunch break (think sides of hummus, slim jims, canned soda, candy, snacks, gum, advil, heartburn tablets, an office item or two, etc).  They also have breakfast, but I have not tried it yet (due to no fault of theirs; I am just not a breakfast person).   The owner, Ken, is ahhhh-mazing, so sweet, and remembers people after the first or second visit! The food is consistently good, tastes home made, and the prices are very affordable.  It is a perfect place to stop in if you forgot your lunch, only have a few minutes, or want something satisfying - you can also call ahead your order so it is ready to go!    It is right beside my work and, while it took me about a year to find out about, I am glad I eventually found it!

Omg, om-nom-nom-nom!!!!!  I typically do not eat BBQ, but sweet mother mary of jesus....YES, YES, YES!    Why is this place so awesome?  1. I actually met the grill master THAT GRILLED MY FOOD!  I met the man behind the delicious-ness that was my meal; he is amazing. 2. The staff/bartenders are cool.as.shit.  Seriously, they work in old town Scottsdale AND they are nice / pleasant / outgoing / cordial / amazing.  Do you know how hard that is to find in Old Town Scottsdale?  3. They were really nice to my mom.... That gets kudos in my book. 4. All of the food was super fantastic - from the salmon to the all-your-fat-ass-can-eat-Sunday-special (which I got); it was all ahhh-mazing!  My mom literally ate her entire salmon fillet, rice pilaf, corn husk, and licked the plate so hard I think she bore a hole in it.  I ate the pork butt sliders + coleslaw + ribs + chicken + yes = happy Siobhan.  5. I randomly found this place through Groupon and I am very pleasantly surprised.  :)  6. They have a sweet happy hour from 5pm to 7pm....half off appetizers + cheap drinks.... Will you marry me Mr. Western?  In conclusion, this is a newer place with live music, awesome food, and even better staff.  So.... Sweet mother mary of jesus, YES, YES, YES!    My mom loved it, I loved it, my brother loved the left overs.....and we will be back.  :)   Thanks you guys!!

Sooooo good. Their gluten free buns are AMAZING!! The buns are similar to corn bread and.... basically fucking delicious.

New place that just opened last week - very cute design, the open patio will be awesome once it cools down a bit, and they have great beer / wine specials.  Plus, the super friendly staff and sweet location to my house doesn't hurt either!  Food is great -- who doesn't love pizza made your way?? Lol.    The pizza was tasty, the salad was fresh, the cheese was delish' and all of the ingredients were very fresh.  I got the Spicy Butcher (YUM!) and the Hot Hawaiian.

Not a fan of this place.  It is loud, hard to walk down the isles (tables are really really close together), food is mediocre AT BEST and I feel like I am ordering at a school cafeteria.  Paradise Bakery has a similar set up to their restaurant, but the food is worth it.  It is usually busy, so some people must like it (it is affordable) -- but the food is very bland and lacks zest in my opinion.  No complaints about the staff though.  :)    My friends like this place, but I just can not stand going here due to the food; I've tried it about 4 separate times. There are so, so, so many other more flavorful restaurants to go to in walking distance.

Best car rental experience EVER!  First, it has GREAT hours in comparison with the other car rental locations (excluding the 24 hour airport), consistently super nice staff, low wait times, great price (online) and I drove the cutest little Fiat.  They are also right beside my house - which doesn't hurt!  (side note: I found a cheaper rate online compared to what they quoted me over the phone, but I think that is pretty typical for rental companies....).   I will definitely be back next time I need a rental car.  :)  Thanks!

Wow.... Just.... Wow.  There are some angry people on here!  I originally came here looking for Mr. Troncellito's phone number to provide my mother to refer her to his office.  I dealth with him in early 2011 and I was originally referred to him by a friend.  I can honestly say I did not have any issues with Mike or any member in his office.  He took my small claims case, was very friendly, charismatic, not aggressive, quick-witted, did not use any off-beat analogies (I mean, who really enjoys sour milk?), and did a great job overall.  Also, his office was very clean, nicely set up, and his staff members are efficient -- they get the job done.   If you have any questions or want proof that he helped me out with a case in time of need (i.e. this is not spam), feel free to message me directly.

This place is awesome, but the music blows. I wish they would change it.

This weekend was the first time I used Sunrise Cab and they were excellent both times!  Yes, the cars are older.  BUT!  The fares are cheaper, drivers are nice, very efficient, arrived on time, and called a minute before the pickup.  I am pleased with the experience and I will definitely use them next time!  Note: they only take cash, but they don't mind stopping at an ATM.
