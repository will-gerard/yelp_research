Asian style ramen and noodles.. Udon Suki and tan tan men are very good.. Even though I like this place, it's just a drive for us so I can't come here as often as I like.. The parking is small so good luck in finding parking when it gets busy..

My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate our 1 year anniversary on a recommendation from one of my friends.. I have to say it's one of the best steak houses we've been too in Phoenix.. We ordered the pan fried calamari with hot peppers which were absolutely delicious.. Then we ordered The Porcini Rubbed Bone-In Ribeye and the porter steak and a side of mashed potatoes.. Both steaks were amazing but both my boyfriend and I enjoyed the porcini rubber bone in ribeye a little bit more.. The ppl who worked there were amazing.. They decorated our table along with getting a free glass of champagne and a sampler of a small chocolate cake and cheese cake complimentary for our anniversary..This place is AMAZING!!

Came here a couple times on Tuesdays when they have their Tuesday's special.. This place is okay.. It's cheap when you come for their Tuesday's special I feel my manicure or pedi chip a lot faster than where I usually go.. If your on a budget this place isn't bad.. But the water they put in are extremely hot so be careful when you test the water to put ur feet in for the pedicure .. It has happened every time I came here so be careful..

Tried their pizza muffin for the first time which was delicious.. My friend ordered the lunch calzone and drink for $6 and got more than her money's worth.. The waiter was nice and kept checking on us..

For fast Mexican food I like coming here and I always end up getting the chicken, potato and cheese.. The chicken is already spicy to start with which makes the burrito taste even better .. I just wish they had more locations around ..

This place is good reminds me how my dad makes them.. If you don't want to pay the 0.35 charge bring cash.. Heard the suicide wings is less spicer than the hot..

Always come to this Dutch bros location bc it's open 24 hours.. And it's the only coffee shop open when I'm on my way to work .. The only thing is a little annoying is they always try to have a conversation.. I just want my coffee lol

We ordered 2 14inch pizza for delivery which costed 15.99... It was a special they were having.. Online it said it was going to be 45 min wait but it turned out to be 30 min.. Which was nice.. The pizza it self wasn't bad , if i need to order pizza again in the future now I know to have other options around my neighborhood than dominos or papa johns..

Affordable prices :) love this place.. The owner of this place has expanded the restaurant which was a great idea since they are always busy.. The parking lot is small but there is parking in the back.. This place gets busy but their food is good ..

The food was your average breakfast items.. The only issue we had was staff.. They were too busy chit chatting behind the counter.. It took them forever to bring us the bill.. They were too busy discussing what ppl were saying about them on Yelp then checking on their customers..

Great atmosphere, good service and always have the best pizza .. Every time I crave pizza I love coming here..  The staff are friendly and I never had a bad experience here yet.. If you enjoy spinatos you'll enjoy the food here as well

Came to try this place out with my boyfriend and wasn't really impressed.. He got a birthday cake milkshake which wasn't great.. He said rather go to cold stone to get theirs.. I got the Gelati which consisted of ur choice Italian ice and custard.. It just tasted like Bahama Bucks rip off?!? I guess there are just better places to get the stuff Rita's was selling..

Youfit is great if you are just looking for a small gym to join.. I don't feel like I'm competing with anybody when I come here.. I just wish they offer some classes at all their locations not limit it to one or two locations but other than that I like coming to youfit to workout.

Came here for my sisters last minute birthday get together.. They had very friendly staff that checked up on us often .. And we made just in time for happy hour which ends at 6:30.. The food was pretty good, I just ordered a Cobb salad with wine and the orange blossom beer.. And I got a chicken sandwich to go for my boyfriend which he enjoyed.. Everyone at the table were satisfied with their meals.. We ordered my sister a few shots on recommendations from our waiter .. They were nice enough to put one of the shots on their tab for my sister since it was her birthday.. They also brought out a DIY smores dessert for a birthday treat.. I'll defin will be back..

This place was overs all good.. The vindaloo could have been a little bit spicer for my taste but still delicious.. This place is a nice and cozy restaurant with good service.. The garlic nann was good and the appetizer vegetable samosa was good as well.. The only thing I have to say is that the water has little white water particles floating inside the water.. So order a soda or another drink..

We came here tonight for my sisters birthday get together and let me just say the food was really good and the staff was so nice and they checked up on us often which was great.. The waitress was very nice and she answered any questions we had.. My boyfriend  and I ordered the rib eye special and the cheese,sausage and bread appetizer .. The rib eye special came with two corn on the cob and side of spicy potato salad which was really good.. The only thing I probably have to take a half a star off is that their soft drink selection is very limited and it comes in a small glass coke bottles which is $2 a piece.. It's not expensive but it does add up if you want more soda.. Other than that we all enjoyed this place.. Last thing, I believe they only take up to 4 cards so if you come with a group bring cash and also they don't do the automatic gratuity if U have 6 or more which I think is great..

This place was pretty good... We ordered the spicy miso ramen and yakisoba.. My BF ordered the pork belly buns which was on their special for the day.. The pork belly itself was pretty good but wished they added more meat..

This is one of many Starbucks by my apartment.. This Starbucks is nice to come to bc it's right by a grocery store and it has a drive thru.. And it's nice and spacious inside.. I always stop at this one when I'm coming home from work or after grocery shopping.. Never a long wait at the drive thru.

I don't know how I didn't know about this place before.. This place is very big with indoor and outdoor seating.. They have happy hour Monday thru Friday 2-5... My friend and I ordered the Korean shrimp and chicken, pretzel Fondue and pork belly nachos .. I got two beers and my friend had the sangria which all came out to be about $32.. They have few games outside like corn hole and ping pong .. We loved the atmosphere and the food was pretty good

Always a fun time here at top golf ..the only thing I do have to say negatively is there is always a long wait the few times we have gone.. But they do have a few things you can do while you wait.. You can either enjoy drinks at the bar or go down stairs to play pool or play wii.. But we always have fun while we are here and the food they offer aren't bad..

I like coming here to get my nails done.. They are always friendly and always busy usually after 2pm or so. I never had any issues with anybody that worked on my nails .. Their prices are about average if u just want to get a pedi and gel manicure..

Overall the food wasn't bad but it was just average.. I would personally go to burrito express instead if u are just interested in getting a burrito.. They taste better.. The only bad thing I do have to say is that they call u by ur number to pick up food but if your sitting outside you have no way of knowing if ur food is ready unless you occasionally check which sucks..

Came here for a friends birthday dinner.. He made reservations for 12 but when we got there we were taken to a table that only sat 8 ppl we had to ask for another table to add to ours.. Thankfully some ppl weren't able to come so it ended up working out but still... How do u seat a party of 12 that clearly only seats 8?? The waitress started off nice but as the night went one it took longer and longer for her to check up on us and she also became very rude.... It sucked that 20% gratuity was automatically added bc we has more than 6..  When we moved outside (they turned off the air conditioning !!!, we had to ask them to turn it back on) because we got so hot, the only sitting that fit our party was around a fountain. We asked if they can wipe down the chairs bc we didn't want to sit in water she made a smart a$$ remark saying "your sitting near water, ur going to get wet.." The food was eh.. The sliders were probably the best item that anyone ordered.. The jalapeño and cheese potato dumplings and cheese/potato dumplings weren't bad... But everything was bland.. Just FYI if you go with a big party they only except TWO cards or just cash... So come prepared.. Oh yeh, the parking options around the restaurant sucks if your going there in the evening..

This place was very clean and had friendly staff.. The food was good, my BF and I ordered Thai egg rolls, calamari and Thai fried rice.. And we liked it that it closed half an hour later during their lunch hours compared to most places that closed at 2:30.. We will definitely come back here..

This place is inside the Hilton hotel in downtown phx. It's small but very cute and modern decor.. The food was a lil pricey but overall everything tasted delicious.. No one in our group was complaining about their meal. And our waitress came around often which was great.

Saw this place on Yelp and had to check it out.. This place is tucked away all the way in the corner in the big lots plaza.. When we first got here this place was empty but we came here after the lunch rush.. The staff are friendly here and most of everything they make here is freshly made everyday which I like.. Everything that we had here was delicious, no complaints.. You get free house bread when you check in on Yelp..

My BF and I tried this place out after seeing my sister come here few days ago.. This restaurant is very spacious .. Overall the food was pretty good.. I ordered the kimchi stew with pork belly which was delicious and satisfied my cravings.. My boyfriend ordered the spicy chicken, it wasn't bad but had better at Hodori.. We did like the variety of side dishes they offered but my boyfriend was kinda disappointed that they didn't have the potato one..

I saw this place show up on Yelp and went to check it out with my boyfriend.. This location has only been open for only two weeks so they had a few things out to put together.. Overall the staff was pretty nice they greeted us right away.. My boyfriend and I ordered chocolate doughnut with chocolate glazed, chocolate glazed with fruity pebbles on top, original glazed , a big cinnamon roll type of doughnut.. They have us a strawberry glazed with fruity pebbles on top for free which I thought it was nice of them.. Their doughnuts are good but I think some of them will taste better if we got them while they were still fresh.. Couple of our doughnuts were a lil dry but other than that this place was good.. Just have to remember to come earlier in the day next time..
