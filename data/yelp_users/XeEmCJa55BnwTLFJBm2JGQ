WOW! That is the first word that comes to mind. I called to make a lunch business meeting reservation and you'd thought I was asking them to sponsor the lunch! I was told that they really don't like business meetings taking place because of shift change and how long they take. I reacted with asking him if I should seek another restaurant to make my reservation that can accommodate the meeting. He rebutted with "well I have your name down" and then click. This bothered me so I called back to cancel my lunch meeting with the manager. After being "disconnected" once I was finally able to share my story and cancel my reservation with the manager. The manager was really nice though. Yikes, this is not customer service of any kind. It's sad because I really wanted to try something new (sad face)!

Steve and the employees at Swedish Auto Werks took great care of me. I needed a few essential parts fixed on my Volvo XC90 and they knew right what to do. Trust them with your Swedish car and have no regrets that you'll be taken care of!   The free rental car made life extremely easy while fixing my car. They are the real deal!

I had to look this place up because of the disproportionate amount of violations on January 15th 2015 compared to other restaurants on the list. I've never been to the restaurant but 9 VIOLATIONS is a little excessive. Meh...I think not on trying this restaurant!   http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/blog/prime_cuts/2015/01/do-you-eat-here-jan-15-20.html?ana=e_du_wknd&s=article_du&ed=2015-01-31&u=n7%2FCVQ1akxenCCnIchVIjw0eef1010&t=1422906561&page=all
