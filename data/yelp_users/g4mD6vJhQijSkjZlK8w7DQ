Never disappointed, always good!   always on point and delicious. One time a flatbread took a little longer than usual and when he brought it to me he said it would be taken care of. Amazing service like that will always keep my coming back. plus the food is amazing!

amazing coffee.   Carmel macchiato frost is so good and tastes light, doesn't leave you with that Starbucks stomach ache.   I love the coffee but am not a fan of anything else. I get it's a family owned business, but the decor is wayyyyy too much. less is more.   the patio is smoking, which is the worst. it's so nice out there, but I've only ever lasted five minutes before I pack up and leave.   coffee is a 5, atmosphere and patio a 2.

This is for the film lab they are with next door. Not in the actual Tempe Camera building, but next door.   First off, found them quite rude. I had called earlier in the day and discussed film developing and pricing, I told that to the woman working the front desk and she goes 'you called aaaaaanndddd....' in a rude tone. I literally quietly chuckled because it was crazy how rude her tone was.   I develop my 120 film at a pro lab in Utah and California normally, as I am a full time film and wedding photographer. I didn't have time to ship the film out and needed the scans right away, so I had to use one locally.   In terms of scanning quality, not great. Inconsistent from frame to frame, which shouldn't happen that staggeringly considering most of the 5 rolls were shot with the exact same settings. The sharpening setting was on the scanner is up completely too high. Way too sharp and very unflattering.   The color in the scans is way off. Sometimes way too yellow, sometimes way too cyan.   I tried to fix the photos in Lightroom, mostly using exposure, temperature and split toning to counteract their tones.   Overall in image quality, very poor.   Price - $188 for 5 rolls of film done in one day. Timeliness was not a factor, but I paid twice the normal price to make that happen.   Other big issue is the way they deliver the files. They only offer them on a disc. If you have an Apple Mac from the past four or so years, you know that they don't have a disc drive. The lady working suggested I buy a disc reader for my computer. Crazy. So I had to go to an office supply store, buy a USB and bring it back to them. Waited for them to develop and scan and then went back to pick up.   Huge waste of time considering that every other pro lab delivers via Dropbox, WeTransfer or FTP.   I am writing this review because I want them to make it. I want this lab to survive because film is a beautiful and wonderful medium and I have made a living off of it for years.   So I would love to see:  1) Nicer customer service. That was an incredibly rude transaction and weirdly she was a lot nicer when I came to pick up the film. Must have picked up on my shocked facial expression.   2) Better scanning. I heard they use Frontier, great. Noristu and Frontier are what my normal lab offers. But why was I not asked for a profile? Light/dark, warm/cold, sharpness level, etc. All other pro labs offer a custom profile. If they do do this, that wasn't explained.   3) A different delivery method. She made the comment that it would be so expensive to do something like Dropbox. I would argue that it'll cost you more not to in the long run because even if the scans were perfect, I would never drop off and pick up a USB/disc every time. Big inconvenience.   I know multiple all film wedding photographers in the city who spend $10,000-30,000 a year on developing and scanning with out of town labs. Take that business back! Why aren't they developing here? The above issues are 100% why.  Overall, please make these changes and then let us know when you have, we want you to make it!

Love love.   Happy hour is amazing. half priced drinks and the sangria is awesome.   Ordered the steak tacos, pretzel and pigs in a blanket. Perfect spices, sauces and texture.  Food came out warm.   Server was super friendly and even fixed our uneven table without us asking.   Sat on the patio and the ambience is amazing. love the fireplace and the wood. all in all, yay yay yay.

Thai chicken salad is amazing. so is broccoli cheddar soup.   I really want to like the cranberry chicken sandwich but it's not awesome.   Southwest chicken salad is also good.   Their little chocolate chipper cookies are delicious and bite size, way better than they're bigger ones.   Sometimes the line is wayyy too slow but that comes with freshly prepared food.   Overall, love.

AMAZING.   had a bruschetta board.  chose: salami + pesto, prosciutto + figs, apples + Brie, mozzarella + tomatoes.   prosciutto is perfect! it's not like those ones that's are super ham-y tasting. it was authentic and amazing.   my sister said she would bathe in the pesto sauce.   sat the bar with our backs to the patio. perfect setting, usually don't like sitting at bars but it's comfortable.   servers at bar were superrrr nice. and didn't judge us when we asked to order another board. so that's a plus.  had the red blend wine. so delicious. also had a mimosa, at $5 it can't be beat.   this is a perfect place, I will be back. maybe tomorrow.

Really wanted to like this place, really disappointed.   Bruschetta came out cold and tasted like just cold bread and tomatoes. No spice, seemed like a lazy version of bruschetta.   Apple/pear salad would have been okay had it not been for the maple in the vinaigrette. It tasted like maple syrup and ruined the whole salad. My friend and I didn't eat anything of it except for the fruit and the waiter took the plates away with the entire salad still on it, not asking us if something was wrong. Obviously there was.   Had two half dishes, one the chicken and asparagus with risotto and one dish with pasta with marinara. Both incredibly underwhelming.   Risotto wasn't cooked properly, most bites had hard, clumpy pieces in it. Chicken was okay, not great. Sauce on it tasted burnt.   The marinara sauce on the pasta tasted like regular old Ragu sauce. I legitimately could have made a tastier dish at home and I'm no chef.   We ate about three bites of marinara pasta and half of the chicken. Again clearly we ate only 20% of our meals and she took them away again without asking if anything was wrong.   All this for $67 and we had to go to AJ's after to get dinner because we were hungry and this was terrible.   The atmosphere was okay, but the good and service were horrible. I can't remember the last time I didn't like a restaurant. Will never be back.
