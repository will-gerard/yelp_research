This review is solely based off of the pretentious atmosphere. Hillstone does have some friendly servers and good food but unfortunately the hostess area can be a little entitled. Being in the food industry you should know to be accomdating and if not at least friendly. We had a reservation for 5 and because my family invited me along there was 6. The hostess with a big bun on her head and white pearls said "No we cannot fit 1 more person. That won't work" No sense of respect or an "I'm sorry it doesn't look like we can squeeze a seat in." Etc. Having worked at lower price ticket restaurant when I was 19 I know better that in this type of business you want to be customer service friendly and try to be accomdating. My cousins came in late so there was 6 and I'm sorry but I was going to tell my family member who just moved her to turn around drive an hour back home. He sat down with us in the booth. It wasn't too tight and we were not in anybodys way. Yet even a female manager came over introduced herself with no smile. Explained that these booths are meant for 5 and asked if we are comfortable here in a snooty manner. Then we said yes of course we had an unplanned guest and obviously has a reservation we are fine. But if anything larger is available then that would be amazing. She rolled her eyes and said no and that wanted to make sure... lol if that's your management coming to identity that we are in trouble in a manipulative way, I don't think me, my 85 year old grandma and grandpa and mother and father and cousin are blind to your entitled snobbish personalities that run this place. I would say it's good food but no interest in coming to a place with such low class.

My favorite dry cleaning in the area. I live in Scottsdale but I make the drive back to my fave spot in Arcadia. My family and I both go here and we have never had any problems with our clothing. I tend to do same day pick up anywhere so my clothes aren't piled up with others and get creases being shoved in after days. I picked up my clothes here after 2 days because I forgot about it and they looked phenomenol. Perfectly steamed and they got a stain out of my blouse. Awesome dry cleaning and friendly staff that has been around for some time. Keep up the great job guys.

I have to give this place 5 stars!!! I went today to get my oil changed after work around 430.  I had never been to this location and I left happy.  I pulled up and the young guy working was so helpful and kind.  They took my car and were done in 5-10 minutes.  I literally went inside to pay (20 dollars by the way) cheapest oil change I have paid.  I walked inside to the cashier, where there is a kids playground inside(who knew) The two people working were smiling and seemed to be super happy (even if they were working on a Saturday)  The man gave me a receipt and said now that you have this you can come in next time and get a free car wash and also today you get free popcorn.  I laughed and was surprised by the popcorn machine near the entrance (fresh popcorn).  I left after spending twenty bucks with popcorn, a free car wash and an oil change under 10 minutes.  I will be back :)

I had a blow out on the freeway 3 days ago and went to this Discount and bought two new tires for the 2 that were older to play it safe. Then coincidentally 3 days later my other tire that is was fine blew out. I came back to discount and they applied a few discounts but still had to pay.. but I guess why I can't give it 5 stars is because one of their employees came up to me after the service and said we try to stay away from these caps on tires bc they can come unscrewed and increase the chance of low pressure and increase your chances of a blowout. He then told me that the last time I was there they may have not screwed them on well... okay well I would have appreciated you telling the rest of the staff in front of you so maybe their would be more responsibility on the location. Ugh overall paid 500 dollars for new tires but just would have appreciated more of a break if their is a chance it was their fault

Hiro! My FAVORITE sushi joint in AZ!! The last sushi I had was about two weeks ago in Hawaii so coming back I haven't had the urge to get sushi thinking it just won't be the same. I have always loved this well kept secret and have continued to bring friends who are obsessed! Thank goodness for the X who showed me Hiro. I needed to find a place to get good sushi. I have come here for a few years n have never been disappointed. It's a small restaurant where the sushi chefs don't use gloves because they are so excellent with their knives and watch the handling of everything I trust that this place is not only authentic sushi but very clean. The staff are nice, they have good specials and the food is amazing!!! Please order a calamari for yourself as an appetizer (you won't regret it) :)

My dog got so sick here that I had to immediately take him to another veterinarian. They notified me that the previous place had no concept of health/well being for animals if they sent him home to me like this. He could have died. Don't take in pets for any type of spay, neutering, cleaning of any sort. My dog baby had the saddest look on his face and had a hard time breathing. I wish I did more research before I took him here.

I love Kona Grill!!! Great happy hour and lots of options. You can sit downstairs in the dining area or grab a seat at the sushi bar. The servers are super sweet especially McKenna, Stephanie, Eric and Josh! I'm biased but they are amazing! If you go upstairs (3-7) week days and different hours on weekends, that's where happy hour is served. If you sit at the bar Brett and Russ will keep you company. I recommend almost everything there. Appetizers are great like the avocado egg roll or chicken satay (sub out the slaw) for pineapple pork rice.. Hm the cosmos are sweet.. I could ramble on. If you feel like a sandwich I enjoy the avocado chicken club. If you want a salad you must order the oriental chicken salad!! It's delish!! Lastly, if you are there for dinner the sea bass is fishy but it's a favorite of mine or pork tenderloin. Haha I know this whole menu but overall if you are a first timer at Kona, you will have lots of options. The menu is half sushi and half American based food with a style of Caribbean. I love Kona obviously! :)

Mediocre dry cleaning. I want to like this business..why? 1. I like to support Yelp advertisers 2.prime location!!! It is literally around the corner from me and I will probably still go there once in awhile out of convenience.  Once or twice I called rushing to get there before they closed and they waited a minute over closing time which was very nice of them. However, this review is simply based off of satisfaction with my clothing.  Almost every time I have come there I have to ask to redo my shirts.  It drive me nuts because the employees are nice about it.  When I woke up today and had 50 dollars worth of clothing needed to be dry cleaned I drove 20 minutes to my old favorite cleaners in Arcadia.  I knew that I trust them with my clothes and after years, never had to deal with such an inconvenience.  I'm sorry but had to only give 3 stars. I might be back one more time.. only when I have to.  John I read your message and appreciate that so I updated my review out of appreciation towards your response. I want to come back because it is convenient. Thanks for caring

I will never be back to this place. I have had countless clothing items redone. The worst feeling is when you have to ask for the employees to redo items and then come back for it and they are just as bad. The owner agreed that the quality was very poor on my dresses (wrinkly and creases) I came back and he left a note saying this is the best we can do. Wrinkles and creases in the front and back. I had to go to my parents in Arcadia to use the steamer and get it out. This is one of those places that is convenient because it's close and I have made excuses saying the staff are so friendly and some of my clothes look alright..but after one occasion where a 100 dollar dress was ruined and then so many redone items that look like crap I am so over this place.  Worst review for the worst drying cleaning I have experienced. Sorry I'm not sorry

Best blow dry ever! Michael knows colour, cut, extensions, styling and most importantly does the best blow dry in Scottsdale. I can never make my hair look even close. He will be honest and if you want to do something different with your hair, he will tell you if your type of hair will do that. With over 30 years experience he is not a young kid fresh out of beauty school that hopes for the best. He knows his stuff and obviously is the owner of the salon. Yes, the location is a prime spot in Old Town (right next to Teres) but is just a little cheaper in pricing than other salons. His salon is definitely a nicer business but he keeps it casual where it is not a snobby atmosphere. He does have a big clientele. If you need your hair done within the week he can typically fit you in. Call the business line. He usually is the person who answers and set an appointment. Guarantee if your loyalty is up for grabs then you should go to Michael V Salon and see what you think.

Tolan the manager is always super friendly! I've been going to Carlsbad for years so I am a regular, but that started because the service is friendly and the food is great. This is a very popular joint that's been around because they do what they can to please their customers. I'm surprised with some of the okay reviews (but you can't please everyone) maybe those people were having a bad day. Also a heads up the food is tasty and there are some dishes with some spice/flavor, that you may not think of so I always ask if it's spicy. You should go in this place if you haven't already. Yum!

Has gone down hill so drastically!!! I was a regular here for years when Tolan was a manager. The food was delish and service was always on point. I have maybe skipped by for a year now. I did not recognize more than 1 face ( a younger guy server). My boyfriend and I walked in to ask for dining for 2. There was an older lady as a hostess maybe in her 50s. She said one table left. I kindly asked okay no booths by chance when I saw several open. She repeated herself verbatim but so rudely "One table left."  I look at her confused by her tone. She sat us in the back and our serve has 4 tables from what I saw. She was nothing extraordinary with her customer service. I asked for my usual filet minon quesadilla. She said I think that's only for happy hour. Walked away 10 feet to another server and came back saying yeah we can't do that. Now keep in mind I have been there for years different days a week different times. Happy hour and non happy hour. They have never refused to make it. I ordered tacos and the server rushes us to pick. Food came out & food was bland and so disappointing. I tip over 20 percent and am not super picky. But rude hostess, unwilling staff, awful food. Used to love this place. Never going back. I read all the recent reviews since new owner. Sorry carlsbad but you lost your oldtown rating to me

If you have a cat/kitten and are needing to board them when you leave town Scottsdale Pet Hotel is now my go to. I found this place through Yelp and saw a previous review that they take cats as well. My little guy is named Monkey and he's 6 months old. I adopted him not too long ago and this was the first time I left him somewhere, which was for 5 nights. I called and had no issue scheduling a month in advance and it's very affordable. I asked if I could come in earlier and check out their location which they had no problem with. The cat condos are probably the biggest in size that I have seen. I checked out 2 other spots and this place had the most room for my furbaby. I was missing him on my trip and called the work line, which an employee Sean answered. He was the guy that helped get Monkey situated. I told him feel free to text me any pictures of my kitty.. the next day he sent me pictures and updates and the following as well. Absolutely phenomenal customer service. I loved being able to drop of Monk and feel like he was happy. I'm going to start taking him there for grooming and see how they do. So far very impressed

Amazing food! I always get the pozole. It's so flavorful and even having plenty of mexican dishes in my family Sierras is my fave!! All the food is really tasty & the vibe here is nice too. Even a little eye candy I won't complain. The male servers are quite attractive

I hate to write a bad review for this place after years of going. I love using Yelp to compliment a business but feel that this review is for the business to know what is unacceptable. I met my cousins for lunch and I was first to get there. The hostess Jessica told me she would have to wait to seat me till my group arrived.  I don't mind that policy. I ended up going to the bar while waiting and realized my cousin including her 7 year old daughter sat themselves in a booth. My little cousin is seven so she didn't have the intention to annoy the hostess by picking a table. After a minute the hostess came up and said word for word, "You cannot ever sit yourself. Never ever do that." Then whipped her hair and stormed away like a teenager having a tantrum. I love the food, the service is always great but unfortunately I will not want to go back after my family and I were told off by a kid.  Love you LGO.. I hope your staff is expected to have better manners in the future.

Baby breakfast buzz. That's pretty much my usual order at this point. You will recognize it is a lot of regulars at this point that know the menu and will wait in the line. It is worth it because the food is healthier and catered towards people on the go that don't want fast food..and the menu is also very vegetarian/vegan friendly. I enjoy Dlish and mostly everybody in Scottsdale knows about this place by now and if you don't then you're missing out. Five stars for friendly service and tasty meals.

Love this little family ran Vietnamese joint.  I live farther away but when I travel to north Scottsdale this is typically where I like to make it a point and go. Spring rolls, all the appetizers and soups are delish! You might be a little hesitant at first but once you order and take a bite you will be at ease. Also, if you are taking a first date here I dont suggest it. It is a very casual tiny place and is a cheaper menu so you may come off the wrong way. This place is more for a 2nd or 3rd occasion, when you want to show you know good hidden kept secrets in the area. If you're looking to be in and out stop in there.

This five star review is purely because of my gel manicure with Steven. I attached a pic of what it looked like. He took his time which I not only appreciated but needed. I was tired of going to the same girl at a different location because she was getting too sloppy with the details. I came to AZ Tip and Toes because I get my pedicures here. I looked at previous reviews and somebody said Steven is great with design. I made the appointment and he took his time taking off what my old girl did and shaped, cleaned up and made my nails look beautiful. The detail of his design is perfection. He didn't skip the sides or miss a spot which I would usually notice. Best manicure and I will now start scheduling my manicures with him. Hopefully the salon doesn't make him rush clients because I really needed this time. 5 stars. Amazing!

I've come here often and I am never disappointed. My last visit I decided I must write a review for them because of how sincere this business is. Not only is the food really good and the place is never super busy, so u can get in and out without running into everybody but the staff care about their business. I was minding my business eating my pho and a loud customer placed a to go order. She asked the staff to place the items a certain way because once something was off balanced and came out (prob the customers fault) I say this because she seemed obnoxious. However, I think it was the owner who was helping the customer and after the customer left u could hear the woman telling the kitchen to really focus on packaging to go orders. She even said to the other employee "Do you understand, because this is how we learn and do better" :) I think I just really appreciated a business taking ownership and caring about customer service even when the customer is not around.

Do not give this business your money credit cards. I have ordered from them before and had delivery. The woman said your charge today will be 22 and something change. The delivery guy came and the bill was 27 and change. I called and asked to speak to a manager. Two women said no manager here. I don't care if you want to pretend to not speak English I will not be going to giving my money here ever again. Then I speak to the girl who says she took the order and she said she's telling the truth and that she told me 27 something. Long story short I am calling my bank right now and getting it taken care of. What a crappy establishment! Never trust your money with them.

Writing this review as a former fast pass customer. 1. I am writing this review because I am thinking within the next 24-48 hours something is going to go wrong with my car or my tires are going to go flat.. maybe worse. I had this kid try to direct me on to their conveyor belt like thing. Which I have done 100 times with my car. He did not tell me to turn me wheels in any correct manner so it's turned me car quickly and I rolled down my window to ask a question before he motioned if my car was in neutral. The machine started forcing my car where it felt like something was destruction the bottom. I won't be surprise if something is wrong which in case it'll be back talking to somebody. 2. The guy at the front was nice but tried to get me to join a fast pass membership again. He held me up for a little longer helping some people in the fast pass line when he already had my debit card in hand and charged. 3. He gave me the wrong receipt. 4. I came back around and asked for me correct receipt which did not state they charged me 9.00 and 5. He apologized and then gave me somebody else receipt. 6. I got stuck in the middle of their conveyor with cars stuck as well behind me. Yes I've seen final destination. It was a tad freaky! I know there are bigger issues in life then this bad experience with Clean Freak today but this review is incase something is screwed up with my car. Then I will be back

I have been wanting to write a review for Beautifeye for some time now. This is the only place I go for my brows. I have been over waxing since I started coming here two years ago. Threading makes my brows look cleaner more natural and lasts longer than waxing. I'm obsessed and I don't know what I would do if they were not around. The staff are probably the nicest people and you get a small discount for checking in in Yelp. I recommend this place to anyone and everyone!!

It's about time I update my last five star review. I have gone to Beautifeye for over 5 years for my threading. The staff is always kind and professional. The owners run their business smoothly and top knotch. I pretty much always get right in as a walk in. But I do always come at easier times. The most I have waited is 20 minutes when it was a peak time and lots of people were ahead of me. Sri threads my brows and she is phenomenol. Threading with her is easy and not painful. She knows I love some tweezing too and provides me with some aloe after. I trust her with always keeping my shape clean and still full. Also, she does some awesome henna tattoos in the location every first Saturday of the month  I think it's by appointment but she did my foot and wrist one time freestyle. She's great!! Tori is also amazing at threading and when she tints my brows I love that the color is not too dark but just right. I love Beautifeye. Mercie, Tori & Sri are awesome!! I'll probably be bringing my future daughter here for her brows when she's older ha. But yes this is my favorite go to spot for my brows.. Beau is awesome too if you catch him working the front desk. This place deserved my five star rating. Loveee!

I want to be able to give 5 stars!! I have gotten my hair blown out here maybe 8 times now. Every time I come the blow outs are mostly great! The front desk is typically friendly.. I do have to ask for a beverage most times. Since I believe the policy is to offer I wish they would be a little more prompt. I enjoy the products here because they smell yummy. I think every single blowout I have had was done well. The technique they use for the blow out called "Mai tai" is great with my layers. I love the look. The last visit I had yesterday was my favorite blow out. But I have noticed that every time I have gotten my hair washed there the girls half-ass the shampooing. Not one of the staff has thoroughly scratched and rubbed underneath my head when I'm tilted in their sink. It's annoying for dryness after. I have even mentioned it and they say oh that's crazy and still avoid doing it. It's a little crazy that they are a dry bar yet suck at washing and shampooing effectively. Other than that I really like this place. They always get me in quickly and have had luck with walk ins as well. I can only give them 4 stars bc of this and lastly because yesterday the front desk were two blonde girls I have never seen that were on their cell phones which seemed unprofessional and I couldn't help but keep staring at this girl with the shortest shorts who worked the front. It kind of made me look at drybar as less professional. Ah I wish I could give it 5

Brenna is hands down the BEST girl you will want to see if you are getting a spray tan in Scottsdale. I started going to Brenna quite some time ago.  After seeing what some of my girlfriends look like after going elsewhere in the area it reassures me that I am lucky to have found this spot. Brenna is upstairs and if you want to use the side entrance it is easier to get in and out without being seen bra-less afterwards.  If you go in for the first time she will welcome you with a friendly smile and make you as comfortable as possible.  Brenna is professional, kind and fun to talk to while getting sprayed.  She matches your skin tone to what she knows will look like a good match so you dont walk away looking like the typical Scottsdale girl with blotchy skin and some old bottle of jergens that went bad (I dont actually know if Jergens can go bad) but you get the point. I love that I found this spot and have referred Brenna to others who love her too. Best spray tan in the Dale!!

Can honestly say one of the biggest jokes. Is this a real restaurant?? My boyfriend and I were planning on going to the aquarium so decided to grab a bite to eat before our day started. We were seated and at first the big shark tank visible was appealing. We sat by the tank which was neat. Our server looked 15 and was sweet. She took our order and I ordered the bbq sandwich. Worst bbq meat I've ever had, could barely chew it. The bottom of the bun was soggy and fell apart. My boyfriend had to use a fork and knife with his sandwich too bc the same thing. My side dish of mac and cheese was rigatoni.. weirdest flavoring on top. I am not that picky but if you mess up mac and cheese wtf. It was gross!!! We both looked at each other and agreed that this was possibly the worst experience in a restaurant and gross food. Not to mention our food came out 4 minutes after ordering. Haha we should have taken that as a sign. If that's not bad enough during our meal I started looking around. I realized the servers all were young girls that looked 15. I felt uncomfortable for them like it wasn't legal I kid you not. I have to complain about the music. There was children in this place around the age of 5 primarily with families. The entire time we dined here they played early 2000 music with punk bands.. mostly taking back sunday loudly. I didn't see any adults running this place so it kind of explains it. We walked out laughing and questioning if we just ate at a real restaurant. Literally insane and really nasty. I can't help but laugh after this experience. My head is still spinning

17 minutes for a cold sandwich.  People who ordered after me got theirs first and no apology for it taking so long just left a bad taste in my mouth. The employee looked at me like it had not been almost 20 minutes for a to go sandwich

I wanted to update my review to a 1 star after trying once again to order lunch here. Now I can not only say the food takes way too long but some of the employees are incredibly rude. A young tall guy maybe around the age of 20 acted unprofessional and absolutely rude that I just can't go back. This place obviously gets business because of the people working in the offices. If it weren't for them I don't see how this place would stay in business

I have been meaning to write this review for awhile.  Luis was recommended through a coworker of mine. Before ever stopping in another mechanic was trying to charge me over a 1k to a new Nissan mount. I then went to Luis and he charged me barely over a 100 and he also through in a new belt which I needed. I have come back to him and he really is so nice ethical and they have a great business here. I would recommend these guys to anybody.

MIC! This is my first review I am writing on Yelp and I am so happy I can proclaim my obsession with the Madison. When you walk in you're greeted by the nicest staff. The cafe has healthy small plates and protein shakes that you can preorder before your class and get a discount.  If you enjoy spin classes or yoga you will love this studio. The yoga classes are all a little on the intermediate level but if you are newer to yoga the instructors are helpful no matter how large the class. I did study yoga for a year in college and the classes definitely push me.  But obviously the point of a good work out is to sweat and feel accomplished after.  The spin classes are insane but in the best way.  You are in a dark room with loud pump up music and the flashing lights(club scene) The teachers are getting you to feel good and keep you going the whole class.  No matter what class you take at MIC you will leave feeling like you had a great workout.

I love Drybar! I primarily go to the Phoenix location. The girls are great & the blow drys are so convenient for me. I have gone to a lot of the girls over the past year but mostly go to Michelle & Hailey. I love how their blowouts last me a long time & I will continue to go Drybar for my future blowouts :)

Updated from 3 to 2 stars. This review used to be 3 because the food is great and shakes are great but the customer service isn't the greatest. After my last experience being so negative this time the service was mediocre except it took 30 minutes to get a salad when I reminded them about it their solution was to give me multiple salads... I would have preferred to come back. But okay I guess between lack of service two trips ago and this last time I gave you my money I experience lackadaisical  staff that I don't know if I feel the need to go back.. too bad bc the food is good

Amazing! When is this spot going to appear on food network?! Imagine an old drive through fast food restaurant that was redone in the most fashionable way. It is a mix between a five guys/modern diner with a great vibe inside with amazing staff!! The food omg!! It's a small menu of tacos and burgers! Maybe 5 items on the menu but you can't go wrong with anything. Personally if you haven't bee to this spot order a standard burger with cheese, fries and when they ask you if you want a side of ketchup and stand sauce.. ask for both! Amaaazing!!!

I came here after searching for a clean, affordable tanning spot. The staff are welcoming and the location is convenient for me. I love how inside the rooms you have lots of options for lotions etc that they provide you with. You also get a cold towel to help out with the heat. I really like this spot, they are pretty decent pricing and I feel it's very clean and we'll kept

My boyfriend and I are both sick in bed. We ordered through postmates. It is a delivery service that picks up from Chop Shop and comes to homes. We did not receive all of our order so the delivery left and we only have this location to call and they basically said it's all postmates fault so you can get in touch with them. We don't have a contact phone number for that service but I'm sure Chopped Shop does since they partner with them. Thanks for the above and beyond customer service. The food wasn't even that good

I'm sitting here in the location as I write this review. I am inside walking into a line. I stand there and all of a sudden a girl working behind the counter comes out and walks in front of me in the line and rings herself up an item. She then continues to go sit down in the Starbucks with friends and all of the coworkers behind the counter are all gossiping and venting about their lives. Okay? Well you guys can hate your job and complain but when you're in your physical business that you work in and you look like you're all xanaxed out I will still write this review because you can walk in front of a customer and order something so rudely that it shows your immaturity and lack of respect for the job. Don't care for this place that much but supposedly the employees name is Marisol. Horrible. No wonder these other poor reviews say their drinks are always incorrect and the staff is so slow. Walk inside and you'll see the work effort into making drinks

Walked in thinking I was at the old Darque Tan in the same location but they still have me on file even though it's a completely different business that bought it out so I walk in the staff seemed nice but looked at pricing and couldn't justify in my mind spending $30 on a drop-in when I pay that for an individualized spray tan that 5 times darker. I looked at all the reviews before saying I will think about it and walked out looking on reviews at Sunchain tan  which I'm heading to now for $10 less for a drop in for the highest bed. I still can't believe what a rip-off that is

Good bowling alley but we played 6 games and they charged us for 8 games...80 dollars later and a confusion & disappointed. Not going back for a staff that lies...?
