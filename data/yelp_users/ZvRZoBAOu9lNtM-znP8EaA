Went thru the drive-thru. placed my order, it was repeated back to me correctly, and told the amount. Pulled forward and paid the amount asked for, and waited for my order. Received my order bagged up, and drove off. Got home and found they had only given me 1/3 of my order. Called and asked to speak to the manager, and was told they were too busy and would call me back. Only to find out the manager wasn't even there at 4PM. Was told I could get in my car and drive the 3 miles back to the store and get the rest of my order. They said they would give me some store coupons, which they give out anyway, for the inconvenience. So I could spend more money with them and give them another opportunity to screw-up another order. I now understand why there was no other customers there.

Went there tonight, Monday night. Ordered 3 orders of rolled tacos which are $1.19 for an order of three on Mondays. Asked for guacamole on them expecting to pay extra. When I got to the window, they had charged me $1.49 per order for the guacamole. Last Monday it was $.60 an order which is what the difference on the posted menu is. I asked the guy about it, but got nothing. So let them keep there tacos, and I will not spend anymore money with them.

They are as good as it gets. If you need something BBQ related and they don't have it, in most cases they'll get it. They have created a network of people with experience in just about all forms of BBQ to help you along your way. If there's an BBQ event going on in the Phoenix area, they are either sponsoring, supporting, or competing in it. As we support them, they are supporting us.

Stopped there at approx. 6:45PM. Walked in and was the only customer there. The girl behind the counter went to the back as I walked through the door. She did not come back to the counter for four to five minutes. She had an attitude of she could care less if she waited on me. I asked if they had blueberry or cherry fritters, and she said only apple. I said OK I'd take 4. Her answer was we only have three, and that was that. No offer of something else. Felt as if she was doing me a favor just being there. Hopefully they have a better staff for the morning traffic. But for me, I won't return to the store. Took my money and spent it at Fry's. And surprise, surprise, their fritters were good and less expensive.

This place is LEGIT. They have nailed true Texas BBQ. Scott has mastered his pits, no set it and forget it here, and he has conquered the simplicity of BBQ. It's not about a fancy building or upscale menu, It's about doing BBQ, and BBQ only. He doesn't hold his food all day to be able and serve dinner. He makes an amount to allow him to sell it out before it sets too long. He makes his own sausage in-house. His food stands on equal ground with Franklin's and LA BBQ in Austin. And I don't think I'm too far off with my review judging from the line that is always present. I also know they are not serving commodity beef. I get my briskets from the same wholesaler, and have had to wait a day because Scott has bought them out.

been a customer of the Tempe store for years. They opened this store and are continuing with the great service and selection I have become use to at their other store.  Well worth your time to check them out.
