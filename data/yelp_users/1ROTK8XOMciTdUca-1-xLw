This place has good vibes all around.   I discovered them through Groupon, and because they're right down the street from me. The restaurant is tucked into the corner of a shopping plaza on Camelback & 20th St, right next to Fry's.   There are a few different options for dining here. You can order at the counter for a grab and go option. I saw quite a few people come in an pick up orders that they called in. They also offer delivery. Of course there's a dine in option as well. They have a small bar where you can sit, as well as indoor and patio seating too. After coming here twice, I've had an overwhelming feeling that the tables inside are in desperate need of reorganization. It feels a bit too spread out in there.   The service has been good on both occasions that I have gone. Everyone who works in the restaurant seems to be very friendly and welcoming. I've only been on weekdays and both times I think the bartender was also serving as a waitress which made things a bit held up when the restaurant unexpectedly filled up around 8 PM on a Monday night, but the staff handled it well and did their best to make sure everyone was taken care of.  They have a decent draft list of beers, about 5 options, with one of them being an NYPD custom beer. Some happy hour specials too which included discounted beers and pitchers.   As for the food - I have tried a few different things. The garlic knots, bruschetta pizza, bruschetta appetizer, and penne ala vodka with sausage and peppers. All of it was very good. The portions on the pasta are BIG! Not that I'm complaining, I love leftovers. I want to try the dessert because they look incredible and they seem to have a variety of options.  I'm so happy to have a great pizza place like this nearby and I plan to return in the future.

I can only speak for the take-out service, since I haven't dined in (yet.) Friendly and easy to understand on the phone, food was ready very fast and came out HOT! I appreciated that they serve up the take out orders in a box as opposed to a bag. Why haven't more places thought of this?  I had the vegetable moo shu and it was fantastic. The vegetables weren't oily, just well seasoned and cooked perfectly.   My boyfriend had the general tso chicken and said it was maybe the best he's ever had. It wasn't overly breaded like many are and, I quote, "You can tell there's actually chicken in there."   Apparently they have a good happy hour which I plan to check out. $5 scorpion bowls? I'm in.

I recently hiked the Mormon Loop Trail at South Mountain and it is my favorite that I have hiked so far in Phoenix and Scottsdale.   If you enjoy hiking around here but don't always want the physical challenge of trails like Squaw or Camelback (those are challenging to me) then you'll like this one a lot too. Don't get me wrong, you get a good workout considering the trail is about 6 miles round trip, but only the first mile is really a climb and it's not too bad. You start getting great views of the city almost immediately and there are several places you can stop and get a better look. After that first mile the trail levels out and you get a few more ups and downs throughout the remainder of the trail.   I really appreciated that this trail wasn't very crowded and is dog friendly. The parking lot was full when we got to the trailhead but we only had to wait a few minutes for someone to leave so we could get a spot.   Access to this trail is at the south end of 24th St. if you want to try it too!

A really solid dive bar. It's dark and cool. The door stays open to let in some air. The patrons are diverse (like, some own homes and some own..shopping carts.) The bartenders were very laid back and friendly. Prices for drinks and beer are pretty much un-beatable, and it is CASH ONLY!

This was a nice movie theatre, very clean and well kept. There were no frills, like some of the theaters have these days, but sometimes thats just what you want. I went for a matinee, which was $7.50, so not a bad deal. The seats are average size and comfortable. Stadium seating in the theater and good sound and picture quality. The temperature was comfortable but not too cool.   It's also right near a Walmart and Target so if you're not into paying an arm and a leg for snacks and a drink, you can swing by there before the show and make your girlfriend sneak it in her purse!

I want to start this out by saying that this was my first time at DeFalcos and I will definitely be going back. So that's always a good sign.  I got there right before the lunch rush so I didn't have to wait at all to order. I ordered the Italian sausage hot sandwich with peppers and onions and my boyfriend got the steak and cheese hot sandwich.  We ordered to-go so we had some time to poke around in the grocery part of the store while waiting for our order. Mostly the wines and olive oils which looked like a good selection.  It took about 10 minutes for the order to be ready. It seemed like a lot of people call in their orders ahead of time (note to self.)   The sandwiches were pretty amazing. I'm actually not usually the biggest fan of sausage but since this place is known for it I wanted to try it. If this is what sausages are meant to taste like I feel like I've been missing out my whole life. It was impossibly moist and flavorful. It didn't taste too "sausage-y". I don't know if that will make sense to anyone else, but the "sausage-y-ness" is what I dislike about most sausages. It was topped with their red sauce which was wonderful and the Italian sub roll was perfect.  I'll be back for pizza and desserts.

Stopped in for a drink on a Friday afternoon, unfortunately I wasn't a big fan. There was a faint mildew smell coming from behind the bar, so the cleanliness needs some work. Bartenders were not very friendly. The overall layout of the place seemed a little odd, uninviting and not the kind of place that I'd like to spend time. I wanted to like it, but just couldn't.

I had a first time experience at the bar at Carly's the other day and I was a fan of the place. Small and cozy is how I would describe the atmosphere, with a bit of hipster vibe thrown in there. A small staff of 2 was working the bar and the tables. They don't have too many tables to offer so this made sense. Both of the employees were personable and friendly and they set a good tone for the experience.   They offered a good variety of interesting beers and wine and they had a full bar. House liquor was only $4. I had a wine special which was $6 and the price of the beers varied.   I would be interested in coming back to try their food, since a lot of the sandwiches sounded appealing to me and I enjoyed the experience.

They have good happy hour specials from 3-6. $2 off of domestic pints and a "yard" 32 oz beer for $9. I think there were a couple other specials for wine and well drinks too. Amazing selection of draft beers here. The service was attentive. There are also happy hour specials on food. I tried the tofu lettuce wraps and they were amazing. They even offered to bring out more lettuce cups when I was on my last one but still had more tofu, which I really appreciated.

Really dark and literally a "shady" place, but I liked it a lot. It seemed like a real regulars a place which I take to be a good thing.   I went on a weekday afternoon during happy hour and there was a good little crowd. The bartender was very friendly and down to earth.   Their cocktail list looked awesome, but the well drinks were on happy hour for $3 so I opted for that because I was feeling cheap. (Hey, at least I admit it.) I think their other happy hour special was $.50 off of draft beers.   My overwhelming thought about this place was that it would be a great closing time bar on the weekends. We shall see. I'll be back

This wasn't a bad dog park. I took my dog there at a time that I knew would not be busy since it was a week day in the middle of the day and it was pretty hot, so we only met 2 other dogs while we were there, but they were both friendly. It's a big dog park with lots of space to run around and spread out. Like most dog parks, there's not a lot of shade, but there are a couple of bench areas. Unfortunately I ended up stepping in another dog's poop so I can attest to some people visiting this park and not cleaning up after their dogs, but you'll get that anywhere.  We'll be back to this park.

First and foremost, let me justify why this is 4 stars and not 5. It is certainly not because of the food, service, or cleanliness. It's because of the amount of seating available. I totally get that there is probably a standard size that In n out aims for and there's reasons that I don't understand for the amount of seating available, but c'mon In N Out! People love you!! You get super crowded and anytime around lunch there's pretty much nowhere to sit!  If you're just getting your burgers to-go or you're doing the drive thru then don't worry about it. The service is always super fast and friendly. The burgers and fries are great and not sloppily put together (like I've had at other locations).   I probably shouldn't hold the seating thing against them, but this location has been here for a while so it's time for a patio expansion (at least).

This is a great dog park. There's lots of room and a few separate areas depending on your dogs temperament and what they want to do. The pond is great but it was pretty dirty which made me a little nervous because my dog will drink just about anything. My only gripe is that there is not much shade available, especially during the day, and I wish there was an area for the dogs to drink from other than a hose, like the water fountain at Hance park. Overall, we had a really great time here and my dog really enjoyed it.

This was a great hiking trail and is quite a bit different than most of the trails you find in the area. There are a few up hills and subsequently down hills and there is a lot of loose rock on the trail which can make it a little tricky at times. By loose rock, I mean the trail is completely covered in small loose rocks during some parts.   It's a dog friendly trail, and I didn't notice any issues with people not cleaning up after their pups. Everyone we passed by on the hike was friendly too. There is enough room on most parts of this trail that you can pass people if you're moving at a faster pace.  I liked the views from this trail too. You get to enjoy very different views on the way up and back, and I imagine it would be beautiful at sunrise or set.

I'm a big fan so far. A bit hectic on a Friday night, we just stopped in for a drink and casual meal, so we opted not to wait for an hour - hour and a half for a table and just hit up the bar instead. The bar gets really crowded but the service was still attentive and friendly.   The macadamia and vanilla beer was absolutely incredible. We also had the hummus appetizer which was average but good, and I had the veggie burger which was delicious.   The parking was a little chaotic but I believe they had complimentary valet. We just parked in front of the dry cleaner next door which worked too.  I've heard their brunch is great, so I will definitely be back, and I recommend you check it out.

I could not have had a better experience here, it was exactly what I was looking for! I stopped in with my boyfriend and a friend on a Friday afternoon around happy hour time and we were looking to have a good dinner in a fun environment before heading into the old town bars for the night.  We were able to grab seats at the bar even though the restaurant was almost full. We were served by a couple of really friendly and helpful bartenders. They explained the happy hour specials and helped us pick out some good beers.  What a great beer selection, and I loved the mugs they served the beer in. It was just fun to drink out of.  The whole place was boisterous and had a really fun and happy vibe. We ordered an appetizer which I think was chips with some kind of cheese and nacho type topping. Whatever it was it was delicious!   I ordered the veggie burger as my meal and I'm SO glad I did! Holy cow their veggie burger is incredible. The bartender told me she recommends it to people regardless of whether or not they are vegetarians because it's so good.  On the menu, it says that if you like the food you can add a beer to your tab for the kitchen staff when they are done with their shift. What a great idea! I bet they're drunk every night because the food was incredible. I can't wait to go back.

I really like Hance Dog Park. It's about as far from me as Steele Indian Park is, and I much prefer this one. It's maintained well, and they  usually close the park if there's much rain to preserve it. I like that there is a good amount of seating around the dog park, and there are bags and trash cans all around the perimeter as well. No excuse not to clean up after your pup! I've never encountered an aggressive dog here either. There's always a good mix of dogs here that play well.   Bonus: if you come in the evening you get a decent view of the sunset and Phoenix skyline.

Way overpriced for what you get. I literally did not know that tacos could be made as small as they make them here. And a $5 taco at that. Sheesh.   Head down to 16th st and get some real tacos for 20% of the cost

I went here on a Friday for a drink with some friends and was pleasantly surprised by the place. It was busy and full of people enjoying themselves. I love the concept of the specializing in both beer and coffee, the best of both worlds. I wasn't in the mood for either of those on the night that I went, but I did appreciate their beer selection and was happy with the Joel Gott Sauv Blanc instead.   I didn't expect the live music that was performing, but I did enjoy it. Although a bit loud, considering the acoustics of this place (think: gutted auto repair shop with metal and wood tables) I can still appreciate some live acoustic covers. Make sure to dress semi-warmly if you go at night during this time of year, since it is pretty much completely open.  Bonus: I think we were the only people that realized that there are 2 parking spots right in front of Sip (the lot in the back was full).
