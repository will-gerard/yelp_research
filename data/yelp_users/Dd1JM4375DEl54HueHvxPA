Wow I know this is a smaller research active doctors office, but if other offices ran there business the way these people do I would come to doctors more often.  I have been here multiple times with fellow employee to have blood drawn and we walk in every time. No wait no hassle and every doctor greets you with joy. They are the nicest staff and give you snacks as well after your visit.  To me when I'm already going through the pain of visits to doctors all I ask when I'm getting bent over ( money wise) is that I don't feel like cattle on a assembly line and I don't wait 4 hours to see a doctor I'm paying out of the ass for!   Good job Pulmonary Associates !

OMG , I got brought here for lunch since we were in the "hood" which it is lol. We pulled up and I didn't even notice it was a restaurant. It is a old house converted into a Mexican restaurant with no sign out front.   We got there at 12:30 pm with 9 people already in line, while there for 5 min another 20+ people showed up! The old small house only hold at most 15 people so its a little crammed but knowing your gonna get delicious food you close your eyes and imagine eating :)  They do have only a basic menu and DO charge for everything from salsa to sour cream. Also no drink fountain. Its like buying Mexican food from mexico and a taco shop, only cans and bottles of soda/water..   After waiting 20 min to order and get my food we sat down at there outside eating areas and chowed in. DELICIOUS ( see picture) my red chili burro enchilada style was covered in hot melted cheese and red sauce. It was extremely fresh and flavors were on point. It was a 5/5 stars for me.   I would recommend this place to anyone in the area , but be warned 1) Get there early to beat the rush 2) During summer you might wanna eat in your car or get to go ! Due to outside seating having no shades  3) The best option out of them all ENJOY!!

Smelly Durian , fresh frogs and weird seafood, and S*** I cannot pronounce. Yup I'm at the Chinese Cultural center food market :) This place offers everything asain. From food to furniture.   I love coming here and wondering down the aisles looking for cool stuff and food I would dare to try. This place also has many of restaurants in the surrounding area so dine in on some non-amaricanized Chinese food.  Also for a plus come on the weekends in the morning and catch them making sweet Chinese mini pancakes out front for 1$ a piece. There delicious and made on some weird special pan.  Located right off the 202 freeway this is a must see. They have plenty of statues , stores and history to take in.

You needs keys done : Hicks is the answer.  Been around forever and they have a no nonsense approach to any question you have about safes, locks or keys .   Guys are straight forward and honest. No up sells or pressure.

If you want a lounge to people watch or to get some hand made cocktails and pick up women in a lowlight bar, this place is your spot. The bar you can miss with the blink of a eye since the entrance is practically just a door.  Dress nice for its more upscale, bring your wallet also since the drinks are handmade with the finest alcohol. I tried ordering a Coors and the waitress sorta laughed at me and recommended a drink I have never heard of, with a alcohol I have never heard of.   The atmosphere is almost pitch black in there, they have candles going and a couple of very low beam lights at the tables making it a perfect bar for small talk while you sip on your 20 year old scotch,  " righty o chap "! Don't expect club music and twerking.  I don't think I will return to this establishment for me having a drink is actually a social event, this bar is nice but when I spend $15 dollars on a drink I want to fully inhibit my attitude and I feel like I'll get thrown out if I go above a decibal range .5...

Get here Early cause this whole parking lot is nothing but food so its practically impossible to find a space.   Unless you park illegally at Walgreens where a sign clearly says violaters will be towed.   I dont get why people hate on Pei Wei its delicious food really fast . You can actually see the people make your food so its not like other chinese resteraunts where you just assume there preparing it fresh.

I attended mass and school here for all my k-8. We attended every thursday at 8 o'clock every week. The priests here are amazing and always lending an ear if you need to talk or get some help with problems. The church itself is a little old but very well kept up and beautiful inside ! There is a huge middle section that holds a couple hundred people and both side sections of pews that hold another 50+ both sides .   The church also hold english and  Spanish mass's ( probably spelt that wrong haha ) if you have not checked out the school next door I would deff go see what they have to offer . They have great teachers, programs , and curriculum..  Also the school has recently been renovated by Mr . Brennan the principal / baseball couch that got alot of vendors to donate money or supplies to the baseball field and basketball fields.   Check it out!

Just like Razzmatazz that went out of business this local store is a hidden gem. The employees are very nice and helpful and the store has unique designs and furniture for every mood.   Who ever decorated the store deserves a A+ because they made the layout extremely fun and it actually makes you want to look at everything and maybe purchase ;)   Come support local business and check this place out!

Clean resteraunt chain that still puzzles me how they stay in business . But tryed there grilled chicken tacos for the first time and they were acually pretty good .   What bothered me is they have signs out for taco Tuesday for .39 cent tacos but they said its only from 3-11 pm . Its TACO TUESDAY not taco 3-11pm ...   But of you want cheap fast imitation mexican food its pretty good

I hate Shell, and especially Danny's . After the scandal they went through of rehiring Illegals knowingly for cheap labor they have lost my business.   They always have overpriced gas and small inventory compared to QT. And to be honest Danny's is hot or miss on there car detailing when I used to go to them back in the day.  (Only reason I'm here now is emergency gas , didn't notice on way to work how low I was on gas and no QT near by.) And there getting 2 stars for this location cause in the nicer areas of Scottsdale shell does make there Gas stations look good!

Here is a Circle K I usually right about. On a crappy dirt filled lot with trash everywhere. There are homeless everywhere asking for change or sitting in the corner. The store is old small and disgusting inside. The employees are slow and don't care.   There are only 4 pumps here and in a SMALL parking lot so good luck trying to maneuver around when its busy.   All around this is how 80% of Circle Ks are and why if I can help it I do not stop here.

A quaint little suites hotel located off the freeway and next to a vast majority of all chain resteraunts and business'. There is a Shell gas station right next door (over priced gas ) but for convenience is pretty good.   There is also a Hospital right next door , hopefully on your visit that wont be needed lol.   The staff here is really friendly  The breakfast is just cereals , muffins etc could use some improvement but nothing to complain about .  And the grounds are well kept and clean.

Like the old Blockbusters this place revives the old charm yet hard work I obviously forgot that came with walking each aisle of the endless movies of time.   Redbox and Netflix changed the way the world views movies and I give them credit since I am hooked to Netflix. But with only few selections they have , I crave more!   I think there needs to be one of these stores in every city, not only because of there massive stock of movies, but also so we can get up off our lazy asses and experience society.   I will frequent Superstar Video from now. I walked in the store for 5 min and found 3 movies I wanted to see for awhile :)  Blue ray = $1.40 for 1 night DVD = $1.40 for 4 nights  Good prices and very friendly staff

Game day baby! Good local chain that has cheapish drinks and a pretty decent menu that has a diverse menu for any pallet. The waitress we had was on point and the resteraunt was clean. Pretty standard chain.  Would reccommend if your just in a "lets go out" mood .  I had 2 different managers and shift supervisors come up to me and ask if food was ok and if they could get me anything.! Customer service was outstanding today.

I walked over from gym in want of healthy chicken and rice and upon entering i was the only customer. The two employees were sitting down on their phones while there was trash on the table and customers wanting food!   Upon getting my food for what I thought was gonna be a standard teriyaki chicken bowl , was a al le cart huge bin of chicken , then a huge been of rice . I thought wow im gonna have some left over. I began to eat and the chicken was full of gristle so long story short threw it away ..   Not impressed

Free breakfast with alcohol purchase on weekends and you get a lot! On a good hangover day come to Jimbos and relieve the pain and discomfort.  5 dollar drafts (Huge) and you get hash browns , eggs, bacon, sausage, and toast... Enough said! I'm a happy customer.  They don't skimp on the breakfast either, its unlimited and you can keep asking for more. The waitress' will accommodate for they are surprisingly pleasant when it is PACKED on Sunday morning.   They also have many TVs on the wall for those Sunday morning games .

I came in at 5:11 before the dinner rush so this review probably won't go along with the other 8 negative reviews about this place.  There were no customers when we came in and were going to Cali in the AM so we decided to pre pack cold subs for the trip. Heidi the "sandwich specialist" took care of us and even greeted us when we walked in. She was very nice and took care of our picky order..  All in all its a Subway, I guess the right time to come to this one is not during a rush for they seem to be rude and condescending..

The place was slow for 3 pm which I figured .. But usually Chipotle is always fast and im out the door in 3 min even with 20 people in line ...   This time we had 1 couple in front of us and me and my girlfriend amd we were there for like 12 min!!!!   Besides the slow service which is probably due to short staff , the food was excellent and fresh!!!

Always a delight having one of these by your house. If ya don't wanna deal with the 100,000 acres of Home Depot.   Ace is a little over priced but always convenient and has specialty items the big retails don't! Check out there weekly sales in there ads they send out!   Usually the clerks or sales assistants know where everything is and what aisle off the top of there head.

Went in to get door speakers in my first new car .. 2012 chevy cruze . I spent at least 2 hours in here asking about different options and pricing with the guy up front ... After hearing "the exact door speakers I wanted on demo with a amp " The guy promised me my car would sound just as great but after they installed them and 852$ later ( Just for door speakers and a small amp ) did not sound nearly as good as store demo ... I mean he picked them out for me saying this  is what he would get and they installed them , But it feels like a major bait and switch ... My moms fiance just got regular 99$ a Pair kickers had 4 in all doors and had a amp with his system tied in and his sound better then my 400$ dollar speakers with a amp set aside just for my speakers ...   Just know everything about what your doing before you get a price here ...

What can make a Walmart already worse then it is?!  Answer : Bell road !   Located at just the corner where hell breaks loose on the streets of Arizona. Whether during the madness of Christmas shopping or normal day rush hour this Walmart proves to be the mecca of horrible parking and clutter.     Also see my other favorite site : peopleofwalmart.com  Proves that MOST people who shop here belong in a traveling circus for people to laugh at through cages while eating popcorn.

I LOVE this Petsmart! The location can be a pain in the ass during holiday seasons but to me it's worth it.  The employees here are so nice when we bring or Maple in. They greet us and play with our puppy. They also recommend puppy food and all the stuff she would need.  The store is surprisingly clean for an place where dogs meet and do there business on accident all over the floor.   They are a little overpriced but have SO MUCH inventory from cheap food to all organic expensive nutrient rich food. Check out the specials on dog toys cause for 30 bucks we got a lot of cool toys .  I will update this review after we take Maple in for puppy training !

Harkins on 83rd has yo be one of my favorite Harkins around. There staff is always nice and and they have all movies and a lot of Showtime's.  Also one big thing for me is they have more then 1 person working concession! I hate when you arrive to your movie and you wanna see the previews and you go to get a soda and there is 20 people waiting and 1 person working..   Also if your a movie fanatic, go buy the shirt and cups for 2015. A big money saver if you frequent the movie theater! You will spend 25 just for the items but will save you mad money in the long hall.

Food is absolutely delishish! We got there at 4:01 pm right when they opened and wow was I amazed on how many people were waiting in line to eat rich at 4pm.   By 4:15 there were over 15 tables seated. This was my firat visit here since high school so it was almost like a new experience for me again :)   Upon sitting they gave us warm buttery fresh rolls with a delishish cinnamon butter mhmmmm :)  We got the 12 oz Ribeye with steak frys and butter corn which was around 16.99. The Ribeye was medium rare and Soooo tender you could cut it with a fork   We also got a full slab of Fall of the Bone ribs and let me tell you they were Fall of the Bone!! You could not even pick up the ribs without the meat falling off. The flavor was excellent too!   Over all a little expensive date but way worth the money!

I happened to get $50 in gift certificates at a lucky christmas party for the company this year so we decided to go on sat at 530 pm. It was very packed but we were seated promptly as we wanted to sit outside cause the weather was so nice!   Our server was very knowledgeable pf the whole menu which in my opinion seems impossible lol. He was very patient and was great at refilling our drinks and getting us whatever we wanted.   As the food goes it was pretty expensive but overall worth the price. We ordered the following   1) pretzel crusted chicken . A little sampler that was very moist and delicious and came with sauces to dip in YUM  2) Deep fried cheese . Little triangles of deep fried mozzarella . They didnt skimp on the cheese inside :)  3) Loaded bake potato soup. Enough said lol  4) Dynamite shrimp . This one I didnt care for it was small shrimp with breading and a "spicy" sauce which wasn't spicy at all and tasted like chipotle sauce  5) spicy chicken chipotle pasta. Which again wasn't spicy but was good. Not Great. It sounded better on the description on menu.

Wow zero stars.. Again same story we had a gift card from Christmas and decided to try it before we saw a movie at Harkins.   We popped in at 330 pm and were seated immediately by our server. She was really nice and took good care of us. This review is on the food and alcohol.   I ordered a $5 Carona draft and it came out in this huge 10 pound glass and was Luke warm! NOT GOOD  I then decided to order a "hand shaken" 1800 margarita. ($9.50) after drinking half I had to flag down waitress and ask if there was any alcohol  in here ! 2nd mistake! She then brings me back another one on the house and it was soooo strong.  Besides alcohol I ordered a #1 enchilada special and rice,beans, and 2 flavors of different enchiladas and wow it was the grossest Mexican food I have ever had. No flavor at all  Again also a #2 same thing 2 different flavors of enchiladas and again no flavor and very bland.  And for the final straw... They brought us 3 different flavors of salsa before our meal ( sry at the end of review) THE WORST SALSA EVER TASTED!!!! 1 Red salsa tasted like straight BBQ sauce, another red was straight water, and the green was really sweet..  Overall never again..

In the industrial part of town so a little old of a neighborhood but not to bad. The intersection trying to get into this QT is the worse in AZ . The light going west off the freeway is a no left , so you have to go about a mile and do a u-turn due to the LONG traffic line trying to get onto the freeway !

This will be a 3.5 star review. A really old Carl's Jr/Green burritos building that has been converted into a Mexican paradise theme. The building in not that big but hosts ALOT of small tables and chairs for this place gets popping on weekends due to live music.   The staff here is excellent it seems to be the same group working every time I have came here so you know consistansy with food recipes and service will always be good. 5/5   Atmosphere is pretty cool here, they have a bar up front and a small bar in back  for the weekends. The beach motique actually works here. They also have a medium size patio with misters for a pleasant smoke and drink 4/5  Food is where it gets great! I have had multiple things here over the years and haven't been disappointed. The red chili burrito is huge and delicious! I'm 6'5 230 pounds and the burrito is like my hand + some!! Also have great breakfast burritos and green chili..   Come on weekends for live music and festive drinking for every weekend is Cinco De Mayo at Mixteca ...

Wow I never knew I was passing this up every time someone offered to come here. I have ALWAYS heard of this place and never gave it a chance. I came here for business lunch trip and fell in love !  Unlimited salad options (wish there would be chicken though ) but all the toppings and different types of fresh lettuce. Also if your in the mood for hot fresh soups they have that too! Pizza and pastas available as well.  For a fresh healthy alternative to fast food , this place is welcome to my diet..

I haven't been to outback in over 8 years but boy did the service and food bring back good memories and a desire to return and try other items.   We had a $50 gift card luckily from Christmas. We started off with the classic blooming onion which was fresh and quit tasty! The sauce is just okay for I think it has horseradish as a ingrediant.  Also tried the burbon bone in ribeye steak! Now this stole the show! At a price range of $30 I better not be disappointed and I WASNT. This juicy slab of meat was cooked to perfection, had great fat/meat ratio and was SOOO JUICY. Also topped with bacon and bacon bits and a savory burbon glaze. I would recommend this to anyone that loves meat sweats lol.  Also on the food docket was a ribeye melt that was a lunch hour size sandwich that was pretty good I heard from the GF and a couple adult beverages to make that meal just a little better :)  All in all a little expensive even with gift card but the staff was on top of everything and the steak was sublime. I will be back to try other carnivorous grilled perfect FOR SURE.

You know your at a good Home Depot when the following happens   1) You get 10 feet in the door and your greeted promptly with a " hi welcome yo home depot how are you"  2) When you are frustratingly looking up at where your aisle is suppose to be and before you can read you hear " Hi what are you looking for maybe I can help"    3) When you are in say the paint department and ask a random employee about a product not even in his section and he says " O that's aisle 7, all the way to the right in the back about half way up"!  And 4) When they have the Free complementary coffee taking that edge off and making you forget that you have a hard day of work ahead for that brief second.  Home Depot on Thunderbird is another location I frequent many time for there customer service , and fine selection of always stocked products...

So upon arrival I had my hesitant thoughts, but upon friends request me and a couple people gave it a try . can I say Friday Fish Fry . it was packed and smelt of a San Fransisco sea port. Which usually is a great sign  Let me start this review by saying I AM NOT a seafood lover. I had Friday fish fry at another bar a month ago and liked the fish so I thought I would give it a try again. Mistake ( on my part)  The fish was Alaskan Pollack and had a great breading! It was also fish that was "fresh" compared to other places, you can tell because it had a fish shape not the normal rectangle squares you get at other bars. I personally thought it was to fishy and could not stomach it but I know fish lovers would rejoice!!  The coleslaw was amazing and tasting exactly like KFC recipe. ! 5/5 :) The Fry's on the other had were the worst Fry's I have ever had ..  The beer prices are normal and the poor of the bartender was pretty good and strong. 4/5  The ambience I don't know how to explain. Its a hunters paradise and a veagens nightmare lol. I know its a popular bar but it lacks basic care I.e. ripped up seats, sticky menus and older decor.   All in all unless  I had a valid reason to come back I don't think I would drive to come here .   If your asking why the 4 stars then ? Simple I know its a good bar and grill just not my style.

So here's a true story. (Im gonna begin all my reviews like this from now on because it seems I run across some weird/funny business') I drive by this "auto sales lot" every single day and I have called no lie over 15 times on different days. There phone is always busy and I can never talk to someone.   I am 100% convinced this is a drug front !! They have had the same 2 cars parked in the front  I.e. a maroon/purple 2006 ford fusion and this lowered ghetto mercedes!  There lot has 2 cars , the cars have never been washed and have cobwebbs growing on the front. And in the back they have a car ,again same one thats been back there forever thats being chopped up.    Someone with friends in law enforcement please make the call and check the basement for either drugs, kids locked in cages for underage sex trafficking or human bodies.

To be completely honest I hate this Home Depot . It is in a horrible part of town and the "workers" ill call them are EVERYWHERE. I pull into Home Depot around 530 am and about 15 ft into the lot I have "workers" practically throwing themselves at my van trying to wave me down .   Also other pet pieves is that since there are so many out here (20-30) no joke every day, They have people strolling around on bikes selling you tamales, ice cream, and those chips and salsa. And my biggest laugh was during lunch one day i was working at the Carls Jr and there were about 10 of them playing soccer in thw parking lot!!! WOW   Now I have no problem with them trying to get work and make a living but when you bring 50+ people to a business Lot and it turns the lot into your own private soccer field and stadium with vendors that just drives me nuts.

I have no regrets ! . I had been to manuels mexican food the day before for lunch and had the same thing I ordered today . For an actual cheaper price and better quality Macayos delivered!  I ordered a basic cheese crisper with grilled chicken and it came out hot and really cheesy. And it was 9.95.   Manuels yesterday it was 8.95 WITHOUT chicken and seemed to barely have cheese ..  Our server was great ! He refilled our drinks every 3 min or every time we took a drink , braught multiple bowls of chips and salsa . And checked to see if we needed anything.

Danzeisen dairy is by far top notch dairy at its best! The new location on 60th ave Southern is a must visit in Phoenix if you love Milk, butter, and friendly informative visits.  Like a museum for dairy when you walk in you feel like your in dairy land Wisconsin! The employees take there cows seriously . They are very welcoming and actually have a sample station next to the registers for all there products. Needless to say I tried every milk they had and enjoyed all of them. Without a doubt the best Milk I have ever had.  The price is a little more expensive but we'll worth it knowing that the milk comes from cows tit to glass bottle  (YES a fancy glass bottle) they do require a $2 glass deposit per milek you buy but can be returned to anywhere where they sell the milk for a refund.   Check out this dairy! It will not disappoint with flavors like mocha,root beer, chocolate,strawberry,egg nog,orange sickle!

As of Harkins goes this theater is a hit or miss. If its not surrounded by gang bangers or ghetto pieces of S*** trying to impress there girl eyeballing you then its a nice place to catch a movie. My recommendation is go before 4 pm and also park right in front. Cars get broken into here daily.   Also a down side is the 2 "main" movie theaters are upstairs for big movies and during the weekday they only have downstairs concessions with 1-2 people working. So if your at a prime movie and need a refill or need to go to the bathroom you have to go all the way down stairs and takes usually 5 min to get back to your movie.   Be safe if you travel here after dark lol

Safe and convenient location. They must buzz you in through the front door and have a X-ray machine that runs a scan to make sure you are not packing.  The people are friendly and have a huge inventory of rare coins,bills and all types of currency.  I haven't bought over 50 ounces over the last half year for a investment and cool hobby that is actually fun. Check out the silver for yourself.  Only accept cash!

Tweak tweak ... I love it because its QT. But I swear there were needles and gram bags all over the floor (not really) but might as well been since im guessing about 50% of all customers were high on some sort of substance

We are at the batteries plus for business at least 1 time a week and these people are so knowlagable about all battary products . They take care care of us every time we need special ordering and special works on batteries .   I would recommend them to anyone..

A amazing sports bar for all sports , UFC fights, and if your just a billiards or darts player. They have about 10 new dart boards and around 15 pool tables which frequently have tournaments.   The beer prices are average and drinks are poured well. They have frothy glasses as well for a delicious ice cold beer :)   The waitresses are usually nice and fast to get you service and kind on the eyes ;)   Bring your ID because they check at the door. Also another benifet they have 3 security guards walking around constantly checking on the vibe of the place. So its not a sketchy place :)

Rude. Just like the other reviews say they are all correct! The staff is different everytime. And I mean everytime there are different people running the store. There is no order or procedures.    When you come in there is no hello. Just a "pickup or drop off?" It would be nice to train your employees to some customer service.   Also they pay little to nothing for clothes. We just cleaned our our closet of like 4 - 5 years went through every item for damage and most of these items were literally brand new . They didn't accept over 70% of them ??  We ended up getting $10.59 for 3 full garbage bags full of clothes. In the end we didn't need them so donating them was the right thing to do and money wasn't the issue but still.  It almost  wasn't almost worth the 2 trips to the store, cause they needed time to go through everything.

Owner was very cheery and helpful with the menu! The store is pretty small but has a warm feeling to it.   Frys were ok .. But the gyro was really good! FRESH pita bread and the meat was amazing and full of flavor.   I will def be back to try the kabobs and baklava.

Best Chinese good in the area. The owners are always working and are always nice when you come in or even take a delivery order.   The food is 4/5 star for me. I have tried the orange chicken, sizzling rice soup, all the appetizers and a couple other things and I haven't complained on 1 dish . All there food always comes out hot and fresh too.  Only complaint is the chow mein which I'm not a fan of. Just thick noodles and vegetables with bland flavors .   O well the other foods good enough to keep me coming back :)

Absolutley fantastic customer service ! I wish I knew her name but she was helping me pick out a charm bracelet and charms for a family member christmas gift , and me being a guy that doesn't exactly keep up with trends in jewelry had alot of questions.  She very kindly and patiently took her time to explain styles , sizes , and prices of all the items they had to offer. It made my experience an easy one  Way to go Monteys Hallmark !

Sammy at Interstate gave me a great deal through our company connect! The Coast rechargable flashlight is on shelf for 99.99 and I walked out the door paying $69...  The store has everything going you need from small watch battaries to industrial trailer battaries ..  Customer service is also top notch.  If your a business and you go through alot of product, check out there business pricing it can't be beat! They also have other convenient locations around the valley

Fresh coffee , greetings when you walk in , and a employee down every aisle for when you need help! What else can ya ask for.. Also this location has a hot dog guy during lunch :)   Only wish is that Home Depot in general would carry bigger size copper :( We always have to shop around for that.

Pulled up all we hear is "order when your ready"   We stated our order,  and no thank you or pull up  to the next window.  Wait 5 min....  Pull up and again no hello or anything just takes card shuts window, 30 seconds later hands us our blizzards and card back and literally shuts window again.   No customer service. Robots would be better then the snotty 16 year old teens.. it wasn't even busy, there were 3 employees inside when we pulled up and 2 cars in line.  Ice cream was good though :)

It's Pep Boys!   Things I LOVE from Pep Boys:  1) .... Thinking.... NOTHING.  A) People who decorate there car with ANYTGING from Pep Boys deserve to have that POS there driving, the sticker flames, the fake chrome and the dash buddies drive me nuts.  B) The employees always seem to be people who can't get a job elsewhere as a mechanic or sales rep. The people are lacking any social skills and customer service.   I bring in my company fleet van for a quick oil change and don't know engine size, model etc and guy makes ME go look at my engine and owners manual instead of him stepping his lazy ass outside ..  C) I can question the quality of work... This is just speculation but normally on a huge work van it takes 2 hours plus to do a inspection and oil change, I dropped my van off and was called back 40 minutes later to come pick it up. I will definitely check the oil next time I'm in the car.   This place is last stop for emergency parts/service.

A little pricey but in the end who is more worth it then your little baby!   Pros: Again pricey but always having 2 for 1 sales on toys! Usually a lot employees walking around to help out! A lot of inventory! Dog hotel, grooming and a vet all in one!  Conns: Pricey! The rewards program is a joke with no incentive Groomers don't do aggressive kitties! Grooming takes a while  (3.5 hours)   Last night our dog Maple was taken in to get a coconut wash and condition. She smelt so good and was silky smooth. They also put little bows in her hair to make her even more beautiful. They took care of my girl and I appreciate that.

Brought our work van when I got a huge nail in the top of the tire. We bought our tires from here 6 months back and they had no problem fixing me up and getting me back on the road.  Small tire shops in the valley that only deal with tires. No gimmicks or up sales that you prob don't need.   Great customer service and fast. Even if they had 8 cars in there Bay I was out in 40 minutes. I just went to lunch at a near by restaurant while they did there job.

When I go into these Ma and Pa Chinese food restaurants I kinda find it hard to believe that all these similar owners throughout AZ think this drab out dated decor is appealing to customers! I mean yes keep with authentic Chinese culture but the 1970's wallpaper and nic-nacs that have never been dusted come on!   I sat down waiting for a ride and decided to have a Sake bomb in what the call a "bar" which is 3 seats located next to what looks like a college students desk next to exam time. S*** everywhere.   After the 15 min i was there for merely a beer and small 3 shots I was charged $10.50!!! WTF long story I paid and got out of there. I do not think I will return to try there food. Anyone who can't keep a clean front where customers sit and seat I can't imagine the kitchen!

A very clean store that matches a clean urban city life near camelback. The booming modern business in the area is catchy to the young "hipsters" and also the elite older business etiquette. From party to hang out this area offers it all.   The Gelato spot is shared with a coffee house making it the ultimate chill spot for high school hangouts, college students studying, or the average bicyclist that rolls up to beat the heat.   They offer around 25 tantalizing flavors that would make even the proudest Italian proud. I personally went with the NY cheesecake. It was rich and delicious!  As a party of 3 we spent roughly $18 for 5 different small flavors. All were delicious  and I would come back again to try more. Beats Baskin Robins!

Love the manager and kitchen manager at this location. I frequent this location ALOT and always am greeted by them. They actually know what I am gonna order when I walk in the door.   Also funny is the Kitchen manager which is around my age transfers to other locations to train other chefs and we always bump into each other .   For people who say the food is gross . F U... I do love Pei Wei and defend them as much as possible . there really fast , fresh food that's always consistent. If you don't like the food go eat at McDonalds cause your pallet sucks .   Also a bonus this location has beer on tap for those special lunch breaks haha.

A good little Mexican restaurant for happy hour. A great spot for after work drinks and chips and salsa. $4.85 for a big cheese crisp and $3 dollar drafts.  I have gone here for years for the family meet up spots. Its a great location that can accommodate big tables and any budget. The parking outside is great too.   Valle Luna is a community restaurant that helps fund lots of different activities such as softball teams, baseball leagues and bowling!  They have lots of pictures on there wall of thank you pictures and plaques to all the people they have helped.   Its not the best place in the valley but worth a stop in if your in the neighborhood or with family.

Parking is HORRID among events but what can ya say when you have 1000+ cars visiting. Other then the parking the "venue" is awesome nice green grass lot in back for various shows and a Huge tent for vendors and other uses.   I went to the Barret Jackson car show in 2015 and 2013 and every time I have been impressed with the staff and the smoothness of hosting this many people . You can get about anything you can think of hear from special edition car toys, beef jerkey, direct tv hook ups and more  Also the shows that fallow are the Arabian Horse show and and Russo and Steele car show (same time ( a couple miles down) .. bring your wallet and stomach for these events for you can spend easy 200 dollars for 2 people without blinking!

This AMC is the movie theatre to go to. 1 visit here and you will never wanna go back to a normal movie theatre again.   If you have coin to drop and a date , impress her by bringing her here. The fully stocked bar and kitchen bring a nice touch to movies.   For 15$ a ticket you get a fully functional lazy boy, waiter, table and a blanket of you want it. Cruse through there full menu that adapts with winter items and summer beers. I am impressed every time I come here.  Come an hour early to get a little buzz on in there bar lounge before the movie to make that movie a little more interesting.   Also make sure to validate your parking ticket upstairs for free parking.

I couldn't say more pleasing things about this Walgreen's visit.   First of all I got greeted by 2 people just walking to the aisle I was looking for. Then the manager asked if I needed any help finding anything. 3rd is the wine I wanted was on sale for like 3.99! :)  Then when at the counter ready to check out there  was a rush of people, with only 1 cashier who was overwhelmed by 5 people in line. Another employee quickly dashed over to help and was talkative and entertaining to say the least. It actually looked like the employees at this Walgreen's liked to be at work and were genuinely Happy

If you don't like walking down aisles and aisles of zombie apocalypse sized food, your not normal!  If you don't like going shopping and being full by the time you leave by sample handouts your not normal!  If you don't like great prices and stuff that you have never seen before, your not normal!  And if you don't love fresh food, great meats , cheap gas, amazing deals, fun choices of wine and alcohol, and the best "fast food" in there deli YOUR NOT NORMAL!  You have to love this plave, although a trip is almost garunteed to break your wallet, it's a blast just going. Seriously the food court there is stupid cheap and the best. $1.50 for like a foot hotdogs AND drink!

Newly renovated and cleaned up this location is pretty legit . They just added a starbucks and has a Wells Fargo inside . The employees are helpful and check out lines are usually held up to a fast standard ..  Only complaint which is good for them is THERE ALWAYS BUSY. I live half a mile down the road and this location no matter what time or day is always busy so try to find some good parking.

Tuesday at 5 pm . 1) No a.c. in building 2 fans set up for ventilation 2) Not good food and sorta luke warm  3) Bathrooms smell like raw sewage !!!   It is very sad that a company makes 500 million a year and the CEO of the company makes 40 million a year but there resteraunts that have hard working employees at minimum wage must suffer ... so sad that this can be legal   ( I work for Fire safety and am in fast food and resteraunts almost all day long and no this is not just one occurrence , stuff never gets fixed )   SO SAD

I can't express how much I truly love Yogis Grill! It is extremely clean, has great customer service, and the beat part of course being the food is extremely good.   The Teriyaki chicken lunch combos are healthy and very filling. For $8 they give you no shortage of food!  Always impressed and this location has jalopeneos and carrots mixed for snacks or topping on the side :)

An update from another horrible review I gave 6 months prior.  It used to be a homeless shelter with drugs and crime but they upgraded the WHOLE building . A brand new start . They tore down the old building and put 100% new appliances and staff to work! Nothing assures me more of fresh food then brand new stainless steel fryers :) The staff is also pleasent with a double express drive through !   Been here 2 times since it opened and they havent messed up yet!

Man I hate this location. 2 times I have been here and every time I don't even make a transaction because I don't wanna stand in line with the 10+ plus people with 1 teller.   They don't have a drive up teller , there is no manager waiting for you to greet you or show you the new machines like other locations.   Also the 1 teller is sitting a chair doing his job unlike the 99% of other locations that have them standing and attentive. When he has to leave his computer to get change, money or whatever it takes him an extra minute just to get up and sit down and that's dumb when there already behind....   Skip this location.

We have taken Our lawnmower to this establishment for the last 2 year since moving around the corner.  The staff is friendly and will give you quotes as best they can over the phone.  Our first mess up with the lawn mower is we left it in the rain like dummies so it flooded. We brought it in to them and had it back in 2 days with a $55 dollar tag for parts and labor.   They do fast service and have pretty decent prices it seems.   My only thought is maybe they make you buy small parts you don't need. Which it still comes out cheap anyways..But last time we brought our lawnmower in we brought in all the parts that fell out when broken, and upon arrival we showed him everything and he said " o that's bent you can't use it " and our lawnmower is only 2 years old... Yes it has problems mostly cause us, but I think he was fishing..   Small family business. Support it..

If you think of what the word gorgeous means you will think of Silver leaf Golf Club. Located in a protected mountain community in Scottsdale. This property conveys modern architecture with luxury resort style service. The Golf course is maintained daily with the nicest grass and sands, also during about halfway they have a small "Stonehouse" bar and grill with a chef that has a small delicate menu.   Go back up to the clubhouse which is actually a 100,000 square foot mansion equipped with 3 bars, breakfast layout , computer rooms, conference library room, Yoga hall, a swimming pool for kids and of course a restaurant and full bar.   If you are lucky enough to live and be a member here I say to you congrats cause you have succeeded in life sir ...

Usually do not go to subway because the lack of quality in the cheeses and meats compared to places like firehouse and the better "chain" resteraunts. But me and my other employee were VERY tired from work so wr decided on this .   It was really busy probably 7 people in line but this store location was on it ! They had 4 people behind the counter and they got everyone there food in about 2 min each . Now thats what I call good training.   All in all I would recommend this location for a fast lunch.

Auto zones in general are like last minute parts you need to get your car started in a emergency. I would never take my car to get aftermarket parts from them because there parts only last a year or two .   They are also good for advice . This store though is 24 hours which is extremely nice and there employees are knowlagable . Clean store also

I agree with another review by Andrea. They were extremely slow and the cashier could not manage to come to the front and take care of the 2 guests they had .   I had enough time to read ingredients of 3 products and compare prices and ounces and still walk up to the front and look around to be cashed out. If I were a robber I could of taken stuff and nobody would have ever known.   On a positive note though I found beef jerkey for 3.99 which is awesome :)

Monopoloy is back! A very useless game that entices you to spend money on the hope and maybe getting a dream getaway. I have played for 6 years now and never won anything haha  This store is old and needs to be updated but besides that it has a Starbucks, a great staff, and a huge parking lot.   I gotta say though there liquor prices were pretty steep ! 24.99 for a small 375ml Patron???!!!

Walked in to find a tool on the way to a job and ended up asking 2 different employees (without them asking us if we needed help) and they both had attitudes like we were a bothering them.  Simply walked out and went to Home Depot and we were greeted fast and walked out with our tool needed.

Awesome mountain to climb! There are two sides for different hikes . One is a little easier and the other has more of a rock face to it but both are amazing during Arizona's Beautiful winter weather.   I came at 11:40 am on a Friday and it was packed!!! The parking lots at the bottom of the hill were full and hikers were everywhere. It is a pet friendly hill and dogs were with about 30% of the owners. So bring your best friend for some healthy fun  Also even during the winter please remember to bring water :) haha you see alot of these people on the news forgetting to bring water or not enough when there hiking miles ! Expecially in the 100 degree heat waves we have.

Normal Subway. Just a place to stop in since they open early and have semi cheap food, depending what you get. I do not normally eat subway but was craving a cold sub.   We arrived with absolutely no people inside and were taken care of promptly but the girls behind counter had a very " I don't wanna be here attitude" they were so monotoned when talking to us and speedily pushed us down the line.   Clean store , badly mannered employees.

I have been coming year with family and friends for over 7 years . Throughout high-school and with all family and family meetings. I also had a friend work here in high school and he said he the store numbers makes this is one of the busiest Starbucks in AZ.   This however does not make excuses for this Starbucks. Over 10+ times I have came here asking for a specific drink they advertise  ( let me say I do jot go to specialty coffee shops alot for I hate paying 6$ plus for a damn coffee but do appreciate a good java or Frappuccino) the salted Carmel mocha Frappuccino  is what I always try to order and they NEVER and I  mean NEVER have salt and like i said 10+ times I have been told there out of product.  They are ALWAYS packed and they never have product. The tables are always filthy weather 630 am - 330 pm the store is dirty for a Starbucks. The managers obviously need to learn to do inventory. If I wanna pay $6 for a F****** coffee you better have the ingredients expecially since every drink runs off 1) coffee beans 2) milk 3) Random ingrediant... You better have that one random ingrediant...

I love Wilhelm Automotive! All the locations in AZ have super friendly employees,  that know how to talk to there customers not above them with sometimes confusing mechanic talk.   They get to know you and are very professional about the way they conduct there business. They will diagnose the problem and always call you before any work is done and let you know what needs to be done and what can be put off.  They have fair prices and fresh coffee. Also this location has a diesel Bay for hand washing and smaller bays for other vehicles. There bays also take credit cards which is hard to find. I was at this location 15 min before opening trying to swipe my card and it wasn't working. There was a kid sweeping the property , I told him about it and he said "o let me just put some time on there for ya" He went to computer and put 20 minutes on the clock! That's like $20 in free car wash!  We always leave our vehicles with Wilhelm if we have the chance!

Ooo , ooo , ooo where to begin. I had gotten a gift card for Christmas and waited till now to order which was a grave mistake.   We got here at 4:30 PM and was notified that from 4-5 they stoke the coals and prepare the brick oven for more magic to happen. We sat down for some delicious refreshments and were greeted by Jake an amazing server. He was knowledgeable and very friendly. He made the service of this dinner memorable.   We ordered a 18" cal zone with extra mozerlla, ricotta, spicy chicken sausage, extra basil, kalamata olives, and pepperoni. WOW was it the best damn pizza I have ever had and it was HUGE. The flavors were dead on and a party in your mouth .  The price is a little steep but for a amazing eat like this and service that Jake provided I will be back again and again..

Ronnie's Cafe is a great little corner eatery for breakfast and lunch. The small but very packed restaurant is a "home style" cooking joint and gives off the feeling as your eating in your grandmas house on the farm lol.   The service is fantastic %99 even when there is 100+ people to serve.   Now here is the review on the food. Almost everything has there own take on how they make it. The chicken fried steak is good  but the breading is weird and nothing like I have ever seen , also applies to the sampler platter and fish. Just seems like they hand make everything (good thing) because the flavors and just plain look of the food is like nothing I've ever tried. Food is not the best in the world but worth a stop if your in the neighborhood.

Wow what a beautiful elder community. From the moment you pull In, to the moment you get around the property. Fresh breakfast everyday plus a little restaurant in the back for more picky eaters. They have activities for the residents throughout the day like computers set up for memory games , and classes for health like stretching and light lifting.   They also have a bar upstairs that residents have a drink and play cards . also a beautiful movie theater , library , gym , nurse , and a chapel for the religious.   I can say that the property is very well managed and the staff seems to do a great job keeping the residents happy.

Been going to Great clips most of my life lol. There just a fast , usually clean cut and the hair stylist are usually friendly . Gotta get them on there Semi annual sale for 7.99 woop woop   Haha nothing fancy but they get the job done and the stores are always clean .   P.S. if your young and have a "Hip" hair style or at least one to this generation of people. I would not reccomend going into the Sun City Great Clips lol. I made that mistake on the fly and all the cutters were like 60+ so when I told her what I wanted me being like 22 years old at the time she was like uhhhh but ill cut your hair like this anyways hahaha

First of all let me say I used to work for this "managment" when the store was located in 59th tbird... They are the rudest owners I've ever experienced. When I was training ( I was 16 first job am now 22 ) I was told to learn something and they wouldn't teach you only yell because you messed things up... also working there I have seen the guy manager yell at customers all the time because his huge ego! This is not the place to eat .. OVERPRICED.BAD MANAGMENT. AND ON DAYS BLAND FOOD. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!

Whew what a selection of what I call healthy hippy food haha ( not a bad thing ) .. a Great place to get rare items if your maybe on a diet , or just support organic non commercialized company's products.   They have multiple sample stations set up like a mini costco to try there new products and the employees seemed to care about there job .. This was my second time ever in a sprouts and I would return for a 3rd visit  if im in need of some healthy food.   FYI: A little on the pricey side for food , but  .  So far all the items we baught were delicious

So here's a true story ... i was working in a carls jr (not a employee but a vendor) and I went to grab tools I needed out of my van. Well my van has safety locks in the back meaning if you get inside and forget to keep the door open you get locked in .. well needless to say the door slammed shut on me and I got locked in!!   I called carls jr and said "hey is this the manager I was just in there working and I had to get some tools , sounds funny but I locked myself inside my van , im on the side of the building can you let me out" she said ya.  I see her walk 30 seconds later by all the windows looking out in the parking lot and she cant see me ( my van has a headache rack separating the back and front ) so im trying to wave through the headache rack and she just moves on and forgets about me !!!!   Im typing this story after sitting in my FIRE VAN for 15 min. She literally just forgot about me and continued working.

Heard about this place through family ... we were hungary in the house so we ordered   1) seamen chicken = a breaded chicken that's pretty bland with a hint of sweetness  2) mongollian beef =the worst I've ever had .. had a whole onion with little beef and literally tasted like I was chewing on a garlic clove   3) pork fried rice =pretty good I cant complain  4) crab puffs = AGAIN worst I've ever had so plain and the cream cheese inside didn't have any flavor  5) orange chicken = tasted like chicken no orange flavor ( better at panda that's sad )   Ill give it one more chance on other menu items but not impressed at all ... was cheap though ...

The people that work here are beyond kind. They define what customer service should be like. From the receptionist to the doctor they take the time to make small chat, talk to you about the issue and schedule future appointments without the feeling that your acually at a doctor for your animal.   We brought our 8 week old puppy in ... Maple :) .... For her check up and first series of shots. We were only in there for 30 min and saw a vet technician where she took basic recordings of maple and then answered all questions for us , then the doctor came in and he was really friendly right away . He went over all our options with us and told us what we should do in the future.   Also a plus to this place is they have payment plans with no interest and will work with you on what you can do. This place overall makes you feel like family from the get go and we are now on 3rd series of shots and still have no problems with this animal hospital  Thank you Westbrook Animal Hospital for taking care of my baby girl Maple !

Dustin our sales rep did an amazing job getting us the information we needed and switching us over from Verizon. They had deals that blew us away ! They bought our contract and saved us over $100 a month!   10 Gigs of date EACH and unlimited talk and text for $100 wow! We got my new phone and a IPhone 6S, 2 cases and screen protectors and our bill is $160.  I was paying $120 alone at Verizon and had to share 10 gigs of date and had a mediocre Motor X phone..   Needless to say we breathe easier now and have a lot more Data. We loved our experience at Tmobile

Yet again another review about a slow CVS and im waiting 5 minutes + to even see a cashier notice im here and to spend money in there establishment. I just went to another CVS (see review) in Chandler, AZ and the same thing happened. Its to the point where if there wasn't cameras I am 100% garunteed I could walk out with whatever I wanted .   Regardless of the loud "Ding, Dong" that plays over the speaker when I walk in.  There only convienant cause there 24/7 stores .

Always a delicious breakfast delight when stopping at Carl's Jr. Especially this location that is new and clean and the staff is welcoming.   I love how Carl's Jr is always updating the menu with new items! Seems once every 2 weeks they have a new item to there menu.

I have NO CLUE how this place has so many good ratings.   I stopped in wanting some carne Asada and pollo for a good grill night and everything looked like it has been sitting there for weeks. Literally the "cheaper cut" of carne they had looked rancid.   They had a 5 gallon bucket of "carne sauce" just sitting on the counter behind the butcher that they dunked the meet in and rapped it for you. Idk about health code but that seemed very gross to me.   The actual cans and food goodies on most of the shelf looked ancient and looked like nothing has been bought since they opened.   Now the worst part!  What goes best with carne asada on the grill. FRESH green onion and vegtables... when walking up to there sorry display case of vegetables I was horrified. They had literally 2 different choices made simple.  1) literally moldy and decayed 2) maybe 1 week old with fresh spots and decaying ends..  Carne was tastey  but after all the stuff I saw in there I won't be back. Sad cause on a small corner of 75th both mexican restaurant and carneceria are in sad shape :(  The owner and employees were really nice and that's the reason they get the second star. I hate to turn away from small local business but sadly won't be back.

What a joke! You check in and wait 30-45 min to even see someone when you know your gonna be spending $$$. There are always 2 check in people who are useless employees, they just walk around and talk to other employees if there is no one to check in.  Stuff is over priced, and always seems that you get teenager right out of high school that is dressed professional but has that attitude.   I have gone through 2 Moto X (2nd gen) in 5 months through manufactory error and the return policy is a joke. They over night it you with a 5 day return policy but when go to send it back through UPS they give you a 3 day ground return? They couldn't spring for the extra 5 dollars to overnight it back . They also start the 5 day return the DAY THEY send it out not when you get the phone. So if you got it overnighted and somehow didn't get the phone cause of a scheduling problem you would have to pay your own $ to get it overnighted or you would get charged full $ for the old phone . SCAM!

Always consistent food and always fresh ... delishish healthy option for lunch which I appreciate.   They have the new coke machines which give a option of like 1000+ drinks ..   The only thing this resteraunt chain doesnt offer is the big squint tubes of both there teriyaki sauces . You have to actually ask for these little bottles which is weird.

Food is always fresh and prompt. The Monte Cristo is pretty much to die for !   But the only argument is the price. I should never walk in at 6 am for breakfast and walk out with a $16 dollar bills for eggs juice and fruit. That is just ridiculous . I save my trips to Chompies for family breakfasts and holiday get together seeing since my wallet would not care for me to make this a everyday event.

I dont know what all the bad reviews are ?? The place is spotless and all the equiptment is new.   The employees are awesome. There always smiling and greeting you, and every time when you leave they say have a good day. Another review said when there off work there working out throwing weights and grunting loud ? Well they do work at a gym and im guessing that they like to be in good health. I would rather get told how to work out by a guy I see actually working out every day then a lazy employee sitting behind a desk just typing on a keyboard...   And at 10 dollars a month plus some little one time fees it beats LA fitness or Lifetime at 40+ a month for stuff you never use ..  Overall if you just wanna do a workout and no other bulls*** (spin class, zumba, pool laps etc) This gym is for you

After leaving such a glowing review for this gym I feel sad to say that it all unraveled after I canceled my membership here. I canceled my membership in April and was told I needed to pay the last months fee of $19.99 and a cancelation fee of $30 or so. I gladley paid on the spot and was told I'm free to go.  1 month later my card showed -$19.99 and I called and was told yea sorry they made a mistake I will be getting a refund in 7-10 business days...  After 9 days I called back and asked for a manager and the assistant manager said. " o sorry that employee must not have known how to offer a refund in the computer I'll push it through now" so okay a mistake was made I'll wait another 7-10 business days well it is 21+ days now and still no refund. Every time I call for a manager now they tell me he is not there.  This place is horrible and they will steal money of you dont pay attention to what comes out of your account !! Watch out!

This place is delicious! I do not understand the bad reviews? It's not suppose to be a regular burger its called a "steakburger" for a reason.  It's a unique ground pounded steak that is fresh and hot every time I go through. The California burger is just a loaded burger with 1000 island and everything is so fresh. Also the frys are a plus, there shoestring frys have some great seasoning on em, so addicting!   Try the custard as well everything is top notch. Always a stop for desert.

I LOVE this resteraunt. They chinese family who owns and operates it are so fast and pleasing. You cant even walk 3 feet in the door without the guy owner handing you a menu.   They have all the familiar chinese food. Kung pap chicken , beef and broccoli,  and orange chicken. I prefer there teriyaki chicken and honey chicken for when I have a sweet tooth :) pretty darn good food for pretty cheap .

Fields are amazing and we'll kept. Great for soccer games. My brother is in competitive soccer and we frequent this location alot. They have 20+ fields in different locations alot of parking and the occasional vendor (kettle corn,hot dog guy, and snow cones)  They planted trees along the sidewalk which give for okay cover granted your lucky enough to find one when there are tournaments. The parking is free which is great compared to 99th and Mcdowell which charges you $5 for dirt filled parking.  The only complaint is the ants. I do not believe they spray here cause during a 3-4 hour tournament outside baking in the sun there are ants everywhere. So get ready to get bit up and get a sun burn!

Tried the $4.95 breakfast special on Friday 4/17/15 and it was pretty darn good and cheap!  This small cafe and its own unique charm with its "regulars" that come daily and park themselves in the corner for what it seems to me hours. The server was amazingly friendly and prompt with our drinks and meals.   2 eggs any style, either 2 sausage or bacon, 2 pieces of toast, and hash browns for $4.95 how can you complain?   All in all I would come back if I was in the neighborhood and try other menu items.

Be there early cause the lines will get very long.. im talkin hundreds of people .. We were smart and got there 20 min before they opened at 10:40 . We got in right away and tryed 4 tacos stands before 11:10 :) haha   All the tacos were delish that we had and everything was running really smooth ..   Cons :  1) God made it 93 degrees with no clouds the one day the taco festival happened which weeks before it was beautiful outside.  2) The drinks were way over priced . 6$ domestics and run down margaritas but o well what do you expect .   ( Side note , there's a review on here that says " and they were serving tequila with tacos , I know weird concept right " ????? Tequila and tacos are Mexican why wouldn't they be served together WHO IS THIS GUY ?!!! LOL )

Absolutley love this place ! F starbucks! I ordered the 9-11 blended and its fantastic and we also got a blueberry pomeagranit smoothie and again fantastic !  But what took the experience to the next level being this my first time at Dutch Bros was the customer service. There were 2 different lines all the way out to the street and the coffee runners were taking the cars orders . They had a smile on and were not shy to start a conversation and make your wait a little less boring. Every employee was top notch and seemed to want to be at work!  Good job Dutch Bros!

It's been a solid 8 months since my last review and nothing has changed. If anything the restaurant has gotten better!  There new staff up front Tuu-Tuu , Jackson , Brittany are amazing and work hard to deliver the best of service.   "Big Daddy" the sushi chef is an artist with his food and is hilarious. I come frequently on the weekend to have drinks and just converse with him. He is a delight and very knowledgeable  Tom the owner will great you every time you walk through the door and makes it personal when you eat at his establishment. He takes pride in his unique flavors and crafty ingenuity that you can clearly separate Comapred to other Vietnamese places.  Well done Angelina's Team! Keep it up and I'll keep coming back week after week.

I'm gonna give this a 3.5 star review even if I can threw Yelp. Let me start out by saying the service here is outstanding. And even the pricing too! The food is where it looses stars for me.  For being literally in a Chinese cultural center I would expect amazing across the world dining. But sadly the food was mediocre at best. It wasn't horrible , but not worthy to say hey let's take a trip to eat  Service: 5/5. I could not even get half way down my drink before they filled it up. When I ate my egg drop soup and side dishes, the dishes were taken immediately when empty. The servers were nice and prompt.  Pricing: 5/5. Although probably the ultimate downfall of the quality of food, we were blown away to see a 5.95 LIST of meals which included egg roll soup entree and rice. Bill with tip was 8.50  Food: 3/5. The "sesame chicken" was a downfall from the first bite. I was expecting sweet yummness and all I got was a flat doughy fried taste :( There was no sweetness at all and the color must have been food coloring since it looked like darken brown chicken. I do give a little bit of redemption on there rice. It was actually very tasty. But all in all Rice should not be the winner of lunch.

If you haven't tried QT pizza you are missing a little joy of life. It has to be better then %99 of the pizza shops in town. The ingredients are top notch and its always made fresh!  This QT is new and is in a prime location so if ya come around rush hour be prepared to wait .

This place gets 2 stars because I LOVE the products they sell and sadly have spent over 5k on merchandise from here. (Couches , mac computer, bedroom furniture, 2 sets of Beats by Dre etc) anyways the managment here is horrible and they all have a bad attitude when your in the store for anything but buying products. The sales team make commission so yes they do swarm on you when you get in store . And my biggest pet peave is I got the one salesmen that barely spoke english !   But I love the 12-36 months 0 interest so I will bite my tongue and continue to buy :)

This is my favorite Q.T ! Not o ly is it right by my house and has the new style kitchen inside . But also has a appropriate size parking lot and space to move around . Also theres only 2 ways in the backside which used to be a strip mall that has recently 99% closed down so there's no traffic and the Cactus light, which compared to other Q.Ts that are around the I 17 is amazing .

I love these dam tacos! They are the size of my palm and only 2 bites, but for the cents they are F"$%^&*&^ delicious.  They have amazing green and red sauce that doesn't taste like watered down salsa, it genuinely tastes like fresh chilies and spices that packs heat.  Get ready for straight Mexico inside. From the green paint, to the Spanish on the Telemundo.  This place makes you feel like you are in gatalamara haha.   O also tried the basic cheese quesidilla o OMG so good. They use the white mexican cheese you get at Food City, and lightly crisp it up with butter on the flat top making it crispy and cheesy :)  Can't wait to try other menu items

Chick Fil-A is the cleanest and best ran fast food in the world. It reminds me of Q.T. on how it is ran which I wouldn't change a thing. From the spotless restaurant even when its packed, to the friendly staff. This restaurant runs on perfection and happiness.  They have quality chicken meat with the BEST breading ever. It is also hand breaded everyday in the back of shop. Food is always fresh and brought to you with your choice of over 10 condiments. You can never get bored of the menu since they have so many options! And the best part is its ALL chicken. They do there job really well with only a few basic ingredients  A great lunch spot in any area..

How this place even passes state health exams I have no clue . BEWARE. Just look over the kitchen counter and look at the sink and back area . There are a thousand flies everywhere . sauce on the floor . And everything is just caked with old grease that has not been cleaned in years.  When I walked in there were no customers and still old pizza on the table from a customer from a hour ago? A day? What... The place is filthy and disgusting

Good honest people. There name says it all Integrity .. Donna at the front desk is cheerful and always in a good mood , and will always be willing to help.   Anytime you need Fore Protection needs (backflow testing, commercial kitchen systems, backflows, fire alarms, or sprinklers and e-lights) Give them a call . They have 24/7 emergency services and technicians who know there stuff.

This is one of those stores where you hate going but you have to. Walmart is a disgusting store expecially this one , this store is dirty, has a prostitute motel in front and also attracts the crazies. I cannot stand Walmart and will avoid it whenever I can.   If you need help with ANYTHING in the store I garuntee you can look up on your phone on how to build it or find it faster then the employees can think of whats going on. And the "management team" is always never to be found . YAY for the biggest company in the world.

Was working here all today and decided to eat here. let me say this place is clean!   I tried the crispy chili rejeno combo and boy it was delicious. Full of cheese, green chili sauce and gauc wrapped in a tortilla shell for that crunch. The plate they brought it out on was bigger then a basketball! Also the beans and rice were good which I always eat first cause that usually will tell me how the rest of the meal is gonna go.  I approve!  Our waitress/ assistant manager hope was very friendly telling us about dishes, checking up on us and talkative when she came by. She is great  It's far away from my house but I would give it another go if I was in the neighborhood.

Let me start off by saying they serve Menudo everyday which is amazing since its the only restaurant I know that does that!  I ordered the Albondigas soup for start and it was pretty good 3/5 stars . The broth had good flavor. You only get 2 meatballs which are pretty good size.   I also tried the red menudo which was pretty damn good , again being able to get it everyday makes it better! Only Mexican restaurant I know to get it all day everyday. 3.5/5 stars for me! I would be back for sure to get it again.   Next I will have to try the churros and red pork burrito !

Attention Attention: I am leaving a 5 star review for Circle K!! Stop the presses! Is it possible that deep down under my hate for this company , they have a store that can impress me? I think it is.  Under a year old this Circle K should be a model of how there business should run. A clean, well maintained business that has fast pace employees that treat the customers with respect!  They also have a nicer selection of product and fountain drinks here.   But Mark my words I am %99 percent sure in 2 years I will update my review to 1 star because Circle K to me cannot hold there excellence for long. This store will just become another bad statistic like all others. But for now I will bite my tongue and enjoy it while it lasts

Absolutely the worst service ever! I don't get how this place is still in business. We arrived on Friday at 430 pm with 8 of us and walked in to a empty restaurant and empty bar. There were only 6 other people there.  The ratio from employee to customer was 3:1 but it didn't seem to matter for us since it took longer then 20 min to get our drinks. Our server was not the problem for she always checked in on us but the douche bag bartender was not in a rush. After a simple order of 8 beers was put in we waited and waited, watching the guy talk away with the girl servers after watching him grab the ticket!   Long story short the bar scene on Northern should be shut down for ALL the bars like Toby Keith's and this place hire 21 year old douch bags that don't give a F*** about you or service.

Always a delight walking into a Batteries Plus. They have all the goodies for electronics and the newest flashlights, bulbs etc... The stores are always spotless and the employees know there S*** ! You can ask them any question about any voltage and they know %99 of the time.   If you love flashlights like me this is the spot to go, they have the Stream light tactical HL , Coast Rechargeable flashlights and they put out some serious Lumens but also take serious $$$  Just give them a call from home if you have any questions on what they carry. If they do drop your product off and the turn around for installing questionable batteries is usually a couple hours!

Pretty dam good hot dog! A convenient food truck that came to the Avondale Nissan dealership when I was at work. I tried the Chicago dog polish style and it was massive and dam good! The staff is really friendly too!  Pros: 1) convenient that they come to you. 2) Friendly staff 3) They take debit cards!  Con's: 1) little expensive my huge hot dog and a can of soda was $6.50 when At has dress your own dogs $2 for $2.. 2) Menu is tiny , only 9 ingredients you can pick from and normal chips and drink.  If they would add some hotlinks or some bacon wrapped dogs and grilled bread they would hit the spot! Because it does seem they have passion and customer care they just need a update!

I love there wings here! I just moved across the street and have ordered here many times. The only place that has bar wings like Dons NY Pizza is a bar called Stackers (see review)  They taste like crispy butter with some sauce, not just Frank's Red Hot dumped onto fried wings.  They also score for there pizza I have had 3 different kinds and none have been bad. They have crispy crusts and the right amount of sauce and seasoning. Only complaint is to have fresher meats and veggies. Seems like it's all out of a bag.  They have typical specials and deliver. So far it's my go to place by my apartment

Buy.Sell.Trade your computers to this reputable company. I don't know his name but the guy with the beard has been here for many years and loves his job. He is very friendly and knows every micro chip in a computer.   They fix, diagnosis, and sell used computers and parts. It has recently gone through new management. They also finance so check them out.  I had a old labtop from 2003 in my spare room after we cleaned and decided to take it in. It had a broken hard drive and was old but still got $15 bucks YEAH ;)

Little amazing street tacos! Come on Taco Tuesday cause I really wouldn't pay $1.25 for them regular for they are SMALL! But absolutely delicious.   75 cents on Tuesday and if your hungry no joke order 10. It sounds like alot but you can scarf them down no problem. Topped with fresh onion, cilantro, and a small mini bar for salsas and other toppings your sure to knock out that craving.  I will be coming back to try other items and such for this place sparks my curiosity!
