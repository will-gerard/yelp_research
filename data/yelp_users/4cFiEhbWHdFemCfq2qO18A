Sorry,   not much positive to say.   I was craving Alfredo.   What I got was undercooked boxed pasta with no taste.   I wondered where the sauce was and found it coating the soggy garlic bread stuffing into the bottom of the dish.  Would have loved the tasty garlic bread crisp and by itself rather than soaking up all the sauce and leaving the dish very unsatisfactory.  Also asked for their specialty drink "up"  -- it came with ice in a martini like glass -- although otherwise tasty.   Good service.   But will look elsewhere for my pasta fix.

Will return for fresh baked bread chicken sandwich with fresh roasted chilies. French toast is perfect.

Worst Breakfast Burrito for too much money.  For $9 - basically scrambled eggs and a flour tortilla.   I told them not to add ham because I read on their web site before I drove over that there was bacon.  No bacon and could not taste the cheese.   I asked for light egg and potato and was talked out of it...  "we only put in 2 eggs"  Well it was one too many.   The salsa was the horrible NYC type.   We are too close to the border for that. It was nice and hot though.

Great French food. Steak au poivre is fabulous.  Scallops and guyere app is to die for. Quiet and romantic. Nice bar.

The best manicure I have had in a long time!  Choose the darling and talented, Amparo!   She gave me the best massage with the pedi and suggested a lightly buffed clear cover for my mani - it lasted the week just fading but not peeling - perfect for the simple, natural nails that I prefer. With my $50 Groupon I also received a fabulous facial and blow out.  You will love their kind, knowledgable and talented staff.
