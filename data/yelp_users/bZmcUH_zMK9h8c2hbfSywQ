Came upon this place on accident and since I'm a lover of Mexican food, thought I'd give it a try.   Overall thoughts are that I should've kept driving. Was not busy at all, 5:30 on a Thursday night.  Server seemed annoyed to have to work, and even more annoyed that I sat in his station.  I ordered a combo of shredded beef taco, cheese enchildada, and bean tostada.  The food was cold when it came out.  The tostada was literally a giant hunk of lettuce on top of a soggy cold tortilla.  I would've sent it back, however the server never came back.  When I attempted to get his attention, he (seemingly) pretended not to see me and kept walking.   The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars was because of the chips and salsa.  The salsa had good flavor (although no spice at all) and the chips were good.  I asked for hot salsa and even the hot was more "very mild" than hot.  But the flavor was very good.   All in all, I wouldn't give them a second chance.  And mostly because the manager saw me sitting at the table and he never stopped by to find out how things were either.  So, I guess the wait staff follows the lead of management.

Have been an Ulta customer for a long time, but had never tried the salon until recently.  Was a HORRIBLE experience.  My stylist, Delia, ran 45 minutes late to start me, and on several occasions during the hair cut, stopped and kept looking around.  She made various odd faces as if to say my hair was a mess.  She not only didn't listen to what I wanted, but shot down the only thing I did ask for.  She said I wouldn't look good.  At the end of the painful ordeal, she then charged me for a conditioning service I didn't ask for.  At that point she directed me to the line at the front of the store, after which I waited in, they then sent me back to the salon to make the price correction.  (happened twice, then I asked for a manager)  Was very unprofessional all around and would NEVER go back!!!

This place is UNREAL in a GREAT way!  The first appointment I had with Dr. Julie Castilla, she spent almost 45 minutes with, me just getting to know me.  That in and of itself, BLEW ME AWAY.  What doctor has the time or makes the time for that??  She does!!  The patient rooms are very comfortable and the staff makes you feel very comfortable in times that usually aren't.  All of my experiences here have been great.  You can ask as many questions as you want, and are not made to feel stupid or pressured to get you out of the office.  I had some complications today and they not only got me in, but also got me in for a second procedure so that I wouldn't have to come back.  The fact that they have a lab on site is very helpful.   I've never been to a facility where I was treated so well and felt so comfortable talking about my health issues.  I would HIGHLY recommend this practice, and Dr. Julie Ann Castilla to any and everyone!

I've come to this restaurant several times and I always hope that things will be just a bit better each time.  Each time I get the same experience.  Decent food.  Crappy service.  If I never set foot in this place again, I wouldn't miss it.  But it's one of those places that is close to the 101 and is in the neighborhood.   Chips and salsa are probably the best thing they serve.  Today I got the lunch taco's plate and the beans were old, the rice was bland and the tacos were just standard. And I had already lowered my expectations on the service based on previous visits, and they didn't disappoint.  They were just as lame as usual. Give them a star for meeting my super low expectations!

For starters, I was ignored upon entering the restaurant and standing (alone) in front of the hostess stand while the 2 kids working kept talking and doing god knows what.  I finally said, "Can I get a table?"  They said, Oh, I thought you were waiting for someone.  I guess I'm not allowed to eat a restaurant alone?? After 14 minutes of sitting and getting more frustrated, I stopped one of the 40 employees that had walked by my table ignoring me, if I could get some chips and salsa and a waiter.  A guy came (and seemed super annoyed) and dropped off a bean dip and mild salsa with chips.  I asked for hot salsa (as they normally bring you that) and he said, "you want hotter than this?"  (it was mild, and I guess being a white girl they assume I want tomato sauce? wtf??)   I ignored it and ordered a sampler plate which was to have a taquito, mini chimi, mini taco, and a green tamale.  It took 35 minutes more just to get that and the place was DEAD.  I was so annoyed.  When the food arrived it was NASTY.  The tamale had been microwaved until it was hard and one of the ends was crunchy.  The taquito was covered in brown guacamole.  Yes, BROWN.  The mini taco appeared to have a bean/meat mixture.  The only thing edible was the mini chimi, and it was like the kind you get in the frozen food section at Fry's.   I was so disgusted and tried to get the attention of someone, anyone.  I finally asked the hostess to get me someone and that's when my waiter came and said, "You wanted the check?  Here's your check."   I wanted to punch the dude, but I'm not a violent person.  Ok, maybe I am, but I know my bounds.   I figured it was a fruitless effort to waste time explaining how bad they suck.  Because all of them suck and they wouldn't have comprehended it.  So, I paid my $16 bill and left.  For the last time.  I will NEVER go back to that sorry excuse for a restaurant!!!!!

When you meet someone who has great hair, you have to ask where they get it done.  And meeting 2 people in one weekend that had gorgeous hair, I figured I better find out who was behind the artistry.  And it was Naomi C.   Let me start by saying that this salon is super unique, kind of eclectic, hipster, and not too Scottsdale if ya know what I mean.   I was greeted upon arrival and offered water or coffee.  The place is a cross between hip coffee shop, a cool boutique, and a kick ass salon.  Who knew this type of thing even existed?  (maybe a lot of you, but not me!)  Prior to going, I was a bit hesitant because I really didn't want to be in a douchey Old Town establishment.  You know, the kind you fear looking at any women in the face because the mass amounts of botox and freakish duck lips give you ongoing nightmares?  And that's not to say that there wasn't a fair share of Scottsdale women, however, there was a pretty cool crowd overall.  And all of the stylists/employees seemed very professional and very friendly.   And I guess the bottom line was the service by Naomi.  She listened to everything I had to say, offered various suggestions, and then showed me how to get the same look when I get home.  (and it seemed like something I could actually do)  I LOVE my new hairstyle and would recommend her to any and everyone!!  She didn't try to sell me a bunch of stuff I didn't need, she just treated me like I would treat one of my own clients....I'm a fan!!!!!

Let me start by saying that I was a fan of The Good Egg for a long time.  But that was probably because I was going to the one at Scottsdale Road and Carefree Hwy.   This location, which happens to be a mile from my house, is one that I have frequented the last few months.  And EVERY time I'm there, the service is horrific, starting as you enter the place. I never reviewed it because I felt a loyalty to the other store.  But today was the last straw.   I went for lunch and ordered something that I've ordered 20 times before, the santa fe straw sandwich.  The place had a total of 4 tables occupied when I got there and it took 18 minutes to get an iced tea.  When the sandwich arrived it was on this tiny little soggy bread and looked NOTHING like what it usually does.  There was also a rotten/brown piece of pineapple as a garnish...wth???  I asked the waiter, (who apparently won the personality of the year award), and he said they ran out of bread and were waiting on the "bread guy."  Piece of advice, you might want to tell the customer that, prior to accepting their order.  I was annoyed, but ate it anyway.  I ran out of tea prior to finishing the meal and of course the waiter never came back.  As I sat there fuming, hoping to get someone's attention, he came back and said, "we are selling these discount coupons for charity, did you want to buy one?"  EPIC FAIL Mr Personality!!!!!!!!!!

I would go to this place JUST for the chips and salsa.  The red and green are both very flavorful and spicy.  This was my first time going to this location and I decided to make the drive for the salsa.  They were at the My Nana's Salsa Challenge, and won, so I decided it was worth the drive.  They did not disappoint..   We ordered a plain cheese crisp, carne adovada burro, and a shredded beef burro.  Somewhat boring choices on our part, but they were really tasty.  The adovada was fantastic.  I could eat that every day, given the opportunity.  And the green salsa was just soooooooo delish!!!!! Service was a bit sketchy.  We were there tonight, on a quiet Sunday, and were "forgotten" after we got our food.  But I'd forgive a little bit of sketchy service for a re-do of those chips and salsa!!!

This place is overall fantastic.  Been going for over 10 years.  It is always consistently good.  Service is always great.  (employees seem to stay there for long time)  Hard to find a better, fresher, and less expensive place to eat.  Very good value for the money!

Out of the way spot, that is not very exciting from a decor prospective.  However the food is great.  They are consistent with their spice, flavors, etc. and I've been going there for several years and will continue.

Been going to this location all football season, every Sunday morning.  Service from Tish is great, she always remembers what we like and how we like it.   Most of the food is good, but the best thing on the menu is the Monaco Foccacia...yummm!!  The jalapeno dressing with it is delish!  The frys have skin on and are usually really greasy.  They almost seem like they are fried in dirty grease, but they taste good??  The wings are good as well.  The Sunday morning specials are great and it's always a good time.   The games are all labeled on each of the TV's so you always know who's playing where, before you sit down, which is nice.  All in all, I'd say 2 thumbs up for bar food!!

Have tried this place on 3 different occasions, the last and final one being today.  The service was TERRIBLE.  I was the ONLY person in the place and the woman behind the counter made me wait, without even acknowledging my existance while she looked through some sort of tickets. I then asked if I could place my order and then she said, (without even looking up from the stack of paper) "in a minute."  So I just stood there staring at her.  BAD start!  Food is very greasy and chicken was very fatty and majority of it was not edible.   The positive of the place is that the portion size is large.  Even the mini meal which I got today was more than enough for 1 person's lunch.

Stopped by today because it was close and they have outdoor seating.  Wanted to grab a bite and enjoy the weather.  The have great happy hour pricing on Sunday (we found out) from 1-5.  So we ordered sliders, nachos, and chicken fingers.   The portions are very large.  The nachos were a towering pile and could've fed 4 hungy men!  They were tasy, however they had some sort of creamy/spicy sauce on them that I could have done without.  Sliders were AWESOME!  The buns were toasted, the meat delish.  They had sauteed onions on them.  One burger was more than enough.  Chicken fingers were good as well.  Not greasy at all, white meat.  We got half sweet potato fries/half regular and both were very good.  They were dusted with sea salt and were very tasty.   Food was great, service was a bit slow because we were the only ones on the patio.  (except for when the smokers came out)  All in all, I'd say I'll def come back!!

Let me start off by saying that the ONLY reason we went here was to be in a dive bar that wasn't too far from home. I wanted a divey place, without the North Scottsdale douche feel.  Got here super early, like at 7:00 and left sometime after midnight.  The waitress was THE BOMB!!!  She was super on top of everything. Water never got low, drinks never got low, she was friendly without being annoying.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Did order some appetizers, and they were all typical bar food.  Nothing really stood out as great, but when you're drinking, everything tastes pretty good.   Crowd was a mix of 20 something's to 60 something's.  On a scale from Ed Hardy to Affliction, I'd rate it in the middle as there were both!  lol  But all in all, it was a good time.  Listening to the wannabe American Idol contestants do karaoke was the highlight.  And even got the chance to see a few athletes.   All in all, I'd go back for dive bar night.  It was a nice change of pace!

This is a sushi place with a funny twist. Never have I been in a sushi restaurant and heard 80's hair band music blaring from the speakers, but I must admit I kind of liked it.  Who doesn't love a little Ratt while throwing down a vegas roll??   It's small and quaint and I come here about once a month for lunch.  The lunch specials are priced well and you get ALOT of food for the price.  The service is usually very good, although this last time they made an error on my friends order and we were there waiting for over an hour which made us late for work.  But that is not the norm.  They are typically very attentive and the food is always very fresh.   I would go back again, and I do.  I'd like to try the happy hour, as they advertise $.50 appetizers??? WOW!!

Went to the spa due to a back injury and wanted to try something different.  I got Steve the owner.  He did a medical/therapeutic massage.  Was the best massage I've ever had, hands down.  I have been having massage done for years and have never had anything close to this.  Could stand straight when I left, and felt better than I had in many months.  I bought a membership and have continued going and seeing Eric.  Again, never had anything like the types of massage and leave feeling amazing.  I would recommend these guys to anyone.  If you've been going to Massage Envy, you haven't been getting a real massage!!

First time at this location and just needed brows done.  Wow, what the heck do the teach these people???  I literally left with one brown way shorter, much thinner, and not even CLOSE to looking like the other one.  My 11 year old niece could have done a better job.  And the girl who did it kept telling me she was "addicted" to waxing.  Maybe she needs to get addicted to learning about how to properly wax.  Have gone to the location in Gilbert and always had good luck.  2 thumbs down on this experience!!!!

First off, I'd like to say that I was very impressed that Kari, the GM, reached out to me after reading my first review.  This tells me that she takes Yelpers seriously and that she appreciates what clients think.  Second, she made me an offer to come back, so I took her up on it and was not disappointed!  Had a Brazilian and eye brows done, and Sara was extremely knowledgeable (and gentle where it counted).  Quite frankly, having your body hair ripped out by the roots is not a pleasant experience, but Sara was great.  I was impressed and made a follow up appointment.  So, that being said, if you give this place a shot (which I now think you should), ask for Sara.  You won't have a "40 year old virgin" flashback!!!!!!

Ok, I'm no frozen yogurt connoisseur, but this place was good.  I had a little of the "tart" and a bit of the "kiwi".  I wanted something sweet, tart, and refreshing and this didn't disappoint.  I didn't go there looking for toppings, so I'm not even sure what they had or if they were good.  I just know the yogurt was yummy and the spoons were oddly intriguing. (do those things qualify as spoons?  or rather a yogurt eating utensil?)  The price seemed fairly high from other places I've been.   The inside was clean. I sat outside as they had tables and chairs.  The girl working there was very friendly and she offered me taste's of anything I wanted to try.   The only annoying thing about the place is the GARGANTUAN size cups.  It would be cool if they had normal size cups to gauge portions better. (I realize this tactic makes them more money, but it would be nice to not have a "big gulp" size cup)  All in all I liked the place and would go back!!

I don't get it, I don't get it at all.  The hype over this place leaves me scratching my head.  The first time I went here, I thought the kids who worked there were super rude, and the sandwich was no better than a subway.  I decided to give this place a second try today.  My mistake.  The sandwich had zero taste, the bread was super dry, and the kid at the front was more interested in drinking his soda and going on break, than waiting on me. I wouldn't waste a dime or another minute on this place.

Went with a group for a Saturday happy hour because of reading about them in the Best of Phoenix.  Sat outside and had great atmosphere.  The outdoor seating was great because the table held 8 and was very comfortable.  We ordered several different apps and had the happy hour margarita's and we were not disappointed. The service was excellent and the waiter was always attentive.   Although nothing stood out as AMAZING, the overall vibe was good and and I would def go back again.

Now called Tavern Grill.  1st time I've been here, met a friend for happy hour at about 4:30.  Place was filled with an older crowd.  But didn't care about the people, as I was there for a visit.  We ordered tacos, because it's "taco tuesday" and the fish tacos were really great.  Very surprised.  The service was excellent and happy hour prices were awesome.  The location is very bizzarre and not easy to see from the street, but I liked that they had lot's of TV's.  And the food was good.  I would def go back, but wouldn't go for finding a date.  Unless of course I was looking for a gentleman in his 70's.

What I need to know is how the heck am I an AZ native and I've never been to this tucked away little gem of an eatery??   I went to lunch here today with 2 of my colleagues, and start to finish was amazing.  Started with the brie with apples & pears.  The apples were bruleed and the brie was baked to perfection.  I ordered the salmon with baby vegetables over greens, the others ordered the goat cheese/mushroom/chicken tart, and the goat cheese/mushroom crepe.  When I saw the tart, I was kicking myself for not going that route.  But one bite of the delicious salmon and I was just fine with my choice.  The baby carrots, green beans, and fingerling potato's were cooked perfectly al dente. The friends raved about the tart and the crepe.  We ended the meal by sharing the red velvet cake.  One slice was HUGE and was layered with cream cheese frosting....YUMM!!!!!  Oh, and I failed to mention that Wednesday is HALF PRICE bottle of wine day!  OMG, we totally scored!!!  Do yourself a favor and check this place out.  You won't be disappointed!
