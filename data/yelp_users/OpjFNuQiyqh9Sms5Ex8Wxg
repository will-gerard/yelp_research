Clean, nice looking and lots of different places to eat. I've had 2 short lay overs here and each time I have had to walk through the airport to get to a connecting flight so I was able to see a good portion of it. The large windows really brighten up the terminals which makes me think more places (Phoenix Sky Harbor mainly) should follow suit.

Went here because I was staying at the airport hotel 1 night. It wasn't ideal that I had to walk in an unknown area late at night, but it was a short walk and I was happy I did.  Staff was very friendly, there was good music playing on the juke box and the good was served quickly. I actually thought the bacon, egg & cheese sandwich I had was better than some big time BE&C sandwiches at well know eateries.

Quick, easy, cheap, and large portions.   I have been here 3 times for lunch and there is never a long wait and they are always quick to bring me my order. I had a teriyaki chicken bowl that came with a large amount of rice. It was just over 5 dollars. So 5 dollars for a very big lunch and it was pretty tasty works for me.   I did also have the sweet and sour chicken that I didn't care for because it was breaded and it made it seem like there was no chicken under the breading.

Bar Bianco shows how fresh ingredients make all the difference. I never mind waiting for the excellent pizza served next door, at Pizzeria Bianco, because it is always a treat to order some appetizers here. I love the cheese platter because not only are both the cheese and bread excellent, but the additions like raisins and nuts are delicious too.   Even though you may think that you need to go into Pizzeria Bianco with an empty stomach so you can have as much pizza as possible, it would be a mistake to not try some of the amazingly fresh and tasty things off the Bar Bianco menu.

I never go to BYOBs, but I gave this one a chance because of a friend's recommendation. The restaurant is in what looks like an old house that was converted. It has seating inside and outside, I was seated inside and enjoyed the decor. The service was good, but there weren't many people there, so it should have been.   For an app I had the brie and really liked how it was served. The brie itself was good, but it came with sliced pears and caramelized apples that were great. The bread was small pieces of toast and I would have liked a soft bread, but I still enjoyed it.   For my entree I had the duck, which was very tasty and it came with masted potatoes that were a great touch. I also tried the filet that was on a bed of creamy horseradish. I loved the horseradish, usually I don't care for it, but it went so well with the steak that I even tried it with the duck.   It is an expensive restaurant and I do not like that they charge a high corking fee for alcohol, but the food impressed me and it had a nice, romantic feel. I would go again, especially to try the lobster risotto on their menu.

Sakana might not be the best sushi restaurant in the valley, but it's definitely my favorite. I've always had good service and it's always consistently good. Sundays are the best day to come because they do lunch prices for the entire day.  I also love how if you order a saki bomb then you can get an appetizer for 99 cents. I've gone many times and left with a full stomach and a bill between 20-30 dollars that included alcohol. I always leave a huge tip because they take great care of me and I think the low prices are a great way to bring in customers.

This place wins the award for...........worst bacon EVER!!! I mean the worst! It's basically like when you are cooking bacon and mess up so badly you throw it out, but instead of throwing it out, they put it on a plate and bring it out for you to eat.   The rest of the food is not that good, but not as bad as the bacon. It is all pretty basic, I have gone a few times and never left saying I had a great meal. There is one close to where I live, but I'd rather drive the extra few miles to experience a better breakfast.

The store itself is a bit expensive. They do have some great things you don't usually see in a cooking store however.   But the reason I am giving them 5 stars is for their awesome cooking classes. I took a saute and sauces class and thought it was great! It was 60 dollars and 3 hours and the very next day I went to their website to look for more classes I would enjoy.   The class was about 15 people, we cooked about 7-8 dishes and then got to try them all. The chef who taught this particular class was very nice and helpful and she absolutely made me want to sign up for future classes.

I really enjoy Zinc for dinner, but their lunch menu is amazing! They have a crispy duck sandwich that I absolutely crave sometimes. Their Zinc burger is also very good and the fries you can get compliment both meals very well.   I do enjoy the dinner menu as well. I would suggest ordering the iceberg salad which comes with bleu cheese and then adding crab to it. It might seem out there, but boy is it worth it.

I wish I hand 1 more hand so I could give this place 3 thumbs down. I make better french toast in my kitchen...I am not sure if they know what vanilla and cinnamon are. The eggs were alright and the bagel was OK as well. Nothing special at all, but I was actually surprised how they were able to make their french toast so tasteless.

I'm from Philadelphia so when I first moved here I thought this place was so good, what do I know, I'm from the east coast.   The longer I have lived here, (7 years now) I realized how many Mexican restaurants are better than this place. Each time I went it got worse and worse, not only the food, but the service. Annoying things like not enough tequila in my margarita, cold meat in my taco and cold cheese on my Mexican pizza. Even if those things didn't happen I would still would not ever be going back.

My favorite Safeway there is. Always clean and the staff is always helpful. Great selection of gourmet cheeses and wines. I love the olive bar and the wide variety of nuts they have. The vegetables are usually fresh, unlike other grocery stores I have been to in the Valley.

This location usually has a wait during peak hours, but that is because it's tasty and worth the wait. I have never had anything that I didn't like. I have tried the Pablo Picasso Mexican salad, which has a really nice chipotle dressing. I have also had their artichoke dip, which is HUGE, and pretty good.  I think my favorite thing is their Italian Gold wings, it has a GREAT honey mustard sauce and there are never any stingy wings. Also great waffles fries. They have a ton of options for pizza styles too, I have never got one that I didn't enjoy.

Very good bagels compared to everything else that is around. I am from the east coast so I am used to better bagels than I get here in Arizona, but this is the best place around. I have gone here many times and have never been disappointed. I enjoy their everything bagels and cinnamon raisin bagels.   I have tried one of their lunch sandwiches before, which was also very good. If you are looking for a good, quick breakfast and enjoy bagels I would definitely suggest going here.

The restaurant was recommended to me by the chef at Digestif. He told me to come here and get the corned beef hash. So I did, and it was excellent. I had never had corned beef hash before and I was glad I tried it. It is definitely not the healthiest meal you can have, but it was a nice change.   The person I went with got the garlic and mushroom omelet. It had a thick sherry sauce covering the eggs. The sauce looked similar to gravy, which might sound weird for breakfast, but it was amazing! I have never had anything like it at all for breakfast. This sauce would be great for dinner too, with chicken or some other type of meat.   It was definitely a very filling meal, but both dishes were very good and I would suggest giving this place a try.

The Stetson Chopped salad is as good as a salad gets. They have a great way of preparing it at the table so you can see exactly what goes in to this creative dish.   I have had the salmon and halibut, but did not love either one. The next time I went I was smarter and ordered some meat dishes. The stuffed pork chop was very good and so were the short ribs.   They have some wild things on the menu that I haven't tried such as bacon chocolate chip cookies.

Excellent food! There are so many different things on this menu that are delicious. The green chile pork stew is definitely not your usual appetizer, but it is worth trying. The green chili mac and cheese is a must try. I have also ordered or tried the fried chicken, short ribs, filet mignon and the long bone rib. All are great, to be honest I have never had anything bad there.   The restaurant itself is interesting. It has a bar menu, which I have not had the chance to try, but would like it. The service has always been pretty good, not too great, but not bad. The drinks are also good, they have an extensive menu to choose from. Even though it is an expensive meal, it is definitely worth a try.

Great place for lunch! The price and the quality is excellent. It is not the best sushi in the area, but the lunch menu is very cheap and has some good options. They offer different teriyaki meals that come with rice and a salad for around 5 dollars. It is also pretty filling and sometimes I will get a roll or two to go with it.   When going for lunch the service is usually pretty good. There can be a longer wait at night and the prices go up, so I would definitely suggest trying out Kyoto for lunch if you are in the area.

This could possibly be 5 stars. Driving by you would never know this restaurant serves excellent Italian food. It is rather small and has a very different decor from other Scottsdale restaurants. I went on a Friday night and there were not many people there and I have walked by on other weekend nights and it was the same result.   Regardless of that the food was outstanding. I ordered a special, lobster risotto and it was superb. There are many other things on the menu which I would like to try as well. It is rather expensive, but well worth it. The service was also very quick, and it should be when there are not many people dining.

Atlas Bistro is exactly what a restaurant should be. When I went on a Tuesday night there were only about 2 other tables being used, so it was very quiet, which was great. Our waiter was excellent, he did a fantastic job describing each dish and making sure we always had drinks in our glasses and got us anything we needed.   I believe the menu changes often and they offer a $50 3 course meal which consists of a starter, a soup or salad and an entree. When I was there in the middle of March I was able to try many things and a couple of my favorites were the gnocchi, the prime ribeye and the pate, which was a $5 extra.   My only issue with this restaurant is it is a B.Y.O.B. and they charge a 10 dollar corking fee. Usually that wouldn't bother me, but if you are buying the alcohol from their wine store that is connected to the dining room then they should not charge that corking fee in my opinion.   Overall though I was thoroughly impressed with Atlas and look forward to going back very much.

Very good restaurant. Small, but not in a bad way. The drinks, which are a good way to start, are excellent. Strong, but in the way that a margarita should be. The lobster quesdillas are VERY good, a must try.   They prepare the guacamole right at the table. The waitress recommended a pork dish and I was not disappointed. The prices are high, but it is still worth going. This place has won best Mexican for a number of years and I can see why.

Probably closer to 4.5 stars. I absolutely love this restaurant! Not the menu you would expect at this type of place, but it's perfect. You can get great wings, waffle fries and an awesome hamburger. It's got a very different style than many other restaurants, even for a Scottsdale hang out.   Not only is food good, but they have a nice cocktail menu and they are known to fill their drinks to the tip top. They also have a bar, I have not been to it however because when I go I always want to sit down and experience their great food menu.

I really enjoy this place! It is not my favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley, but it still has very good food and it is not priced too high.   The queso fundido and guacamole are great starters. I have tried a good amount of things on the menu, but my absolute favorite has to be the blue crab enchiladas. It was a risky move ordering them, but it was so worth it. I have been here a few times and each time I have to order them.   The margaritas are also worth a try. This is probably my second favorite Mexican restaurant after Barrio Cafe.

Always a good meal here. I have probably been here around 5 times and been able to try new things each time. The crispy chicken, bbq pork tenderloin, sea scallops, short rib and chicken & proscuitto ravioli are all tasty. They each have a very unique flavor to them.   They also have some great appetizers like their smoked brie. My absolute favor thing on their menu is the tuna tartare tacos. They come with 3 tacos and they are excellent! Almost every time I have gone I order them as an app.   The restaurant itself is nice, nothing special, but they do have an area where you can eat outside, which is a nice change.

I went here on a date because it looked like a pretty trendy spot. From their online menu the drink menu also looked pretty cool. That being said I had no idea they would have an excellent burger. I was super surprised how good it was, definitely one of the best in the area. I did start noticing after that, that their burger was ranked on a few lists for best in the valley.   I also enjoyed their chicken lettuce wraps and their french fries. I would like to try some other things on their menu, but to be honest I'm sure if I went back I would get that hamburger with bleu cheese again.

After finally going I definitely believe all the hype. Everything I got was delicious; the pancakes, waffle, eggs, bacon, hash browns and even fresh squeezed orange juice. I got there at 9:20 on a Sunday and there was about an hour wait, but it was well worth it.   It is a very small restaurant, but that obviously does not stop the people from enjoying their great food. The service was on point, our food came out right away and when I ordered some extra things, that came out right away too. I would definitely like to try their lunch menu as well.

This place is always consistent. For the most part the service is always good and the food always comes out quickly. I love the red bell pepper hummus with steak, it comes with pine nuts, which Pita Jungle has made me a huge fan of.   My go-to item on the menu is the Philly chicken pita. Always the same, always satisfying. I have gone to different locations in the valley a bunch of times and never been disappointed.

I have been here twice, the first time was for lunch and was definitely a 5 star experience. Howevaaa, the second time I came was with a date and was for dinner. This time we ordered a few different dishes and I came away rather unimpressed. The hummus had way too much tahani as it had a very strong peanut flavor. I was also not crazy about the chicken and rice dish my date ordered. Both times I had gyro meat and enjoyed it, but some of the other things changed, such as the service. Dinner service was not nearly as good, which I somewhat understand because there were so many more people, but if you want people to come back to your establishment, you gotta always have good help.

This place is definitely overpriced for what it is. I knew it was expensive going in, but I thought the food would be much better. I am cool with paying 100 plus for 2 people for dinner if the food is very good, but that is not what I thought of my meal at Trader Vic's.   I do think they have a cool drink menu and the ambiance is very different. It does feel as if you left Scottsdale when you are at this restaurant and went on vacation. I just wish the food was better for the price of this place.

Excellent! Everything they have is excellent! Luckily when I went I was with a large group so I was able to try many different items. It is hard to say anything that stood out because each dish was so unique in it's own way. It is an expensive restaurant, but you know that going in and it is well worth it. Not only is their food great, but they have the best mojitos I have had anywhere I have been in the state.   Deseo has a very nice decor, the service is excellent and the staff is very helpful with explaining their menu.

Came here for restaurant week a couple weeks ago. I usually enjoy Fox restaurants, but for some reason had never come here before. For a starter I had the mini tuna tacos, which I thought were great. The taco shell was really crunchy which went very well with the texture of the tuna.  My entree was the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin. The bacon had a lot of taste, but wasn't overpowering and went well with the pork. It had a bbq sauce that had the right amount of sweet to it. What really made the entree excellent was the side dish. It was sweet corn with roasted peppers and tomatoes. It was great! Best part of the meal by far, and that shouldn't take away from anything else, it was just that good.  One reason I love restaurant week is that I get a dessert with my meal, which I usually don't ever order. I ordered peanut butter chocolate torte...so good. It came with a small scoop of peanut butter ice cream. A perfect way to end a good meal.

2 words....protein pancakes. These pancakes are amazing! They are made with blueberries and some other things including almonds. They have a taste of cinnamon also. Their eggs and skillets are usually pretty good too, but every time I go I have to get the protein pancakes.   I have never had to wait for a table, but I typically go pretty early for breakfast. The service has also always been good, never had a complaint about it. It is definitely one of my favorite places to go for breakfast.

I'll be honest, I LOVE peanut butter. I try not to keep it in my house because I can eat it at any time of the day and not stop until the jar is empty. But I do not love P.B. Loco. I think it's a great concept, they have a bunch of different, interesting flavors, but the end product is not that good to me. It is pretty runny and does not have the consistency that I enjoy. I really wanted to like this place, but sadly I didn't.

Amazingly unique restaurant, my second time here was for my engagement and it was even better than my first visit. I love their service and how even though you're there for over 3 hours you don't want to leave when the meal is over.  My date doesn't usually try new foods, but she completely trusts Kevin Binkley and knows everything he makes is fantastic.  The menu is always changing, but it's an experience unlike anything else in the state. If you're going to go I would recommend doing the 5 or 6 course tasting menu so you can see just how talented Binkley is. The price is definitely high, but if you're willing to go to this restaurant, you should absolutely  experience it the way he intends you to.

I like to think I know my breakfast spots, I have been to a ton of them in the area. I have gone to this place twice and both times left horribly disappointed.   The first time I ordered eggs and I also tried the pancakes. The eggs were actually the worst I have had in a few years. The pancakes were very dry. The only reason I went back is because I live close and I did not try their signature item, the oven baked pancake.....  ....which requires 30 minutes to be cooked. So after waiting 50-60 minutes for a freaking pancake I realized I was right the first time I came here. Not only was there nothing special about my order, but it wasn't any good. If the pancake was good it would have made up for the wait, but it didn't.   I am not knocking anyone else, but I think people who really enjoyed this place just need to get out to some other breakfast spots.

Great place for tapas! I really enjoy this restaurant for a couple reasons. 1 being that they change the menu constantly and 2 being that each item on the menu is always good. Some are better than others, but the worst thing on their menu is good.  I love going with 2 or 3 other people so we can order a variety of things and I can try new and different kinds of food. Sol Y Sombra is always a nice change of pace from other Scottsdale eateries.   Nice cocktail and wine list also.

This is another Phoenix restaurant with great ambiance and decor.   I was able to arrive before the rest of my party and had a couple drinks from the outdoor bar. The dirty martinis here are delicious! I also had a couple flatbreads (cheese & chorizo) which were both around $10. They both were very tasty and filling.   For dinner I split the forbidden rice bowl (I added chicken) and the seafood cioppino ($25). I was surprised how much I liked the rice bowl, I am not exactly sure what type of rice they used, but it was on the sweet side in a good way. Other people at my table had the hanger steak , salmon and the french onion burger, but were not that impressed with it.   I would suggest giving this restaurant a try, I'm glad I did.

The 4 stars is based on this place as a sports bar. I am not saying the food is as good as other places I have given 4 stars. That being, said I love their Monaco Focaccia! They also have good onion rings, their fries aren't great, but I don't mind them. And this might sound weird, but they have great bleu cheese, I say this because a lot of smaller type restaurants have very bland bleu cheese.   As a place to watch sports it has a bunch of televisions and they are always good about letting you know which game will be shown where. The service is always quick too, which is important when you are trying to drink and watch a game.

LOVE the desserts here! Heard about Bertha's when they had a table at a food festival. They were serving homemade pop tarts and I was so impressed I had to go to their actual location. The brownies, bar and pies were all excellent. I even had a salad there because I went during lunch time and mentally I knew I couldn't just eat sweets for lunch.  One of, if not the best, place to go for desserts in the Phoenix area.

As far as cupcakes go, this place is great! Yea, yea, yea I know it's expensive, get over it! One cupcake is like a full dessert and you know it's expensive going in so stop complaining. Alright, that's off my chest now...  The red velvet cupcake is amazing, the frosting is unreal. I also like the banana, the muffin part tastes like really good banana bread. I also enjoy the peanut butter chocolate, carrot, black & white, pumpkin and milk chocolate. There are a couple I don't love like lemon and chocolate marshmallow.   Overall the really good ones are excellent, great for birthdays and other special occasions that give you an excuse to go here.

I love the idea this place has, lots of different types of meats served on a burger in interesting ways.   Here is what I don't love about this place, the burgers are not that tasty. I had the buffalo, lamb and beef burger and none of them stood out to me at all. I did enjoy the tater tots very much, but I was coming here for a tasty burger and didn't find what I was looking for.

At first thought I would have given this place 3 stars, then I actually thought about the service and dropped it down 1 star. The food is pretty good, nothing special though. The prosciutto and mozzarella was pretty good and I kind of liked the chicken parm panini, but I definitely thought the amount of chicken on the sandwich was stingy. The price isn't high so there are your 3 stars.   Here is your review on service, SUCKED. I walked in and the waitress/hostess/bartender said hello and walked away. Then a couple minutes later she remembered that her job is to get people to a table so she told me to sit anywhere. She also was able to bring me chips instead of the side salad that was ordered and somehow I needed to turn my entire body around and stare at her to let her know I wanted to order something. She also brought my date the wrong drink, which was supposed to be cider, but instead my date took a big sip of an ale which she thought was gross. I am surprised looking back that I didn't give her a 10% tip.   I wanted to like this place, it's in walking distance from where I live, but the brain dead waitress was able to convince me to never go back again.

There is a reason this place is not getting good reviews. This place is lost! They serve basically every type of food you can have and to me that means that they can't do 1 type of food very well.   I went with a large group of people and was able to try their sushi, ribs, turkey club and a few other forgettable things. Not one thing stood out to me at all. It's a shame too because they have a great location and it seems like the owner is willing to sink in a ton of money, but they fail as a good place to grab a bite to eat.

I have been to Humble Pie multiple times and I have enjoyed it each time. If you go with only 2 people I would suggest splitting a large salad and a pizza. I enjoyed the caesar salad, one of the better caesar salads I have had when dining out. The pizzas are not very big, but they are very tasty. Excellent crust and and a very interesting selection of pies to choose from.   The service has been quick every time, never a problem with waiting for a table or waiting for food. The drinks, such as their bellini, are also a reason to go. I plan on going again to try some of their other unique pizza options.

What an awesome restaurant! It is a pretty small place, they can probably seat around 25, but I had reservations and was able to sit at the counter. Normally, I wouldn't want to sit at the counter for dinner, but I was able to watch the chefs cook the meals, which was very cool. One of the chefs was very outgoing and the service was very good.   I had the tuna tartare to start, which was excellent. It had some spice to it, which added so much more to this appetizer. I also tried the Mexican street corn and the soft tacos. They were both pretty good. I would like to go again and try some of the other things on the menu and it seems like they change their menu fairly often.   For dessert the chef convinced me to have the banana bread. Wow! It came with a vanilla dipping sauce which was awesome. Overall I would love to go again. It is not very expensive too, which is always nice, especially in Scottsdale.

I couldn't stand this place! I am actually very surprised other people gave it a good review. Aside from the service being very poor the food was nothing too exciting. I did like the spicy chicken and rice soup, however they brought me out the wrong soup the first time. I was also brought out the wrong drink too!   My date ordered a salad which was not bad, but not very good. There was too much dressing and it made everything else in the salad very soggy. I had the sweet & sour chicken, but was not impressed at all.   The food is not the worst, but I can get better Chinese food down the street from this restaurant. I do think the service was so bad that it did bring down the rating, I did get a laugh however because they seemed to mess up on everything we ordered like we were on a hidden camera show.

The food isn't bad here, it's just not that good. I think the garlic cheese knots are pretty good and for the most part the pizza is alright.   Here is my main problem with this place, they NEVER have the kind of pizza I want. For some reason they don't sell white pizza by the slice. I was once told they do have it when they open, but by the time I went at 1 in the afternoon they were all sold out. 1 in the afternoon! Do they only make 1 white pizza a day?!?!?!? They also don't sell sicilian by the slice either. 1 time they also didn't have the "special" pizza of the day also.   Give me a break, you're a pizza place, you should have the slices I want and if you don't then make it for me.

This place is definitely the best sneaker store in the valley, and probably in the state. My only problem with it is that every single sneaker is marked at the highest price possible.   I have been to other great sneaker stores in other cities, mainly Philly, and at least they have some sales and some sneaker prices marked down.   Overall if you are alright with spending a lot of money for any pair of sneaker then this is the place, because they have a much better selection than every other store around.

Good location, good service, good steak, good fries, good bread, good cocktails.   The restaurant overall has a nice set up with outside seating and an inside bar area. I wanted to order the duck, but was told it was breaded and fried so I went with the scallops. They were not great, I have definitely had better at a few other restaurants in the area.   I would suggest going there, it doesn't seem over priced and they have some other tasty looking items on the menu.

As far as food goes I REALLY enjoy The Mission, I have been here 4 or 5 times and have always liked what I've had and I've usually been able to try different things. Their brunch, lunch and dinner menus are all very good and unique.   My favorite item on the lunch menu in the Cubano Torta, it's excellent. For brunch they have really good bloody marys too. I have never actually had anything I didn't like, but like all restaurants some things are better than others.   I believe The Mission is located in an old church so the setting is different, however it is very dark and that has been a problem for some of the people I have been with (my mother mainly).   The service has been great everytime I have been seated at a table, but the two times I have gone just for drinks at the bar the service was awful. Both times I actually left annoyed because their service was so poor.   Overall, I think it's a great place to eat and an especially good place to take out of town guests who are wanting to try a more upscale Mexican restaurant.

The only reason I am giving this place 2 stars instead of one is because I was able to eat the food without getting sick. The restaurant is about 80 degrees, not ideal in Arizona in June. That sets the mood for the place right away.   I ordered the Friday special...pepperoni calzone. It was more like a pepperoni roll because it had no ricotta. Up your game fellas, ricotta in a calzone is a must. I also had a bite of a garlic knot, but that was just a waste of time.   Some other things that added to the experience were that the water button on the soda machine didn't work and they have a picture with a big beer, but don't serve alcohol.

Not what I expected. The food was nothing special, especially compared to other Fox restaurants. The restaurant itself is a nice place to go with a group of people. The margaritas and mojitos were alright, but there are definitely places to find better in the area. I was not crazy about the food either.   Overall this is not a horrible restaurant by any means, I just went in expecting better food and drink. They do have outside seating which could make the ambiance much better for a larger group of people.

This place is a Junior Varsity version of a sushi restaurant.   1. Their sign outside says they open at 12 am on Sundays, how do they not notice that mistake???  2. Their menu has typos such as their drink list which says a drink has raspherry in it  3. I ordered a very basic roll, spicy tuna, and it was no good. It tasted like it was picked up at Costco or some super market. If you can't do a good spicy tuna then I don't want to try any of their more complex rolls.

I prefer Yogurtland over pretty much any of the other frozen yogurt places in the area. They seem to be constantly changing the flavors, but always have the basic types. I like to mix flavors, but always get vanilla where ever I go, and they have the best vanilla bean.

This studio is awesome! They offer great classes for all ages and the instructors are all really good. The owner, Melissa, is a teacher and ex Cardinal's cheerleader. Check this place out!

Petite Maison is a very cute little French restaurant. It is small and not visable from a main road, but it is worth the trip. There is a fire place outside with some seating by it and also a bar and seating on the inside. If you can request a table by the fire place, do so.   Overall the food was very good, I was a little disappointed in the salad because it only had a few ingredients, but the entrees were very good. I had the bouillabaisse ($29) and enjoyed every bit of it. My date ordered the cote de boeuf ($23) and really enjoyed it. For dessert we had nutella creme brulee which was excellent.   It is not a cheap restaurant, but the food and ambiance definitely made it worth it.

AWESOME fried chicken! I could eat multiple plates of it, I wouldn't live for long, but I would definitely enjoying it. The crust of the chicken has excellent flavor and they cook it perfectly, it is also great chicken, and I mean that it doesn't have dark spots.   The waffles weren't great though and I didn't love the mac and cheese, but they do have good corn bread.   Overall, it's worth going just for the amazing chicken.

I was completely unimpressed with Grapes. I had a penne dish with marinara sauce, sausages and chicken. The sauce was so bland that you can open a jar from Safeway and find more flavor.   I also had veal piccata which I thought was very disappointing. It seemed like both dishes were missing a couple ingredients that would have given them more taste.   I truly believe that if I had a cook off with the chef I could find recipes for the same entrees and could cook two better dishes.   The service was good and I do like the atmosphere there, so hopefully they will find a new chef and the restaurant will improve.

A nice, quick, easy meal. I shared an order of burgers and fries and it filled me up for lunch. From my previous experiences when I have had sliders they are usually over cooked, but this was not the case at all. The fries are also tasty.   The seating was minimal, but I went at a good time I guess so it was not a problem for me. The price is also good, especially for how much food they give you in one order.

This is my spot! Dollar candy on Mondays and dollar popcorn on Tuesdays. The ticket price is definitely cheaper than other movie theaters around. I think the main reason I like this place is because not a lot of people come here so there is always space and it's not crowded.

I've been here twice, once for happy hour and once for dinner. If you can get there early enough for happy hour and get a seat outside, it's great. Comfortable seating, interesting people watching and pretty good service.   The soft pretzel & fondue are very tasty as was the cheese plate. When I went for dinner I had the ricotta gnocchi, which was pretty good, but not great.   I wouldn't go back for dinner again, but I did enjoy my HH experience.

LOVE that they do a happy hour on Saturday night. I just happened to come upon Mabel's and saw a sign that HH lasted until 9pm. They have a great menu for small snacks and also some good HH prices on alcohol.   I really like the ambiance in Mabel's too. It got pretty crowded around 10, but I would definitely go again for food & drinks.

The perfect place for out of town guests. If the weather is nice their outside seating is great. Really nice scenery and excellent food. I have tried different omelettes and enjoyed every one of them. The best part is that they give free baskets of their stick buns, which are amazing, to each table. I have never been to El Chorro for dinner, only brunch.   The price is definitely high, but if you dont mind paying you won't regret it.

This has been the best food event each year for the past 2 years. It's nicely set up, however this year was more crowded than the last. The range of food is always a plus, however many restaurants served small soft tacos which end up just blending together in my memory.   My favorite part of the event are the cooking demos given by chefs of well known restaurants. The chefs do a great job explaining the process of the dish they are cooking and it's definitely a nice break from the endless eating that can go on at an event like this.   I loved Relish Burger's Kobe beef burgers, so much so that I will probably try them out at the restaurant in the near future. Different Pointe of View served lobster ravioli with a delicious cream sauce. I was also pleasantly surprised by the quality of the Arizona wineries which were on hand.

Came here for restaurant week and was able to try the Samburger and Zinburger. I enjoyed both because the burgers were cooked perfectly and the toppings were very tasty, I liked the Zinburger a little bit more.   I did not care for the french fries though, they were very basic. And the desserts are huge, 2 people can definitely split 1.   Service was terrific and I liked the set up the restaurant has with bar seating inside and out.

My favorite coffee ever is served here! I've come multiple times just for a couple cups of their delicious French press. I have also had some food here and most of the dishes have impressed me. This is a crepe restaurant, but I do not love the texture of their buckwheat crepes. They do have some excellent pastries, which go really well with their coffee.  It's a small eatery, but I've never had issues with finding a table and their staff remains consistent and very friendly.

They just did a lot of work at this location, but personally I think I liked the old set a little bit more. I do like the new locker rooms and I think it is always clean here, which is very important. Every cardio machine has its own television which has spoiled me big time.   I have had to wait a few times during peak hours for a weight lifting machine, but I have never had to wait for a cardio machine. I do not ever feel intimidated by the other people who work out here, which I know is a concern for many people when going to/choosing a gym.    The front desk people are always helpful and always friendly.

Ok, ok, ok, when I first tried the steamed pork wontons and the mixfood seafood soup I did not have high expectations for the rest of my meal. I had read about Soi 4 having delicious Thai and I was excited, so the first two things I tried were a let down.   But, when the crab fried rice and the stir fried steak with onion rings came my opinion definitely changed. The steak was cooked perfectly and the onion rings were amazing. I could have literally ordered another plate and would have finished it completely. If I went back again I would like to try another starter and maybe a salad, but I would have to get the steak again, it's too good to pass up.

Came here yesterday for a quick bite to eat and got a great sandwich! I ordered the smoked turkey on ciabatta. The bread was VERY good and the turkey had a lot of flavor. The red pepper aioli spread had the perfect amount of spice to it. The smoked bacon and gouda was not over powering at all.   I was very impressed with how all ingredients in the sandwich went together. I would love to come back and try some other things like their wraps.

I have been to Butters twice, and thought it was great both times! I have been for lunch, and had the turkey burger with sweet potatoes fries, and for breakfast, where I had an omelette and pancakes. Both meals were really tasty. The prices are also very reasonable and the service wasn't great, but wasn't awful. The patio seating was great on the morning that I went.

I've been here twice and both times I left happy....and full. Last time I went I had the seafood risotto and thoroughly enjoyed it. Many times when I've ordered an entree that has an array of different types of seafood I usually get stuck with a huge plate of chewy calamari.   The bruschettas are also tasty, I really think the quality of the bread helps out a lot. A HUGE plus to Stone & Vine is that the prices aren't high, I believe the most expensive thing on the menu is $19.   It's not the best Italian food I've ever had, but it's a solid meal and reasonably priced.

I really try to judge restaurants on their food when I am writing a review, but I've been to Distrito 3 times and twice the service was just not up to par. I'm from Philly and still have family there and Jose Garcis is a big name in the restaurant industry in that city. I've been lucky enough to go to multiple eateries of his and have loved every one of them. It's a shame the people running his restaurants in the valley aren't able to do his name justice.   Old Town Whiskey has already closed, which was another restaurant of his located in the same hotel. I went once and thought it was very good, but the service there was sub par as well. Distrito's issues are just too much for me to want to go back again, even if I do enjoy their food. The last time I went a friend and I sat outside and ordered drinks and tacos. The drinks came, but after 30 minutes we realized the tacos were not. We asked for the bill and our waiter gladly got it for us, didn't mention the tacos that we ordered and we left. I understand that some jobs can be difficult, but if you can't do your job correctly then you don't deserve to have it.   The previous time I went was for dinner and we waited for a server, then waited for drinks, waited to order food and waited for refills. There are too many other restaurants in walking distance that I enjoy to waste my time, and money, at Distrito.

I LOVE how m any TV's they have here, especially the small TV at each booth. I have onlyhad drinks and an app here, but I bet it would be a good place to watch a game(s). They have a pretty good selection of beer. The only food I have tried were the fried pickles, but they were really good. Twin Peaks also has a lot of room inside and outdoor seating.

The 5 stars is solely based on their Bloody Mary. Comes in a red cup and its spicy upon request. Perfect before a flight.

Really surprised by how much I enjoyed Kitchen 18. I am Jewish, but usually am not a fan of Kosher restaurants. Excellent cuts of meat here and I am a big fan of their hummus. I have even tried their gluten free chocolate cake and loved it.  I have been here 3-4 times and only once did not come away impressed by the wait time and the staff. I'd definitely recommend Kitchen 18 to someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money and enjoys quality food.

I was very impressed with Salut. I don't often go to restaurants in Tempe, but I was happy I gave this one a try. My date and I started off with drinks and the hummus nachos. We both loved the nachos, they were served on a very tasty pita with a lot of flavor. We also split a burger and fries that was cooked perfectly. For dessert we had the s'mores, which I thought was very interesting, everyone has had s'mores, but rarely do you have the chance to order them when eating out. Overall, I liked the decor of the restaurant and thought the service was on point. Even though it's right near ASU, it wasn't your typical college hang out, which was nice when you're going on a date. I'd definitely go back to try some of the other dishes I saw at different tables.

I am a big fan of cocktails and I thought Bitter & Twisted was one of the better places in the Phoenix area. I went on a Saturday night and it wasn't very crowded, so I was able to sit at the bar and speak to the bartender as he made my drinks. It was nice because he was able to go in to detail about some of the things he was doing.   I knew I made a good choice about going here because Kevin Binkley walked in and sat a few seats away from me. I pretty much just over heard what he ordered and got the same thing. When one of the best chefs in the state is deciding on food for himself, I'll pretty much always go with what he's getting.   Whenever I go downtown for an event, I always want to start the night with a drink from here. Definitely my favorite spot downtown to get a cocktail. I recommend going for happy hour, they have some good food specials.
