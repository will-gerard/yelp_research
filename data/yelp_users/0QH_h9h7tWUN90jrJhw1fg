No matter which location I go to, I am never disappointed with Ruth's Chris.  I would live here if I could...  Feeling hungry?  Try the Porterhouse...AWESOME!

Absolutely fantastic gem of a find. Oversized, flavorful breakfast food.  Service was not so hot at 11pm, but the food was so good I didn't care.  24 hour. They had non-breakfast food,  but I did not partake.

This is no high class joint.  The elevators to the parking garage is down right scaawwry.  The casino is like being in an actual Hooters in your favorite garage sale, NASCAR-loving white trash town.  This place actually smells like chicken wings. That being said...for the price you can get this for on Priceline, you can't beat it.  It is close to the excitement on the south strip and the rooms are clean and average....a decent place to crash when you come back from having fun at other casinos.

The Super 8 of the Strip. If you are looking for a cheap place, with good location, then here you go.  Just don't expect too much.

Absolutely palatial.  The rooms are ginormous.  The beds are sooooo comfy.  There is a tv in the bathroom!  The pool area is fantastic with gardens all around.

Fantastic bone-in ribeye. Perfectly marbled. Delicious cajun rub. Great wine selection. The gumbo was great, but a little too refined...almost like a stew. Ambiance was a bit sterile. But, you're here for the steak... And it's awesome.

I love coming to this brunch/dinner spot.  I feel like it's a hidden gem.  Classy French decor with a great patio.  Typical, delicious French breakfast foods for brunch.  The lightest, fluffiest waffles.  Home made corned beef hash.  Great brunch cocktails.  Oysters and foie gras on the menu, but haven't had yet.  No reservations needed or taken for brunch.

Why all of the negative reviews?  I had a great experience with good service and tasty food. Cobb salad was good. Clam chowder was good. (I know, I need to eat healthier...but it's Vegas)  I enjoyed eating in the courtyard...right in the mix of the casino, but partitioned by fake shrubs. For Vegas, prices were reasonable.

Excellent food.  We came for lunch and weren't disappointed.  Although dinner can be pricey, lunch is not too bad and the food is worth it.  I wanted to upload a picture of the almond panna cotta, but it was so delicious, we ate it before I had a chance.

Fantastically delicious food.  Went here for breakfast and was not disappointed with a GIANT blueberry/pecan flapjack, two eggs, and two delicious bacon strips.  I am a dark roast/Starbucks/tasty coffee connoisseur, and I thought the coffee was great.

Excellent salad with filet.  Great shrimp cocktail.  Tasty wine and mixed drinks.  Awesome berries and cream for dessert.  Classy joint, just like all Flemings restaurants.  According to our server, they were unexpectedly busy for that day of the week and he was overly apologetic for slower than usual service and comped our beverage.  This is what makes a great restaurant.

Very pleased with my experience here.  Peter's work is so beautiful and extraordinary.  Having great, attentive, non-pushy, honest sales staff helps make an expensive purchase easy.  We were constantly offered any beverage we wanted.  They even ran out and purchased me Starbucks to make me feel at home.  I am a small fish in the high-roller big fish pond, but they still put in a few hours of showing me any work that I wanted.  This is how you should be treated when purchasing something expensive.

Very fun casino, especially for a younger crowd.  Always seems busy and there is a huge nice mall attached for shopping.  The casino has plenty of beautiful dancers and dealers to keep you interested.  The music is great and there is a good vibe here.

I would say this place was about 3 1/2 stars. The burger and onion rings and frozen custard were great, but not out of this world. The prices were very reasonable.

The saving grace of this place is its location.  The seating area outside has a great view of the city/rivers.  But...service was horrible.  The food was sub par.  They do have a good beer variety.  I'm sure this place does well during game time, but it's a typical sports bar.

Typical, local, cheap, dive bar with tvs.  Uninspired layout.  Average service.  Not a place I would want to hang out much.

Very limited menu. No veggie tempura?  No spider roll?  Very average.  I was not impressed, especially for being in Vegas.  There are so many other better places around to go.

Seriously?  You're thinking of eating at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas?  I only came here cause mom likes chains.  Blah.  Had to send my food back and lost my appetite.  Good service, but the food is gnarly.

You can't beat this place!  Why go to Redbox or Netflix or any of those other places when you can buy the DVD for practically the same price?  They had tons of $1.99, NEWER movies.  Many titles were $4.99 and lower.  They also had a huge selection of used video games, music, and vhs.   They have so much stuff...and since it's all used, their inventory is always changing.  They have these stores in my home town, so I always pop in to see what new stuff they've got.

About as mediocre as you can get.  Mechanical bull/ sports bar/ loud music/ etc.  Bland, boring American cuisine.  There are plenty of better options in Las Vegas.

They stray from calling it tapas, but they have magnificent small dishes.  The decor and patio are great, a fantastic setting to enjoy the great food and great cocktails.  Make sure you make reservations.

Disappointed to find out this was not Orange Table anymore. Elated to leave with the same euphoria after scarfing down OUTRAGEOUSLY delicious food from a very similar menu. Awesome pancakes, phenomenal flannels, outrageous bacon, stupendous pico. Mmmmmm. Come here!.....a hidden gem.
