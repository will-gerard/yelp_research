I didn't even want to give this location one star. It deserves no stars! I had a small box, about the size of a shoe box and the owner/clerk said there would be a $1.00 handling fee to tape the box. I said never mind and took it to another UPS store at Desert Ridge and they did not charge. A bunch of cheap asses at this location.

Bought a Travelzoo certificate for an hour massage, it was perfect. My certificate was to include lunch as well as a glass of wine. Never got my lunch and the wine was in a rip off tab glass of wine. Horrible customer service at the front desk. Was told by the manager, Lyndsey Mahalek that everything would be taken care of and two days later I notice none of it was. I was charged twice by the spa. After calling them they refunded the tip for the massage because I left cash  but that was it. Horrible, Horrible customer service. I do not recommend this place. Save your money.

I bought a travelzoo certificate and was excited to use it. It was suppose to include lunch and wine along with an hour massage. Well, needless to say I never got my lunch, the wine is a pull tab plastic prepackaged wine, and the pool is so crowded you have no where to sit. The front desk was not helpful at all. Seems like they just started that day. The manager Lindsey Mahalek said I would be taken cRe of and give us passes tickle back only to find out I was charged any ways the next day on my credit card. I called them immediately and they only refunded the lunch. Not worth the time or money at all.

Food tasted like it was cooked with cream of mushroom soup. Flavor was very gringo. Service was so so. Found a hair in the food.

Check in time is horrible!!! We arrived at 3:30 and the line was out the door so we checked our bags and came back after the show we purchased tickets for. When we got back it was 10:30 and we thought the line would definitely be gone. NOPE!!! The wait was still over an hour. It was ridiculous! The hotel did absolutely nothing to accommodate us. Avoid Aria hotel at all cost.

I have to say, I was a little nervous to come to a pawn shop and had never been till I came to Pawn 1st. I was referred by a friend. I had a bunch of jewelry that was left to me by my late grandma. Pawn 1st employees were very knowledgable, polite, were sensitive to my loss and didn't try to low ball me. I felt like I was being well taken care of. I know my grand mothers jewelry will find a better home. The store owner even came out and answered questions first hand and offered advice for other items I had of hers. Thank you Josh. I didn't know there were trust worthy businesses like this around any longer. I will definitely come back and refer friends and family.

Wow!!! I was referred to Luxxi salon because I was new to town and wanting a salon with Knowledgable stylist and that's exactly what I found. I am very picky about my color and Extentions and Jill, the owner did an awesome job listening to exactly what I wanted. She picked a color that was just the right about of change I wanted and the Extentions were put in to perfection!!! I'm addicted to Luxxi Salon now for all my hair needs. Thank you Jill!

Pizza was good enough to call in a to go order but customer service and restaurant atmosphere are lacking. They made a mistake on my husbands order so he had to wait 20 montes after my meal was brought out to get his. They did give us cannoli for their error. Not sure the restaurant  will last. Not an appealing enough atmosphere. We were never seated or greeted.
