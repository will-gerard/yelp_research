I lived at Camden my first year in AZ. Nicest staff, great pool, really good upkeep of the property. Would definitely recommend for any renters!

As you will see later, my first review written in August, I gave 2 stars for Dr Shay. I must edit the review and update on the trial of hell that has been my life. If I could give zero, I would. DO NOT GO TO THIS PRACTICE. I don't know how much clearer I can make this. It is simple. Do not go. As I have finally received a refund because Diane, the location manager, saw the previous review, I am still disgusted it took that to return my calls. And here I am again. I have been on the pill for years, yet my Dr recommended the IUD as I have no desire for children and this would "make my life easier". With the budget I am on, I asked if it was covered by my insurance. I received documentation stating it was covered 100%. That's 100%, all of it. So I said yes. Unfortunately, I had every side effect documented for this and  I needed it removed at my 6 week check up. I have never been more miserable and honestly am surprised my fianc√© didn't leave me. I would not wish those 6 weeks on my worst enemy.   That being said, I had it removed, which I had to pay $40 at the time of service for something I could have done myself. Easier than a tampon. They later credited me for the $40, as they stumbled upon another error. The following month, I received a bill for $400 for my 40% co-pay. Well, according to my insurance, this practice requires a 20% co-pay. Interesting. Lo and behold, Dr. Shay is NOT in the "full" network. This practice is an office of thieves. The stress and anguish they have caused is inexcusable. I have now been back and forth with Aetna and we all know how much of a process that can be. I am livid to pay after their office LYING to me about a procedure being covered 100%, however, the RIGHT thing to do would be to meet me in the middle with a 20% co-pay. I will NEVER return to their office. Shame on them. I obviously asked the cost because I was not in a position to pay a hefty bill and was more than happy with the contraceptive I was taking. Thank you for the lie to rape me for the money I do not have.     I will give 2 stars and they go to Dr Shay, she is a dream to this world! I have always felt taken care of with her in the last 2 years. However, that is the ONLY positive side to this review and reason I return to this office.   I am infuriated with this office and billing practices. I went to review my insurance coverage for a separate reason and discovered I was over charged $61 because they changed their billing acceptance. I received NO notification as a patient that I MUST pay at the time of my visit versus being billed. This has never been the case until my visit on 4/21/15. My insurance covers more than I was billed for and they caught me on the spot to come up with the money right then and there. I do expect to have the difference refunded; however, I am now using time I do not have to take care of this. My other concern is how many patients are they doing this to? How many other people are surprised with a  charge that is OVER what they are expected to pay because you estimated wrong?!   This practice is wrong and deceitful. Now, trying to find someone to rectify the situation and problem they have cause has taken 30 minutes of my time (most of which was on hold) and still counting. Waiting for that apparent call back. Thanks for the inconvenience. Thief.

Can I give zero stars!?! Thank you for conning me into what appeared to be an affordable flight. I now have added a few to choose my seat?! What is that?! $45 for a carry on, $40 for one checked bag?! If I didn't leave in 12 hours, I would be sure to never fly Spirit. I am infuriated with the additional cost. I haven't even left for vacation and it is starting with making my blood boil. Living far from my entire family, I travel a lot. What I thought was convenient and conducive to my life and family has cost me. I don't print money in the basement. These are costs I should not incur. I hate you Spirit. I can only hope you will go out of business charging your customers for ridiculous fees and necessary evils, like my seat. Wasn't me purchasing the flight paying for my seat?!?
