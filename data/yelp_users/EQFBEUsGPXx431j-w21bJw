After a lifetime of heavy computer work, I'd resigned myself to not seeing "quite right" for either far, computer-distance, or up close; no matter what adjustments other optometrists made whenever I got new glasses, something was always off... Until last year, with Dr Pratt. As soon as I put them on, I was astonished at the clarity at any distance. I recommend him and his office any chance it comes up.  This year I have new glasses again. Something was off and I felt disheartened. Walked in asking if he could see me. He made time to reexamine, made some adjustments in how they fit, took the time to explain where and how to view, and it's made a world of difference.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. I've had glasses that would get out of shape and I'd periodically stop in to get them readjusted. They're always happy to help. Their concern for satisfied customers is evident.  Dr Pratt has also implemented a lot of technology which makes for a very efficient experience.

They've come to my rescue several times... from replacing a trackball (previous Blackberry phone), replacing the glass on my Evo... twice (before I broke down and invested on an Otterbox). They do expert work and they're as fair and honest repairmen I've ever seen.  They have two shops: on in AZ Mills (haven't been there) and the other's on the SEC of Dobson & Baseline).

My last experience at this place has been polluting my soul since it happened. So, I've decided to "put it out there" and release this burden.  My daughter Maria had been talking about hot yoga and we saw the huge, positive change it made in her, in just a few weeks that she'd attended. She lived in Tempe and attended a yoga studio in Tempe - not sure which one, but she'd told us she'd gotten a promo package through Groupon. This got me very interested and I was delighted to learn of Hot Yoga Ahwatukee and their 2-week New Student Special. I committed fully and scheduled to attend almost every day of the two weeks.  Their online scheduling system is a super-useful tool. You get to learn about the different types of sessions, the instructors, and you reserve your spot. I was grateful for every session I attended - I thoroughly enjoyed every class and would recommend any of the instructors I experienced: Laura Czarzasty, Gabe Gavin, Sara Gordon, and Karen Santini - each with a different style, but all gifted yoga instructors. Normally, I'd ease into a physical program like this, but I'd read about "The Challenge" they were running... which is 8 weeks, so I committed to doing it for the 2 weeks of intro package. My last day would be Tuesday, July 31. I was so enthusiastic about my experiences, I was checking into Foursquare, to do my share to promote the place.  On Sunday, July 29, I come out of class feeling great and made a quick stop two doors away at Trader Joe's. I get back to my car and saw that someone with an unknown number to me had been trying to get a hold of me since I was in the yoga class. It's The Call No Parent Should Ever Get. My Little One, who was riding cross-country with a best friend who was moving back to Illinois, had been in a tragic accident somewhere in Oklahoma... and might not make it. Long story short, my husband and I flew out to be at her side; her sister flew in from Chicago, and we bid Maria farewell the following day.  These two weeks have been the most difficult and challenging time of my entire life. And, yet, our spirits have been lifted by the kindness and compassion of every single person that has crossed our paths from the moment this nightmare began... until I set foot again in this yoga studio. A knot forms in my throat as I recall this experience.  Back in Ahwatukee, as we are finalizing preparations to bury our daughter the following day, we decided to stop in to our familiar stomping grounds, at Trader Joe's - a happy, friendly place we enjoy shopping for wholesome foods. When I noticed Hot Yoga a few doors down, I mentioned to my husband that I would like to stop in to see if I might appeal to management, to see if they might consider replacing the two sessions I had booked on their online schedule but had missed due to... well, the above circumstances. Two hot yoga sessions would have been sooo soothing and renewing for my soul. Plus, having my husband with me at the time, I figured it would be a good opportunity to sign up for the next unlimited package.  We walked in to see an older blonde woman on "this" side of the reception desk. I took her to be a student, so I started telling my tale to the young woman behind the counter. She seemed a bit sympathetic and asked when this had happened. I noticed my husband having a conversation with the woman and heard him telling me something about her being the owner. (I now recognize her from this article with her photo and, yes, this is she [cringe!]: http://bit.ly/RBKB4N ) So, I directed my request to the owner, na√Øvely believing that of all places, I would surely be met with generosity in this place. Her response fell on me like a ton of bricks. She told me, and actually repeated, that the offer was for a two-week period and I had attended a total of NINE classes -implying that I'd gotten my money's worth-- and that she was not going to replace the two scheduled classes... since I didn't pay for the classes, I'd paid for the two-week time period, which had already expired.    This response, and from the owner no less, was the last thing I ever expected. So much for Namaste and all that feel-good B.S.! I feel sorry for the instructors and anyone who works here. Must be tough working for such a cold-hearted, so-and-so. On our way out, I mentioned I would be sharing this experience with my extensive network of friends. She didn't seem to care.   I read this and seems so inconsequential. Why am I making such a big deal about this? Because it hurts and because it's coming from a place where I expected some degree of compassion. I thought it best to not dwell on this bad experience and just let it go, but it's been hanging over me. I have more important people and things where I should be focusing my energy; so, again, I'm putting this out there and releasing it.

After I wrote about my bitter experience after the death of my daughter almost two months ago, I was hoping for but only half-expecting a response. Didn't get one, or so I thought. Just found this gem in my junkmail folder. This message sounds like a forced apology to me, not heartfelt or sincere -- all about her, not one word of concern for a client who is hurting badly. How sad.   Hello Betina,  I just wanted to send my sincere apologies for our exchange last week. I have felt very bad about it ever since. I understand that you will probably not ever return to Hot Yoga Ahwatukee but I at least wanted to say I am sorry.  Sandra  (That's the owner.)

We give our German Shepherd baths in the backyard during the hot, summer months, but as soon as it starts to get cooler (i.e., the water gets too cold for Zoe), we bring her in to Betty's shop for a do-it-yourself bath. They supply everything and the facilities are very convenient.   While there, we also get Zoe's nails clipped. Betty has such a good way with the dogs. She's amazing and Zoe's very calm with her.   Price is good, service is great, and the location's so convenient... NEC of Chandler and 48th Street.

Local* biz shout-out: Pet Club on Chandler -- I used to avoid shopping here, because I thought it was a posh, boutique-y sort of store, with high prices. Started going there at the recommendation of our doggie's rescue (AZ Happy Tails), as they regularly host --not sure if this particular store, but at the one in Chandler--adoption events for rescues and they help them out A LOT with food donations and more.  After shopping there several times, I can tell you that they are always friendly, helpful, carry healthful brands, and their prices are quite competitive. For instance, I ran in there just now to pick up some styptic powder and compared the price with Amazon. Pet Club was almost half the price for the same item.  * Since they have several stores, I wasn't sure if they qualified as "local," so I checked their website and I learned their corporate HQ is in Tempe. Kudos!!

Congrats and much success to new owner Mandie Beck!!  My Christmas gift to myself this year was to invite a few friends to share this experience with me -- only one of whom had any experience with paint on canvas. It's BYOB, which we did, and following Mandie's lively direction, we each came home with our own interpretation of that evening's painting. Fun time! Great location.  They also do on-site art parties, for kids, adults, corporate, special events.  Definitely worth a try!!

I'd read so many good comments about this sandwich shop in our local FB group and was glad to have the chance to stop by to try after a doc visit this morning.  It's hard to choose from the gazillion sandwiches they offer -- they had a boardful of just the faves on the wall, LOTS of 'em. Apparently, I must've hit THE fave, because just while we were there, many others came or called in asking for #51. It was a good choice. Delish!! Fresh sourdough bread, generous serving, and really fresh-tasting ingredients. Really good combo of flavors, too.  Owners and staff, all friendly and helpful. We wish them much success.   Convenient location, too, so close to the I-10, at 48th St, just north of Chandler.  Had to edit my post to add that I was very impressed by the cleanliness. I really, really appreciate eating in a place that everything you see and touch is all clean... yes, even the restroom.
