So this kid named Brendan I think that was his name anyway he treated me extremely rude and like a common criminal....... being that he was wearing two obscene diamond earrings and wearing a gun on his hip he was obviously compensating for the little man's disease so I should empathetic but whatever he's a complete ass....... He's not Noah that's for sure ( his predecessor I assume)....... As I've said before about other places your money is better spent elsewhere Til next time

I'm sure that some of the patrons of this restaurant are not going to agree with me but I can not for the life of me see any difference in the Good Egg from any of the other chain breakfast joints Denny's, I hop, Waffle House, and don't forget Perkins except for the fact that at these prices you could go to Scramble or Matt's or a few of the other great joints around the city.......... Til next time

You have got to love NYPD in my opinion it is far and away the closest thing in the valley to be sitting in the Bronx..... The bombers were even on the TV for lunch...... And the fact that Josh (mgr) gave me a new T-shirt doesn't hurt..... But seriously if you haven't ever been to an NYPD go... their all great but this one is by far my favorite..... Til next time

I just never know if it's because of my high expectations of what I think this place should or could be or if it's actually the quality of the whole experience but for whatever reason's it never seems to meet my expectations because of it's limitations but I feel most of the staff does a great job it's just that it never seems to all come together.......... Plus the beer isn't cold enough.... Til next time

So I went here last night and I have got to tell you that even though I am getting more frugal with handing out my 5 stars... but after the "Smoked Pulled Pork Sliders" this place is definitely deserving of 5 stars ................... I had brunch here I believe a couple of Sunday's ago and it was one of those bloody Mary therapy mornings and they came through with flying colors I had the corn beef Benedict and it was just unbelievable very hard to describe but when something just works and seems to come together in perfect harmony it just has to be praised....... the only and I do mean only thing I can complain about is size,....... portions and seating area are to small but that in itself is a testament to the quality of  their food leaves you wanting more and needing more room for the masses anyway I think I'm rambling now so until next time

I know the hippies are incredibly successful by taking just a kinda unique marketing (branding) but from what I can tell they have a consistent product  even with different genre and what must at least be a genuine attitude of concern for the customers wants and thoughts. Having said that I don't think telling a customer that we raised out prices by almost 20% nearly two months ago like I'm the idiot for reading there menu oh well no big deal check comes to right at fourteen dollars apx when I'm then informed has to be fifteen for delivery.........you get the point I think

No no no I did not want this to happen with this place.... I've wanted so much for them always to have great reviews from me in fact after my first review I wasn't planning on another for awhile.... Let's hope it was just a bad day.... So it started okay with the appetizer suggested by John the bartender the beef kabobs great sauce.... From there downhill..... As I said in my first review this place is great cuz they dont try to be something their not so maybe I should have stayed with the fish and opted away from a rib eye steak it was horribly under cooked to raw to break down the marbling you get with a rib eye to keep it from being tuff..... But hey who orders a steak in the middle of the afternoon right.... Asked for fresh veggies and Wasabi mashed for my side's....... Ended up with french fries and mashed potatoes huh..... So quickly they remedied the situation with snap peas which I love but there was just something off about these can't put my finger on what it was........   I'm not happy about this review but in the interest of being fair it needed to be written..... I'm sorry guys but I'll be back heck maybe it was just me having a bad day....... Til next time

So let me start this review with the embarrassing admission that I walked outside to make a phone call and have a cigarette the other night and completely forgot that I had not yet paid for my dinner and drinks which I guess is a testament to the strength of the Mai Tia's that John was feeding me all night I kept begging him to stop but to no avail...... there I did find someone to blame..... not that I am advocating this kind of behavior there was however a quiet understanding of hey I've been there before by Dana whom I emailed my apologies to immediately the next morning and was informed that it wasn't a big deal and to just cover it the next time I rolled in.......  Okay so now having said all of this I did have a point to make ........ the food, the people, the service, the atmosphere, all deserve 5 stars as they almost always do It's not that I had anything new and exciting I had the same thing I often do the Samurai beef sticks with the Butter fish pan fried.... that's the point I'm trying to make even though I had what I've had several times before it was so on point it made me want to come back again and again and again like I said in my first review they do what they do and they do it well....... Til next time    P.S. as I had said in my last review that I hoped they were just having a bad day in my opinion that is exactly what  happened for the sole reason that my great meals have for out weighed any bad meal (as in singular)  that I have ever had at Hula's

What is great about this place is that well there are several reasons it's Dairy Queen without the guilt ........ it's Churn without the cost...... It's the Pink spot without the walk "for me anyway's"and last but not least I can patronize my friend Dana M.( Hula's Modern Tiki) even if I don't have time to sit down for dinner and drinks............ Til next time
