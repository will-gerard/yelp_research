Stopped w/one of my KICK ASS coworkers for lunch last Friday.   I mean, this chain has been around for awhile and are famously known for their chicken wings and scantily-clad female servers - sounds great!! LOL  Menu items were pretty typical: burgers/sandwiches, salads, wings! I had the shrimp club sandwich and shared some wings. Salad was a tad overpriced for the quantity served. I assumed I'd be taking some back w/me, but it was pretty dainty.  I have to say, their wings are fab! I love that you can order different sauces/temps also.   Venue was very clean and orderly, including bathrooms, which I inspect w/a sharp, OCD-infused eye. Great job!

Tried this place today for lunch w/my new coworkers and boss and was instantly a fan! Love the NY/metro vibe and menu options!  Sandwiches seem to be on the higher side, but don't worry - they PILE on the good stuff. I tried their Chef Salad and it was pretty tasty but was a little disappointed they used mainly iceberg (I'm a spinach/Romaine girl).

I'm basing my review over some instances that I've had to go to their ER.  1. In VERY bad motorcycle accident where I broke my left leg, pelvis and dislocated my toe. Also had very deep road rash.  2. Two instances of painful kidney stones.  For # 1, I was transported via ambulence to the nearest hospital which meant by default, I HAD to go there as the accident happened on I-10 tunnel. I found the staff to be very gruff (in general) and the surgeon was even worse. Do not recall his last name, but his first name was "Michael". He basically told me to "try harder" when I would try to get up and stand by my bed. I kept telling him I was dizzy and felt like I had to faint. Turns out, I lost a lot of blood during the accident and was needing a transfusion. After I get 2 bags of blood, I'm good to go again! My point being, these asshole doctors really do need to LISTEN to their patients! I also had a horrid night RN come in and was a little rough and bossy to check my vitals during my week stay. How are you gonna feel if someone pokes your damn arm in the middle of deep rest in the night? No "excuse me" or anything! I remedied that be asking the Charge Nurse to never send her my way again.I also had my shoes stolen from my room. Not cool.  As for #2, I had to wait a LONG time to even be examined. I was literally in so much pain that I couldn't even sit down. For those of you who don't know how kidney stones feel, just imagine a damned cactus being shoved up your urethra. I'm not kidding. I was there pacing back and forth without any help. After pacing around and begging for something to kill the pain, the RN gave me something and had me pee through what looked like a vegetable strainer. Ughhhh.

Jack?! What the heck? You weren't on your A-game last night.  I hastily ordered seasoned, curly fries and 3 egg rolls yesterday evening after a rough day at work. Okay, and a cheeseburger. And, Sprite. I had a bad day - don't judge!  I arrived home in Fountain Hills and tore open my grease-splattered, hot bag of treats. My eggrolls were not in the bag but yet I was charged. Grrr - hate when that happens. Drive-thru lady was friendly but needs to double check bag orders to not piss off drive-thru patrons.  Plus my fries tasted like they were sitting in the warmer for awhile. Dry and crunchy. Don't be lazy staff - dump and start again. Please! :)

Hands down one of the best Mexican import store in the valley. In fact, I was rather surprised there weren't any Yelp reviews.  Located at 24th/Van Buren, this store has an obscene amount of Mexican crafts, pottery, leather goods, etc. - lots of stuff to feast your eyes on inside! Pottery is on their back patio in addition to their many rooms inside.  Friendly and helpful associates - such a great experience!!

I've never been to a "bad" JJ before - the locations I've ever visited (LA, San Diego, Seattle, Phoenix) have all been consistent and obviously very standardized. So, round-of-applause for that!  Went to the downtown location yesterday for lunch and was waiting *patiently* behind a lady who took the menu WAYYYYYY too seriously. Damn woman! It should not take 3-4 minutes to decide what smoothie you want? Should it? Or am I just an ass??  Well, anyways - the personnel noted this and started interacting w/the line (of 4 ppl) and started to get the smoothie making party started. Great job!!! But, sadly - I was not asked what free power boost I wanted in mine. I really needed extra protein yesterday so boooo! Regardless, the smoothie was fantastic - had the Light Mango-A-Go-Go.

Great, classy lounge for ppl sincerely wish to engage in conversation with others and not be in the crossfire of being in a "pickup" joint.  Merc is sultry and dark - feels intimate. Food selections are ample and appear to deliver.  Service was impeccable. Def a place to meet friends (or future dates) if I happen to be in Biltmore area.

This TJs location seems bigger/better than others. The layout of the store is wider and seems as though it has more inventory.  I did try a new Grab-n-Go salad the other day and am hooked! Try the Spicy Lemon Chicken w/Morrocan couscous. Believe there was some quinoa in there also for more substance and protein. :)  Friendly associates and unique/healthy food are always comforting to me. I still don't know why they ring that bell. Anyone? Is it a congratulatory jingle for bringing in your own bags bc your eco-friendly? Is it because you were the 100th customer and get some sort of prize? Maybe next time, I should ask.

I like our city's airport! It's centrally located and has full domestic and int'l flight options w/many, many carriers.  PHX also offers ample variety of restaurants, lounges, gift shops and other retailers.   Restrooms are very nicely decorated and very tidy/clean.  Staff, for the most part, are friendly. There are a few working in the gift shops who probably shouldn't be a Cashier in a busy airport. They were pretty irritated and crabby.  Also, would LOVE to have better signage for Terminals, etc. Or maybe it's just me? I always feel I'm frantically crossing 3-4 lanes of traffic at the last minute. Maybe I need my eyes checked.

You. Complete. Me.  Tried this lil diamond in the rough by accident. You see, Dos Molinos was closed and I needed authentic Mexican fare in my belly. Stat.  Had seafood soup and it was superb. Try that w/a cold Modelo (can) w/a lot of limes and it shouldn't disappoint!  Plus, loved ordering in Spanish - felt in made my food even tastier.

GREAT, great, GREAT place to hike! Lots of trails to select from and it's never crowded when I go (granted, I try to go on Sat or Sun around 9 or 10am).  I feel it's a bit harsh to judge this place on maps/trails/parking, but I somehow get a bit turned around when I'm trying to find a trail. But, I am a little geographically challenged too.  My favorite is Holbert trail - it's 2.5 miles and has incline/lots of rocks. Promise you that your glutes w/me hard buns of steel next morning ;)  ** NOTE: My last interaction w/one of the Park Rangers was a little strange - maybe the guy wasn't feeling well, or it was his first day, but when I asked for guidance on pointing to a specific trail, he literally stared at me like I had 5 heads and says, "Eeeeehhh, well aaahhh I dunnnnoooooo...". Thanks buddy, I will consult the trail map outside.

NOTE: This review is solely based on the catering services of the resort, not the hotel rooms.  The company I work for was having a very special luncheon yesterday, as our U.S. CEO was visiting our on-site location in Tempe all day. The 1.5 hour long luncheon was held in the ballroom but difficult to locate, to be quite frank. I carpooled with 2 other colleagues and it took us roughly 10 minutes extra just to find the correct location on their property! We couldn't find it on our own, and this is an educated group; one colleague even having her J.D.!   After busting out my Spanish with a housekeeper, as well as confirming location/event with a male associate in maintenance/groundskeeping, we finally arrived. BUT, there happened to be another event running concurrently with ours which was staged adjacent to the ballroom which had tables of low-key "boxed lunches" and other grab-n-go fare. In the back of my mind, I was thinking it was rather casual for this type of food for our CEO visit, but thought it was due to the weather being so hot and to "relax" everyone in such a stiff position (meeting a high-level executive). I was almost reaching for a small bag of chips, when one of my coworkers yelped out that this wasn't us and the ballroom was to the right of us! Ha ha! Take-away? Please, please, please use signage for any event you're having at your resort - it's a nuisance when you cannot find where to go at such a large resort.  The ballroom was nicely prepped and really represented our company well in a professional touch and "welcoming" message. There was such a high number of attendees, staff had to set up a whole new table (for our team). Food was to the right of the tables/stage and was logistically set-up well. I tried the grilled eggplant/avocado sandwich and it wasn't very edible - perhaps it was the odd dressing or some other unidentified ingredient but it didn't taste "right" to me and was completely unappealing. The fresh fruit was soo good (ripe and fresh), and their Mediterranean salad (chopped cucumbers, tomato, various olives) was superb! The vinegrette used in this salad was so refreshing on such a hot/stuffy day. Well done.   Staff does need to be more proactive in checking in with their tables; not one server checked in at our table 1x.  Also observed was the overall "aging" of the resort. Perhaps it's time for a facelift? I think the grounds are absolutely beautiful, but walking around... I dunno... it seemed "tired" to me.

You know, the older I get, the less and less I'm inclined to eat at chains. Even if they're pretty rock solid. Why you ask? Because I suppose it's bc mentally I know that if I fly to any other major, metro city, the same chain will be there and that's not fun to me. Sorta like eating vanilla ice cream every damn day.  But, CPK does do it up just right. Salads are phenom here and service is pretty impeccable. Always, always a fan of patio seating as well. Clean and good quality go along way to me.  Ok CPK, you're a chain - I ain't mad atcha I guess. XOXO!

Yes, Islands is a chain, but they do a good burger. A damn fine one.  Since my health kick started about 1.5 mos ago, I'm avoiding a lot of red meat, so I opted for a Turkey Lite Burger w/side of steamed veggies. It was a little painful as I watched my friend eat her cheeseburger w/avocado and bacon, but it was victorious.  The turkey patty was refreshingly moist and seasoned beautifully! The whole-wheat bun was not too dry either (I was worried). Steamed veggies had no salt/butter and just a tad crunchy - just how I like them!  Our server did A LOT of check-ins w/us. Very attentive.

Yep, I sure am a fan of this tucked away Vietnamese jewel. Tea Lite is located by a nail place and the Cine Capri in N. Scottsdale area. Has a small patio area to dine al fresco also, if you please.  I order the Beef Pho and it is pretty good! Spring rolls and egg rolls never disappoint me either! They turn out a very nice Vietnamese (iced) coffee too - especially when the warmer weather hits. ;)  This is also the first place that I've seen TV monitor advertising in the bathroom (on the sink hardware). Interesting place!

Let's face it, Yelpers. Going to the movies isn't a cheap date or family affair anymore. Or, was it ever? I dunno, but the breakdown (in general) is:  $8.50 - 1 adult ticket $7.00 - 1 large, buttered popcorn $4.00 - 1 box of Junior Mints candy $5.00 - 1 soda  $24.50 TOTAL  Even though movies are steep, I still like to go and this location is always clean and friendly, with theater seats that rock gently. Cheaper alternatives is smuggling candy contraband and bottle of water in your purse. Or waiting it out for HBO, or even cheaper, RedBox.

Tried Abuelo's last night with some friends. Ambience and decor are lovely.  Had Grandieza frozen margarita ($5!) that was solid and refreshing! It took me 1.5 hours to polish off due to its size and brain freeze side effect.  Huge fan of their green salsa! Sweet (like a hint of mango?) and mild.  Ordered the beef chimichanga - not the best...I guess I assumed it would be shredded beef when it was ground! It tasted elementary and cafeteria-like. But - the papas con chili?!? Soooo tasty!  A friend split the Fajitas-for-two with another friend. With their order, they received a plate of lettuce, onion, cheese. One politely asked if they could get a little more. The waiter acts like lettuce is rare and sacred and tells her "Well, lemme see what I can do". What??? Dude, make that happen - we're talking lettuce and tomato here!! Smh  No add'l fixings were provided. That's just not providing a positive customer experience, IMO.  I won't be back for a full meal, but wld entertain just having their papas and a margarita at the bar.

Let me open this review by saying I haven't been to the dentist since 2010. I'm not proud of this by any stretch, but I wanted to paint the picture for you.  For me going (almost 4 years later) to the dentist today was HUGE for me. Why? I hate going to the dentist as I have a small mouth and it's not comfortable. Plus the sounds scare me. It was embarrassing also to shamefully spill my secret to the hygienist and dentist, but I didn't want to lie...  Thank God, my mouth/teeth were in pretty good shape. The dentist was very friendly and didn't rush me either.  Only thing that made me shudder? Their exterior needs a facelift. I almost drove by it as it looks like an oil change place... Yikes.

Came in for first time this morning before work. Actually rather giddy to try new chain, deli joint.  My hopes and spirit of ordering a nice LOX on bagel were crushed, however, when I literally stood at "Order Here" area for 5 or 7 minutes. I witnessed 4 staff members behind the bar (by deli case at far end) monkeying around. I totally understand if there's a deli crisis down there, but jeez - make eye contact w/me, tell me "one minute", or even "get lost" - something! Throw me a bone, Chompie's!  The guy behind me gave up and left. I hung in there for a few more minutes. Finally, I gave up as well, as it truly boiled down to: Erin being late for work w/a Lox Bagel and some unnecessary guilt, OR Erin being on time for work (something I do pride myself on...) sans any Lox or bagel w/a clean conscience. I chose the latter, obvi.  I may return or I may not. Disappointing.

Hey! Smokers! Yeah you...!  Wanna quit paying astronomical amounts for your smoky treats at gas stations and grocers? Well, then I'd say it would behoove you to pull into this place to satisfy your nicotine habit with a little more cheese in your pocket or purse.   Prices are lower as they are located on Indian Reservation land (duh), and do offer a drive-thru. This is SO enticing for us Phoenicians living in the bowels of hell (summer months anyways). The staff members are always very friendly when I stop and seem to have good camaraderie.  Plus, I take McDowell Rd normally on my commute home (F. Hills) and it's so convenient. Happy puffing!

Bloody. Hell. Total #mindblowing eatery, here. For realz, yo.  Great location, nestled at Kierland in N. Scottsdale. Decor and ambience breathed quaint (but not pretentious or stiff) cafe in rural town somewhere in France.  Two, yes two, patios that patrons may dine. There's a pation to the left of the front entrance that is pretty practical and allows ample ppl watching, or there's an "atrium" like patio that's to the left of the inside dining area which looked amazing. Lush greens and shaded area. *swoon*  Tried the 3 cheese sampler plate (a Blue Cheese, an uber creamy Brie-type, and another hard Havarti like one). Cheeses were paired w/variety of breads (rye, wheat, etc), along w/walnuts, fruit spread, and warm (yes, warm) green olives. NOTE - this is a bit naughty... I thought I was gonna jizz in my pants, it was so good. Yes, I went there.   I had the mac-n-cheese and it was an epic moment. The shizz was served piping hot w/ham slices and homemade cheese chunks.  Service was attentive and helpful. OMG, Zinc, you are so it for me. I'll be back soon.-

Love going to Cost Plus World Markets as they carry such an elaborate selection of int'l candies, shelf-stable food, wines, etc. - especially during holiday season!  I mean, where else can you buy a meter of red licorice? I think I just found my gift exchange gift!  They seem to always have their furniture on sale as well. My mom bough a red leather chair there (cpl yrs back) and still loves it!  French-milled, fragrant soaps, incense, beads, 100% pure Virgin olive oil, Jamaican beer - there's something for everyone here. ;)

Great place for on-point Japanese fare! They offer universally known sashimi, rolls, hand rolls, etc as well as their house specialties.  But on a personal note, this venue is a jinx for me in the dating world. Every single, bloody date I have here ends up a shit show! I always figure it's a safe, non-threatening place for sushi in exotic decor.  But with all of the bad dates, I haven't had a bad sushi roll here. Do they salt their Edamame too much? Yeah. Are their prices a tad on steep side? Sure. But, I still dig 'em.  I will eat here again, but only in the presence of well-known fam and friends.

Need cool hardware for your newly remodeled bathroom? In the mood for some DIY instructional classes? Got a troublesome case of fire ants in your laundry room? How about some annoying crab grass taking over your luscious lawn?  Home Depot is the place you should be! I do have some bias here, as I believe their prices are more reasonable than Lowe's (competitor).   After all, this was one of the first credit cards I opened after I got hitched in late 2002. We're divorced now, but I'm still a loyal HD fan and have never lost the loving feeling.  Plus, the smell (think sawdust, packaging, fresh soil, and the lightest scent of pesticide) is heavenly in their stores. Wait... is that wierd??

Bought a deli sandwich (Kobe roast beef) w/cheese last night. Amazingly fresh and well-made, AJs!   All AJs I've frequented are consistently well-stocked, sterile, well-lit, and helpful service associates.  I also bought a fudge brownie from their bakery (shhh!). It was so sinfully delicious that I felt an urge to eat it on my couch under a blanket, in gluttonous shame.

If you're itching for cheap, down-n-dirty quick eats that taste nothing like authentic Mexican fare, this is your stop!  Taco Bell is the bomb - even back in the 80s! I mean, who can resist those crunchy tacos? So delish.   It is especially good after a wild night out. I can honestly say that if you eat Taco Bell when you're intoxicated and you go to bed, you'll feel pretty damn good in the AM. It makes me laugh when I find shredded cheese and tomato bits on my coffee table in the morning from my 2:30am feeding frenzy. Silly wabbit!

Let me preface this review by saying that I haven't eaten at a Schlotzsky's since around 2001. Now, I know why it's been 13 years.  I agree w/a lot of what Marc T. mentioned in his review also. The menu was rather bland and disappointing. I did opt for the Classic combo #1 and was excited as there involved some Italian cold cuts. It arrived semi-warm/toasted, but... I dunno - it just didn't appeal to me (taste, texture - everything). It was a rather confusing sandwich, shall I say? I guess I would never think to put mustard and mayo w/an Italian sandwich (cuts, black olives, etc). Plus their bread doesn't excite me either. It's too thick for me. I'll stick w/Quiznos for toasted sandwiches moving forward.  I AM stoked that they serve Cinnabon's at this restaurant because who doesn't love the gooey overload of wonder-dessert? Yes, my blood sugar spikes highly and I feel like a legless slug after consuming one, but it's so sinfully delicious.

I feel pretty swanky when I happen to stop here and shop. Not that it's snooty or anything, but they just carry EVERYTHING. I can walk out with new patio furniture, my Rx filled, storage bins, organic oatmeal, various gourmet olives picked by yours truly at the olive bar, sashimi (don't get your hopes up here, it's pricey and not that great), fresh-cut tulips, and plastic air mattress to float on when it's warm again.  Before you think I have the weirdest/most random grocery list ever, I listed these items to illustrate the wide array of stuff you can tender there. The store (just square footage-wise) is large. It would probably annoy the person who "just needs to run in for (insert item here)" without knowing the geography of the store, or if they were in a hurry. Reserve this store for times when you're just so bored (and a little hungry) you don't even know what to do w/yourself. And don't have anything planned either and can truly afford to stroll the store at your leisure.   Feeling anti-social and don't feel like facing a live human Cashier? No prob, find a self-check out kiosk and do it yerself.

Great one-stop shop to do all of your administrative tasks in one's life!  This store is clean and appears to be well-staffed (which is awesome as I've been to other Kinko's/FedEx places and it's been horrible).   Pretty decent prices on copying black/white docs, but WTH is it so high to FAX docs? Don't understand that - I faxed 7 pages to a local 602 business and it was almost $10! Seems excessive to me...

** YELP DISCLOSURE **: I am not a client/customer of tasers nor have I rec'd any type of consultation on their products, etc.  This review is only based on their 2013 Holiday "Fire and Ice" party. My dear bestie works for Taser. She LOVES working here. Love it. She invited me to be her "plus one" for their party. The party was at the HQs and obviously a lot of work AND money were placed in this grand event. I didn't eat anything, but the cake pops did look divine!  We headed up to the rooftop where all of the action was - full dance floor w/live DJ. Ice sculptures w/Taser's logo. FULL and open bar - yes! Entertainment including fire dancers who were VERY amazing. Felt like I was in Vegas. Truly.  Unforgetable holiday party. It's very obvious they really do care and have appreciation for their associates.

I feel a little like a "sell-out" for being a Walmart shopper as they have had multiple class-action lawsuits on wages as well as lots of bad publicity for poor wages, treatment of associates, and claims of not having a lot of female managers, etc.  But... they DO have better prices than Target, I must say. This particular WallyWorld is very clean and well-stocked. But, I do try to do my shopping at 6 or 7 am. Why? Because this is when the stocking crew finishes as well as when the entire store is sparkly and not a lot of ppl shopping.  Cashiers here are a hit or a miss. Depends on time of day. Some are crabby/disgruntled and barely look at me, some are very cheerful and seem to enjoy their job.

Usually I'm a pretty big Mimi's Cafe fan. Usually... However, last night was a disappointment.  Our server was friendly and attentive, however, my mom's calamari came out like 10 minutes before my dad's and my meal. That was her main meal. We encouraged her to start stabbing those rings, but she sat and waited for us. My dad ordered a side salad. Didn't come. Had to ask for it and then came, but after steak/fries arrival. I ordered Mediterranean salad w/Clam Chowder. I had to remind the server about my soup. Five minutes later, she came back empty-handed and announced they were out. That's fine - it wasn't meant to be.  My salad included their WONDERFUL muffins. Again, had to remind server about this crucial part, as I'm infatuated w/the Honey Bran muffins. I took it home and violated it.  About 15-20 minutes upon departure, I had sharp stabbing pains in my chest area. I took 2 Tums and it took the edge off. Took 2 more. Finally gone. They must have tossed battery acid w/their vinaigrette?!? Smmhhh  Sorry, Mimi's - not gonna be back anytime soon.

Big fan of Sprouts. BIG.  I mainly go for their outstanding produce selection, I'm not a registered vegan - just a lady who loves to eat healthy.  First of all, their prices on prouduce beat Safeway, Fry's, even WalMart out of the water sometimes.   Love the fact that they have bulk, dry food section - I buy my bulk quinoa, brown rice, etc there. However, be aware of the sugary bulk treats in there too (dangerous for me). I discovered plaintain chips AND cancha (dried Peruvian corn) today. Those are 2 of my weak spots but I didn't let temptation get the best of me. ;)  I do think their other items (salad dressing/cereal) are a bit pricy - so, I tend to hover around the green section.

I'll tell you what... the more times I frequent Kohl's, the more I'm slowing becoming a fan.  I am truly digging their good quality products they sell and LOW pricing! Add in their Kohl's coupons and it will cost you the change at the bottom of your purse (under your car seat for males). ;)  Even shopping during the holidays, I experienced quick lines and friendly sales associates.

If you can beat the cars competing for a prime spot in entering through their Drive-Thru, I'd recommend stopping here.  Why you ask? Well, every time I've been here:  1. Staff associates are genuinely friendly 2. Staff consistently asks appropriate follow-up questions as to not assume and mess up my order 3. Coffee, latte, mocha, et al. are always on-point and made with precision.   I tried their healthy fare Spinach and Feta breakfast wrap yesterday and am now a FAN! Not only is the calorie count lower, but it really is tasty.

Great, local grocer to fulfill my everyday needs.   Always friendly service/associates to be found throughout the store.   Deli is great - especially whoever roasts their Deli Chickens - yum! Produce seems to be fresh and "in-stock".   Love they have Starbucks also at this location.   Only drawback would be length of lines. Seems like whatever day/time I visit here, they usually are 3-4 deep at each POS. Seems excessive? I dunno.

This is the closest grocer in the Fountain Hills vicinity for me (since I live right off of Shea and FH Blvd).  I will go here ONLY if I'm lazy or if it's on my way home from work. That's it.  They don't seem to have "motivated" associates here to be honest, and out-of-stock on items. The produce section makes me want to cry, as their prices are astronomical and I just don't "feel good" in there for some reason. I even feel the celery leaves are droopier in here than other grocers. In fact, I feel for the same amount of groceries, I could have saved more at Safeway being a farther drive.   Like that they have a Red Box, but who doesn't these days?  Chase (in-store) branch located by customer service.

Wonderful place to enjoy pizza (try the Hero Pizza), calzones, and homemade pita w/Tzatziki sauce. Delicious! The service here is great as well as it's dark and cool to duck out of the 3-digit temps for a bit. Has a "Sporty/Italian" vibe to it.

The Full Works car wash for $5?! Yes, please!!  This is my sole go-to car wash. Why? Open 24/7, cheap, self-service and adequate bays to vacuum or do your tires, etc.  Plus, I love to support non-chain local business.  Easy-peasy lemon-squeezy!

This salon is ok if you're go-to salon is booked, and you're in a nail crisis bind.  I always seem to get the lady with the super short hair. Last time she gave me a fill, I had smudges and ridges in my nails. She did better this time but she's just not very friendly. I feel like a "burden" in this salon. When I was getting my pedi today, three ladies were almost at the door, the one associate sighed loudly and says "Oh my gosh!!", as if this is an inconvenience!! I felt like saying "you shld be appreciative for the business!". Just means better stability for salon and more tips!  Prices are decent and on par with their competition.

Today is the last time I'll go here for nails.  Again, I get the lady w the short hair and she chipped off part of the hardened acrylic under my R thumb, causing it to start bleeding bc it was stuck to my skin.  I understand boo boo's happen and I'm fine with that, but her reaction was not acceptable. She kept phrasing it that I did something wrong and back-peddling. I kept telling her I didn't cause anything as I've been sitting here. Silence. Finally she musters out a quiet and forced "sorry".   It was all I could do to sit there and have her finish my nails. Disappointing.

Wendy's is one of my FAVE fast-food places.  Why is this? Well, this is my reasoning:  1. Fries are to DIE for. Their seasoning is on-point as well as they don't overcook them as well as are "mealy" without being overwhelming.  2. Burgers are of substance and generous w/fixings.  3. Frosties. Well, they're just awesome and have been on the menu for decades.  4. Salads don't just consist of some lame Iceberg lettuce and a couple of tomatoes thrown on for color. They make them w/romaine and spinach. :)  Yes, they are spendier than MickyD's but you're paying for quality and consistency.

**Note: 2.5 of 5 stars, not 2.  Decent food here as I'm sure they're standardized w/their sister properties, but...  This Fountain Hills location needs some TLC, better cleaning requirements, etc. Granted, I'm pretty detail-oriented and do have mild OCD, so I noticed quite a bit of crumbs on the dining room floor on the way to the restroom. Why were these crumbs here like that? There was *maybe* 1-2 more tables than mine. Can't someone take care of these?  I had to use the bathroom, but I gotta tell you, the stench in there was foul, and... it just didn't feel "clean". I don't believe the stench was a fleeting one, if you feel me... Like maybe w/sewage? I dunno... I'm not a plumber, but it grossed me out. I noticed someone had the larger stall and had a machine making soft noises and plugged in. I just couldn't use the other stall so I just checked my hair and washed my hands. I finally realized there was probably a mother breast pumping and then I felt bad. I just felt like knocking on her stall and suggesting she try to pump next door at Subway. Or for Pete's sake - go to Petco for that matter. Just wasn't hygienic.  My chicken parm was flavorful but chicken was overcooked (dry) and I ate a few bites and the rest went in garbage. Such an annoyance... My mom's supreme pizza (thin crust) was pretty good though! For $24...  Our service was pretty good - we got check-ins and questions answered. I hope they make some changes at this location, bc I don't want to lose them in FH (we have lost businesses in the Hills in the last couple years, and that makes me sad).

Okay, so their prices are a bit higher. But, I will say that they have very friendly associates.  One day, my car tire was low and so I pulled up to the air pump. Not sure of how to get the air going (since there wasn't a coin drop), I approached the front counter.  A girl (maybe early 20s) said she wld turn it on and asked me if I had a gauge. Ummmm... Noooo... She dropped everything (told her peer to cover the front), and assisted me with the proper amount of air in my tire!! She even offered to do it for me bc she liked my nails!!! I profusely thanked her and was safely on my way.  I've forgotten her name, but always try to give them business for such a great experience!!

I'm not too crazy about writing chain business Yelp reviews, but I still do them - just because...  Denny's never, ever lets me down. Ever. Their breakfast menu items are SO good and fairly priced across the board. Lunch and dinner items are tasty as well but I prefer breakfast here for some reason.  I know exactly what I'm walking into once I enter through the glass doors and walk onto their signature dark green carpet, and it's consistently delivered. Great service, freshly brewed coffee, hot and tasty breakfasts, and a great start for the day.  A couple of my favorite menu items:  -Moons over my Hammy (never gets old and makes a decent leftover if you put remaining sandwich in oven at home)  -Ultimate Omelette (lots of protein and crunchy veggies here)  -T-Bone steak (not as good as my dad's BBQ steak, but I love their seasoning here)  -Various salads (I've never had a salad at Denny's that was not well-distributed and didn't appear fresh)

Had to unexpectedly visit Sun Devil this past Saturday *dramatic sigh* due to my car being "sluggish" as I tried to start her.  Held my breath and was hoping it was something simple (i.e. battery), and sure enought it was. Oh, and a cable of some sort?  Service was speedy Gonzalez, but they could probably be a tad more professional (i.e. techs slumped over in their chairs, fiddling on his cell, probably on Tinder app and looking to score an impulsive, hot date?). But, perhaps my expectations are too high and rigid - after all, it is a auto repair shop, it ain't the Ritz, right?!?

So, I took my BFF skating yesterday for an early birthday outing. We were both pretty nervous as it's been since my senior year in HS and for her since middle school.  I felt like a newborn calf for about 10 min, and then before I knew it, was speeding around like nobody's biz-naz! Forgot how fun skating is! So, I fell once. Concrete doesn't feel good on your tailbone. Plus fell on my wrist as I didn't want to re-injur my ACL injury to R knee. Whew! My pride was crushed more than anything... ;)  Yes, there were a ba-jillion kiddie bday parties, but if you can maneuver thru the sea of little ppl and parents being their crutch, it's also fun for adults.  Music was so-so. I didn't like the 3 seconds of total blackness either - that's a little dangerous!   Didn't try the food from the snack bar. Just didn't sound appealing.  It also smelled like a dirty foot crossed w/a stale bag of salty popcorn.

I have been treated here 2x in my life. One time was for 1 week in late 1997 for rehab (broken femur and pelvis) and yesterday to the ER for a jacked-up knee.  St. Joe rules, simply put, IMHO.  Why? Because they were so easy to find from my work, HAD my information in their system even though I hadn't been in in the last 16 years, everyone was SO friendly, and they were quick. I expected to literally be camped out in the ER and waiting for triage. Not the case. I was whisked away to a room stat. I changed rooms 3 x but everyone I met along the way communicated and explained WHY I was moving and when, etc.  I love explanations and updates - especially when we're talking about my own health. I take it very seriously and consider it sacred.  I would recommend this hospital to anyone. Fabulous job!!!

I've frequented Gilligins since moving here (time #1) in late 1998. It was a great place then, and is a great place now. Hasn't changed a bit, actually.  If you're looking for a swanky/trendy place full of political correctness, you may consider not coming here. If you're seeking a place where all of the Scottsdale pretties come out and act hoity-toity, you may bypass this place all together.  Drinks are cheap AND heavy pour. Be careful.  Food is pretty much all fried and all BAD for you.  Does it smell like stale beer and chicken noodle soup body odor? Yes, yes it does. But if you can tolerate this and looking for a dive w/a bit of personality, I think you have found a gem.  BTW: I had a celeb sighting here once - back in 2000 - it was Dustin Diamond (Screech, from Saved by the Bell). I don't hold this against the venue.

I had high hopes filling 2 of my Rxs here the other day, but after sitting on my rump for 20-25 minutes, some dorky Pharm Tech summons me to the counter for dialogue.  One of the Rx was partially out-of-stock. They were able to give me 15 pills on a Friday, and drive back the following Monday for the remaining 15. Okay. Pain in my ass a little but whatever.  The 2nd Rx pissed me off. He told me this one was "too early to fill". I completely agreed with him if one were to look at days on a calendar, but it was for a completely different dose (lower) and time to take dose. I was under the impression that this would trump the stupid wait period thing, as a CVS had once educated me on this. Well, not here. Okay, that's fine - do whatcha gotta do, Boo, but - couldn't you tell me all of this bad news like within 5 min or 10 min of my arrival?? Nice wasted lunch break!! Thank you!

Bought my very first Speedy bag here. I will always have my Speedy and she will remain a timeless classic, as would any Chanel piece, etc.  Felt very welcome in their store and sales associates were all very friendly and helpful.  Yes, I am a bit of an LV fanatical. Once you buy one, you're hooked for life. *sigh*

This place is a little gem! Seemed rather sultry and exotic to me w/their lack of lighting, live music and leather couches. I mean I'm talking REALLY dark which can either come across as mysterious and romantic, or akin to stumbling across a secret society of Satanists performing rituals involving goats. Just watch your step if you have had a few.   They have a smaller dance floor and intimate setting (code word for SMALL)!  Our server was very attentive and friendly. I really don't have any complaints!

I have been a pretty faithful fan of Nordy's since 1975 (my year of birth).  I'm from WA state, so my mom would always take me up north to downtown Seattle for school clothes shopping, etc. We would always have lunch at Nordstrom Cafe. It was pretty much mother-daughter tradition. :)  I became a Nordy's card-holder in 1996, while I was still in college. NOTE: I REALLY had no business/means to have this coveted CC, as I had a measly, part-time janitor/sandwich maker job. But still...  You can find a rather wide variety of brands/designers but thank GOD for the sales (i.e. Semi-Annual Sale) as well as Clearance sections. This is a true gold mine.  I hate buying stuff full price. I mean, even if I were a very wealthy woman, I would hate to pay full retail. It's the principle, I guess. But, if you do have some time on your hands and don't mind checking multiple departments, go for it.  Besides that - I have never been mistreated in a Nordy's. Ever. Their customer service is very high and associates truly go above and beyond for shoppers - and that's in pretty much every department.  I can remember returning Birkenstocks during the HUGE fad in 1993 to them. I was never questioned, drilled, etc on why the soles "shrunk" up due to me abusing my poor sandals and leaving them in my sun-scorched car. Associate took my deformed shoes and gave me replacement pair. Done.  Same thing for a pair of Doc Maartens in 1995 - no questions, just new, replacement pair.

Loving their during-the-summer-happy-hour-never-expires credo! Very nice.  I went here after work one evening and the place was packed (on a Wed or Thurs, maybe) w/HH/dinner crowds - always a good sign. Bar tables were occupied so I sat out on patio - don't worry, it was shaded w/misters around perimeter. Classy yet un-pretentious vibe that I sensed also.   Service was quick, friendly, and communication was ongoing throughout the evening - 5 stars there!   I tried their Huckleberry Marg - so delicious! Plus, loved their presentation - huckleberry (preserve?) at bottom layer, then frozen marg, then one huckleberry dollop on top center. Sorta reminded me of a nipple, but was refreshing nevertheless.  Since it was my 1x/week cheat-from-diet day, I ordered the kettle pork app w/flour tortillas. So dreamy! I had one, but then my internal guilt was screaming at me to refrain from 86-ing the rest, so I had the server sweep my goodness away. Booo!   Also ordered the Peach Arnold Palmer. It was just "eh" for me. Overkill of the peach flavoring and really sweet.  Almost felt like I was drinking a small bottle of Bath & Body Works peach lotion, but the alcohol in it helped it go down.

This is one of my favorite restaurants in Old Town. If you're a newbie to the Thai food scene, I'd suggest trying Malee's on for size.  Everything I've ever ordered on their menu is quite tasty - one of my faves is the Pad Thai.   Service is impeccable and always aims to please its patrons.   Love their intimate, outdoor patio also.  Lastly, love those long, tube-shaped candies as you exit. :)

Warm and cozy Italian dining experience!   Note: if you having a burning desire to dine here around 7-8pm ish, make a reservation. Or, be okay with waiting in the *tiniest* entrance ever. Or, suck it up and try your luck at open seating in bar area.   I lucked out and snagged a table for 2 in bar. Was loud, but comfortable.  I tried their Cannelloni, as I'm strung out on cheese, and they nailed it. Was rather large portion, so I took extra home and squeezed out another meal. Was great cold in the morning too!  Server was attentive and friendly - no issues there.  I went to use the restroom after eating and the Hostess barricaded herself in front of door. She asked me to use the restroom at neighboring restaurant as they had an "incident". I assumed this involved human fluid of some sort or plumbing issue, but I really had to go. The guy cleaning busted out with a mop and sweat on his brow, and I was able to squeeze in. I didn't ask any questions- it was better that way...  I'll be back for sure!

Coach House is one of my fave dive bars in East Valley. Why? Because I don't feel judged here, everyone is real and friendly, drinks are cheap, and there are happy, twinkling Christmas lights out everytime I go.  Please note that they aren't very big (inside or out on patio).  Plus, they're in close proximity to Pattie's (another great dive joint).

This place is remarkable to use for any type of imaging (ie ultrasound, etc) needs or requests by your PCP.  The check-in process is a breeze and the lobby is bright and comfortable. Scheduling was also seamless with clear instructions, etc.  Once called back, you are instructed to change into a robe (think spa robe w/tie) in changing area and are asked to store your clothing/personal items in locker w/key. Once you're in the 1st waiting area queue, you would go w/Technician to get your scanning done.  Once you complete all necessary imaging, you are asked to wait in a separate (2nd) waiting queue which is quiet and stocked w/great magazines. They have the entire process down to a science and works efficiently.  Staff was all very friendly and informative. Unfortunately, my imaging results weren't favorable so I will be going back for an additional extraction and test, but this really did meet my needs and I have confidence in their abilities and expertise.  Well done!

Tried them for the very first time yesterday afternoon.  Aside from not knowing that you paid the young kid standing outside w/your treats, I think I did okay. I ordered a single cheeseburger with all the fixin's and a small soda. Burger were pretty tasty! They could have gone a little lighter w/the mayo, but overall - not too shabby!  I've heard rave reviews on their tots as well - can't wait to try these puppies some other day. Oh, and all of their slushies and shakes.

Okay, so I didn't thoroughly research this nail place prior to going. I was also a rushed "walk-in" client.  I needed a redo of nail color and one small chip repair. I did get the service done, but the personnel just didn't seem "friendly" and happy to me. I felt that they were doing me a favor or something??  Yes, I tipped but not overly. I'm sorry - you gotta earn your tip and it's not assumed by just doing the flat minimum. Butt hurt bc you didn't get tipped to your standard? Pick a new non-customer facing profession! :)

Fantastic and quiet hotel right by Mayo Clinic!   My reason for staying wasn't related to Mayo Clinic, but I was stuck w/a horrible cold and my fabulous BF wanted me comfortable and pampered me better Florence Nightingale. #spoiled #romance  Spacious rooms with modern appliances/decor graced our room. Bedding was clean and comfortable also.  We had Bison Burgers for dinner (room service) as well as Egg Fritata and Breakfast Sandwich/Scrambled Eggs. Very good, for room service!!  Only suggestion wld be considering upgrading the coffee makers. They do make to single cup but the machine is UBER cheap and very lightweight. Makes the room smell like hot plastic.   Hotel is very quiet and clean. Very well done! Will be recommending to traveling visitors, or perhaps another sick staycation w/my man. :)

Great dive bar in Tempe! I'd be hitting this place up much more if I lived in SE valley.  Live music and games for all to play. I feel very comfortable here. Do not come here for a view, quiet ambience, etc. come here to rock out/drink, or do a Sunday Funday day drink here.  They aren't consistent with charging cover either. That's okay though - more generous tipping later! ;)

This place was cool - exterior is painted bright, sunshine yellow. Very cheery, yes, but the color doesn't seem to scream "Irish pub" to me - hmmm, I dunno... Inside was very charming - exposed brick and lots of wood - very pretty and "inviting". My date and I had the Irish Nachos - Yumm-meee!! Love the spuds they used too - reminded me of homemade spuds my gramma used to fry up for breakfast.  I had a Blue Moon and it was pretty delicious. They had a band which actually rocked - they played songs from Tracy Chapman, Tomy Petty, etc.  Good place to go - it does get crowded, so I recommend getting there sorta early to get a good spot.

Went here last Saturday night for dinner on a blind date and was impressed w/this little diamond in the rough! Be careful that you don't drive past it - their signage is not lit up at night and not very big and I flew right by it!   Yes, it's nothing too fancy/pretty, but the food is great and the customer service is fast and friendly. I had the cheese enchilada and beef tamale and couldn't finish it - it was pretty tasty! My date had the Shrimp Javier and said he always orders that and seemed content with the quality. We both had ice cold Pacificos and had a great evening.   I will definitely be back for more!

NOTE: This is a 4.5 star, not a 4. I wish Yelp would consider making more options for ratings, but I'll live for now...  This little cafe is tucked in an office building next to the Papago Spectrum building where I work. Obviously, the majority of their clientele is employees of the 2 office buildings, as well as Sonoran Quest Labs peeps, but I'm so happy they're in business.   Prices are a sliver too high in my book, but it doesn't stop me from doing business with them, because their food (sandwiches) are tasty and cashiers are very friendly!  Would I frequent this cafe if I didn't work in the Papago Spectrum? Ummm... probably not, but they seem to do just fine with office worker flow during the day.   Plus, I really like asking my coworkers, "Hey, are you going to the BUG today?". Ha ha!

Being a popular chain restaurant, these guys are decent. Granted, I only ordered shrimp/calamari combo w/fries. All deep fried too. Was pretty good but used a little too much breading for my liking (it shouldn't overpower the seafood).  Our server was energetic and engaged w/our table, I felt. Did frequent, but not pesty, check-ins.   Their "fun dance" time is a nice touch and I assume it's one of their trademarks. But. I do have misophonia (certain pitches and tones are painful and irritating to me), so this was triggered during a few of their interactive dance sessions. Just please turn the volume down and add more bass/less treble? For the love of God. Because I was triggered, I shoved even more fried goodness dipped in tartar sauce. It did work.   Although it's not Pacific NW seafood quality (due to geographical location), it is decent in Sonoran desert.

This type of shopping is not for the weak of heart - lots of people and elbows everywhere. I waited 20 minutes just to try on 2 shirts! Other days are better than others, but I always find something (even if it's just a pair of earrings). You can get Nordstrom brands for very little money - just be sure to check if there are stains, rips, etc. on your items b/c there are no returns. Lots of fun to spend hours here pawing through clothes - I do think the handbags are overpriced being as I've seen them w/broken handles, stains, etc.

Oh. My. God. Truly delicious food/drinks and super-fun atmosphere!  I went to the So. Central Phx location a couple of weeks ago after a long hike and was overjoyed to see such awesome decor and cool, ghetto-fab vibe. Tried the sangria (yum) and the frozen house margarita. Sooo huge and filling!  I had the Pork Pozole and was so damn good. Mmmm - I ordered the large size and had to take the rest home in a Dixie cup. It was so good that I got hungry again driving back to Fountain Hills so I drank the pozole from the cup en route. Sooo good!!!  Excellent service and quick turn-around of food/drink orders. Didn't disappoint me.

This restaurant is solid. Fair HH prices and exciting menu items.  Be mindful of going during peak dinner times; it can fill up fast with bodies. The lower-level bar is a single pick-up scene crawling with cougars/silver foxes waiting to pounce on younger prey doing sake bombs with their entourage donned in skinny jeans.  The sport of ppl putting in work to hopefully make some sweet love later, fully entertains me!! They should have popcorn, as this is better than any screenplay.  Oh, yeah - sushi quality is fab also. It is loud as holy hell though. If you're seeking romantic/quiet time with your lover, this ain't the place.

Seeking tropical excape in the oppresive Phoenix inferno? I'd suggest trying Tommy Bahama's.   Went here for first time yesterday for lunch w/a friend.   Decor was delightful - I felt like I was perhaps in Barbados again? *sigh* They used a lot of light colors as well as wicker/rattan (sp?) furniture, which worked well.   I tried their Steak Salad (yum) and Pineapple Jalapeno Mojito. They paired nicely together. The cocktail was refreshing and unique, served w/a sugar cane stir stick. NOTE: be weary of the pepper seeds shooting quickly up your straw!   Overall, it was a great experience! I only had the ask our server 1x to pls refill my water. But since I'm 1/2 camel, I couldn't fault the server.

Try their mocha Mindfreezers - great taste and is mind-numbing. Love their ample patio space as well. Customer service is always cheery and full of sunshine.   Bathroom was so dirty yesterday, however, that it looked similar to a gas station's. Blech! Not to be gross, but toilet needed to be "bleached down" and the door lock (it was a "onesie") needed to be fixed. I got caught w/my jeans around my ankles on the pot by a lady. I think she was more embarrased that I was! Also the bathroom sink was clogged.

I have been chomping at the bit to try this place!  It was packed last night (Friday), but it was Valentine's Day also.   First, it is a bitch to find. They do have a parking garage adjacent but there's not a lot of signage.   Loved their décor and how they have their back wall (bar area) showcasing their hard liquor. The lighting, choice of paint, seating are all done nicely and has a modern/hip feel.   The bathroom blew me away. I did miss the "hidden" door and had to seek help from wait staff to find secret door that had "SHE" at the bottom. Inside I found translucent stalls w/pink soft lighting. SOOOO cool looking! And, wait for it... 360-degree mirrors in your own stall!!! How sexy is that, ppl?!?   Anyways, I did order a cheeseburger and their ever-famous waffle fries. Burger was tasty (bun was a sliver dry) but waffle fries did disappoint me slightly. They came cold and hard - boooo!! Cmon guys - you are better than this! Mojito was DAMN fine - try it! Lots of good, muddled mint leaves - just how I like it!

My new spot for coffee/treats in my 'hood!! Can't believe it's taken almost 5 yrs to try them out.  Excellent view of park and fountain, sets MVCC above Starbucks locations, IMO. But, I really dug their genuine customer interaction/service, and options. I have only tried their hot cocoa bc it was around SuperBowl time and was FREEZING in AZ. It was truly delightful.  Plus, I almost feel like I'm in someone's kitchen when I go to sit down. Someone nice and wise. Like maybe my Gramma's kitchen. Love the feeling it gives me. I'm sold.

Tried these guys last Sunday for lunch and was quite impressed. Sat on the patio (in the shade) and my friend and I were immediately served.  Had the regular cheeseburger - RARE and sure enough, it came back pretty bloody. They listened to me. I wanted to hug our server. Their buns tasted homemade and taste was on-point (not too bread-y)...  Fries came in my very own tiny shopping cart - very whimsical. And, tasty.  These guys are the bomb - I'll be back.

I'm soo thankful to have the "G" be my first in tasting gelato yesterday! Besides the cute sexual innuendo, the place really is tight.  You can sample all you want of their wonderful flavors, and order various sizes of the Italian dessert. I just can't believe I've waited 38 years to try this?! Erin! It's LESS fattening than ice cream, but better/creamier?? I'm a changed woman.  I had the mint chocolate chip and was smitten w/my decision. And, they served it with a Pirouette?! Fab!

New fave! Situated right off of Camelback, you will find Chelsea's and her glory.  Hostesses and our server were superb. Service and smiles didn't stop.   I had their French Dip - probably one if the best in my life. No play. Their juicy roast beef and bread used is sooo scrumptious! Au jus wasn't too salty - full of flavor. And, their seasoned fries? They did right there too.  Patio is recommended over inside, IMO, because it can be pretty loud being that dining patrons can see/hear all of the chefs clanging nearby. It's fun to watch, but loud.

Went here the other night after work - fantastic Happy Hour menu! The grilled cheese sammy and tomato soup for $5 was spectacular! And, $3 Pomegranite Fizzes? Ummm, YUMMM!! Great service and retro/hipster ambience - I live in the area but would love to stay in one of their hotel rooms at some point. I will be back for sure!

Well all right, all right, all right...You guys are alllll right in my book! Every time I dine at either this location or one of your others, I have an overall great dining experience.  BTW, it is ALWAYS packed whenever I eat here - which I think is a great sign.   Lots of menu options also for the extreme vegan, vegetarian or straight-up carnivore, like myself. Can't go wrong w/their delightful Gyro.   Service is always helpful and attentive. Servers are always smiling and have a "pep in their step".  I don't know about you, but I thoroughly enjoy my meal AND am satisfied, but yet walk away with the "healthy and light" fullness that you don't get w/eating junk food. Very nice.

The thing I respect most about IKEA is the standardization. I mean, you KNOW what you're getting into when you enter through the royal blue/sunshine yellow doors:  -tiny pencils with paper and measuring tape -plastic totes (reused) for stashing treasures along the way -the teasing smell of Swedish meatballs with light cinnamon notes (cinnamon rolls). Somewhere in there comes an aroma of pressboard and cardboard boxes. -voices. Lots of them. From ppl of different heights and backgrounds. * Yes, they have a children's play area for entertainment purposes. -the huge, strategically-placed labyrinth that awaits ahead  Now, either you can become utterly overwhelmed and bust into a 180 and high-tail it back to your automobile in fear, OR you can embrace the IKEA culture and design and make the best of your experience. If you choose the latter, I suggest being in a fairly good mood and not be in a hurry. And, jazzed to decorate your dwelling, etc.  They always seem to have cutting-edge designs (think modern/contemporary) along with other styles in their furniture, bedding, textiles, lighting, etc. Since I love the modern look, I'm a fan.  Quality is so-so. Yes, their shit breaks sometimes. But they're cheap. I mean really cheap. I mean, what do you ppl want anyways? You know what you're getting into... right? Plus don't expect to carry out a fully-assembled piece of furniture. It's all needing assembly. But, look at the bright side - maybe you'll get more joy out of the furniture since your paws put it together??

Great sporting venue! Visited here this past Thursday for HAWKS vs. Cards game, and yes, but of course, SEATTLE WON!!! :)  Although, it's a long drive and on west side, it's easy to find and I love that I didn't have to pay for parking on game day. For non-season ticket holders, you have to park at Kellis HS and catch the shuttle to stadium. I was worried about this being a complete cluster-f**k, but it really wasn't. They had it pretty swift and organized - I was able to see kick-off due to their seamless shuttle!  I DO suggest better signage when leaving the venue to catch your bus back to HS/Brown Lot. I had to ask multiple workers and still got lost. I mean, just a metal rail way leading to busses (amid other tour busses), isn't completely clear to me. I'm sure I'm not the only one who was confused. I'm sure.

Not to shabby at all, Sauce!  Love their exposed brick, wood floors, and big chalkboard menu on wall. Adequate seating inside or out. Quick and friendly service.  Had the Feta and Turkey Salad (hold the corn!) last Sunday afternoon. Was pretty scrumptious! My dining partners had thin-crust pizza that looked delish also.  I will def be back for more Sauce!

Again, not crazy over chain restaurants - I mean, you REALLY have to have some major wow-factor for me to frequent your chain.  But, PF's is so boss. Really.  I have never had a bad meal here - ever.   Of course, their Lettuce Wraps are spectacular along w/their soups (Egg Drop or the Hot/Sour). Just tried their Pepper Steak last night - it won me over big time.  Their service is always top-ot-fhe-line as well.  Have a special event/celebration? Make sure you let the host/hostess know and they put a secret red paper in w/the servers notes so that your surprise dessert is kept on the down-low. Genius!

Olive & Ivy EQUALS utter bliss.   Highlights for Erin on Saturday evening:  1. Door immediately held open for me and a nice, warm welcome 2. Immediate seating (sans servervations) at Chef's Table - which held my attention quite nicely w/my adult onset ADD 3. Pleasant server who sincerely looked like she loved her job 4. Frequent check-ins without being a pestering fly 5. GREAT food (I had the chopped salad w/chicken) and smooth champs served in a gorgeous flute 6. Fab ppl watching 7. Packed restaurant, but acoustics worked well as I could still maintain a good volley of conversation w/my friend.

I've been here several times now and have had such great experiences. Great HH selection and their Pozole is to DIE for.   Great customer service and HOT, legendary bartenders. OoooEeeee!   I have never valet'd before - they offer it, yes, but I always turn total cheap-skate and bypass it. Save yourself a buck - go self-park across the street and do it right.

Great facility for Spring Training baseball games here! For me, I'll always be a homegrown WA-state girl and support the Seattle Mariners, and so family members and myself have been here several times since 2001.  Am I an avid, die-hard baseball fan? Oh gosh, no - I get wayyyy too restless and start squirming in my seat like a 3-year old. But I do love going about 1-2x/year and zone in and out of the game itself incorporating eating, visiting, walking around, etc in there too.  For me, it's the whole "experience" and a warm welcome into the spring season as nicer weather arrives. You can also catch fresh-cut grass smells and barbecued hotdog aromas floating in the air which tells my brain that spring is here which makes me SO happy!   I did give this complex a 4-star rating because I do wish there was better signage within the stadium for things such as smoking areas, exits, etc - I felt like I over-utilized the red-shirted volunteers for direction too much yesterday. Lastly, it took WAY too long to exit the bottle-neck parking lot after 9 innings were played, IMO. Add in more assistance with traffic control and partner with the city of Peoria for more time on the green light temporarily? Or, maybe I'm just impatient but it took 30 minutes to even move an inch to from our parking spot and that seemed excessive...

Went here for so SEAHAWK football last Sunday against the 49ers. So glad I did! This place was completely jam-packed w/Hawk fans - it was so much fun!  Service was impressive and TVs at every angle so that patrons wouldn't miss a single play.  Haven't tried any food but their Mirror Pond draft was tasty. I will be back for more!

So, for $16.50, you can get an oversized, leather reclining chair w/a side table and swivel tray over your lap, and fab view of the picture? I think it's money well spent. It's like flying first class - once you've got a taste of it, it's hard to go back to Coach. I felt like a true baller, I really did.  I do, however, wish AMC would consider bumping their OVERLY inflated meal/drink prices. I paid $4.50 for a Coke Zero? That hurt, it did. I didn't eat any food, but my friend's fries smelled heavenly.  Oh, and I wld also suggest better signage for parking. I got lost/trapped when parking at Gallagher Kennedy. I shrugged this off and found my way to AMC parking, but hit 2 dead ends in the garage by their loading dock. But, maybe that's just me.

So, I don't play music but my BF loves his drums and so guess who's going to Guitar Center, Sam Ash, etc etc? Dees one here!  I did peak in the piano music books and took a small trip down memory lane, remembering the Alfred series in my 3-yr stint as a stuggling pianist. The BF was crushing hard on an e-drum set (seriously, his eyes were bugging). I found a tin of Beatles guitar pics for my dad as a stashed stocking stuffer for Christmas marked $9.99 and I was charged $5.99! Score!  I also really appreciate the fact that Sam has live (blues) jam sessions on Tuesdays bc my father will be over in 2 shakes of a lamb's tail. Staff was cool and friendly!

I appreciate Costco because they're pretty standardized, tidy, and economical (duh). And, where better than in the good 'ole USA where we love to consume!!! Plus we're cheap bastards... All of us. It's true 'Merica.  I grew up on generic Costco brand (Kirkland) everything, and feel its still quality product. I bought pounds of frozen Mahi-Mahi filets that were around $15 but would have been twice that at Fry's. Damn, I'm winning at life!!  Plus, the hot spot sample kiosks are fun. All of the adorable retirees peddling their flavor of the days? Oh, and their Concession Stand (biting my knuckles)?!? Fab, quick food for pennies! Their chicken Caesar is pretty tasty! Coffee granita for a dollar-something is one of my faves also.  If you can bare the ppl with their KIDS everywhere and coughing out a lot of money (which is cheaper in the end per unit, do the math), then I say go full throttle. Watch out for that sun-scorched parking lot - it's quite a cluster!

NOTE: My review is solely based upon this Sally location.  I stopped here as part of my Christmas shopping as my mom wanted some new nail polish, and I knew Sally had decent prices and sales. They did offer a pretty large selection of brands and colors (including OPI and China Glaze) and even had a "Buy 2, Get Special Gift free" incentive going on. So, I picked out 2 OPIs in dusty pink and beige, and continued to browse the store.  Picked up 2-for-1 facial mask mud packs for stocking stuffers along the way, and then went to pay. The lady cashier didn't even acknowledge me. At all. Still stood there. Got impatient and noticed a male cashier in the store helping a customer and he seemed very friendly.   Left the rude lady cashier who was a mute, and checked out more stuff that caught my eye. Whatever - I'm not going to get pissy and stressed, it's the holidays. Male cashier went up front and I was finally ready to pay. He was very bubbly and rang me up. I asked about the "special gift" on the 2 OPIs, since he didn't mention anything. He apologetically tells me they're sold out and it was a gold/glittery clutch makeup bag. Okay - maybe you should consider putting up a sign w/this update? Or, taking down the freebie?   I watch the pricing on the register like a hawk and notice I was charged for each mud pack. I stop him and tell him about the 2:1 sign. He agrees and goes to correct it. At this point, I'm disappointed with this store - I shouldn't have to correct discounts of products, should I??? Sheesh.   I'll return to Sally at some point, but NOT this location.

Target truly does live up to its slogan, "Fast, Fun and Friendly". NOTE: I'm not sure if they still use this slogan, but did when I worked in management around 2003/2004.  As a former ETL of this retailer, it has been permanently engrained in me to "grade" each store upon entry involuntarily. This starts from the parking lot to when you purchase your items and exiting the store. This location is always "squeaky clean" and floors are shiny. Well-stocked and has good zoning. TIP: be sure to always check you BACK end caps for sales/clearance items!!!  Yes, they are always a tad more expensive than WalMart. I feel Target has more "class", ya feel me?   Plus, they have always won my heart w/the philanthropic efforts. Impressive!   Area of opportunity for this store: step up your game in the women's fitting room. Seems to be vacant a lot of the times w/a mound of go-backs parked and mounted at table.

Was on the mad-hunt for some Al Pastor meat the other night at the last minute (post work).  Once again, my trusty Yelp app came through in a clutch and delivered.  I called in advance to ensure they sold this type of meat, first of all, and they did. The shop is smaller but they do offer many products other than meats like detergent, Spanish-only CDs, Maria's Galletas, and pigs' feet.  I shimmied back to the meat counter and busted out my rusty Spanish and within seconds, 2lbs of the seasoned Al Pastor were in my grimy Gringa paws.  I insisted on using Spanish only when paying w/Cashier too. It felt great.  This is the first time buying this type of meat, so I have no baseline of if this was reasonable or not; I believe it was like $3 or $4/lb?? I dunno... But it made some great burritos later.

Try the Hot and Sour soup (especially if you're stuffed up from allergies) - lots of egg and tofu. Love their spices.  Also had chicken chow mien. Tasty, but noodles were a tad overdone.  They may consider redecorating their dining area. Very plain, hole-in-the-wall and that may scare guests away.

Fresh produce? Check Short lines? Check Friendly (but non-ass kissing) Service? Check Clean, well-lit store? Check  So far so good, right? But, I must say this - ALL non-working, soccer moms in their camel-toe yoga outfits: please, PLEASE do not encourage all of your children to get a lil "Mini-Me" shopping cart and take up valuable space in the damn joint! Okay? No, they're not cute - they are in our way. All of the TJ stores I've been in are pretty small and crowded without this added nuisance.   And another thing - you would think that ppl who shop healthy/organic/Vegan/blah-blah blah would have some sort of zen-vibe, right? Well, why is it that almost every time I shop there, there's some ass who is a road rager out in the stressful parking lot? Hmmm? Namaste.  Other than that - no complaints! Great store.

Horrible experience - very disappointing! I tried this place last Saturday for the first time and won't be going back for more.  The lady (I think she was Russian) who gave me a pedicure was rude (told me that my choice of polish color) won't look good. She was also rough and smeared my toe (on my sandal). I had to call her attention to fix the smear - she appeared pretty lazy.  So, I did not tip that day - I always tip for good/great service but not that day. Plus, I thought they were overpriced.

** UPDATE (5/17/13): Tried them out again after the owner (Mya) wrote me and was very impressed.  Their salon is very soothing and has a definite "royal" feel. Soft lavender walls w/crown molding, and 3 rustic chandeliers grace their ceiling. Nice, soft Muzak in the background. Beautiful black-and-white chairs w/dark purple pillows at their nail stations. Awesome pedi chairs - black leather, massaging, and each chair has its own PURPLE iPad. Yes, I said every chair has it's own iPad to surf, work, etc.   Very clean and meticulous which is pretty important to me. I noticed they also use a new plastic liner in between each spa pedi. Love this!  Customer service is stellar also - very friendly and attentive! Offered me (and others) small bottle of water.  They have done a complete 180 from 2 years ago (under different owners). I'm a fan!!

Liking these guys/gals alright! I've been solely a GNC consumer, but decided to give VS a try. Staff at this location asked me if I needed any help within 3 min of me wandering aimlessly for my Braggs vinegar.  Clean, well-stocked store, helpful and friendly associates, as well as fair prices.

Very decent place for some Vietnamese fare! I've probably been here around 5-6 times now and everytime (regardless of day or time), it's busy.  I always get the Spring rolls, Egg rolls and the Seafood Pho - yes, I know this isn't very adventurous, but I'm happy w/these items. Alwlays friendly service in a relaxed environment.  Wish they would be a little more generous with the condiments - or maybe I'm just a freak who likes a lot of sprouts, cilantro, lime juice/jalapenos in their Pho? Mmmm...  All in all - def worth checking out!

Didn't gamble here as I'm tight about kissing my money away and... didn't want to get lung cancer from the heavy 2nd hand smoke. And, I was worried about this as I was sitting in non-smoking section the entire hour! STAFF: please invest in better ventilation - you are killing ppl and making them smell bad!!  Yes, other reviews are pretty spot-on: aged, heavy smoke, etc. Overall, I felt pretty depressed and stinky in there.  Their sashimi at their Sushi bar was fresh and delicious though, I must say! Had Seafood Soup and it was probably a 2/5. Lacked solid seasoning and seafood was rather rubbery.  I showered when I got home. Not trying to be a jerk, just giving you #rawtruth. :)

Total hole-in-the-wall, dive Chinese restaurant in a strip mall in Mesa. But it's totally effing awesome!!  Treated my parents here this evening and was so worth it! Yes, there are poorly photographed pics of some of their dishes on the walls. Yes, it's pretty loud and a couple of flies buzzing around. And, yes, every table is packed with toddlers screaming.  But, I promise you that   1. Will have tasty, authentic dishes 2. Will have an extremely low bill ($32 for three of us w butt-loads of leftovers??)  All I have to say is: this is my new go-to spot for authentic Chinese now. It's worth the long drive from F.Hills to Mesa!

I specifically wanted to purchase from this dealership as they have been the recipient of the sought-after Presidential Award for years now (customer service), and there's a reason behind it.  To start with, I have a strong hatred for car shopping. Strong. Not so much looking and testing cars, but sales agents. Yes, I know they're making a living also, but they're notoriously agressive and not genuine in my past experience.   I worked with Adam and he was not too pushy in the least and made me feel like I was the most important person there. He relentlessly pulled inventory around to the front for me to inspect and bombard w/questions. Not the slightest impatience when I looked at one car for maybe 20 seconds and wasn't interested. Brewed my mom and I real Colombian coffee he brought back from his trip recently. It was extraodinary, BTW.  Adam was informative and helpful! We also worked at the end of my purchase with Mitchell who was great as well and took such time to explain the car and check-out process. Mitchell has such patience as he synced my iPhone with the Bluetooth and sat through Voice Recognition training! Talk about great service and going above and beyond!   The dealership is very tidy and bathrooms have flat-screen TVs, as well as Service Department have a cafe (they serve comp continental breakfast) and have a zen area on 2nd floor with massage chairs! This adds to the experience once you have your car, and continue to feel so special, in my eyes.  I'm so happy I bought my new car here - job well done!!

This is my NEW nail place that I plan to stay loyal in regards to my hands/feet needs!!   It is a pretty big salon - love that they have a nice Lobby where you can sign in and THEN a second room that has walls of polish colors/brands (elaborate selection) and couches/plasma TV to watch, H2O in fridge and restrooms. NOTE: Am I the only one who goes to the restroom before mani/pedi time? For me, I want to turn the phone off, not have to pee, etc. - complete relaxation!!   To the left, they have nice, big pedi stations and a menu of "options". Yes, they can get pricey, but so far, they have proven to me the stellar services.  To the right, they have nail stations - very relaxing place, in general, w/friendly nail technicians. Keep up the great work!

Had knee reconstruction for torn ACL and meniscus this past Wednesday, 1/8/14.  This facility doesn't feel like a hospital at all; it is very calm and crisp from the moment you set foot inside.  The entire process (beginning from registration paperwork to discharge) was seamless and very well orchestrated. All staff members were very comforting and helpful along the way.  The facility is located right on Shea (off of 101), which is literally down the road from my house in Fountain Hills.  I did a Pre-op pregnancy test and accidentally spilled pee-pee everywhere. With my cheeks on fire from embarrassment, I began ripping out paper towels to cover my boo-boo. One of the RNs told me, "That's all right baby - it's just a little pee-pee". Sooo nice!  They have these paper smock Warmers that connect to ur robe if you're cold. Since I was freezing, I partook and it was heavenly!!  My anesthesiologist came back and gave me my leg block. Not the most comforting thing, but it was sorta trippy to not feel my R leg.  Next thing I know, I'm waking up in Recovery and comforted by a nurse. Leg hurt like hell and I was offered morphine and apple juice on ice. Nice.

Great place to get your hair did!!  I have been going to David Wallace for over a year now and have been quite impressed w/his magical hands. I think his prices are very fair and he is pretty precise and "Type A" when it comes to looking like a rockstar! Plus, he's very witty and we have great conversations.  Loved the fact that he also uses sulphite-free shampoo/conditioner for post-color treated hair.  It's also a good/reassuring sign when I strike up convo's w/his other clients and they have long-standing tenure w/David - that speaks volumes, IMO.  ** Text/call him w/plenty of notice - he fills quickly!

Want to see an alleged haunted house from 1885 that ghosts at night warn the living, "Get out"?  Want to see wreaths made of braided/woven human hair from 19th century?  Try your luck in panning for gold flakes/nuggets?  How about having a staff member fart in your face while helping him hang an old hand saw??  If any of these remotely appeal to you, then head on up (or down) to Anthem's Pioneer History Museum! Price is steep, but get a Groupon. Oh, and go visit their pumpkin farm!

Am I tight w/my money? Yes. Yes, I am at times. Where do I go to stretch my money the most? Dollar Tree.  Why? Because everything is $1.00. But, you do have to be smart too. I've seen name brand hand soap in there for $1, but have seen this same brand at WalMart for 87 cents. So, I do believe that there is some trickery going on here.  I can buy 24-count Tylenol PM (well, generic Canadian stuff) here as well as Christmas wrapping paper, bows, nametags, etc. All for one dollar, folks. I would have probably paid double if not triple at Target or Walmart for this sort of stuff.  Some of their shelf-stable food scares me a little. I see lots of dented/bent stuff made in China that has labels in . Just be careful as you may end up w/a case of botulism.

LOVE you guys - I have been to MANY locations within AZ and CA and have always experienced consistent encounter w/taste of drinks/set up, etc.  I almost prefer your powdered flavors over the standard, coffee shop "liquid syrups". Can't get enough of the vanilla - so delish.  Pastries/snacks seem to always be fresh and tasty.  Ok, strange - but, I even love the shape of your ice! I prefer itty-bitty "pebbles" of ice over ice cubes/chunks.   And... I"m a big fan of the color purple and adore that you have purple straws. :)  If I had one wish???  It would be GRAND if you all would consider expanding more and adding more locations - especially in the NE Scottsdale, AZ area (hint, hint...). Ha ha!

Another grreeeaatttt spot for HH in downtown Phx area! First and foremost, this place truly is challenging to find; I drove by and still second-guessed myself in the back parking lot that the sign read "Switch" at the top of bldg.!  Once you do find it, I think you'll be pleased. Ambience is hip-cat and lots of blue lighting/blue accessories - very nice!  I had the black-n-blue berry Italian Soda off of their HH drink menu for $4! So refreshing! You'll find it garnished w/a fat blackberry on top of cocktail w/a nice blueberry layer resting at the bottom for a nice treat after you wet your whistle! Thumbs up here!  I tried their Hummus/Pita app and LOVED it! Great job!  Plus, my 2 coworkers were quite happy when I checked in on Yelp last night and scored us $10 off total bill of $50 or more. So, by dining here, I think I helped my career as well. Ha ha!

Went here on a Thursday evening JUST in the nick of time to snag a Mojito at special HH pricing! So glad I went w/this choice - quite possibly it was THE best Mojito yet. Not too sugary-sweet and very generous w/their leafy mint leaves that I could stab/muddle w/my straw. They have that recipe down to a science, I decided.  Okay so I ordered another couple, despite being after 6pm HH deadline. I don't regret it. It was worth it. ;)  Ordered the spicy Calamari - soooo delish! Tried a few of the edamame - again, quite possibly the best I've ever tried!   Service was on top of their game as well. Gorgeous/zen-like resort. Even fell in love with their complementary lotion in the bathroom. Valet personnel were all gems. May need to book a Staycation there STAT! Great job, Sanctuary.

Thought I'd pump out an update to my original review almost 3 years ago... Stopped by (via Drive-Thru) around 11am in efforts to beat the lunch crowds and it worked. Yes, I was still a little full from my bagel this morning, but I only had to sit and wait 5-7 minutes...  Again, same menu items since 1948 (I think?) and relatively cheap. I like that they don't "sell out" and add on trending foods or even package their burgers/fries into combo's - they keep it all OG and it works for them.  Not a huge huge fan of their fries but I still jam them down my face. Friendly and fast service always, which is refreshing to me.  Only thing w/In-N-Out that is like a tiny insect crawling in my ear is the "JOHN 3:16" stamp on the bottom of their drink cups. Obviously, this is a religious verse but it just bugs me, you know? I'm not a Satanist who drinks goat's blood and bursts into flames on seeing any Christian references, but I just don't want it on my food products. I dunno - it's hard to explain I guess. I wonder if this ever poses issue within their employees who don't *happen* to be Christian?? I could honestly debate this all day... But just like the fries, it doesn't deter me from business and cramming down their burgers. :)

You HAVE to try this place!!  So sooo good! Pot stickers are a must!  Maybe it's because it was sorta cold and windy plus we were very tired from dancing all night, but their food was outstanding! Plus, I was among good friends/company and we ate a la family style. So, I guess my review is a bit biased due to other factors.  I dunno - food was delish and warm. Kind of like a warm, nurturing hug after wild nights tearing up Vegas. Such greatness.

I have used The Parking Spot for about 8 years now in both Los Angeles and Phoenix areas. They are a little spendier, but not so bad once you join their "club" and utilize coupons in airline magazines.  I always feel secure parking my car here and courtesy shuttle vans are on top of their game.  Love that they have complementary water and newspapers for their clients! Also love that you can't miss their bright yellow and black spotted vans to hail down when you're dog-tired from your flights. Great job!

Went here several Sundays ago for a brunch. Gotta say, LOVE love LOVE all of the decor! Think Latin American culture crossed w/gothic shit (i.e. colorful skulls and masks), plus it's before Halloween/Day of the Dead, soo you can see eery blood stained-stickers on the tequila posters in the bathroom. Love that touch!  I ordered the Hangover Burrito (even though I didn't have one). Was not disappointed! It weighed about 2.5 lbs (I swear) and looked like a toddler's leg. I pumped 3 solid meals out of the fried piece of heaven. Had everything AND MORE stuffed inside.  Service was ehhhhh. Maybe the gal was new, but just kind of felt she was bothered by our table and sort of "sneery" tude/vibe coming from her. Dunno but I still gave her decent tip.  Will be back for more fried goodness. Soon.

Pretty typical Motel 6: room doors open to street, thin walls, sliver of soap in shower, polyester bed spreads covered in DNA, old school-fat-butt TVs, druggies/skanks roaming around in all their shady glory, and DICKHEAD security who cop attitude when a guest (moi) asks to be rescued from the locked pool area at 5am-ish. Seriously. You're just an un-armed security guy working part-time for minimum wage - get over yourself.  Motel is cheap and great location - mall is next door and so close to Old Town for night action.

Tried this Italian place for last-minute lunch yesterday.  NOTE: Try to avoid around 12pm noon, M-F, due to lunch rush, but this is already common sense...  Had pesto pasta w/their Penne alla Vodka, very good flavors! But, it is sitting in steam pans, so don't expect "freshly made pasta either". Their homemade rolls are so tasty - almost seems like there's some rosemary in the bread? Well, whatever it is - I enjoyed.   I'm surprised w/all of the lowered star reviews! The lady who helped me was very friendly and I had no customer service issues at all. Prices are on the higher side, but I just atribute that to being downtown, I guess.

Discovered this dark sports den about 2 weeks ago, as they have a PING PONG TABLE! I just learned to actually play the game semi-respectably and after buying new paddle at Big 5, I was dying to show off my new moves.  The table is in fair to good condition but the green net needs a "lift" as it was pretty droopy, but that only helped my amateur status. My man and I volleyed for a good hour to hour and a half and ordered HH apps which were surprisingly tasty! We ordered the egg rolls, wings, and Mac-N-Cheese. All were winner-winners and we consumed every last crumb. Believe they were priced at $5/per app during HH hours.  Service was attentive and friendly. Ventilation was sub-par and I highly suspect the temp by ping-pong table was flirting with 80 degrees. But then again, I take my new sport very seriously and was moving quite a bit...

Bravo, Saddle Ranch, bravvooo!!!  Went here for dinner on 3.17.13. It was pretty crowded (as it was delightfully warm and a holiday), but our 3-person party was seated within a couple of minutes. We were seated on the patio and it was perfect! Good place to people watch too.  Service was friendly and prompt. We all ended up w/some sort of burger (get the "Original" - soooo heavenly!). I did end up taking some of my burger (due to large volume) home w/me. They have a nice recipe for their hamburgers. And, they got my order right - bloody rare! Yay!  And, the best part?? Free green apple cotton candy for dessert at our table? I love it! It was a bit sweet for my liking but I did enjoy poking holes in our spun sugar "torch". You guys are great! I'll be back for sure. You have won my heart!  ** NOTE: It would be awesome to include baby/wet wipes while being served the cotton candy at the end - that way you're not walking away w/a sticky mess of hands. ;)

I've been to this location twice now and was quite impressed. Not only do they have a nice atmosphere (plus patio) for dining, but quality sushi.  Their sashimi cuts are nice and generous which is something that really stands out to me. Rainbow roll was superb and Philly was delish also. NOTE: I'd prefer mine w/a little less cream cheese, as it starts to overpower the salmon.  I've dined at the Kabuki in Woodland Hills, CA also and had an impressive experience.  Great job Kabuki - you have won me over!

Great location! Can't go wrong w/Fresh & Easy - it truly does live up to its name.   Don't forget to skim over their "clearance" section if you're okay w/use/freeze by same day. Pretty good deals!  LOVE their dried, unsweetened mango pieces. Such a great snack!

Oh Geisha - why are you so GOOD to me?!? Yes, you are a bit pricey but who can resist HH specials for 7 days/week? Very lovely.  Sushi always comes out promptly and tasty. Excellent/friendly service always. Sake and beer just pairs so beautifully w/everything.  Love the decor here - great job. Love the Morrison/Hendrix/Vicious posters. Love the rock in the middle of the room. And, the best feature, the toilets in the ladies room. They have controls on the wall for cleansing options and everything is by sensor. Someday, I too will have such a sophisticated toilet.  Love you Geisha!!

This is one of my FAVE dive spots! It is pretty primitive and tons of tacky decor, old Christmas lights and CHEAP drinks! Watch out - they are strong too.  This is a good "starting off platform" in Old Town before venturing out to bigger venues.  Be prepared for the TRUE dive experience of having cigarette smoke attached to your clothing and hair as well as older bar flies buzzing around trying to put in work.   Bartenders are all peaches, too.

I have never visited a NY & Co store before. Well, today, I did and I'm glad because their prices were fair and quality seemed to be there with their clothing.  I didn't spend too much time in there (I was on a quick lunch break), but managed to find a thin, sleeveless sweater, high heels to match, and beaded bracelets/hoop earrings, for a grad party tonight after work. #procrastination  I hit discounts on all four pieces and paid $85 (w/tax), because they worked w/my jeans. Not too shabby...  Customer service interaction could be dialed up - I did several walks around the store and wasn't approached once to see if I needed help. The store wasn't busy either. I'll be back in a few weeks to sniff around further.

Went here today for lunch and it EXCEEDED my expectations! We had egg rolls and spring rolls to start and they were perfect! I ordered #22 and was totally blown away by it. Not only did the food taste wonderful, but the chefs have excellent presentation of their dishes. This is one of my top 3 restaurants now of all time.  The atmosphere is modern and sort of "zen-like" - they did a great job with colors, lighting, etc. Love the wall waterfall too!  I will go back here again and again and will be sure to take out-of-town guests here. Love it!

I've missed this place because it's sort of "set back away" from Shea Rd, IMO. Or, maybe I drive fast and just blur by it.  I'm glad I stopped last night to try them out. Granted, it was take-out, but I was lusting for some Pad Thai. They do a nice one - excellent/vibrant flavors and generous chunks of moist chicken and shrimp.   Tried Chicken Lo Mein as well. Noodles were of good quality and nice and firm. Flavors worked well and ample chicken pieces.  I wish Take-Out orders would be handled by Hostess or other, in lieu of Bartender at very busy bar. I felt like sort of a tool and "in the way" standing by ppl seated at bar w/not a seat free.  Not a huge deal though. :)  *NOTE: Parking is viciously competetive around 5-7pm on weekday evening, if you're cheap like me and don't valet. LOL

This gas station is "okay" but only at "last resort" situations.   Why? Well, because:  1. the neighborhood itself is questionable/shady (i.e. bars on windows, graffiti, trash blowing like tumbleweed, etc.  2. it's located by onramp of 202 freeway. I believe more robberies occur at gas stations/banks located nearest to highways or freeways (for quick get-away)  3. it's not very clean. Think lots of dust/grime.  4. inflated prices  Why did I give Sinclair 2 stars and not 1? Because of the cute green dinosaur on the sign. He's so cute, I couldn't resist.

LOVE this place! Stayed here April 2012 and the rooms are gorgeous! Love all of the contemporary touches and clean lines of the rooms.  Our room had amazing view of the strip.  Lobby is very cool also. I noticed the elevator's robot voice sounds like a very aged, uptight Brit lady. Everytime she said "Going down" in a condescending manner (like she didn't approve of our partying), my whole party would just burst out laughing at her. Ahh, good times...  Plus, my friends and I went out to Rain (before it's closure) and made it safely home.  Highly recommend this hotel!

Great venue for a low-key, sports environment. They offer lots of beer on draft as well as bottled choices.  Try their potato skins w/fat kid's ketchup (i.e Ranch) - you won't be disappointed. Made me a tad bloated the next day, but still tasty and sinful.  Service was excellent - very friendly servers w/frequent check-ins.

Yet another marvelous Thai restaurant found within the East Valley! My parents, aunt and myself feasted here on Valentine's Day for Linner.   We ordered:  -Chicken Lo Mein -Kung Pao Chicken -Rad Nar with Pork -Chicken with Mixed Vegetables   Skipped the Appetizers as we all concurred that while tasty, they take up valuable 'real estate' in our bellies as well as detract from our main dishes. I was bummed that they didn't have any Thai or Vietnamese coffee, but in all honesty, I had no business with any caffeine this late in the day.   Prices were pretty low (our bill was about $7 per person) and everyone came home with leftovers to devour later that night.   Dining room is clean and serves its purpose - nothing amazing or too special. Service was friendly and fast.

I'm currently not into any craft or hobby that would drive me to the Hobby Lobby, but I did visit them earlier today to shop for large matting and frame for a group photo taken for Employee Appreciation Day at my jobby-job. Oh, and I'm championing the event at our local site (biting knuckles with anxiety), so everything MUST be perfect. I'm not kidding.  It was SUCH a pain-free shopping experience, let me tell you. First off, this store is pretty huge with lots of stuff (think candles, homegoods, crafting shit/supplies, that sorta stuff). I instinctively head to the back of the store for the custom frame area. My gut was right and they were located in the back along with many rows of matting, various frames, posterboard, art, etc. I selected the matting I liked, but needed a custom one cut for a unique size. Plus, the matting is to be signed with Sharpies by employees, so I needed ample room too. The male employee was very helpful and answered all of my ignorant questions patiently. It took him *maybe* 3-4 minutes total to cut my dimensions request and reassure me the extra-fine point Sharpies shouldn't bleed on this material.   I also picked out a basic black frame for my picture - they do have more ornate designs too.  I visited cashier lady next and presented my 40% off coupon and I was on my way back to work! Every last-minute shopping trip should be more like this one.

Need your 09 or older ride checked for smog emission? Live in northern East Valley? This is your place, folks!  Guys (sorry, not being sexist - didn't see any female EEs) that work here are friendly and quick-moving. This I love as I don't wish to spend too much time here or at MVD, post office, dentist, u get the picture, right?!  Great jobby-job!

This Keg was A-OK. Was here during early part of December to help celebrate a colleague's 40th birthday.  Drinks were well-made (how could you mess up a Grey Goose and Diet Coke?) as well as the apps (nachos and bruschetta). I didn't eat dinner, but birthday girl had a well-done steak and it smelled/looked fab.  All in all - great place to dine and eat/drink! I'm just not a huge fan of chains - it makes me squirm a bit. Bathrooms were pretty modern/oversized and just a nice place to powder your nose.

Dined here for first time this afternoon.  JK really does have all of the true components of a dive sushi place:  *Pictures of various sushi (from the mid-80s) gracing the pressboard walls *One wall being unfinished raw lumber (maybe they're replacing the fake walls?) *Plastic flowers with copious amounts of dust in the women's (onesie) restroom  *Sushi pencils attached to plastic spoon? Do ppl really steal these? *Vinyl seats  It works for them. Cheap prices and great-tasting sushi. Avocados were a little overripe and lifeless. One of the rolls seemed kind of sloppy, but overall - great experience!   Loved the fact that the sushi chef himself came over and asked us how we were. Also thought it was sweet that the owner and his family were doing their Sunday family meal w one big rice cooker at their table! Very nice!  If you're looking for glitz and glam - it ain't gonna be here. This place is no frills and I'm a fan.

Went here for lunch today and liked it!  Very contemporary, sleek restaurant/lounge. Loved their S-shaped chaise loungers as well as their marble(?) slab tables. Their customer service was very "on point" and my chopped salad w/steak was phenom! Steak was a sliver on the dry side, but well flavored. And, why oh why this restaurant doesn't have chicken is an utter enigma to me! LOL  I'd love to come back for perhaps a dinner/drink. You have a new patron, Hanny's!

I've *never* had a bad experience here! Huge Kona fan.  Especially love their Happy Hour price points (1/2 off) of their rad apps/sushi rolls. Some recommended items would be:  Spinach Artichoke Dip (served w/tortilla chips) Spicy Tuna Roll Calamari w/the Aoli (sp?) sauce Lettuce Wraps Potstickers  Service is swift and accommodating always. Patio dining makes for good people-watching (esp after 9pm on weekends).   Their music choice is GREAT at this location, to BTW. #happyeater

I'm blessed and feel fortunate to have this restaurant within walking distance from my new job (as there aren't very many food places around).  Lunch crowd gets thick around 12-1:30pm ish, but they also have patio seating (w/bumbershoots) outside in front. And, they do carry-outs also.  I highly recommend the Italian (cold) sandwich. Superb!! Fresh meat and veggies used and *the perfect* amount of spices/seasonings. Blows Subway Italian sammys out of the water.   Price-points are fair and I've never seen any of the servers/cashiers with frown. Friendly interaction and no mean-spirited trash-talk among cashiers during down-times, which I always seem to notice at other places like this one.   It is very pro-University of Arizona also.

This venue is SO much fun this time of year (Nov-Jan), as you feel that your literally in some remote log cabin in a snowy place far away. They even have a FAKE, blazing fire on a big screen TV w/a nice wood frame.  It was especially fun last weekend as SO many Santas et al were out due to Santarchy. Really got me in the holiday mood - well, plus I was wearing my boots w/da furrrrrrr!  Great spot.

Love this Marshalls! Yes, it's a chain and you can find similar brands elsewhere, but this particular location is consistently clean and well-stocked, IMO. Plus I'm a devout shoe-whore and they have an expansive shoe section.   This past Saturday, I happened to stumble upon some cute Nikes on clearance for $29. I did notice that this was marked on the sample only and not my size in the box. I was already mentally prepared to be shot down as the price seemed a little too good to be true. I was thinking someone was trying to mess by planting red stickers everywhere, but still worth a shot.  I was ready to plead my case to the female Cashier. She listened to my story and went back to check the model. Long story made short, it was by accident. But she did speak w/the floor manager and gave me the exception. That is great customer service and I will definitely continue to shop at this location.

Wish to party like a total, crazy Rock Star? Desire to feast your eyes on some beautiful ppl partying in a world-class, upscale club? How about dropping $10k on the Ono cocktail?  XS has this and more. I promise. Okay, so I'd never drop that kind of money on something you'd pee out 10 minutes later. Even if I DID make millions, I just wouldn't bc of the shear principle.  I was lucky enough to be w/some folks w/a little cheese and DID get to experience bottle service at our very own table. It did truly rock, I must say.  This club is so hedonistic, I just love it. Music is on-point and sound system is perfect. I've been here 3 times and I'd go back. Did see Kanye West here in 2010. Not a fan of him as a person but do like some of his music.   HINT: Get on the guest list - don't wait in line. :)

So, gots to say, I do have a bias for this venue. Why you may ask? Well, because they are PRO-SEATTLE SEAHAWKS, and I've been a very loyal Hawks fan since birth (being from WA). Ok, we did lose against Oakland (scowl) but it's still *preseason*. Yeah, I'm still a little bummed... Booo! :(  Went here last night for first time and was quite impressed. It's actually rather large w/plenty of tables and a 360 degree bar seating. Lots of TVs to watch your team's game too. Additionally, they offer outside seating for the cooler months which is always a nice bonus.  I didn't eat here yet, but I did sample my date's Chopped Salad (sans raisins) and it was Nom-Nom! I probably would have used less dressing as I don't like it "too drenched" but AJ did it up just right. I especially liked that they have chosen to add Quinoa (which I adore) as well as Pepitas. Oh, get this?! They offer Ivar's clam chowder!!! (squealing and biting fist). Yes, anyone from the PacNW knows that Ivar's is the shiz and they offer it there. I will be sure to try this next time and budget appropriately for the calories. ;)  Had their Pyramid Hefeweizen (bottle) and a cpl of Snapshot drafts by Belgium Brewing. Soooo good! But, any beer pairs nicely w/football, right?  Service was on-point as well. Frequent check-ins from our adorable bartenders as well as smiles from all staffers.  Women's restrooms were very tidy and well-stocked. Love that they offer many stalls as women take forever at times to do their business and primp.  AJ, I will be back for you. Much love!

Our company has ordered cakes from here for milestones, birthdays, etc.  I've never tried any type of "bundt" cake before that time, but my interest was piqued because it was attached to the word "cake".  Ever since my first bite of the UTTER HEAVEN, I've been trying to chase that "first high" ever since. I could be easily hooked and strung out on these, if I permitted my squealing inner-fat kid to get her way. To keep myself in check, I just enjoy them through company events, as it's better this way.

Save your $$ and don't valet - huge self-parking lot to the east!  Love this venue - it seems to always be packed, which is a good sign. They had a live band on Friday night which was fun. Seating/tables are scarce - I suggest coming a little early - or make friends w/ppl who already have a table.  Drinks are a bit pricy, IMO. I mean $36 for a dbl Gray Goose/Cran and Cosmo?? Plus I threw in $3 for a tip - that's $40!!!! Jeez  Bathrooms are also clean - this is very important to me. They may want to think about getting better signage for restrooms - maybe it's just me, but I felt it was a small treasure hunt finding the place.

**Don't eat here - just don't do it!!  Took my mom and auntie here for Mother's Day brunch and fully regreted my choice.  For $20/person, I expected decent quality food - even at buffet standards. No, they really missed it here.  I tried:  *Snow Crab: okay but overcooked/rubbery. Fresh seafood in the desert is tough, in their defense. *3 sushi rolls: worst sushi ever! Tasted like it was made previous day. Rice was bordering on being a little crunchy. Didn't finish. *Seafood Pasta salad: decent, but a LOT of mayonaise. *Soft-serve chocolate ice cream: great! But it's made from pre-made mix, so not too tough to mess up this one.   It was nice that they offered complementary champaigne, but again - $20??   Plus the overly-saturated second hand smoke is just disgusting. Plus, a small bug ran across the table. I felt SO dirty and will never be returning.

Postino's on Central was the shiz today. I fell in love. Hard.  Ordered:  1) Butcher's Block - an assorted block of cheese, salami, olives, bread... Blew me away w the quality.   2) Lox on Bruchetta - for $3.75 and amazing, amazing taste. How could one NOT order this one?!?  3) Mimosa bucket for $30 - okay so I didn't bogart the bucket and I did share w/girls, but OMG!!!!!!  Percentage that I will return? Baby, you had me wrapped around your finger w/your comp valet service.

Delizioso! Love Sapori D'Italia - and even more so because I can support local businesses in Fountain Hills.  I've been here several times since moving in 2010, and most recently, about 4 weeks ago. I see they have redone their dining room - such a nice, inviting change. Love the color scheme. Feel like I'm sitting in a family member's dining room.   I'm a bit of a creature of habit and always seem to order their calzones. Why? Because it works for me and meets my needs. That's why. I feel like I have a 10-pound brick in belly post-consumption, but that's my choice. This only happens when I'm craving Italian/heavy foods.   Noise level in dining room is up there, just because it isn't a huge space either. Plus my ears are a tad sensitive.  I dig their fire torch outside of their entrance too -love how it looks at night. Fancy-schmancy!  Can't wait to go back.

My love affair with the iconic windmill Dutch Bros is escalating and getting intense.   Don't get me wrong, love my Starbucks and Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf... But. Dutch is just...different. Their coffee (in general) isn't as acidic as Starbucks, but still bold enough to demand respect.Drink variations are creative and unique to them.   Further, I cherish going there for coffee because every last Barista has this genuine "happy, buzzing vibe" that is contagious, and I can't help but smile and want to hug them. For real. The more I noted this consistent pattern behavior (at various locations, mind you...), my curiosity thirst had to be quenched, so I visited their website. I then saw they had their very own "Dutch Creed", which pledges optimism and just "lovin' life" as their true culture! It all made sense after I read this... It made me love and respect them even more actually, because it's obvious employees DO have buy-in of this creed and practice it. That's just a beautiful thing to me. :)  But, I'm afraid I'm not the only one who adores Dutch, as they have obscene lines in both their drive-thru AND walk-up window. *Sigh*. But, after a little internal dialogue (i.e. cost/benefit analysis), I endure the painful wait because it's SO worth it.  Dutch Bros - I *heart* you!!!! #superfan

I went here last night for a business dinner and was quite impressed. Our table had the Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant appetizer as well as the assorted Bruschetta Quattro - YUM!!  We were also treated like royalty, I might add, by the staff. Of course, it probably didn't hurt that one of my new co-workers used to work with the General Manager! LOL  For dinner, I ordered the Citrus Chicken w/Shrimp Scampi and Orzo. Wowwee wow! Tasty - went well with our bottles of White Oak Chardonnay.   I didn't have any dessert (I'm trying to lose 7 lbs), but did try my new director's Creme Brulee and it was HEAVEN in a dish!

I personally think all of the popular Fro-Yo places are pretty similar (i.e. Yogurtini, Pinkberry, etc.).  But, strolling in here yesterday afternoon after gorging on a big brunch surely brough a smile to my face!  Love the tile work/decor of this store, as well as the full length wall offering self-serve yogurt. Some flavors more exotic than others (pistacio). I went w/my go-to flavor of Dbl Chocolate. Toppings looked fresh and bountiful. I didn't want to get too crazy w/gummy worms, Captain Crunch, etc, so I simply selected granola oats and Oreo. Soooo good and decadent!  As w/other places, you pay by the ounce (or pounds! LOL). Fair enough, right?  I know their outside space is limited, but little disappointed that they only offer 2 outside patio tables.

Ok so I didn't get the actual fried chicken w/the waffle touching my plate. BUT, did get 2 pieces of the fried chicken. Superb - one of my new, guilty pleasures. NOTE: Wiped a good portion of my crusty hangover away too.  Service was stellar also - came on a Sunday and they were packed!   Very warm/comforting dining experience! Felt welcome here and like I was sitting in my gramma's kitchen. Left Lo-Lo's feelin' fat-n-sassy!

This definitely takes the cake w pho in the valley, IMO. Took my dad here last Sunday night and ppl were waiting for a table by front door.  If you're seeking a quiet place for ambience, you prob shouldn't come here. It's sort of down-n-dirty but I think it works for them!  Not in the best of neighborhoods either, but don't let that scare you away. There's an Asian massage parlor next door. Do I know if they give happy endings? No, I don't, but you may want to inquire within after you stuff your gullet with steaming pho. Be prepped to get the fuzz called after you bust a move after your body shampoo.  Fresh accoutrement served with your soup and cheap prices!! We had 2 seafood soups, 2 apps, and 2 Diet Cokes. Bill was under $20. My kinda establishment.

Went here for lunch today and was quite impressed! I read all of the favorable reviews on here (of course) and I will definitely return. We had the Greek Fries and they were uber-garlicky but yummy (a tad on the salty side). I had the Spanakopita (or I like to pronounce "Spank-A-Pita") with rice, veggies and roasted potatoes. It was pretty tasty! My friends and I sat out on the patio and it happened to be a sunny day, so it was a great lunch. Plus, you can't beat the low prices - very reasonable!

Shoe Carnival... Don't let the name fool you - you won't see cotton candy being spun onto paper cones, the sound of cheap, tiny balloons being speared with darts exploding in defeat, or tired Ferris Wheels with burned out bulbs illuminate the night sky... BUT. You will see tons of shoes for sale.  The day of my visit was especially intoxicating as they were having a Buy 1, Get 2nd Pair for 1/2 off for a majority of their boots!! And, they had very nice boots on display! Prices are okay, but this is coming from someone who doesn't want to pay a dime for anything. They did have a pretty ample clearance section that I did score some flat sandals with the cutest fringe for $10. They will be showcased in Spring 2016 - yes, they will!  I liked the fact that they had plenty of different mirrors angled for anxious buyers to sashay around the store for a preview. They also had a good assortment of casual sandals, athletic shoes, heels, and boots for women.   I'll certainly be back!

LOVE this place! And, best of all, it's in my own town of F.Hills!  Tried the recommended Pollo Fundido and was not let down. They used a very generous amount of chicken and was nicely made. Chicken was stringy and moist - perfectly done!  Had 2 House (frozen) margaritas - sooo delicious! NOTE: I had a HORRIBLE hangover on Sunday from 2, yes 2, margs. Not to be snotty (well, I am a liquor snob, I guess), but they use Sauza tequila in their mix. No bueno. I had such a horrid headache that felt like I had 8 drinks.  In the warmer months, enjoy patio seating in the back w/their relaxing fountain! Love that they have so much greenery around their patio.

What a great dining experience! They have very unique drink selections for starters - I had the Acai Mojito and it was luscious! My date had the Purple Haze beer (New Orleans) and enjoyed as well. We started off w/drinks and then ordered the soft pretzels w/cheese dip - yummmy! We both ordered the Shaved Prime Rib sandwich and were pretty blown away w/the taste - superb! Too full for dessert - perhaps next time? Our waiter (can't remember his name) was awesome was very speedy, answered all of our questions and took our picture from his new iPhone and texted it as a souvenir. :) Don't bother w/valet either - just park your car yourself in the garage for free.

Located several blocks south of the true and loud "entertainment district" of Old Town on Main St.   I'm in love w/their décor - love all of the exposed brick, wood and lovely chandeliers! Service is always friendly to boot. Prices are a tad on the high side - haven't tried their food yet.  Demographics are wide range of ages - I truly like this! I don't feel out-of-place being in my 30's and feel like I'm back in college w/everyone doing keg stands and body shots. ;)

This is pretty much my "oh-shit-I'm-outta-gas-n-about-to-get-on-the-101 last chance stop".  Always sparkling clean AND has a pungent smell of bleach as I open the glass doors - morning or night. I love that. It says to me that employees are constantly wiping, mopping, and sanitizing and that rocks in my book. Gas stations have a lot of traffic of people - both dirty and clean, which requires maintenance of floors, counters, etc. So, great job!!  Cashiers are always friendly w/me - which I also adore. Something that DOES get under my skin? The male cashier who works early mornings. Why? Because I'm not a morning person - never have been. I will speak as necessary but do not wish to have a full conversation at 6:30am on a Tues en route to work. And, please Sir, don't pester me on "Why did I select this flavor coffee?" and ask me 20million questions about why the sky is blue, and ask me to smile. It really is irritating to me. Really. Nothing personal, I just don't do early mornings is all. :)  He also works Saturday mornings. Sir: please don't swoop in and give your unsolicited opinion about which crappy gas station sunglasses I should buy according to my hair color and skin tone. Ok? I just need a shitty $10 pair to block the rays, these aren't Ray-Bans. Leave me in peace.  Overall, great place to grab coffee and gas up!

3 snaps in a Z-Formation!!   Hope you got my early-90's In Living Color reference there... Well, if you're too young/old or just plain lame and didn't watch the show back in the day, it translates to them being awesome!!!   Above AND beyond customer service, as well as very fair pricing and great communication efforts. Wes was fabulous to work with!

I have only been here once but had such a fun time! It's a rather spacious venue offering live music. Plus room to dance? Love it.  Went with a girlfriend who knows a large group of bartenders, promoters, etc, so didn't pay for a drop that night.  Bad part of the night? Losing my iPhone and the staff (one person) seemed a little bothered that I asked them to check as they were closing.   I did a follow up call and email the following day to see if my vital appendage had been turned in. Mgt was very speedy and polite.

First time here earlier today. I have VSP insurance and in need of new glasses. I wanted to find something close to me here in town or N Scottsdale, and am very happy I tried 20/20.  Amber helped me find shapes of frames which was flattering for my face type by trying a lot of samples within the store. She also dug some more to try in her office. When that wasn't as fruitful (I'm very picky), she browsed online for me! I had a few that she found online and she has ordered samples to try in 2 days.  I will be sticking w/them due to the extra help, as I had my mind made that I would try Costco, etc.  That, to me, is great customer service and a great experience for me.

Woke up so hungry this morning that I thought I would start biting my right hand. Didn't want McDonald's, BK, Jack... I wanted a true Mexican breakfast burrito.  Once I have a foodie vision in my head, I'm locked in and make it an unwavering attempt to meet my goal.  I order the Sausage/Egg/Cheese Burrito. Excited, I hand the Cashier (drive-thru) my debit card. He disappears for what seems like a prolonged time to just swipe my card. I don't mean to be paranoid, but being a past victim of someone stealing my bank info and going crazy in Montreal, CAN, made me this way. He comes back w/ear-to-ear grin. I'm suspicious as how can someone be THAT giddy so early? Maybe he just is. Happy pills? Chronic? I dunno... I think I just think too much.  Back to the food - I race to my place of work and am DYING to bust the seam on my burrito log. Honestly, the sausage crumbles tasted old and a little dry. Cheese grease was seeping everywhere. On a positive note, love their red (spicy) sauce and the verde (tomatillo) sauce. My tummy is pissed and it feels like WW3 going on inside. I'm throwing the rest away.   May return but for lunch or dinner fare. May not.

I really don't like giving such low stars on Yelp, but I also want to give honest feedback to businesses so that they're able to change the less than desireable behavior AND warn my other fellow Yelpers. I've been through the drive-thru at this location 2x now. First time was less than favorable, but I wanted to give them 1 more chance to shine...   On Sunday, 1/27/12 at approx 10am, that didn't happen unfortunately.  Okay, it all starts w/the interaction at the speaker when one orders their goodies, right? Well, even if you can't see the person's face, it is still crucial to be polite/helpful with the customer. Please don't be sarcastic/snarky to me if I ask a simple question about hours of breakfast.  Second point of interaction - at first window. I was digging for exact change in my purse, but is that any reason to yell at your coworker in the back, "I'm waiting on her - jeez, chill out!" and then to roll your eyes and say to me (customer) "it's like we're an old married couple". Very unprofessional.  Third point of interaction - delivery of food/drink. This went okay, but I ordered a vanilla iced coffee. What I rec'd was vanilla-flavored milk sans any coffee. Not cool.  Had to park my car, go inside and explain situation to cashier. Maybe I was extra annoyed because I was a tad hungover and really needed that caffeine boost? Plus, I wasn't showered and in sweats, etc - I really had NO business being in public which is why I did the drive-thru option in the first place!! The Manager seemed surprised at my story and almost didn't "believe me". Really dude? I don't have better things to do than invent and concoct this story??  After his thorough examination of the coffee-less beverage, he personally made me a new one. He then gave a nice apology. Perfect - that's all I needed...  Moral of the story? Just get it right the first time, okay??

Why oh WHY did I even come back here last Saturday night? Well, self, because you quite frankly had major munchies and needed salty food bc of your vodka consumption. That's why.  I do, however, regret consuming food at this McD's location - even in my drunken haze.  My Filet-O-Fish (towards the end) had a long (about 3") white hair in the tartar sauce. I started gagging and spit out the burger and the rest.  Never again. Never!!!!

Yes, Party City, you lost 3 whole stars because you didn't have my order of 3 balloon bouquets ready (as promised) this morning at 9:30am. Apparently, a male employee by the name of "Sebastian" failed to work this order and a female employee (didn't catch her name), didn't see my order (which was not completed).  Sooo... my coworker and I stood there for 10-15min for them to blow up balloons. They were able to lasso about 5-6 employees for extra manpower and got the job done and balloons did look fabulous, and ultimately did pull it off.  But. It freaked my shit out when I have an event at my job that *I* am leading and a PC employee tells me around 9:37am that the order wasn't ready and no one got it done. Not cool, but nice recovery guys. :)

Let me introduce you to my new hair salon!! Not only are they local business (which I always love to support), but they do a damn, fine job.  Going to a new salon is very scary for me, you see, because it's a total crap shoot on your personal results. Plus, I'm protective of my long hair. But long hair was badly damaged and needing to be cut off (I estimated a good 3").   My nerves were calmed when my mom told me she was very happy w/her color and cuts. And, according to Yelp, all reviewers gave 5/5 stars, which gave them significant credibility for me.  Since I wanted color/cut, I had to first secure an appointment for just a "consultation". The impulsive/impatient side of me didn't like this, but then the mature Erin took over and told my inner child to STFU and "Let's do it the right way". Inner child's voice was quieted and I slowly realized that this salon took their time with assessing clients' hair and what their goals were, and if they could pull it off even.   My consultation took about 15 minutes with Anita. She listened to me, studied my pictures of styles I liked/color I wanted to try, while running her fingers through my damaged hair (#uttereuphoria). NOTE: Come prepared with pictures and be ready to articulate in exactly what you want!  Since I wanted my base color done, cut, and Balayage color, I had 2 more appointments booked for later on. Yes, this seems labor-intensive, but I like that they take their time and respect other clients' time.   Went Saturday for base color (think warm chocolate color) and cut. Anita was professional and talked me through all steps and why she was doing something. After color was set, a young male shampooed my hair in another room and I turned into submissive, wet noodle who had tingles and was sliding down in her chair. Amazing!! No water running down face nor water in ears here.   Salon isn't too big, but is nicely decorated and offers product for sale, as well as self-service Keurig or infused-water (lemon and cucumber). Oh, and tiny chocolates and cookies. Wide array of magazines available also to help with their clients' boredom. Basically, it's upscale, but not pretentious and stuffy.  This salon certainly displayed it's 5/5 star reviews through my interactions and observations - snazzy job!

Staff that works early morning 6a-7:30a shift, M-F, are all FANTASTIC! I am always greeted w/a genuine, warm smile by whoever happens to be cashiering. Their drinks are always made consistently good too!  *Side Note Personal Pet Peeve: The family-on-vacation donned in shorts or the retirees (also in shorts) who take their sweet-ass time at 6:45am ordering their drinks/baked goods in front of me in line. They do a lot of squinting at the menu, hemming and hawing over choices, scratching their heads, stepping back, etc. NEWSFLASH: There are working ppl who are on a time crunch for their commute - step aside if ordering is too much for you! Thank you. :)

Doctor's office not open on a weekend? This IS your place for you to stop by if you need immediate med attention - stat.  Clean, cheap (if you're insured) and comprehensive.  NOTE: Book an appointment online and complete your pre-forms ahead of time. Trust me. ;)

Ordered the Carne Asada Burrito this past Friday evening. It was divine!! Especially liked the fact they didn't skimp on the protein. Way to go!   I did utilize their drive-thru services and so I can't comment on the inside décor, etc.  Neighborhood, however, is less than desirable being located on VanBuren. VanBuren Street in the Valley of the Sun does pride itself w/being the "pay for play" street. ;)  This is yet another dangerous temptation I face on my route home now. *sigh*. Can't wait to try another menu item! :)

Tired of your chain coffee joints? In the Desert Ridge vicinity? Well then I suggest you high-tail your ass over to Matador.  Totally awesome decor and bitchin' coffee. Friendly and COOL baristas.  Yeah, just go. GET SOME!!!

Love this place!  Went yesterday with a friend and had a great burger experience. I noticed a definite "50's vibe" going on when we were greeted by a friendly worker behind the cash register.  Unique burger options and love the fact that their "toppings" don't cost anything extra. Had the single cheeseburger sans onions and Cajun fries - very fresh and tasty!  Was surprised they didn't have ranch dressing or cook-to-order meat (they only grilled medium well).  Big fan of their soda machines! Literally had SO many options such as PowerAde (and Zero) with raspberry, grape, etc etc. You could even order Sprite with grape! Huge accolades there.  Food impressed me as well as the set-up and cheery service. Great job!

Main attraction/star player in Fountain Hills here, Yelpers. Obviously, one can assume by the name that there is a "park" and also a "fountain" in store when they visit for the first time.  The fountain does erupt like Old Faithful at timed intervals (every hour?) and is pretty cool and makes our town unique. Please take extra precaution on windy days, as fountain spray WILL blow on pedestrians on the sidewalk. Also note that a lot of ducks reside in the water... ;)  The park is well-maintained with tons of grass (which is rare in AZ) as well as a few businesses at the south end. It is canine-friendly which makes my heart happy and I'm sure puppies feel that going here is a huge social affair in their doggy world. The park also has a mini amphitheater on NW corner for outdoor concerts/speakers, etc which is rad and was pretty well-planned.  They also have a kids water play park thing-y in SE corner for them to frolick and splash around. And, they even have a memorial area (not sure for what - sorry!) on the east side too.   So, this park is pretty much "the tits" and I'm rather proud of it being in our town. I've gone here to walk solo when I needed some fresh air/exercise, vent with girlfriends about men and flap our gums about other girlie stuff, have been on dates here (both were crappy), attended Norooz (Persian New Year) and had picnic w/my Persian bestie and her family, and just... people watched sitting on a bench!

Very happy w/my new gym - great location (just off of Shea Blvd and FLW Blvd), friendly staff, good assortment of equipment, spacious, CLEAN, and decent pricing.  Membership does cost extra if you want to go the VIP route (personal towel service) - I opted to save my $ - I can worry about my own damn towel. ;)  Very nice to have extra supplies in women's locker room (i.e. hairdryers to use, lotion/soap, and mouthwash). Don't know about the men's...  I don't have kiddles, but for those of you who do - there is onsite daycare in the gym, PLUS one channel dedicated to seeing the recorded (real time) playroom on the CardioTheaters on the cardio equipment. Nice, right? TAlso, each cardio equip has their own TV monitor - so nice!!  Offer an in-house juice/snack bar. Have only purchased a PowerAde from there, but am tempted to buy a smoothie or protein shake at some point.  Also has huge theater room next to locker room in case a member is bored (I guess?) and needs to kill time.   Has boxing ring - so cool! OH, and adjacent studios for cycling classes and other gym sessions.

Tried this club on for size this past Saturday. The comics were pretty funny - loved the Headliner, Tom Segura! Felt bad for the comics during the show though - couple of times throughout the night drinks fell and splashed everywhere, a lady fell, and this belligerent, highly-intoxicated ass in the back slithers out and slurs, "I'm gonnehh throw thomething at youuuuu", and some hecklers. :(  Drink prices are a bit steep, but what else do you expect in Old Town 'Dale?   The owner seemed very nice and cool, and made sure everyone was taken care of throughout the night.  Large group of peeps from the show sashayed down a couple doors to the Western for some honky-tonk. Good times!

I'm purely a fan because it's literally like 3-4 blocks from my work location, so I can pick up quick stuff during my lunch break.   Last time I was here, the cashier helped me a lot w/the self-service machine when he really didn't have to. He even scrapped old gum (embarassing!) from my CVS Rewards card on my keychain so it worked!  Only complaint? It's carpeted and sorta smells like wet dog.

If you want a REAL wrap, then I suggest you eat here.   I am enamored of the quality/freshness of ingredients they use in their wraps, as well as the generous amounts of more expensive (protein and cheese, etc.). The care of the "craftsmanship" of their food products is just uncanny. I feel like I'm getting a massage and a kiss when I eat their food.  The vibe is cool and comfortable. I don't feel like anyone wld be snarky or snub me here. Another "safe place".  Service is always on-point and genuine. Five stars.

Cheap and GOOD coffee! It's a nice switch-up from Starbucks for me. Try the K-cups - that way you can bust out some DD-grade from your home-based Keurig.  Donuts are boss too. Try the non-PC named "Munchkins" - that way you can pop the whole sucker in your mouth at once! Red Velvet... mmmmm...  Plus a drive-thru? I thought it was rather sick that AZ had drive-thru liquor and cig places, but drive-thru for donuts?!? Talk about being a lazy-ass fatty! Okay, I've done it before 1x (shhhh). But in my defense, I was in a hurry AND it was hot outside. ;)

I like it here! Good location (for me) at FLW Blvd/Via Linda and CHEAP!  I've gone to Lacey a few times now and she's great! She truly listens to me and communicates effectively (crucial in getting the haircut you want).  The salon is in a strip-mall and has that Fantastic Sam's/Super Cuts feel to it (so don't go if you're seeking a luxurious day salon-type ambience). I got a haircut (about 7" cut off), deep conditioning treatment and blow/style for $35.  I also loved the fact that they were very accommodating to let me come back (I wasn't 100% happy w/my new cut) the very next day and get some more length cut off - no charge and with a huge smile.

One of my favorite places to hang out (or let my hair down and hit the dance floor)!  It's always pretty packed here (depending on time of day) and service has always been excellent everytime I go there. Love the firehall decor theme - and the stand-up martial arts dummy by the entrance. I have a strange tradition of hitting this dummy in the head everytime I go to FH.  Especially great place if there's a game on - since they have TVs mounted from every angle of the place.   Only gripe I really have is pricing. $10 for a Bloody Mary?!? I haven't tried any of the food here yet, so don't have any feedback on that...  Keep up the great work!

Have been going to Dr. Abby Roberts for 2 years now and she's fab!!  Town Center Medical is very clean and has an adjacent parking garage to avoid hot car after your business. Location is pretty centralized and located in Old Town.  **TIP: Don't take the slow-ass elevator. Take the stairs - it's healthier for you anyways...

To me, the Sandbar at Desert Ridge is like a beloved, worn-out pair of shoes that stink to high heaven, that you would never dream of tossing out. It is uber chill and you don't have to rock out 6" red bottoms to feel like royalty here. Go ahead - wear your flip flops and wife beater - you won't be judged/snubbed - I promise.  Love their HH selections and tacos. And who wouldn't love some sand and tiny splash pool in the middle of the Sonoran desert? I know I do.  Does it get kinda grimy and overcrowded? Absolutely. Do you sometimes get inconsistent quotes on drink specials from various staff at times? Sure. But with all the bad comes the good, right?  I feel comfortable here. It is one of my "safe places".

Oh, JJ's. Where do I even begin?  Well, to start painting the picture here, I really (I mean really) hyped you up to my beloved BF yesterday afternoon. Crazy raved about your bread quality and taste, over-generous portions of meats, and loved that you pushed the envelope by offering taboo alfalfa sprouts.  My rep was on the line, as BF pulled into this location to treat me to dinner last night. Your location has a neon sign that says "Free Smells", right? I was rather giddy to showcase this, but alas, this location literally smelled like a post "dropping the kids off at the pool" type of situation. Not exaggerating here, or trying to be mean. It did, Jimmy John's. :(  Okay, so ordered our sammy's, and I wanted the jalapeno chips as they weren't out on display. The cashier fetches them from behind counter. No prob, but wouldn't you think that proper inventory zoning wld catch this? But what do I know?  Sammy's are ready but are tiny. Tiny. Here I was gushing about how high these magical sammys would be and they were THIN. Hardly any meat like they were around 2010 or 2011. And NO effing sprouts?! JJ - I ordered the #4, which is turkey with alfalfa sprouts!! I went back and requested these be put on, but I should not have had to do this. Right?   My BF and I bought sodas also. Why, oh why, are your straws and lids at top of soda dispensing machine? It's counter-intuitive, IMO. Why no napkins?? We had to WAIT until mayo was smeared on our paws and lips to visit counter again for them to cough up friggn napkins?  My BF wasn't impressed w/bread either. Granted, he's VERY biased and spoiled as he just relocated from San Francisco and has had easy access to scrumptious sourdough, but still...I believe our total bill was around $16 or $17. Very high and not cool.  Sounds like JJ's is penny-pinching the overhead which is ultimately causing a poor customer experience. Tres disappointing, I must say. Will not be back.

Perhaps it was the setting, dark and muggy night. Light breeze kicking up small palm fronds which danced along the sidewalk. Not sure if we felt like having something "heavy" so late at night (8:30p) but could entertain something light.   Female servers (didn't catch names) greeted us w/warm smiles under the semi-eclectic décor and soft lighting. SOLD!  Ordered the Lo Santo salad w/chicken and Toronja (w/Grapefruit Jarritos soda) Margarita. Mmmmm! Delicioso!! Dining partner ordered their Garbanzo/spinach soup w/bread - tasted his and blew me away!  Go and eat here. Just go.

My fur-siblings, Rocky and Penny, visited Talk To The Paw, about a week ago. Those 2 fluff-balls have visited a LOT of groomers around the valley since relocating from WA state 1.5 years ago. Although I haven't been a paying patron of this establishment, I do feel obligated to submit a review on behalf of my canine bro/sister. :)  My mom stated she gave the Groomer explicit instructions on how to trim their hair and some sensitive hot-spot areas that upset little-fry, Rocky.  Rocky came back with an ear-to-ear grin and was happy! No rolling around for days or fixation on any spots.  I think we've got ourselves a winner here...

**NOTE: I give U/O a 4.5 not 4, for the record.  You know something, I've NEVER visited an Urban location but have always been intrigued due to the rumour mill of unique gifts, OAK clothing, etc. So very glad I trapsed over today during my lunch hour.  Very easy to browse and intuitive sections, yes. Prices?? Ehhh... well, they're on the high side. But, I'm a cheap ass. I almost bought a vintage RUN-DMC tee, but $28?! Come on. I wouldn't feel right wearing it... Does that make sense?  Made my way from 2nd floor (after accepting that RUN wouldn't be coming home w/me) to 3rd floor. SALE leaped out at me and I bee-lined for the left corner. Bought a "Shit to Do" notepad on clearance which is whimsical and makes me smile, and flower-infused lip gloss. Was in a penny-pinching mood so I bypassed the Lena Dunham hard-bound book on clearance for $9.99. Gee whiz- I'll just go to the library I guess...  Cashier on first floor was very friendly and genuine. Love that they have a mesh black/white bag as I can (and WILL) reuse the SOB. Love to you Urban

Great place! Good change from Starbucks of Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, I must say.   Plus, how can you beat a foam-milk design of hearts or an angel on your favorite, hot beverage?! Such a nice touch.   Only con for me would be absence of restrooms, but I have noticed that this is a common theme in Scottsdale Quarter establishments.   Love the fact that they have oversized, leather chairs w/smaller tables as well as the high bistro tables w/high stools.

Great and classy place!! Located on 2nd floor of Sdale Quarter (adjacent to iPic). NOTE: park in the garage by Brio, or valet - I believe Tanzy validates parking.  I had heard rave reviews of Tanzy, but had my own personal bias w/the name. You see, I was raised on a farm in SW Washington and "tansy" was a menacing weed that was cursed under one's breath in the spring. I personally thought the weed was quite charming (beautiful, yellow flowers)...but my grandparents thought differently.  Tanzy didn't disappoint! It was late afternoon so the staff rolled back the walls and the lounge area was completely al fresco. Nice breeze on the tropical sofas while watching the tops of the palms sway in the wind. Felt like I was on a damn vacation.  I had a cucumber-lime martini (delish, but a tad on sweet side) and their calamari. OMG! Soooo good! My friend had their fries and they were quite impressive also - unique tasting and love that they were put in like a little, silver "fry basket". Nice touch!!  Service was impeccable and attentive. Tanzy, you won my heart and have changed up my personal bias - thank you!!

I just recently was introduced to Charming Charlie as of last year. In the female fashion world, accessories are extremely crucial and CC is a superb resource.  This particular location is most intriguing as it's 2 levels (gasp!). My colleague and I had the habit of running down here during our lunch break and pawing through all of their treasures (especially the clearance section on Level 2 in the back corner).   The entire store is also color organized. What is so special about that, you ask? Well, let's say you are needing to buy a turquoise blue, beaded necklace for a special event. Boom - just head towards the blue section - done!  NOTE: Sign up for their e-newsletter for even MORE discounts!  All of their associates are cheerful as well as offer assistance.   CC is like a lusty temptress. I cld literally spend hundreds in this store.

Had dinner here last Saturday night w/a girlfriend. We were seated almost immediately (outside - brrrr, under heat lamps). Yes, it was SUPER chilly that night, but you do get toasted under their nice lamps - plus, you can ppl watch while you dine on the patio - one of my favorite hobbies!  Server's name was Josh and he was very attentive and friendly. Great personality!  I ordered a lighter fare of Hummus and Pita which was excellent! I had a Blue Moon and I tell you what - hit the spot!  I do believe it's "pet friendly" as there was a very friendly Chocolate Lab dining w/his master one table over. :)  My friend had the baked (or was it broiled?) chicken and reported it was tasty as well. She ordered tea, and Josh literally came out w/a black "stash box" for her selection.   Great vibe, great food - I'll be back for more, fo sho!

I've been going to this location for 2 years now and pretty satisfied. All of my exams are done very thoroughly and I never feel rushed.  They have quite extensive options for contact lens wearers - especially around Halloween time! Want to look like a cat, devil or zombie? Check 'em out!  Only constructive feedback is when you are promised a follow-up call, please follow through on this and actually make the call. I've had this happen a number of times. When I've tried asking about this, it's a bunch of finger-pointing at "the other Receptionist". Tsk tsk...

Again, it really does pain me to give low stars but my experience there was quite terrible.  NOTE: I tried Katana several times in 2010 (when I first moved here) and wanted to see if they were new-and-improved in 2013. For me, they've gotten worse.  I was craving sushi one night so I called for take-out of salmon sashimi, Philly roll and Rainbow roll. The girl who took my order (Brittany) said it would be ready in 25 min. Okay - great! See you then!  I gave them 30 minutes (just in case they were slammed). Showed up and Brittany seemed a little flustered and kept apologizing that my order wasn't ready and made a quick phone call. Okayyy. Mind you - no one is sitting in the dining area. No one.  After 5 or 10 min, a couple of patrons came in and were seated. Still not ready.  More time elapsed and the sushi chef (don't know his name) came through the main entrance w/a box of food. Thought I caught a glimpse of cucumber and perhaps other veggies. More time elapsed.  Chef apologized to me and said "5 more minutes" - I nodded and smiled. Finally order came out (WAYYYY over-priced too).  After about an hour wait (total), the sushi was quite disgusting - I must say. Way too salty and it just tasted "warm" in some wierd way. Salmon sashimi was pretty decent - good cuts and okay quality. That was the only thing I finished.  Will not be returning here in the near future - but, I still have hopes for this place to turn itself around.

Found another great stop for fro-yo! Zoyo hit the spot on a 3-digit summer day in Phoenix. I had the chocolate fudge yogurt and was quite impressed as it didn't have that tangy tart that others often do.  Toppings were well-stocked w/expansive options. Housekeeping of the topping station was also on-point which goes along way for me.  Shop offered tables in/out for patrons. Temp inside the shop felt like a meat locker, but maybe it was bc it was so hot outside?

LOVE this place! The decor alone is so cool - kind of "Dia de los muertos" meets Compton, Cali! Love the metal bike and Virgen de Guadalupe at the door - nice touch! Margaritas are tasty and it's been wall-to-wall people every time I've been there. I will go back again. Oh and be sure to go back to the chalkboard - they have oodles of custom shots w/hilarious names. ;)

I love it here - I really do!  Definitely a fan of the bar/restaurant/outside pool concept. Especially during our brutally hot summers here in the valley.  I like their inside area - I feel like I'm almost in a cave of sorts - very cool. Outside is great too - very glam (w/their chaise lounges/sofas/pillows in cabanas)! Wish there was a wee bit more room to meander around the pool - always feels like someone is inches away from falling in pool.  Service is always quite friendly and prompt too. Good drinks and I've only had appetizers here (typical bar food). ;)

This venue works for me as it contains:  -Unique "cottage" type feel dining environment. During cooler months, you can dine al fresco under some shade trees/bushes, and then seperate dining "rooms" inside. Low ceilings w/antique-ey brick-a-brack/tchotchkes adourned on walls. Feel like I'm back eating in my Gramma Esther's kitchen. Ahhhhh :)  -Elborate menu choices at a nice number. I tend to get overwhelmed if menu offers too much.   -Friendly service. Warm smiles were everywhere and frequent check-ins.  -Quality food. I tried Pesto Shrimp Salad and was satisfied; however, they could have upped the pesto on mine as it was a tad skimpy. Had a bite of the Mushroom Tart and it was DAMN good. Desserts looked tasty as well.  Areas of opportunity:  -Housekeeping. Big chunks of food found as I pulled my chair out to sit. That's just gross. It wld be very quick and easy to do a light sweeping as patrons left, IMO, being that they have wood floors.  -Follow through. Had to remind our Server 3x to split our bill 3 ways. Also, never did get my lemon wedges for my chemical-tasting water. Booo!

Went here last night for Aries Spears show and was quite impressed! Very nice set-up venue in downtown Phoenix. Of course, I sat at the front so had a perfect view of the comics the entire time.   Cocktails were a tad weak, but the kick-ass fries made up for it!  Aries was soooo hysterical - he killed it! He's one of my new faves. :)  I'll will be back, SUL, for sure!

In the remote Fountain Hills vicinity? Love to eat red meat in a rootin'-tootin' Western type joint? Enjoy live music?  Yes? Well, then I suggest you high-tail it down to this local honky tonk watering hole.  Steaks are by far the must-have of the menu. Their chili is killer too.  Service is very friendly and patient. Oh, and check out the bar stools along the bar. They are leather saddles - very nice touch.

I don't feel FULLY at liberty to make a full Yelp-worthy review for Mint as I was highly intoxicated on Saturday night, but I will do my best.  We met ppl here who did have bottle service, so no lines to wait (plus for me and my braced up knee!). Music was cool and had good systems.   Pretentious? Absolutely. Great for ppl watching? Most def.   Service there was great, IMO. Just not my crowd, is all. :)

I went here on a double date as we all wanted to listen to live music in a lounge environment and Kazimierz's had a long line winding from it's front doors, and we just weren't havin' that nonsense.  The venue is pretty dark and sultry, but sexy. On this particular Saturday night, there was a Jazz musician and he was GOOD! But, it shouldn't have been so loud because of the smaller space, Jazz genre, and being a lounge... you want to converse without shouting/lip-reading, right? Sigh. Maybe I have aging dog ears, but some notes he hit truly pained me, causing me to utterly wince, and this isn't a pleasant experience. But he was talented and had passion!  We only stayed for 1 round of drinks and decided that due to the noise level, we would relocate to a quieter place to eat and shoot the shit. While we were there, menu items/drinks looked appealing and service was friendly and quick. ** NOTE: I liked that they fully considered how dark their venue is and made their menus automatically illuminate so you can read food/drink selections. Cool touch! I'd definitely try this venue again!

Went here for first time in Oct 2013 and had a fantastic time!  Attended through a Meetup.com event so it was a fun group. We were reserved for a Sunday (I believe?) morning and had muffins/scones, and oodles of wine/champs. Everything was laid out perfectly - down to easels, canvas, assorted brushes, and pallet w/a buffett of colors to snag.  The instructor has a headpiece on so her voice is amplified the entire time throughout the studio - genius! She's leading us very carefully and treating us like the mere amateurs we are. Also fab! On this particular day, we were to produce a bowl of Autumn harvest veggies. Not a super-great choice, but I was still super-stoked! The instructor was great - she was very clear and even got off of her little stage and walked through the room in interactive way guiding and praising where needed. NOTE: She LOVED my carrots. ;) The alcohol helps, not only is it fun, but it lowered my inhibitions thus made better art. Makes sense, right?  Then, it was over and everyone took group pictures. It was sooo much fun!  I will be back - BB! This time, I'm taking my mama to try.

Took the love of my life (male cat, Sebastian) here the other day for wellness exam and routine shots.  Very friendly staff, clean clinic (looks like human one to me), and complimentary beverages to humans in Lobby and treats for your canine/feline. Awesome job!  The assistant and Vet did a very thorough exam of my boy and communicated what they were doing and why to his human. Love that.   Prices are pretty decent ($20-30) per vaccination.   Other cute note, they took many pics of Sebastian for their database. His cute little face now graces my invoices! Makes it easier to shell out $ seeing his adorable little mugshot. :)

Had lunch here yesterday and am SOLD! Had the Rocky Pt burger and it was all that I hoped it would be and more. Love the fact that they serve their burgers w/a huge steak knife impaled in your burger. Nice touch. Fries were fat and mealy - very filling. They did get the wrong burger out to me, but did make up for it by correcting it quickly (ordered mine rare).  Also tried 2 of their Bloody Mary's and they def served as my "hair of the dog" and chased my headache away nicely.  I wld like to try the Old Town location though. The one in N. Scottsdale/Phx is a bit tame, but that's okay as I wanted to visit w/my friends.   Sit on the patio - good for ppl watching and you can still see the football games on. :)

Huge fan of the upscale theater w/dining and leather, huge seats!   Gotta say that the sloped floors make for every seat being a "good seat" in the house; even in the back row - excellent view (and I'm short!).   I didn't study the menu too much, and ordered a water and Diet Coke. My date (who ended up being a jerk, but that's besides the point) ordered Chicken Nachos. Very tasty but pretty "wet" w/gobs of sour cream, etc. Normally, I wouldn't be so concerned but have you tried digging for a solid chip under goop in the dark, and on a date? Was tasty once I found chips. :)  Prices of tix? Don't know - my jerky date paid in advance for tickets. :)  American Sniper, btw - was excellent. Very deep, but great flick. If you're squeemish, probably want to avoid.  Clean stadium as well as bathrooms - great job!  Friendly service too.

I was referred here by Geico from a recent accident (not my fault, for the record...) to have my front bumper repaired.  From the very beginning, Gerber was professional and made my car repair a VERY seamless process. The front Receptionist was cheerful and explained all of the details to me beautifully. They have an onsite car rental division which stepped in to handle my "interim" car also.  My rep w/Gerber constantly called my cell w/any updates and gave an accurate ETA of when my car would be finished.   My right bumper came back good as new and I was impressed with their quality. Great job!

This place is straight up kool-n-the-gang for custom spray tanning! Not a huge place, but such cute décor!  Had my first tan w/Jessica today - she was such a lamb! Seemed informative and talked me through every step the whole way. It wasn't even awkward that I was wearing a tiny paper bikini bottom w/elastic and my twin girls out to be tanned - she was very professional. Loved that she seemed to love her job and is passionate about the art of spray tan. Very thorough w/after-care instructions on my way out.  I'll be back. For sure.

Stopped by (VERY) for an impromptu sushi pick-up yesterday for dinner. I gotta say - wasn't really wowwed or anything. In fact, I felt the spices were "off" and sushi didn't appear too fresh. It wasn't horrid - I cleaned my plate, but ehhhh.  I didn't realize (until I got inside) that it was a buffet-style. Maybe that's why? I'll stick w/my other go-to places from here out. Spendy too!

Tried this downtown restaurant w/my 2 colleagues for some Italian fare for lunch last week.  The Strand not only has a clever name, but is situated in a great location for folks who work/live downtown, or enjoying a concert/baseball game, etc.  The decor is unique and well-planned, as it's not too bright to create a sort of "cool mystery" vibe. The hanging light fixtures are VERY unique and add dramatic flair!   We didn't dine, but did pick up our lunches at the bar to go. I ordered the grilled salmon with grilled veggies, and my peers had chicken w/pasta.  I anxiously got back to work and was bummed that my salmon was WAY overcooked. I tried to continue eating, but it was near impossible for the dry flaky mass to pass my throat successfully. I picked around the fillet and ate my veggies which were awesome!  I probed my peers for their experience. They both loved their pasta and were left feeling fat-n-sassy!  Despite the dry salmon, I will give them another shot.

Healthy and clean-eating options available at Grassroots. Their menu isn't huge, but does cover small plates, sandwiches, entrees, etc. I tried their Angus Cheeseburger w/shoestring fries and it didn't disappoint.   Prices are high, in my opinion, but the quality is there. Location is prime being on Hayden (south of Shea Blvd).  Our server was helpful and checked in frequently with us.   Grassroots is sort of a plain-Jane type of restaurant with sort of a "vanilla" type of personality, which normally annoys me. It does. But - today, it worked and it was actually refreshing and quite soothing.

This is a *crucial* point if you are ever riding on fumes while on the BeeLine (87), as it's the only stop to petrol within Fountain Hills and McDowell Rd.  Gas prices are pretty competitive and smokes are a steal.  Confession: I like going in here as it's nostalgic for me. They seem to use same brand of cleaning supplies my old pre-school (ca 1979) did. I close my eyes and I'm surrounded by colored construction paper and bulk school glue. Ahhh - memories!

Great hiking spot and amazing views for beginner hikers!  Keep in mind if you're meeting a friend here - it is VERY difficult to articulate exactly where you're parked, etc. I have tried meeting 3 separate friends here within the last several years, and it's taken 20-25 minutes to find each other. Why? Probably bc there's the zoo parking lot, Desert Botanical lot, trail lot, etc - not a LOT of helpful signage either.  Park is doggie-friendly also.

*Note: 4.5 of 5.  Gem of a venue found in the heart of Phoenix!! Last time I went, I happened to be working at Chase Tower, so my parking permit came in like a clutch. There are many lots around to park, but that runs u green and time.  There is a roped off line (even if u have pre-tix in your sweaty fist). Ya gotta wait... Sorry!  Security was firm but friendly. Asked all standard questions, looked in suspicious areas, etc. As long as your friendly and chill, they will work with you.  My BF (ex BF now) surprised me w Paul Oakenfold tickets on a Sat night!!! Paul is a little "older style DJ", but a respectable, badass mutha!  Speakers and equipment was pounding and worked! Some spots were louder than others - it was also packed. No one was snobby, no one threw shade. Everyone was smiling and dancing. I felt comfortable and felt I belonged there. I danced the entire set, btw. Was it just that this was just a group of kool kats?! Or just some assholes rolling on E? Well whatever, it was soooo much fun!  They do have full bar in venue also. I didn't drink but had a few waters and Sprites.  Hot n sorta stagnant body odor smell though. They may want to look into this further...

Great chill burger place in Scottsdale! Love their décor and music (think various reggae, alternative, classic rock, etc.). A well-misted patio w/ample umbrellas defending the harsh Sonoran sun always is appreciated!  Shared their fried calamari - wonderful! Big chunks in a delish coating of herbs. Served w/lemon wedge and aioli sauce.  Good Happy Hour prices - $2 for Bud Light drafts? Can't complain - I can dig for that under my car seat.   Service very friendly and attentive. Recommend outside on patio but the flies are driving me batty! Maybe consider adding some citronella candles?

I've tried this place 2x now and am a BH groupie,  I think. I'd highly recommend waiting for a coveted patio seating - excellent cityscape views and close enough to people watch (one of my hobbies).  Brunch here is truly divine - especially if it's a nice, blue-sky day. I had the egg frittata and Mimosa. Dinner is great also. Very relaxed and ideal place for date, friends or chill "unwind" place w/coworker(s)!   Try the ceviche tacos - I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. The Tots (Tater) are scrumptious also.  Also LOVE the fact that they have ability to make the Nat'l drink of Peru - the Pisco Sour.   My colleague and I were treated like royalty here - customer service blew me away. We had 2 separate servers (one for meal and other for drinks, etc), and they were so friendly and helpful. They both did frequent check-ins without being pesky flies. Unfortunately, I didn't catch their names. Our female server never batted an eye when I requested "a side of olive brine for my STRONG dirty martini". Made me feel nice inside. :)  Great job, Hound!

Kelly's is one of my go-to spots for watering holes in Old Town. I don't feel "too old" here but I also don't feel the place is crawling w/geriatrics either. Good diverse mix of ppl.  It's pretty chill still around 9 or 10p ish but then gets pretty packed around 11 onward.  The servers are so COOL and nice. I always try to tip pretty generously w/them.  Try to ceviche here also - it's tasty. Have a friend who puffs cancer sticks? Send them on their merry way out to the patio w/the other puffers.

Found yet another sparkling gem in the Hills!  I always assumed this place was pushing franks with perhaps Greek sides solely based on the name alone. I don't really like hot dogs so I always bypassed. So glad I tried the other night.  I had the Mixed Gyro entree and these guys hit it out if the park! Homemade pita bread served with very generous amounts of chicken and beef. Spices were divine! They served my plate with Tzatziki sauce and hummus - to die for!!!  Can't wait to go back!  Way to make this meal better? Have 2 Grecian Gods named Orion and Adonis feed me by hand while lying on a chaise lounge. And they're wearing small (faux) animal pelts across their privates. Oh, and they can fan me with olive tree branches too.

I don't have a dog, but when (and if) I do adopt one, I will take he/she here. For sure.  I did, however, take Baby Girl, the pint-sized Chihuahua, I was dog sitting here the other Saturday. She had a ball! Yes, she embarrassed the hell outta me by snarling at every dog there, yes. But, I think she does have some deep-rooted "small dog syndrome" issues and I will say she doesn't discriminate - she did that w/every pooch.  Love that they have doggie pools for quick dips, nice grass for playing/pooping/rolling, water,  and segregated parks for the biggies and smalls.   It's everything one would want in a dog park!

Bought a 15 visit package w/Groupon and am SO glad I took the plunge! I, of course, consulted my trusty Yelpers' advice before purchasing and JABZ delivered!  The studio is a good size (I didn't feel cramped) and LOVE the fact we use real "boxing equipment" and have a ring/dummy. I want my upper arms to look like Michelle Obama's by the time I'm done w/my 15 visits. NOTE: I"m doing these sessions AND going to my regular gym (Mountainside Fitness) too.  Len (owner) seems very informed and is motivating!   Only drawback would be lack of signage - took me 10 minutes of circling to find it. :)

Fantastic Italian (healthy too!) restaurant at Gray Hawk in N. Scottsdale! Love that they offer patio seating w/padded chaise lounges/chairs and illuminated white lights strung over you! Such a great touch.  The views are pretty great, you can see the nicely groomed course while you dine. Service was cheerful and attentive (almost too much?).  I had the Islander pizza which consisted of pineapple, speck (Italian-style Prosciutto) and thinly-sliced jalapenos. Perfect combo for me and I was happy. My very health-conscious friend had the Kale Salad with chicken. I felt a slight twinge of guilt, but still enjoyed my pie and took some home for later.  I'll def be back for more!

Stopped here for first time last night on an impulsive whim. It was getting late, and I needed fuel fast.  So glad I did stop! I ordered the Turkey/Provolone on wheat - Jersey Mike style (w/seasoning and oil, etc). Didn't look hugely appetizing so I was a tad apprehensive. Got back home, and wow... such a symphony of flavor and textures! Generous w/their meat portions (they slice it before your very eyes after you have ordered) and excellent bread recipe.  Maybe since I went Jersey style, I added mega sodium amounts, but it was on the salty side. That obviously didn't stop me from 86-ing my Sammy. ;)  Fast and fun customer service w/smiles!  I'll certainly be a regular here. Great job!

Dynamic spot in Tempe Marketplace for decent quality "bar food"! If you're a penny-pincher, be mindful of the Happy Hour deadline to score your 1/2 off appetizers, inc Flatbreads, etc.  My date and I did family style HH apps which included:  1. Fried Calamari - he didn't partake and that was fine by me bc it was delicious!! Probably could have backed off of the fried breading a bit, but still GOOD!  2. Buffalo boneless wings - Oh-Em-Gee! Soo good - w/Blue Cheese, dy-no-mite!  3. Bruchetta - very VERY good also. Would have liked to seen our bread a little but harder/toasted but very yummy.  Service was stellar - Kim waited on us and she was a genuinely enthusiastic person. Very attentive and sweet. Great job! She also took our shtick/jokes which I also adored about her.

The Federal's location, (Central Ave) in northern part of downtown Phoenix, alone is desirable to folks working within Central corridor/downtown areas. Great stop for after-work apps or dinner!  I tried their Chicken Parm which had a unique sauce that made it a new experience for one of my old stand-bys. I tried my friend's Hawaiian pizza and it was thin and full of flavor. Hardly any grease.  Our server was a doll and checked in w/us frequently. On a Friday evening, I only had to wait 10 minutes for a table for 2. I also love that they offer free valet service.  Be prepared for a noisy dining experience - the place was packed and tables/booths are near one another. Try not to get annoyed (like I did initially); let the buzz of the lively patrons give you energy after a long day at work. :)

Ever miss playing with your friends at recess? Well, you can again at The Yard!  I was quite impressed with this venue on Saturday night, I must say. First of all, LOVE that Yard is "ridin shotgun" with one of my faves, Culinary Dropout. This place is pretty genius in my eyes, bc they have so many activities going on such as Ping-Pong and bean bag toss but still has the "lounge" vibe w/their couches off to the side. Yes, there were pretty ppl here but I never sensed any lame snobby-ness.   HINT: Parking is sort of a bitch. Park across the street by Basha's, but beware that the entrance is in the back.

Oh how I was over-joyed when my beloved Senor Taco opened a 2nd location in Fountain Hills!!  You guys/gals really do "get it right". I have made several referrals to visiting company (from out of state) and have rec'd rave reviews from them on their dining experience.   Extra EXTRA hungry? Then try the Senor Burro. I dare you. Soooo delish and sooo huge. I'm serious, that thing comes out and I swear it weighs a couple of lbs. It looks like a 2-year old's leg! Ok, so I don't eat the whole thing in one setting. I can squeeze out a good 3-4 meals from this menu must have!   Shrimp Burrito is another fave of mine. Lovely. And the churros?? OMG... thought I'd died and gone to heaven. Those are always served FRESH out of the fryer and have the perfect combo of cinnamon/sugar. Be careful - too much enthusiasm will yield burn blisters on top of your mouth. You have been warned.

Very well done restaurant in an appropriate, non-corny Western theme.   They have a very attractive breakfast/brunch menu selection. I, personally, had a fried egg and Turkey Sausage (which was amaze-balls). Try the freshly-squeezed OJ Mimosa - I promise it won't disappoint!  Service couldn't had been any better - staff was quick and courteous!  Only draw-back was the cloudy weather yesterday which compromised the spectacular view from patio.  Great place to take out-of-town guests.

This fro-yo place does rate a perfect score by this Yelper, as it:  -has aesthetically pleasing (well, at least to me...) decor. Everything's white, including the tables/seats, hanging lamps, etc. Feels very clean and sleak.  -has tasty flavors of yogurt. I don't like when my yogurt is too tart or tangy.   -is clean and well-stocked toppings. From the bathroom, to the dining area - this place is pleasing  -plays house music! This was on a Sunday afternoon, so maybe it depends on who is working, but I appreciated it!

I've been dying to go to this since I moved here in mid-2010, and so finally went this past Saturday night. I'm a lady who LOVES lights at night, but add in that the lights take shapes of various zoo animals?!? Even more enticing...  I did buy a ticket online (which saved me $2), so I didn't have to stand in any sort of line. I parked in the Main Lot which was free but my friend told me (she got there 45 min before me) the Main Lot was full and had to park in lot on VanBuren, which sorta sucked. Hmmm... guess there are advantages to being late for everything... It would be great if they offered the VanBuren lot folks some sort of shuttle which circles at certain intervals - especially when it's winter time.  I wasn't prepared for the UTTER wonderland of lights ahead of me. Really. It was sooo spectacular and awesome. My ADD went into overdrive and I was darting my head every which direction that I couldn't walk a straight line. The entire walk took us less than 2 hrs, but we had children and elderly person with us also. Plus took a ton of photos.  Be sure to visit the camels!! I didn't realize how cute their faces are! They remind me of llamas - such characters. Think they were sleepy as one camel was plopped down resting and one kept yawning.   Zoolights does have a pretty elaborate food court offering various options, but I didn't stop to check types or even prices.  I was so impressed, I would consider making this an annual event as tradition.

TOCA Physical Therapy totally rocks the casbah! NOTE: I will write a separate review on TOCA (surgeons) later...  I currently work w/Erik and Tyler (sorry, don't know last names!) and they couldn't be any greater. They communicate expectations, goals, etc consistently with me and always push me to do my best. I like that they don't sugar-coat anything either - I like honest/raw truth when it comes to my health and they deliver!  They are always available to answer any questions I have also and make PT as enjoyable (if that's possible) as they can. They also don't mind if I mutter obscenities if the pain gets bad.  I also like the fact that they make suggestions or alternatives. For example, I like to be cheap and save money if I can. Instead of buying a brand new therapy strap for stretching from a medical supply store, use an old (but clean) dog leash. Done! I love that!  Recepcion is also great work work with as they are always cheerful and helpful.  Great job, TOCA PT!

Mojo's is a hidden Italian restaurant in Fountain Hills. Sort of odd location, as it's tucked in residential area in modern-day suburbia.  My parents are ga-ga over their thin-crust pizza, so we all agree that we will dine here last Sat night.  I order a side salad w/a side of Ranch as well as a Hawaiian calzone. Not to piss-n-moan but the following went down:  -Side salad showed up drowned in Ranch. I let it go, that's fine. -Took forever to get our dinner, but calzone showed up and looked great. I broke the "bread blister" on my calzone, and a weird watery liquid weeps out. Ham juice - wtf?? -Take a bite of the calzone - taste nothing but yeast - raw bread dough. I visually inspect my calzone and confirm it was undercooked. I send my meal back.  The server was very apologetic and helpful. She took back my calzone and brought me a slice of pizza. By this time, I was so hungry, I would have been ecstatic w/a stale Saltine.

Out of the conveyor belt sushi establishments, I'm a fan of the newer Teharu at FLW/101. It's definitely closer to my home than Sushi Station (Desert Ridge), which is a plus!  It was a good sign that we had to wait to be seated at an odd time of 2:30p on a Saturday, IMO. My dad and I sat at the bar which gave us close access to plated sushi whizzing by, waiting to be snagged by eager hands.  I consumed:  *Seaweed Salad: big fan, but don't be afraid of adding more spice! *Rainbow Roll: nicely done! *Spider Roll: THE best and my favorite - nice presentation! *Spicy Tuna: also, a hit *I Love Salmon Roll:  good, but used too much rice.  Dad ate even more than I did, and we each had 2 green teas. Total bill? $27-something. Not too shabby on the purse strings either...  I'll be back for more - Teharu - you have been warned.

Solid 4.5 of 5 stars - top notch, top notch (manic clapping).  My colleague suggested we all dine here this past Friday and I'm so glad she did! It's only a 5 min drive from my office and GOOD!!   We were going to get our lunches to go, because every table was occupied, but the stars were aligned and we got in the back bistro tables. Loud, very loud lunch crowd. Again, my ears are sensitive so the volume pains me and makes me rage, mean-mug the perps, and run outside. And choice of music was Country/Western in a Mediterranean/Middle Eastern fast food place? Errr... Nooooooo. Never, ever do that again, please. Not a fan of that genre but doesn't jive w the flavor of the joint. I need exotic sort of pop music from Lebanon or some shit...  The beautiful thing is that you build whatever you want to eat! It was a little daunting and laborious to use my brain during my lunch but I got in my flow. Tried the salad bowl with gyro meat, spicy hummus, grilled eggplant, and tzatziki sauce. Soooo wonderful; slightly different taste in every bite if you don't mix it, which is fun.  I ordered a piece of warm pita bread w salad but I think they should automatically throw this in for salad bowls... Don't you?? Haha  I'll return very soon for more dining experiences!

Round of a huge applause goes to Nori today! Wow. Their sushi blew me away today, truly.  Excellent service (frequent water refills and check in's) goes a long way with me.  Elaborate, user-friendly menu and order sheet.  Love their interior design - their choice in chartreuse green and muted gray works very well. Very clean and sleek. Contemporary vibe.  Their sushi was very fresh and impressive.  This girl will definitely be back for more!!

Hello fellow Yelpers! Tired of going to your chains such as Denny's, IHOP and Waffle House? Then I'd suggest you run your azz over to Original Breakfast.   NOTE: Be prepared to wait for a table. Yes, they're pretty slammed on the weekends.   I ordered the Big Gooey Scramble Mess and when I tasted it, thought I was in some divine universe because I heard harps and saw angels circling. True story.  Even their black coffee was great, ppl! And, it was presented in our very own carafe for self-service warmups?! Whaa??   Service was so accommodating (by bestie and I prefer to sit in booths on the perimeter, not at table in middle of room), by moving us to a better table. Our server did frequent check-ins and answered our questions without any 'tude. I did tip her very well.   So, it's settled - I think I'm in lust/love with this restaurant. I'm in deep, folks.

Oh, Jack - we've been through so much together: bad days at work, GREAT days at work, drunk muchies/hangovers, pig-out days...  I especially love your cheeseburgers and 2:1 tacos. The season curly fries always win my heart - especially when dipped in ranch.   Milkshakes aint too shabby either but I don't crave them so much anymore.   Anyone else recall in the mid-80s when they tried to do a marketing/branding revamp and change their name to Monterey Jack's? I do! Can't remember how long it stayed that way and switched back. Sort of similar to epic fail by Coke launching "New Coke". ;)

I fell in love today and that lover's name is Hopdoddy.   From the get-go, one will notice their unique concept of ordering your food in line, and then seating yourself. Self-service ice water w cone-shaped cups are effectively placed for folks waiting in line. Samples of frozen margarita are generously offered to patrons. One server looked at my leg brace and crutches and told me to take a seat and my food/drink will be ordered sitting!! That is creating a great customer experience in my book!!  The ambience is hep-cat and cool w tunes from B Marley, Fleetwood Mac, etc washing over you.  Staff has genuine smiles and fab attitudes. They seem to "want" to be there working.  Had a medium burger w cheese - so scrumptious! Truffle/parm fries were well-seasoned and served cone-style. Margarita was perfect blend!

Great place for authentic Thai! And, close to my home (even better)!  I had the Shrimp Pad Thai (medium level spice) which was scruptious! NOTE: I can handle my spice, okay, but medium was enough to water my eyes AND clear my sinuses.  Ordered chicken lemongrass soup. Presentation was awesome (complete w/flame in middle of pot), but disappointing combo. I didn't care for the huge chunks of ginger casually floating in my soup, as I thought they were merely bamboo shoots. I felt like someone squirted Lemon Pledge in my mouth. Not cool.  Jasmine (hot) tea was great also! Not too strong and went well w/dinner options.  Location is odd - it's a part of a quiet (and dark) strip mall. Service was friendly and attentive.

Boy, I sure am GLAD that I tried The Gladly yesterday! I sorta felt like a tool typing that out, but it truly rocked my being, from the service to the food choices/quality.  My friend and I were part of a newer Meetup.com event for Urban Brunchers, so we were seated in the side reception/banquet type room. Wasn't digging the dark, large shoe box, no windows area, but what-evs. We had our own bar in there so that was sorta pimp.  I chose their Spicy Bloody Mary. Dude. They make their OWN tomato-based mix. I saw in their stew pot!! The time and care paid off, bc their Mary was phenomenal!  Since its Chopped Salad has its own Facebook page, I had to order one to see for myself. I must say, I was disappointed when the rainbow-colored ingredients came on a smaller plate. I thought, "This isn't it, is it?". I bitched to my friend. I mixed and poured. My attitude came to a screeching halt and did a 180. HOLY Sheyat! So effing tasty!! I'm hooked. For life.  The owner/GM gave us free salad cards to use in the future too! I almost peed a little.  I'll be back for sure.

Tried this coffee house for first time this morning en route to work.  Love the fact that they do offer a drive-thru (especially during warmer months), and have a friendly staffer waving to traffic every single morning as I speed down 7th Street. '  So, I park in front, and a man opens the door for me and wishes me a good morning and a "thanks for stopping". All eyes on me as I approach the counter *pressure on Erin*. More kudos and positive reinforcement from staffers for ordering an Iced Vanilla Latte and chocolate cream-cheese muffin. Yikes.   Payment was a breeze, as they offer e-receipts from their iPad!  The tall man behind the counter advised me to taste the drink before deploying to make sure it was "just right". Again, eyeballs on me as I nervously sipped. Thank God it was great! Whew. I smile and praise them for the drink quality.  As my way out, more "Good Days" and "Thank you".   While I LOVE nice staff members, etc., sometimes TOO much of a good thing is overwhelming. :( I wouldn't have been surprised if multi-colored confetti be tossed at me upon my exit. Doing it right guys, just reel in the customer service a tad.

Stopped here on a VERY spontaneous whim and am actually glad I did.  Wasn't terribly han-gry but could use some body fuel to quiet the growing demon in my belly. Ordered Greek Salad and Hummus/Pita.  Total bill came to $15 something which seemed a tiny high but I didn't challenge.  LIked that the gentleman tossed my Greek salad (hee hee) right before my eyes. Buttt.... black (boring) canned olives?! What about Kalmata or something with a little bit of class? Smh  Flavors of salad were still great! Hummus and fresh, warm pita totally made up for the black olive no-no which just cheapens it. Probably 2nd best hummus I've ever done tried.

Just had THE BEST facial of my life this afternoon w/Christine. You HAVE to check this place out!  My mom treated me to a 1-hr facial today and I am still basking in relaxation and my skin feels dewy and glows.  Checking in was a breeze and refreshing w/their running water sounds of tranquility and complementary flavored refreshments. Décor is appealing and put me instantly in "spa mode".  Christine led me back to my private, dim room and asked me to completely de-robe. At first, I admit I was taken aback a bit as I was just getting a facial, but knew it was standard. I did leave my panties on. But, you slip into a freshly-made heated bed and it's sooo worth it!  There was constant hot towels, massaging, great smelling product applied at all times. Plus, they massage your feet, legs, upper chest, hands, and arms. HEAVEN!  I was also prepared for potential high sales pressure. I really didn't sense ANY, which also won me points. I only was recommended one product for hyper-pigmentation which was priced around $28.   I was so relaxed and floated out of New Serenity. I will definitely be back!

Their food is just wonderful. It is.  Brought my dad here last July for birthday lunch and dined on the patio which offered such nice views! It was warm that day (mid-July), but I recall a breeze which felt like a hairdryer on low setting blowing on me occasionally. I had their Cobb salad and they were portion-generous with all Cobb goodies!   Now, fast forward 6 months to this afternoon - my BFF and I called for take out and I had their Ahi Tuna Poke and wow... For $12, it was a lot of tuna chunks with diced avocado and cucumber mixed with dressing. So exquisite and mouth-watering. Was not disappointed! Also had bowl of AZ Tortilla Soup- very hearty and well-seasoned, but had a smoky, chipotle taste which I'm not the biggest fan.  Great service and decent prices here, Yelp peoples. Love their dining room tables and oversized chairs also.   Location is so ideal for me - maybe a 2 minute drive from my house??

Spray tan sessions for $19?!? I had to investigate this evening for myself.  First of all, love the location being on FLW and 101 freeway. Perfect for me commuting home from work. Love the simplicity of the salon, modern but welcoming feel. The owner greeted me w/a huge smile and walked me through entire process from start to finish.  Complementary alcohol is optional but of course I had to partake to get the "true experience". They have wine, champagne, and beer available. I went w/the champs as I was in luxurious mood. ;)  I was led to the changing room and handed a black satin robe and locked my clothing up in a locked locker. Then, hung out in the cute "lounge" area w/magazines on bistro tables w/flat screen tv.   I did the Pura machine and it was pretty easy to use. The British lady (automated voice) is very clear and easy to understand. I smiled every time she said "Assume the position" in her snooty Brit accent. But, then again, I'm easily entertained...It did remind me of that scene also in the very first Austin Powers movie (where Austin was melted from being frozen since 1969 and he was being prepped in 1997 to hit the streets?). But... I digress.  Another added plus for me is that the Pura machine did a full-body pre-treatment, which was all pH balanced. NICE!! My past Mystic machines never done NOTHIN' like that for me before? Plus, all tanners are offered plastic (individually wrapped) noseplugs and breathing aids/filters. I didn't bother w/those, but it was a nice touch.   Oh, and warm "body drying"? I felt like how my car must feel after it's wash/wax! Bonus!  This is my new spray tan place. Really great place!

This is my NEW stop for nails, toes, and eyelash service!   First, they are VERY close to my house (7 min drive at most) which appeals greatly to me, and their prices are reasonable.  I've always had very good customer service from all employees here and they know me by name now and always go above and beyond to meet my needs (usually last-minute).  My favorite eyelash technician is Lily. Lily is very gentle w/me and has been the only tech who is able to apply w/very minimal burning effect (from glue fumes) to my peepers. She listens to what I'm wanting and delivers beautiful results and consistent application.  There's also a good selection of colors to choose, and I love the wide variety of packages you can buy (callus removal, sugar scrub).

I was SO thrilled to try this place out last night, just for the simple fact that the venue was adjacent to a body of water and had white lights draped along their patio.  The location is really tucked into the suburbs of Tempe, so this isn't a place you'd randomly stumble upon driving by.  Live music at both the bar and the restaurant on Saturday night. My friends and I sat on the patio and we could hear both musicians playing over each other. Rather confusing...  Our server (Jacob) was soo nice and had a joking demeanor, but forgot if he had/hadn't placed our order! We tried jogging his memory with menu items and the joke I made, and he finally remembered he had. He also forgot my sugar for my iced tea. It was hard to get annoyed w/him because he was so friendly and apologetic.  I ordered the Mahi-Mahi sandwich and it was so dry that I took maybe 4 bites at most. The seasoning was great, but I just couldn't choke down the sandwich. Steak fries were tasty so I nibbled away at those.  All in all, it wasn't terrible but it wasn't anything so special that would drive me to revisit again. It has fantastic potential - I hope the owner(s) read Yelp reviews and use the feedback for positive change.

NOTE: I've only visited the JMS's location at FLW/101, but they HAVE to be all the same, right?!?  To give you a little back story, my BFF is a legit Jimmy John's fan. And, I am not (anymore). Ever. In order to convince my friend of the extra drive to the closest Jersey Mike's and what they do to their various sandwiches, and how you can see them slice meat/cheese for your sandwich, I had prepared a stellar PowerPoint presentation including an essay (which I narrated) on why this would be good for her.  BFF (stubborn, mind you) finally relented and weakly mumbled that she'd at least try Jersey Mikes, blah blah... *VICTORY*!!! **NOTE: No presentation, speech, etc was a part of my convincing - it did cross my mind though.  Since I obtained that challenging "buy-in" from bestie, I prayed to all entities that this location would be similar to my beloved N Scottsdale location. If this joint didn't deliver greatness, it would just be a bowl full of dick soup. And, no one wants that... do they?  We park and enter the establishment in wrinkled sweats/hoodie/10-year old Uggs with holes around toes (my attire) and bestie with PJ bottoms/tank top (hers) and a general "don't mess with me - it's been a long night" scowl across her head. No one even put makeup on. I can't recall if even a brush was run through my head. Prob... not. I did brush my teeth though! Hmmm, if not, at least I had gum that I was masticating and swirling around...  I assertively started ordering my #13 (Original Italian) and yelped out that for damn sure I wanted it "Jersey Mike style"!  My BFF was a tiny skittish and indecisive with her selections and candidates. To help, a male server offered and fed her some exotic meat. The meat was good but had a kick. We were making progress...  After hemming and hawing, intertwined w/my schticky jokes and my friend's, and then the male server's fun time talk, a sandwich had been selected! BFF took the plunge and did it MIkey's way too! I praised her and promised she would never look back. :)  The server (probably low 20's) was very effervescent and flirty. It was contagious. He got a kick out of us so he threw free cookies at us, as if we were 3 years old with chubby cheeks and dimples. I didn't care, I scooped up the bootie and bid him adieu! Well done - be back!!!  Note- bestie dug her Sammy and suggested we go back to see cutsie server so she can throw some game down. Now, that's a success!!

Great (newer) watering hole for Old Town Scottsdale!   Went this past Saturday night and yes, there was a line. But my group didn't wait which was all right w/me. Packed bodies made the place smell a little like hot roast beef, but whatever.  Drink prices were pretty much on par w/any venue in OT (higher).  I'd like to check this place out during the day, sober and try their actual food. Definitely will return!

Yet another great break-y place to add to my Favorites.   Scramble is jammin' on the weekends, so be prepared for a wait. But, this gives you ample time to study their menu to place your order at front counter. They do offer inside or patio seating.  Decor is bright and cheery - my kind of place. Was also very tidy and hygienic - props to them as they were BUSY!  My ham and mushroom omelette was great! Was so full, that I didn't have chance to eat my hasbrowns.   Yelpers: check in to get your FREE coffee!

Tired of stale, chain bookstores? Restless in your community library? You may want to visit Changing Hands. Especially if you like unusual gifts or novelty-type items.   Aside from the ample inventory of books, you will find such whimsical gifts.   I mean, where else can you buy cat butt gum? Or antibacterial gel for OCD? Tabasco-flavored chocolates? Have some poltergeist haunting your crib? Well, this place has various sage for purchase so that one may cleanse their dwelling of bad vibes/spirits, etc.  And, of course, they have incense sticks/cones and other hippy stuff like homemade soaps, essential oils, blah blah blah...  They also have a full coffee bar towards the back of the store, to amp up while looking at 100 Ways to Make a Cat Like You, or What Your Poop Actually Means. Pure genius.  PS - they're also neighbors with Southern Rail (restaurant) offering Southern food as well as a bar w/karaoke. About a block away from one of the light-rail stops. Take the train and be cool, like I did.

One of my sinful, guilty pleasures, because of the taboo. Why? Well, because of their certain, extreme stances (gay marriage) back in 2012, and all of the hurt and angry hearts caused by the aftermath. I mean, I am not gay, but I do have loved ones (family and friends) who ARE gay, and so this hits home with me. And, even if I didn't have loved ones around me, it would still bother me because it just doesn't seem right...Huge heart for my loved ones and their protection, as well as justice for those who are part of any kind of minority and suffering opposition, teasing, etc.  I mean, their president and COO announced that they are "very much supportive of the family - the biblical definition of the family unit". This "biblical unit" did not meet the same family unit definition that many members of the LGBT.   This whole mess did cause significant damage to Chick-fil-A's reputation as well as lost many loyal customers, as mayors in Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco stepped in to ban any future Chick-fil-A stores being built further on (unless some changes/apologies were made).  On a personal note, I was working for a major Fortune 500 company at the time of this, and my ER Director happened to be gay. She was a very reputable person within our business, and had a long-time girlfriend, as well as tons of dogs. My Director, at the time, barked out some colorful words regarding Chick-fil-A, and I remember feeling bummed that it had to come to this. I dunno...  Our company at the time was coordinating a celebration of diversity within our company, to offer free food, speakers, games, give-aways, etc. When I sat down at our first planning meeting an noticed Chick-fil-A as one of the food vendors, I couldn't help but raise my hand on this on. The more I talked about my concerns and the possible negative responses, perceptions if we serve food from this restaurant, the more nods I got from my peers and Managers. It was unanimious - they were out, and we needed a replacement.  Now that it's 2016, things have simmered down a bit. I know the entire topic hasn't been rested and put to bed - by far... But, this group shouldn't be condemned for their thoughts and stances on life - should they? I mean, it's not like I"m going to be best friends with a Cashier in my future... Or attend their church services ever?  So, more internal dialogue, I have come to a conclusion. I want their chicken and sauces. And Fries. I feel dirty sliding into the drive-thru, but still proceed. The chicken w/sauces and fries were outstanding. Did they change me and/or my core? Hell no. Am I going to visit them frequently? Noo... Once in awhile? Sure, why not. I know what I believe it - period. Just give me your chicken and that's were it all ends. Period.

One of my favorite stops for great burgers and ppl watching. Close to my house and right off of the 101.   They have also scored major points (I mean, major) with me being that they have dog-friendly patios. Not only that, but they *encourage* you to bring your pawed and furry loves.   During oppressive Phoenix summers, their patio has a large (industrial-sized) fan blowing as well as misters. Plus the bright orange umbrellas in full bloom for maximum shade.  I always get their Cheeseburger and can't seem to break out of that comfort zone choice. If you like your burger rare, tell them you want it "pink". Served on a homemade roll and with bacon. It's just a food party going on - excellent seasoning on the patty and grilled to perfection.  Burgers are served with fries (shoestring). Yes, I do like them but they're not my absolute faves. I prefer the larger/meaty tates. :)  Service is always chipper and accommodating.

Great GREAT place if you're needing to see doc and can't get into your PCP and don't wanna mess w/the ER scene.  Clean clinic (which is vital for me) and fast/friendly staff. I went here as a walk-in and was seen within 10 minutes.  Hopefully, I don't need to frequent them again in near future, but they will be my go-to if I need them.  Appreciated also that they have a state-of-the-art BP machine that doesn't pinch your upper arm like a python is squeezing the shit out of you.   Great stuff, Urgent Care Extra!

Went here during my lunch break (due to close proximity) and will never, ever EVER go back. Ever. This was 2 or 3 months ago, maybe?  You see, I had a headache that would not flee my cabeza, despite Aleve, Tylenol, Advil, or ice pack/rest, etc. In fact, the stubborn head pain was going on 2 full days, and I started feeling nauseous and sensitive to light, smells, sounds.   I also started to see tiny little stars if I moved my head "too fast" which in reality, was barely moving.   I consulted Google on all of this. Google results yielded signs pointing at a migraine. Migraine? This would explain the OTC-resistant pain.   So, I drove my myself over to the clinic (donning sunglasses because even sun behind clouds was way too bright). I only wait 10-15 minutes in their waiting room which was smelled of a very strong and aggressive Pine-Sol. Or, maybe the cheap, Mexican brand, Fabuloso. Anyways, the overly-dominant scent angered my head pain further. I slumped down further in the pleather chair and scowled.  I go back to a room, and the PA knocks and walks in. I can't remember her name, but her overall body language and tone of voice wasn't appreciated by me, bc I felt like she didn't believe me.   She asked me questions regarding symptoms of migraines. Some I had, some I didn't and I told her so. I mean, why would I be untruthful? What's the point? Maybe she didn't like the fact I didn't happen to have all symptoms of the classic migraine, and therefore concluded that I must be a drug seeker that is wasting her time!! As the questioning increased, I started feeling like a meth-head or heroin junkie sitting there. It was almost like when I told her I did have a certain symptom and further elaborated on small details, she wanted to ask, "Are you sure?". I didn't like feeling uncomfortable and honestly almost got up and left - even though my head hurt so bad. But, I did stay and kept telling myself that it shouldn't be much longer.  Fast fwd about 20-30 minutes, prescription for Imitrex in hand and $30 copay coughed out, I flew the coop fast. And will not be returning.  **NOTE: I am convinced that I did have a migraine truly, as my headache vanished within 15 min of swallowing an Imitrex.

My occupation gets stressful at times, and because it's a "desk job", my posture is less than acceptable and I probably resemble a slouching monkey. Or the letter "C", whatever you fancy...  Oh, and I have wicked bouts of insomnia too that I'm battling.   My colleagues and I have been entertaining the idea of dipping our toes back into the yoga class pond soon (since Sept/Oct 2015), and we attended our first class last night after work. One colleague researched and made arrangements for a beginners' yoga class w/Caleb, and so we pressed forward and I'm so glad we did. Studio offers free parking and a "burlesque"-oriented studio. It's sexy (think New Orleans) but not over-sexualized and just...well...fun!  Caleb was a delight from the start and exuded naturally positive energy with our class. Since it was for beginners', he slowed the pose transitions down and explained and watched us like hawks for acceptable form and proper breathing. I had a blast!  I may buy a package of classes because it's a definite unique style of yoga that Caleb teaches than my free classes at my gym (Mountainside), as well as experience and I get to do w/my colleagues who I adore!  I just sniffed out the studio's website and learned they offer various classes (different levels) of Burlesque!!! I SO want to do that and am checking into further.

Such a fun 60 minutes of your life spent here. Yes, I paid $30 for someone to lock me inside of a room. But it's exciting and challenges your brain. I'm a fan of both and so the hour FLEW by way too fast.  My bestie and family did "The Apartment". I gotta say, it was tough. I mean, I thought I was a pretty sharp knife in the smarts arena, but this game started to insult my intelligence. And, I thought bestie had some brain matter too. College-educated w/a finance degree, Accountant for a Fortune 500, etc. Bestie just wore a deer-in-headlights look for the hour. Thank God we had 2 other ppl (strangers) who happen to be nice, cool and very keen to the clues. Ummmm... they essentially carried us... (tail tucked between legs)...But I think they had done another room before.   I was overjoyed when I finally shouted out a possible "next step" and happen to have been right and we got another key for the 6 padlocks.   The set-up was elaborate and monitor spitting out clues worked. I can't wait to try other scenarios.   So, we got 4 of 6 clues solved to unlock the 6 padlocks. The moderator/host person unlocked our room to de-cage us and reviewed our unsolved mysteries. One was very very easy, which was a careless oversight, and the other - pretty obscure, IMO. Booo!  They led our defeated team to hold signs for a group pic which indicated our non-victory. I'm a very poor loser and it took every ounce of me to smile and be "okay" with not winning. I get pissed off losing to ppl at Scrabble even. Yeah, I have issues...  Bottom Line: Money well spent for a different type of entertainment, bonding, and team-building experience.  Tips:   1. Go potty before you're locked in the room. Yes, it is possible to be released in order to relieve yourself (they have microphones/cameras in the rooms), but the game would be paused while you went potty. And who wants to be "that" person?  2. Look presentable for the free group pic after your search (i.e. consider bathing, running a comb/brush through hair, etc).  Smart phones are permitted in the locked rooms, but no photography (for obvious reasons). I took mine w/me bc I would definitely start twitching if confiscated.  In a smaller group and joined w/strangers for new team mates? Be nice, don't be a stuck-up asshole. They could really be smart and be a strong contributor. Plus, it's just more enjoyable that way. ;)  5. Make sure you get plenty of rest the night before your search. Speaking for myself, I only had 3 hours the night before and my thoughts were a tad "grainy". The mission is to solve the clues.  6. Only 20% of participating parties actually succeed. I didn't let the low odds get in my way, as I like to defy odds and be the minority. Come with a positive and optimistic attitude.  Happy Hunting!

Rice Paper is a great stop for lunch (or Happy Hour) in your central downtown Phx area. They used to be Bonjour Vietnam, but have changed for some reason.   The venue itself isn't too huge, but is decorated in contemporary design and has add'l tables/seating on patio area.  Service has always been very friendly and helpful. I haven't tried too many items on menu but do recommend the Ahi Tuna (raw) salad. Yum! I had the Filet Mignon Pho for lunch and it was delicious, however, I wish the meat was on the more medium to rare side. NOTE: Cilantro sprigs aren't served by default; if you need this to add to your soup, just ask! :)  Spring Rolls (I was eye-balling with envy) looked tasty too. Next time.

** Crucial Disclosure: Don't eat here if you're wanting the men with large sticks of meat! Giggidy giggidy   I wanted to treat my dad for Father's Day to this concept, but Fogo de Chao was booked solid yesterday. Boooo. Okay, I find an alternate and find Carvalho's and they have availability! Hot dog!  I RSVP and we drive our merry selves to the restaurant. I walk in and the venue is pretty quiet and smaller than I would imagine. And, no gauchos weaving through the dining area! What?! I panic and ask our Server where these meat-pushers were in a high-pitched frenzy.  She politely answered that this restaurant is a Brazilian Kitchen, and they do offer similar cuisine, but don't have the same concept as others do. I nod nicely but pout/sulk after she leaves. I feel like crying a little.  After some internal dialogue and to not spoil my dad's special day, I pull myself together and make the best of it. I'm sure it's good, right?  I quickly learned it was even better than "good"; it was fantastic! Comp plaintain chips were presented quickly and a genuine smile started appearing on my face. Dad and I ordered the same - Picanha Grelhado (grilled steak).   It was SO nicely done and had a superb flavor of spices and was grilled to perfection (but still rare, like I like it!). Was served w/Brazilian potato salad and grilled pineapple ring. Plus, 2 hearts of palm (OMG, num!).  I did have to doggy-bag the food I couldn't finish - it hit the spot later that evening.   Great decor and friendly service. I'll return back in the future.

I frantically call HonorHealth in Old Town Scottsdale to see if there's a miracle that I could see my PCP. Today. And, there isn't, but the Reception connected me with this location who could squeeze me in (within 2 hrs of my call), to see Dr. Rhianna Meadows. Pretty amazing, I know...  I arrive a courteous 20 minutes beforehand and wait (longer than expected) but was promptly invited by a cheerful Med Tech in bright scrubs for my vitals soon enough. Wait in my private room, mmmm... maybe 3 minutes when Dr. Meadows gently knocks on my door. Even though I'm new blood to her, she was able to view my med records from PCP and REALLY helped me out w/my urgent need quickly. Was kind and knowledgable. Offered alternate suggestions to consider, which I always appreciate.  Before I know it, I'm thanking her and staff, and the Rx is being called into Walgreens, F Hills. Well, life is great at this point but Walgreens reports a "medication interaction" FAX that they sent to HH, Tempe, needing response. Ummm... okay... wasn't aware of that, but I made some calls and expedited process/obtained clarifications, etc. so it's turning out okay, but it would have helped if Dr. Meadows caught this and/or brought it to my attention as a heads-up (more proactively over reactively), you know? But I'm still pretty damn grateful she could see me so soon.

**Update:  After multiple (and rather frantic) calls between Walgreens and HH Tempe, as Friday was coming to an end on a Holiday weekend, as well as it was a new Rx for horrid insomnia, I finally bridged the gap with MD response to Walgreens medication interaction alert.  After pulling away from Walgreens drive-thru (very sleep-deprived from 2 hrs of sleep) on Friday night, I noticed it wasn't for the medication nor dose that Dr Meadows and I discussed. It made me feel a little nervous and left "out in the dark" to be honest. Again, a simple 2-min courtesy call would have alleviated all of this. I am high-maintenance with certain things, but my health and new RXs are important. I think it's very reasonable to be well-informed, right Yelpers?!   As it turns out, the newer Rx has worked amazing this weekend with only 1 non-serious side effect. But still... Constructive feedback for HH- communicate better, pls!

My PCP is Dr. Abby Roberts and I've been seeing her for about 3-4 years now. Her offices have moved from Town Center to HH Med Group - Osborn.  First off, the scheduler pulled a miracle and got me in to see my Doc within 24-hr notice. That's sooo awesome!  NOTE: new office is a pain to find - or maybe it's just me?  Larger waiting room which is nice and good selection of magazines/fresh water for patients. No saltwater fish tank though :(  Dr Roberts is always very grounded and never interrupts my babbling which I SOO love. I am not going to go into to too many personal details, but she heard me out re: some of my medications/medical conditions and made a huge exception at her discretion to help me out. I can't tell you how happy I was that she listened to my thought process AND the plans my other doc and I were in the midst of making before I dropped her (due to insurance coverage).  Great job!

Just  as standard as the prior Subway, this one on FLW/100th in N. Scottsdale delivers consistency!  Fast, accurate and friendly is what I seek in Subway visits and this location delivers on-point.  Plus, I love this location as it's on my way home from work. :)

I was pretty hesitant to step foot in Portillo's the other day w/my work colleagues, because I'm not a huge hot dog fan. But to my relief, they do offer other items such as hamburgers, sandwiches and salads so I did actually cross over Portillo's threshold.  Their space is fun with lots of neon signs and other knick-knacks to peer at while one's stuffing their face. Everyone had a smile on their face and worked efficiently.   I had their breaded chicken sandwich w/fries. Fries were so-so, as they seemed to be the crinkled ones from a bag of Ore Ida, but still lightly fried and hit the spot. My sandwich was great; not too much breading and wonderfully seasoned!   I do wish they offered "to go" condiment cups/lids instead of the dine-in paper cups for ketchup, etc. You'll need to ask them for sealed packets!  I'm so glad we stopped here!

Very very tasty Thai cooked/served here! Not a super-great dining-in type experience, as it offers less than 10 tables in a tiny area. Typical restaurant-in-a-plaza atmosphere.   Don't expect them to serve your food on any type of ceramic plates either. They use paper plates - period.  If you're okay with looking past this, brace yourself for the food. It's very obvious they cook to order and only use very fresh vegetables, ingredients, and authentic spices.   My 2 aunts, mom and myself ate family style ordering:  Cashew Chicken Eggplant something-or-other Pad Thai (Chicken) Spring Rolls (appetizer)  Even had good portion size of leftovers after 4 hungry women plowed thru the Thai plates. Total of damage done on bill? Like $30 or $31!! I'd say that's pretty cheap - you can go ahead and do the math on your own. :)  **CAUTION: We ordered a hotness of "3" on all dishes. A "3" is pretty spicy, guys... It was a tad uncomfortable, causing me to furiously ram white rice in my mouth to extinguish such fire, as the water just spread pure pain. Nose and eyes ran to further call out attention to others that I'm a p*$$y. If I had a time machine, I would have requested a 2.5 or a 2.75. Don't try to be a hero/tough guy and ruin a perfectly good meal.   I do find it odd that they don't have disposable serving spoons/forks for family-style tables; we had to use our flimsy, plastic utensils. Pshhh. That's just lame sauce. With coconut milk.
