I just spent 19 hours at Barrows with my daughter  in the emergency room.  She has a very severe neck injury and debilitating pain from it.   3:00 PM  Wednesday August 21.    1 1/2 hour wait outside  waiting room    4:30 PM    we were sent to a room that only had lounge chairs ( No Beds).   11: 30 PM Cat Scan they moved us to another room again no beds only chairs.    1:A    the doctor came in to explain what was going on  and said another doctor would be in shortly    1:30 AM We are moved to a room with a bed but are not admitted to the hospital still in emergency.    3:30 AM doctor arrives  and  lets us know the other surgeons  whom we have not seen  have a plan  to give her the same medication she is already on that has not worked for the last year.  We ask to see the doctor who decided to make up this innovative treatment plan and were told he'd be right in .  5:30 AM  No doctor, we ask a nurse when he would be coming in . answer soon !  7:30 am   Daughter  rings for nurse to get pain meds   8:00 AM still no doctor  Daughter has not been given pain meds since 3:30 am  She is crying  and in real pain ...we find out they forgot about us! Shift change and no one on the floor even knows we are there  8:30  AM  I call medical directors office and tell them what is going on they are sending someone right away !!!!!!!!!  9:00 AM  Doctor from the 1 am visit  night before  walks by our room eating his breakfast  We have not been offered any food or water.   My daughter notices it is him.  I run after him and ask what's going on.  He is a neuro surgeon.  He has already told us she has bulging disks that need treatment.  I ask him to please get her some pain meds.    He states that he left orders to treat her for pain when needed because he believed she was in real pain.  We ask him the plan for treatment and he says we will have to make an appointment at Barrows Spine center.  I ask him for medication for her before we leave he assures me he will recommend the prescriptions we discussed ( he cannot write presriptions only  the ER doc can write prescriptions . The ER doc has not even sceen us.    10:00 am Charge Nurse comes in and give us wrong prescriptions .  I discuss this with him.  They tell me they will have to re-admit my daughter to emergency room in order to get the correct prescriptions because the doctor who was in chage of writing her prescriptions wrote them at 3:30 am that morning and has left and closed her file.  We need to start a new file!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    10:10 am  We walk out with my daughter crying and in the same condition  as when we first arrived.   With written prescriptions that we already have  at home and are not strong enough.    I am appaled at the lack of service, and neglect we received.  DO not go  to Barrows if you want help and a plan to get better .  They are too busy to pay attention to you.  This really happened.!!!!!!!! I would give zero stars but you must at least give one to add this review so others can read it.  19 hours of hell...I can't wait to see the bill for this disservice we have been given!

Last night we sat at the bar with the very comfortable Barber Chairs.  The aroma was amazing.  We had wine and the Gluten free pasta Bolognese...it was wonderful.  I am craving it now and might have to go back tonight.  We watched them cook the pizzas in the ovens., they cook the dough first to make it crispy first and then put on the toppings and bake again...can't wait to have their Pizza! It was very busy.  The staff was attentive.  My new favorite!

Tina does my nails and pedicure!  She's wonderful, I get many complements on my beautiful gel nails.   And the pedicures Woohoo! With the hot  hot rock massage .  As good as it gets.  Too bad they don't serve wine while your getting a pedicure That would be as good as it gets.

Thank you Brielle Block  and staff  at Laseraway for your advise , knowledge of your products and caring! Brielle and the staff helped me to choose the procedure that would give me the best results for my budget   I received the most awsome care and "Thermage "treatment at Laseraway.  The office was clean the staff was caring and attentive.   The entire experience was professional, The office is modern and in an upscale neighborhood .  I knew it was going to be a little painful but the staff while treating me kept asking if I was okay.. Thermage is a little painful but no so much as I had been reading on the internet.  after doing some research I found out the new  tips used for the procedure are important for patient comfort.  They used  the latest technology and tips to administer the procedure .  I went to work the next day.   I can already see the results in my chin and my face looks fresh!  I will d be back  for other treatments  Thank you

Laseraway did a beautiful job using Restylane on my lips and Botox on my forehead.      Brielle answered all of my questionsMade recommendations and scheduled me.    While there I met Brock one of the owners.  Brock is a very caring person.  He asked me if his staff including  Doctor  Anthony Adamire  made me feel comfortable  and  explained everything to me before the procedures.    YES!   He asked me if i was happy and  he thanked me for coming in.  I was sent home with ice packs and instructions.    The lip Injections start out a little painful but then as the Restylane is administered the pain dimishes .  I left there amazed at the instant effects of the Restylane .!  WOW  Today my lips are a little swollen and  I have mild pain.  The Botox I was told will take effect in 5 days.  My lips are suppose to  be less swollen by next week.  I am very happy with the results and the professional services I have  received here at Laseraway.   Thank you...I will be back.  Not sure what's next but there will be more treatments.

Terrible Zervice but great foodzz!     We sat at the bar, it was a slow night only 4 others were sitting at the bar.  Bartender ignored us!  He was cleaning.  Finally he took our order after about 10 minutes. We almost got up and left.       The food was delicious, we had the green chili pork stew with tortillas.  The food runner was great he saved the day, I wish I could remember his name to thank him, he attended to all of our requests for hot sauce and more tortillas.   Usually my experiences at  Ztejas  are  great! The food is consistently good and the Mango Margaritas are wonderful. This location needs to step up to the great service we always have at  the location on  Tatum and at Scottsdale Fashion Square location.   This new Ztejas is beautiful with a gorgeous patio and would be great this time of year to sit outside.  We may give them another chance.
