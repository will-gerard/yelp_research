This is only limited to one item I've gotten from here, the orange chicken, which I was hoping would at least be as good as Panda Express. Nope, way way worse. First off, it was breaded like sweet and sour chicken usually is. Never seen that before and definitely not what I wanted. Otherwise the people seemed friendly and it was a decent price. But if they can't figure out something as simple as orange chicken why should I bother to try anything else?  I like New China down the street more.

The sushi here is great and I LOVE the cucumber salad. The service is always good and their other entrees aren't bad either. Can be pricey sometimes though for some entrees.

I live really near this place and compared to the China Buffet down the street it is ten times better. I think Chinese food comes down to what you like and what you order but I think this place is great. It's pretty cheap, they deliver, and they're fast. I liked the lo mein and chicken and broccoli and the General Tso's is the best I've had since I left the East Coast. Not totally perfect, but a whole lot better than most of the other Chinese places I've tried out here.

I love this place. I usually get take-out and the food is amazing. I usually get the salad with chicken gyro meat and a piece of baklava (amazing). I didn't think I'd be able to find good Greek food in AZ (especially Mesa) but this place is sooooooo good.
