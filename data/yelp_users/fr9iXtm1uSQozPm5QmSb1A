Walking in, probably the first thing I noticed was that the carpet looked like it was straight out of a Chuckie Cheese.  Don't worry though, that's pretty much the only thing they have in common.  The service was pretty good.  Drink orders were fast and they dropped warm chips and hot and mild salsas at the same time to snack on.  I ordered the Flautas with shredded chicken.  The number 7 combo.  It seemed to come pretty quickly and was quite tasty.  The refried beans were topped with a good amount of shredded cheese as well.  The guac was quite good as well.  The biggest travesty of this meal was that I had semi recently eaten and was pretty full and unable to finish it.  Price for combo a soda and tip was $20.00  Would definitely go back.

****Disclaimer**** There is no food review here, our experience was bad enough that we didn't even eat here.  It seems pretty consistent with other reviews that this place is pretty bi-polar with their service.  It's a shame because their food seems to come highly rated. ***End Disclaimer***  So after wanting to come here for a while now some friends and I were finally able to get in.  The first thing we noticed upon walking in was the strong bleach smell in the little are by the host/ess stand. We stood there for a couple minutes and the smell bothered me to the point of actually sneezing. We were finally seated after someone seemed to notice we were standing there.   Upon being seated we were given your standard issue sushi order sheet and some menus. Here's where the proverbial crap hit the fan. Their menu is comprised of item names only, with no descriptions at all. This wouldn't normally be a problem if half the items weren't given Japanese names. We waited 10 minutes before we were served drinks by not our server and she walked away. 5 minutes later she came back and asked if we were ready and we said we were having trouble deciphering the menu and she said ok and walked off instead of seeing if we needed help with something. When she came back 5 minutes later I asked if they had something that described the menu items and she said yes and went and got a bowl of sand with little clips holding business cards that held sushi descriptions.  And then left again.  They were for the 5 most expensive sushi rolls they had.   Finally she came back after a few minutes and we started to ask her about what stuff was. She answered some questions and then my vegetarian friend asked her about vegetarian choices other than the 3 things listed. She immediately recommended 2 items with bacon in the name to our friend's horror and then couldn't answer what sauces had fish in them as their menu had noted that some do.  She then left us yet again to make a choice.  We decided for our friend's own peace of mind, and my already annoyed attitude that we should probably just go eat at Eastwind where we knew they had awesome Sushi, Service, and Prices.  Now some might argue that it's our own fault that we aren't super sushi veterans and should already know what we are ordering, but it's my philosophy that you don't have to be an expert on something to enjoy it.  Especially not food.    I hate to give this place this low of a rating without even trying the food, but to waste a half hour or so before even really getting to the point where we could have had food being prepared is ridiculous.  On top of the fact that the waitress didn't seem too keen to help us figure out what the heck we were even ordering.

First thing I have to say is that this place is hard for us more nocturnally inclined folks to eat at since they close at 8pm.  When we did get our first shot at feasting on the delicious cuisine they had to offer boy were we happy.  The basic Gyro meal with a Gyro, fries and a drink was 7.75 and that is exactly what I ordered, not wanting to try anything fancy the first time.  It took maybe 5 minutes from order to food sitting in front of me and the first thing I noticed was that there was quite a heaping of thin sliced lamb meat piled onto the fresh looking pita slathered in sauce and topped with some onion.  I opted out of getting tomato.    First bite was awesome, and the next bite was just as good if not better as my brain realized that I had probably found the best Gyro's I've had in Phoenix.  They weren't super greasy, the tzatziki sauce was great, and the onions were nice and crispy.  I ate the whole gyro before even taking a stab at the fries.  Probably not coincidentally the fries were actually quite good as well.  Yet again, not super greasy, and with ketchup, they had just the right flavor.    They have Veggie friendly meals, and also chicken, steak and Filafel as well as a whole Chicago menu with things like Vienna Beef hot dogs and pizza puffs.  Overall it's a definite must try in Phoenix.

So without a single notion of what a Pasty actually was, I joined my usual "Find unique and interesting places to eat" group of friends to try this place out.  And boy am I glad I did.  We took a seat at the bar that overlooked the kitchen and I started off with a 20oz glass of one of my favorite wheat beers; Hoegaarden.    As we sat there watching one of the employees make a batch of Pasties, my friends and I chatted casually with himself and a few other employees about the place and what was good to eat and such.  Being adventurous I decided to try out one of the many veggie menu items and went with the Chicken Basil and Pesto Pasty.  It featured vegetarian chicken and I was curious as to how it would stack up against the real thing.  It was served quite prettily shortly after we ordered and I dug in.  Delicious!  The veggie chicken obviously wasn't a dead ringer for the real deal, but I felt it worked quite flawlessly with the rest of the contents of the dish.  After that we decided on different desserts and I chose the chocolate rum bread pudding.  It was different than any bread pudding I've ever had for starters because it was chocolate.  Next it had a crunchy outer shell that contained the gooey goodness inside.  I was informed that they were sadly out of the vanilla drizzle that normally accompanies it as well, so that would have also made it unique had they not been out.  It's also worth noting that the employees were an absolute blast to interact with as they were playing quirky and fun songs off their iPod and were just being outgoing and fun in general.  It was mentioned though that the manager was not there at the time and that usually had the place had more patrons (there were maybe 2 other couples in the place) in it they would have had to conform to more "professional" standards.    Overall it's a shame I live so far from the place because I could easily see myself becoming a regular.  Prices after pasty, dessert and 2 20oz beers and tip was just around 27 if I remember correctly.

So friends and I had been meaning to try this place out for a while and we had finally gotten a chance to go.  It's setup very familiar to a Pei Wei almost where you have your menu off to the side of the queue and approach the counter to order before taking a number and your seat.  The establishment was very clean and well lit as well as having a pretty nice quiet atmosphere.  I think it was like a Wednesday morning if my memory serves me right.  I ordered the French Toast and a Martinelli's Applejuice from the quite attractive young lady that was working the register.  I took my number to a table that was half seats half bench and my friends shortly followed suit.  A random conversation about iPads later and out food had arrived.  The French Toast was actually Baguettes that had been Frenchtoastified and they were delicious.  I also got some rosemary potatoes which were a little too rosemary for my taste, and s couple pieces of cherrywood smoked bacon.    Now if you've read any of my previous reviews you might have gathered that I'm rather picky about bacon.  This stuff however was amazing.  Thickly cut and perfectly crisp without being hard or chewy.  I'd definitely say that I'd take Cherrywood smoked bacon over Applewood any day of the week.  Prices were good, I think it came out to like 15 after tip.  Overall if I am able to drag myself outta bed early enough again I'd definitely take another visit.

Well, I was surprised to see the not so great reviews here.  The first time a friend and I attempted to eat here we came up to the place as they were closing and they seemed really apologetic.  There were 2 people working and one of them told us the hours of operation and gave us a couple menus saying that next time we can call in our order ahead of time if we liked.  Coming back a few days later we were helped by a seemingly pleasant man.  He took all our orders and went to throw the patties on the grill before helping the group of 4 behind us.  Personally I thought that was nice because I was hungry, however I could see the group behind us not liking it.  I ordered "The Box" which was a cheeseburger with french fries and a large drink.  My two friends got the same thing with bacon as well.  When the food was served it was hot and displayed nicely.  To the other reviewer's comment about there not being any sauce other than the basic condiments or the paid sauces, I'll say that the bacon burgers come with a cup of chipotle ranch by default.  We all mistook it for fry sauce and as I didn't get one, I asked and even though they do charge for the side cups, the employee gave me one for free anyhow.  My burger was perfectly cooked just on the verge of being red but had crossed over to pink, personally just the way I like it.  However, one friends was closer to grey and he said it seemed a bit dry.  Here's where I'll say that it might be a wise idea to just mention how you like it cooked when you order.  Overall it was a great burger, honestly better than my first experience with the new Five Guys that recently opened near here as well.  Also the fries were quite tasty and all a good cut, with not many litlte short or overly crispy ones.  The bacon on my friends burgers look to be cooked perfectly as well in that it was just about crispy but still soft.  The chipotle ranch that they came with was good and complimented my regular cheeseburger as well as it did the fries.    Overall it was a good experience and a delicous burger that I ate.  I'll definitely go back and hope that I recieve the same service and quality food that I did before.  Also the employee bid us farewell upon leaving.

So this place was pretty much a travesty. The price was definitely cheap which was nice. This however was the regular buffet not the "X-Treme" one for a dollar fifty more which adds access to some fried chicken and mashed potatos and gravy.   The pizza wasn't terrible if you could get fresh slices. They had plenty of old dried out pizzas of various types that had been ignored for days probably. Every now and then they'd call out a new type when they put it out and a rush to get edible food began as half the restaurant lurches towards the buffet.  So once you happened to get a fresh slice of pizza it honestly wasn't terrible.    They also had a "dessert" pizza that was pretty bland and kind of stale even though I supposedly got a fresh piece.  They had cinnamon rolls as well but I felt best not to chance it.  They've got a mini little game area with some arcade games and skee ball and the like, so they are definitely kid friendly.  Think of it as like a D rate Peter Piper.  Overall I'm only giving the place 2 stars because of the cheapness of the food if you happen to be able to get fresh food.

So my first experience was on opening night for this location and it was alright.  It was pretty packed, and loud, so I think I didn't talk loud enough when I placed my order and I wound up missing the lettuce and tomato on my burger.  Their bacon comes extra crispy and didn't seem like anything special.  Overall the burger was pretty decent, however I thought it'd be much better the way I ordered it and sans bacon as I'm not a crispy bacon fan.  Also I ordered the regular fries, their smallest size, and it's still a huge amount.  They fill the cup that the fries come in, then upon putting that and the burger in the bag, they dump another scoop of fries on top of the whole thing which could potentially make your burger wrapper very greasy if you were getting it to go.  On my second visit, it was much slower and my order came exactly as I ordered it with all the condiments.  This time without bacon and the addition of lettuce and tomato, it was quite an enjoyable burger.  I ordered the regular Five Guys fries this time and while still being too much to eat, they were tasty.  All in all for a pretty big burger, fries and a drink, you're looking at 10 bucks.  A couple things to note here are the amount of things you can put on the burger.  It's quite a decent selection.  Also there are boxes of peanuts with trays at the end of the checkout line that they offer for free to snack on while you eat.  Finally, they have Mello Yellow on the fountain here which may be enough to sway your descision in and of itself.  The establishment itself is quite clean and well laid out.

Text book "Hole in the Wall" Restaurant.  We started off with a appetizer of some delicious Crab Rangoons with sweet and sour sauce.  I ordered the Pad Tai on the premise that I was in the mood for something peanut-y, and while I discovered that Pad Tai isn't really my cup of tea, I could tell that this was probably a Pad Tai lover's dream dish.  Plenty of sprouts, big chunks of scrambled egg, large pieces of chicken, a pile of ground peanut stuff to mix in, and shredded cabbage and eggplant on the side to mix in as well.  It was also a literal mountain of noodles.  All for 7 dollars.  I tried a piece of my friend's Sesame Chicken and it was absolutely delicious.  Everything on the menu can be had with Chicken, Beef, Veggie, or Tofu, there might be Pork too, but I don't remember, sorry.  Also oddly enough, they have free WiFi.  Overall, prices on everything were great especially considering the heaping portion of cuisine you actually get.  Will definitely be going back.

Ok, this one has been a long time coming.   So basically my friend and I affectionately refer to these guys as the burger gods. The thing to note here, is they have a new special burger every week. If you go here, you ask for the special. If it doesn't sound like something you'd like, I'd encourage you to try it anyway. These guys do incredible, magical, delicious things with ingredients I never thought would work with a burger.   So once you've gotten your special fix in; when you go back again that week, and you probably will, they've got a slew of other finely crafted dishes. The Club sandwiches are both great in their chicken or shrimp trims. The Fresno style pork tacos are brilliant. Sides are the house's masterful take on classic burger joint sides, decadent fries, sweet potato tots, and for those with a sweet tooth, French toast fries.   Wash this all down with one of many different sodas from the fountain or the large variety of canned ones they keep in a cooler. If soda isn't your thing, fresh cucumber water is available.   For the sweeter side of things, they offer a large sampling of milkshakes and run a special flavor for a month. Fried ice cream is also on the menu but the unique flavors of milkshake offered are really the best bet.   The staff is always friendly and happy to chat. Service is usually quite fast even when busy.   If I had to say anything negative about the place it's that I've gotten burgers or sandwiches they've been missing a topping. It's only happened a couple times, and the food was still perfectly delicious otherwise.  I know with the specials that the chef does play with them a bit for fine tuning so maybe I've just caught them in that phase.   The only other negative would be that you have to go there more than once a week so you can try the special and get to try the rest of their awesome regular menu.   If you've managed to read this far I'll let you in on a little secret. The Texas BBQ burger isn't on the menu but can be ordered any time. This is my all time favorite BBQ burger ever so definitely try one.

Lemme start by saying if you are capable of slapping a burger on a grill and cooking it then you've got virtually no reason to go here. Unless you have neither a grill or ground beef.   At that point though you'd be better off going with almost any other place that has burgers. My "Double Char Cheese" double cheese burger was akin to what I used to get at my high school football games. Lettuce, tomato, pickle, mayo, and caramelized onions only really added color to the over powering taste of dry charred meat. The fries were generic lightly salted deals with nothing special. They do offer sweet potato fries that I did not try.  It wasn't horrible or inedible but I wouldn't go back. In-N-Out across the street does this classic American meal much better.
