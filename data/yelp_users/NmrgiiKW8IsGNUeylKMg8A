These guys are terrible, they claim to be the best fish tank store in town. I have bought three fish from here and they have all died. I have a professionally maintained tank and my levels are perfect. They buy wild caught fish from brokers in California and they don't acclimate them before they sell them. The owner told me its my problem The fish die not his. Take your business to anywhere but here. Petsmart has cleaner tanks.

I eat at Barros all the time all over the valley and this has to be the worst location. For lunch the lunch specials are .50 cents more than the west valley. I know it's two brothers I guess one is greedy over the other. Every time I get slices here they are always over cooked and cold. There is no quality assurance at all the other ones I goto the manager always comes by and asks how everything is this one just has some flirty girls to take your order and stand around and talk to each other instead of making sure the tables are clean in the dinning area. Eat here if you may but I wouldn't recommend it and I have tried over 10 times to get good pizza here.

After going to 4 different moon valley nurseries to buy plants and have a good experiance at all of them I would have to say this store is a very nice store with a knowledgable staff. I wanted to finish my yard behind my pool. I met with a guy named JEFF and he came out to my house have me a free in home consolation  and I took his advice and made my yard into an oasis. The guys came out and planted the job and jeff was there to make sure everything went ok.Very helpful and great service. Thanks guys!!!!

I have eaten at this location for years and by far this is the worst experiance I have ever had. We arrived and they told us it was going to he ten minutes. We were the only people waiting and when you looked at the dinning room  it was pretty empty. The food was below average and the times were horrible. With wait and after eating it took over a hour and a half. Prob won't go back.

When you wait 20 minutes in the drive through and get the wrong order it sucks. I ordered a #16 and got the totally wrong order. What's the point of drive 8 miles back the opposite direct. The chicken enchiladas sure don't taste like the cheese and a chilli relleno was what I wanted.

This hotel is nicer than most of the older hotels on the strip. I was very impressed with the room and service here. The only reason I am giving the hotel 4 stars is that it took 45 minutes to check in and the Italian food place in the hotel's portions are smaller than kids meals for $20+ a plate.

The service here is terrible, booked a room at rush tower. Park and walk up to check in and they said it's closed. The lady at was laughing at the front desk saying the girl just prob went on lunch. After walking and moving the car lost thirty minutes. Then they put me in a room facing Fremont street next to the elevator after I complained. That is terrible all I hear is the band outside. What kind of establishment is this place.

I took my girlfriend here for our anniversary dinner because we were staying at the hotel. We ate dinner here and it was bellow par than any other Italian food restaurant I have ever been to. The portions were very small and over priced. The chicken marcella for almost $30 looked like a kids menu portion. Next time I will goto Olive Garden and have better Italian food and their food isn't very good.

A piss poor ran car wash, they take forever and don't do a good job. Over priced and overrated. Don't waste your time here. Took over an hour to get my truck washed and they had it sitting in the back for 20 minutes cause my antenna wouldn't come off and no one bothered to call til after 20 minutes. People that weren't even here when I got here have already got there car washed and gone. Will not come back even if the car washes were free.

Very expensive ice cream, if you are looking for a full scoop this is not the place to go. The parking lot is always full  because there is a bar and gym in the same area. The staff is a bunch of young kids who could really care less about the customer. I used to love coming here since it's been there forever. The self serve yogurt places are going to put the old school places out of business someday.

Went here for the first time on Saturday. Extremely slow service on ordering. The old lady was very rude when we ordered. Ordered two breakfast omlette's on the same order with toast. Toast was barley toasted and one omlette came out with a bunch of cheese then the other came out with two shreds of cheese and was over cooked. It wasn't even worth bringing back if I had to put up with ladies attitude again.  Started eating it and it had egg shells in it. I will never eat at this place again. Good luck

I have been to this location twice and walked out cause no one would help me. I waited for 10 minutes no one helped me or even asked. I was trying to buy 6 subs I guess they don't need my business. Very poor management at this location. The one on hell and Tatum and Arrowhead Mall they actually care about the customers and the service. I wouldn't be surprised if this location doesn't make it. It's a shame cause the image of the company is positive except this location.

Very low quality coffee. Went here for the first time today and I won't be back. They basically copied the Dutch bros menu and changed the name. The flavor is not there compared to any other coffee place. I would put their quality bellow McDonald's. The building looks nice but other than that it's not worth going to. The girl who took my order was very pretty but had a really bad attitude.
