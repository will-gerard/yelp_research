Uprising isn't just a gym, it's a community of people that push you to be your best.  I've met so many wonderful people here.  The workouts beat anything I've ever done outside of crossfit.  I'm so happy with the constant results and gains.  I highly recommend getting your fitness on at CFU.

Really Barros. I live 5 minutes away and it takes you an hour to deliver a large pizza, wings, and a 2 liter.  Oh wait. You didnt deliver the 2 liter did you.  It was nice that you were going to send another delivery guy out to bring it.  Oh!  He never showed up.  Not that I'm pissed about the few bucks, but really?  Your service and delivery suck!
