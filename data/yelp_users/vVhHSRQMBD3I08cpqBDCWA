I have VERY mixed feelings about this place. I really really want to love it but hate walking away feeling like I was taken advantage of.   My first time there was great! I actually canceled my membership at another nail salon to start coming here. I told my friend about it and brought her in for a mani/pedi with me. I raved about the affordable prices and the relaxing atmosphere...we both left feeling sick at the crazy amounts we were charged!   I felt terrible since I had been the one saying what a great place it was....insert foot in mouth...  I asked for glitter only to be told (AFTER when I asked why my bill was so high) that the glitter was more expensive than the normal gel. I also got nail art (which is always a bit pricey anyway so I expected it to be more than normal) but when the nail tech was done she asked me "Is $55 okay???"  Is this "Let's Make a Deal"??? I laughed and responded "actually that is much higher than I was quoted," she said "okay, let's make it $52."   I don't like feeling that I am being taken for a ride. Somehow a gel mani and reg pedi cost me $100...NOT including the $20 tip..how the heck does THAT happen when I was quoted way way less. I was too embarrassed to make a scene (not my style) but did voice my concern about the price. She took off $3........  This being said I am giving them ONE more chance this evening but I will now have to ask the cost prior to getting anything done and watch every little thing they do because I feel pricing is not done consistently or honestly. My friend and I were courteous and friendly the entire time and as a result we were taken for a ride when it comes to pricing...  Am I crazy to walk back in here? Most likely, but if they do a decent job I will gladly update my review...Like I said, I WANT to love this place.

Well. as promised I am updating my review!   I did have better luck this time (though I asked what everything would cost as we went along...) and will be back. My advice is to just make sure that you ASK the cost before saying yes to anything. Also, they do have wine but if you don't know that going in, you might not get it. Seems like they never mention it or offer a glass so just speak up and ask for one and you'll be all set.

Great food and service. Went there this past weekend with my boyfriend and his mother and we all loved our food. Their sides are fantastic. I would definitely recommend checking it out.

I had the SAME experience as Stephanie N. with the same hair dresser! I think her name was Colee? She turned my blond hair several tones including purple and orange (NOT a good look).   I was there THREE hours and she burned the heck out of my hair and scalp by bleaching it THREE times!!!!!! My scalp is red and in pain today (this took place last night). When I called this morning thankfully the woman on the phone seemed very understanding and said she would have it fixed (by someone else) for free...My guess is she knows that Codee has done this before....  The damage has already been done to my hair, it's brittle and all sorts of messed up so who knows. I am headed in to see what they can do after work. (yes, I am now at work with orange and lavender hair).   This is NOT acceptable. I still tipped her 20% (I felt bad because she tried but clearly has no idea what she is doing) so now I am out $100 dollars, have a burned scalp and HORRIBLE looking, damaged hair.   At this point I want my hair fixed and my money back...I'll update after I have it "fixed" this evening.  UPDATE - After talking to the owner (Julie) and having her go out of her way to make sure things were fixed, I have a whole new appreciation for this place. She made sure she was there to see my hair and discuss options with me, gave me a bottle of treatment to undo the damage to my hair and paired me with an absolutely awesome stylist (Molly). She made sure I was 100% happy and really put all her effort in to fixing the damage. I will be going back to her for sure! I love love love my hair, too bad I ended up with Colee the first time. Molly was much more professional and friendly and she now has a new and happy client.   Thanks Julie and Molly for fixing the mess! I no longer look like a school bus for the holidays! phew

Was excited to check this place out but the excitement didn't last long. Bar staff was extremely rude to my friends and I and the customers were no better. Apparently if you are under 50 there you don't belong. This is like a sad retirement home birthday party. Very depressing

Food is terrific and the outdoor patio is the best seat in the house if you can reserve it :)

This is a great break from the normal Scottsdale scene. The bar staff is friendly, the pizza is fantastic (which is a lot coming from a New Yorker ;-) ) and the crowd is diverse and fun. A hidden gem in the Kierland area for sure!

HORRIBLE PLACE! Treated like a complete idiot since I am not only a woman but in my 20s. When I first went with my father they were pleasant but the second I came alone they wouldn't even tell me what the price of the car was. Now who would buy a vehicle without knowing what is costs?

Manager Glen is less than helpful...I called to cancel my membership and he was rude and continued to tell me that I needed to come in to cancel for my security...he even cited some stupid reason like "what if someone is having a breakup and their ex cancels their membership?" Ummmm what? I told him I would gladly photocopy my license and send along with my signature and he continued to say that wasn't allowed.  After asking for corporate's number, I called and had NO PROBLEM canceling it over the phone. No need for identification, no need to sign away my life in blood....Dear Glen, try being helpful on the phone. I will even write a script for you to use if that may benefit you.  Customer: I would like to cancel my membership You: I'm sorry to hear that. You can come in to the gym to cancel OR, if you would prefer, you may call this number to cancel by phone - 866-308-8179 Customer: Thanks!  See how easy it is? You too can be a great manager if you get off your high horse and use some manners :)

Yesterday while asking a hostess for a table, a rude man cut me off and jumped in front of me. I kindly say "excuse me sir, we are being helped." When he doesn't respond I say again "excuse me?" He looks at me and says "I have this problem, when stupid people speak I don't hear them..."   He then proceeded to yell at me about my "fake hair" because god forbid I have roots right now ( getting my hair done Tuesday by the way) he then proceeds to scream in my face and swear at me...I stand up for myself as other customers looked on in horror. He continues swearing and screaming in my face.   Is this the restaurants fault? Certainly NOT. The way the manager handled it however is. This man should have been asked to leave after verbally assaulting me. Instead, he was given a table and I was told nothing could be done because the fight was "mutual." MUTUAL??? Are you joking? Ask any of the people who witnessed it what they thought. Other customers ran up to me to make sure I was okay.   This manager defended a verbally abusive man but I guess that should be expected in Scottsdale. So I was supposed to allow someone to scream in my face while saying NOTHING!? Dear manager, do you have no woman in your life that you care about? A mother, wife, daughter, sister etc? What would you say to them in this situation?  I once was a weekly visitor for their great happy hour. I will now continue to tell everyone to avoid this place. Several of my friends are now boycotting it.   I have contacted Sam Fox and so far no response.  P.S. After ALL this they mess up my order.....I specifically tell them no meat on my pizza since I am a vegetarian...yet I am served a pizza full off pepperoni. Glasses of water sat empty for 30 minutes and service was terrible.

After several bad hair experiences I was thrilled to find this place :) Blonde hair can be tricky (as anyone who has bleached for a prolonged period knows). Sometimes it can take on a strange orange tone or other odd not-so-desirable hues. Not the case here! Paul did my hair perfectly and the price is totally fair.   I recommend this place to anyone looking for a great stylist! Oh and I can't forgot to mention that you can have a beer while you get pampered...pretty cool. right?

Where do I begin? I came in for the first time last Friday with my boyfriend to celebrate our anniversary and everything from the atmosphere to the food and service were amazing. We added the wine pairing option and were not disappointed. Our server was knowledgeable, professional and friendly. The courtyard is amazing and very romantic. I will definitely be returning!

I absolutely love Compound Grill. I have been coming here since they opened and it just seems to be getting better and better. The staff is friendly, the music is great and the food is fantastic.   It's a great place for a happy hour date or a large dinner with friends. If you haven't been here yet I recommend check it out and you will be hooked like me!

I can't say enough how much I looooooove 20 Lounge! Not only is it super clean (I am a bit of a germaphobe) but it's a beautiful salon.   The staff is warm and welcoming and Debbie does an amazing job on my nails each and every time. I am hooked and love going every 2 weeks for my mani. Pedicures are heavenly there as well. The icing on the cake is the fact that I can relax with a glass of wine while being pampered. I have been to many Scottsdale area nail places but 20 Lounge is the only place I go now.

I still absolutely LOVE Debbie and the rest of the great ladies there but the new policies are really driving away customers. The price increase now makes this an expense that no longer makes sense. To make matters worse, I went to book online today only to be greeted by a new policy that now says if you don't cancel within 24 hours you will be charged FULL PRICE! I typically go on my lunch break and occasionally have something come up at work that makes me need to reschedule. I could see if it was $5 or something but the owners really need to rethink their sales strategy.... You are driving away the core of your business with insane pricing and ridiculous policies.   Canceling my membership and sadly headed elsewhere :(

As I write this I am crying. I have never been treated with such disrespect. I closed out my tab after one beer and nothing was said. My boyfriend was laughed at when he ordered a water and said he was driving and the older woman serving us said "this is a bar" and sneered at him. I later decided to reopen my tab for one shot and was told I couldn't because it cost them money to reopen my tab. I tried to reason them and was called a bitch by the manager. I then went to the bouncer who swiftly kicked me out while the manager laughed. This used to be my favorite place but no one told me there was a 10 dollar minimum or I would have kept my tab open. I am swiftly reporting them to the better business bureau and contacting the owner as soon as possible.

I was very excited to check this place out but was unfortunately really disappointed in the experience. I went with friends this past weekend and while I expected it to be busy, I had no idea it would be as packed as it was.   We went on the wait list at 7:30 for a lane and were told it should be an hour and a half, we were happy with that and went to get some food and drinks. Our waitress took 6 orders without writing anything down, when we said "wow that is amazing you can remember all that" she quickly told us how wonderful her memory is...we were all impressed....until we got our orders. Of the 6, 3 were messed up and when we nicely asked for things to be fixed she rolled her eyes and was very nasty.   I worked in food service for years and believe that even if you are annoyed, you should never let the customer know that and NEVER roll your eyes in front of them. So after we got all that squared away and were 2 hours into our wait for a lane, we were told it would be at least another hour to bowl....lesson learned. We will not be back to Lucky Strike. The atmosphere was really cool but the service was so poor that it is not worth making the trip there for mediocre food and service with an attitude.

Absolutely love Citizen, not only is the food phenomenal but the service is top tiered! Every time I go I always sit in Sam's section. He's so knowledgeable about the food and wine that it makes the evening A +

I am the self proclaimed queen of quesadillas and was super excited to try out this place this afternoon when we had our weekly food truck Wednesday at the office.   I must say, I am not disappointed. In fact, the papa verde is even better than I thought it would be! The staff was really sweet and when I got back to the office I realized mine had chicken in it (was supposed to be vegetarian) a co-worker bought it from me and I went back over the get it remade. They wouldn't even let me pay for the new one! So nice of them. If there is one thing I totally appreciate, it's great customer service....wellllll that AND great food. This place has the perfect combo of both.

This place is great! The staff is super friendly, instruments are clean and it has a great atmosphere.   P.S. I love the wine as well :)    (My initial rating was 5 stars)  UPDATE - As much as I love this place, I am a bit worried about the cleanliness after going a few times. The nail grinder used for acrylics is apparently not cleaned after each use (or even once a day for that matter). After having the file cause slight bleeding (not uncommon) I asked how often they were sanitized and was very disturbed to hear NEVER....I hate leaving them since they are great but unless they begin sanitizing EVERYTHING, I will not be going there anymore...

Leslie is awesome. I was nervous about getting extensions (but have always wanted them) and she did a great job of answering my questions and making the experience a comfortable and good one. She has a great sense of humor and is fun to talk to.  I am hooked! I get tons of compliments and totally love how they simplify my beauty routine in the morning (no more mascara)!    I have already recommended her to many of my friends. If you have ever thought about getting eyelash extensions, go to her. She is simply the best!

If you haven't had the make-your-own macaroni and cheese, you are missing out. Was a bit nervous going to a cheeseburger place as a vegetarian, but was pleasently surprised at the selection. I always recommend this place to my friends when we are in Old Town.

Went here for the first time today and loved everything about it! From the decor to the food and service, it was everything I hoped for and then some. I recommend the twisted noodle salad. It comes with chicken or steak but I had no problem ordering it on the side since I am a vegetarian. My boyfriend split the salad with me and said the steak was great.   Also, try the cauliflower grits. They are fantastic!
