I've been attending performances at The Phoenix Theatre for over 10-years now and was a season ticket holder for several years. My wife has been going nearly her whole life, her grandfather performed in plays and her mother is a current board member of the organization. As I was in town this past weekend, my in-laws got us tickets to see the current show, Avenue Q, which was great!  Over the years we have attended numerous shows including Chicago, Man of La Mancha, Fried Green Tomatoes, How To Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, The Producers, Into the Woods, Arsenic and Old Lace, Picnic, and many others.  While its not the place to see experimental theater or cutting-edge new dramas, Phoenix Theatre presents a mix of familiar musicals and dramatic shows each season and does a great job with them. In fact many of the musicals are better than the touring Broadway shows that come to Gammage.  The theater itself is located in the Phoenix Art Museum complex, and while its not large, every seat in the house has a good view of the stage. Parking is free and readily available and with shows typically starting at 8:00 pm, its easy to get a nice bite to eat before the show.  Prices for shows are also reasonable and season tickets are a great deal for the amount of entertainment you receive.  In short, Phoenix is lucky to have a performing arts organization of this quality and I'd encourage anyone who likes live theater to be sure and check it out.

This is one of my favorite places to go before a D-Backs or Suns game. Sure it's pricey, but the food is worth it. Definitely better than your standard sports fare of wings, potato skins and burgers. It actually is a place where you can get a nice meal and a few drinks before heading to the game.

Despite being around for 20 years now, US Airways Center remains a great place to see a game, concert, or other special event.  I've been here numerous times over the years and always had a great time. Most recently I attended the Fleetwood Mac concert and before that a Suns-Pacers Game.  There's really not a bad seat in the house, restrooms and food are conveniently located throughout the building and while the ladies room often has a line at the end of an event, when everyone is leaving at once, according to my wife, its generally not too bad.  Unlike other cities that built arenas on the cheap and now have to shell out hundreds of millions of dollars to build new arenas or risk losing their team (cough, cough, Sacramento), Phoenix should be proud that US Airways Center was built right to begin with and the City has continued to maintain and make improvements throughout its history.   Now if the Suns can just turn things around...

I get that hotel gift shops tend to overcharge, but seriously, over $3 for a bottle of Coke that 's not even 20oz, but rather only 16.9? That's ridiculous! If you're a guest at this hotel, It's well worth your time to walk across the street to buy a soda at the convenience store.  Also I was here for a conference and although we were in the conference rooms at times the noise of hotel staff moving plates and other equipment in the service corridors next to us was so loud it almost drowned out the conference speaker.  I cannot recommend this hotel.

Love this zoo! We come here for Zoo Lights, my kids attend zoo camp and we visit for fun family outings. The new orangutang and komodo dragon exhibits are tremendous and the monkey exhibit and giraffe station are a blast as well. The splash pads and water cave are great ways to cool off after walking around in the Arizona Sun.  One word of advice though, bring your own food and drinks as prices at the Zoo concession stands are fairly ridiculous, $6 for a hot dog? I don't think so!  Overall though, the Phoenix Zoo is great family fun and one of my favorite spots in the Valley.

It looks like a hole-in-the-wall liquor store, but it has an excellent selection of craft beer and sodas. Plus, they allow you to put together your own six-pack of various types so you can try all sorts of new drinks. And if you're in to liquor, they have a large selection of that as well. If you're in the area, this is a place to go.

It's a Costco so it's pretty much what you'd expect. Food, clothes, household supplies, sporting goods, automotive, vitamins, medications, etc. They also have a gas station and the food court where you can get pizza, hot dogs, chicken bakes, or churros.  The only downside to this Costco is that it seems to have a larger than usual Senior Citizen clientele. Now I have nothing against seniors as I'm nearly one myself, but they do have a tendency to walk slowly and leave their carts blocking aisles. So if you want to run in quickly and grab one item, as I recently did, this may be an issue.  Overall, it's a Costco and it's a great place to shop.

I've been here quite a few times over the year and on my most recent visit I noticed that the food and service have really gone downhill.  Macayo's claim to fame is that it's founder, Woody Johnson, invented the chimichanga by accidentally dropping a burrito into the deep frier. However, as any good Arizonan knows, this claim is challenged by El Charro restaurant in Tucson where they also claim to have invented the dish in the same year.  Either way, you'd think that a restaurant that wants to lay claim to such an important event in food history would make an effort to maintain its reputation as a quality Mexican restaurant, but this doesn't seem to be the case.  We stopped in the other night and started with some cheese quesadillas for us and the kids and they were incredibly bland and boring.   For a main course, my wife had the steak picado and I had the green chile chicken picado. My dish is described on the menu as "tender chunks of marinated chicken sauteed in a fiery blend of tomatillo salsa, strips of poblano chiles and habanero". Nowhere does it say, cooked beyond recognition so that the chicken tastes like dry pieces of cardboard.  My wife's steak picado was not tender, but tough.  Additionally, our service was inattentive when it occurred and non-existent at other times. I never received the sour cream I requested and once the food was at our table and the waitress had left behind a pitcher of water so we could do our own refills, we didn't see her again despite the fact that several members of our party had ice tea and could have used refills.  In a city and state full of GOOD Mexican restaurants, you'd think that Macayo's would try harder to compete, but I guess not. If it's my choice, I won't be back.

This is a small AJ's, but really its the closest thing you're going to find in Central Phoenix to a specialty, gourmet market like Dean & DeLuca or another old-school independent market.   I wouldn't shop here for staples, but they have an excellent selection of items you can't find elsewhere, plus prepared food, wine, spirits, cheeses, etc.  Plus, if I drank coffee this looks like a place I would want to sit out front and have a cup on a regular basis.

I'm giving 5-stars to this Walgreen's for the exemplary service I received at the drive-through pharmacy today.  First of all, let me say that my pharmacy experience is colored by the typically lousy experience I get at the Fry's Marketplace pharmacy near my house. In the case of Fry's, they typically ignore you when you come to the window, take 40-minutes to fill any prescription - even something that's in a box and all they have to do is pull it off the shelf. I've even had them take 40-minutes and then tell me that they were out of the medicine and I needed to go to another store.  Enough about Fry's - eventually I'll write a review of them - and back to today's tremendous experience at Walgreen's.  Because my in-law's are currently out of town, I agreed to pick up a prescription for my wife's grandmother and deliver it to her nursing home. My mother-in-law told me that I could just go through the drive-through and get it. Unfortunately, when I got there it turned out the refill had never been ordered.   Luckily, the pharmacist looked in the computer, determined the needed medication, put in the refill and told me it would be ready in 20-minutes.  I took my kids to run another errand and then came back to the store. When we came back to the drive-through, the first pharmacist still couldn't find the prescription in the system. However, instead of giving me the brush-off, as the would have at Fry's, she went and found the pharmacist I had talked with 20-minutes earlier. As it so happened, that pharmacist was in the midst of filling the prescription and they had the medication to me in less than 5-minutes.  Despite the fact that Fry's is just around the corner, I may be transferring the family prescriptions to Walgreen's. It's a nice change to deal with people who actually make the extra effort and who seem to care,

I'll go see movies like Iron Man, Thor, The Dark Knight and X-Men, but I am no fanboy and I did not spend much of my youth nor any of my adult life reading comic books.   That being said, now that my 8-year-old is really getting into reading and also enjoying playing his Lego Batman game on the Wii, I decided it was time to find him some books to learn more about Batman and the assorted villains he faces in the game. I remembered a Batman encyclopedia I had read as a kid at the library and went to see if anything similar still existed.   The workers at the store were very happy to show me what they have available and even give me other suggestions within the same type of reading level.   I ended up getting a book entitled "Batman: The Ultimate Guide to the Dark Knight" and a collection of Batman: Brave and the Bold comics from the youth section.   My son was excited with his birthday presents and I was very happy with the service I received at the store. Definitely recommended.

My in-laws are members here, I've been here for Rotary Club meetings, United Way and YMCA Board events, my kids took swim lessons here and swam on the club swim team, and we recently held a fundraising dinner for my kids' school here. Throughout all of this I have never had a bad experience at the Phoenix Country Club.   Whether you're a member, a guest, or just a visitor, the staff at the Phoenix Country Club treat you like a VIP. However, its not snobbish or snooty, just competency that comes through.  Also, its always been nice, but the renovation that was completed a few years ago really has made this club step up. If you want to visit one of the best places in Phoenix, check out the Phoenix Country Club.

I recently cleaned out my closet, picked a bunch of items that I thought would do well at Buffalo and took them in to see what type of credit I would get. The young man took my box of clothing, went through them all without saying a word to me and then told me "I can't take any of this."  WTF? The clothing was in great shape, included some A&F shirts, surf and skater gear, designer jeans, etc... and he couldn't use any of it? I understand that times are tight right now, but it really seemed as if my clothes were rejected beacause I didn't have the right look, wasn't wearing a shirt from the latest alternative group or didn't have enough piercings. I didn't say anything, just took my clothes to the Tempe location where they ended up taking nearly half of them. This experience has really soured me on the Missouri location of this chain.

We hadn't been to Texaz in about ten years, so we thought it would be fun to take the kids last weekend. It's still crowded and with the animals, posters, newspaper articles on the walls and hundreds of ballcaps hanging from the ceiling, the atmosphere at Texaz is a genuine version of the type of place that chain restaurants pay designers big money to create. For kids, its a cornucopia of sights and sounds to look at which accounts for the two stars I'm giving it.  However, it doesn't get any more stars because the food has really gone downhill. Naturally my wife and I ordered the meal that this restaurant is famous for - chicken-fried steak with mashed potatoes and gravy and as I said, we hadn't been there in about ten years, but there is no way the food used to be this bland. Unfortunately, this was one of the most boring chicken-fried steaks I have ever had. The breading had no flavor and the gravy didn't add any either. I like good chicken fried steak, but this wasn't it. In fact, I'd be embarrassed to bring anyone from Texas to this place.  Sorry Texaz, I know you're a Central Phoenix institution, but you're riding on past glory.

OK, after visiting a few more times I've decided to increase my ranking. Yes, they are true runners but I've been in enough times now that I've realized that they are just sharing their passion for the sport and not trying to be elitist or intimidating. Plus it's the closest running store to my house, its an institution in the Valley running scene, and I really do like supporting local businesses. If you haven't been there lately, Runner's Den is definitely worth another look.

I'm a believer! This is truly one of the best running stores around. Yes, it seemed a bit intimidating to me at first, but now that I have been around more often I've realized that I really like this store. Right now I'm training for my first half marathon and to do so I went ahead and joined the Runners Den Training Group. It's a well designed program that is fun, but will get me to the point of running 13.1 miles by the date of the race. And while I'm still not fast, I'm getting my endurance back.  Also, I was starting to get black toenails from my previous shoes, that I picked out myself, and when I went in to the store they measured me and noted that I needed to go up another 1/2 size to allow for feet swelling on long runs.   Plus, it's a locally owned store, which means that while it might not have all the giveaways, marketing, and glitz of the big chain running stores, it does mean that you will get personal attention and care from people who not only know their stuff, but are runners themselves.  There's a reason that Runner's Den has been around since 1974 and hopefully will be around for many more years!

They do a good job for a full service car wash but I hate all the upselling. I don't really care that you will sell me a full-on detailing for half the normal price because at $150 that's not all that much different than what I could pay elsewhere.   Once in a while I'm willing to come in and spend $20+ for a full service wash that not only gets the exterior, but also includes vacuuming and cleaning of the interior. But with all the high pressure sales I'm always reminded why I prefer to go to the self-serve places that only cost me between $5-7.  I'll probably be back at some point, but definitely not on a regular basis.. and sorry dude, I'm not spending that much to have my car detailed.

Finally decided to check this out recently. Great atmosphere, great food, and great drinks. I'm not sure what can be said that is not found in other reviews, but Rokerij is very good. It's a grill, so vegetarians might not find it too their liking, but others will enjoy their evening. If you're looking for a nice place to eat or drink, check it out.

If you want a genuine Italian restaurant experience, L'Amore is as good as it gets! It reminds me of places I've been in New York or San Francisco. We had a large party with my wife's parents. my brother-in-law, his husband, and our kids, but that wasn't a problem for them at all.  In fact, the service was excellent and extremely friendly from our waiter and even the owner coming by to check on us. The selection of food was excellent and everybody enjoyed their food. I had the cioppino, my kids split a chicken piccatta, and my wife had the chicken marsala. Others had various options. I highly recommend this place for an evening out, and you don't even need to wait for a special occasion, just go if you want a good meal and an enjoyable night.

We started going here after the vets at Alta Vista matter-of-factly suggested that we should put our kitten down without suggesting other options. Turned out she just needed some medication and a little time and now she is a perfectly happy four-year-old cat.   This past Saturday our 14-year-old male cat started acting strange, throwing up, meowing in pain, and trying to hide. He's already in Stage 2 Kidney Disease so we feared this could be the end. I called Squaw Peak Animal Hospital and even though they had no appointments available, they said if we got there right away, they would get a doctor to see us. We hurried over, and when we got there they put us in a room and within a few minutes the veterinarian was in to see us. Luckily, he immediately determined that the issues were not related to the kidney disease but instead a gastrointestinal issue of some sort. They gave our cat a shot to ease the stomach issue and rehydrate him, cleaned him up, and let us take him home. A day later, after sleeping and regaining his strength, my cat seems to be getting back to normal.  If you're looking for a veterinary office that understands and values the relationship you have with your pet, Squaw Peak is the way to go. They've treated us great every time we've come in and will even make the effort to get you in when its an emergency.  Highly recommended!

Why pay full price for men's clothing when you can find quality used items here? Well Suited consistently has an excellent selection of suits, sportcoats, slacks, dress shirts and golf shirts. You can also trade in your old clothing for store credit or cash. The credit is good at any of the different stores in the My Sister's Closet chain, including all of their stores that carry men's and women's clothes, furniture and kid's apparel, furniture and toys.

When one kid wanted a short and spiky haircut and the other wants to keep it longer like Justin Bieber, I realized that going to my regular barber might not be the best move, so we checked out Supercuts. Even walking in without an appointment they were able to get both boys in the chairs within 10 minutes and we were out of there in half an hour. Both of the boys came out looking great and they were both very happy with the haircuts they received. I would definitely recommend this location, especially if you have kids who need haircuts.

Overpriced!  They don't clean your clothes any better than any other cleaners, but you pay for the convenience of the drive-up service.  Unless there's some reason that you can't get out of your car, I'd advise driving past this place and taking the time to walk in somewhere else.

In 1997, Steamers was where I went out to dinner with the lovely lady who is now my wife....  In 1999 on New Year's Eve (Y2K), Steamers is where I dropped to one knee and proposed to the same lady....  And in 2001, Steamers is where my wife and I got a bite to eat after our wedding reception - since we were too busy talking to everyone at the reception to actually eat.  So when my in-laws suggested Steamers as a place to celebrate my recent birthday, I gladly accepted.  After going, I think perhaps we should find a new place.  The restaurant still looks the same and the ambiance is fine, but the food is tired and boring.  For the price you are paying, you'd expect really good food, but instead it was all just kind of blah. The service was fine although the waiter didn't really seem to know much about the menu and I hate it when they deliver the food and have to ask who ordered what - isn't there supposed to be some sort of a system whereby they keep track of who ordered what at the table?   The calamari was overly breaded and rubbery, the spicy shrimp wasn't very spicy. My jambalaya was soupy and had too many vegetables and not enough seafood or sausage. My wife's steak was OK, but did not compare to what can be found at many steakhouses. Even the oysters on the half shell were just there, nothing special.  The one highlight of the meal was the ice-cream, brownie thing they brought for my birthday.  All in all, not enough positives to go back. I think we'll find a new place for future special events.

Reasonably priced tailor shop when you need alterations done quickly. Apparently, they can also make custom suits, but my experiences have been with having pants hemmed, waistbands taken both in and out, and having jacket sleeves lengthened.  Generally, your work will be done in a week or less. There are a number of people working here, so you get whoever is free but I've been happy with everyone I've had.   One thing I somewhat dislike is that even thought they do have changing rooms, they will often do simple alterations without having you try on the item. Luckily, the estimates have, so far, been right on the money.  Oh, and its cash only, so hit an ATM before you go.

I've been getting my old car fixed up and one of the things I decided to do was replace the blown speakers in the back. I found Sun Valley Stereo on Yelp and all of the great reviews are true. They recommended a pair of Pioneer Speakers that were reasonably priced and told me they could install them in about an hour. Actually, they were done in less than 45 minutes and once again my stereo sounds great.  If you need me, I'll be the guy with my windows rolled down, cranking the tunes!

Great, casual alternative to Vincent's on Camelback with the same quality food and service at a lower price point.  Similar to his Sunday Farmer's Market, Vincent Guerithault is continuing in his mission of bringing authentic French food to Phoenix. While formal French dining often has the reputation of being expensive and stuffy, everyday eating in France is not like this and Vincent's Market Bistro brings that traditional, French country dining style to the fore.  We were there with my in-laws, our kids, and my brother-in-law and his boyfriend and we were certainly not the youngest group there. In fact, there was another table composed entirely of kids from St. Francis elementary school and Brophy / Xavier high schools.  You have the choice of a prix fixe menu for $25 or individual items, but nothing is too expensive.   We started with appetizers including the smoked salmon quesadilla, the tomato and mozarella salad, and even introduced the kids to escargot, which they liked!  For the main course, I had the coq au vin and others had the duck confit, four cheese ravioli, wood fired pizzas, and beef bourguignon. Everyone enjoyed their meals and service was excellent.   As we finished up, our server, unprompted by us, brought out a selection of complimentary desserts that everyone enjoyed.  If you're looking for a nice, affordable, evening on the town with great food and great service, head over to Vincent's Market Bistro and you'll leave feeling like you've just spent a great evening in the South of France.

This location started out as The Q, has been around for a couple of decades and unfortunately is showing its age.   I considered giving just one star, but it does seem like they've finally started to update this place by doing stuff like removing the unnecessary upstairs desk and replacing all of the old TVs with modern flat screens.  However, they still need to go a lot further. I wish they would just close down for a week, completely clean, and repaint the entire place with a new color scheme that doesn't give me flashbacks to the 90s. They also need to fix the tile in the sauna and improve the lighting throughout so it doesn't seem so dingy.  Either that or just tear the place down and build a whole new gym.  Honestly, if it wasn't for Mickey's Thursday night yoga class I'm not sure I'd make the effort to come to this location.

Great little hidden nature center in South Phoenix. Located right at Central and the South Bank of the Salt Riverbed, they offer nature trails, educational exhibits, and special events. You can learn about the riparian area, natural plants and animals. We've also been here for Halloween costume events and the Cub Scout District Pinewood Derby Championships. While some people may worry about the location, they shouldn't, this is a great fun place to visit.

I've been visiting V's on and off since they first opened in 1999. For a while I thought that I needed to pay a Scottsdale stylist big bucks to cut my hair but as I get older I've come back to the realization that a good barber is all I need.  I'm not sure why I ever strayed because I've never had a bad haircut at V's. I've gotten a shave here as well, although I tend to think a straight razor shave is overrated, and I also really appreciate the fact that they offer a shoeshine service. In fact I've stopped in many times just to have a polish put on when I'm headed to an interview or an important meeting.  Currently I'm working in California so I only get back to Phoenix about one weekend a month, but if I can make it work, I try and hit up V's to get my haircut.  Today I took my two boys with me so we could all get our haircuts. As always the atmosphere was great and the service was excellent. It's fun to see all the other fathers with their sons and I know that when I move back to Arizona permanently this will become a regular event for my children and I.  If you need a great place to get your haircut, get a shave, get your shoes shined or just to hang out with the guys, head over to V's - you won't regret it!

I've been using them for seven years and this is quite simply the best flower shop in the Valley.  I first used Camelback Flower Shop not long after they opened in 2003. When you've just had a billionaire's wife open her Paradise Valley home for a charity event that you conceived and sponsored, she deserves better than the standard arrangement found at many shops. I stopped in the shop and they took the time to talk with me, find out why I was sending flowers and promised me they'd come up with something amazing.  According to the thank you card I received a few days later from our hostess, they succeeded.  Since 2003, I have not ordered flowers from anywhere else and since the majority (OK - all) of the deliveries have gone to my wife, I've had the opportunity to see the arrangements in person and even though I still can't tell a rose from a daffodil from a baby's breath, I remain impressed everytime.  Currently, I am working in Sacramento, CA while my wife and children remain in Phoenix.. Before I left I set up an account and now all I have to do is call and they will design something amazing and deliver it for me. They even remember me when I call. It sure beats sending one of those run-of-the-mill FTD arrangements.  You'd think with all this personal service and great design that Camelback Flower Shop would be expensive, but they really aren't. From what I've seen, the prices are in-line with most other florists. Its just that they do a better job and provide a better service.  So, with apologies to Hallmark, when you really care enough to send the very best, send flowers using Camelback Flower Shop.

I buy all of my tires at Discount Tire and my recent experience here just reminded me why. I noticed on Saturday morning that I had a nail stuck in the sidewall of my tire and decided that before waking up on Monday morning with a flat I'd better get it taken care of right away. Because the nail was in the sidewall, the tire had to be replaced, not repaired. However, because I always purchase the replacement certificates with my tires, it only cost me $20 for a brand new Pirelli tire. As always at Discount Tire, service was outstanding and my tire was done and car ready within 45 minutes.   Discount Tire, I am a lifelong customer!

Dude, did you really turn to a co-worker and say, "you take this order, I don't have the patience to wait for this" while my 9-year-old was trying to tell you what he wanted on his sandwich? There were no other customers in the store at the time other than me and my children, so I'm not sure if you just woke up on the wrong side of the bed, or if you somehow mistakenly think that your job doesn't involve serving people no matter how long it takes to place the order.  Major customer service fail.

I've shopped at this and other Sports Authority locations many times and I am usually very happy with what I find. Excellent selection of clothing and gear for good prices. This location is not as large as the one at Mesa Riverview, but it has a good choice of stuff. Recently we found my wife a new pair of Rollerblades here and I have picked up other items in the past.  Don't forget to use the Yelp Check-in feature as it gives you $10 off purchases of $50 or more.

Dropped in recently to return some Rollerblades I'd bought my wife for Christmas and see if there was another pair she would like better. The extent of the customer service was them directing us to the shelf where the skates are located but obviously the guy doing that knew nothing about the different brands or models and didn't even want to help looking for sizes as he walked away and quickly went back to his conversation about the NFL playoffs with another employee.   Also, because it's Big 5 they have a very limited selection of styles and once my wife tried on a few we decided just to return that pair and look elsewhere. We ended up purchasing a new pair at Sports Authority instead.

Dillard's is my favorite department store out there and while its not as big as the store at Scottsdale Fashion Square, this location actually seems to have a better selection of men's clothing. Every time I come here I'm impressed with the choices I find and the service I receive.  Plus, like all Dillard's, the prices are reasonable and the sales are excellent.  I highly recommend this location.

We go to this Papa John's all the time. Service has always been quick and friendly. The one time they messed up the order, I called and they immediately gave a coupon for a free pizza to make it up.  IMHO Papa John's is the best chain pizza out there - much better than Domino's, Pizza Hut, or Little Caesar's (although any pizza is always good).  The only drawback is that delivery can take up to 45 minutes and since the store is less than 10 minutes from my house, I always do carryout.  But, if you're in the area and craving pizza, I recommend this Papa John's.

A great breakfast and lunch spot in an unlikely location - hidden in an industrial strip. I used to work right around the corner and this is where we always took our clients and had our company lunches. The salads, sandwiches and soups are great. Everything on the menu is homemade and delicious. My favorite items on the menu are the Roast Beef Avocado Melt, Pecan Honey Dijon Salad, Cream of Spinach and Artichoke Soup, Chicken Tortilla Soup. If you're in the area, drop in.

One of the best places in town to take the kids and spend a nice family day. In the summer the playground area is shaded and during the rest of the year the entire park is a blast. For just a couple of bucks you can ride one of the two railroads or the carousel or tour the Presidential dining car. And if you don't want to spend any money, play on the playground, around the fort, or go see the giant model railroad displays.  You can also get ice cream and snacks at the snack bar and there is an excellent selection of train toys available for purchase. The park is even a great place to hold a birthday party and during the winter riding the train through the holiday light displays that they set up is nearly as good as Zoo Lights.  All in all, the McCormick-Stillman Railroad Park is a great place for kids or those who are still kids at heart.

Chompie's has far and away the best bagels in town. Not the cardboard-tasting, dry, processed junk you get at Einstein's. Chompie's actually taste like the good bagels you get in New York. Plus, they're still the only place in town that sells salt bagels and they're kosher. Unfortunately, it only gets 4 out of 5 stars because it's too pricey and the dining room is pretty boring.

I'm a fan of V's and while I normally go to the original location on Indian School, I decided to give this location a shot the other day. It's a very nice shop located at Kierland Commons and if I had a regular barber here I would probably be happy, but since I don't I walked in and just took whoever was available, which is where I take a little issue with the service.  I mean, I know that this is a barber shop, not a hairstylist and I don't expect to have a long conversation about hairstyles, but when I tried to explain what I want, my guy's first question was about the setting I wanted on the clippers, i.e. "Did I want a 3 or a 4?" Umm, really? If I knew what setting was what I would probably be a barber myself, but since I'm not I think its his job to figure out which settings to use.  Despite that, I was very happy with the way the haircut came out and I would certainly recommend this place. I just hope the barber's keep in mind that not everyone has the same knowledge they do. That's why we pay them for their skills.

Going to the roller skating rink is old fashioned, good clean fun. We've been here for school events and birthday parties and always had a great time. Even when they messed up and took forever to deliver the pizza at my 7-year-olds birthday they made up for by giving us free passes and tokens to use on our return.  If you've got kids, or just want to feel like one again, and especially when its too hot to go outside, head on over to Great Skate and get your workout in while having a great time!

For decades I've heard stories about the pies at Rock Springs and last weekend I finally had the chance to stop. It's a cute little Western themed tourist trap and there looks to be a lot to check out, but we just went in and ordered a Chocolate Cream Pie to go. The pies are pricey, but hey, that's what made them famous... and when we got home and tried it, it was delicious!  This is definitely a place that lives up to the hype, just be careful in the parking lot as its pretty small and I saw a few near collisions just in the time we were there.

Yum, yum, yum!!!  I've heard about this place for years and recently had the chance to give it a try. Wow, some of the best fried chicken I've ever had combined perfectly with crispy waffles and topped off with syrup and LoLo's own hot sauce.   Service was very friendly and the facility was really nice, very welcoming and comfortable. Yes, you have to drive a little further South on Central Avenue than some people find comfortable, but its well worth it.  If you're looking for great comfort food, give LoLo's a shot!

Great casual burger restaurant and bar that caters to the downtown Phoenix crowd, Encanto golf course and neighborhood and students from Phoenix College along with St. Mary's and Brophy Prep High School students. Go in for lunch on a weekend and you'll find numerous golfers cooling off after a round on the links and on Friday nights during high school football season you'll see families getting a bite before Brophy Games at the Phoenix College stadium.  The burgers are big and juicy and with the condiment bar you can add whatever toppings you like. The french fries are thick and seasoned well. My wife loves the ham steak sandwich and the kids like the choice of hamburgers, hot dogs or chicken fingers.  The decor is like an old-fashioned tavern with gas station and other kitschy decorations overlooking wood benches and tables. The TV's usually have ESPN or some sporting events on and you can also sit at the bar or on the patio when the weather permits.  As a whole, the restaurant is very reminiscent of the Chuck Box in Tempe and the Monastery that used to be at 28th and Indian School. A great casual atmosphere to get eats and drinks without the pretension found at some of the new upscale burger joints in town.  Good food for a great price!

Why go to some new place that tries to recreate the ambiance of an old fashioned ice cream parlor when you can just go to an actual old-fashioned ice cream parlor? Unlike newer parlors, Mary Coyle's doesn't try to be self-referentially hip or ironic, they just serve good ice cream without pretense. The thing is, they must be doing something right since they're popular with all age ranges and different groups of people. Plus, it seems like the high school kids working there are having a good time and actually glad to see you when you come in.

Great food, great prices and a great spot for lunch. Despite the fact that know nothing about Thai food, I love hitting up Thai Rama for lunch when I'm in the area. I've tried many of the lunch specials and every one has been delicious. People who know more about the food can comment on the specifics - all I know is its delicious!

$2.50 per item and if you drop-off before 9:00 am your stuff will be done by 4:00 pm.  Good basic dry cleaner that doesn't charge you an arm and a leg just to get your clothes cleaned and pressed.  Cash only - but if you forget they have an ATM in the lobby.  Recommended.

Since my last review the price has gone up to $2.75 per piece but it's still the best deal in town for dry cleaning and they still guarantee that if you get there by 9:00 it will be done by 4:00 that same day. It's also still cash only but they have an ATM.  Another benefit of this cleaners is that if you're headed South on 7th Avenue in the mornings you can turn in here from the suicide lane and then you can go East on Missouri from the parking lot which means you're effectively making a left turn that you otherwise can only make at Camelback or all the way down at Thomas.

First of all Phoenix is incredibly fortunate to have a theater chain like Harkins, Compared to other cities, the quality of the theaters, the selection of the movies, the ticket prices, and the deals on soda and popcorn Harkins is one of the best theater chain I have ever frequented and the sheer existence of this chain forces the other chains (AMC, UA) to keep prices reasonable and improve the quality of their own service, which doesn't happen in towns where there is no competition -- cough, cough... Sacramento.  If you're still picturing the Harkins Theatres at Christown as the way they were many years ago, when they were located right on 19th Avenue or even worse, if you remember the movie theater located upstairs in the old Christown Mall, you'll be surprised to find that this is a brand new theater complex, built about four years ago and just as nice as any other Harkins in the Valley. In fact, you don't even have to go through the mall to get to the theater.   With stadium seating, digital sound, large screens, rocker seats, all digital projection, a snack bar with all the options, ticket windows, and even self-serve ticket kiosks, Harkins Christown allows you to see movies the way they are supposed to be seen.  If you're in North Central Phoenix, this is a great place to see a film.

If you don't have an appointment be prepared to wait... and even if you do, you might be waiting for a while.   That being said, they are open on Saturday's and so if you're like me and your Doctor asks for blood draws once in a while, then this is a good option. Honestly, the wait isn't all that bad. You may stand for a while waiting to check in, but once you get there, you'll be processed quickly and asked to take a seat. Luckily the seats are comfortable, so just bring a book or play on your phone (although please bring headphones or earbuds if you're going to watch videos). Eventually they'll call your name and in my experience they have always been fast and professional once you are called.  Oh, and please have your forms and insurance card ready when you are called to the window. I've got to hand it to the staff, they deal with everyone very well, whether they speak English or not, whether they have insurance, or whether they even know why they're supposed to be there.

My six-year-old decided recently that he wants to play tennis and knowing that the Phoenix Tennis Center is near our house, I decided to bring him over to hit some balls. The workers at the front desk were very helpful and directed us to the back courts where Kat and Conrad Ramos were running the Grassroots Tennis program. This program is a great deal, where for only $10 a session your child can get a fun introduction to tennis that gets progressively more involved as the child gets better - plus the parents get to play as well. Since our first experience, we've been back three weeks in a row and my son would play everyday if he could.   There are plenty of courts and they are in decent shape but I did hear a rumor that they may be resurfaced this year and they might build a new clubhouse.  In addition to the kids program, I've noticed lots of league play at the facility and everyone seems very friendly. The pro shop is small, but would likely have what you need in a pinch.  As a tennis facility it probably only deserves three stars, but the kids program bumps it up to four.

Great little hardware store with excellent service!  Unlike the big orange box stores, I have never failed to receive a friendly greeting when walking into this store and you can't walk through the store without being offered assistance, generally multiple times.  They will make sure you find exactly the parts you need and they'll help you as much or as little you need to find those parts. Plus, like the old-fashioned hardware stores I loved as a kid, they still sell lots of fun stuff such as hobbyist gear and some home and garden decorations!  Don't let the fact that it's at 19th Avenue and Indian School scare you off, this is a great place to take care of all your home improvement needs!

This happened about two months ago, but I wasn't on Yelp at the time so I thought I'd share now.  I stopped in at the Petsmart at ChrisTown Mall to return an item I had previously purchased, but that our cats did not like (a freshwater drinking fountain).   However, because the item was over $50, the cashier had to call for a manager's approval. Despite the fact that there were supposedly 3 managers on duty, the cashier had to get on the PA 3-4 times and it took 10-12 minutes for one of the managers to come forward. During the time this took, the cashier was becoming extremely agitated - apologizing to me and complaining about the store managers and how lazy they were.  Eventually, when the manager walked by, the cashier had to flag her down and she acted as if she was surprised that she was needed. I was tempted to say "didn't you hear the multiple PA announcements asking for a manager to come to the front?" but I bit my tongue.  As the cashier was finally giving my refund, the other two managers came sauntering up the main aisle talking to each other and ignoring everything else.  Overall it was one of the worst examples of customer service I have ever seen and I will not return to this store.

Yes it's on Indian School and it's in the Avenues, but don't let that scare you because this is a great place to play and watch indoor soccer. My 8-year-old is playing in a league here and I've known other friends who've either played themselves or watched their kids play throughout the years. The facility is older, but the field is in good shape and they have everything you could want. Spectator seating is upstairs and its fun to watch the kids run around. Downstairs you have the team dugouts along with restrooms and a food and games area with windows facing the field, pinball games and an air hockey game. One nice thing is that if you're in the mood, the snack bar even serves beer and it's pretty cheap!  They also have a full service soccer store with great prices and a great selection of clothes, shoes, and gear.  So next time its over 100 degrees out and you and your kids start complaining about it being too hot to do anything, think about signing up for an indoor soccer league. They start every other month or so and playing in the air conditioning is a great way t stay in shape and get out of the heat!

I don't really know anything about soccer, but now that my 8-year-old is playing I am finding that there is a lot to learn about teams and equipment. Luckily, the people at Soccer Locker are great to work with and more than willing to share their knowledge! My son had outgrown his soccer cleats since last Fall, and luckily we hadn't replaced them yet, because in our first week of playing indoor soccer we found out that the kids can't wear cleats on the field, but rather flat or turf shoes. However, since he's also going to be participating in an outdoor camp this summer, we needed something that works for both. Gaby, at Soccer Locker, was very helpful in showing us the turf shoes that will work for both. She also helped him find the right size soccer ball that he wanted.  Additionally, with the World Cup starting up, they have a large supply of team shirts, balls, scarves, and every other accessory you could want for national teams, MLS teams, Premiere League, and other club teams.  Service is great, prices are reasonable and you even get a 10% discount if you're playing in a league at the Phoenix Sports Centre where the store is located. We will definitely be back!

This is a pretty small store, but its the closest one to my house and they have great service and everything you need.  Yes, it's a little cramped inside, but that's good because unlike the big home improvement stores, you're not wandering endlessly looking for someone to help. In fact, you are greeted right as you come in the door and you can't go down more than one aisle without being offered help.  When I just can't find the right size bolt, nut, or screw among the stuff I already have or I just need some other item quickly, this is my go-to store.   If you're in the area, check it out.

I don't know how this place stays in business because I hardly ever see anyone else in the store. However they do it though, it's a good thing because this is a nice store with a large selection of used books. If you want free internet or a coffee house, this is not the place to go. However, if you are looking to find some new reading material than feel free to check it out. Fair prices and a large selection of reading material make this one of the few reasons to go this far up 7th Avenue into Sunnyslope.

Lots of good stuff for crafting, sewing, science experiments, and other hobbies. One tip, never pay full price here. Just Google "Michaels Coupon" on your phone and you can always find deals for 30-50% off on your purchase... and if you can't they usually have a coupon available at the checkout. Plus, they're open on Sunday's... unlike Hobby Lobby.

Very friendly and helpful staff. When our house alarm started giving us error messages we figured out which sensor needed a new battery and I took it to the store.  They directed to the right one that I needed. Also I had heard that the batteries were expensive, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that they were only about $4. They carry all sorts of batteries along with light bulbs and the service is excellent!

I am sad to see how much this place has gone downhill. My wife and I have gone here for sandwiches, burgers and ice cream for the past 15 years and so when we wanted to grab a quick lunch after church today, we thought, lets stop in, get a bite and follow it with a quick sundae for us and the kids.  One good thing is that sometime since we were last there, they've opened up the floor plan and the room seems bigger. They've also added a few flat screen televisions on the walls so I was able to to keep an eye on the D-Backs game.  However, I noticed initially that the prices seemed higher and my wife realized that they had just put stickers on the menus to cover the old prices and list the new ones. In general, it appears all menu items have gone up around 40%, which is a pretty steep jump.  As for the food, the kids had a hamburger and chicken fingers, which is hard to screw up. My wife had an El Dorado which is turkey, cheddar and bacon in the parmesan crusted bread. One of my favorites has always been the grilled cheeses sandwich which is several types of cheese on the parmesan crusted bread. I noticed today that you could order this with bacon and I thought, lets give it a try, so that is what I ordered. Unfortunately, when it came the only cheese seemed to be a slice of Velveeta with some bacon that was not even close to crispy. It was basically an overpriced croque monsieur which was not even close to what I ordered.   Additionally, while service was not bad, it was just kind of lackadaisical. The servers wandered by every once in a while giving the perfunctory "how is everything" the first few times, and generally ignoring us after that.   By the time we finished eating and after realizing that the classic parfaits were now $7.50 rather than the old $4.95 I was no longer even interested in ice cream. The kids had a scoop each, which I tasted and wasn't all that impressed, and then we headed out, likely not to return anytime soon.

Fry's Electronics is basically a toy store for adults. Want computers, electronics, CDs, DVDs, appliances, stereos. TVs, etc? You can get it all here.  Whether you want a fully built system that is ready to be set up and used in your house or you like to build your own computer or home entertainment system, Fry's Electronics is the place for you.... and the prices constantly put other stores to shame.  If you're looking for electronics, look to Fry's.

What a pleasant surprise... a place in a not-so-great area of Mesa that looks like a hole-in-the-wall liquor store at first glance with a great selection of alcohol and a really cool little wine cellar and craft beer bar in the basement.  I came here for a special event recently... as part of the Arizona rollout of craft beers from Ninkasi Brewing Company and when I pulled up I wasn't sure what to expect.  However, when I walked in, they directed me downstairs and when I went down I found an amazing little underground bar and lounge. The bar is small, with seats for about 6 people, but the room is huge and full of different wines and beers. However, when you walk back further, you find two other rooms with comfortable chairs and couches. Somebody said that it looked like a place where you would find belly dancers and I had to agree, what with the red couches and drapes hanging from the ceilings.  Having worked in Mesa for several years some time ago, I think its fair to say that there aren't a lot of places with "character" to get a drink in that city, so I was happy to find that Sun Devil Liquors is there to fill the void. I'm just bummed that I didn't know about it when I was still working in that part of the Valley.

Scottsdale Stadium is a great place to catch a spring training game! Even though its one of the older stadiums in the Cactus League, the City of Scottsdale, the Charros, and the Giants have done a great job of keeping it updated and providing an excellent gameday experience. Get there early if you want to park within a few blocks, otherwise be prepared to walk or catch one of the many pedicabs or golf carts offering rides to the stadium. Once you get in you'll realize that there is not a bad seat in the house, whether your right next to the field, up in the stands, or on the grass berm above the outfield. Food choices include ballpark favorites like hot dogs, chicken tenders, barbeques, and for the SF visitors, garlic fries. There are plenty of places to buy adult beverages and souvenirs.  So what are you waiting for? Get out and enjoy a spring training game (or a fall league game) at Scottsdale Stadium today!

Good, cheap, and fast!. This is a place to go when you're craving Mexican food but don't want to spend Scottsdale type of money. My understanding is that its owned by one of the members of the Garcia's family, but unlike the restaurants which were sold by the family to a franchise chain, this place is still a local operation, much like Garcia's de las Avenidas at 35th Avenue and Encanto. It's basic, traditional, Mexican food that is homemade and tastes great.

The last time I was here was about a decade ago to see Baryshnikov perform with a friend of mine which was cool because we got to go backstage after the show. And while the performance was amazing, the space left something to be desired.  That's why I was so impressed when I returned recently and saw how they have renovated the space. The formerly sterile walls have been covered with natural wood acoustic panels and the formerly boring seats have been replaced as well. The atmosphere is now inviting and warm and the acoustics have been improved greatly.   It's great to see that the Valley has another quality location to see a show or a concert and with all the choices in the area for dining and drinks, the Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts is a prime location for a great evening out.

My aunt gave me her old guitar more than 30 years ago and I've finally decided that I should learn to play it. However, one of the first things I found out that I needed to do was get it set up properly. Luckily I stumbled upon Bronson Guitar Works. They took my old acoustic guitar, cleaned it up, fixed the action, replaced the strings, and made it feel like something brand new. Mark Bronson also appreciated the fact that I know nothing about guitars and took the time to explain everything he had done.  However, don't take my word for it. Consider the fact that when he's not touring with Bruce Springsteen you might see Nils Lofgren here. You also might find George Benson taking some licks on a guitar or just shooting the breeze. Other artists who trust Bronson Guitar Works include B.B. King, Bruce Springsteen, and Robin Wilson of the Gin Blossoms. Clearly these guys know their stuff and they love working on great instruments.  But they also put just as much work into the guitars of those of us who aren't rock stars, even those of us who are just beginning. And that's because most importantly, they love music and this is a great place for anyone who loves music.  Highly, highly recommended!

Had some friends visiting from NYC this past weekend and they were staying at the Phoenician, so we headed over to catch up and let our kids play together. Unfortunately, I, and they, were extremely disappointed by the poor service at the resort.   Firstly, the computers were down when they got in, so they wound up sitting in the lobby for nearly 4-hours waiting to be given a room.  Then after we got there, my friend's daughter got stung by a bee at the wading pool and there was absolutely no response from the staff. There were at least 4 hotel employees standing by the nearby cabana and not a single one came over to ask why this 4 1/2 year-old child was suddenly screaming hysterically and why her mother was rushing around. Her husband had to go ask for ice to soothe the sting and it was probably 10-minutes later that one of the employees came by and casually handed us a bunch of bee-sting compresses from the first aid kit. I mean, how hard is it to walk by and ask if everything is OK when a child who has been playing just fine suddenly starts screaming like a banshee?  Also, every time my friends wanted to order food or drink at the pool it took forever to get the attention of a waiter and often the response was not that they would take the order, but rather that they would find the correct server - who several times didn't even show and once again we had to go into the flagging-down a server ritual.  All in all, the service experience was extremely poor. My friends had just recently stayed at the Ritz Carlton Palm Beach and, in comparison, were quite disappointed with the Phoenician.   As a Phoenix resident, I was personally embarrassed by the service. Luckily, they enjoyed the town, but next time they'll probably stay at the Ritz or the Four Seasons.

How is it that I've never been here before? This place has been around for quite a while but it wasn't until our annual office Thanksgiving lunch this year that I finally checked it out. Well, the good thing, is, I loved it and I'm definitely going back to try some other menu items.   It wasn't very crowded at lunch so we had the chance to look around and the place is really well done. I love the funky decorations and would even be comfortable coming back and eating at the round bar by myself.   After looking at other Yelp reviews I had to try the Exotic Mushroom Pan Fry. Growing up eating morels as a regular dish at my grandparents' house in Michigan I still have trouble thinking of them as an "exotic" mushroom, but considering the price they sell for in the stores, I guess they are. The other types of mushrooms included portobello, shiitake, cremini, button, and others. You could definitely taste all the different types and they went extremely well with the polenta cakes.   Others in my party tried the pastrami, ham & cheese miraviglioso, chicken and waffle sandwich, and the west coast wrap. While I didn't try any samples, everyone was raving about their food.  I'm definitely going back to try the Burger 2.0 which is described as ground buffalo stuffed with duck confit and the Berkshire Pork Belly from the appetizers menu.  Cowboy Ciao definitely gets my vote as a great place to go.

If you like to read and enjoy supporting local businesses then this is a place you need to check out. Poisoned Pen has been around for quite a while. It specializes in mystery novels, but also carries an excellent selection of local authors as well. It's not just a bookstore, it also has its own publishing imprint, and hosts numerous author discussions every month, including local authors and even bestsellers. Just get on the e-mail list and you'll be kept up to date on who's coming to town and when. Plus, even if you miss your favorite author they almost always have an autographed copy of the book you are seeking. And, I don't know if this is true or not, but I heard a rumor that the Poisoned Pen is one of the bookstores nationwide where sales help determine the New York Times Bestseller Lists, so you're not only buying good books, you're actually influencing the worldwide sales of those books.

This is a great place to get an eye exam. As I only started wearing prescription glasses a few years ago, they were very understanding and answered all of my numerous questions.  The only complaint that I have is with the price of their glasses and lenses. Just to have new lenses put in a frame that I already own would cost me over $400.   While I'm confident that they determined the best possible prescription for my eyes, I'll be looking to get my glasses somewhere a little cheaper.

This is my favorite store!   It's a traditional department store where you can get everything from clothing and shoes to kitchen appliances, bedding, jewelry, and home decorations. Basically, if you need it, Dillard's has it.... and likely at a much better price than you expected.  Plus, not only do they carry name brands they also carry a large selection of private and exclusive labels that are well designed and inexpensive.  Dillard's... it's my go to store!

I decided to try this place because it is near my office and I had some pants that needed the cuffs and zipper fixed and another pair that needed the waist let out.  The owners were very nice and the work was done extremely well, but unfortunately I can't recommend using this place based on the wait and the price.   My simple repairs took two weeks to complete and lets just say, cost substantially more than other places I have used.  Sorry, but sewing and alterations are not enough of a unique skill that I am willing to wait so long and overpay.  I'll be returning to Phoenix Custom Tailors at 32nd and Thomas in the future.

I don't shop here often but it's cool to know that when you see something in a magazine or online and it's only available at Neiman Marcus that we have one and you can stop in and check it out in person.  Great selection of top-end designer brands that you can't find anywhere else. I recently stopped to check out some Tom Ford stuff and was suitably impressed.   Oh, and don't be intimidated by the sales staff. They live and work here just like the rest of us.

If you can call a place that's been around for over 20 years a hidden gem, then I guess that's a good description of Karsen's. If I hadn't met dayside bartender Heidi at another location I would never have known of this place and I've probably walked by it numerous times in the past.  Located on 1st Street in Old Town Scottsdale, Karsen's is a great place for comfort food like burgers, salads, soups, and patty melts. Karsen's also sports a full bar.  In addition to the food, the other item that's clearly kept Karsen's going all these years is the atmosphere. The staff and the owners clearly know and value their regulars and you can tell that the regulars reciprocate. Even going in as a new customer I was made to feel very welcome and that's the type of service that builds loyalty.  If you want a no-pressure, low key place to get food or drinks in Old Town Scottsdale, check out Karsen's Grill, you won't be disappointed.

I remember when this first opened, back in the late 90's or early 2000's, it was a big deal because it was the first location of this restaurant outside of New York. Now, I look at the menu and Grimaldi's appears to be in 14 or 15 states. Unfortunately, it seems like the quality has gone downhill as the chain expanded. Maybe it's just because there are now so many other good pizza options in the Valley but on my most recent visit I was not impressed. The pizza was average at best and definitely overpriced. Plus I feel like the menu used to have more options. I really can't recommend this place anymore when there are so many better places to go.

When my wife asked me what I wanted for Christmas I told her a DSLR camera, but when she came back from Costco and told me that the cheapest package was $500 I thought maybe I really didn't need a new camera. But then it occurred to me, I don't buy new cars because the depreciation just isn't worth it, so why should I buy a new camera. In fact why not check the pawn shops to see if they had something that I would like. My first stop was SuperPawn on Scottsdale Road. It's basically right across the street from SkySong and while its not the biggest shop they have, it seems to have a good selection. In fact they had four cameras that I found interesting... a Nikon D40X for $250, two Canon Rebels and a Nikon D3200 for $200. I wrote down the information and went to do some quick internet research. I pretty quickly determined that the D3200 was the camera I wanted as it had great reviews and lots of Nikon parts and lenses are available to add as I get to be a better photographer. I went back to the store and told Garrett that I was interested in that camera. I would have bought it right then, but he said that it had come in with a battery charger and some cables as well, but he needed to find them. I gave him my phone number and told him to call me when they had all the stuff. A day or so later he called me back. Unfortunately in the hustle and bustle of the holiday season they couldn't figure out what they had done with the other stuff, but he had researched it and I could get a battery charger at Amazon for $25 and because I had waited he knocked another $50 off the price. A DSLR camera for $150? Heck yeah! I jumped in my car and headed right over. They also give you a guarantee. If you make a return in one week you get your cash back and if you do it in the first 30 days you get store credit.  After getting the camera, I headed to Fry's Electronics where I got a battery charger for $15, a memory card, and a card reader that don't come with the camera anyway. In fact, Fry's had the exact same camera for $350 with the lens I have, and the same $500 package as Costco that includes a bag and a second lens (buy still not the memory card or memory card reader).  I then went out and took as many pictures as I could in the first week just in case there was a problem and I needed to return it, but it turned out the camera works great at shooting pictures and videos.  So in sum, I got a new camera and accessories for at least $200 than just the camera alone and now I can have that extra money to buy additional lenses, filters, flashes, etc. as I want them.  I also found out that pawn shops are a great place to buy something like this and they even had a good selection of power tools, televisions, game systems, stereos, jewelry, bikes, and musical instruments. If you're in the area check out SuperPawn and ask for Garrett.

It's coming up on the New Year when many people make that yearly resolution to get in shape, drop a few pounds, or just live a healthier lifestyle. If this is you, you've also probably wondered what type of supplements you can use to help achieve your goals, but where do you get information about these supplements? From websites or magazines that are really just paid ads for the supplement companies?  Luckily, the Valley of the Sun is home to House of Fitness where you can get real knowledge from people who are as committed to a healthy lifestyle as you are! And unlike another Valley chain (cough, cough, Hi Health) the people here won't constantly try and steer you to store brands on which they make a higher profit margin. Instead, House of Fitness gives you solid information with friendly, quality service.   And, unlike some stores that charge you an arm and a leg for supplements, House of Fitness has reasonable prices that are cheaper than most other brick and mortar locations and even match the costs you'll find online. Why go to some out-of-state website when you can talk to a real person and support a local business?  And hey, don't let the logo or name scare you, you don't have to be a hard-core bodybuilder to shop here, just someone who wants to get into shape. Of course if you are a serious competitor, this is definitely the place for you.  As residents of the Phoenix area, we are lucky to have these stores in our region!

When I decided to start riding my bike to work a few days a week, the first thing I needed to do was to convert my 13-year-old mountain bike to a commuter bike and ensure that everything was working as designed. I checked with several different bike shops and they all quoted me between $85-$150 just for a tune-up and that didn't even include replacing my knobby mountain bike tires with smoother ones that would give less road resistance and replacing my bike seat that had cracked after years of sitting in the Arizona sun.  Luckily, before I committed to anything, I found Bike Shop. When I called I found that I could have everything on my bike done for less than the price of just a tune-up at some of the other shops.   I stopped in with my bike and Dale, who runs the place, told me that he could have my bike done in about a week. Five days later, my bike looked and rode like new and my wallet wasn't hurt as badly as could have been!  If you want to buy a new bike or just keep your old one in great shape, I highly recommend Bob's Bike Shop!

Don't plan to eat here because they have very little seating, but if you want a Blizzard, a Dilly Bar, a soft serve cone, or an Orange Julius to ward off the triple digit heat of a Scottsdale summer, this is a good place to go.  If you want a gelato pr a frozen yogurt, you're in the wrong place.

I'd always had perfect vision so when I had to start wearing prescription reading glasses a few years ago I was shocked by the prices you have to pay for frames and lenses.   That's why I was glad to remember that Lesco has a location in Scottsdale. They also have four locations in Tucson so I was familiar with the company, but I'd never actually shopped there.   The first thing you notice is the large selection of frames and the second is the fact that basic glasses are yours for $29, $49 for bifocals, and $179 for progressives. You couldn't even get one lens for that at the expensive optical stores. Add in the anti-glare coating and I paid about $70 for a new pair of reading glasses.  You'd assume that for that price it would be a lot of do it yourself work, but the service here is great! The staff knows what they are doing, will help you pick out your frames, and even adjust them for you so that they fit perfectly.  Also, you get your glasses quickly. Mine were done barely a week after I ordered them and now I'm considering getting a few additional styles to change up my look... hey for the prices they charge, why not?

After more experience with Lesco I am upgrading them from four to five stars. I recently went for my yearly eye exam and found that I actually need a bit of distance correction along with my reading glasses which led me to decide that I needed a pair of progressive glasses. I also wanted to get a pair of prescription sunglasses so I can do things like drive, read, and look at Yelp on my phone while outside. However, I didn't want to buy another pair of frames because I already had a pair that I liked. Unfortunately, most optometrists won't put a new pair of lenses in frames that you already own, but Lesco will. I took in the reading glasses that I had bought a few years back (and paid a pretty penny for) and I picked up a pair of Randolph Engineering Aviator frames on Ebay and for less than the cost of one new pair of glasses at my eye doctor I now have two great pairs of glasses.  And it doesn't stop there, I've gone in several times to have the frames adjusted and tightened until they fit perfectly. Service is always friendly, quick, and extremely well done.   I don't think I will ever go anywhere else for my glasses!

Upon moving back to Arizona from California one of the things I had to accomplish was to get my car re-registered, but who wants to spend hours sitting at the DMV? So when one of my co-workers suggested Action Auto Title, my ears perked up.  Yes, you still have to go get emissions testing at one of the state locations, but once that was done I headed down Scottsdale Road to Action Auto Title and within 10 minutes I walked out with a new license plate and registration for my car. The charge, just an additional $20 beyond the regular state fees. The savings, several hours of my life waiting for my number to be called at the DMV.  If you need to get your car registered in Arizona, Action Auto Title is the way to go.  Now if Arizona would just allow private locations to perform the emissions testing the way they do in California...

Someday, when I have a big enough office or the freedom to set my own rules, I am going to put in one of this dorm-size fridges and stock it with a bunch of cool sodas that you can't find anywhere except this store. Until then, I have to be satisfied with stopping in once in a while when I find myself in the area and filling up a random 6-pack of drinks. Just the chance to find sasparilla, orange creme sodas, Dublin Dr. Pepper (when it's in stock), ginger ales and root beers makes my mouth water. I still have a preference for drinking an ice cold soda out of a glass bottle and this is one of the few places to still find them.

Quality, fast, affordable service!  I buy all my tires from Discount Tire because the warranty they provide is the best in the business and the service is impeccable.  The other day one of my co-workers noticed that one of my front tires was low and so I ran down to Discount Tire. They looked at it and noted that I must have hit something in the road, because my tire was gashed and needed to be replaced. At other places, I would probably expect to pay $100-200 for a new tire, but because I always get the Discount Tire warranty (for about $15 per tire), I was able to have a new tire put on my car for just an additional $20.   And, I was in and out in less than 30-minutes and able to get back on with my day.  Discount Tire - I won't go anywhere else!

Arizona's western heritage means that quite a few of us have a pair, or two, of cowboy boots in our closet and many tourists will choose to pick up a pair while visiting the state. Naturally, that means that there are many stores that will overcharge customers for a pair of cowboy boots. Luckily Cowtown Boots is not one of those stores. Cowtown carries an excellent selection of boots and western apparel at reasonable prices. It's also the best place in town to get boots for your kids without having to take a loan from their college fund.   This Cowtown Boots is not the biggest store in town, and if you want an even bigger selection than drive over to the their store at I-17 and Thunderbird, but if you're in the Tempe/Scottsdale area, this store has practically everything you need.  So if you're in the mood to Cowboy Up, don't be a city slicker, instead go where the cowboys go and get yourself a pair of new kicks!

I hadn't been here in about 10 years until this week when I came for a luncheon / professional training and clearly while I've been gone they've greatly improved this place. For those who don't know, this is a private club for SRP employees that is kind of like a country club, but without a golf course. The main clubhouse has a number of meeting rooms and ballrooms. Our meeting was held in the new pavilion which is a large room that could host a very large party. There's also a workout facility that appears to have been redone since I was last here and very large pool which has also been renovated in the last decade. Like most clubs, the facilities are also available for rent to community groups, parties, wedding, etc and this would be a great place to do that. But what I really love is that SRP still makes this available to its employees and hosts a tremendous annual picnic/bbq for them as well. It reminds me of something that companies used to do in the Mad Men days and hopefully is something that companies might start doing again someday. For now though, enjoy the PERA Club if you get a chance.

I've come here before and didn't have any issues, but this time I really saw the lack of service that they provide.   When I dropped my mower off, they were so busy arguing with another customer about whether they had misplaced his trimmer that they barely took the time to acknowledge me. In fact, I had to ask if they wanted to know what was wrong with my machine because they were just going to take my info and let me leave.   Because of that, although they got it running and sharpened the blade, they didn't replace one of the broken knobs on the handle as I had asked them to do while they had it.  Also its unclear whether or not the $20 deposit they require is actually applied to your bill. I saw no indication of it on the bill they gave me when I picked up my mower, but considering I had just watched them berate the woman in front of me who asked if they had raised their rates, I decided against asking.  Despite having been here before, I will be looking for a new place the next time my mower needs work and I'd recommend others do the same.

My favorite restaurant in Phoenix. The old ratpack style atmosphere and gathering of local business leaders along with politicos just adds to the fun. Unlike most of the new steakhouses along the Camelback/Biltmore corridor, Durant's is not pretentious. In fact, I've even walked in after golfing while still wearing shorts and a windshirt and received great service. While not inexpensive, you also won't pay an arm and a leg for a steak at Durant's like some of the newer places. Don't want dinner or by yourself, hang out at the bar and have a martini - they know how to make 'em!

I've been to about half a dozen Major League stadiums in my life and Chase Field is far and away my favorite. Naturally I'm biased since I'm a true Arizonan and have been a fan of the Diamondbacks ever since the announcement that we were getting a team in the state.   I've been to Chase Field for numerous baseball games, political rallies, religious events and concerts and I've sat everywhere from the very top row to right behind the dugout and I must say there is not a bad seat in the house. I've been to the playgrounds behind center field and on the upper level and I've been cut off at the bar under the seats behind home plate (not my proudest moment) so overall I have a pretty good feel for this park.  Sure concessions can be pricey and the face value on really good tickets can be expensive but if you know what you are doing, the whole trip can be a good value. Buy your water and peanuts from the vendors on the street and take them inside with you , but remember not to open them before you enter.  For tickets, scalping is legal if they are across the street from the plaza, so check the scalpers and feel free to shop around. When the D-Backs aren't playing well (like this year) you should be able to get a pair of tickets for less than the face value of one. Heck, even in 2001 when they won the World Series you could almost always get tickets at face value or even a slight discount.  The ballpark has a wide variety of concessions and even offers a value menu of food items for just $1.50.  When its 110-degrees outside and you want a few hours out of the heat there's no better alternative than visiting Chase Field and remember to root root root for the D-Backs, because if they don't win it's a shame.

OK - so it can be crowded, disorganized and hectic, plus a lot of guys may think this is only a place for women. However, with $350 Allen Edmonds dress shoes for $49.99, $80 dress shirts for $9.99 and $100 pants for around $20, it's well worth making a stop at Last Chance. It's one of the best ways for professional men to dress well on a budget.

Fun selection of used CDs, DVDs, video games, books, posters, and other pop culture paraphernalia. Prices are reasonable and you can even trade in the entertainment materials you no longer want. (I tend to take my trade to Bookman's first and then to Zia, but I usually have more books to trade then anything else).   Because of the low prices you can pick up that CD that only has two songs you like or that movie you wouldn't necessarily pay full price for but you'd like to see more than once. Plus you might find a t-shirt for that band you like or a stocking stuffer for your sweetheart.   Zia's, it's probably the closest thing to an old school record store you'll find in Phoenix.

This is the archetypical Scottsdale restaurant / nightspot. In fact, if you have friends from out of town and want to give them a real sense of Scottsdale nightlife, this is place to go.  Great food, great drinks, and great people watching. Sure it can get extremely crowded, its somewhat overpriced, and many of the people look like the could be on a Bravo or E reality show, but hey, that's Scottsdale.  So get a spray tan, some Botox for your forehead, Restylane for your lips, put on your designer jeans, ladies wear your Louboutins, guys wear that watch that's bigger than my car, and head out with the beautiful people to AZ 88.   It's been going strong for over 20 years, so they must be doing something right.

As someone who was a child in the 80's, I grew up in shopping malls and it doesn't get better than Scottsdale Fashion Square. I actually remember when this was an open air mall, but having a roof, and expansions that have increased the size to at least four times as big it used to be has only made this mall better and more fun to shop.   Sure, you may see more silicone enhanced women than in a strip club and the Scottsdale bros with their frosted tips and designer jeans can be amusing, but the people watching just adds to the fun of shopping here.  Whether your window shopping or actually purchasing, Scottsdale Fashion Square is a great place to look... and in the Arizona summer a great way to get out of the heat!

I've been hearing about this place for several years and finally stopped in this past Sunday with my family for lunch. Even on a Sunday the restaurant was full but we got lucky and there was no wait for a table. Service was excellent with our waiter giving good suggestions and advice about what to order. We got a few baskets of the mixed fries - regular and sweet potatoes - which come in the miniature shopping carts as mentioned by other reviewers. The fries are delicious and my children loved the little carts.   For the main meal, my wife and I both had the Delux Burger as did my mother-in-law and my father-in-law had a salad. The burgers are big so bring your appetite or prepare to share your food! However, the burgers are delicious and well worth the reputation they have earned.  I didn't try any, but the selection of microbrews is extremely impressive and its nice to see a place with such a good representation of local and regional beers.  Finally, save room for dessert. The choices looked great and I saw other diners enjoying them. Unfortunately I was already stuffed!  Overall, Delux is definitely pricey but well worth it for one of the best burgers I have ever experienced. If I lived in Phoenix full time, I would make this a regular stop!

Great place to run or bike without having to worry about traffic. The Arizona Canal can take you all the way from Peoria to Scottsdale depending on how far you want to go. While you do have to cross some streets, there are tunnels under the freeways and some of the bigger streets like 24th Street. If you're looking for a place to get in your long run or bike ride or you just want to get across town, try the canal. Remember though, if you're out at night there are no streetlights so take a light.

I'm probably biased because I practically grew up in the original Bookman's in Tucson and by that I mean I started with them in their initial location that no longer exists and was there the day that they moved into the former El Rancho Market. One of my main regrets in moving to Phoenix in '99 was that the only Bookman's was all the way in Mesa and my apartment was at 19th and Northern. Luckily, I eventually spent nearly three years working across the 60 from the Mesa Bookman's and they finally opened a Phoenix store right around the corner from my old apartment. Since we still live in North Central Phoenix, I find myself spending a fair amount of time at Bookman's. I've even introduced my children to the store and hope they will grow up with as many good memories of this store as I have.  Bookman's is a great place to just wander and find books you never would have considered. It's also the best place to buy DVD's and why would anyone pay full price for magazines when Bookman's usually has the new issue within 2-3 weeks of publication?

Phoenix is lucky to have a theater like this, and by that I mean one that brings in the documentaries, foreign films, and award nominees that don't get play in the regular multiplexes.  Sure, other towns sometimes have one art theater that will play a limited selection of these movies, but to have a multi-screen theater that runs these films continuously throughout the year is just a treat and Harkin's Theatres should be commended for making this available.  Yes, it's a little dated inside, and I do wish they had stadium seating, but those are minor complaints. In fact, I'm old enough to remember going to see Tron when it was first released in 1982 at the Camelview (before the mall even had another theater) and I loved the theater then and I still love it today.  I certainly hope the rumors that this theater will be demolished to make room for more mall expansion are just rumors because the Camelview Theater is a shining point of light for cinephiles in the Valley and it deserves to remain so.

Who'd have thought that my first excuse to try this place would be because they happen to have the PAC-12 Network on TV.  To explain, I planned to watch the ASU - Arizona Football Game on TV at my house and about an hour before the game started realized that it was being aired on a station my DirecTV doesn't get.   I initially headed over to Zipps at 16th and Bethany Home to catch the game, but quickly realized that everyone in the area had the same idea. So I decided to walk around and see where else I could watch the game. After checking several places I ended up walking by the door to Dick's and noticing that the game was on its TVs.  I had run into a couple of other guys while walking and so I grabbed them and we headed in. However, because the bar was already full, the host said that he could put us in the back room that also had a TV.  The three of us ended up getting our own table next to the fireplace and located within easy site of a big, flat screen, TV in the back room where we got personalized service from the waiter. The service was great and the food and drinks were excellent. What a better experience than being crammed like a sardine into a sports bar! In fact, this may be my new place to watch games when I'm not at the stadium.  Dick's Hideaway, I hope you don't mind if I call you Brad's Hideaway!

I've never been a huge fan of Chinese food and I'm still not one who would really consider Chinese food or take-out, but despite this, Pei Wei has won me over.   Our typical order is kung pao chicken, mongolian beef, fried rice and pot stickers - all with brown rice. It's always good and always fast. In fact, I've even called right as they were closing and they have been willing to let me in 15-20 minutes after close to pick up my meal.  I will say, we usually get our food to go and just take it home. The few times I've eaten in this location, or others, it just seems too loud and crowded.  My only complaint with Pei Wei is that about 1 out of 5 times, the fortune cookies don't have a fortune - clearly a quality issue with their supplier.  Other than that I really like Pei Wei as a healthier, quick alternative for take-out food.

My home internet was recently down so in order to get online I packed up my laptop and headed to this coffee shop just down the street from my house. Not being a coffee drinker I can only say that the hot chocolate was very good. As others have mentioned, the work space is great. Fast internet connection, large table in the center with power strips and individual tables with great power hookups all around the room. I think I even recognized some fellow Yelpers.

I can't believe that I haven't reviewed this store yet... I love this place!  I don't hunt or fish, but we do camp and hike and I'm going to be doing more backpacking now that my oldest son is in Boy Scouts. Plus, we have a dog and Cabela's has a great selection of canine supplies.  I was actually a fan of Cabela's before they opened this store in Glendale having read their catalogs for years, but this store is amazing. Maybe its not as big as the Bass Pro Shop in Mesa, but its definitely big enough. Plus, the selection is excellent, prices are great, and I've always received excellent service.  Today I picked up a new sleeping bag for way cheaper than I expected and in the past I've bought everything from shirts and socks to a popcorn maker. You can get clothing, camping equipment, hunting gear, guns, bows, boats, electronics, etc. And not only do they carry all of the name brands, but the Cabela's branded items are excellent quality as well.  Plus they have fun stuff for the kids including a giant fish tank, a mountain with stuffed game animals, a trophy room, and a shooting gallery like you remember at the old fashioned coin galleries. They even have a conference room where groups can hold meetings.  And of course, this is Yelp so lets talk about the food. The cafe upstairs serves sandwiches made from all sorts of exotic meats including venison, elk, ostrich, and buffalo. The price is good and the food is great.  It's a medical fact that being outside increases health and decreases stress, so if you're ready to get outside get to Cabela's and get the stuff you need!

After our 6-year-old cat had to be rushed to the vet with a urinary blockage earlier this year, we went online and did some research about the best type of cat foods. Wag N' Wash is one of the few places that carries organic, natural foods for dogs and cats. Our two cats eat nothing but Wellness Brand organic food now and they have never been happier and their fur has never felt so soft.  We recently got a labrador/shepherd puppy for our children and our first stop on the way home from the pound was at Wag N' Wash to get dogfood and treats.  With two cats and a dog, we're buying food every few weeks. The people at Wag N' Wash are among the nicest I've ever met and always happy to answer a question or take the time to make sure you have everything you need.

What the heck happened to this mall? Yes, I realize we've come a long ways from the glory days of the early 80's when this was the biggest mall in Arizona and I believe, the biggest mall in the entire Southwest. In fact, this mall was so big that teens would come from miles around to shop, ice skate at the indoor rink in the mall, and cruise the circle drive around the parking lot.  Even in the early 2000's, when I worked at a bank in Glendale fairly close to the mall, it was headed downhill, but still a place I would go on a quick shopping trip.  Today we stopped to look for some items at the Dillard's Outlet and then walked into the mall for a little bit. What a ghost town! The mall has only three places left to recommend it to visitors, the previously mentioned Dillard's Outlet, Sports Chalet and the Harkin's Theatre.  Overall, a disappointing and depressing experience.

While much of Phoenix definitely fits the stereotype of overgrown suburbs and masses of humanity, its nice to remember that we have several wilderness areas where you can get outside and experience nature, and they're conveniently located right in the center of town. Places like Camelback Mountain, South Mountain, North Mountain Park, and Piestewa Peak are probably the best known, but Dreamy Draw certainly holds its own.  Located right off of the 51 and Northern, Dreamy Draw is a hidden gem right in the center of town. With plentiful parking, and both paved and unpaved trails for every skill level, Dream Draw is a great place to go for a walk, a run, a hike, a mountain bike ride, or even just have a picnic. The different levels of trails means that you'll enjoy it whether your skill level consists of keeping up with your kids or your avid hiker / trail runner brother-in-law. And you can even bring your dog or ride your horse (if you have one).  So if you want a break from the everyday hustle and bustle of the city streets, take a break and head over to Dreamy Draw. You went believe how real this dream seems.

You might not realize it, but U.S. Egg is kind of a mecca for people trying to live a healthy lifestyle and eat a high-protein diet. Yes, they have all the standard breakfast and brunch foods, but if you look at the back of the menu there is a section titled "Proteins" where they list protein pancakes, steak and eggs with a sliced tomato instead of hash browns, eggs with a hamburger patty, omelettes with bacon, salads with lettuce, meats, and cottage cheese, etc. There's even a gluten-free option and it all tastes really good!  Plus, every time I've eaten here, or at the location at Baseline and Mill, service has been great... prompt and with a smile. So if you're looking for a place to grab a quick breakfast or lunch, show your patriotism and head for U.S. Egg!

Love this library! Did you know that you don't even have to be a Scottsdale resident, just a Maricopa County resident to get a library card here? They have an excellent selection of books, magazines, movies, and DVD's. There's a large children's and young adult section as well and numerous computers for those who want to get online. Plus, you can have books or other items delivered here from any of the Scottsdale libraries and they will e-mail you when your items arrive.  There's even a new coffee shop in the lobby and all of the employees are extremely friendly.  Definitely high on my list of recommendations.

I have a tendency to forget about this restaurant, but after having dinner there the other night, I don't know why. We went to celebrate my father-in-law and brother-in-law's birthday. Because it wasn't a game night and because we had an early reservation, 6:00 p.m., the restaurant was practically deserted (apparently First Friday is not a big draw here).  The service and food was excellent. We started the table with the calamari and the classic appetizer sampler consisting of roasted garlic prawns, terriyaki tenderloin and hot King crab and artichoke dip. Each of these were delicious.  With my meal, I had a cup of New England Clam Chowder which was extremely good although a bit thin. My brother-in-law had the French Onion soup and the taste I had was excellent.  For dinner, I had the Prime Rib which definitely lived up to the waitresses' description as a house specialty. My wife had the Filet Mignon and said it was excellent.  In the past, I have also had the Seafood Linguine and the Smoked and Grilled Pork Chop along with other entrees.  In fact, I have never had anything from this restaurant I didn't like.  Because the restaurant was so empty, I took the opportunity to walk around and look at the decorations more closely this time. Despite being a relative newcomer to the state, they've done a great job of paying homage to Arizona with historic pictures of the places such as the Camelback Inn, Downtown Phoenix, Grand Canyon lodges and even the historic Arizona Inn in Tucson.  Also, although pricey, Kincaid's is not as ridiculously expensive as some of the other new steakhouses here in the valley and considering that the meals come with sides, it's actually quite less expensive.  I highly recommend this restaurant.

The original Phoenix sports franchise is still a great time.   Yes, they're a young team this year and don't have many big names, but going to a game at US Airways Center is always a good time. And speaking of the arena, the Suns and the City have done a great job of keeping it updated.  NBA basketball is still one of the most exciting sports to watch and watching it in person is always great, so get out and go see a game. You'll enjoy it!

When I think of historic Scottsdale I think of the Hotel Valley Ho. This is a classic that has been updated to fit into the modern world. For those not from here, this hotel reminds me of the The Standard in Downtown LA.. Whether you come here for a stay during Spring Training, for drinks in the lobby bar or on the roof, or even for poolside yoga, this is a great place to visit. Great service and a cool vibe in a classic art-deco style building. Plus, its close enough to the bar district that if necessary, you could stumble back.  All in all, the Valley Ho is a gem in the City of Scottsdale.

Saw the other reviews so I decided to give it a try.  The first thing I noticed on entering was the sign over the jukebox saying they had perfect health inspection scores 11-times in a row and the owner told me it was now up to 12. Anyplace that keeps their kitchen and restaurant that clean is good in my book.  Ordered a large basket with 3 chicken fingers, fries and Texas Toast. Probably because I had my 2 1/2 year old son with me, the owner added an extra few fingers to the order - very nice of him.  The food was very tasty. Crispy skin and juicy chicken. I usually don't like thick french fries but these were very well done.  The owner also mentioned to me that the food was cooked in Canola oil and had no trans-fats and no cholesterol. Definitely made me feel better about eating deep-fried foods.  All in all, I really liked the place and will definitely return.

I detest clipping my own toenails and when I've tried I end up cutting myself, bleeding, and making them even worse than when I started.  So when they start getting too long or ragged I head over to this place on my lunch hour for a quick pedicure.  Yes, they do have a number of different levels of pedicure that they will ask if you want and I guess if you're not paying attention you could wind up with the $40 option. However, the basic pedicure is $25 which is what I usually get. I assume they have all sorts of options for polishes and colors, but I've never gotten any of those. Rather just clipping and shaping followed by a nice foot massage and I'm good to go.  As for the service, it's quick and well done. They have the standard massaging chairs and the typical selection of trash-culture celebrity magazines like People and US Weekly. Even though there's usually only two people working I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes before I'm in the chair.   If you're looking for a good place to get a pedicure and a little pampering for your feet, check out Nature Nails Center.

Nice big music store with everything you could ask for in the way of instruments, music, accessories, etc. Service was very friendly and knowledgeable and they let my 11-year-old hold and try several instruments as he made up his mind about what he wants to play. The only drawback is that they don't rent month-to-month and once he decided he's going to try playing trumpet we didn't need a full year agreement as I have two trumpets at my parent's house in Tucson and just need to get them up to Phoenix and cleaned up. However, in terms of service, pricing, and the overall quality of the experience, I give this place 5 stars. If you're a musician, check it out!

I'm really surprised by all the negative reviews of this store.   This is my neighborhood grocery store and I have been shopping here for nearly 12 years. It was originally a Fred Meyer and then converted to a Fry's Marketplace.   This is a very nice grocery store with an excellent selection of food and other merchandise. From some of the reviews, you would think this is some ghetto market. However, how many ghetto markets have a special counter in the deli section where they make fresh sushi, an extensive selection of wines, a large and clean produce department, organic foods, home goods, sporting goods, seasonal offerings, and even furniture?  I've never had an issue with service at this store. Also, I love the fact that in the past year or so, they've moved items that you need quickly, such as milk, eggs and butter to a display in the the front of the store.  Another nice feature is that they've now added a gas station to the front parking lot of the store and with the discounts offered for shopping at Fry's, the gas here is just as cheap as going to Costco.  Again, I think a lot of people are judging the store based on the fact that it is located on 19th Avenue and that the clientele don't all look like models. But really this is a much nicer store, with much better prices, than the Safeway at 7th Street and Glendale and quite honestly, it's actually nicer than a lot of other Fry's Marketplaces located throughout the valley.

If my memory is correct, this was the first Costco built in the Valley and it remains the standard by which all others should be judged.  In addition to the regular Costco merchandise, this store seems to get the best selection of special deals and traveling shows of any store in the Valley.   Plus, like many Costcos they have a gas station selling cheap gas and this store even has one of the best drive-through carwashes that I have found in the Valley.  Plus, its in North Scottsdale so tax rates are lower and there is no food tax like in Phoenix... and not only might you see celebrities or professional athletes while shopping, you can likely even get numerous references for plastic surgeons if that's on your list as well :-)  Enjoy!

For several years, I worked just across the 60 from this store, so since I was back in town I thought I'd stop by and check it out. First off, let me say that I'm a big fan of Bookmans and have been a customer since the days of the original store at Tucson Blvd and Broadway in Tucson.  As always, Bookmans has an impressive selection of books, magazines, DVDs, music, video games. They've also now started selling used musical instruments. But what most impressed me was the new paint scheme and the addition of a coffee bar and seating area.  Glad to see this Bookmans is still doing well!

This is far and away the best Circle K in the Valley!  Caveat, I'm not one who goes to Circle K for gas because I dislike paying inflated gas prices,   However, if you don't need to get you car filled up, this is the place to go. It's basically a small gourmet market branded as a Circle K. There's an excellent selection of snack foods, sodas, waters, hot dogs, etc, but what sets this location apart is its selection of beer and wine and its always friendly service.   Headed to a swanky dinner party in Scottsdale and forget to take a bottle of wine for the hostess? In town for Spring Training and want to stock up your hotel room? Or just want something quick and don't feel like stopping at one of those big box liquor stores, well head in here and get what you need.  Definitely recommended!

I don't really get Big 5 Sporting Goods. They advertise low prices, but when you go in they seem to only carry last season's styles. It almost seems like they are a sporting goods outlet. That being said, if you don't need the latest styles this is a good place to go and for basics like workout shirts and shorts. Plus, the clearance racks will often have the stuff you wanted a few years ago but might not have felt like paying full price for.   As for sporting goods, the problem is that the name-brand stuff isn't that much cheaper than going to a store like Sports Authority, Sports Chalet, or Dick's.  Overall, it's worth a visit, but don't set your expectations too high.

Here's the difference between Circle K and QuikTrip. When QuikTrip is busy all of the employees will drop everything and run registers until the customers have been served and the line is gone. Then employees who were on breaks or doing something else will return to what they were doing. On the other hand, when Circle K is busy one employee will slowly check people out while the line builds and the other employee will stay outside for her entire 10 or 15 minute smoke break which is clearly more important than customer service. Unfortunately this is the closest convenience store to my work so as much as I try to avoid it, sometimes I can't. Oh, and the parking is terrible. Be prepared to park on the dirt lot and risk dinging up your car because all of the spots are usually full... and considering how long it takes to check it out, it's takes too long to wait for a paved spot.

The first clue that this is more than just a regular grocery store is when you pull into the parking lot and notice the covered parking and the free valet parking. But then again, what do you expect of a store located right next to Paradise Valley where you're likely to run into a professional athlete, Hollywood star, or just a CEO worth a billion dollars or so?  Once inside, you'll see that this store has an amazing selection of produce, meats, cheeses, organic items and other groceries. But it also has a large section of home goods, decorations, bath and other grooming items, and other drugstore-type goods.  And the nice part is, that other than a few specialty items, you won't pay any more than you would at your regular Fry's.  So if you're in the mood to add a little luxury to your boring old grocery shopping, head over to this Fry's Marketplace!

If you're tired of overpaying for clothes, shoes, or other athletic gear at sporting goods store, you may want to check out the Nike Factory Store. No, the selection is not what you will find at Sports Authority, Dick's, and certainly not a Niketown, but they tend to have a lot of basic gear. If you can handle some strange colors, or just settle for basic black, you're likely to do well here and save a lot of money on your workout attire. It's definitely worth the drive to Arizona Mills.

The Vitamin Shoppe is like a candy store to me and it is my favorite place to shop for the vitamins and supplements that can help maintain your health and reach your peak performance.  Staff members are always friendly and helpful and they actually seem to have knowledge about the products. Plus, the sale table is always fun and often lets you try something new for just a little cash.  Unlike Hi-Health, the staff doesn't try to push you toward the house brands and unlike GNC, the supplements aren't overpriced.  If you're looking for supplements, The Vitamin Shoppe is the place to go.

Another great service experience at a Discount Tire location!  I called on Saturday morning to see if I could make an appointment to get my tires rotated and they asked how soon I could get there.   When I arrived, they met me in the parking lot, greeted my by name, and got my car into the bay immediately.   Less than 20 minutes later I was on my way with freshly rotated tires and a reminder of why I never buy tires anywhere other than Discount!

Like all QT's they have a large gas station, a great selection of stuff, and excellent service. But what really makes this location stand out to me was recently when we came home from a play and the sitter told us that our 11-year-old had lost a tooth that evening. Oh no,  10:30 at night is a tough time to call the tooth fairy and I started thinking about my options. Grocery stores rarely have dollar coins so my first thought was the Post Office because you can get dollar coins in change from the stamp machines. However first I needed to drive the sitter home and then put some gas in the car, so after getting her home safely I stopped at QT and filled up. On a lark I decided to go in, get a Gatorade and ask if they had any dollar coins. Amazingly, they not only did, but they asked how many I'd like. Knowing that the tooth fairy might need assistance again in the future, I changed a five and my son was very happy when he woke up in the morning and looked under his pillow. Thanks for saving the day QT!

After the last bad experience I had with Best Brothers Lawnmower Repair I looked around to see what else was available and came across Besco. This is a small shop owned and operated by a husband and wife couple. When I took my mower in, the communication was great. They took the time to listen to what I wanted and gave me a reasonable price for the work I needed. They promised me that I would have my mower back in less than two weeks and noted that they even provide pickup and delivery service at no added cost. Amazingly, only one week later they called to let me know that it was ready. As we were heading out of town for the weekend, I declined the offer to have it delivered later in the day and headed to pick it up. Not only was it done quickly, but the cost came to even less than they had estimated. All in all, this was a great experience and I highly recommend Besco. I know it's where I will be going from now on when my lawnmower needs service!

I'd heard so many good things about St. Francis and was excited to try it out, but unfortunately I was quite disappointed. Service was extremely slow, in fact our waitress disappeared for long periods of time and I had to flag down other servers to get refills, ask questions, and even try to find out where our food was. Not that it's the restaurants fault, but apparently it was prom season and we were seated in the midst of a large group of very loud high school kids. The food was good, but not great, and definitely worth the prices they are charging. Overall, it seems like the buzz around this place is overblown for the reality of the experience. I probably won't be back.

There's a difference between stores with no service, stores with good service, and stores with overbearing service. Best Buy is one of those stores with overbearing service. Stop for just a second to look at any piece of merchandise and you will be accosted by an overeager salesperson ready to tell you all about it, show you something similar, or just ask if they can help. And apparently somehow, they have been immunized to the magic words "I'm just browsing". As much as I appreciate the offers of help, and compared to some stores where you can't find anyone it's a nice change, Best Buy just overdoes it. Sorry, but when I say that I'm just browsing for ideas, I don't somebody trying to sell me something or direct me to something that I don't even know if I want.   Best Buy... best leave me alone.

I hadn't been here since they renovated the shopping center, so I stopped by to check it out the other day. Wow! The store is now three times as big as it used to be and has a great selection of used men's clothing.   This is the place to come if you want to wear designer styles without paying designer prices. Whether its a designer suit and shirt and tie combo you seek or the Scottsdale uniform of a Tommy Bahama shirt and a pair of golf shorts, this is the place to find it.  Great selection, great prices and a great place to go!

Full disclosure, nearly 30-years after being a member of my high school cross country and track teams I am working on getting back into running, but right now a 5K is about the extent of my distance; I haven't been on my bicycle in a couple of years and haven't ridden seriously in over 20; and I hate swimming, so I am about as far from being a triathlete as you can imagine.  That being said, I love this store!  Yes, most of the stuff is geared to people who are serious about triathlons, but they don't act like you're stupid if that's not what you do and its fun to look. Today's road bikes look nothing like I remember, but they certainly look fast!  I ended up talking with Julie, who as I later realized, actually owns this place with her husband. She took the time to tell me about the weekly running and biking groups they sponsor and the fitness classes offered at the store. Also, since it turned out that we have kids who are about the same age, she showed me the brochures from the groups that sponsor kids race and triathlons. And she let me know that I'm not the only person who the swimming scares away from tri-ing (pun intended).  Additionally, the store has an excellent selection of bikes, running gear, competitive swimwear, energy gels, drinks, and bars.   So whether or not you're a serious triathlete, a beginner, or just someone who's looking to get more active, you should definitely join the Tribe!

I don't know what's going on with the management of this location, but it seems to be going downhill quickly.  We stopped in last night for what should have been a quick bite on our way to the theater. However, what would have been a quick bite turned into a long time waiting for our food. And it wasn't just us, everyone around us was commenting on how long it was taking for food to come out of the kitchen. Now, since it's open, I could that there were plenty of people back there so I'm not sure why it took so long, but it certainly did.  Now, if you're going to compete in the fast, casual, restaurant market, you need to nail the fast part. When this Pei Wei was new, maybe they could get away with it, seeing as the only nearby competition was the (now gone) My Florist Cafe, but now that there is a Habit Burger, Chipotle, Pot Belly Sandwiches, and On a Roll within walking distance the management of Pei Wei need to get their act together.   Also, the last time we were at this location, they completely screwed up our order and brought us the wrong dishes.  Get it together Pei Wei!

I hadn't been to Johnnie's in about 6-years, but after my kids finished their swim lessons today I wanted to take them somewhere for lunch other than Mickey D's.   As we hopped into the car, I remembered that Johnnie's was close and knowing that the kids would go for hot dogs we headed over.  Unfortunately, my 2-year-old fell asleep right as we got there, so I carried him in with me - ordered myself a jumbo red hot and a basic dog with ketchup for my 5-year-old.   Back when I worked on Central Avenue, it always used to amuse me how this little hole-in-the-wall gets such a professional crowd, and apparently it still does because we were the only non-business types there for lunch.  My son enjoyed his hot dog and fries and I enjoyed mine as well - even while holding a sleeping 2-year-old in my arms.  The place gets 4-stars because not only is the food great, because even though they don't have servers, the female owner (of the cute Asian couple referenced in Tammi's review) saw that my hands were full with two children and not only brought the food to our table but also brought us a glass of water after my 5-year-old changed his mind about not getting a drink.

Summertime got you down? Need a place to cool off? Then head on up to the Foothills Recreation and Aquatics Center. Sure, you'll pay a dollar or two more if you're not a Glendale resident, but its still far cheaper than the commercial waterparks.  Once you get there, grab a tube and float around the lazy river, slide down one of two water slides, squirt someone with water, swim in the lap pool, or jump off the diving boards. With plenty of lifeguards and lots of room in the pool and on the deck, this is a great way to cool off from the Arizona sun.  Family friendly and affordable - Highly recommended!

Overpriced, slow service, and disgusting food.  The concept is good, sliders made from different types of meat, including exotic animals, but the execution is poor.'  The bartender asked if I'd been there before and when I said that I had not, he explained the concept and left me with the menu... for a good ten minutes. True, I hadn't been there before, but how long does it take to decide on a choice of sliders. I've had the same concept at food trucks and am able to make a decision. I'd think that he got busy, but later I overheard him telling a server that a different table was composed of repeat customers so they wouldn't need as long to order. Heck, if Chino Bandido can explain a much more complicated menu in less than 5 minutes, I'm pretty sure people can figure out what type of burger they want.  I ordered three sliders, buffalo, beef, and the exotic meat of the day, ostrich. I also ordered a side of sweet potato tater tots. Then I waited... and waited. Eventually, the tater tots arrived... in a serving that was far too big for one person. I ate some of them while waiting for my main course.  Finally the sliders arrived. The buffalo slider was far and away the best. Although as anyone who's been to Carl's Jr knows, practically any burger can be good when its slathered in barbeque sauce and topped with an onion ring. The beef burger was just meh, no better than you would find in any other burger place. But the ostrich slider was absolutely disgusting. The meat was bitter and tasted overcooked. I've had ostrich before and never had this type of reaction... it almost made me throw up.  When the bartender noticed that I was done, he set my bill down saying that way I wouldn't be waiting on him... which would have been great except that it took him a good 10 minutes to pick it up and run my credit card. Also, lunch for one person, with three sliders, tater tots, and a soda came out to $26. Seriously, for ONE PERSON???  Don't waste your time here. Sorry, Stax, but you don't stack up to the competition.

I don't actually hunt or fish, but after visiting this place, I'd like to take up those activities. This place is like a giant outdoors amusement park. Everything you could possibly want for outdoor activities is included in this store. I could spend hours in this store just looking at everything they have available. Plus, now I know where to buy the furniture if I ever get a hunting lodge.

Why is it that despite the fact that my house in North Central Phoenix is located right across the street from a large synagogue, it seems that I have to drive to the East Valley to find a good Jewish deli and bagelry.  Chompie's has an overwhelmingly large menu and the service by many young college girls that they employ as waitresses is very eager and friendly. The food has always been good and the price is fair because of the overwhelming quantity of food that you receive.  We stopped in yesterday for lunch after visiting the ASU Art Museum for Family Fun Day. My wife had a large bowl of split pea soup, the kids split a chicken fingers and a chocolate-chip bagel and I had the Mitch's Brooklyner sandwich which is a three layer sandwich consisting of pastrami, corned beef and brisket on rye.  The other thing I love is that Chompie's is one of the few places that still sells salt bagels which are my favorite.  Now I'm not Jewish and I'm not from New York, so I'm sure that there are those who would disagree, but Chompie's is far and away the best option for a deli and bakery that I have found in the Valley.

Nice new gym - lots of machines, big basketball gym, pool, and a good childcare. Everything is nice and clean and new. The employees are friendly and it doesn't get overly crowded. My only drawback is that the Group X room is kind of long and narrow and seems a little small. Other than that, I'm a fan.

Conveniently located just off the light rail, this Super Target is the antithesis of the Super Wal-Mart located at the other end of Chris-Town Mall, which is to say its clean, organized, well-stocked, a parking lot that's not a nightmare, and helpful employees.  With a great selection of groceries, clothing, housewares, toys, electronics, books, and music, this Super Target has everything for your shopping needs. It even has a pharmacy, snack bar, and a coffee shop in front.   If you're looking for a Big Box store on this side of town, this is the one to choose.

I'm never sure if people rag on the fair because of the location, because they are snobs, are just because they've never tried it, but it annoys me when I read reviews of people who clearly have never even been but dislike it because of where it is located or the demographics or the ethnicity of the people who attend.  We've been to the fair numerous times over the years and never had a bad experience. Yes, it can get crowded on weekend nights, but its a lot of fun and an inexpensive way to see some good concerts.   In addition to the State Fair, the fairgrounds is also home to lots of other events including the annual Junior League of Phoenix Rummage Sale, numerous gun shows, and special events in the Coliseum.  Unlike other states or cities where the fairground is located far out of the metropolitan area and requires a long drive to visit, we are lucky to have a facility like this so close to the central city.

It's sort of a tradition for us to attend the Tempe Arts Festival. There's lots of stuff to look at and buy. You can find everything from art pieces costing tens of thousands of dollars to small craft presents costing just a few dollars. And being that the Fall Festival always takes place just before Christmas its a great place to find unique gifts for friends and family. There's even an entire section devoted  to food items that you can't find elsewhere and a kids section with crafts and games. Plus, there's tons of entertainment for all ages including jugglers, bands, dancers, musicians, and other things.   If you want to avoid the hassle of parking, just take the light rail to Mill Avenue, but even if you drive, there are plenty of garages and surface lots available for a small fee.  Enjoy!

Running a big corporate gym is tricky because gymrats are tribal and you've got to appeal to all the various tribes without making people feel uncomfortable.   That's why I'm so impressed with this 24 Hour Fitness... for the bodybuilders looking to get swole there is a large free weight area; cardio fans have their choice of treadmills, ellipticals, stairmasters, and stationary bicycles; there's a dedicated room for spin class; group exercise fans can choose from Zumba, Turbo Kick, and the Les Mills BodyPump, BodyCombat, and BodyAttack; and yoginis are offered several yoga courses throughout the week. I do wish they'd kept the Run Club going, but it may be back in the fall.  Other on-site features include a large pool, jacuzzi, steam room, and sauna. They even have a chiropractor on site with massage therapists and child care that my kids really like.  As some have stated, this is an older facility that originally started out as The Q, but even so they have done a good job of keeping it up and making it feel modern.  As someone who likes to mix things up by doing a variety of workouts, I'm happy to consider 24 Hour Fitness - Scottsdale as my primary gym.

I don't get the love for Z'Tejas.Yes, its better than chains like On the Border, Chevy's, or Olive Garden but its still a chain and really nothing special. The appetizers aren't bad, but nothing on the menu blows my socks off.   The atmosphere is, well what atmosphere? It's just kind of a generic restaurant. Plus the servers seem so artificially peppy that I'm tempted to ask if they are wearing the requisite amount of flair... I know, I know, they don't actually wear flair, but it has that feel.  Plus, I hate it when the manager is clearly tasked with going around to every table and checking on your meal. Do it because you care, not just because its a required part of the job.  Both the waiter and the manager came around numerous times during our meal and the question was always "Is everything great!" I wanted to respond that you both keep walking up at inopportune times and interrupting our conversation, so no its not great now, but I was with coworkers and decided to be his nice.  That being said, with so many other good restaurants nearby, I see no reason to go back to Z'Tejas anytime soon.

This is really the only full-service sporting goods store in Central Phoenix and from workout attire, to basketball hoops, to skis, even to kayaks, it carries everything you could possibly need. Also, I haven't had any issues with service as described by other reviewers.  My only fear is whether or not this store will stay in business because it never seems to be very busy. And while that's great for parking, because the parking lot was always kind of a nightmare when it was an Albertson's, it does concern me that if they close I will have to start driving much further again for my athletic needs.

It's not the worst Walmart I've ever seen (ChrisTown), but it's certainly not the best. However, if you're in the area and you need basics, it's not a terrible option... although if you drive a little further to 44th St there is a Target that is better by far.  What else can I say?

It's a Costco so what else do I have to say. Great prices, great products, a food court with pizza or hot dogs if you're hungry, cheapest gas in the area, I've been a Costco (Price Club) member since 1981 and I've shopped at different ones all over the country so its nice to have one so close to my house. Kirkland products are just as good as the name brands and I can always find what I need here whether its food, clothes, home items, vitamins, sporting goods, electronics, jewelry, or practically anything else. In fact, if I could just shop in one store for the rest of my life it would be Costco. If you're not a member, you don't know what you're missing.

Little hole-in-the-wall pizza and sandwich place that reminds me of the way Scottsdale used to be before it went completely upscale. The pizza and meatball subs are delicious and reasonably priced and the staff is friendly. Definitely a great place to go and they even deliver if you live in the area.  Highly recommended!

Wow - good cheap basic pizza!   My wife and I stopped yesterday for the $4, two slices and a soda special. We both had pepperoni and it was extremely tasty and filling.  I'll definitely be back and If I worked nearby, I'd probably be a lunch regular.

Discount Tire is an example of how well a business can be run if you provide great service and treat your customers fairly.  I noticed one of the tires was low on my wife's SUV as I was about to drive up to the White Mountains for the 4th of July so I decided to stop at Discount Tire and have it checked. I pulled up to the free tire check station and the attendant noticed that one tire was low because it had a nail in it. However, he also recognized that the tire could be fixed, and best of all, they could do it for free.  They got me in right away and 20 minutes later, our tires were good as new and I was headed for the mountains. It wasn't until later that I remembered that my wife had actually bought those tires at Costco, not Discount.  As for me, I've bought all of my tires at Discount for the past 20 years and it has definitely been worthwhile. The service is great, the price is right, and the extra $15 for tire insurance has saved my bacon a few times when I've been able to replace an expensive tire for $15-20.  I wouldn't buy my tires anywhere else.

Great store and great staff! They sell all the shoes, clothes, and running gear you could want, but most importantly, they host the Adventure Run every month, and in the hot summer, one of the checkpoints is always Big Surf where you get the opportunity to take off your shoes and socks and your electronics and go down one of the big waterslides. Gotta say, when it's over 100 degrees, there's nothing like getting soaking wet and running. Plus after the run you get to drink a few beers and try to win prizes in the raffle. If you're a runner you definitely need to check this place out!

So I finally gave in and bought a membership at REI. While I still find prices on some items to be too high, there are some deals if you do your homework and they have an excellent return policy. Plus if you're going to spend the money anyway, you may as well get the members rebate.   Also, the annual garage sale where they sell returned items is fun, although it's totally hit or miss whether you'll find anything. I spent three hours waiting but wound with a pair of new Shimano pedals for my bike at a great price.  I have a feeling I'll be here a lot more in the future.

This is a surprisingly good TJ Maxx store... especially since they remodeled it in the last year or so. Sometimes when you hear the ads saying "name brand clothing" you wonder if they really mean names that you've heard of, but this store actually has them and is not just slapping labels with fake Italian designer names on cheap Chinese-made products.   Whether you're looking for clothing, accessories, gifts, or household items, swing by TJ Maxx and see what they have in stock, you might be surprised.

Sure its a chain, but they know their stuff and they do a great job outfitting runners in the appropriate shoes, attire, and other accessories. The Roadrunner brand gear is good quality and cheaper than the name brand merchandise. Plus, each month they host an Adventure Run, basically a free scavenger hunt run where you visit nearby businesses, get raffle tickets, and have the chance to win drawings for free merchandise, race entries, and gift certificates from Roadrunner and other businesses. It's a fun, easy way to run and meet fellow runners (including quite a few Yelpers). Also, pro-tip, if you're not yet a VIP member, tell them you want the internet price, even in-store, and you can join for $1.99.

We held a regional training here recently and I was surprised how many attendees had never visited before as I've been visiting ever since SkySong was built and have seen it grow from one building to now three, with more on the way.  As the home of ASU Venture Capital efforts, SkySong is both an academic setting and a business location so you get an interesting mix of internet tech types and business suited corporate types.   However, they're all working in an amazing location with the latest technology, amazingly designed workspaces, and great meeting and conference rooms. Plus there is a coffee shop with great coffee and food and you're really close to both Old Town Scottsdale and Downtown Tempe.   Heck, if you want to you can even rent an apartment in one of the new buildings right next door and spend all your time here.  Sure turned out better than the Coyotes Arena they originally wanted to put on this site... didn't it Glendale?

This is a hidden little gem in the Valley art scene. We've been here a few times for family fun day and on other occasions it's always a good time for the kids with lots of activities and appearances by children's authors and PBS characters.  As for the exhibits, the ones on display when we've been there have perfectly fine, although I don't completely get the concept of grouping a Hogarth with Cuban art and other random pieces just because they include text.  It's a University art museum so the selection is a bit limited, but we have been impressed with their permanent collection as well as the ceramic exhibits which are just across the street from the main exhibit. While some of the art has mature themes, so does much of the greatest art from all times that are located in art museums all across the United States and Europe.  So is this museum appropriate for children? Well, I'd much rather expose my children to mature themes and pictures in an art museum than have them learn about them through friends or on the internet.

Around for 40 years, the Phoenix 10K and half marathon may be the oldest race in town. With just under 1,000 participants in the 1/2 it was busy but not to the point where you felt overwhelmed by the sheer number of people. This year's half marathon course started at Cityscape, looped around the Capitol, and then up Central past Camelback before heading back down Central to the finish line at 1st Ave and Washington. All in all a good, flat course with minimal elevation change that was a good place for my first half marathon.

This used to be the main Costco in Central Phoenix, but ever since the opening of the one at ChrisTown this is now the only Business Costco in the Valley. However, any Costco member can shop here even if you don't own a business and sometimes it is fun to do so.  This location reminds me of the way The Price Club / Costco was when it first started. Items are sold in bulk for use by businesses and restaurants. Individual items are packaged for resale. They don't have as many Kirkland brand items because no one would resell those in a convenience store. The cold area is huge, basically taking up the entire back corner of the store. If you have a restaurant or are just feeding large groups of people this is a place to go. Because they are designed for resale, they sell different types of soft drinks, energy drinks, candy, and other snacks than the regular Costco which is good when you want to switch things up. You can also get restaurant quality utensils, serving platters, and kitchen knives here.   And its not all just retail. They have office supplies galore, from paper to full-on cubicles.  If you haven't yet visited the Costco Business Center you should check it out!

I love the concept of this place, but the execution always seem to leave much to be desired. Yes, the burgers on pretzel buns are good, but the rest of the menu never seems to be that impressive. Also, the service always just seems to be just, meh. Sure, they'll take your order but then they often seem to disappear for most of your meal and getting refills or even your check can be an adventure.  With so many other good places in the area I don't know how The Lodge survives.

What could make this Walmart even worse than it already is? No, it's not your fellow shoppers, rather its the lousy attitudes of the staff at this store. From the b*tch who scanned my box of kitty litter and then pointed at it and said "I'm done with that" because she was too lazy to pick it up and put it back in my cart; the associate who was standing in the middle of the aisle complaining about having to put items back on shelves; or the staff manning the service desk who were arguing with customers about returned items this store has really gone downhill.   Sure, I can agree that Walmart employees may be underpaid, they don't get health insurance, and they are probably the butt of a lot of jokes, but hey, you have a job which is better than a lot of people these days and ultimately it's still a customer service job so perhaps you should be nice to the customers who are paying your salary.  I've shopped at other Walmarts where the employees are friendly and helpful but that's certainly not the case at this one.

You know it must be a good dentist shop when you not only like going, you look forward to it.  I've tried my fair share of dentists in the Valley - from the old guy who scraped my teeth like the Spanish Inquisition, to the groups who made you come back for a second appointment after the check-up just to get a cleaning... and to bill your insurance provider twice.  Luckily, now that I've found Simply Dentistry I don't have to go anywhere else. Dr. Bicki Tran and her staff take the time to get to know you, are friendly, and most importantly have the latest equipment and the skills to make your visit pleasant and pain-free.  If you're looking for a dentist that you won't dread or even just tolerate, but instead will actually enjoy, check out Simply Dentistry.

We've been taking our kids here since they were born and we've never had a bad experience. The doctors are caring and actually care about the kids. Yes, sometimes they seem rushed, but that's probably because its such a popular place and they've never failed to take the time to answer any questions or address any concerns you may have. Additionally, the nurses are very professional and take great care of our kids as well.  If you live in the Central Phoenix / Arcadia area, these are the pediatricians you want to see.

My rule of thumb is that you can tell what part of town you're in by whether or not the public restrooms have mirrors. If they have a piece of polished metal or worse yet, a concrete wall, then you're not in a good area. Old beat up or scratched mirrors, maybe slightly better.   But what about when you're in a place with public restrooms that look like you're at a 5-Star resort? Well that's a sign that you're in a really nice place, and that's what you find at the trailheads of the McDowell Sonoran Preserve in Scottsdale!  But enough about the bathrooms, do your business and get outside to see the beautifu scenery that makes you grateful to live in Arizona (or at least that you get the chance to visit). Take a hike or run around the Gateway Loop Trail, hike Tom's Thumb, or just sit and watch the wildlife. No matter what you do you'll be out in one of the most beautiful places, and one of the nicest spots, in the entire Valley of the Sun!

For those of you who've lived in Tucson, Pete's Fish and Chips is probably the closest thing to Lucky Wishbone that you can find in Phoenix.   Every once in a while I stop in and get myself some scallops, shrimp, or crabettes with fries. Yes it's all deep fried and probably not very healthy, but sometimes that hits the spot.  Oh and remember, it's cash only but they don't take anything bigger than a $20!

It seems appropriate that my 500th review should be for a gym because when I'm not at home or work, the gym is probably where you will find me.  This 24 Hour Fitness is the nicest one I have ever seen. It probably helps that it was built from the ground up as a 24 Hour, and not retrofitted from another gym or another type of business. The gym itself is huge, with plenty of equipment even when it gets crowded. There are row upon row of cardio machines, weight machines, free weights, etc. There is a large Group X room with lots of equipment and sufficient weights, risers, and pads for even the largest classes. They have a separate spin room so that the bikes don't take up space in the other room. There is a full size basketball court with what looks to be some very competitive games happening at all times. There's a lap pool, jacuzzi, sauna, and steam room. The locker room is well appointed with plenty of space, nice big lockers, good showers and toilet facilities.  The people that work here are very nice and helpful. You can find personal trainers who specialize in everything from bodybuilding competitions to running clubs and they have an excellent selection of group exercise classes to take.  I should note that because this gym is located close to ASU, the bro factor can be high which may turn some people off. But really, if you just concentrate on your own workout it's nothing to worry about. Just go hard and next thing you know one of the bro's may be asking you for a spot.  So if you're looking for a nice gym, check out 24 Hour Fitness at Mesa Riverfront. It's worth the drive.

Yes, it's on the Northwest side and its tucked into a non-descript strip mall better known for being the home of Padre Murphy's Sports Bar, but don't let appearances fool you, this is a great gym. The gym offers a large selection of cardio equipment, weight machines, free weights, and group exercise classes. It also has a pool, hot tub, sauna, and steam room. But will really makes this gym special is its kids care facility. It has video games, pop-a-shot, and a giant climbing structure that my kids like so much, they are begging to go to the gym... and it's a lot easier to get a workout done when the kids are excited about going!  Definitely a great find and well worth the drive to the Northwest side.

It's great to know that right in the center of the nation's 5th largest city you can get back to nature with this incredible running, walking, and biking path. Now I've never actually seen anyone ride a horse down the bridle path but apparently its allowed. I have seen plenty of people running, walking and biking and I've even been one myself many times. A couple of hints: 1 - the path is not lit so if you go early in the morning or late in the evening, take a light; 2 - if you don't live close enough to walk or bike there, park your car in the North Phoenix Baptist Church lot at Central and Bethany  Home road while you exercise; 3 - there is no poop fairy so if you bring your dog, please bag and take his waste.  But most of all, enjoy the opportunity to visit this great feature in the best part of town!

These guys are great. We were here recently because Dr. Rhorer and Dr. Staples are both Eagle Scouts and they took the time out of their personal lives to come in on a Saturday and lead a group of Boy Scouts, including my son, through the requirements of the Medicine Merit Badge. In fact, other members of the clinic were there as well and not only did my son learn about the history of medicine, but they even got to use the real tools that doctors practice with and learn how to set bones and attach plates in the same way that the real doctors do.  You can tell just from the way that the doctors interacted with the Scouts that they care about their jobs and their patients. Based on this experience I would not hesitate to recommend this group to anyone who needs to see them for a medical issue.

I had an excellent experience with this dealership.  I identified the vehicle I wanted, a 2007 Kia Sportage, via one of the mobile car-buying apps and contacted the dealership. Shortly after doing so I received a phone call that the car was still available and made arrangements to head over after work. My salesman, Wayne, was very professional and helpful. He let me know that the vehicle had just been traded in so it wasn't yet clean and hadn't been fully checked by the shop, but that based on the initial review he felt it was in good shape.   Following the test drive, we began talking about the vehicle. I was looking to trade in my 2003 Kia Optima and had done my research on its value. Wayne didn't try to lowball me, but made me a fair offer that I accepted. We negotiated a deal for the Sportage contingent upon it passing its mechanical inspection. They also threw in a year of free oil changes and I went with the extended warranty as the original factory warranty had already expired.   I also really appreciated the lady in the finance department who gave me an estimate on the loan interest rate but told me she would shop around and try to find a better rate. Clearly she did her job because my loan ended up with a Credit Union at a lower monthly payment than we discussed.  Because the Sportage was not ready that night. I made plans to come back the next day and pick it up. Although I did have to wait a bit the next evening for the detailing to be completed, I now have a great vehicle that allows me to get around without worries and go camping with my two boys in both Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts.  I was very impressed with the straightforwardness and professionalism of the staff at this dealership.

Super friendly service - even when you're looking for something they don't carry.  I stopped in a few weeks to see if they had the spray you can use to clean your yoga mat. It turns out they don't carry it, but not only did they give me some other ideas on how to clean my mat, they called several studios and retail stores until we found it available at Whole Foods.  Yes the clothes are pricey, but the men's clothes I have are well made and very comfortable.  And lets not overlook the best element of all... Ladies, if you want your ass to look incredible, get yourself a pair of Lululemon yoga pants. You'll feel more confident, your special someone will appreciate it, and if you don't have a special someone these pants might help you get one.  Seriously, I think there is some black magic that goes into the making of Lululemon yoga pants... but as a red-blooded American guy, I'm certainly not complaining!

Now under new management, you can feel free to ignore the previous bad reviews.   I was extremely pleased with my visit to Airpark Tint. I purchased a deal on Living Social to have my four side windows and the back window of my car tinted. Setting an appointment was extremely easy. I dropped my car off in the morning and had it back in just a few hours. Customer service was easy and very friendly.  The tint looks great and not only makes my car look much cooler, but should keep it much cooler in the summer. Apparently they also do mobile tinting and will come to your location to tint your vehicle.  If you're looking to get windows tinted, Airpark Tint is the place to go.

While I'm not a huge fan of their religious beliefs and the application of that to the health insurance they offer employees, I suppose if you take a job their that is your choice and you know what you are getting.   With that disclaimer out of the way, they have an amazing selection of craft and hobby items at better prices than almost everywhere else. Typically my wife is the one doing these activities, but with one child still in Cub Scouts, I have to get involved at least once a year when we build his Pinewood Derby car. They have a great selection of wood blocks, wheels, accessories, weights, axle polishing kits, and model paint. If you really wanted to go all out, you could probably go crazy building a car here. I try to get the items we need, convince the kids that they don't need another science set or more dinosaur toys, and get home to start building the car.  The other great service they have is that if you buy a picture frame, they will put your picture in it for no charge. I recently went to reframe my college diplomas and while a custom frame would have been around $350, I found two nice frames for $15 each and had them put my diplomas in them so they were nice and straight. Now they look great hanging on the wall of my office and sometimes I glance over at them to remind myself that I really do have a Master's degree... especially when I'm doing something so basic it could make me forget.  Finally, before you check out, get on your phone and Google "Hobby Lobby coupon". There's pretty much always a 40% off coupon you can use to bring down the price on your most expensive item.  And remember, Hobby Lobby is closed on Sundays, so if you need something, remember to get it during the other 6 days in the week.

I am not a CrossFitter... I have not fully bought into the cult of CrossFit, I am not one to talk about the WOD,  my AMRAP results, my PRs, PBs, or my time to complete Fran, Annie, or Murph. That being said, if you are a hardcore CrossFitter this is a box you want to visit where you can go Beast Mode to your heart's content.  As for me, I consider myself an athlete and I like to change things up, so I signed up for a 6-week challenge to see how I could do. For those who are unaware, CrossFit is a mix of Olympic Weightlifting, gymnastics, running, and rowing that gets your heart rate pumping and then has you lift heavy weights in ways that stimulate your largest muscle groups which in turn gives you a complete full body workout.  Additionally the workout changes everyday creating the aforementioned WOD, or Workout of the Day, and ensuring that your muscles don't get accustomed to the same efforts and you don't plateau. Also, the workouts are scalable which means that each person lifts the amount they want and you're not competing with other people, just with yourself.  The other thing that sets this box (that's gym in CrossFit lingo) apart is the coaches. Chayet was an awesome trainer who truly knows his stuff and has trained and competed at various places across the country. And if you're going to do Olympic lifts, who better to show you than an actual Olympian. Luz Acosta teaches what she learned when she competed for Mexico in the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics and finished in 6th place in the world. She may not look like it, but she's probably the strongest person I've ever met.  Finally, the owner, Gayle Shalloo, provides great encouragement and kept us active and involved throughout the challenge, not just with physical activity but also by providing a paleo diet plan to follow and weekly encouragement.  So how did it go? Well I dropped from 200 to 186 lbs and took my body fat down 6%, from 23.6% to 17.6%. I also learned a lot of new exercises, started some new eating habits, and made some new friends.  So whether you're a seasoned CrossFitter or just a newbie looking to get in better shape, CrossFit Full Strength is a great place for you.

Apparently developers have decided that the outdoor shopping mall is going to replace indoor malls, which is great when it's not summertime in Arizona. Even so the high (three story) buildings at Scottsdale Quarter provide enough shade that you can still go there in the heat.    While it's mostly national chains, it goes to four stars because of the inclusion of some local restaurants and the Valley's only Nike Store. It also includes one of two Lululemon stores in the Valley, an Apple store, plus chains like H & M, Urban Outfitters, and others.  The parking garages at each end of the strip are convenient and spots are generally available although I'm sure they are crowded during the holidays.  All in all, a nice shopping addition to North Scottsdale.

For some reason I got on this store's email list, so I decided to stop in and see what they carry. Afterwards I looked at the reviews and was surprised to see all of the complaints because they were very nice when I stopped in. Plus, as a guy its cool to know that Amy, the eponymous owner of the store, is the daughter of Milwaukee Brewer's great Robin Yount and this explains why the story carries bedazzled baseball hats which are perfect for women who are baseball fans. They also had a great selection of jeans, tops, and dresses. Certainly, Amy Inc. is not a store for everyone, but if you're in the market for a top of the line boutique with unique items that you can't find elsewhere, then check it out.   Oh, and if you don't act like a b*tch, you probably won't get treated like one.

So long spending hundreds of dollars on service calls to get my appliances fixed.   When our washing machine stopped spinning and wouldn't drain out the water I Googled the problem, watched a YouTube video about how to fix it, and then spent less than $30 for a replacement lid switch at the Appliance Parts Company, came home, installed the new switch, and had the washer back up and running in no time.  So glad there is a place where you can find these types of items!

Small, cramped, and serving the same disgusting chicken that this chain always has. Unfortunately, the KFC on Indian School is also a pit, so if you're craving fried chicken in South Scottsdale the only good option you have is LoLo's.  The second star is because the employees were nice.

Another great new location from the Corieri's, creators of Axis/Radius, Suede Lounge, Myst, Sandbar and, for those who remember, Jetz and Stixx.  RnR is located in a brand new building on the South edge of Oldtown Scottsdale and right across the street from the former Billet Bar (I don't know its new name). The atmosphere is your typical Scottsdale eatery/sports bar. Big flatscreen TV's, large bar and lots of attractive people in designer jeans. There's both indoor and outdoor seating and its definitely a place to start the night before heading out for the Scottsdale club scene.  The service was quick and very good. I had the sirloin steak sandwich with sweet potato fries while others in my party tried various burgers and salads. My sandwich was excellent and others enjoyed their food as well. The fries are served in a small bucket and reminded me of the ones at Delux Burger.  The only reason RnR loses a star is that once the football game ended, the music was turned up so loud that it was practically impossible to hear the people at my own table.   I can see turning up the music later in the evening, but we were there on Sunday night and the NFL playoff game ended at about 6:00 which still strikes me as the dinner hour and it was disconcerting to have the music get so loud so early.

Quite often I'm asked "Brad, how do you always look so good and appear so well put together?" Once we get past the basics of good breeding, charisma, and manners, we generally get to the point that having well-fitting clothing can make anyone look better. That's why I always encourage people to find the best alterations tailor in your area. Good tailoring can make a cheap $500 suit look better than a poorly fitting $5,000 suit, and if you know your basic sizes you can find high quality items online or in resale shops and have them altered so they look like they were cut just for you.   Every time I've come in here I've been treated very well. They measure my clothing they way I want it and they complete the work very quickly, generally within a week or so. In fact I even took my oldest son in last year and even though he's tall and skinny they were able to alter his blue blazer and gray slacks so that he looked great and wasn't swimming in it when he went to Junior Assembly.  If you want to look your best, keep your eye on The Fit!

In Phoenix for the weekend and met some friends here for a birthday celebration. I've heard about the original Vig and have been excited to know that one was coming to North Central. The reputation did not disappoint. The building is beautiful, the parking lot is full of expensive cars and the place is full of beautiful people eating, drinking and playing bocce ball. No ironic hipsters here drinking PBR, this is a place where you want to be in shape, dress up and head out for a fun night. They even have a "Vig Rig" to give rides to from the bar to people who've had too much to drink. I was just there to socialize so I didn't get a chance to try the food, but friends said it was good.   Its exciting to see a new place like this in the area and nice to know that good restaurants and bars can continue to succeed and thrive in Central Phoenix.

Extremely well organized event, lots of fun, and benefiting a great cause. This was my first year doing Pat's Run and I was little nervous when I realized that nearly 28,000 runner and walkers were entered, but it couldn't have gone smoother. Everyone is sorted into starting groups, and assuming you accurately estimated your time, it works quite well. Yes, there are always those people who overestimate the pace they can maintain, but it's not the Olympics so don't worry about it. There's plenty of room on the course to get around slower runners.  The ending is cool because you get to run out onto the field at Sun Devil Stadium. I suppose since Pat Tillman played defense, it would be even cooler if you had to avoid a linebacker while getting to the finish line, but I digress.  After the main race, there is a huge expo taking place with lots of sponsors giving away free stuff. There's also a giant kids expo with inflatables, arts and crafts, and representatives from all the local sports teams. There's even a kids race that I plan to take my kids to next year.  All in all, whether you're a competitive runner, a jogger, a walker, or even just a cheerleader, Pat's Run is an event you don't want to miss.

This ain't your daddy's hot dog cart! No sirree Bob, if you're looking for Vienna franks boiled in dirty water, steamed buns, and French's mustard you may want to keep driving.  However, if you're looking for a gourmet experience where loving care is paid to  every dog they cook, then this is your place. Hot dogs with gouda cheese, bacon, and even peanut butter as toppings. I had the bacon-wrapped bockwurst with german potato salad and it was delicious. Even the kids dogs with basic ketchup and mustard are wrapped in a pita rather than a bun and my boys really enjoyed them.  Additionally, at least at the Central and Camelback location they have a firepit and sell Smores kits which made my boys very happy and will be enjoyed by adults as well.  Finally, the service was great! Despite the crowds, service was friendly, attentive, and very prompt - which is something you don't always find at food trucks.  Short Leash Dogs - we will be back!

It was my son's 8th birthday, but with just my wife, his 5-year-old brother and myself to celebrate we certainly didn't need a full cake, So instead we decided to stop here and let everyone pick out their own cupcake. We had chocolate, vanilla, lemon and even red velvet. The kids thought the cupcakes were yummy and my wife and I agreed that they are much better than Sprinkles - where they use a very heavy batter.  As a family owned and run shop, the service was very friendly and we talked about how many new businesses are going in at the intersection of Bethany and 16th Street. With new bars, restaurants, shops, a gym and even a kids gymnastic business, it's really becoming one of the gems of North Central Phoenix. Having a delicious cupcake shop is just an added benefit!  Plus, they don't just do cupcakes, they can do full cakes for weddings, birthday parties, anniversaries and they'll even do character cupcakes.   This is a local business I am proud to support.

Wait, a restaurant with a seasonally changing menu and your entire plate comes in under 475 calories and it's not some weird little hippy place in a strip mall? Yep, that Seasons 52.  I'd heard great things about this place and so when I was in Phoenix for a few days and had the chance for date night with my wife, I jumped at the opportunity to check it out.  We got there about 6:00 on Friday night and the hostess told us that it would be a 45-minute wait for a table, but that if we wanted to eat in the piano bar, we could grab a booth or barstool right away and still order from the full menu. Well say piano bar, and you don't have to ask me twice! We took a booth and settled in to enjoy the sounds of the piano player and check out the menu.  Our server was extremely helpful and told us about the concept and that they would be switching to the Spring Menu in another week or so.  We started with an appetizer of Chipotle Shrimp which had four large grilled shrimp in a very tasty sauce.  I ordered the Salmon which was grilled on a wood plank and came with asparagus and carrots. My wife had the grilled Mahi-Mahi with vegetables. Both meals were incredible!  The final part of the meal is dessert. Wait, dessert at a place that's supposed to be healthy? Yes, it's true! The desserts are not large, in fact the entire serving comes in a shot glass. My wife had the key lime pie and I tried the Rocky Road. The taste was amazing, and the small size just made you savor it more and gave you enough of the flavor to satisfy any craving you might have without feeling overstuffed.  Now as to the restaurant itself, the place is beautiful! First of all, its at Biltmore Fashion Park so that tells you right away that this is a place you want to be. There is a large dining room and a back room. Everything is done in nice light wood and it has a modern, yet traditional feel. The bar area sort of reminded me of the way the old Houston's used to be set up across the street at the Esplanade and I love the fact that they had a live piano player.  Overall I can't say enough good things about Seasons 52. If I was in Phoenix full-time I would make this a regular hangout!

Finally a Nike store in the Valley!!!  Sure, it's not a NikeTown so you don't have four floors of stuff the way you do in San Francisco or LA, but its got more than almost any other place and when you think about how much Nike gear is available through other outlets like department stores, sporting goods stores, and even Nike outlets, it's hard to complain.  The store personnel were very nice and the store has an excellent selection of running gear, workout attire, casual wear, golf clothing, and even the new Nike NFL line.  Sure, it's full price, but that's what you get for buying directly from the company.  Just Do It!

Got off the plane from Sacramento and my buddy who picked me up at the airport suggested we stop here for a drink to catch up. What a great new addition to North Central.16th Street and Bethany Home is really turning into a hot spot with Phoenix Grille,The Vig Uptown and now Garage!  I can't review the food because we just had a couple of drinks but the bartender was very nice and the space is amazing. They've kept the big garage doors which can open to the patio in nice weather. The interior is spacious and open with a big bar and plenty of tables and booths for seating. There's even a fireplace which had a roaring fire going which was perfect for this time of year.  Definitely a great addition to this part of town!

Some people say that Lululemon is a cult because the founder encourages people to live up to their potential, but I say its a cult because they make some of the best exercise clothing out there and once you wear it you'll want to join the cult as well.  Sure, its expensive, but they do have sales and considering the work that you probably put into your workout, buying clothes that work, look great, and will last is well worth it.  This location is easy to find in the Scottsdale Quarter, sales associates are very friendly, and like all Lululemon stores it offers weekly free yoga classes.  So whether you're a Yoga veteran or a beginner like me, go check out Lululemon at the Quarter and you'll probably walk away happy.  Namaste

I was out this way recently and was pleasantly surprised to find that this place is still in business and going strong... especially since I hadn't been there in 10 years and many restaurants do not make it.  They serve a wide variety of Asian foods, from all different countries, and while I'd always thought it was good, I was pleasantly surprised that my co-worker, who is Chinese and knows her Asian foods much better than I do, also thought it was good and even wanted to go back another day when we were working out that way.  If I still lived or worked in this part of the Valley I would come here more often, so if you do, take advantage of it!

Another great addition to Central Phoenix! Stopped in for dinner last weekend with my wife and absolutely loved this place. Pulling up it didn't look the big, but after the valet took our car and we saw the back patio, the bar, and the dining room we were quite impressed. We sat in the front room which is great and you can't even tell that you're right on Central Avenue. I had the Crab Cake BLT and my wife had the Picnic Kebobs. Both of us found our food to be delicious and the service was fast and attentive.   I want to go back again and try the ceviche and some of the specialty cocktails. I can definitely see hanging out at this place when I am home in Phoenix.

I came here with my work colleagues to celebrate a birthday. While it definitely has the feel of a "ladies who lunch" place, I was impressed that they made sure to give us timely service so that we could get back to the office within a reasonable time.  I had a chicken cobb salad while my colleagues tried other items on the menu. Everyone was very pleased with their selections and my fresh-squeezed lemonade was great as well Our server was excellent and even took the time to ask where we worked.  The only drawback I saw was that if you're going to have valet parking in Scottsdale, shouldn't it be complimentary? Almost everywhere else does it that way, so I wasn't sure why it cost $3 here.  Other than that though, this is definitely a place to go for a nice meal.

The old town, nightclub area of Scottsdale needed a sports bar/restaurant and Majerle's fills the bill. Food is good, prices are reasonable, and flatscreens are everywhere so you can watch any game that's on. I'm sure it gets crowded at night, but for a lunch spot its not too bad.  Oh, and like almost everywhere in Scottsdale, the serving staff is very attractive, but don't be that creepy old guy who moves to a different seat at the bar to get a better view of the bartender bending over in her tight shorts (yeah, I heard you dude... and so did she)!

Don't take their word for it when they tell you what's wrong with your car. I am a AAA member, so when my car broke down recently I let them tow it to their own facility. However, when they called with the estimate, I was a little nervous because it didn't seem like they knew what they were talking about, so I made a few other phone calls. Specifically, one of the things they wanted to replace was the cam sensor, because it was oil-soaked. My first red flag came when I called another place and they told me that because that sensor is right next to the cam shaft, it's supposed to be oil-soaked.   After checking it out with a few other places, I ended up taking my car to the dealership and having it fixed for $500 less than AAA wanted and without having extra, unnecessary work done.  I'll stay a AAA member for the towing, but this is not a place I can recommend.

I walked in and 45 minutes later walked out with a brand new Arizona drivers license. In California this would have taken 5 hours without an appointment and 2 1/2 with one. People who complain about the DMV clearly either haven't been in a while or have never experienced the hell of other states.  Great job Arizona - one of the few government services you get right!

Super friendly, fast service, and reasonable prices.  I've worn my Tag Heuer watch everyday for more than 12 years, so I thought it was high time to get it checked and cleaned.  I read great reviews of Gemtime, and since it is located very close to my office I stopped in at lunch. John, the son, took one look at my watch and said, we can take care of this for you and you'll have it back it tomorrow.  When I expressed concern that my wrist would feel funny without the familiar weight of a watch, he not only understood but even offered to let me take a loaner watch for the day if I wanted. (I decided I could survive one day, but if it had been a longer period I probably would have taken him up on the offer.)  When I picked up my watch, they had steam cleaned the case, put it in the ultrasonic cleaner, and polished it up so it looks like new. They even checked the seals and performed a pressure check to ensure that the inside of my dive watch is still sealed.  I had also noticed that my gym workouts are paying off and my wrists seem to be getting thicker which meant that my watch was getting tighter. Luckily I still have the links that I had taken out of the bracelet when I first got my watch, so I took those in and we added back a link to give the watch a better fit.   I would definitely recommend Gemtime as a great place to take your fine watches and jewelry. They know what they are doing, don't try to sell service you don't need, finish their work quickly, and provide great service!

The intersection of 7th Street and Glendale has gathered quite a few decent places to eat over the last five years or so. Pei Wei, Sauce and Qdoba on the North side of the street have now been joined by The Habit on the South side at a site that once held a sub sandwich shop and later, a local coffee house.  I ordered the double char burger and while it was not up the quality of burger found at Delux or RnR, it was better than most chains and just as good as anything found at Five Guys or Fuddruckers.   So, if you're looking for a quick place to get a burger and you want something better than McDonalds or Burger King, you could certainly do worse than taking up this Habit!

Tired of shopping for Indian jewelry and Arizona souvenirs in Old Town, well head on over to this amazing oasis right next door. Wander around and check out the fountains, the grass, and the public art, including an installation of Robert Indiana's famous LOVE sculpture. You'll immediately see why Civic Center Mall is consistently ranked as one of the top places in the Valley to take pictures and you're quite likely to see a professional photographer there taking photos for a wedding party or a quinceanera. Civic Center Mall is also the site for lots of festivals so you might end up getting food at the Scottsdale Culinary Festival or shopping at the Scottsdale Arts Festival. If you want to check out more art, wander into the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art (SMOCA) or see a show at the Scottsdale Performing Arts Center. Finally, grab a bite to eat or a drink at AZ88 or Distrito, both of which border the mall. All in all, you can't go wrong at the Civic Center Mall!

Yum, yum, yum!!!  Tasty chicken fingers, fries and Texas Toast along with delicious dipping sauce.  Fast and friendly service. My whole family likes going to Cane's, so what more can I say.  If you want something different than the normal burgers and fries, Raising Cane's is a great choice.  Enjoy!

When you have children playing youth sports, the kids are constantly outgrowing their stuff and the equipment can get expensive. That where C & S Sporting Goods comes in handy. This Central Phoenix store sells a mix of new and used sporting goods and you can trade in your old stuff for credit.  Whether you're looking for baseball, lacrosse, golf, tennis, or soccer gear, they have a great selection of equipment for fitness, team sports, bicycling, etc.  Plus even if you don't have equipment to trade in, the prices on new and used stuff are great and the service is excellent.  They may not have everything you are looking for, but C&S is definitely a place to look.

Another great addition to the North Central area!   Filling the spot at 16th and Bethany Home once occupied by a Basha's Supermarket, Flip Dunk is a trampoline and gymnastics gym owned by Bob Woolf, best known for his work as the Phoenix Suns Gorilla.  The bouncing area includes a trampoline basketball court; along with a single rim for basketball dunking; a bungee cord section; trampoline dodge ball area; and a large open jump area with trampolines making up the floor and even the walls, so you can literally "bounce off the walls"!  The front of the house has equipment for gymnastics and even a trampoline run for doing back flips and other acrobatics.  There's seating in front for non-participants and even a balcony in back for onlookers. The gym even offers free wi-fi!  Prices are reasonable - $8 to $10 hour for open jump and gymnastics courses run around $250 for a three month class that meets once a week.  And what's even more fun, it's not age restricted. While it was certainly overrun with children on this day before Thanksgiving, even adults can go and jump if they want.  The only improvement I can suggest would be to have separate areas for the little kids and the bigger ones during open jump. A five-year-old can get taken out very easily by a 12-year-old when both are propelled by springs.  However, overall this is a five-star addition to this part of Phoenix and hopefully will stay around for many years to come.

Over the past few years GCU has spared no expense in its effort to almost completely overhaul the entire campus and the new arena is one of the nicest new additions. Having watched a volleyball tournament once in GCU's old gym, I was extremely impressed when I recently attended a college basketball game here. This is a great arena to see a sporting event or a concert. It's small enough that every seat has great views and there are even luxury boxes for those who want that sort of thing.  My only complaint, and the reason for the loss of one star, is that the public address system was hard to understand and considering all the money they put into the building, I was surprised by this.  In general though, I was extremely impressed by this new addition to the Valley scene. It's another great facility for events.

Yummy chicken fingers, great sauce and friendly service!  I really like this chain that has only recently entered the Valley. The restaurants are nice and clean, decorated in fun style with movie posters and other pop culture memorabilia on the wall. Each restaurant also seems to support its local high school sports teams and many of the workers likely come from those schools.  Service has been very friendly, you order and they bring the food to your table. Going through the drive-through is very quick as well.  As for the food, they keep the menu simple: chicken fingers, fries, and Texas toast. The breading on the chicken fingers is tasty and I really love the special dipping sauce they provide - not sure how to describe the flavor except that its really good.  Overall, Raising Cane's is a great addition to the Valley's fast food scene.

When my office asked where I wanted to go for my birthday lunch I didn't hesitate at all before saying Barrio Queen.  As someone who's loved the original Barrio Cafe for the decade or so its been open, Barrio Queen is a worthy addition to the lineup. For those who are used to the original, Barrio Queen is just as tasty, but has a little more room and better parking.  Whether you go for the three tacos for $10, the Cochinitas Pibil torta sandwich, an enchilada, quesadilla or anything else on the menu, you will likely be happy.  Because it was my birthday, we also decided to try the desserts. I thought the chocolate cake was delicious and my coworkers liked the churros.  I haven't been there at night, but I hear the margaritas and other drinks are tasty as well.  My only complaint is that they seemed a little understaffed at lunch. One waitress seemed to be handling the whole place and as nice as she was, she was a little overwhelmed so at times we had to try and flag her down for service.  All in all though, Barrio Queen is one of my favorite restaurants in Downtown Scottsdale.

What looks like a nondescript dive bar from the outside turns out to be one of the coolest little places you can find. The whole place is very dark with the front room containing some seating at couches and tables along with the bar. Just with this I liked the place, but the other room is even better. That's where they have old school bar games like darts, skee-ball, and pinball. If you can't have a good time here you're not trying! Service was great and they had an excellent selection of liquor and beer.

This is a good place for a quick, healthy lunch. The sandwiches and salads are tasty and the coffee and desserts are good as well. Just keep in mind, it gets pretty crowded at lunch so parking may be crowded and there's almost always a line, but they do a good job of getting to you quickly. While its not a place for a long, quiet conversation, it does its job.

After running my first two half marathons in November and December, I thought I was done for a while, but a week before the Rock N Roll I was offered a free entry and I thought, why not?  Yes, it's busy, yes, there are tons of people, and I absolutely loved it! One of the things I dislike about running is doing it by myself, and in this race I was absolutely never alone. There were people running all around me, bands playing, people cheering, even high school cheerleading teams out rooting us on.  The organization was great as well. The expo the day before was super smooth to get your number and t-shirt and there were all sorts of great vendors on display, Fox 10 was one of the sponsors and I even got to catch up briefly with John Hook who I had worked with more than 20 years ago at the NBC station in Tucson.  The morning of the race was very easy. I took a light rail train filled with runners across town to the ASU campus and followed everyone to the start line. There are UPS trucks there where you can leave your gear bag and then you head for your starting corral. It was a little chilly so some people brought throwaway clothes to wear until they warmed up, but with my t-shirt, running sleeves, and running tights I was fine.  The course itself is extremely scenic. You start on the ASU campus, head up Hayden to McDowell, take a quick jaunt through SkySong, up Scottsdale Road to Thomas, over to 56th Street, back South to McDowell, up and down the hill at McDowell which gives you an amazing view of the Phoenix skyline, through Papago Park, down Van Buren, across the Mill Avenue bridge, turn right on Rio Salado Parkway and you're at the finish line before you know it. Some elevation but not too much, and tons of great places to take photos.  At the end, you get your medal, and are given lots of food and drinks to replenish yourself. I polished off a Powerbar, banana, Chocolate Milk, and a water before I even got out of the finish area and found my family.  The festival afterward is great as well. I got my free Michelob Ultra and the kids got something to drink. We listened to a bit of the headliner, Better Than Ezra, before we had to head out to my 9-year-old's soccer tournament.  Overall, this was an A+ experience and I am definitely thinking of running it again!

This place was started by the former CEO of Hooters which is not at all surprising. I guess he figured that scantily clad servers with enhanced boobs is a concept that can't fail as long as there are men in this world. And maybe he'd be right, if it was located in an area that didn't have so many other places that offer equally attractive servers, better atmosphere, and better food.   Unfortunately, it just feels like Twin Peaks is trying too hard. While the waitresses are attractive, I didn't see any real effort being made by them to interact with the clients. The food, while better than Hooters, is nothing special, and my order of fish tacos came out of the kitchen far too fast to have been made from scratch which leads me to believe that the food is prepared elsewhere and likely just warmed up or microwaved at the restaurant.   Finally, the atmosphere is supposed to be like a hunting / fishing lodge, but with such a giant building, it really felt more like a warehouse with some outdoors memorabilia stuck to the wall.   Maybe I'm wrong and the chain will be a huge success, but I just wasn't impressed. With all the competition in the market, Twin Peaks really doesn't differentiate itself in any meaningful way.

I joke that to be a yogi today in Arizona you need three things: a Spiritual Gangster shirt, smoothies from Kaleidoscope Juice, and a mala from Silver and Sage.  But all joking aside, I really like this place. I stopped in to check out mala bracelets for my wife and was very impressed with the store and the service. Mary took the time explain all of the different types of malas and the properties of the various rocks to me.  I ended up picking out a bracelet that I thought my wife would like and she did. I also like the fact that if the bracelet doesn't fit properly you can take it by and they will adjust it for you.  So if you're looking for unique jewelry that also has an interesting story, check out Silver and Sage.

I really wanted to like this place, but unfortunately it doesn't live up to expectations. With a name like Oink you'd think they would get really creative but other than offering several eight types of bacon and maple glazed bacon donuts, they don't really seem to do all that much with it.   We ordered the bacon flight to sample all of the different types and then our individual meals. I had the 50/50 burger which is described as 1/2 ground bacon and 1/2 ground beef. It was good, but the bacon flavor wasn't nearly as tasty as I expected. My wife had two eggs and bacon which also came with hashbrowns. She noted that the hashbrowns were boring and the eggs and bacon weren't any better than other breakfast places. My kids ate pancakes and pigs in a blanket off of the kid's menu which didn't seem to include any specialty bacon offerings.  As stated, for a place that claims to specialize in pork products, there really didn't seem to be many. For a start, how about pork belly, bacon-flavored hot chocolate, or even just the ability to order a plate of a specific type of bacon. Yes, the bacon flight is nice but the presentation was lacking, basically just 8 strips on a plate. I'm sure a creative chef could come up with even more ideas.Right now Oink has a good name but they definitely need to work on the execution.

With all the camping I'm doing now that both my boys are active in Boy Scouts I decided I needed a warmer fleece jacket, so on our way home from Sedona this past weekend I decided to stop and check out this store.  I was very happy to find that unlike some brands (cough cough...Ralph Lauren, Brooks Brothers, Coach) Columbia doesn't make cheaper merchandise just to sell in its outlets. In fact, these are the same items that you would pay a lot more for at stores like REI or Sports Authority. Now I don't know if they have all of the styles or all of the colors available elsewhere but since I found the basic fleece jacket I wanted for only $22 I was happy.  There's apparently one other Columbia outlet in the state at the Outlets at Wild Horse Pass, so even though they are practically on opposite ends of the metro area, the savings make it worth the drive.

So this is basically a standard gas station and mini mart with one notable exception... It also includes a full service post office where you can buy stamps, send letters, ship packages, etc. and all without having to wait in line at a regular post office and deal with the bad attitudes of US Postal Service workers.  If you need to ship packages, this is the place to go and for that reason alone, this place gets my recommendation.

Great patio, great food, and great selection of drinks!  The brats, the fries were delicious. I also loved the selection of sauces and mustards which are apparently all made right in house.  And they have a great selection of bottled soft drinks if you're at lunch or don't feel like drinking. Really want something good, try to the fresh squeezed lemonade... it's tart, but delicious!  Brat Haus, you're a great addition to the Valley food scene!

A great new addition to Old Town Scottsdale! As one of my coworkers said, this is the type of the place she would go when she is on vacation. Luckily, we live and work in a resort community, so we can go here all the time.  Morning Squeeze specializes in breakfast and lunch. It is brightly decorated with colorful booths inside, a square bar that can be accessed from the inside or from the dog friendly patio. The wait staff are very friendly and are willing to answer all of your questions about the menu, but be nice, they deal with enough jerks who are either hungover or still drunk from the night before in Scottsdale.  I've tried both breakfast and lunch items so far and found everything to be delicious although my coworker noted that her crab cakes could be a little crisper. My favorite so far are the Eggs Benedict.  Morning Squeeze also prides itself on a large selection of Bloody Mary's for those who want a kick start to the day.  If you like to eat out for breakfast this is definitely a place to add to the regular rotation.

This must be what nerd heaven is like.  If you're a fan of comic books, science fiction films, anime, or role playing games, this is a place for you.  Like many traditional antique malls, this large space is broken up into several smaller spaces operated by different vendors. There are many comic books, lots of action figures, toys, collectibles and other items to browse.  There's even a first-run comic book store in the back and a store that appears to specialize only in Transformers and GI Joes.  So, if you or someone you know, is into Star Trek, Star Wars, Batman, Superman, The Avengers, or a bunch of Japanese Anime that I don't recognize, this is a great place to go.  In fact, it's such nerd heaven that I half expected to see Sheldon and the rest of the guys from The Big Bang Theory checking through the merchandise.

Lots of great clothing for people on a budget and all of the proceeds support a great organization.  They have a better selection and nicer stuff than Goodwill or other thrift shop and while the prices may not be quite as cheap, all of the proceeds support the Fresh Start Women's Foundation which helps women going through divorce, changing jobs, or going through other life changes.   If you're looking for quality items, including many top-end and designer goods, than this is a place to check. And if you're cleaning out your closet and looking for a place to donate your stuff, this is a good place to go as well.

With two boys involved in scouting, we do a lot of camping and outdoor activities and it can get expensive. That's why its great to find a place that specializes in used outdoor equipment. Like any consignment store, selection varies depending on when you visit but if you're looking for something specific you can call and ask and they will let you know if they have it.  The owner is very cool and easy to deal with. He's happy to point you in the right direction and is very upfront about what he does and doesn't have in stock.  We've picked up a first aid kit there before, but unfortunately on our most recent visit they didn't have a lightweight sleeping bag that worked for me. Despite that, Salvation Outdoor is now one of my regular stops when I'm looking for outdoor gear.

Other than the fact that it gets so loud that its hard to have a conversation, I really like this place. The pizza is delicious, service was good, and the atmosphere is fun. Who would ever thought to put brussel sprouts on a pizza? Definitely a place to hit up in the Central Corridor.

Finally had a chance to give this place a try now that they are open for lunch. Great setting, friendly people, and good food. I had the Cubano sandwich with fries and a sweet pickle and it was excellent. Since I had to go back to work, I stuck with a Coke, and they have the Mexican Cokes in the glass bottle. However, I noticed that they have an excellent selection of craft beers, including two of my favorites, Ninkasi and Dogfish Head, along with a large selection of wine and other cocktails. I also saw a couple be seated on the patio with their dog and the bartender took an actual water bowl out for the pup, which seems like a great idea. I am definitely a fan, and will no doubt be back again... hopefully when I'm not working so I can have a good beer with my meal!

While I'm sure it can get overly busy and obnoxious, that's the drawback of creating a place with so much fun stuff. However, at 11:30 a.m. on a Saturday it's the perfect place for my 7-year-old, his soccer team, and numerous siblings to run around and play games like cornhole (beanbag toss), ping-pong, and foosball while the parents get to have conversation and enjoy a few adult beverages.  Service was quick and the food was quite good - I had the grilled chicken club and my boys had the mac and cheese.  In sum, this is a great place for everyone, families, couples, singles, etc. Now I really want to ride my bike over, have a few drinks, watch a few games. Honestly, this would be a great place to just camp out during the first few days of the NCAA Basketball Tournament.

As others have said, it's probably the closest thing to Bay Area shopping in the Valley. That being said, its not really like the Ferry Building or the Fourth Street shops in Berkeley, but it is a good collection of local businesses with interesting items that you're unlikely to find elsewhere. From olive oil to bicycles, travel accessories to vintage sunglasses, men's and women's clothing or even classic candies, this is place to go if you want something different and unique.  I just wonder how long it will last because rent in the Biltmore can't be cheap and even with the inflated prices, these stores are going to need to do a lot of business and so far when I've been they appear to be filled with people browsing, not buying.

A spa designed for men? Well, guys work and play outside and our skin takes a beating from the elements and the stress of daily life, which is why Stacey Grondahl has created a environment where men can go to relax and get rejuvenated. Treatments include facials, massages, skin peels, and waxing.   Stacey is one of those rare women who love and understand men and you'll enjoy both your conversation and the music which includes favorites like Sinatra, Johnny Cash, and Elvis. In fact the entire spa is designed to make men comfortable and its a place where you'll not only feel comfortable getting a treatment, but you may want to just hang out and shoot the breeze.  As for the services, they are amazing and when you walk out you'll look better, feel more relaxed, and be ready to go back to being one of the Masters of the Universe. In fact, the only worry you'll have will be finding an open date on your calendar for your next visit.

Zoolights has gotten better year over year. If you haven't been in a while, you should check it out again. It's a great holiday tradition in the Valley and a great place to take kids. No, you won't see any animals... they're sleeping... but you will see some great light displays and maybe you can go back to the Zoo during daylight hours to see the animals. So bundle up and go out to Zoolights!

After the Scottsdale location decided that smoothies sold better than bagels I feared that this place would switch over as well. Luckily bagels must do well in North Central Phoenix, so it has remained open. The bagels here are made in the traditional manner of being boiled and this allows them to have the correct taste of having a light crust with chewy interior. They are far better than anything you can find at Einstein's or the grocery store. For my money, Everything Bagels and Chompie's make the only decent bagel in Phoenix, but the nearest Chompie's is all the way at PV Mall.  Also, Everything Bagels has my favorite salt bagels plus a large selection of other types.   If you're in the mood for a bagel, this is the place to go!

Whether you're going to watch golf, people watch, network for business purposes, party at the Bird's Nest, or just be part of the scene, the Waste Management Phoenix Open is the place to be in Arizona during Super Bowl week.  The Phoenix Open attracts everyone and everyone has a great time when they go. Sure, there are a lot of people and you have to wait in a few lines to get tickets, food and drink, or even just to catch a bus back to the parking lot at the end of the day, but everyone is in a good mood and its a lot of fun!  Despite the crowds, you can still find holes where you can get right up by the tee box or the green and really get a chance to see some great golf. If you just go for the social scene, the food and beverage area is great and of course, the world famous 16th Hole is the place to be. The Bird's Nest brings in world-class entertainment every year and is definitely the place for the single and young at heart.  So if you're looking for something to do during Super Bowl week in the Valley of the Sun, head on out to the Waste Management Phoenix Open. Even those who find golf to be boring will have a good time.  Oh, and if you're going to drink, get a designated driver. Scottsdale P.D. are out in force and getting a DUI isn't a good way to end a great day.

Really impressed with this place. They have men's and women's clothing, shoes, and accessories. Some is consignment, some is last season's wares from local designers, but its all really nice and offered at a good price. Plus, I like the fact that part of the proceeds go to support women in need.  The owner, Helen, was extremely nice and took her time to show me around and to show me various items. This despite the fact that I walked in right as the place was closing and she could have easily told me to come back another time.  I will definitely be adding Fashion Xchange to my shopping rotation. Another great way to find designer clothing and accessories in the Valley without breaking the bank!

Great little neighborhood hangout in North Central Phoenix. The food is good, the service is friendly - although not always that fast - and the selection of beer, wine, and cocktails will keep you going. They have a nice large patio for when the weather is nice and plenty of room inside. The parking lot seems a little wonky, but considering its called Spoke & Wheel, you are really encouraged to ride your bike. All in all, this is a nice little place in the center of town.

I'm a fan of authentic street tacos and this is a great place to get them. They grill the meat right in front of you, so the whole place smells great when you walk up. The tacos are tasty and I can easily eat 4 or 5 for lunch. It's truly just a hole in the wall, and there is no place to sit, so be prepared to find a spot on the sidewalk or take your food somewhere else.  Oh, and don't get the red sauce on your fingers and then rub your eye or you'll be looking for an eyewash station pretty fast, LOL.  P.S. I'll bet these tacos taste even better after a night out at the clubs in the area!

I always love finding a good place to get a haircut and Shaving Grace is as good as it gets. Opened for only about six months and located very close to my office, Shaving Grace has the feel of an old school barbershop with the modern day class and style of today.   Boris took care of my hair and made it look great, he's also a good guy to talk with. The haircut, the conversation, the hot towel, and the shoulder rub at the end were all excellent and I walked out both looking and feeling great.  Shaving Grace is a great new addition to modern barbershops in the Valley and one to which I will definitely be returning.  Highly recommended!

Decent sandwiches, but what I really like is the fact that they are tied in with Everything Bagel's.   However, why is Everything Bagel's always out of salt bagels? Seriously., I stop there at 7:55 in the morning and they're already out of salt bagels? A couple of times they said they didn't even make them that day.  One request, if you say you make Salt bagels and you have a bin marked Salt Bagels, MAKE SOME DAMN SALT BAGELS!!!

OK - I'm jumping them up to four stars because I stopped in this morning and not only did they have salt bagels, the guy told me that he had hired a new baker and that means he won't have to be there seven days a week anymore. I'm hoping that this means that they will have salt bagels everyday from now on.  Also, the new baker did a great job and my salt bagels tasted great!!!

This is the closest Hi-Health to my office and luckily, one of the best ones I have found. Mostly this is because Rebecca, the manager, was a nationally ranked fitness competitor and bodybuilder for 18 years who knows her stuff extremely well. Unlike some locations where you can tell that the employees only know what the company tells them to say, you can get some expert advice here.

When you get tired of DJ's and electronic music and you're ready for some authentic music made by actual musicians, this is the place for you.  The minute you walk in you realize that this isn't some honky tonk dive, this is a very dark, classy place, with a large bar and plenty of seating. The stage is well appointed and there's even an area next to the stage that looks to be a VIP lounge.  This is the type of place that you would normally find in NYC, LA or Nashville, so its a great addition to Scottsdale. It reminds me of the type of place where you might have found Johnny Cash, Frank Sinatra, or George Jones taking the stage back in the day. In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if this becomes the place where national musicians go to play a few unannounced sets when they are in town.  Gotta say, in just one visit The Western has become my favorite new place in town.

Dierks Bentley's Whiskey Row is the latest and newest place to open in Old Town Scottsdale. It's basically a sports bar / nightclub with a country music theme.   Like most entertainment establishments in Scottsdale the servers are exclusively very attractive females and at Whiskey Row they are attired in outfits that you would normally see at Country Thunder - tight t-shirts, cutoff jeans shorts, and cowboy boots. Guys will enjoy the view.  While the theme is good old country music, the food and beverages are anything but old fashioned. The menu includes burgers, salads, shrimp, flat iron steak, grilled cheese, and chicken breasts.   As for the drinks, Whiskey Row has installed the latest system where each table, and even the foosball table, has a set of taps serving alcohol and beer so you can refill your drinks at your convenience. Just order what you want from the computer screen at each table, use your credit card to pay for it and drink away. I doubt it unlimited though, other places that use this system limit you to a specific number of refills before the servers have to reauthorize you to get more, so you can't just sit there and get hammered.  Also, because the drinks are served in this manner they are charged by the ounce rather than by the glass.   And, if you really want to do shots of whiskey the fun way, there is a dentist-type chair by the entrance that tilts back and allows you to have whiskey poured straight down your gullet. I have a feeling that's going to be quite popular with the Scottsdale clientele.  Whiskey Row features a combination of live music and a DJ, but it will all be country. The band will perform on a stage that is suspended above the bar and there is a small dance floor next to the bar as well.   They are also showing the UFC fights and at least for the most recent one, they did not charge a cover which is a good deal if you like that sport.  I predict that this is going to be a very popular new addition to the Scottsdale nightlife lineup

It's about that time the Valley had more than one place that makes good bagels.  Everything Bagels makes bagels they way they should be made, boiled and baked, not grilled. That makes them come out with a great tasting exterior and a chewy inside that tastes like a good bagel should taste. If you've never had a good bagel prepare to be amazed because these are not the lousy ones you find at the grocery store or Einstein's.  So if you're a fan of good bagels and Chompies is out of the way, you should know that you have another option now in Everything Bagels.  Check it out!

This is a hidden gem in the heart of Scottsdale. First of all, the entire street of Cattletrack is a throwback to the time before developers started squeezing 4-5 houses on every available acre. The studio is one of several businesses located on an old house property including Silver and Sage Jewelry, a feng shui consultant, and a cabinet maker.  As to the studio itself, it is tiny. I'm not sure how many people can take a class at the same time, but probably no more than a dozen and maybe not even that many. It's also donation based with a suggested payment of $10 cash and $12 credit. (Edit - as of Feb 1 rates are going up to $18 cash and $20 credit) That's nice because you're not locked into a monthly rate.  The atmosphere is caring and open and the teachers seem great as well. I took a restorative yoga class with Jenny Love and, pun not intended, loved it. Unfortunately I haven't had the opportunity to take a class with the owner, Rebecca Lammersen, but I follow her on Twitter and read her articles on Elephant Journal and am always impressed with her mindset.  So, if you're looking for a great place to practice in Scottsdale, check out Yogalution!

This is a surprisingly good country bar on the West side of town. Live band, large dance floor, cold drinks, and a big outdoor patio for the smokers. The crowd was very down to earth and very friendly. It seemed like people were just there to have a good time and hang out, no worries about showing off or trying to impress others, This is definitely a fun place if you want to go out dancing and have a good time!

People who haven't been there probably don't realize that Detroit has its own type of hot dogs known as Coney's. It's basically a chili dog served with or without onions and covered in a specific type of chili that tends to be a little less meaty and a little more watery than you get in places like Texas. Other Michigan specific items include Better Made Potato Chips and it wouldn't be a fair representation of the Wolverine state if you couldn't wash it all down with a Vernor's Ginger Ale or a Faygo pop. While it seems like the Chicago foods tend to get all the love in the Valley, Detroit Coney is a nice change for anyone who's ever spent time in the Motor City.

How did I completely miss the fact that there's now a Lululemon in Scottsdale Fashion Square. Yes, the stuff is pricey, but the selection is great and the service is unparalleled.  Plus, this store now offers free poolside yoga on Wednesday's at 6:00 pm at the Valley Ho. I'm definitely going to check it out.  Namaste!

I wanted to update this review because a number of people have asked me why I am such a fan of Lululemon. Well, yes, the clothes do tend to make women look amazing, but my reason is more personal.   You see, I'm 6'3", 200 lbs, and when I first started doing yoga I had a cheap, regular sized mat which meant that during class I had to readjust my place on the mat between every position and I couldn't get into any sort of flow. So, I talked to some people who had more yoga experience and they recommended that I try the Big Mat from Lululemon. The Big Mat is wider and longer than a regular mat and it has allowed me to actually enjoy yoga and get better at my practice.  The other problem I've always found is that gym clothes aren't often made for tall people.  In fact, one of my biggest pet peeves throughout the years has been the fact that most workout pants are too short. Luckily Lululemon is a Canadian company, so its men's clothing is designed for physically fit hockey players, many of whom are tall. (In fact some pants even say that they will work for hockey butt, i.e. the large glutes gained from constant skating). Lululemon pants come in 32-36" inseams. They fit and they continue to fit even after being washed. They are also ncredibly comfortable... in fact now I know why women are so fond of wearing yoga pants everywhere!  Plus, I'm really impressed with the company's commitment to the community. Every store sponsors free weekly yoga classes. In the Phoenix area you can go on Wednesday nights to the Scottsdale Valley Ho, and on Sunday's to the Biltmore Fashion Park or Scottsdale Quarter. Plus all three stores recently came together to sponsor the first every Mistletoe Flow which was a fun run along the canal followed by a yoga class at the Scottsdale Valley Ho. And these classes aren't just some cheap, half-assed classes that they provide. Lululemon works with the best instructors in town and participants get a quality experience that doesn't cost a dime.  Lululemon, it's not just for women anymore!

Great place to stop in after my son's indoor soccer games on Saturday and Sunday morning. I've never seen this place crowded and they always have an excellent selection of donuts. If you're craving donuts, Krispy Kreme is the way to go!

I was here for a Yoga event in the parking lot and I don't actually drink coffee, but I like the fact that they have a good selection of craft beer and the atmosphere inside was very appealing. Lots of seating, space to set up your lap top and work, and live music from a guitar playing singer. All in all, this is the type of place where I could see myself hanging out.

This tiny little bar is located on Bethany Home at 16th Street right around the corner from TexAz Grill and its a great addition to the neighborhood. The Whining Pig specializes in wine and craft beer and while its a tiny place, it has a great selection of beverages, homemade desserts, friendly staff, and a great selection of trivia and board games. Apparently they do a trivia challenge one night a week, where one side of the bar competes against the other.  If you're looking for a nice friendly casual place to get a drink and have some fun, check out The Whining Pig.

I love this studio and its people! The owner, Ashley, has created an inviting location that is well laid out and she and the other teachers are great at making you feel welcomed and appreciated.   The yoga room is nice and big, with doors on two sides that the instructors are willing to open when the heat gets too much. Sure its hot yoga, but they are very careful to make sure that no one gets overwhelmed. Being Sumit's, its the same routine everytime, but I can see how if you did it on a regular basis you would quickly see results and you could get comfortable enough with the routine that your practice would expand beyond just the physical and more into the mental aspects of yoga.  The changing rooms, at least the men's one, is nice and big with plenty of room for your stuff and even a couple of showers if you need to clean up after class.  The area when you walk in has lots of room and a nice selection of stuff to buy including shirts, pants, and clothing from Yoganastixx and other brands, bracelets from Silver and Sage, and mats, towels, and other yoga related items. There's also plenty of room for incoming students to sit while another class finishes up.  All of the instructors that I've met are super friendly, from Ashley, to Michelle, Marissa, and Matt. If it wasn't too located so far from my house and my work, I would definitely make this a regular place to practice. As it stands, I'm just going to try and visit whenever I can.

Finally had a chance to try their newest location and as the four stars say, Yay, I'm a fan!  I've always liked pastys and have eaten them in places as diverse as Northern Michigan, Canada, England, and Northern California. That's why I'm excited that this local restaurant is thriving here in Arizona.  The Scottsdale location is nice and big and although I was here for lunch I would love to go back in the evening and try a few of the beers on the menu. The patio is very comfortable with misters to keep it cool and the interior looks great with lots of seating for both large and small groups.  Cornish Pasty Co. is definitely a great new addition to the oldtown Scottsdale area.

Did you overdo it at the clubs or bar last night, take an Uber home, and are regretting it the next day? Well it's time to recover like the celebrities do, and that's by kicking back in a massage chair and getting an IV drip full of vitamins, minerals, and painkillers. In about 30 minutes, you'll start feeling human again and you'll be able to start planning your next night of debauchery... perhaps even that very same evening. And it's not just for hangovers, feeling a little down, low on energy, stressed out, or just want to avoid getting sick? Well they have drips to address all of those issues. Or, if you just want a little extra energy, stop in for a B12 shot. They even offer botox for those who want to appear completely expressionless (or younger, I can't always tell the difference). And you can feel confident in knowing that all of the medical procedures are administered by trained nurses who take the time to listen to your concerns, explain the process, and walk you through any issues or discomfort you might experience. My only regret is that this place wasn't around back when I was single and went out a lot more!

Whether you're looking for ASU or Cactus League gear, this is the place to go. Owned by an ASU alumni and located right on Mill, Cactus Sports has the best selection of clothing and other Sun Devil gear on the strip. Prices are basically MSRP, but they always have lots of items on sale.  If you're a Sun Devil fan I definitely recommend Cactus Sports!

I haven't had a chance to attend many Yelp events this past year, so when I saw that this one was on my way home from work I decided to stop by.  What a great event! I had the opportunity to see some Yelp friends, meet some others in person for the first time, and to support a local business where I picked up a Christmas present for my kids.  I also recalled how much I liked this place when I used to come here nearly a decade ago... and I remembered what I don't like about LGO... the parking... or lack thereof.  However, I am happy to see Yelp supporting local businesses and hope that these efforts continue even when its not the holiday season.

For a cheap car wash they do an excellent job. They will actually take the time to use the scrub brush on your car and hose off the dirt before you go into the automated bay. They also space cars enough so that you don't feel as if you are going to run into the car in front of you or hit by the one behind you. If you're in Scottsdale and want your car to look good quickly, this is a great place to go.

We stopped in here the other evening before going to the theatre and had an excellent meal. Yes, they've hit all the current trends, farm-to-fork, craft beer, wine, even a bicycle on the wall, but they've put it together in a really nice way.  The food was excellent, I had the pork chop, my wife had the scallops, and I tried a local craft beer. Service was great and fast, especially when I told them we had theater tickets so we couldn't dawdle, and the setting was excellent.  This is definitely a place that I would recommend and one to which I will return.

I had previously visited the original Paul Martin's in Roseville, California so I was pleased to find that this location is just as good. Everything is prepared on site and the menu changes seasonally. Everything is excellent and prices are reasonable. Service was very attentive and if we had been there in the evening I could see that they had an excellent selection of wine and other beverages. Paul Martin's is an excellent place for a nice meal or to celebrate a special occasion. And although we sat inside, I noticed that they have a very nice patio that would be great to try.

I discovered shabu when I worked in Sacramento where there are several restaurants serving this style of food, but until now you haven't been able to get it in Phoenix which I why I was thrilled to hear that this location had opened... and close to my house to boot.  For those who've never had it, shabu is an asian style of fondue, sometimes referred to as hot pot. Instead of oil, cheese, or chocolate each table has its own warmer to which they bring you a large bowl of soup broth in which you cook your food. You can even order two types of broth that come in a large container that is split down the middle.  We ordered two, the base, house broth for the kids and a slightly spicier lemongrass broth for us. We then ordered a mix of items to cook including beef, chicken, tofu, broccoli, dumplings, crab, scallops, and noodles. When they bring the items, they tell you how long each one should cook and its helpful to arrange them by cooking time starting with the longest that take 3 to 4 minutes and working down to those that take only a minute or less.  Once you have all of your food, the fun begins. My kids had a blast deciding what to try, cooking their own food, and eating with chopsticks.  Service was excellent, our server stopped by several times to see how we were doing and to adjust the heat on our hot plate. The manager (owner?) stopped by a few times as well to make sure we were having a good time and we assured him that we definitely were.  The atmosphere was fun as well. It's decorated sort of like a club and they were playing a great mix of tunes, including stuff that we used to go out dancing to in the 80s and 90s... definitely a Bright Lights, Big City type of place. The manager even mentioned that they have a DJ in the Thai restaurant next door on Friday and Saturday nights.  While we had a great time as a family, this would also be a blast for an adult night out on the town. If you've never had shabu, or you've been missing it in Phoenix, you definitely want to head on out to Shabu Fondue for an enjoyable time!

Love, love, love the fact that we again have a good, independent, bookstore in Central Phoenix and especially that they opened in the old Beefeater's location! To give a little history, my wife and I held our rehearsal dinner at Beefeater's so I was very sad when it closed, but now to have a bookstore, restaurant, bar, coffee shop, and even a gardening shop in that space makes me happy.  Changing Hands is nothing like the giant mega-bookstores you may be used to, but rather it takes you back to the independent bookstores of olden days where the workers and owners actually select the books that they sell, and have even read many of them. Whatever topic you're looking for, you'll likely find a selection of well written books in that area.  And, they have a bar!!! Yes, a bookstore where you can not only enhance your mind, but do so while drinking a craft beer or glass of wine. What could be better than that.  So if you're looking for something to do or want a place to go, check out Changing Hands... now in Central Phoenix!

Super fun place! It's a driving range, bar, restaurant, and night club all in one. I came here initially with a group of my coworkers to celebrate the end of the fiscal year and even though most of them are not golfers we had a good time. I then brought my family back and we had fun hitting balls off of the upper deck. Yes, its a little nerve wracking when your 12-year-old decides to look over the edge but everyone had a great time and my wife and kids really enjoyed it as well. You don't even need to bring your own clubs, although if you're competitive you'll probably want to do so. Also, the food and drinks are good and no more expensive than any other night spot in Scottsdale.

This is the new hot spot in Scottsdale and not only does it look good, but the food is excellent. Now combining Latin America cuisine with Asian food may sound a little odd at first, but trust me, this place is great!  We went here the other day for our office Christmas lunch and had a great time. There were six of us and between us we tried the following items: guacamole with pomegranate, street tacos, Chinese-style chili crab garlic noodles, Mexican pho, Mexican street corn, the steak pepito sandwich, and the lobster and crab "dynamite".   Everyone enjoyed their food immensely and the service was great, with the waiter answering all our questions and doing an excellent job of adjusting the heaters and the wind shades so that everyone was comfortable. For dessert, we decided to split three items, the tres leche cake, chocolate peanut butter bar, and the chocolate sticky cake.  My only regret is that there were so many other items on the menu that I wanted to try and no one else wanted to order the ceviche, but I guess that just means I have an excuse to go back... and I definitely plan to do that. In fact, I may need to make several visits to get my fill of this place :-)

OK, first of all they don't have you run on a treadmill or try and sell you overpriced molded footbeds for your brand new shoes, but that's because this store is staffed by actual runners who can look at your walk and tell whether you pronate, supinate, or have a neutral gait. In fact they even noticed how tight my calves were and not only helped me roll them out, but also gave some suggestions for future techniques I could use to help keep them looser.  Linda has put together a great store and brought on a great staff, some of whom worked for her before, in order to provide great customer service and to build a real sense of family for both employees and customers.   Throughout the week they sponsor group runs and training groups including pub run and a trail run on Sunday mornings. Check the website for details, but know that no matter which one you attend you will meet a group of dedicated and fun people who like to run and also like to have a good time.  Oh, and if you're a hockey fan feel free to talk to Linda. She's such a fan (and a player) its almost surprising the store doesn't also carry skates!  All in all, Fleet Feet is an excellent addition to the line up of specialty running stores in the Valley.

I met Maggie when she was teaching one of the free Lululemon yoga classes and when she mentioned that she was opening a new studio in Old Town, I was intrigued.  And now, having been there several times, I'm really glad that I was. Maggie has created an amazing space that is not only a yoga studio, but also a hair, makeup and spray tan salon... and hopefully soon, a natural-foods cafe. Of course, as a guy I have my barber, but everyone I talk to says Maggie is a great stylist.  As for me, I just know that she is a great yoga instructor. She teaches the basics in a clear, understandable manner, that helps beginners to learn and also works for those of us who have been practicing for a while. Even while continuing the class flow, Maggie takes the time to give one on one instruction and to teach new moves,  Plus she's not the only great instructor at Modify. Misty teaches both flow and restorative yoga classes that leave you feeling great and Alissa teaches a yoga nidra that took me deeper into meditation than I have been in years.  So if you're looking for a yoga studio and want to take your practice to a new level, check out Modify!

When I recently threw out my back again, my coworkers recommended Dr. Renee Haberl at Mountain View Chiropractic. While I've seen other chiropractors before, Dr. Haberl is the first to not only perform her own diagnosis, but also to send me for x-rays to determine the root issue of the problem. Turns out, I have some compression between the two lowest vertebrae in my spine that may be causing problems. Also, I'm pleased that unlike some previous chiropractors I've seen, Dr. Haberl doesn't seem interested in putting her patients on a long-term plan that seems more designed to ensure them a steady stream of income rather than fixing your body. Instead her goal seems to be getting you fixed up and better and then being available if you have future issues. After having seen her for just a few weeks, my back feels much better and I am glad to have her on my team as I train for my first half marathon.

For far too long the Popeye's nearest to North Central Phoenix was located at 67th Avenue and Peoria and unfortunately I've made that drive far too many times when craving some delicious spicy fried chicken and red beans and rice. That's why I was so excited when I saw that this former KFC location was converting to a Popeye's.  I stopped in the other night to pick up dinner for the family and had a great experience. First, because I know my kids don't want spicy, you can ask them to split the pieces between spicy and mild. Second, the cost of the family meal was actually $4 less than what it said on the menu. And finally, service was very prompt and fast.   It does still look as if the front parking lot is under construction so parking is a bit congested, but other than that this is a great new addition to the North Central / Sunnyslope area.

I really like the concept, but the execution needs some serious improvement.  First of all, the décor and style of this place are amazing. You definitely get that New England feel. The place looks amazing and I love the way they've redone the space.  The food is pretty good as well, I had a burger and homemade chips, and they were great.  But then, the service, or lack thereof, makes it all fall apart. I sat at the bar, and the bartender paid enough attention to me to take my order and bring me a drink. Beyond that his situational awareness was completely lacking. He didn't notice when I needed a refill and I had to flag another guy down when I was done and needed my bill. In fact, I was sitting on the patio side of the bar, and while I sat there, a young lady came in and sat down on the restaurant side. Unfortunately, the two bartenders were so engrossed in conversation with some people who appeared to be with one of the liquor distributors, that they completely ignored this young lady. Eventually, after five minutes or so, she got frustrated, gave me a knowing look, and left. The barstaff is probably still oblivious that they lost a customer.   Additionally, I noticed people at tables walking up to the bar and grabbing their own napkins and other items which tells me that they weren't getting service either.  The sad part is that I saw quite a few staff members, but they all seemed to be grouped toward the back of the restaurant where they were talking with each other rather than circulating throughout the restaurant and interacting with customers. In the experience I've had with restaurants and other organizations the lack of customer service usually comes from management and is copied by staff, so perhaps some new management is in order if The Montauk wishes to succeed. Personally, I hope they can turn it around. It's a great concept and one I would certainly support if it was well executed.

What's more fun than running? How about running with a great group of people, visiting awesome local businesses, and choosing your own route to go as far or as fast as you want in one hour. Not enough for you? How about the chance to meet representatives from local runs and other fitness related businesses before you head out for your run, and the chance to demo new equipment from brands like New Balance, Saucony, Brooks, Asics, Zensa, Yurbuds, and others. Still not enough? What if I told you that after you get done running for an hour all the raffle tickets you've picked up that night at each checkpoint give you the chance to win great prizes and that you can drink a beer or two while the prizes are drawn. Want more? After the initial drawings are done, there is an after party at one of the local restaurants with more beer and food and even more prize drawings! Oh, and in the hot summer months, one of the checkpoints Is always Big Surf Waterpark where runners strip off their shoes and socks, remove their electronics, and get to go down one of the big waterslides. Trust me, the 1.2 miles back to Roadrunner Sports feels great in 100+ degrees when you are soaking wet!! Got it, get it, good! OK, I'll see you at the Third Thursday Adventure Run!

The employees really don't seem interested in being there and when they do talk to you, they try and upsell you to a monthly membership. Stopped in today to get the mud off of my car after going off road and got a perfunctory swipe of my grill with the scrub brush and was shoved in so close behind the vehicle in front of me that I'm pretty sure I was picking up additional dirt from his vehicle. Sure, it gets a little more mud off your tires than driving through a lawn sprinkler,  but not much. If you really need a quick wash, it might be worth $5, but don't buy the more expensive washes as they don't give you any better service. Really not worth your time or money.

Remember how people used to say that you couldn't operate certain types of businesses without employing undocumented (illegal) workers? Well the old Danny's Car Wash certainly believed that, but its successor Jackson's is proving the lie of that statement. Not to be judgmental, but I have never seen so many white guys washing my car. Additionally, I'm pleased that Jackson's does not employ the same hard sell that I hated about Danny's. Yes, they still ask if I want a detail, but when I say no they don't push the issue and they don't try to guilt me into it. Clearly they are paying their employees a decent wage so they can do a good job and not have to be worried about commissions all the time. I've taken both of my cars here since they switched owners and I have been very happy with my wash both times. In fact last time the people at the end realized they had forgotten to vacuum the back section of my wife's minivan and the manager made sure that it got done before I left. If you're looking for a full service car wash, Jackson's is the place to go!

The Saguaro is an upscale, modern, hipster, cool, hotel and a great place to stay right in the center of the action in Old Town Scottsdale. However, to me it will always be the Doubletree Hotel where my family spent many weekends while visiting Scottsdale from Tucson.   And while I love the pool area that is so cool now with the cabanas, I can't be help but be reminded of how many times I played Marco Polo in that pool as a kid... and we didn't have to buy bottle service to get prime seats :-)  However, even if you don't already have great memories of this hotel, you can create them now by staying here next time you're in Scottsdale.  Check it out!

If you've spent time in Michigan and enjoyed the Coney Dogs at American or Lafayette Coney Island there, then you will enjoy this place. It's real Coney Dogs with chili like you get in Detroit, a side of Better Made potato chips, and then wash it all down with a Faygo (which is a pop, not a soda). As someone who was born in Ann Arbor, attended Hillsdale College, and then lived in the Detroit area for a few years, this was a great reminder of what I liked about Michigan... without all the snow. Just a tip, feel free to have a conversation about the Lions, Tigers, Pistons, Wolverines, or Spartans, but don't mention Ohio State or Notre Dame unless you want to take a lot of abuse!

There is a bar in a bookstore!!! Yes, I know plenty of bookstores have coffee shops, but I don't drink coffee, so that is not something that ever excited me. However, add a place where you can get some good craft beer or a glass of wine while reading a book you've found and you've got me hooked. And since it is located in a bookstore it's fairly quiet, not as quiet as a library, but not overly loud like most drinking establishments. In fact it's the perfect atmosphere to read, work on your tablet or laptop, or have a nice, normal speaking level conversation.   First Draft is definitely one of my first choices for a place to go in Central Phoenix.

Now when I want a good pizza for lunch I have a choice between Sauce and Fired Pie. Nice and fast, located in the food court at Scottsdale Fashion Square. The pizza is very tasty and the salads are good as well, If you're looking for a quick meal, this is a great option.

There are two great reasons to go to US Fries. One, they have excellent poutine, which for those who are unfamiliar is a Canadian dish from Quebec composed of french fries and cheese curds topped with gravy. Yes, it sounds gross at first but it is surprisingly good. Along with the traditional style, US Fries also has other styles of poutine including shepherd's pie and vegetarian. Two, they sell Eegee's! Again, for those not familiar, Eegee's is a type of icy fruit slushies from Tucson. Sure it's a weird combination: Quebec food, Tucson drinks, all served on Mill Avenue in Tempe, but hey, it works. I will definitely be back!

Really good hot dogs with interesting choices of toppings. I had the Sonoran Cousin with refried beans, onions, banana peppers, and bacon bites. My wife tried the Wunderhund with mustard relish and bacon bites, and my kids had a Columbian with pineapple, mozzarella cheese, Simon's sauce, and crushed potato chips while the other had the Cowboy with chili, Simon's sauce, and mozzarella cheese. Everyone thought their dog was delicious.  Service was fast and friendly and there is seating both inside and out.  If you like hot dogs, you should check it out!

It was pretty cool to see Star Wars The Force Awakens on its opening weekend at the newest and nicest theater in town. The theater is located at the Northeast end of Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall and you can enter from the mall or directly from the parking garage on the North side of the mall. The theater itself is very nice. The lobby includes seating areas, a bar with dessert selections, an outdoor patio, customer service, and a concession stand with standard movie fare like popcorn, sodas, and candies. What it is not is a movie theater with waiter service where they deliver food and drinks to your seat and that's fine with me, I've been to those places and while the waiters are usually fairly discreet, the other patrons trying to flag them down, pick up and put down their food, or sending back orders is what is generally very annoying. If you want dinner and movie that's fine, but do it somewhere else!  As for the theater experience itself, it was amazing! First of all, there is reserved seating so you can select where you want to sit and know it will be available. Secondly, the screens are curved for optimal viewing and the sound quality is amazing. Finally, the seats recline... and this isn't just leaning back, it's motorized loungers with footrests that come out and backs that go back so far you're almost lying down. In fact, the only drawback I can foresee is that because this theater will be showing art films, and the average age of the audience at those films is fairly old, it's quite possible that some people may find themselves falling asleep or sitting next to a snorer in this theater.   Overall though, this is an amazing place to see a movie and a worthy successor to the original Camelview. Once again we should be grateful that we have a chain like Harkins based in the Valley which provides us with great options for moviegoing.

Mary Coyle's is a Phoenix institution so it was sad when the 7th Avenue location closed a few years ago. Luckily, like any good Phoenix, they have risen from the ashes and been reborn at a new location on 7th Street!  All of your favorite ice cream concoctions are back and once again available in full or pippen size and while there's not as much seating as before, by the time you get done ordering a table will likely have opened up.  Plus, they're now located close to all of the happening places on 7th Street like The Yard, the Colony, and others, and they're open late. So if you're out having a good time, remember to leave room for ice cream!
