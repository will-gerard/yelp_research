The Pros: Food came out FAST LOTS of food, and cheap too!  The Cons: Everything that came out of the kitchen was premanufactured. Frozen fries, frozen wings, canned chili, canned cheese sauce. Wings were frozen and precooked so when they were cooked again for our order they were overdone.   After many many years of driving by this building I finally came in. Not underwhelmed because my expectations were in the right place. If yours are, you will not be underwhelmed either. It's basically bar food but without the bar. Not the worst I've ever had by any stretch, but never a place I'd circle a date on the calendar for. I'd come back simply for the volume of food and price point.

I don't give 5 stars very often.   Let me just start by saying that this dining adventure takes a while. Our reservation was at 715 and we left at 930. There are multiple courses and cooking times for your food. (The proteins are all delivered raw and you cook them yourself in the fondue pot.)  As long as your are comfortable with the fact that it is expensive, it takes a while to have the full experience, and that it is interactive (requires you to do your own cooking in the proteins) then you really should not have anything to complain about. As long as you know what you're in for, you'll have an amazing time.  As far as the quality of the food, the staff, the atmosphere and the flavors, I can only say one thing: DYNAMITE.   I have had more expensive meals in my life. Price does not dictate the quality of a meal. Everything adds up to be the best date night, special occasion, etc that my money can buy. Any time I want a special dining experience The Melting Pot is #1, #2, #3 on my list every single time. I just can't say enough positive things about it. If you think it's too good to be true, go find out for yourself. It's not and you'll thank me later.

Today I had the regular gyro combo with seasoned fries. The gyro was very good. The meat was tender, all the veggies were fresh, and the sauce was good and in the proper amount. Fries were on point. If I had room in my stomach I would order a 2nd gyro right now and not feel bad about it.  Casual atmosphere, everyone Greek in the kitchen. Place is clean. Food came out fast.  I have nothing against Greek food at all, but I rarely seek it out. My experience here was very pleasant and I will definitely be coming back. Well done.

The owner, Chris replaced my windshield today. He came all the way out to my work and installed the new windshield in less than an hour. It was very convenient that he was willing to come do this at my work.   He was courteous, professional, and did an exceptional job. And to top it all off, it cost me substantially less than I was quoted from Safelite.   I will have zero hesitation in recommending him to any friends or family that are looking to have similar procedures done. Couldn't have been a better experience.

First time here. I got the Deluxe Sampler (chicken, pork, brisket) and 2 sides (cornbread, Mac+cheese) because I wanted to try a little bit of everything.  It's not easy finding a good BBQ place in Arizona. This is the best one I've been to. All the meats were melt-in-your-mouth tender. My favorite was the brisket. Plastic fork, no knife needed for any of it. 4 sauces at the table (sweet, smoky, hot, zippy mustard) so you can have your choice of sauce. I tried them all and the sweet BBQ was my favorite.   Everything is made from scratch. The Mac and cheese was a strong co-star in the dish. I would have given 5 stars but the soda machine was broken so it was only tea, and I wanted a Coke to wash it all down with.  Very positive and recommended experience. I will be back for sure.
