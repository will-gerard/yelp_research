This is the best pho joint i've found since moving out to Phoenix. Good portions, reasonable prices and great selection.

Awesome place. I tend to stick to the more basic and traditional style pasties now, as the more unique ones just seem a little odd to me. I can't say I've ever had anything I didn't like though. Great beer selection as well.

I thought this would be a safe bet based on reviews I read here on yelp, but I was wrong. I sent in a request for a quote, which came very quickly though it was by text message. I didn't really mind getting a text, but it did seem unprofessional to me. I scheduled an appointment two days from that time, and didn't get any kind of confirmation. I sent a text about an hour before the appointment asking if they would still be coming and got no response. No show, no call, and no respect. Choose someone more professional.

Pretty good barber shop. They were quick and clean and finished off with a hot lather straight razor shave for the back of the head and sideburns and even busted out a shoulder massager. There was no wait time to get in a chair and each station has its own TV with DirecTV so you can watch whatever you like. It's definitely one of the better places I've been for a cut.

This is my favorite local bar. The PBR murals painted outside were definitely what got me in the door. It's a cool looking old building with it's own unique style. They have great 2 for 1 Happy hour specials and some good beer on tap (Four Peaks, Guinness...). The food is actually really good and everything is priced pretty well. The bartenders are pretty cool and helpful as well. I just moved into the area and they gave me some tips on where to find work and even told me about the 4 peaks brewery right around the corner. It's a place where I feel very welcome and relaxed. They usually have live music too. It's a great dive bar.. probably the best one that I have ever been to.

I have been coming to Tempe Tavern at least weekly since I moved here a few months ago. They have great happy hour specials and if that isn't enough to bro g you back, the staff is. Most of the bartenders are genuinely cool people who can relate to their customers and take really good care of them. If you come often enough you get to see nights where they have to deal with some pretty crazy situations. Makes for a good laugh. Between Sarah dealing with a toothless cowboy who asked her to take her clothes off, and Fran slipping into a bucket and having to strip down to a tank-top (which looked like a sports bra) it's always a good time. A bar is just a place to drink, it's the people who work there that make it a great place to keep coming back to. The staff at Tempe Tavern are a pretty cool group who sometimes have to put up with a lot of BS, often as the only employee in the joint, so if you go and you have a bad experience don't be too quick to judge. The bartender on duty has probably been alone, stressed, and busy for close to 7 hours. Doesn't happen often, but it does happen. I guarantee that if you give this place a chance, you'll keep coming back.

I hate to give these guys a bad review, but I feel that their overall review is just too positively biased. I took my iPhone 4 in after it fell in water. I have two main points to discuss.  1. I was charged $85 for them to run a diagnostic and clean it, just to find out there was nothing they could do to fix it. I wasn't overly optimistic that it could be fixed, but I was told that the store had a 70% success rate with water damaged phones. I'm not necessarily upset that they couldn't fix the phone, but I am upset that I had to pay almost $100 to find out it was broken. That money could have gone towards just buying a new phone.   2. Since my phone was broken I had to rely on email from the shop, which they said would be prompt. I brought my phone in about 45 minutes after they opened on a Monday and didn't hear anything back from them until I sent a follow up email to them around noon the next day to see what the status was. I would have preferred to know that they couldn't do anything sooner, rather than anxiously wait to see if I got lucky or not.  Overall, it's a decent place and the staff is courteous enough, but it's expensive. I hate to seem biased, I know with water damage there often isn't much anyone can do. I would have just preferred that they charged less and kept in better contact with me.

I went to Apple XChange after i dropped my iphone and shattered the back glass. I had previously used another store, MacMasters, up in Scottsdale who charged me over 200 bucks just to do a diagnostic check on my old iphone when that wasnt working, and on top of that they had terrible customer service. Apple Xchange was the exact opposite. The customer service is great, and the prices are extremely fair. I originally had intended just to replace the broken back, but instead got a full color conversion for about 100 bucks that was done in less than an hour. Cory used to work for Apple, so the service is guaranteed to be good quality. You get the expertise of an Apple tech at more reasonable prices and better service. I highly recommend this store to anyone who needs their Apple products to be serviced.

If you know your pho this is not the place for you. They had a super limited selection, and the portions were small. I was really upset they didn't have anything with tendons or tripe. The broth was pretty good but everything else was sub par. Service was also pretty bad... there are a lot of places near by that are way better.

4 stars because the food was amazing, but the service was really bad. I had to hunt down the waitress for refills on water, sake, and even things as trivial as brining me my whole order. I got the spicy beef hot pot which was way spicier than I thought it would be (which I loved) but she forgot to bring utensils and the side of rice that comes with it etc. overall definitely check it out if you like hot pot. Totally worth it. Just be prepared for sub par service.
