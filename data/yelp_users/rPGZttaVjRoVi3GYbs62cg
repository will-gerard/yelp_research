Oh shit!  Literally.    I was at this location on Sunday night (2/25/07) and it was horrible.  The first thing we noticed was that there weren't any dishes.  It was like nothing new was being washed and brought out for customers to use.  Then the place started to smell bad... and then we noticed the waste water bubbling up from the floor drains behind the salad bar.  It was like something out of a horror movie.  We left in a hurry... a drainage grate in the parking lot was flowing with more raw sewage.  It was amazingly gross.    Any good experiences I've ever had in this place are moot... I'm never going back to this location again.

Yes!  This place was soooo good.  Several veggie options... delicious Yakisoba.  I'm looking forward to trying out their sister-restaurant, Eastwind.  Went on a Saturday night and it was VERY busy.  I can't wait to go back, just not during peak hours.

This small Japanese bakery makes really amazing desserts.  The shop itself isn't much to look at but the pasteries inside are delicious!  Treat yourself to some flavored sponge cakes (green tea, coconut, coffee... ect.) and pick a couple up for friends!    Credit/Debit card purchases must be over $5 or else bring cash.

I stopped by the Cypress Pita Grill last weekend and treated myself to a salad and side of greek fries.   The portions were large... the "side order" of fries would have been plenty for two people to share.  My salad was filled with all my favorite stuff... crisp lettuce, tomato, olives, and feta surrounded by soft pita triangles.  The fries were swimming in feta and dressing... mmm, so good.    I'm looking forward to going back and stuffing myself on more fries!

The "Supreme Master" is one of my favorite restaurants in town.  The menu is entirely vegetarian with many vegan options.    My favorite meal: three-striped vegetable soup, a spring roll with sweet and sour sauce and kung-pow beef with brown rice.   Mmm, mmm good!  My only complaint is the the restaurant is often very quiet and the wait staff is VERY quiet and reserved.  Still, it's a great place to bring a group of friends and have a good time.

This place it cool!  I stopped here for the first time last Saturday with my husband to grab some lunch.  It was a little overwhelming at first.  Parking was a bit confusing since valet seems to have claimed a majority of the lot, but after idling around for a few moments I was able to grab a prime spot right in front.  It was very busy!  There was a line of people trickling out the door, waiting to place their orders... but before we reached the counter our order was taken by a woman with a clipboard.  It was a bit rushed so we didn't feel like we had enough time to fully look over the menu.  I decided on the French pancakes (crepes) with fresh cream, honey and fruit and my husband ordered a pizza (which is tossed up next door).  My food was ready almost immediately so I grabbed my plate and we sat next door in the pizzeria.  It took a little while for the pizza to cook (which is expected) but by then I was nearly done with my meal... still, it was delicious.   We'll be back soon, I'm sure.

Like Megan, I don't want to feed my dog the usual cheap crap you can get from the grocery store, so I shop here instead.  They carry high-quality food, treats and toys.  Great for anyone who loves to spoil their furry "kids".  This place always cheers me up too.  I know animals in cages can make some folks sad but I can't resist oogling over their piles of baby hamsters and fuzzy, yellow ducklings.  Even the reptiles are cool.  It's like a one-stop shop for kibble, toys and cuteness!

I took my car to Cobblestone for an oil change and car wash combo because I had a coupon to save a couple bucks.    The moment I pulled up to the service center the employees started to try to pressure me into additional (expensive) add-ons.  No man, I don't want to buy an $80 pre-paid card to get my car detailed, I just want it friggin' washed and I want to go home.    I talk to the guy in the shop and he tried to sell me crap to go along with my oil change too.  I say no, I don't want to get my coolant system flushed today, so he offers to knock $10 off the price.  That just makes me realize how much he was overcharging me to begin with.    Let me be clear, the car wash service was excellent!  I got what I paid for, but it wasn't worth the hassle.    ------------------------  EDIT:  I go to this place to get gasoline because it's near the house.  The other day, while I was filling up, I watched as Cobblestone employees took gas from the pump, dumped it on the ground and lit it on fire.    My god!  Fire and gas stations DON'T MIX!  I hope they all explode and remove themselves from the gene pool!

I went to Labcorp to have my blood drawn.  It's hard to say something nice about people who poke me with needles... but their staff was lighthearted and kind to a poor girl who's squeamish about giving blood.    -1 star because their lobby is small and their lovely flat-screen tv only loops mind-numbing healthcare "infomercials".

Atomic is the best place in town for all your comic needs.  They always order a decent number of new releases so you shouldn't have a problem getting a copy of any new issue.  In addition to comics they have t-shirts, posters, card games, toys, candy and all sorts of other geeky junk.    If it's something they don't carry in their store let them know and they'll find you a copy.  The staff is friendly and happy to help you find whatever you are looking for... or make some suggestions if you're just getting in to comics.  (Watch out for the swarms of kids on the weekends.  They come to hang around all day playing Pokemon and can really crowd the place.)

Yuck!  Why did I do this to myself?  I was running a few errands on Christmas eve afternoon and I decided to grab a sandwich for lunch.    I could tell these poor bastards running the place didn't want to be there but I wasn't making it hard on them, I just wanted a vegetarian sub.  The bread was old and smushed (resembling a slice of plain white bread) the toppings were unimaginative and sparce and the cheese was overly processed into something resembling Velveta.  If you want a sandwhich, don't waste your time here... Einstein's, Quizno's, even Subway could do better.

This place has some pretty tasty lunch specials... pick a meal and get salad, cinnamony won-ton chips and rice for $7 (plus drink and tip).  The veggie stir-fyr is really yummy.    It can get pretty crowded around lunchtime so go early, but the service is fast, so once you are seated you won't need to wait long for your food.

The bagels and pasteries here are delicious.  Maybe it's a good thing this place isn't closer to my house or I would eat here all the time.  Mmmm, carbs!  As Max said, it's not really a young, hip place to hang out but they make good eats.  Swing by and grab some bagels to go and be sure to pick up an amazing cranberry muffin.  I swear, they are like the size of your fist!

Togo's is not the place to go if you want a veggie sub.  I can't comment on the quality of the meats but their vegetarian options are boring.  What's the point of a cheddar cheese sub if they can't toast it?!?  Oh, the humanity!

This place was so weird!  I had heard good things from friends (and other Yelpers) but I was so disappointed!  My fella and I went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and were the only customers there (!?).  We were shown to a table by a unfriendly gentleman who did not smile or greet us in any way.   He returned to take our order, gave us a cold glare to tell us that he disapproved of our choices, and then wandered off to the kitchen.  We could hear him yelling at the cook to "make sure to make my vegetarian lasagna WITHOUT meat in it"... yeah, thanks, I would appreciate that.  Eventually he brought us our food, scowled, and left us alone for the rest of our meal.  What was up with this old man?  Who ran over his puppy?  Also, someone was fiddling with the music in the place, eventually deciding we should all listen to hip-hop.  :|  The food was tasty, but the experience ruined it.  I won't be coming back anytime soon.

On Feb 7th, 2008 I attended the "world premiere" performance of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde.  I loved it!  The cast was extremely talented and diverse (I like it when ladies play male roles).  I found the material to be engrossing, dark and sophisticated.  It seemed to be hit or miss with the audience... I saw some people leaving during intermission, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself and I'll be recommending it to others.  Along with a handful of other Yelpers, I also attended the January 5th performance of The Pajama Game.  Now, let me preface this by saying that I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I did have an ok time.  The cast was a gifted group and bursting with energy!  The set and costumes were colorful and creative and the 7-person orchestra was wonderful!  The story itself is the only thing that didn't thrill me... as to be expected for a musical, the plot is just fluff.  Overall I give 5 stars to the skilled group of actors that make up the company.  I can't wait to see more (I'll just steer clear of the musicals)!

The Paper Heart is a cute, intimate venue... I felt really comfortable there.  There are couches and folding chair that surround the stage.  Not tons of seating but the place is small.      I'm not a drinker so I can't comment on the booze but they had a selection of cheap sodas, energy drinks, tea and water.  Ooh, another good thing, no smoking inside!    My fella and I went there to see the Scandalesque burlesque show (second Friday, every month) which was a mixture of entertaining and strange.  I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, it was one of the weirdest shows I have ever seen.

I went to the Orpheum Theater last week (to hear Barack Obama speak).  This place is amazing!  The venue is so beautiful!  I would love to go back to see a theater production .  It would be a great place to get dressed up and have a classy, romantic evening with a "significant other".  I'm not sure quite how to describe the style... kind of a Spanish Renaissance... the place is immaculate.  Go check it out!

I didn't have my ears pierced for the first 25 years of my life.  "Why?"  You might ask.  Because growing up, being a teenager, I never wanted to be given cheesy, gaudy earrings as a gifts from grandparents, aunts or friends.  Earrings were always the lame fallback gift that girls received when the giver couldn't think of anything better.  I wanted nothing to do with it.  It was only after I felt I had battled the horrible earring scourge long enough that I went to Halo.  I was so impressed by the professionalism of the staff and their eagerness to answer any questions I had.  The facility was immaculately clean and the piercer was very knowledgeable and experienced.    I would recommend them to anyone getting piercing done... I'm thinking about going back for some additional work myself.

Wonderful museum and a beautiful collection on contemporary art.  It was a great selection of diverse styles and mediums, I really enjoyed it.  I visited specifically to see the Maya II art installation, little did I know it's not actually housed in the museum but viewable for free in the Center for the Arts lobby next door.  -1 star because it's not big enough.  Get rid of the gift shop and hang more art!

Pei Wei is pretty good eats, and you always know what you are going to get.  The food is good quality, the place is well run, and it's clean.    They have a pretty good selection of veggie items, and I really like how they prepare tofu (it's like, baked & grilled... or something).  Plus, their orange iced-tea is really tasty.

One of my top-five places to eat in town (I know, I'm a cheap date).  Their toasted subs are fresh, fast and amazingly good.   What is it that makes this place so delicious?  I dunno, it just is.  Mention Cheba Hut to any one who has tasted it before and watch their eyes light up.  It's just that good.  Several premium choices for vegetarians.  My weapon of choice 'The Humbolt' (hold the onions).  Try the thick, fudgy 'hemp' brownies for dessert.

Green is under new management and has aquired a totally new design since it was known as "Veggie Fun".  Gone is the kitchy decor - it's new, hip facelift makes it a place that you aren't afraid to bring family or friends.  A rotation of artists are now featured with their art on the walls, so there is always something new to see.  The food is generally good, but some items are a hit-or-miss.  I highly recommend the Mongolian Beef and a vegan soft-serve cone for dessert.

Goodbye Gentle Strength!  You were a pretty good store and I'm really sorry to see you go.    GS carried some great products that you couldn't find anywhere else, but aside from being "family" run there was nothing dramatic to set it apart from Sprouts or Wild Oats.  I guess the campus just didn't have the customer base to keep a little hippy-food shop thriving.  Ah well.  Cheers to you Gentle Strength!

The Creative Quest is a terribly cute little store in old-town Glendale.  The shop sells all manner of handmade papers, rubber stamps, scrapbooking notions and book-binding supplies.  I originally found this store because it's a great place to buy origami paper.  They take the paper remnants and cut them into squares to be sold in bulk, variety bags.  It's an amazing deal for a collection of fine, textured paper.  Check out their website for the workshops going on each month!

Bad Donkey is the north Phoenix answer to Cheba Hut.  No, it's not the same, but if you are jones'n for a top-quality toasted sub it's a good place to go.  I had their "Grass on a Roll"  - whole bunch a fresh veggies, cheese with "Bad Donkey Sauce".  Good eats!  Cute place, good food and a very friendly staff.

Via Delosantos is one of the few places in Phoenix that a vegetarian can get a good Mexican meal.  Neither the beans or rice are cooked in lard, which is hard to find in this town.  The chips and salsa are premium, just watch out for the fried potatoes and such - very greasy.  Thanks to Philip's illuminating review, I hadn't heard about their health code violations.  It's something I'll keep an eye on in the future though... if they take another dive like they did in 2004 I'll keep my distance for a while.

I've been a Chino junkie the past couple weeks.  It's so good!  I love their veggie quesadilla... and you get a big, soft Snickerdoodle with your meal too.  This place isn't much to look at, but it's clean and well maintained.  Go experience the Mexican/Chinese fusion for yourself!

My husband and I stopped  at Sugar & Ice one morning as we were waiting for shops to start opening at 10am.  The food and drink were a little pricey, but good.  I had a delicious iced latte and we sat out on the patio watching the waterfall.  It was relaxing, and a great way start off the morning.

Weather & Coffee is a wonderful little coffeeshop at the corner of Bell Rd. + Piestawa Fwy.  The place is artfully designed and has a weather theme (it's owned by a former tv weatherman).  The staff is always very friendly and service is fast!  I'm not much of a coffee drinker but they have a nice selection of delicious, freshly made teas.  Their muffins and bagels are darn good too.    I would choose an independently-owned shop like this over Starbucks any day.  Edit - CLOSED

I didn't like Daphne's.  It's bland, overpriced Greek food.    I got a falafel pita, side of fries and a drink - something that might be considered a cheap lunch special somewhere else - but it cost me nearly $8 and it wasn't good.    It gets two stars for being edible, but not tasty.

I almost wept when I saw they had opened a Slices at this end of town.   I don't know what makes this pizza so wonderful, but it's delicious.  Try the veggie or white pizza... I hear the potato bacon is good too.    The downside:  The place is usually wicked hot inside.  I dunno if they are trying to save a couple bucks and not run the A/C but those ovens make it warm!  Just grab your slices and go sit outside in the foodcourt area instead.

Chipotle is one of my favorite places to eat thats fast and cheap.    The menu is pretty straight-forward.  Tacos, burritos, bowls... pick your ingredients, move along.  Your meal will be assembled at light-speed so stay sharp!  If you really only want a LITTLE BIT of sour cream or salsa or whatever, say so LOUDLY and CLEARLY or else it will get slopped on there like everything else.    It can get really crowded during weekday lunch, go at 11:00 or 1:00 to avoid the rush - or if you are going to pick up, fax your order in ahead of time.

Bookman's is a really great resource if you are looking get rid of some old books, movies, music or videogames.  Bring your stuff in and they they'll give you a fair amount of trade credit that you can spend on items in the store.  DO NOT bring in old items expecting to walk out with a handful of CASH... unless an item is really coveted expect to get pennies on the dollar.  Sometimes it's hard to find the item I'm looking for.  They don't have any sort or computerized inventory and their selection is always changing.  The store is huge though, allow plenty of time to wanted around and flip through some pages.  At the very least I can usually leave with a almost-new magazine, marked down half price.  Can beat a deal like that.

I feel bad for the guy that manages this place.  Every time we have gone in there it's dead and this fella is so desparate to get us to buy something.  He actually said "you would be stupid not to pre-order (this game)."      Calling your customers stupid is not a good way to make a sale, friend.    It gets two stars because it's a good place to take *newer* used games.  If something is on their "Wanted" list they will give you good trade credit for it, but otherwise, don't give him a cent.

Matsuri is a yearly festival that takes place in downtown Phoenix every spring.  I have been attending (and volunteering) at this festival for more than 5 years and it's grown overwhelmingly in that time.  Matsuri started as a major showcase and auction for koi owners in the valley but it has grown to a big event that's enjoyable for everyone.    The festival features vendors selling native and pop-culture items from Japan, a display of Bonsai and fine art, and entertainment of martial arts, music and fashion.  Keep an eye on the website for dates and information.

Pita Jungle is a great place to get inexpensive Mediterranean food (as long as you don't mind a bit of a wait).  The food usually gets served up really fast, but then your waiter leaves and -never comes back-.  I'm not ususally a stickler for outstanding wait service, but I do like to get my glass refilled and be given my check in a timely manner.  Never-the-less, the food is so good it makes up for any other flaws.

Cheers to Camelview for being one of the only theaters to show independent and "art house" films on this side of town.    The venue is well maintained but small (and no stadium seats).  Still, can't be too picky when it's the only theater in the valley that is showing what you want to see.      Seating can be very limited for popular movies so it might be beneficial to buy tickets ahead of time.

My co-workers and I refer to this place as "Pizza n' Ants".  The staff will be happy to serve you with bare hands, right after using the till.  Also, as the nickname suggests, there has been a noticable insect problem.     As if that could all be overlooked, the pizza isn't even good.  If you are in this part of town, go to Z Pizza or Slices for great pizza instead!

Z Pizza has great lunch specials.  I love their slice, salad and a drink deal you can get for about $7.  Very convienent for a quick workday lunch.    It's a hard decision whether to eat at Slices or Z Pizza.  I really like the food at both, but Z wins an extra star for always being well maintained (and cool) inside.

I have a fiendish love/hate relationship with Red Robin.    On one hand it's a obnoxious chain restaurant.  The walls are covered with kitchy memorabilia and neon lights.  The music is loud and unpleasant.  There videogames in the lobby and balloons for the kids.  It makes me feel like such a tool.    But why do I go there?  Why can't I turn away?  Because they serve up the tastiest veggie burger I know.  It comes on a big, toasted bun, piled with toppings, grilled to perfection and accompanied by an endless supply of thick, seasoned fries.    I like Red Robin.  There I said it.

Very nice dog park with ample space for pups to run and play.  The area is divided into "small dog" and "large dog" areas.  It was really fun to have a chance for my little dog to run around and make friends!  I would recommend coming during a cool part of the day and bringing a folding chair.  There is only one stationary bench in each area so if I had know I would have brought my own chair to sit in the shade.  Open from 5:30 am to sunset.  No dog-watering facilites on site so bring your own water and bowls!  Mutt-Mitt dog waste dispensers in each area.

IKEA is pretty cool.  It's like an adventure in over-stimulation!  So much too look at.  I usually end up leaving with completely random crap... like a spatula, stick of bamboo, hangars and Swedish cookies... all for $4.95.    It is a bit frustrating to find something big that I really do need (a new bookshelf) and I can't even come close to fitting it in my car.  I guess that's when it's time to borrow the parent's SUV and make a return trip.  :/

I have a "thing" for beads.  I don't even do anything with them... I just like to look at them.  They are just so shiny, almost hypnotizing.    Anyhow, BeadWorld has a wonderful selection of beads and charms.  Amazing crystals, silver and beads by the strand and in bulk.  It's right next to the Asahi Bakery too, so get yourself a snack!

Being a vegetarian, you'd think I would dig this place... but it's not so hot.  The toppings are mediocre, the dressing choices are not good and it's really expensive!  (Expect to spend around $10 for lunch and a drink.) For that kind of money I would much rather go to Sweet Tomatoes instead.

This place was pretty damn good.  It's like Taco Del Mar, but better.  You can get sauteed vegetables put in your burrito or tacos and they even have grilled, seasoned tofu!  I'm in heaven.  All the menu items are names after pop-culture references... I had "The Ugly naked Guy" a la Friends.  I was amused.  I guess the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because, in the end, it's just a cheap taco joint... but if you are in the mood for that, hit it up!

Nice shopping center with some of my favorite stores all in one convienent place.  Target Greatland, Old Navy, PetsMart, Barnes & Noble, Jillian's and Slices!  Still, it is just a mall (and has more boring chain restaurants then you can shake a stick at) but it's casual and well designed.  I prefer it over an indoor mall any day.

Phoenix's Japanese Friendship Garden is one of the most beautiful places in the city.  Pick a cool weekend and go enjoy youself.  The park is lush and green with a walking path and areas to sit and look out over the pond.  You can buy a cup of koi food in the gift shop, then sit at the water's edge and feed those big guys.  Fish lips ahoy!  Admission is only $3, and free on First Friday evenings.  (For anyone who may have been to the Japanese garden in San Diego's Balboa Park, our Japanese garden kicks it's ass!)

Every Saturday morning I head over to Brambly Hedge and spend time helping take care of the bunnies.  BH is an amazing rescue dedicated to the well being of over 100 domestic house rabbits.  As Jack said, rabbits make wonderful pets.  They are warm, soft, clever and full of love!  Of course, I have a few favorites, but every bunny here has their own unique character and would love to go home with you!  If you are interested in adopting, check out www.bhrabbitrescue.org/ and drop by one of their adoption events.  You'll get to meet a hand-picked group of lovable buns and talk to professionals about any questions you my have.

Qdoba is just another cheap Mexican place (very similar to Chipotle) but it's still really good!  Expect the usual combinations of rice, bean, meat, etc... but they have a wider variety of choices like taco salads and quesidillas too.  The place was clean and the staff was quick, helpful and polite.  Plus Qdoba offers a frequent buyers card and you can redeem your "points" for free food.  Eveybody like free food!

This review is specifically for this location and NOT ALL Einstein's.  This particular store has the most piss-poor service and product!  Here are a couple examples: Last week I ordered a salad to-go.  They made it "fresh", put it in a bag and I took it back to work.  Upon arriving back at work I realized they didn't include the bread that comes with it.  :(  When I started eating the salad it was a fresh layer of lettuce on top of a slimy-brown layer underneath.  Barf!  This morning I had to wait 20 minutes to get a toasted bagel and cream cheese to-go!!  There was this guy next to me that was fuming!  I guess he was waiting for an order that he had faxed in the night before and they still hadn't filled.  This place needs to have more people on staff and train them better.  Really, making bagels couldn't be that hard!  If you are in the area, go to the Einstein's on Thunderbird + 40th St., the manager there is wonderful!

This is a great place to do some easy walking/hiking.  Not nearly as strenuous as Piestawa Peak and not as crowded.  The area is clean and the air is fresh.  Plus, there is a good chance you'll see some wildlife (hawks, rabbits, insects, ect.).  Plenty of parking and a few ramadas with picnic tables.  -1 star because, at points, you can still see the highway... but once you get past the first couple hills it's like you are in the middle of nowhere.  (Directions:  Exit the SR-51 at Northern and head east to the parking area.  The Yelp map shows the incorrect location.)

I'm in LOVE with Cornish Pasty Co!  If you've never had a pasty (pass-tee) before, picture a big pocket made from buttery-flaky crust and filled with your heart's desire!  They have nearly a dozen delicious, vegetarian pasties to choose from!  I love the Veggie Oggie filled with veggie-steak, potatoes, rutabaga and onions.  Mmmmm!  Pre-order 45 minutes before hand and they'll custom make you a vegan one!  My only complaint?  Since the place is so small it can really heat up because of the ovens.  Be prepared, it can get pretty hot in there!

Cartridge World is one of those places that refills old print cartridges and sells them back at a reduced price (about 50% cheaper than a new one).  I've been to them twice, the first time I didn't have any problems but this most recent visit was a pain.  I took in my HP cartridge and they didn't have any replacements in stock so the lady there offered to refill the one I brought in.  I agreed and I left my phone number so she could call me when it was ready... she said it would take about an hour.  3 hours later she calls and I go pick it up.  She says she wasn't very confident that the refilling job worked and if I have any problems I can return it the next day.  I did have a problem, it printed horribly... I can't believe she even gave it to me like that.  I returned it and she didn't make any effort to find a replacement from another store or order one for me.  I left empty handed and I won't be going back to that location.

I had a great time playing trivia with the Yelp crew last night!    Not so much in the way of vegetarian-friendly cuisine (which is to be expected, since it's an Irish pub) but what I did eat was good!  The curry fries were great.  Big slabs of potato and a large cup of mango curry for dunking.  Gabi also treated us to some sweet strawberry crepes that were wonderful!  I washed it all down with a glass of Strongbow apple cider too.  The trivia itself was fun.  I think it went on a little too long (two hours) but it was a well-rounded selection of questions.  Team "Go Yelp Yourself" did pretty well.  Overall, a great night out!

I tried Zoe's for the first time last night.  It was "ok" but not "great".    There are *very few* vegetarian options, so I settled on a grilled cheese with tomato.  Ya know, when you go to a restaurant and actually order grilled cheese, you might hope it would be something special... maybe with a little flair.  This didn't have it.  It looked identical to something I could have made in a frying pan at home... and it came with a bag of plain 'ol Lays potato chips.   I guess the saving grace was the side of  "marinated slaw".  Fresh shredded cabbage, scallions, feta cheese and a light vinagrette.  It was pretty tasty but not good enough to justify the nearly $10 I spent on the meal (with a soda).  Sadness!  I wanted this place to be some great (easy food) alternative to the Chipotle across the street .

I made a special trip all the way to Desert Sky Mall out of pure curiosity for Steve & Barry's.  A whole clothing store where everything is $8.95?  Intriguing!  I'm sorry to say I didn't really like it.  The store was pretty messy, the t-shirts were tacky and every time I found a pair of pants or jeans I liked they were out of my size.  It might be a good place to pick up some new workout clothes for the gym, but I wouldn't make a trip all the way across town for that.    I think you could buy comparable clothes at Kohls, Mervyns or Target and not spend much more.

Freddy's is a great place to grab a quick meal.  It has a retro-diner kind of feel, with black and white patterned tile and red vinyl seats, but it's fast food so you can order at the counter or through the drive-thru.  I haven't had their "famous" steak burger, but their veggie burger is delicious.  It comes piled high with toppings and accompanied by skinny seasoned fries (if you get the combo).  Their frozen custard is wonderful as well, and they have a huge variety of mix-ins to choose from.  I got toasted coconut!  Mmmmm!  5 stars easy!

Jillian's is hard to put a finger on because it's so many things.  Upscale arcade and bowling, dance club, bar, pool hall and a couple different restaurants.  For the purpose of my review, I'm going to focus on the arcade.   I'm a skee-ball fiend and it has some premium lanes.  The whole arcade is very clean and well maintained.  It can be pretty crowded with families of kids but you have to remind yourself that you are on their turf.  The downside is that Jillian's uses one of those "credit card" point systems that makes it a little harder to keep track of how much you are actually spending on games.   What ever happened to the honest 1 quarter to 1 token ratio?!

We don't have Panera in Phoenix, so getting to eat at one is a treat.  I had a huge salad of walnuts, strawberries, blueberries and other fruits on a bed of romaine and it was fabulous!  It came with a big hunk of fresh bread too.  Simple and good.  I wish I could eat there more often.

Quark's Bar is geek haven!  It's fun and cheezy, so make sure you bring a sense of humor.  During our short vacation we went to Quark's twice!  Both times we sat at the bar, enjoying the company of the other patrons (fellow geeks), the continual feed of Next Generation episodes on the flat-screen and the delicious, potent drinks.    I dare you to be berated by a tall, menacing Klingon and not leave with a smile on your face!

Veggie Delight isn't much to look at, but they have great vegetarian food.  The decor inside is quite spartan, and we were the only patrons, but I didn't let that deter us.  I had a delicious "pork chop" sandwich on a soft roll with a spicy carrot relish-like mix inside and washed it down with a refreshing coconut milk tea.  Jeeze, it was good!  I also sampled a little of my husband's vegetable and tofu dish, which was really yummy too.  If you're looking for some fresh & tasty veggie food, check this out.

Zaba's isn't anything fancy.  It's pretty standard "Chipotle-like" Mexican food but it really hit the spot after a long day of walking around on the strip.  It was great to find a place offering fresh & healthy, vegetarian-friendly fare.    No complaints.

No.  I just don't dig this place.  Maybe because i'm a vegetarian, and there are only, like, two things on the menu I can eat.  Their veggie sandwich has this mustard-bile spread on it that doesn't strike my fancy.      Two stars because it isn't poison (I would eat there if I had to) and you get a one of their delicious cookies with your sandwich.

This was my first time trying boba, and it was delicious!  Eba has an amazing selection of drinks (and ways to prepare them).  I decided on tea+soymilk, boba with coconut flavor.  Mmmm!  It was sweet and creamy and wonderful.  The cafe itself is bright and welcoming.  I joined several other Yelpers there for Office Hours and we lounged on comfy couches.  In addition to food they sell a selection of gifty items too.  Is it sad to admit that I craved MORE later that day?  Yeah, that's right... if this place wasn't so far from my house, I might have gone back for seconds.

If I didn't have better restraint, I could see myself spending a lot of money in this place.  The selection is kinda sparse, but what they do have is a colorful variety of vinyl toys, books, shirts and art.  I was immediately drawn to the display cases of open-box vinyl toys.  I fluttered against the glass like some monstrous moth to a flame.  I wanted them all (but, responsibly, settled for a single Dunny Azteca).  The adult in me knows better than to go back and blow all my cash on toys, but it would be a great place to buy gifts for others.

I recently flew Northwest from Phoenix to Detroit, then a smaller plane from Detroit to Pellston (northern Michigan).  Overall, the flight was pretty lousy.  It's hard to make 5 hours in a plane appealing, but Northwest didn't try to make things any easier.  - No movie.  NW Airlines only shows films on international flights. - No in-flight radio. - No peanuts.  Isn't that our reward for being good little passengers?!? - Scarce pillows and blankets (this was important to note because the plane was soooo cold). - Flight Attendents use the intercom to try and sell their rewards progams and special deals for the SkyMall cataloge.  Booo!  I don't want to hear your freakin' sales pitch!  Leave me in peace!  Why did I even give them 2 stars?  They have assigned seating (unlike SW) and we didn't crash and die.

I took one TED flight to Portland, OR and a United flight to return.    They make flying as painless as possible.  The staff is friendly.  They are prompt with snacks and drinks.  There is a wide selection of radio stations to listen to.  For flights 1.5 to 3 hours they screen a selection of TV shows, over 3 hours and you get a movie.  What makes time go faster than watching a classic episode of the Simpsons or clips from SNL?  If I get a choice of what to fly, I'll go with United anytime.

Souvia is a lovely little tea store.  For anyone who enjoys a top-quality tea I highly recommend trying this place... they have over 100 different varieties of loose-leaf.  They also offer classes in "tea appreciation" and advanced tastings.    The only reason I'm not giving then five stars is because the ambiance is so spartan.  There are tables and chairs if you would like to enjoy a pot of tea in the shop but it doesn't have a very cozy feeling.    The shop is aimed at selling loose teas, and that's what they do well.

The top of the Eiffel Tower provides a nice view and a cheap thrill (especially for folks like me who are too chicken for roller coasters).  We went up at dusk and had a great view of the setting sun and growing luminance of the neon on the Strip.  We were able to go up without waiting in any lines, but beware, by the time the sun had set there was a pretty long line of people waiting to go up.

I took my husband to C4 this week and we enjoyed some dinner and drinks.  The food and space were a solid four stars.  For appetizers we shared Chips & 3 Dips, Tres Queso Quesidilla and then I had the Veggie & Tortilla Soup while he had a House Salad for entrees.  I think we both agreed next time we might just get appetizers, drinks and dessert.  Here is the part that really bumped it up to 5 stars... "Sunsets at the Clarendon"!    Lounging on the rooftop patio with a Margarita in hand, listening to a great DJ, looking out over the city and watching the sun set.  Lovely!  We'll be sure to come back, and bring friends.

Last night I enjoyed a tasty meal at Sonoma with a bunch of other Yelpers.  We were teated to a nice spread including vegetarian pasta primavera (spicy!), buttery rolls, salads, cookies, brownies and strawberries!  YUM!  Good eats!  The place had a nice layout that could accommodate our large group with no problems.  The staff was attentive and the manager took the time to chat with our group.  The place was very clean and well lit too.  Next time I'm downtown I would not hesitate to stop there again.

I dunno if there is much I can say that hasn't already been said.    I went to Ice Tango for the first time last night and really liked it!  I tried the Twangy Tart (which tastes tart, just like real yogurt, only frozen) topped with fresh raspberries.  Very tasty!   I'm looking forward to going back and trying the green tea custard.

This place is a real gem!  I feel so lucky that it's right across the street from my house.  Fido's Funhouse is a wonderful doggie day/overnight camp, groomer and boutique.  I've taken my pomeranian there on a couple different occasions for both grooming and daycamp and I'm so impressed.  The place is immaculately clean, the staff is knowledgeable & friendly, and the dogs are well taken care of.  Day camp consists of either a full or half day of supervised play in their indoor playground (separated into big and small dogs).  Overnight means your dog gets 12 hours of play in addition to their own sleeping cabin and fleece bed (no cages here!) and 24-hour supervision.  Stop on in and take a tour of the place, it's so cool!

This place is both fresh and easy, as promised, but I can't quite give it 5 stars.  F&E is clean, no-frills and easy to navigate.  I like that they have minimal variety, the point is to get in and out fast, so I don't need a million choices.  There are a few products here I really love too (their Spanish rice, chocolate pudding, Orchard Fruit cereal and pretzel sticks).  What I don't like is when they are completely out of something!  I know, this happens at "regular" grocery stores too... but if the point of your store is to offer minimal (but quality) selection you *need* to keep the shelves full!  Maybe it's just growing pains, but I can't call them "wonderful" until they can keep themselves fully stocked.

I really dig Chompie's new location in PV Mall.  Much nicer than the dated '80 murals and design of the old 32nd street location.  Chompie's is always my standby when I feel like having breakfast for dinner.  Last night I treated myself to some delicious whole wheat pancakes (they have a nice hint of cinnimon) and some hash browns.  It was tasty and filling.  No complaints.  The service at Chompie's has always been excellent.  The staff is friendly and you get served quickly.

I feel kinda bad for Mocha Bianca... it isn't in a very good location.  It's a cute, little coffee shop in a dank strip mall, bumpered at each end by a Burger King and a drive through liquor store.  It's also directly across the street from another independent cafe, and a couple blocks from a second one.  That's a lot of competition within a quarter mile!  Once your inside, it's a nice place!  It's decorated with dark, earthy tones.  There is plentiful seating and a nice selection of drinks and munchies.  I've stopped in on several occasions for some iced tea and a vegan cookie and have left satisfied.

Last night my fella and I were in the area eatin' some YC's and picking up some household junk at Target.  Afterwards we decided to go next door to the GameStop.  This store is really horrible!  The moment we stepped in the door we were leeched onto by the two guys working there.  These dudes were trying so hard to make a sale and it got me annoyed quickly.   They kept following us around, recommending games they hadn't even tried for themselves... just pulling random crap from the shelves.  All Gamestop's new games are marked full retail price, and that makes them $5-10 more than games sold at Target or Best Buy (in the same plaza).  The moral of the story is, if you need a new game, don't go here.

Ok, lemme get this straight.  A vegan restaurant, on my side of town, and it's delicious?!?  It's like a dream come true!  I had the Golden Soy Chicken Delight and it was wonderful.  Thin slices of  "chicken" in a ginger & green onion sauce with rice and steamed veggies.  My fella had the Vegetable Fried Rice which was a huge plate of rice, veggies and tofu.  We shared a sweet, icy glass of mint lemonade too.  Mmmmm, it was all so good and I can't wait to go back!  Update:  I've been back twice since my original review.  I had the Golden Soy Chicken again, and the Pho.  My husband and I also shared some chocolate cake.  Everything was so good!  I love this place!

To be honest, I didn't really know what "Italian ice" was until I tried Scala's.  I had been imagining something like Hawaiian ice... roughly shaved, garish colors and flavors.  I was SO WRONG!  Italian ice is delicate, smooth and delicious.  I had the mint chocolate chip... sweet, not too minty and wonderful.  My husband had the root beer, which was awesome too (and would have made a great float with soft serve, which they offer as well).  If you are looking for a cool treat (and and a lighter, less filling alternative to ice cream) try Scala's.

Mmm!  Delicious Indian food and a great selection of vegetarian dishes.  I LOVE the fact that each dish is mildly spiced, and left up to the individual to customize the flavor depending on which sauces they choose.  I'm a spicy lightweight so it was great that I didn't have to worry about getting something too hot to enjoy.  I had a bowl of brown rice, cumin potatoes and tofu masala with a cool yogurt-cucumber-mint sauce on the side.  It was fantastic!  I can't wait to go back.  ...also, I thought it was adorable that we were given a golden dollar coin with our check for "making the drive to their location and to compensate for high-gas prices".  A memorable gesture!

I hate to write bad reviews, but this place sucks.  I'm a vegetarian, and I loves me some salad, but Tossed is just too pricey for what you get.  I've tried it a couples times, but I won't be going back.  $8-9 dollars gets you a salad, but for that price I think it SHOULD come with a fountain drink and a nice hunk of bread.  Really, you're just paying for a bowl of raw produce.  ...and what sort of salad place doesn't have plain ol' white mushrooms???  Yeah, they have portobello and shitaki but no "plain"?  Weird!

I just had a great experience with Lance at Thunderbird Computer Consulting.    My home computer had been out of commission for the past 2 days with a virus/trojan.  It was a complete mess and for all I tried I couldn't get the problem solved on my own.  I called Lance and he came out the next day and had my computer clean within an hour.  I'm so thankful!  He was efficient, friendly and inexpensive.  I would highly recommend him.

I love Dutch Bros. Coffee!  Their drinks are tasty, the baristas are friendly and it's really convenient.  They have excellent prices too.  It seems like I never have to pay full price for my drink.  Whether it's happy hour, coupons, punch cards or daily specials it seems like I always get a great discount.

If the opening of a new vegetarian restaurant is cause for me to celebrate, just imagine how happy I was after I tasted the food!  Jeremy and I checked Loving Hut on Friday for dinner.  It's a really cute place, spotlessly clean and the staff is very sweet and helpful with suggestions.  I had the steak sandwich (one of their chef's choice dishes) and it was great!  The steak itself was delicious, served on crusty french bread with crisp marinated veggies.  I had a beautiful orange-cranberry juice drink called the Orange Joy as well.  Mmmmm!  I can't wait to go back again this week and try something new.  Everything looks great and I'm so pleased to have a veggie place on the north side of town.

Congratulations to the pharmacists at Walgreen's for competing with Michael's Crafts & Fry's Electronics for the "Worst Customer Service Award".    Not only were you un-helpful but you also took the time to discount my concerns.  I know helping me answer some questions about over-the-counter allergy medicines can be tough, but you failed with flying colors.    Your refined degree of self-loathing is a shining example to us all.  Keep up the good work!

I haven't written a review in a while, but I wanted to break my silence to sing praises for this new Two Hippies location. I love having a place in my neighborhood where I can get quality, veg-friendly "fast" food.  The menu offers vegetarian tacos, burritos, loaded quesadillas, veggie burgers and tofu "sloppy joe" rice bowls in addition to a full selection of meat for you carnivores!
