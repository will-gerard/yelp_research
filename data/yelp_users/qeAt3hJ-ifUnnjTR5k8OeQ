Ok, you have all heard it before, but I am going to say it anyway. I love this place.  I always get the mozzarella sandwich and it is one of my favorite sandwiches, ever.  The homemade mozzarella is delicious, especially when they make it extra salty.  The bread is wonderful, always. It is a very large sandwich, you can easily save half for later if you want.  Lux next door has awesome lemonade, very sour.

This is one of my favorite places to eat.  It has the best chicken fried chicken I have ever had, and the mashed potatoes are excellent.  The salad is simple yet delicious.  The thing with Texaz grill is that I believe you can only go there and order 2 things off of their menu.  They are famous for the chicken fried chicken and the chicken fried steak, this is what you must order, and this is what everyone comes back for. If you are not a fan of these 2 items, then this place is not for you. Everything else on the menu is just average.  The portions are huge, you can easily split an order with someone, or take half of your meal home for left overs, which I think is a great value.  The decor is like a in the middle of nowhere Texas bar,  it's not fancy, and it's not meant to be.

I usually love Einsteins.  I love their blackberry lemonade and their six cheese bagels.  However I do not love this location.  It is right around the corner from my house, I do not even have to leave my residential roads to enter here, but I will never go here again.  Why do you ask?  It is because they have the worst customer service ever.  Every time I have been in here (which is about 6-7) they are very rude to me.  I do not know why.  I do not know if they are having a bad day or what but they are extremely unfriendly here, and its not always the same person. They lost my business for good.

All I can say is excellent in every aspect.  The fried chicken is mouth watering, the waffles are the best I have had, and the red kool aid is so damn good!  I don't know how they make the red kool aid like they do, but it's the best.  The service is always friendly and fast, and I have ate here numerous times.  I have never once had bad food or a bad experience.  Thank god I found this place in phoenix.

My favorite place to get a manicure and pedicure.  I come here about every 3 weeks as I get the gel manicure.  They do a fantastic job and they are friendly.  The pedicure always feels great and they don't skimp out.  They recently got all new spa chairs and they are wonderful.  Highly recommend.

Finally tried this place after many years of wanting to, and my husband and I were very disappointed.  Ever had the chicken fingers and fries at Ikea? Same exact food here except my fries at Ikea were cooked properly.  Overpriced processed food and unfriendly service.  Will never return.

My family and I ate here Saturday night.....based on the reviews of Yelp. We were not disappointed, as a matter of fact, we were pleasantly surprised with every aspect of our evening.  When you arrive at Bobby Q's, the outside makes it feel as if you are about to walk into a dive.  However when you turn the corner and walk in the door, that is not the case.  Very nice ambiance throughout the entire restaurant. They had wonderful mood lighting! I love low mood lighting!  Our server was very friendly and helpful.  Our meals were excellent.  My husband got the Chicken Fried Chicken and I got the Top Sirloin.  We started with the corn bread, which was delicious!  I don't care if it feel apart at least it wasn't dry!  My top sirloin was cooked a perfect Medium and seasoned exceptionally well.  I really loved it and I love steak.  Surprisingly the roasted corn was one of my favorites of the night, I don't usually gobble up corn when I get it with dinner, but man, this was some heavenly corn!  My husbands chicken fried chicken was perfect.  Pounded thin, with a light crispy batter, I hate to say it, but it might have been better than Texaz Grill's chicken!  It was tasty.  My son got the oven cooked pepperoni pizza and it was a large portion for the $4.00 price tag, he even took some home.  Our food was excellent, there wasn't one thing we didn't like, the food was hot, the service was great, the atmosphere was great, we will return!

This place was delicious.  I would really recommend humble pie. I have seen alot of people on here complain about the $7.00 fries, but they were the best (and unique) fries I probably have ever had.  The portion was also huge!  It was enough for my husband, my son and I to share.  I think that is worth $7.00.  We got 2 humble pies...1 was just pepperoni and mozzarella, the other was the margarita pie.  Both pies were very good, the crust is excellent, chewy and crispy, just the way I like it.  On the margarita pie we added prosciutto, which tasted a little funny to me, but other than that everything was excellent.  The decor was nice, it seems that they put alot into choosing it.  The only things that I didn't like were the music that they were playing, I don't think I should be subjected to Nickleback while I am eating, and our server wasn't very friendly. Other than that you should check this place out, and please don't skip the fries, just share them!

Finally tried this place, based on the reviews here.  I don't know if we went on a off day or what, but I was not impressed.  Service was good, very friendly, however the food is another matter.  I have had alot of bbq in my time.  I am from Ohio and have eaten my fair share, this was not even close to fresh homemade bbq.  My husband and I decided to both get the smoked chicken sandwich, a side of fries, mashed potatoes and gravy and a slice of red velvet cake.  When she handed us our sandwiches she said "Take some extra sauce, the sandwiches are usually dry", extra sauce is fine, I slathered it on, but I found it strange that she put down the food right away.  It was dry and served on the most generic bun.  The sauce made up for it, I poured it on and it was good.  The best bbq chicken sandwich? I think not.  The fries were inedible.  They were gross and soggy.  The mashed potatoes were ok.  I had to scrape the gravy off the top, because it was a salty nastiness, and eat them plain.  I love gravy, I swear I think this is the first time in my life that I have not liked a gravy!  The red velvet cake was a huge disappointment.  I had envisioned something homemade and yummy.  Frankly it looked gross in the plastic container she handed me.  It was all smashed up and there was whipped cream all over the container.  Not good.....  Based on my experience here I would not go back.  I find it hard to believe that this is talked of as the best bbq in Phoenix.  I have had better bbq at chain restaurants.

I love Chompie's, but then again I am a sucker for a Monte Cristo sandwich and bagels.  I have been to this location twice now since I finally found somewhere besides Disneyland that I can get a Monte Cristo.  How can you not love this deep fried goodness dipped in a strawberry per-serve? Its huge, and its yummy, but I recommend sharing it with someone or you will regret it!  Haven't really had much else on their menu except just a breakfast bagel sandwich which was good also. Service is ok, but I don't expect much when I am at diners, I know I am not going to get 5 star service, so I usually don't get disappointed.  Their kids meals are great, and my son gets a huge cookie when he leaves, he loves this.

we decided to go here after receiving a gift card for xmas.  I had sworn off Applebee's many years ago, but decided to try it again, it was free after all. The service was terrible, our server gave us all different drinks than what we had ordered?!?  We tried to play it safe with our menu choices.  I choose a bacon cheeseburger, my husband choose the chicken Caesar salad.  They were both lousy.  My hamburger tasted like someone spilled a container of salt on it then wiped it off, gross.  I didn't think it was possible to mess up a bacon cheeseburger, but it was just too salty and generic.  My husbands chicken Caesar salad was lousy also, nothing special to it, and the chicken didn't taste very good.  All the way through our meal, our server didn't come over and ask if our food was ok, we also sat there for a very long time without any drink refills through our meal.  It was a unpleasant experience, and if I ever get another gift card, I will be re-gifting it

Terrible haunted attraction. Waited in line for 2 hours to get in, then there were only 5 scenes in the corn maze. There were hardly any actors, we just walked through corn with nothing jumping out at us. The very first scene we came to the actor was talking to another actor then he saw us and made a very sad attempt to scare us. It didn't work!  I would defintely not recommend this place. The corn mazes at Fear Farm were much better.

Love it!  The carne asada is so good in my opinion.  The shop is cute also, not much seating but if you don't go at prime time you will not have a problem.  I ate here twice last week because I was craving it so much! I also really liked their salsa and chips, more the salsa, and they keep it in the fridge so its super cold when they give it to you which I really like.  I just have had the quesadilla with carne asada so I can't say anything else about the rest of the food.  They could give you a bigger piece of lime with your meal though! :)

Had a wonderful dinner here Saturday night for my husbands birthday.  The service and food were excellent.  I got the filet which was cooked a perfect medium and had a brandy peppercorn sauce with it, it was fantastic.  My husband had the roasted chicken and it just melted in your mouth.  Absolutely loved the sticky buns they brought to the table.  It was like having dessert first.  Our server Stuart was one of the best waiters we have ever had.  Can't wait to return and sit outside when it's cooler, their outdoor seating area is beautiful with great views!

We stayed at the Golden Nugget so naturally we thought we would give their buffet a shot.  Terrible idea....When we first walked in we were not impressed at all.  The decor was tacky, screamed old people, country kitchen.  The selection was not the best.  Paid like $18.00 for champagne brunch.  My husband had some fried chicken which was extremely dry.  I opted for the chicken fried steak, which after one bite, was the worst chicken fried steak I have ever tasted!  It tasted like something from my old high school cafeteria.  We immediately went and got our money back.  We then took a cab to the Treasure Island buffet.  It was better, but still not great.  I am starting to think the Vegas Buffet idea is over hyped!

Wonderful, beautiful, professional shop.  One of the best I have ever been too.  The atmosphere is relaxed and everyone is very nice.  I had Apryl tattoo me and I couldn't be happier with my piece.  She was great to work with and understood what I wanted. The detail is amazing, the lines are perfect and the color is vibrant.  It was about a 4 hour session and she made sure I was comfortable the entire time, allowing for breaks whenever I needed them.  Looking forward to my next piece here already.  Highly recommend.

Great experience here.  I was a little nervous about the whole process but after talking to the doctor, Dr. Peachy, I feel great.  Everyone there is super nice and helpful, especially Brian at the front desk.  Professional and clean environment.

My favorite dispensary in Phoenix.  Good reward program, professional service, great flowers and great edibles that are usually always in stock.  Best hash in town! I have been to many dispensaries in Phoenix and I keep coming back to this one. Recently remodeled inside and it looks great in there.
