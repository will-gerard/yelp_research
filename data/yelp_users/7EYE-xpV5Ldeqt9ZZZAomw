Have you ever had a rainbow cookie? No? well you haven't tasted heaven. Go to the bakery counter, ask for a rainbow cookie, just do it.   I grew up in Long Island and have been living in various west coast cities for the last 5 years and nowhere makes me feel as at home as Chompie's does. Every time I'm there, I just feel so nostalgic and wish I could have everything on the menu displayed on the table in front of me as if my mom had just made way too much food for the holiday. Regardless of how awesome everything on the menu is, I will always order a Reuben. Sometimes if I'm feeling crazy I'll get the Reuben that has the coleslaw on it. Pastrami piled high, the perfect marble rye...I'm salivating right now. I am obsessed with the pickles they put on the table and the fried Matzo balls and can't say any bad things about this place.   It's rare you find a restaurant that can remind you of your childhood and make you feel giddy like you just discovered some kind of secret that no one else knows about. Thank's for being awesome and making me feel like I have a piece of my NY home in Scottsdale Chompie's.

I have to write an update to this chompie's review as they were a special part of one of the most amazing days, our Wedding in October 2014. due to my crazy love of Rainbow Cookies, I had the wonderful idea of having a rainbow cookie wedding cake so all of our wedding guests could share in the chocolatey deliciousness. Instead of actually having a full wedding cake, made the same way rainbow cookies are made, I ordered 15 pounds of rainbow cookies and then they were stacked in towers on a dessert table for us. The bite size of the cookies is what makes it extra special. The Staff was super helpful, delivered it on time to the venue and even communicated with our planner to provide stands for the cookies that matched my decor. We also used chompies the next day for bagels, cream cheeses, coffee, etc. for our wedding brunch. delivery that morning was also smooth and everyone loved the food. communication was on point throughout my entire planning process and It was so nice to have those pieces of New York for our wedding weekend.

We had a living social deal here plus its super close to my company's vacation condos so we just had to try it. It was delicious, 5 stars all around. Our server Chaz was friendly and and the service from everyone at the restaurant was impeccable. Very attentive, always filling our waters, but the perfect amount of also leaving us alone to enjoy the food and ambiance. We started with the sauteed calamari. I went in with every intention of ordering fried but I am so glad we chose the other preparation. It had just the right amount of spice and we absolutely loved it. We both got chicken dishes but I highly recommend the one my boyfriend ordered. Chicken with 4 cheeses is the easy way of saying it. The mushrooms that surrounded it and the perfection of the cheeses and prosciutto along with the chicken...just amazing. The prices are reasonable for what you get. The portions are large and the pasta and sauces are homemade.   If you're not sure where to go for Italian and you find yourself in the Kierland area, please do yourself a favor, don't support the chains like maggianos, head over to this local gem and you won't regret it.

Loved our staycation. All of our questions and issues were addressed quickly. They need to make sure the website is updated with the summer hours/ changes a bit more obviously but it did not ruin our stay. DO NOT MISS- Obadiah Parker in the center stage bar. What an amazing voice. Grab a seat in the lounge, order up a martini and enjoy the show. We had excellent service the entire weekend. SWB lunch is amazing, we did not get to eat at Alto because it was closed but SWB really was excellent. Adult pool was very relaxing, we never had an issue finding somewhere to sit in the shade, and I always love hyatt regency beds. Summer rates are great for AZ residents, don't miss out!

I really liked this place! It felt like a neighborhood deli which is what I miss from NY. The bacon egg and cheese bagel was delicious. When I go back next time I will give them the real NY test which is seeing how much cream cheese they spread on the bagel!

I am reviewing the nail services only here. Purchased a groupon for spa mani/pedi, amazing deal!!! I called right away and was able to get an appointment very easily. Becky is amazing. She was nice to chat with and my nails look phenomenal! I highly recommend Becky! I had to take it down to 4 instead if 5 only because of the space. It felt a bit cramped and I felt bad that the nail techs did not have more space to themselves. I look forward to seeing it when they move yhe

Orange Table- You are awesome. I love you so much that my boyfriend Dave T. knew that coming here for a romantic brunch on our anniversary would be my perfect day-date. Everytime I come here I always say, this time I'll eat actual breakfast food, alas the Rustler calls to me. I change it up in my own way on olive bread and with sprouts instead of lettuce and it is delicious every single time.   I stare at people in disbelief when they say they have never eaten here before. They have no clue the hidden gem they are missing out on. Your location is perfect, the food is excellent, service is always on point and extra friendly. As Dave said in his review, yes I would love to come here at least once a month for the rest of our lives (that means you're going to need to be in business for a reeeeeally long time) and if I could justify the cost, I'd start every one of my weekends off here.

Delicious chopped salad. You Must order this salad!! It is the same as citizen public house but waaaaaay better. I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 only because I think the menu could be better. It has staple items to order which it does amazingly like the mushroom dish, the chopped salad, and a few others but overall options are limited.   I prefer it for lunch personally because of the chopped salad.

Excellent happy hour! I wish it went a little bit later on weekdays. Flat bread was delicious as was my cocktail. Very relaxing patio and love that it's a little further out from the craziness that can be downtown Scottsdale

The first restaurant we went to when we moved to Arizona. It was moving day, we were starving and for some reason I had a huge hankering for some sodium filled Chinese food. Instead enter Malee's Thai. This place is amazing. I love the ambiance and the food can't be beat. I always order the evil jungle princess. The mushrooms are my favorite part of this dish and having left overs with some white rice the next day is something I actually look forward to after eating here.   Please, go here, I promise you will not regret the choice!

Only been here twice and on the first time it actually was really great, it wasn't a weekend night so i'm guessing that may have been why. My last time here was an absolute disaster. We were sat outside at first while waiting for an inside table to open up. the misters are blocked by the sunshades so that doesn't make any sense at all, and it was super hot. 25 minutes go by and still no one has come by with even glasses of water let alone to take an order. that entire 25 minutes there were waiters going to all of the other outdoor tables.   We finally get a waitress to take our order and than we get moved to an inside table. So now we're inside, another 25 minutes or so goes by and we finally get most of our food except the shrimp tempura roll. The food was great, got the viva vegas roll, edamame, and a few other happy hour rolls. We finish all of the food and the shrimp tempura roll still is not out. Asked multiple times about it and kept getting the "right away" response. When it finally did arrive, I literally looked at the plate and said we waited all that time for this? It looked so scrawny. I think they used half a shrimp for all 5 little pieces and more rice than I've ever seen on a roll.   Other than the timing issues and the lame-o shrimp tempura roll, the food is pretty good and I would give them another shot if we don't have anywhere else to go to of our Old Town restaurants.

Have been back a few more times now since the happy hour deals are so great and I always go on a weeknight now. Service is much better than on the weekends, deals are great and food is good. Join their email club too, they are always sending out discounts.

Great for a quick meal and open a lot later on weekdays than we thought so yay for that! Excellent service. Pepperoni is thick sliced and delicious. We also got a salad, small is perfect for 2 or even 3 people to share, but get the large if you want to have leftovers for lunch the next day! Sign up for the birthday thing, they reward your loyalty with a free large pie which is awesome!

Went for brunch on a weekday. I'm definitely a fan of this place. I ordered the croquet madam which is amazing, it is a MUST order if you go for brunch. The fries that come with it are delicious as well and a very generous portion. The reason I am giving this 4 stars is the croquet madam was a 5 but my bf's steak and eggs, I thought only a 3. It definitely could have had more flavor and while it was tasty, left a bit to be desired. Décor and ambiance are great and service was top notch. Would definitely return on our next visit and just order something better for the second option next time.

Gelato Spot has great tasting food. Service is really great as well but I am a bit thrown off by the fact that I actually liked it being an order at the counter kind of place. Every time I go I order the cobb salad which is so amazingly delicious! This past weekend I gave the focaccia chop salad a shot. so simple and refreshing and I wish my homemade salads tasted that great.   the focaccia at the bottom of the salad got so well covered in vinagrette that I just could not stand not eating every piece. Just go, enjoy it, pig out on some gelato after. Simple, good food

The service at this place makes you feel like a movie star. The patio is beautiful and pretty much every seat is shaded which is great. I got the salmon Benedict which was a super generous portion of salmon and so fresh. Bf got the duck confit hash. It was delicious and very savory so you will need to be in the mood for a bit of a heavier breakfast if you order that. Don't miss this brunch on your visit to Vegas. The Wynn is always classy and my favorite hotel. this restaurant is an excellent experience for those looking to enjoy the elegant part of Vegas.

Get the gnocchi. The waitress described it as pillows of happiness and she is 100% correct. We went for a quick bite after a long week of work and it met all my wants. Quiet, friendly, comforting food.   Will have to go back when I have time to relax with a cocktail and nosh board. That is what the neighboring tables were doing and it looked perfect.

This is my go to place for a solid margarita night. Love their chicken quesadillas and the fajitas are good too. Go during happy hour, such good deals. The service is great, and all of the food is awesome. Only thing on the menu I don't like is the cheese crisp, it's like a weird version of a Mexican pizza or something, pass on that.

Love this place so much. They have happy hour all summer in the bar area. This is a great date night or girls night out restaurant. The Brussel sprouts are a must order. Just get a bunch of small plates so you can try everything! Black cod entree was delicious.

Absolutely love this place. 5 Stars through and through. My boyfriend and I came on Valentine's day this year and the service was excellent as well as the food. That night, we wanted to go all out so we each ordered our own steak and had the lobster mashed potatoes, and the butter cake for dessert. All of it was amazing.   Most recently we tried it out a second time because we had gotten a gift card. They had sat us in the back of the restaurant but I requested to be seated in the main dining room and they of course moved us right away to a great little booth. I like the main dining room better because it has a see and be seen vibe to it and you can hear the music from the lounge area which is always great.  Every time I go there we will always get the stuffed mushrooms and request extra pretzel bread. Every time I take a bit of those I just wish I knew how to make them myself. For main course we decided to share the Chef's cut Rib Eye and get the Mac n cheese and Brussel sprouts. I highly recommend if your shying away from Mastro's because of price, that is an excellent option. You get an unbelievably juicy and delicious steak, they split it for us into 2 plates and the sides were delicious. Thanks for another amazing night out Mastro's. Nailed it.

Love the happy hour. 5 stars for the happy hour drink specials but I think only 3 stars for the food. It's pretty basic but hits the spot. Happy hour until 8 pm which is amazing for those of us who work until 6!

Starting to really love the food here. They recently changed the menu and happy hour is all night during summer time! What could be better? Service was really great, everyone was so nice and extra helpful. Only thing that could have been done different is the waitress brought the check waaayyy too early. We were still in the middle of our meal and had half a glass of wine each left, it was strange. Maybe she was just in a rush to get done with work for the night. I highly recommend the chicken nachos and the turkey burger is awesome too. For the side order, get waffle fries. Why don't more restaurants offer waffle fries any more, it's a shame! Well, daily dose does...go get them :)

Went here because of seeing it on food network. I find it highly overrated. If I had a kid who was always playing at ice den, I would probably go here often for convenience.  It's basic, super greasy, not healthy at all breakfast but definitely would not go out of my way to get here. It was fine, Denny's is better. I tried to be healthy and ordered something with spinach and eggs but my dish and toast was actually watery from the spinach I think.

We had made a reservation and they said they didn't have it but no problem because they improvised and were able to seat us anyway! Bruschetta was really good, wine was also delicious. I would give my meal 5 stars for flavor but 3 stars for value. I ordered the bourbon glazed salmon which was $21.95 and came with vegetables and Quinoa. The vegetables it came with was a squash cut into 4 pieces so I asked for another side of veggies and they very quickly brought it over. For the price, I would have been a bit bitter had they not brought over the extra veg. Boyfriend got one of their burgers and it was amazing. Fries were delicious as well. Overall a very romantic, classy place with great service. The live music is nice and it is even a nice place to enjoy a late night glass of wine.

This has become one of our go to date night restaurants. We both order the same things every single time. Some bruschettas to start, I get the cobb salad and husband gets the 5th and wine burger. It's amazing every time. For a nice relaxing ambiance, friendly service, delicious food and occassional live music, this restaurant is perfect. The cobb is the best cobb salad i've ever had. I love the way they do the egg on top and the mixture of ingredients they add to make it their own special version.

Oh my gosh where do I begin? BF and I got reservations for restaurant week here last night but didn't even do the restaurant week menu because they just serve too many delicious things that we did not want to miss. The ambiance is great, I loved it when they opened the restaurant up to allow us to enjoy the amazing weather we've been getting lately and our waitress was excellent and very attentive.   Started off with the Grilled cheese and soup appetizer. I wish that every single time in the past I was craving comfort food, I had been able to order this dish. The grilled cheese is deliciously gooey and the soup was the perfect consistency for dipping. I ordered the Shrimp and Sausage entree and Dave got the Short ribs. Short ribs looked like kind of a small serving but I think it was because of the size of the plate. We also felt there was not enough potato with the short rib. Regardless of size, he wanted to lick the plate clean but I wouldn't let him for fear of embarrassment. My shrimp and sausage dish was perfection. The grits were creamy and buttery and the amount of shrimp served was just right. Dessert time, bacon covered in chocolate? for reals? Yes! their twist on smores was different than anything I've ever eaten and I loved every bite.   Can't wait to visit again and try the sausage pasta that our server recommended!

LOVE your brunch. the patio is so relaxing and I love being here for brunch when the market is going on and a little live music is playing. What could make you love living in Scottsdale more than the fact that places like Herb Box exist for your enjoyment? Food was excellent, service is always great and the décor makes me wish I had enough money to hire their decorator for my house one day. This is the perfect place for ladies who lunch and the patio is pet friendly too!

I don't know what is going on at this restaurant but it's not good. We bought a groupon because we've eaten at the location in Denver and loved it and know its a bit on the pricey side. The second we walked in by the hostess stand, it smelled terrible, almost a sewage issue smell, and no it did not smell bad outside. We sat on the patio but then the people next to us started smoking so we moved inside. Sewage smell would waft around every once in a while. We started off with the spinach salad which was pretty good. We opted for Half house special and half funky Q BBQ on our pizza. Both sounded awesome so we were excited to get it. Meh, definitely not great. One of my pet peeves is when pizza dough can't handle the toppings, the second you pick it up, all of the toppings slid off. I had to eat it with a fork and knife. It was super greasy and just Meh all around.   The service was fine, everyone seemed pretty indifferent and bored being there. The general environment just felt like a dirty college restaurant, which I guess makes sense since it's on Mill. I was just hoping since it's a chain, that it would still be decently maintained. When we left we saw our waiter hanging out in the t-shirt shop area of the restaurant on his cell phone and unprofessional things being said between waiters while we were eating. It was just an overall strange experience. Definitely won't go here ever again and don't recommend it.

I love greek food and I am middle eastern, this place is awesome! Service is here has been so friendly every single time, price is right and the food is delicious. The french fries are exactly the way I remember french fries being outside of the US. I can't explain it, they are the perfect size, the perfect amount of crunchy but soft and were cooked in the perfect amount of oil. No shoestring gross, oily fries here!!! This has become our favorite go to place to grab a quick bite before going to the movies. Try the souvlaki or shwarma combos!

Butters is close to my office so I must say in this review I'm a bit biased because they are so convenient for lunch and always get my to go order ready really quickly. My constants are either the cobb salad with honey mustard or the California chicken club with French fries. I'm unhealthily addicted to the French fries and would put the honey mustard dressing on absolutely anything I would eat ever. It's home made and delicious. Now the reason this is only a 4 star is your pricing. $3.45 for 3 scrawny pieces of bacon that are as thin as 2 pencils put next to each other? really? And over $5.00 for an Orange Juice? I know it's Scottsdale but re-visit that pricing structure Butters! Either way, my wallet may eternally be unhappy with me, but I will continue to be loyal because of the convenience and the consistency of deliciousness.

5 stars every time. Love the happy hour. If my dog could speak, he would probably beg me to take him to the OHSO back patio more often. Thanks for being so uber dog friendly OHSO! The burgers here are not to be missed and grab a pitcher of beer, it usually makes more sense financially and you're going to want to hang out for a while.

I've been to Teres a few times for Mani/ Pedis. This past week I got super lucky and they were able to fit me in after a terrible experience elsewhere which had left my nails all scratched up and ugly. Lacy was wonderful, they had the exact color I wanted and so many options that I think it would be impossible for them to not have what someone is looking for. I will definitely continue coming here for all of my manicures from now on. I'm not as sold on the pedicures because I really miss the massage chairs you get at other places as opposed to Teres' bench like seating over the pedicure sinks, but overall this place really is a gem.

Loved every single second of being in this restaurant. The service was great, it was great décor and the food was delicious. Get the shrimp and grits, you will not regret it. Another can't miss is the brussell sprouts side, such awesome flavor. Searsucker also looks like an amazing place to have an event like a rehearsal dinner or a trendy special occasion restaurant. Will most definitely be back.

For a special occasion this restaurant was perfection. The server was so attentive and friendly and the food was incredible. I loved the calamari and filet. We had an amazing dessert that was a tower of cookies and cream popcorn over ice cream. Very unique. Most steak restaurants have similar menus but steak 44 really impresses and provides a twist in every dish. I highly recommend it for the ambiance as well. While a bit of a maze, every table feels private and the atmosphere is the epitome of cool. The final touch which really put them over 5 stars is that they called me the next day to ask hoe everything was. Who does that??? Only people who truly care about their customers and reputation.

Fried pickles and Ranch! I love this place. I can't wait to try the free dance lessons on Wednesday nights. The food is delicious and the vibe is so laid back and welcoming. I love that it's a bit outside of the busy nightlife area of old town/ downtown scottsdale. Everyone who works at The Western is really nice and the live music is great. get the fried pickles, a burger and one of their awesome drinks and enjoy.

This is my go to Bbq right now. The nacho flat is amazing, the bacon board, brisket, just everything!!!!!! The absolute only thing I would change is to have the burger served on a regular dish instead of the wood board. I get it but it's already so messy without the delicious sauce dripping off the board onto the table. Regardless you should order the burger with fries. You won't regret it!!!! Vibe is casual but can be romantic and trendy and they have interesting happy hour deals too!!!

No, just no. I'm upset and feeling all things not great about this new place. Location is fine and patio is great as always but that is where it ends. The food is meh and why did you change the menu? If business is going well and people love you, why change it?! Change is definitely not always good. I thought you were just upgrading location. That new menu of yours is terrible, there's barely anything on it worth ordering. We ordered the happy hour nachos, there was a puddle of water at the bottom of the plate, maybe from watery salsa? who knows but it was weird and they only tasted okay. How can it be that your only quesadilla on the menu is veggie? Why are your tacos made in child size and cost $3 each? Why, why why oh why ever change?!  Please, do us all a favor and have re-re-opening party with the old menu back and celebrating all of the good old cheap awesome Mexican food and margaritas that we all loved. I used to go here at least every other week if not more for happy hour, now it's very unlikely saltys will come to mind when we are choosing where to go.

I don't know what the bad reviews are! People in a cranky mood, who were at a different restaurant is the only explanation.   This place was so great for dinner. Definitely trying to give off a higher end vibe, which is fine, I appreciate great fine dining service! But they don't even have to go that fancy with the service, the food seriously speaks for itself and is wonderful. We had the spinach dip to start which was fantastic and the best I've had. It came with delicious slices of bread and sun dried tomato. Fiance had the short rib, a perfect portion size and delicious. I ordered the steak cobb with a side of mac n cheese. The mac n cheese was great, I wouldn't say I need it but it was definitely tasty. The salad on the other hand was so beautiful in presentation and I loved every bite. I didn't even use the blue cheese dressing they brought on the side. The vinaigrette it is tossed in is perfect.   Service could not have been better- our waters were never empty, servers were attentive while not being annoying or overbearing and the ambiance is quiet. You can get away with being both casual and dressy here.  I highly recommend Paul Martins for Lunch or Dinner. The servers are excellent and the food top notch.

For thin crust pizza at it's finest, be sure to head here to Pizza Me! being that it is so close to my office, we've eaten lunch from there twice now and it's been great each time. I loved the classic margherita pizza and will prob have that be my go to for now. Others tried pizzas with meat on them and the sausage is actually really yummy too, so highly recommend that as a topping! Thanks for being a great price, and a great take out option! Only giving this 4 stars because I have never experienced the actual restaurant, service, or tried anything other than 2 personal pizzas from there so maybe if I try more, it will earn it's 5th star!

It is such a big place! Located where Abe's deli used to be but this is definitely an upgrade. The patio looks really nice, I can't wait to visit it with our pup. Order the turkey burger. I love turkey burgers and try them almost everywhere we go, this one was something special for sure, with a mountain of delicious french fries!   The interior is really pretty and the service was super friendly. You won't regret it!

Not good, overall just not good. We had a large group and our poor server seemed so overwhelmed. She actually did a good job getting everyone's orders but then who knows what happened in the kitchen. Half the table never got any food at all, some of us decided not even to order entrees because it took so long for anything to come out. I did get to eat the gravy fries which were actually very tasty. A little too much salt but still liked it. The Mac n cheese was side order size and something I could have made myself. It was decent but nothing to get excited about so whoever wrote the menu is just really good about describing things in a fanciful way.   Now the chicken tenders. I heard the waitress telling someone else that they were so popular they made an adult version. I love chicken tenders so I ordered them. It was like cardboard microwaved chicken. Took 2 bites and sent it back. I was in shock. Chicken tenders are usually so good to me because of the different ways that restaurants bread and fry em up. The tots were like what you get at elementary school lunch. I'm sorry union but for kids maybe okay, the only adults who would eat that are ones who are too drunk to notice what you just put in front of them.   Location and decor is great. Figure out your kitchen timing, revisit some of the menu items and this place could be really successful.

came in because of the grand opening special of $39.99 massage. It was really great! I added $10 for deep tissue and Teresa was wonderful. So friendly and really worked hard on my horribly tense shoulders. She checked in periodically during the massage to see how I was doing with the pressure and I felt she was very attentive and knowledgeable. I would definitely recommend this to friends and would go here again. It is a bit hard to find because there are a few day spa type of business in the same shopping center. This place is down the stairs and sign says Massage.

Very friendly service both during happy hour and on a random weekend daytime stop in. They're food is pretty good as are the drinks. Half off appetizers and $5 wines make it a perfect weekday happy hour spot. I also love that the patio allows for excellent people watching.

I loved this place. I had never been to the bungalow so can't compare lookswise but being a new yorker, this place is amazing and really reminds me of bars/ restaurants on the east end of Long Island. All that's missing is the sand and ocean! I highly recommend the fish tacos, they were delicious. The only reason this is not a 5 star for me is the drinks are really expensive. I think the cocktail I ordered, while delicious was something like $14 dollars and the glass wasn't even filled to the top. It had an enormous square ice cube in it too, which while cool looking- it didn't leave a lot of surface area for the glass to be filled with alcohol- which is what you want for $14 a glass. For that reason, I only ordered one drink, and am hesitant to make this a place for regular visits. They also need to figure out their happy hour and didn't have any desserts available, although there were some listed on the menu.   I think they still have a bit more growing to do so I'll give them a month or so and try it again, but I'm definitely a fan and loved the ambiance both indoors and on the patio!

As a pregnant woman, it's already difficult enough to find something on a menu that sounds good to you when you have food aversions, restrictions, nausea and exhaustion and our waiter did not help at all. I just wanted to go out and catch up with a girlfriend at a casual, comfortable spot close to my office. I was able to walk there which was perfect and then as soon as we sat down i asked about the Cesar salad, to see if they make the dressing with raw egg. He insisted there is no egg in the dressing, he didn't even have to ask, so we said great give us a minute. About 10 minutes later he finally comes back to our table and says that in fact yes there is egg in the dressing. At that point, i was frustrated it took him so long to come back to us for our order and now just plain annoyed. I asked if i could just get some grilled chicken breast and order a side or an appetizer with it and he said NO. He insisted they won't just put chicken breast on a plate for me but what i could do is order the chicken sandwich and then just get nothing on it or with it. that sandwich is $13.00 and he was completely serious in his suggestion. I explained to him that i'm pregnant and having one of those days where nothing sounds good to me, can he just work with me here so i can have something to eat but he insisted there was nothing he could do, I would have to order a full entire meal off of the menu.  So i ordered the chicken sandwich had a few bites and took the rest home to my husband. I should have asked for a manager, or if the waiter wanted to be helpful, he should have suggested that he would go ask his manager if he could accommodate my request. I was almost in tears because of how complicated ordering was (pregnant lady hormones and everything) and Twisted Grove seemed to care less. The menu does sound good if I was not pregnant but because of the service here, i'm not interested in giving it another shot, I'll stick to Grassroots, the service there is leaps and bounds above and menu has much more variety.
