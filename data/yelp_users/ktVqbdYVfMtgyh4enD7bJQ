I'll start by saying that Barbecued  Pork is my absolute favorite food.  I could eat BBQ Pork and coleslaw every single day if I knew I'd live.  And Hap's definitely delivered on awesome barbecue.  To me, I want the people who make my bbq to have a passion for the pit, to love the craft, because really, it is a craft.  And as soon as I walked in the lady (owner?) behind the counter spoke to me with such dedication about how Hap's barbecues their pork...and why it was the best joint in town. Awesome.  She also hooked me up with some extra pork because I couldn't decide what I wanted...everything just sounded too good and mouth couldn't stop watering. That's customer service.  When I did finally decide and got my order it was just what I wanted. Succulent pulled pork on an open faced sandwich that wasn't skimpy on the sauce.  The sauce was incredible too, a really flavorful zing that was way beyond what you can get in the grocery store.  My meal also came with delicious and moist corn bread and a good helping of coleslaw....you just can't get bbq pork with out coleslaw..Im sorry but its absolutely necessary :P  Bottom line, awesome joint where the people really care about the food they make which definitely shows.

The coolest, most unique shop in Arizona.  Yucatan Imports is quietly nestled in a nice little garden area off Mill Ave. by the custom t-shirt shops and is definitely worth a look.  Everytime I walk in the guy behind the counter is super nice and friendly and offers alot of knowledge about the items in the store.  There is just so much amazing stuff here, the Singing bowls and prayer wheels from Tibet are my favorite and Everything in the store is hand selected and imported by the owner.  They also have the best selection of Hemp bracelets I've found to date. Very cool.

While I'm not much of a Hippie nor a Gypsy per se, I can't really comment on much of the items in this place used for...ahem...uh, "elevating one's conscience"?. However, I do like to Zen out and burn incense often and the Hippie Gypsy has the best selection of incense in town, they must have around 50 or so different kinds which is awesome and they're really inexpensive as well so I usually pick up around 20sticks for 2$.  The Hippies that work there are usually pretty cool too.

Awesome, Awesome, place to relax with some good friends.  And probably the best Hookah I've had in Tempe as well.  I had never done Hookah too much and it had been awhile since I had gone but my girlfriend and a friend of mine wanted to go again one Tuesday night so the first spot we went too (which was the closest to us) was Cafe Istanbul on Apache.  When we entered we weren't even greeted by the worker, just ushered to a very uncomfortable spot near the door.  All three of us were getting really bad vibes once we sat down, the place just did not feel like a Hookah bar...so we left and then went to Red Sea, thankfully.       As soon as we entered the Red Sea there were two really cool dudes that greeted us and made us feel welcome.  Like I said, we were sorta new to Hookah and they gave us some awesome suggestion and talked to us for about 5mins.  These guys really  know (and love) their Hookah.   We picked the Raspberry Lemonade, which was wonderful and smooth and fairly inexpensive as well, only about 5$ total for each of us (including my military discount).    *The Best thing about this place is the atmosphere in the lounge, its very dark with calming red lights throughout.  They have huge couches and a pillow spot on the floor which was our favorite.  What's pretty cool and unique and actually really adds to the chilllll atmosphere is the Classic Rock they play, It seriously completed my night when "Mary Jane's Last Dance" by Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers played.  Seriously, Hookah Bars don't get any better than this place.

For some reason, I don't know why, I had heard that Pete's fish and chips was a Tempe staple...if this true I have no idea why.  I mean, sure, the place is extremely well priced (3 of us ate here for less than a Jefferson). But I guess you get what you paid for because when my order arrived I hadn't been so disappointed since the Lost series finale.  The "fish", i guess that's what I ate, was hard as a rock, I was thinking about taking it home to play street hockey with later...it was that bad and it had no flavor what so ever.  Our meals also came with some "shrimp" and again, the dubious quotations are necessary.  I have never ate "shrimp" like that in my life..it was a small amount of shrimp-esque mush fried in a few tablespoons of batter...and it was similarly unflavorful..unless you call grease a flavor, which I do not.

In today's age of impersonal cookie cutter places to buy music such as Best Buy, Target, and FYE, a place like Zia really stands out.  The place is wall to wall with music (and movies) which makes it a little cramped sometimes, but that's just how I like my record store to be. I myself, love listening to Vinyl records, i love the scratchy, 'dirty' sound of a record...to me that will always beat a cd, and definitely an Mp3.  Thus, I come here often to buy vinyls and Zia has a pretty awesome selection...and very reasonable prices.  My last find was a Jan Hammer vinyl record that was the soundtrack to Miami Vice in the 80s...awesome 80s techno beats, Im a big fan of the show and loved the score,so that was a really great find for me.  I also purchased "Born In The USA" by Springsteen for only 1.99$, one of the best records of all time, in vinyl form, for less than 2bucks?? helll yeah!  This place also has unique releases that only record stores will get such as a special two song Vinyl release by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers a couple months ago, so stop in sometime, you never know what treasure you'll find ;)

Despite the fact that I've lived pretty much on campus for 3 years now, I had never ventured, until recently, to any of the restaurants in the 'block' between Mill Ave/University Drive/ and Sun Devil Stadium.  I wish I hadn't waited so long once I went to the Phoenicia Cafe.  Its definitely one of the most authentic restaurants I've been to in Phx/Tempe, which is always a plus.  The restaurant  is located in a building shared with an Arabic food market, which is cool if you want to try something different to cook at home.  Besides the awesome location and atmosphere of the restaurant, the second awesome thing I noticed once I went here was the waiter, who was probably one of the nicest waiters Ive ever had.  As soon as we sat down he started making jokes and being friendly, which made us feel very welcome and friendly.  Now on to the food.  As I said, Phoenicia is a very authentic place and thus being so they have amazing Mediterranean dishes.  I love gyros, so I got the Gyro Pita Boat (i guess they also have a dish of just the gyro meat too, which ill have to try next time) and my girlfriend got the falafel and hummus.  Both of our meals were generously portioned and really flavorful, you can really taste the authentic spices they use in the gyro meat, the falafel, and the hummus, which really makes a different.  And maybe even better than the food itself was the drinks, they have fresh fruit nectar  which are amazing and go great with I would imagine anything on the menu.  To top off our dinner, we ordered Baklava for dessert.  The Baklava here, Im not exaggerating at all, is by far, the best I have ever head..it's sugary heaven.  All in all, pretty much every aspect of the Phoenicia is great, a perfect spot for lunch or dinner on campus at ASU. I definitely will be back again soon.

I'm pretty much as carnivorous as a T-Rex but my girlfriend is a Vegetarian...a combination which sometimes makes it hard for us to find a restaurant that has something for us both.  We also like to try places that are 'different' as well.  That's why when we randomly wandered in to Cornish Pastry Company we were definitely happy and surprised.  First off, the place has an hole-in-the-wall feel to it, definitely a cool Blue Collar working Pub atmosphere that seemed unique and not kitschy.  The menu has so many delicious options too...plenty of meat filled pockets for me and Veggie options for her and each meal is definitely filling.  I had never had a Cornish Pastry before and the little bit of British history on the menu added to the experience.  The Pastries are pretty much like giant Hot Pockets...but giant hot pockets like your grandma would make if she made giant hot pockets..IE: delicious, filling, natural, and did I say delicious? stuffed with all kinds of meat, veggies, mashed potatoes, spices, etc.  Definitely try it!

I would never have thought I could be so in love with Cupcakes, which I always thought were sort of 'blah', But Sprinkles Cupcakes are seriously from Heaven, its what I imagine the Greek Gods snack on on Mt. Olympus. They're seriously THAT good.  My favorite, by far, is the Red Velvet Cupcake which is honestly probably the most delicious 'cake' or dessert item I've ever had.  Go there now.  Oh and become a fan of them on Facebook because they always have great weekly cupcake give-aways.

As someone who came out to ASU from the Midwest, I have to admit that one of my favorite things in Tempe is the In N Out by the 202.  Before I came out here, everyone I had talked to from the West Coast raved about In N Out burger and they hype is well deserved.    In N Out is fast food, but its the most fresh and flavorful burger I have ever had, and for some reason, even the bun tastes better than at most places.  And for anyone totally new to the place, order Animal Style on your burger, you'll definitely be glad you did.

I'm a junior at ASU and drove past this place on university for THREE years until I finally went in....that was a mistake.  Now I go there whenever I can.   Though while on the outside, it looks like just a chain bagel place, its way more than that.  Chompies sandwiches taste just like (to me) some of the best Jewish delis Ive been to in NYC...honestly, its that good.      My faves:          **Jewish Sliders-What Chompies is best known for (as well as featured on Man VS Food for), a very hearty combo of 3 cholla rolls filled brisket, mini potato pancakes & Jack cheese, and a side of gravy. THE BEST Sandwich I have had in Arizona, hands down.           **The Brooklyner Triple Decker-(pastrami, corned beef, and braised brisket on double baked Jewish rye).  It has it all, the only thing I do to it is ask the server to add coleslaw too it which puts it over the top

It seems as if every time Im on Mill I can't resist going to Cookiez.  They're right next to what used to be a Cold Stone which is sort of funny, but seriously, they're way above that place.  I always go for the Peanut Butter Cup Ice Cream Cookie sandwich, which is soo good.  The ice cream they have is awesome and the cookies might even be better.  The owner of the place is a real nice guy too and the girls that work there are always very friendly and pretty cool.  One time while I was there, some idiot came in and wanted to lecture the girl working on how the place's title should include "ice cream" as well to let people know exactly what they have, as well as how they should sell 3 cookies for a dollar like otis spunkmeyer...which is a totally ridiculous comparison, i mean, really? but the girl was really nice and listened to him and when she left rolled her eyes, he didn't even go in there to buy anything, just to complain, what a jerk, haha.  But yeah, back to the review...best ice cream in town, definitely recommend on an insanely hot Arizona summer day ( or any day for that matter)  and oh, they have really amazing smoothies too, my girlfriend isn't much of an ice cream person so when we go she always gets one of the Smoothies, which are made from fresh fruit and juice and taste natural and fresh..because they are, ha.

Here's the thing, I've been here quite a few times and absolutely Love their Pad Thai, the best in Tempe after Tipps closed down.  However, the past two times I have been here I've gotten really bad service.  Last night I ordered the usual shrimp and chicken pad thai with the vegetable egg rolls and sweet n sour sauce as an appetizer.  We waited, and waited, for the eggrolls to come and about 15 minutes in we finally saw our waitress again..bringing out the eggrolls with our main meals...which was disappointing because we were starving and would have really enjoyed an appetizer.   First I noticed there was no sauce with the eggrolls and then, I realized that my Pad Thai came without shrimp, I waited for over five minutes for my waitress to come back but she was nowhere in sight so I told the hostess and she said she'd fix it, another five minutes passed and when she returned there were only two shrimp with it, i mean, seriously? You forget to give me shrimp and then 'remedy' the situation by only giving me two? Not enough.  Our actual waitress did not come by AT ALL for the remainder of our meal, not even to refill our waters once.  Also, the previous time I ate at Thai Rama the service was similarly bad.  While the food is indeed awesome, I don't think I'll stop by again due to the service

Since I've been out in Arizona, I've been somewhat disappointed in the lack of any really cool/unique/art like movie theaters, for my taste at least...except for MADCAP, that is.  The theater is located in a really nice, somewhat quiet area on the unique Mill Ave.  MADCAP brings in some really awesome older cult movies to watch at the theater, what's better than seeing one of your favorite older movies on the big screen??       I check constantly online to see what they're playing, my favorite that I've seen there was A Nightmare On Elm Street 2 and 3 double feature that even included the original trailers that showed with them in the 80's, very fun.  And this weekend I'm definitely not gonna miss their screening of Evil Dead II.  If you're into indie movies or cult classics, definitely come to Madcap

Arizona seems to lack good Greek food, especially Gyros...that's why being from the Midwest I was so happy when a good Gyro place finally opened in Tempe.  It's in a great location, right on the corner of University and McClintock so It's easy to get to on the way to or from class.  Their Gyro is very well portioned and is way bigger than any other Gyro I had in Arizona.  Their Gyro meat is well spiced there's definitely alot of it in the pita along with a good helping of the cucumber sauce that really accentuates the meat.  I usually just get the Gyro by itself and that usually enough to fill me up...wow, just describing the place makes me want to make a quick run and grab it for dinner right now, seriously.
